I honestly dreaded what this Christmas would feel like for me since my breakup, but I have to say it was awesome being able to come home to a quiet clean home free of plastic toys, gift wrapping, and packaging. I didnt go crazy at the stores trying to find all the kids gifts. Im starting to gift more money these days. Its so much easier and practically zero-waste.

Given that he‚Äôs 13 years older and holds a high political position, I thought he‚Äôd remain just a fantasy‚Äîsomeone to motivate me and escape to in my mind.

A few months later, I added him on one of his social media profiles, and to my surprise, he messaged me immediately. We exchanged numbers and eventually bumped into each other. He invited me for coffee, and I said yes. We had a great time, and I learned he‚Äôs married but separated, while I shared that I‚Äôm in a long-term relationship.

Over the following months, we sporadically exchanged (flirty) messages (initially initiated by me, then mostly by him). Eventually, we decided to meet, and while nothing physical happened, we talked for hours, laughed, and connected. We met twice more, and during our last meeting, he shared intimate details about his wife‚Äôs infidelity. It felt strange and I am still not sure what was the true point of that. Also it made me realize I was betraying my own boyfriend in a similar way.

I decided I needed to focus on my relationship and called my LO to end things. I explained that we couldn‚Äôt keep communicating, and he was understanding. He expressed regret for not having someone like me in his life, even as a friend or ""flirt friend"" (a term I disliked because I felt our connection was deeper).

Now, it‚Äôs been a few days of no contact, and it‚Äôs incredibly painful. Knowing I won‚Äôt hear from him again feels like a physical ache. His messages had become my source of serotonin, and I‚Äôm struggling with the emptiness. I‚Äôve tried no contact before and failed, but this time feels different because I‚Äôve committed to it, both to myself and to him.

If anyone has advice on how to cope or thoughts on my story, I‚Äôd really appreciate the support. I‚Äôm feeling lost and could use some guidance.

But anyway, I started working with a new manager with previous barista experience, and at our other branch which is roughly a billion times busier. there's a ton of little things they do that I've read are bad practice, but because I've got no experience and honestly my actual skills arent good, I can't really say anything about it. just to be clear, I'm letting them do stuff their way especially at their own branch, but sometimes they coach me to do things their way and I'm not comfortable with some of it

Things like:
-letting leftover steamed warm milk sit in pitchers for forever and just topping it up when the next customer comes in and then resteaming
-not washing or rinsing milk pitchers
- hitting the metal part of the tamper against the portafilter
-not wiping the leftover old grounds out of the portafilter with a cloth after knocking it (when I brought it up they said it was a waste of time and when I said ""all the training they sent me to told me to wipe it thoroughly"" they said ""well none of the places I've WORKED had me do it"" and thats the only time I spoke up haha)
- letting the old pucks sit in the portafilter until the next drink to keep the warmth in (is this a thing?)
- letting the portafilters sit out on the drip tray overnight or soak in water overnight
- not cleaning the grinder for months or years
- trying to dial in without purging shots between adjustments (I think most people agree the guy who does this isn't going about it the right way though haha)

Sin√©ad Whelehan's ""Alien"" Photo, ""Awakening"" & the Manipulation of Spacetime
","**Contact activist¬†Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan obtained a photo of an ‚ÄúET‚Äù while participating in a CE-5.¬†Her story reveals not only the power of contact to transform a person‚Äôs world view but also provides a dramatic example of how UFO intelligences manipulate spacetime.**

**Joseph Burkes MD 2023**

**Introduction**

Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan is a contact activist that I met in November of 2021 when she produced an online video interview with me for the¬†**‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù website**. At that time, she had been working with researcher/author Grant Cameron for two years gaining experience as a researcher and interviewer. According to her brief bio on the ‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù webpage Sin√©ad¬†is a lifelong experiencer of multiple forms of paranormal high strangeness ‚Äúas well as being a lifelong spiritual practitioner.‚Äù¬†

I subscribe to Jeff Mara‚Äôs Podcast and when I saw her picture appear as a guest on his YouTube channel, I wanted to hear what she had to say. My curiosity was piqued when I read the provocative title of the program ‚Äú**Alien Stands Next To Her AT CE-5 Event ‚Äì ALIEN PHOTO.‚Äù**¬†

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s)

The event that she describes in which a small ‚Äúalien‚Äù being is photographed next to her during CE-5 fieldwork reminded me of an encounter that I had with my contact team one night in the Santa Monica Mountains in 1993.

**High Strangeness in Malibu Canyon**  
  
For five years back in the 1990s, I was a contact team leader for the CE-5 Initiative. Our group staged repeated Human Initiated Contact Events (HICE) in Southern California. During one outing the team was operating high up overlooking Malibu Canyon. While in deep meditation, I felt a strong pleasant pressure sensation in the middle of my chest. In retrospect, I imagine that my heart chakra was opening wide, because I was filled with a powerful peaceful loving feeling. After the meditation was over, my teammate, United Airlines Captain Joe Vallejo, told me the following:¬†

He stated that at one point during the meditation he had slightly opened his eyes. There, standing directly in front of me, was a small ‚Äúboxy‚Äù non-human being. Its rectangular form was only about two feet high, and it stood motionlessly less than twelve inches away from me. He reported that when he opened his eyes wide to get a better look, the rectangular form disappeared.¬†

**Sin√©ad ‚Äôs Photograph Obtained During Volunteer Contact Work**

During the last 20 minutes of Jeff Mara‚Äôs interview, Sin√©ad showed the photograph mentioned in the title of the program.¬†The digital picture was taken during an Illinois CE-5 nighttime outing in 2021. According to Sin√©ad, it was light blasted to bring out the details not easily seen because the picture was taken at night.¬†**Aside from the light blasting, no other alterations of the photograph were reportedly made.**¬†Sin√©ad gives her description of the photograph during the interview as follows:

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†This is a random photograph that was taken by a woman I didn‚Äôt know, who was in the circle. Now you‚Äôre seeing the very edge of the meditation circle‚Ä¶. Grant Cameron‚Ä¶¬†¬†was there with me‚Ä¶. So, my chair is on the other side of Grant.‚Ä¶.**And there‚Äôs a little being right there. And here‚Äôs the bright light coming out of my chest with these kinds of tendrils of light as well‚Ä¶**¬†

**A**nd then here‚Äôs a really super-duper close-up version of the little being‚Ä¶

**Jeff Mara:**¬†Would you say that that being is standing right next to your chair?

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†Yes, yeah and I felt it there, you know, even during that experience‚Ä¶ I was feeling them to my left ‚Ä¶ You can see where my body is‚Ä¶ and here‚Äôs the little being‚Äôs shoulder and there‚Äôs the neck, it‚Äôs head‚Ä¶ the eye.. and there are other beings in the photograph as well.¬†  
  
Understandably because of the photograph that Sin√©ad presented, there has been considerable public interest in this Jeff Mara podcast. In just a few weeks, over 60,000 views of this interview had been tallied. In my opinion, however, Sin√©ad Whelehan‚Äôs personal story as described in this in-depth interview is of even greater significance than the photographic evidence she obtained. Sin√©ad‚Äôs¬†¬†journey into contact has involved her overcoming many personal challenges. Perhaps the most important one is the fact that she is nearly totally deaf and has required two major surgeries for cochlear implants.¬†

[Sin√©ad Whelehan has experienced multiple Contact Modalities](https://preview.redd.it/7bigruhbba9e1.jpg?width=164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=749e37dbede980da5dbeb13c3ebd6918ef8bfb3b)

**The Making of a Contact Activist**

In July of 2019, Sin√©ad experienced what she describes as a ‚Äúmassive awakening.‚Äù She explained the term ‚Äúawakening‚Äù might not be the best term to use because for decades she previously had engaged in spiritual practices like meditation and yoga. Nonetheless, what happened to her in 2019 was likened to ‚Äúbeing bonged on the head with the cosmic frying pan‚Ä¶‚Äù It happened as she was recovering from her second cochlear implant.¬†

Sin√©ad suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence in her room of multiple non-human entities who communicated with her telepathically. According to Sin√©ad, the beings were saying, ‚ÄúOK. It‚Äôs time! We‚Äôve been with you all along. It‚Äôs now time. You have a job to do!‚Äù¬†¬†¬†And her mission was to spread the word that every one of us are cosmic beings. And we need to recognize our long-standing relationship with ‚Äúthe extraterrestrials.‚Äù This new sense of duty, however, was not without a downside.¬†

For two decades Sin√©ad had a very responsible position as a public-school teacher in Canada. She worked in special education for elementary and high school students. Her profession gave her an opportunity to work with children, something she has always loved doing. In addition, her position provided her with a good income, job security and benefits. She found herself in a dilemma, how could she change her life in ways that were consistent with the radical paradigm shift that she was undergoing?¬†  
  
**In the following section of this report, Sin√©ad Whelehan reveals one of the most astounding contact events that I have ever come across.**¬†In my judgment, this vignette is an example of how UFO intelligences can manipulate spacetime. Sin√©ad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.)¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that feeling that experiencers often talk about. I just knew that it was ETs.¬†¬†I knew what they were telling me was real.¬†¬†And believe me, I had moments of doubting myself. Then, I would ask them for validation, and they would give me ridiculous validation that was absolutely undeniable.¬†¬†

An example is that I‚Äôm a teacher.¬†¬†This happened in the summer (of 2019). I had my ‚Äúawakening‚Äù in July and about two weeks after the ‚Äúbig cosmic frying pan experience‚Äù happened. I had already been hired months before to mark government literacy tests. There are these booklets that are sent out to kids all over the country. In Canada they were sent out to kids in grade 6 to test their math and their literacy (skills).¬†

So, I was hired to mark these booklets and score them. (This project was) to track the data for kids all over the country in terms of their literacy levels. This job was done in a massive warehouse. And there I was with all these tired teachers, you know, trudging in with big jugs of coffee. They were chugging down their coffee through the day and marking these booklets. It was just such dry work and in this big, huge empty warehouse. And, you know, we got cattle called back after breaks. It felt like such a massive juxtaposition to the vibration that I had experienced (with the ETs) just a short while before that I started to feel like,‚Äù Oh my God, I have gone crazy.‚Äù¬†

So, I started getting worried about myself.¬†¬†I went home one day‚Ä¶ and I was very upset.¬†¬†I just started talking to them (the ETs) out loud. I‚Äôm not someone who grew up religious‚Ä¶ I never prayed in my life, but I just started talking to them. I was sitting on the floor of my living room crying a little bit, really, really distressed, and stressed out. (I was) wondering if I was mentally well. I asked them, if this (the continuous presence of ET beings in her life) is really true, ‚ÄúI need you to prove it to me. I need you to prove it to me in a way that is undeniable and unmistakable‚Ä¶.‚Äù

So, then I felt this very warm soothing presence around me, and I relaxed. I felt better and I went to bed.¬†¬†Woke up the next day, drove to work. It started as usual‚Ä¶ (What) we‚Äôre supposed to do is just walk up to the front of the room where there‚Äôs this massive floor to ceiling shelf. I grab a random stack of booklets, bring them back to our desk and start marking them‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre supposed to mark exactly the same question over and over again. So, each (student)answers the question differently.¬†¬†They are 10-11 years old. They‚Äôre in grade 6 and supposed to be writing about ‚Äúthe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù It‚Äôs a creative writing challenge for them.

**Astounding High Strangeness Event**

On that day, for 45 minutes, from 9:00 o‚Äôclock until 9:45 every single booklet I opened had compositions about, ET s, UFOs, flying cars, free energy, portals, ‚Äúthe earth is alive‚Äù, ‚Äúthe Galaxy is full of other beings‚Äù (What) I was reading ‚Ä¶ has nothing to do with the original prompt ‚ÄúThe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù Nothing to do with it! Here are these kids writing in pencil in 10- to 11-year-old child‚Äôs writing, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a portal in my bedroom‚Äù, ‚ÄúI designed time travel‚Äù, ‚ÄúI made a time machine‚Äù, ‚Äúthe earth is alive and conscious; she knows what we‚Äôre all doing to her‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere are spaceships out there.‚Äù I mean I just couldn‚Äôt believe it. I could not believe it!

We were not allowed to take breaks that early in the morning, but I just said, ‚ÄúI have to‚Äù‚Ä¶ I went to the washroom. I texted a bunch of friends of mine who I had met by that point in the community because immediately after my awakening I just started reaching out to people for help. I needed to understand what was going on. I connected with the lovely Kosta Makreas (who was recently interviewed on the Jeff Mara Podcast). Kosta was immediately there for me, to support me. I texted him and a couple of other people he had introduced me to‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI need you to tell me if this is real. Did this really just happen?‚Äù Meanwhile the hairs on the skin of my arms are standing straight up.¬†¬†

(There I am) in a stall in the bathroom furiously typing.¬†¬†They all wrote me back and said, ‚ÄúYep this is what happens.‚Äù You know, this is exactly it! I mean how can you deny that is validation! Not to mention, when I came back from the bathroom, the rest of the booklets that were on my desk, I think there were three or four left, none of them had anything to do with it (the flying saucer/paranormal themes). It was all back to the question (and for the rest of the day it was the original composition prompt question) ‚ÄúHow I Became Famous‚Äù (The answers were what one might expect from 6^(th)¬†graders, things like) ‚Äúbecause of YouTube.‚Äù¬†

**Discussion:**

**How were**¬†the non-human intelligences that contacted Sin√©ad able to stage such an extremely strange sequence of events? She asked for a clear sign that her contacts and communications were real and not the result of her being mentally imbalanced. The very next day the compositions written by 6^(th)¬†graders deviated from the assignment. Instead of writing ‚ÄúThe Day I Became Famous‚Äù, they wrote about numerous themes associated with ‚ÄúET contact.‚Äù¬†¬†

For two decades I have promoted what I call the Virtual Experience Model for flying saucer investigations. This theory outlines what I believe are consciousness-based/‚Äúillusory‚Äù mechanisms of contact employed by UFO intelligences during interactions with people targeted for encounters. According to this proposed model, a Virtual Experience of the Third Kind (VE-3) is a false memory inserted into the consciousness of a contact experiencers by flying saucer intelligences. These ‚Äúthought forms‚Äù might be so skillfully done that the false memories convince the experiencer that they represent recollections of actual events. Could Sin√©ad ‚Äôs recollection of this ‚ÄúHigh Strangeness‚Äù be a false memory, a VE-3?

This is not a reasonable explanation because immediately after being confronted with the High Strangeness of children writing about what are called ‚Äúanomalous phenomena‚Äù, she texted fellow contact activist Kosta Makreas. I spoke to him the day after I viewed the interview. Kosta recalled receiving the message from Sin√©ad and reassuring her with a reply akin to ‚ÄúYep this is what happens.‚Äù

For decades, renowned UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee has pointed out that the intelligences responsible for UFOs appear to be able to manipulate spacetime. In my opinion, a consensus is beginning to emerge among contact experiencers as well as UFO investigators that the High Strangeness events associated with UFOs are showing us that materialist science‚Äôs explanations as to the nature of reality are at best incomplete. If consciousness, and not mass/energy is the wellspring of creation, then the fundamental assumptions of academic mainstream science are plainly wrong.¬†

**Conclusion**

If consciousness is primary, then perhaps our 4-D reality of spacetime is a kind of projection from some more fundamental realm that is pure consciousness. There has been much speculation in scientific circles that the Cosmos, and everything in it, is part of some simulation created by advanced intelligences. If this is true, then the alleged ETs might be able to enter our ‚Äúreality‚Äù at will and alter the simulation, thereby staging the ‚Äúinexplicable‚Äù events that we label ‚ÄúHigh Strangeness.‚Äù Sin√©ad ‚Äôs encountering a stack of ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù handwritten 6^(th)¬†grade compositions could very well be an example of a personal simulation being altered by her ‚Äúfriends in high places.‚Äù¬†¬†

Akro Bake ‚Äî> Love. I got a decant over a year ago and wanted it ever since. Opens with a fairly tart lemon and transitions into a softer vanilla. It‚Äôs a gorgeous gourmand that I think you could get away with in the summer but I do wish the lemon stuck around longer with better projection. The longevity is average.

Indult Tihota ‚Äî> insane vanilla. extremely powerful sillage. I gave it one spritz yesterday and the entire room smelled like a vanilla bomb went off for about an hour. It‚Äôs fairly linear but overall a very rich vanilla. The longevity is also insane for me. 

French Coffee by Al Rehab ‚Äî> I smell the coffee but it has an extremely synthetic & plastic-y scent that persists. It‚Äôs very cheap so maybe that should be expected? I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs something off with my bottle or maybe it‚Äôs my skin chemistry I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôll give it another chance but may end up giving to a friend that likes it. 

Coffee Addict by Theodoros Kalotinis ‚Äî> gorgeous photorealistic coffee. I pick up on some vanilla, caramel, & slight spice but it‚Äôs very minimal. The coffee/espresso is 100% the star of the show. It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for. I love it. It has a pretty strong sillage (my cousin smelled it from a few feet away after only 1 spritz). The longevity is also good. 

Vanilla Musk by Nemat ‚Äî> I‚Äôve had several of the fragrance oils but finally got the perfume and it‚Äôs a great vanilla (especially for the price). It smells nearly identical to the oil but the perfume isn‚Äôt as rich. Either way it‚Äôs a great vanilla. To be honest, it smells similar to Tihota (just not nearly as strong or rich) so it‚Äôs a little redundant. I think I‚Äôll reach for this one on a more casual basis so that I don‚Äôt use up all 50 mL of Tihota super fast. The projection is pretty weak & longevity could be better but it‚Äôs a solid vanilla and I‚Äôm totally okay with everyone around me not smelling me 24/7. 

Akro Glow ‚Äî> Unfortunately I can‚Äôt give a full review yet but may update with my thoughts later. 

Side note: I love them but wow I rlly need to cut back on the perfume obsession. As someone who thrifts for most of my clothes, this type of overconsumption makes me feel extremely guilty. I‚Äôm super happy with all of my new additions (except French coffee) but I definitely want to use up some of my bottles before purchasing more. I‚Äôm starting to feel very guilty knowing I won‚Äôt be able to finish them all. Something about fragrances is just so addictive unfortunately :(",2,1735258775.0,Perfumes,2,1.0,False

Sin√©ad Whelehan's ""Alien"" Photo, ""Awakening"" & the Manipulation of Spacetime

","**Contact activist¬†Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan obtained a photo of an ‚ÄúET‚Äù while participating in a CE-5.¬†Her story reveals not only the power of contact to transform a person‚Äôs world view but also provides a dramatic example of how UFO intelligences manipulate spacetime.**

**Joseph Burkes MD 2023**

**Introduction**

Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan is a contact activist that I met in November of 2021 when she produced an online video interview with me for the¬†**‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù website**. At that time, she had been working with researcher/author Grant Cameron for two years gaining experience as a researcher and interviewer. According to her brief bio on the ‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù webpage Sin√©ad¬†is a lifelong experiencer of multiple forms of paranormal high strangeness ‚Äúas well as being a lifelong spiritual practitioner.‚Äù¬†

I subscribe to Jeff Mara‚Äôs Podcast and when I saw her picture appear as a guest on his YouTube channel, I wanted to hear what she had to say. My curiosity was piqued when I read the provocative title of the program ‚Äú**Alien Stands Next To Her AT CE-5 Event ‚Äì ALIEN PHOTO.‚Äù**¬†

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s)

The event that she describes in which a small ‚Äúalien‚Äù being is photographed next to her during CE-5 fieldwork reminded me of an encounter that I had with my contact team one night in the Santa Monica Mountains in 1993.

**High Strangeness in Malibu Canyon**  
  
For five years back in the 1990s, I was a contact team leader for the CE-5 Initiative. Our group staged repeated Human Initiated Contact Events (HICE) in Southern California. During one outing the team was operating high up overlooking Malibu Canyon. While in deep meditation, I felt a strong pleasant pressure sensation in the middle of my chest. In retrospect, I imagine that my heart chakra was opening wide, because I was filled with a powerful peaceful loving feeling. After the meditation was over, my teammate, United Airlines Captain Joe Vallejo, told me the following:¬†

He stated that at one point during the meditation he had slightly opened his eyes. There, standing directly in front of me, was a small ‚Äúboxy‚Äù non-human being. Its rectangular form was only about two feet high, and it stood motionlessly less than twelve inches away from me. He reported that when he opened his eyes wide to get a better look, the rectangular form disappeared.¬†

**Sin√©ad ‚Äôs Photograph Obtained During Volunteer Contact Work**

During the last 20 minutes of Jeff Mara‚Äôs interview, Sin√©ad showed the photograph mentioned in the title of the program.¬†The digital picture was taken during an Illinois CE-5 nighttime outing in 2021. According to Sin√©ad, it was light blasted to bring out the details not easily seen because the picture was taken at night.¬†**Aside from the light blasting, no other alterations of the photograph were reportedly made.**¬†Sin√©ad gives her description of the photograph during the interview as follows:

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†This is a random photograph that was taken by a woman I didn‚Äôt know, who was in the circle. Now you‚Äôre seeing the very edge of the meditation circle‚Ä¶. Grant Cameron‚Ä¶¬†¬†was there with me‚Ä¶. So, my chair is on the other side of Grant.‚Ä¶.**And there‚Äôs a little being right there. And here‚Äôs the bright light coming out of my chest with these kinds of tendrils of light as well‚Ä¶**¬†

**A**nd then here‚Äôs a really super-duper close-up version of the little being‚Ä¶

**Jeff Mara:**¬†Would you say that that being is standing right next to your chair?

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†Yes, yeah and I felt it there, you know, even during that experience‚Ä¶ I was feeling them to my left ‚Ä¶ You can see where my body is‚Ä¶ and here‚Äôs the little being‚Äôs shoulder and there‚Äôs the neck, it‚Äôs head‚Ä¶ the eye.. and there are other beings in the photograph as well.¬†  
  
Understandably because of the photograph that Sin√©ad presented, there has been considerable public interest in this Jeff Mara podcast. In just a few weeks, over 60,000 views of this interview had been tallied. In my opinion, however, Sin√©ad Whelehan‚Äôs personal story as described in this in-depth interview is of even greater significance than the photographic evidence she obtained. Sin√©ad‚Äôs¬†¬†journey into contact has involved her overcoming many personal challenges. Perhaps the most important one is the fact that she is nearly totally deaf and has required two major surgeries for cochlear implants.¬†

**The Making of a Contact Activist**

In July of 2019, Sin√©ad experienced what she describes as a ‚Äúmassive awakening.‚Äù She explained the term ‚Äúawakening‚Äù might not be the best term to use because for decades she previously had engaged in spiritual practices like meditation and yoga. Nonetheless, what happened to her in 2019 was likened to ‚Äúbeing bonged on the head with the cosmic frying pan‚Ä¶‚Äù It happened as she was recovering from her second cochlear implant.¬†

Sin√©ad suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence in her room of multiple non-human entities who communicated with her telepathically. According to Sin√©ad, the beings were saying, ‚ÄúOK. It‚Äôs time! We‚Äôve been with you all along. It‚Äôs now time. You have a job to do!‚Äù¬†¬†¬†And her mission was to spread the word that every one of us are cosmic beings. And we need to recognize our long-standing relationship with ‚Äúthe extraterrestrials.‚Äù This new sense of duty, however, was not without a downside.¬†

For two decades Sin√©ad had a very responsible position as a public-school teacher in Canada. She worked in special education for elementary and high school students. Her profession gave her an opportunity to work with children, something she has always loved doing. In addition, her position provided her with a good income, job security and benefits. She found herself in a dilemma, how could she change her life in ways that were consistent with the radical paradigm shift that she was undergoing?¬†  
  
**In the following section of this report, Sin√©ad Whelehan reveals one of the most astounding contact events that I have ever come across.**¬†In my judgment, this vignette is an example of how UFO intelligences can manipulate spacetime. Sin√©ad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.)¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that feeling that experiencers often talk about. I just knew that it was ETs.¬†¬†I knew what they were telling me was real.¬†¬†And believe me, I had moments of doubting myself. Then, I would ask them for validation, and they would give me ridiculous validation that was absolutely undeniable.¬†¬†

An example is that I‚Äôm a teacher.¬†¬†This happened in the summer (of 2019). I had my ‚Äúawakening‚Äù in July and about two weeks after the ‚Äúbig cosmic frying pan experience‚Äù happened. I had already been hired months before to mark government literacy tests. There are these booklets that are sent out to kids all over the country. In Canada they were sent out to kids in grade 6 to test their math and their literacy (skills).¬†

So, I was hired to mark these booklets and score them. (This project was) to track the data for kids all over the country in terms of their literacy levels. This job was done in a massive warehouse. And there I was with all these tired teachers, you know, trudging in with big jugs of coffee. They were chugging down their coffee through the day and marking these booklets. It was just such dry work and in this big, huge empty warehouse. And, you know, we got cattle called back after breaks. It felt like such a massive juxtaposition to the vibration that I had experienced (with the ETs) just a short while before that I started to feel like,‚Äù Oh my God, I have gone crazy.‚Äù¬†

So, I started getting worried about myself.¬†¬†I went home one day‚Ä¶ and I was very upset.¬†¬†I just started talking to them (the ETs) out loud. I‚Äôm not someone who grew up religious‚Ä¶ I never prayed in my life, but I just started talking to them. I was sitting on the floor of my living room crying a little bit, really, really distressed, and stressed out. (I was) wondering if I was mentally well. I asked them, if this (the continuous presence of ET beings in her life) is really true, ‚ÄúI need you to prove it to me. I need you to prove it to me in a way that is undeniable and unmistakable‚Ä¶.‚Äù

So, then I felt this very warm soothing presence around me, and I relaxed. I felt better and I went to bed.¬†¬†Woke up the next day, drove to work. It started as usual‚Ä¶ (What) we‚Äôre supposed to do is just walk up to the front of the room where there‚Äôs this massive floor to ceiling shelf. I grab a random stack of booklets, bring them back to our desk and start marking them‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre supposed to mark exactly the same question over and over again. So, each (student)answers the question differently.¬†¬†They are 10-11 years old. They‚Äôre in grade 6 and supposed to be writing about ‚Äúthe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù It‚Äôs a creative writing challenge for them.

I could not believe it!

We were not allowed to take breaks that early in the morning, but I just said, ‚ÄúI have to‚Äù‚Ä¶ I went to the washroom.

A good example is the smarmy boss from ""office space"".

I'm wondering if anyone else feels this, and why i feel this? I wonder if it's some sort of innate fear of weaponry: like humans see someone holding something, and we associate it with a sword or club or something... It's specially mugs... I don't feel irritated if people are holding other things (boxes, phones, penguins etc). So the handle of the mug is maybe like a sword?

If the person has two hands on the mug with their fingers interlaced: that's fine. It's specifically if they're holding the handle of the mug. If they're holding with two hands i think i infer they're vulnerable, and clutching it for comfort or warmth.

Maybe more likely is im associating it with negative memories: i guess my mum used to hold mugs of coffee alot? (Fyi some childhood trauma in that area but we still love each other and talk a few times a week...aaaanyway...). The feeling is the same for men and women though. And i feel it's only developed in the last five years or so (im 45)

If i was to explain the feeling, it's like i infer that the person is arrogant, smug, or slightly aggressive. Or they're going to be defensive and harder for me to get through to... 

Anyway aside from an intense deep dive in to my psyche, curious if anyone else experienced this or had thoughts on it :)",1,1735258463.0,NoStupidQuestions,7,1.0,False

Sin√©ad Whelehan's ""Alien"" Photo, ""Awakening"" & the Manipulation of Spacetime

¬†

**Contact activist¬†Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan obtained a photo of an ‚ÄúET‚Äù while participating in a CE-5.¬†Her story reveals not only the power of contact to transform a person‚Äôs world view but also provides a dramatic example of how UFO intelligences manipulate spacetime.**

**Joseph Burkes MD 2023**

**Introduction**

Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan is a contact activist that I met in November of 2021 when she produced an online video interview with me for the¬†**‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù website**. At that time, she had been working with researcher/author Grant Cameron for two years gaining experience as a researcher and interviewer. According to her brief bio on the ‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù webpage Sin√©ad¬†is a lifelong experiencer of multiple forms of paranormal high strangeness ‚Äúas well as being a lifelong spiritual practitioner.‚Äù¬†

I subscribe to Jeff Mara‚Äôs Podcast and when I saw her picture appear as a guest on his YouTube channel, I wanted to hear what she had to say. My curiosity was piqued when I read the provocative title of the program ‚Äú**Alien Stands Next To Her AT CE-5 Event ‚Äì ALIEN PHOTO.‚Äù**¬†

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s)

The event that she describes in which a small ‚Äúalien‚Äù being is photographed next to her during CE-5 fieldwork reminded me of an encounter that I had with my contact team one night in the Santa Monica Mountains in 1993.

**High Strangeness in Malibu Canyon**  
  
For five years back in the 1990s, I was a contact team leader for the CE-5 Initiative. Our group staged repeated Human Initiated Contact Events (HICE) in Southern California. During one outing the team was operating high up overlooking Malibu Canyon. While in deep meditation, I felt a strong pleasant pressure sensation in the middle of my chest. In retrospect, I imagine that my heart chakra was opening wide, because I was filled with a powerful peaceful loving feeling. After the meditation was over, my teammate, United Airlines Captain Joe Vallejo, told me the following:¬†

He stated that at one point during the meditation he had slightly opened his eyes. There, standing directly in front of me, was a small ‚Äúboxy‚Äù non-human being. Its rectangular form was only about two feet high, and it stood motionlessly less than twelve inches away from me. He reported that when he opened his eyes wide to get a better look, the rectangular form disappeared.¬†

**Sin√©ad ‚Äôs Photograph Obtained During Volunteer Contact Work**

During the last 20 minutes of Jeff Mara‚Äôs interview, Sin√©ad showed the photograph mentioned in the title of the program.¬†The digital picture was taken during an Illinois CE-5 nighttime outing in 2021. According to Sin√©ad, it was light blasted to bring out the details not easily seen because the picture was taken at night.¬†**Aside from the light blasting, no other alterations of the photograph were reportedly made.**¬†Sin√©ad gives her description of the photograph during the interview as follows:

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†This is a random photograph that was taken by a woman I didn‚Äôt know, who was in the circle. Now you‚Äôre seeing the very edge of the meditation circle‚Ä¶. Grant Cameron‚Ä¶¬†¬†was there with me‚Ä¶. So, my chair is on the other side of Grant.‚Ä¶.**And there‚Äôs a little being right there. And here‚Äôs the bright light coming out of my chest with these kinds of tendrils of light as well‚Ä¶**¬†

**A**nd then here‚Äôs a really super-duper close-up version of the little being‚Ä¶

**Jeff Mara:**¬†Would you say that that being is standing right next to your chair?

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†Yes, yeah and I felt it there, you know, even during that experience‚Ä¶ I was feeling them to my left ‚Ä¶ You can see where my body is‚Ä¶ and here‚Äôs the little being‚Äôs shoulder and there‚Äôs the neck, it‚Äôs head‚Ä¶ the eye.. and there are other beings in the photograph as well.¬†  
  
Understandably because of the photograph that Sin√©ad presented, there has been considerable public interest in this Jeff Mara podcast. In just a few weeks, over 60,000 views of this interview had been tallied. In my opinion, however, Sin√©ad Whelehan‚Äôs personal story as described in this in-depth interview is of even greater significance than the photographic evidence she obtained. Sin√©ad‚Äôs¬†¬†journey into contact has involved her overcoming many personal challenges. Perhaps the most important one is the fact that she is nearly totally deaf and has required two major surgeries for cochlear implants.¬†

**The Making of a Contact Activist**

In July of 2019, Sin√©ad experienced what she describes as a ‚Äúmassive awakening.‚Äù She explained the term ‚Äúawakening‚Äù might not be the best term to use because for decades she previously had engaged in spiritual practices like meditation and yoga. Nonetheless, what happened to her in 2019 was likened to ‚Äúbeing bonged on the head with the cosmic frying pan‚Ä¶‚Äù It happened as she was recovering from her second cochlear implant.¬†

Sin√©ad suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence in her room of multiple non-human entities who communicated with her telepathically. According to Sin√©ad, the beings were saying, ‚ÄúOK. It‚Äôs time! We‚Äôve been with you all along. It‚Äôs now time. You have a job to do!‚Äù¬†¬†¬†And her mission was to spread the word that every one of us are cosmic beings. And we need to recognize our long-standing relationship with ‚Äúthe extraterrestrials.‚Äù This new sense of duty, however, was not without a downside.¬†

For two decades Sin√©ad had a very responsible position as a public-school teacher in Canada. She worked in special education for elementary and high school students. Her profession gave her an opportunity to work with children, something she has always loved doing. In addition, her position provided her with a good income, job security and benefits. She found herself in a dilemma, how could she change her life in ways that were consistent with the radical paradigm shift that she was undergoing?¬†  
  
**In the following section of this report, Sin√©ad Whelehan reveals one of the most astounding contact events that I have ever come across.**¬†In my judgment, this vignette is an example of how UFO intelligences can manipulate spacetime. Sin√©ad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.)¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that feeling that experiencers often talk about. I just knew that it was ETs.¬†¬†I knew what they were telling me was real.¬†¬†And believe me, I had moments of doubting myself. Then, I would ask them for validation, and they would give me ridiculous validation that was absolutely undeniable.¬†¬†

An example is that I‚Äôm a teacher.¬†¬†This happened in the summer (of 2019). I had my ‚Äúawakening‚Äù in July and about two weeks after the ‚Äúbig cosmic frying pan experience‚Äù happened. I had already been hired months before to mark government literacy tests. There are these booklets that are sent out to kids all over the country. In Canada they were sent out to kids in grade 6 to test their math and their literacy (skills).¬†

So, I was hired to mark these booklets and score them. (This project was) to track the data for kids all over the country in terms of their literacy levels. This job was done in a massive warehouse. And there I was with all these tired teachers, you know, trudging in with big jugs of coffee. They were chugging down their coffee through the day and marking these booklets. It was just such dry work and in this big, huge empty warehouse. And, you know, we got cattle called back after breaks. It felt like such a massive juxtaposition to the vibration that I had experienced (with the ETs) just a short while before that I started to feel like,‚Äù Oh my God, I have gone crazy.‚Äù¬†

So, I started getting worried about myself.¬†¬†I went home one day‚Ä¶ and I was very upset.¬†¬†I just started talking to them (the ETs) out loud. I‚Äôm not someone who grew up religious‚Ä¶ I never prayed in my life, but I just started talking to them. I was sitting on the floor of my living room crying a little bit, really, really distressed, and stressed out. (I was) wondering if I was mentally well. I asked them, if this (the continuous presence of ET beings in her life) is really true, ‚ÄúI need you to prove it to me. I need you to prove it to me in a way that is undeniable and unmistakable‚Ä¶.‚Äù

So, then I felt this very warm soothing presence around me, and I relaxed. I felt better and I went to bed.¬†¬†Woke up the next day, drove to work. It started as usual‚Ä¶ (What) we‚Äôre supposed to do is just walk up to the front of the room where there‚Äôs this massive floor to ceiling shelf. I grab a random stack of booklets, bring them back to our desk and start marking them‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre supposed to mark exactly the same question over and over again. So, each (student)answers the question differently.¬†¬†They are 10-11 years old. They‚Äôre in grade 6 and supposed to be writing about ‚Äúthe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù It‚Äôs a creative writing challenge for them.

**Astounding High Strangeness Event**

On that day, for 45 minutes, from 9:00 o‚Äôclock until 9:45 every single booklet I opened had compositions about, ET s, UFOs, flying cars, free energy, portals, ‚Äúthe earth is alive‚Äù, ‚Äúthe Galaxy is full of other beings‚Äù (What) I was reading ‚Ä¶ has nothing to do with the original prompt ‚ÄúThe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù Nothing to do with it! Here are these kids writing in pencil in 10- to 11-year-old child‚Äôs writing, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a portal in my bedroom‚Äù, ‚ÄúI designed time travel‚Äù, ‚ÄúI made a time machine‚Äù, ‚Äúthe earth is alive and conscious; she knows what we‚Äôre all doing to her‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere are spaceships out there.‚Äù I mean I just couldn‚Äôt believe it. I could not believe it!

We were not allowed to take breaks that early in the morning, but I just said, ‚ÄúI have to‚Äù‚Ä¶ I went to the washroom. I texted a bunch of friends of mine who I had met by that point in the community because immediately after my awakening I just started reaching out to people for help. I needed to understand what was going on. I connected with the lovely Kosta Makreas (who was recently interviewed on the Jeff Mara Podcast). Kosta was immediately there for me, to support me. I texted him and a couple of other people he had introduced me to‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI need you to tell me if this is real. Did this really just happen?‚Äù Meanwhile the hairs on the skin of my arms are standing straight up.¬†¬†

(There I am) in a stall in the bathroom furiously typing.¬†¬†They all wrote me back and said, ‚ÄúYep this is what happens.‚Äù You know, this is exactly it! I mean how can you deny that is validation! Not to mention, when I came back from the bathroom, the rest of the booklets that were on my desk, I think there were three or four left, none of them had anything to do with it (the flying saucer/paranormal themes). It was all back to the question (and for the rest of the day it was the original composition prompt question) ‚ÄúHow I Became Famous‚Äù (The answers were what one might expect from 6^(th)¬†graders, things like) ‚Äúbecause of YouTube.‚Äù¬†

**Discussion:**

**How were**¬†the non-human intelligences that contacted Sin√©ad able to stage such an extremely strange sequence of events? She asked for a clear sign that her contacts and communications were real and not the result of her being mentally imbalanced. The very next day the compositions written by 6^(th)¬†graders deviated from the assignment. Instead of writing ‚ÄúThe Day I Became Famous‚Äù, they wrote about numerous themes associated with ‚ÄúET contact.‚Äù¬†¬†

For two decades I have promoted what I call the Virtual Experience Model for flying saucer investigations. This theory outlines what I believe are consciousness-based/‚Äúillusory‚Äù mechanisms of contact employed by UFO intelligences during interactions with people targeted for encounters. According to this proposed model, a Virtual Experience of the Third Kind (VE-3) is a false memory inserted into the consciousness of a contact experiencers by flying saucer intelligences. These ‚Äúthought forms‚Äù might be so skillfully done that the false memories convince the experiencer that they represent recollections of actual events. Could Sin√©ad ‚Äôs recollection of this ‚ÄúHigh Strangeness‚Äù be a false memory, a VE-3?

This is not a reasonable explanation because immediately after being confronted with the High Strangeness of children writing about what are called ‚Äúanomalous phenomena‚Äù, she texted fellow contact activist Kosta Makreas. I spoke to him the day after I viewed the interview. Kosta recalled receiving the message from Sin√©ad and reassuring her with a reply akin to ‚ÄúYep this is what happens.‚Äù

For decades, renowned UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee has pointed out that the intelligences responsible for UFOs appear to be able to manipulate spacetime. In my opinion, a consensus is beginning to emerge among contact experiencers as well as UFO investigators that the High Strangeness events associated with UFOs are showing us that materialist science‚Äôs explanations as to the nature of reality are at best incomplete. If consciousness, and not mass/energy is the wellspring of creation, then the fundamental assumptions of academic mainstream science are plainly wrong.¬†

**Conclusion**

If consciousness is primary, then perhaps our 4-D reality of spacetime is a kind of projection from some more fundamental realm that is pure consciousness. There has been much speculation in scientific circles that the Cosmos, and everything in it, is part of some simulation created by advanced intelligences. If this is true, then the alleged ETs might be able to enter our ‚Äúreality‚Äù at will and alter the simulation, thereby staging the ‚Äúinexplicable‚Äù events that we label ‚ÄúHigh Strangeness.‚Äù Sin√©ad ‚Äôs encountering a stack of ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù handwritten 6^(th)¬†grade compositions could very well be an example of a personal simulation being altered by her ‚Äúfriends in high places.‚Äù¬†¬†

**Upon return from a CE-5 mission to the Volcanic Zone where we witnessed a large silent triangular shaped craft, I experienced several High Strangeness events. These included a sighting of a 100-foot UFO over US-10. While carrying out contact protocols with my team in the Santa Monica Mountains, I heard an anomalous sound track through our research site.**¬†

Sin√©ad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.)¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that feeling that experiencers often talk about. I just knew that it was ETs.¬†¬†I knew what they were telling me was real.¬†¬†And believe me, I had moments of doubting myself. Then, I would ask them for validation, and they would give me ridiculous validation that was absolutely undeniable.¬†¬†

An example is that I‚Äôm a teacher.¬†¬†This happened in the summer (of 2019). I had my ‚Äúawakening‚Äù in July and about two weeks after the ‚Äúbig cosmic frying pan experience‚Äù happened. I had already been hired months before to mark government literacy tests. There are these booklets that are sent out to kids all over the country. In Canada they were sent out to kids in grade 6 to test their math and their literacy (skills).¬†

So, I was hired to mark these booklets and score them. (This project was) to track the data for kids all over the country in terms of their literacy levels. This job was done in a massive warehouse. And there I was with all these tired teachers, you know, trudging in with big jugs of coffee. They were chugging down their coffee through the day and marking these booklets. It was just such dry work and in this big, huge empty warehouse. And, you know, we got cattle called back after breaks. It felt like such a massive juxtaposition to the vibration that I had experienced (with the ETs) just a short while before that I started to feel like,‚Äù Oh my God, I have gone crazy.‚Äù¬†

So, I started getting worried about myself.¬†¬†I went home one day‚Ä¶ and I was very upset.¬†¬†I just started talking to them (the ETs) out loud. I‚Äôm not someone who grew up religious‚Ä¶ I never prayed in my life, but I just started talking to them. I was sitting on the floor of my living room crying a little bit, really, really distressed, and stressed out. (I was) wondering if I was mentally well. I asked them, if this (the continuous presence of ET beings in her life) is really true, ‚ÄúI need you to prove it to me. I need you to prove it to me in a way that is undeniable and unmistakable‚Ä¶.‚Äù

So, then I felt this very warm soothing presence around me, and I relaxed. I felt better and I went to bed.¬†¬†Woke up the next day, drove to work. It started as usual‚Ä¶ (What) we‚Äôre supposed to do is just walk up to the front of the room where there‚Äôs this massive floor to ceiling shelf. I grab a random stack of booklets, bring them back to our desk and start marking them‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre supposed to mark exactly the same question over and over again. So, each (student)answers the question differently.¬†¬†They are 10-11 years old. They‚Äôre in grade 6 and supposed to be writing about ‚Äúthe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù It‚Äôs a creative writing challenge for them.

**Astounding High Strangeness Event**

On that day, for 45 minutes, from 9:00 o‚Äôclock until 9:45 every single booklet I opened had compositions about, ET s, UFOs, flying cars, free energy, portals, ‚Äúthe earth is alive‚Äù, ‚Äúthe Galaxy is full of other beings‚Äù (What) I was reading ‚Ä¶ has nothing to do with the original prompt ‚ÄúThe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù Nothing to do with it! Here are these kids writing in pencil in 10- to 11-year-old child‚Äôs writing, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a portal in my bedroom‚Äù, ‚ÄúI designed time travel‚Äù, ‚ÄúI made a time machine‚Äù, ‚Äúthe earth is alive and conscious; she knows what we‚Äôre all doing to her‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere are spaceships out there.‚Äù I mean I just couldn‚Äôt believe it. I could not believe it!

We were not allowed to take breaks that early in the morning, but I just said, ‚ÄúI have to‚Äù‚Ä¶ I went to the washroom. I texted a bunch of friends of mine who I had met by that point in the community because immediately after my awakening I just started reaching out to people for help. I needed to understand what was going on. I connected with the lovely Kosta Makreas (who was recently interviewed on the Jeff Mara Podcast). Kosta was immediately there for me, to support me. I texted him and a couple of other people he had introduced me to‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI need you to tell me if this is real. Did this really just happen?‚Äù Meanwhile the hairs on the skin of my arms are standing straight up.¬†¬†

(There I am) in a stall in the bathroom furiously typing.¬†¬†They all wrote me back and said, ‚ÄúYep this is what happens.‚Äù You know, this is exactly it! I mean how can you deny that is validation! Not to mention, when I came back from the bathroom, the rest of the booklets that were on my desk, I think there were three or four left, none of them had anything to do with it (the flying saucer/paranormal themes). It was all back to the question (and for the rest of the day it was the original composition prompt question) ‚ÄúHow I Became Famous‚Äù (The answers were what one might expect from 6^(th)¬†graders, things like) ‚Äúbecause of YouTube.‚Äù¬†

**Discussion:**

**How were**¬†the non-human intelligences that contacted Sin√©ad able to stage such an extremely strange sequence of events? She asked for a clear sign that her contacts and communications were real and not the result of her being mentally imbalanced. The very next day the compositions written by 6^(th)¬†graders deviated from the assignment. Instead of writing ‚ÄúThe Day I Became Famous‚Äù, they wrote about numerous themes associated with ‚ÄúET contact.‚Äù¬†¬†

For two decades I have promoted what I call the Virtual Experience Model for flying saucer investigations. This theory outlines what I believe are consciousness-based/‚Äúillusory‚Äù mechanisms of contact employed by UFO intelligences during interactions with people targeted for encounters. According to this proposed model, a Virtual Experience of the Third Kind (VE-3) is a false memory inserted into the consciousness of a contact experiencers by flying saucer intelligences. These ‚Äúthought forms‚Äù might be so skillfully done that the false memories convince the experiencer that they represent recollections of actual events. Could Sin√©ad ‚Äôs recollection of this ‚ÄúHigh Strangeness‚Äù be a false memory, a VE-3?

This is not a reasonable explanation because immediately after being confronted with the High Strangeness of children writing about what are called ‚Äúanomalous phenomena‚Äù, she texted fellow contact activist Kosta Makreas. I spoke to him the day after I viewed the interview. Kosta recalled receiving the message from Sin√©ad and reassuring her with a reply akin to ‚ÄúYep this is what happens.‚Äù

For decades, renowned UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee has pointed out that the intelligences responsible for UFOs appear to be able to manipulate spacetime. In my opinion, a consensus is beginning to emerge among contact experiencers as well as UFO investigators that the High Strangeness events associated with UFOs are showing us that materialist science‚Äôs explanations as to the nature of reality are at best incomplete. If consciousness, and not mass/energy is the wellspring of creation, then the fundamental assumptions of academic mainstream science are plainly wrong.¬†

**Conclusion**

If consciousness is primary, then perhaps our 4-D reality of spacetime is a kind of projection from some more fundamental realm that is pure consciousness. There has been much speculation in scientific circles that the Cosmos, and everything in it, is part of some simulation created by advanced intelligences. If this is true, then the alleged ETs might be able to enter our ‚Äúreality‚Äù at will and alter the simulation, thereby staging the ‚Äúinexplicable‚Äù events that we label ‚ÄúHigh Strangeness.‚Äù Sin√©ad ‚Äôs encountering a stack of ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù handwritten 6^(th)¬†grade compositions could very well be an example of a personal simulation being altered by her ‚Äúfriends in high places.‚Äù¬†¬†

**Contact activist¬†Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan obtained a photo of an ‚ÄúET‚Äù while participating in a CE-5.¬†Her story reveals not only the power of contact to transform a person‚Äôs world view but also provides a dramatic example of how UFO intelligences manipulate spacetime.**

**Joseph Burkes MD 2023**

**Introduction**

Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan is a contact activist that I met in November of 2021 when she produced an online video interview with me for the¬†**‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù website**. At that time, she had been working with researcher/author Grant Cameron for two years gaining experience as a researcher and interviewer. According to her brief bio on the ‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù webpage Sin√©ad¬†is a lifelong experiencer of multiple forms of paranormal high strangeness ‚Äúas well as being a lifelong spiritual practitioner.‚Äù¬†

I subscribe to Jeff Mara‚Äôs Podcast and when I saw her picture appear as a guest on his YouTube channel, I wanted to hear what she had to say. My curiosity was piqued when I read the provocative title of the program ‚Äú**Alien Stands Next To Her AT CE-5 Event ‚Äì ALIEN PHOTO.‚Äù**¬†

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s)

The event that she describes in which a small ‚Äúalien‚Äù being is photographed next to her during CE-5 fieldwork reminded me of an encounter that I had with my contact team one night in the Santa Monica Mountains in 1993.

**High Strangeness in Malibu Canyon**  
  
For five years back in the 1990s, I was a contact team leader for the CE-5 Initiative. Our group staged repeated Human Initiated Contact Events (HICE) in Southern California. During one outing the team was operating high up overlooking Malibu Canyon. While in deep meditation, I felt a strong pleasant pressure sensation in the middle of my chest. In retrospect, I imagine that my heart chakra was opening wide, because I was filled with a powerful peaceful loving feeling. After the meditation was over, my teammate, United Airlines Captain Joe Vallejo, told me the following:¬†

He stated that at one point during the meditation he had slightly opened his eyes. There, standing directly in front of me, was a small ‚Äúboxy‚Äù non-human being. Its rectangular form was only about two feet high, and it stood motionlessly less than twelve inches away from me. He reported that when he opened his eyes wide to get a better look, the rectangular form disappeared.¬†

**Sin√©ad ‚Äôs Photograph Obtained During Volunteer Contact Work**

During the last 20 minutes of Jeff Mara‚Äôs interview, Sin√©ad showed the photograph mentioned in the title of the program.¬†The digital picture was taken during an Illinois CE-5 nighttime outing in 2021. According to Sin√©ad, it was light blasted to bring out the details not easily seen because the picture was taken at night.¬†**Aside from the light blasting, no other alterations of the photograph were reportedly made.**¬†Sin√©ad gives her description of the photograph during the interview as follows:

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†This is a random photograph that was taken by a woman I didn‚Äôt know, who was in the circle. Now you‚Äôre seeing the very edge of the meditation circle‚Ä¶. Grant Cameron‚Ä¶¬†¬†was there with me‚Ä¶. So, my chair is on the other side of Grant.‚Ä¶.**And there‚Äôs a little being right there. And here‚Äôs the bright light coming out of my chest with these kinds of tendrils of light as well‚Ä¶**¬†

**A**nd then here‚Äôs a really super-duper close-up version of the little being‚Ä¶

**Jeff Mara:**¬†Would you say that that being is standing right next to your chair?

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†Yes, yeah and I felt it there, you know, even during that experience‚Ä¶ I was feeling them to my left ‚Ä¶ You can see where my body is‚Ä¶ and here‚Äôs the little being‚Äôs shoulder and there‚Äôs the neck, it‚Äôs head‚Ä¶ the eye.. and there are other beings in the photograph as well.¬†  
  
Understandably because of the photograph that Sin√©ad presented, there has been considerable public interest in this Jeff Mara podcast. In just a few weeks, over 60,000 views of this interview had been tallied. In my opinion, however, Sin√©ad Whelehan‚Äôs personal story as described in this in-depth interview is of even greater significance than the photographic evidence she obtained. Sin√©ad‚Äôs¬†¬†journey into contact has involved her overcoming many personal challenges. Perhaps the most important one is the fact that she is nearly totally deaf and has required two major surgeries for cochlear implants.¬†

**The Making of a Contact Activist**

In July of 2019, Sin√©ad experienced what she describes as a ‚Äúmassive awakening.‚Äù She explained the term ‚Äúawakening‚Äù might not be the best term to use because for decades she previously had engaged in spiritual practices like meditation and yoga. Nonetheless, what happened to her in 2019 was likened to ‚Äúbeing bonged on the head with the cosmic frying pan‚Ä¶‚Äù It happened as she was recovering from her second cochlear implant.¬†

Sin√©ad suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence in her room of multiple non-human entities who communicated with her telepathically. According to Sin√©ad, the beings were saying, ‚ÄúOK. It‚Äôs time! We‚Äôve been with you all along. It‚Äôs now time. You have a job to do!‚Äù¬†¬†¬†And her mission was to spread the word that every one of us are cosmic beings. And we need to recognize our long-standing relationship with ‚Äúthe extraterrestrials.‚Äù This new sense of duty, however, was not without a downside.¬†

For two decades Sin√©ad had a very responsible position as a public-school teacher in Canada. She worked in special education for elementary and high school students. Her profession gave her an opportunity to work with children, something she has always loved doing. In addition, her position provided her with a good income, job security and benefits. She found herself in a dilemma, how could she change her life in ways that were consistent with the radical paradigm shift that she was undergoing?¬†  
  
**In the following section of this report, Sin√©ad Whelehan reveals one of the most astounding contact events that I have ever come across.**¬†In my judgment, this vignette is an example of how UFO intelligences can manipulate spacetime. Sin√©ad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.)¬†

I‚Äôm in the process of opening a specialty coffee shop in Chile, and I‚Äôm trying to decide between two espresso machines for my business. The options I‚Äôm considering are:
	1.	Nuova Simonelli Aurelia Wave Semi-Automatic (2 groups)
	2.	La Marzocco Linea Classic S (2 groups)

What I‚Äôm looking for:
	‚Ä¢	Consistency in espresso quality.
	‚Ä¢	Ease of maintenance and availability of technical support.
	‚Ä¢	Durability to handle a moderate to high volume of customers.
	‚Ä¢	Real-world performance feedback from anyone who‚Äôs used these machines.

Context:

Both machines are available in Chile and have technical support in the country. My budget allows for either, but I want to ensure that I‚Äôm investing in the right machine for a specialty coffee shop environment.

Does anyone have experience with either (or both) of these machines? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and recommendations! Thanks in advance! ‚òïüôå",1,1735258036.0,barista,6,1.0,False

Sin√©ad Whelehan's ""Alien"" Photo, ""Awakening"" & the Manipulation of Spacetime

","[Contact Activist Sin√©ad Whelehan has experienced multiple Contact Modalities ](https://preview.redd.it/ozul2yht7a9e1.jpg?width=164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe2081ad3ea6cd37db5d78345868f8ae09f61daa)

**Contact activist¬†Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan obtained a photo of an ‚ÄúET‚Äù while participating in a CE-5.¬†Her story reveals not only the power of contact to transform a person‚Äôs world view but also provides a dramatic example of how UFO intelligences manipulate spacetime.**

**Joseph Burkes MD 2023**

**Introduction**

Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan is a contact activist that I met in November of 2021 when she produced an online video interview with me for the¬†**‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù website**. At that time, she had been working with researcher/author Grant Cameron for two years gaining experience as a researcher and interviewer. According to her brief bio on the ‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù webpage Sin√©ad¬†is a lifelong experiencer of multiple forms of paranormal high strangeness ‚Äúas well as being a lifelong spiritual practitioner.‚Äù¬†

I subscribe to Jeff Mara‚Äôs Podcast and when I saw her picture appear as a guest on his YouTube channel, I wanted to hear what she had to say. My curiosity was piqued when I read the provocative title of the program ‚Äú**Alien Stands Next To Her AT CE-5 Event ‚Äì ALIEN PHOTO.‚Äù**¬†

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s)

https://preview.redd.it/p7yqby248a9e1.jpg?width=216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88f33c6d3c2f9679fecb605cd7d3943258cd817a

The event that she describes in which a small ‚Äúalien‚Äù being is photographed next to her during CE-5 fieldwork reminded me of an encounter that I had with my contact team one night in the Santa Monica Mountains in 1993.

**High Strangeness in Malibu Canyon**  
  
For five years back in the 1990s, I was a contact team leader for the CE-5 Initiative. Our group staged repeated Human Initiated Contact Events (HICE) in Southern California. During one outing the team was operating high up overlooking Malibu Canyon. While in deep meditation, I felt a strong pleasant pressure sensation in the middle of my chest. In retrospect, I imagine that my heart chakra was opening wide, because I was filled with a powerful peaceful loving feeling. After the meditation was over, my teammate, United Airlines Captain Joe Vallejo, told me the following:¬†

He stated that at one point during the meditation he had slightly opened his eyes. There, standing directly in front of me, was a small ‚Äúboxy‚Äù non-human being. Its rectangular form was only about two feet high, and it stood motionlessly less than twelve inches away from me. He reported that when he opened his eyes wide to get a better look, the rectangular form disappeared.¬†

**Sin√©ad ‚Äôs Photograph Obtained During Volunteer Contact Work**

During the last 20 minutes of Jeff Mara‚Äôs interview, Sin√©ad showed the photograph mentioned in the title of the program.¬†The digital picture was taken during an Illinois CE-5 nighttime outing in 2021. According to Sin√©ad, it was light blasted to bring out the details not easily seen because the picture was taken at night.¬†**Aside from the light blasting, no other alterations of the photograph were reportedly made.**¬†Sin√©ad gives her description of the photograph during the interview as follows:

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†This is a random photograph that was taken by a woman I didn‚Äôt know, who was in the circle. Now you‚Äôre seeing the very edge of the meditation circle‚Ä¶. Grant Cameron‚Ä¶¬†¬†was there with me‚Ä¶. So, my chair is on the other side of Grant.‚Ä¶.**And there‚Äôs a little being right there. And here‚Äôs the bright light coming out of my chest with these kinds of tendrils of light as well‚Ä¶**¬†

**A**nd then here‚Äôs a really super-duper close-up version of the little being‚Ä¶

**Jeff Mara:**¬†Would you say that that being is standing right next to your chair?

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†Yes, yeah and I felt it there, you know, even during that experience‚Ä¶ I was feeling them to my left ‚Ä¶ You can see where my body is‚Ä¶ and here‚Äôs the little being‚Äôs shoulder and there‚Äôs the neck, it‚Äôs head‚Ä¶ the eye.. and there are other beings in the photograph as well.¬†  
  
Understandably because of the photograph that Sin√©ad presented, there has been considerable public interest in this Jeff Mara podcast. In just a few weeks, over 60,000 views of this interview had been tallied. In my opinion, however, Sin√©ad Whelehan‚Äôs personal story as described in this in-depth interview is of even greater significance than the photographic evidence she obtained. Sin√©ad‚Äôs¬†¬†journey into contact has involved her overcoming many personal challenges. Perhaps the most important one is the fact that she is nearly totally deaf and has required two major surgeries for cochlear implants.¬†

**The Making of a Contact Activist**

In July of 2019, Sin√©ad experienced what she describes as a ‚Äúmassive awakening.‚Äù She explained the term ‚Äúawakening‚Äù might not be the best term to use because for decades she previously had engaged in spiritual practices like meditation and yoga. Nonetheless, what happened to her in 2019 was likened to ‚Äúbeing bonged on the head with the cosmic frying pan‚Ä¶‚Äù It happened as she was recovering from her second cochlear implant.¬†

Sin√©ad suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence in her room of multiple non-human entities who communicated with her telepathically. According to Sin√©ad, the beings were saying, ‚ÄúOK. It‚Äôs time! We‚Äôve been with you all along. It‚Äôs now time. You have a job to do!‚Äù¬†¬†¬†And her mission was to spread the word that every one of us are cosmic beings. And we need to recognize our long-standing relationship with ‚Äúthe extraterrestrials.‚Äù This new sense of duty, however, was not without a downside.¬†

For two decades Sin√©ad had a very responsible position as a public-school teacher in Canada. She worked in special education for elementary and high school students. Her profession gave her an opportunity to work with children, something she has always loved doing. In addition, her position provided her with a good income, job security and benefits. She found herself in a dilemma, how could she change her life in ways that were consistent with the radical paradigm shift that she was undergoing?¬†  
  
**In the following section of this report, Sin√©ad Whelehan reveals one of the most astounding contact events that I have ever come across.**¬†In my judgment, this vignette is an example of how UFO intelligences can manipulate spacetime. Sin√©ad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.)¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that feeling that experiencers often talk about. I just knew that it was ETs.¬†¬†I knew what they were telling me was real.¬†¬†And believe me, I had moments of doubting myself. Then, I would ask them for validation, and they would give me ridiculous validation that was absolutely undeniable.¬†¬†

An example is that I‚Äôm a teacher.¬†¬†This happened in the summer (of 2019). I had my ‚Äúawakening‚Äù in July and about two weeks after the ‚Äúbig cosmic frying pan experience‚Äù happened. I had already been hired months before to mark government literacy tests. There are these booklets that are sent out to kids all over the country. In Canada they were sent out to kids in grade 6 to test their math and their literacy (skills).¬†

So, I was hired to mark these booklets and score them. (This project was) to track the data for kids all over the country in terms of their literacy levels. This job was done in a massive warehouse. And there I was with all these tired teachers, you know, trudging in with big jugs of coffee. They were chugging down their coffee through the day and marking these booklets. It was just such dry work and in this big, huge empty warehouse. And, you know, we got cattle called back after breaks. It felt like such a massive juxtaposition to the vibration that I had experienced (with the ETs) just a short while before that I started to feel like,‚Äù Oh my God, I have gone crazy.‚Äù¬†

So, I started getting worried about myself.¬†¬†I went home one day‚Ä¶ and I was very upset.¬†¬†I just started talking to them (the ETs) out loud. I‚Äôm not someone who grew up religious‚Ä¶ I never prayed in my life, but I just started talking to them. I was sitting on the floor of my living room crying a little bit, really, really distressed, and stressed out. (I was) wondering if I was mentally well. I asked them, if this (the continuous presence of ET beings in her life) is really true, ‚ÄúI need you to prove it to me. I need you to prove it to me in a way that is undeniable and unmistakable‚Ä¶.‚Äù

So, then I felt this very warm soothing presence around me, and I relaxed. I felt better and I went to bed.¬†¬†Woke up the next day, drove to work. It started as usual‚Ä¶ (What) we‚Äôre supposed to do is just walk up to the front of the room where there‚Äôs this massive floor to ceiling shelf. I grab a random stack of booklets, bring them back to our desk and start marking them‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre supposed to mark exactly the same question over and over again. So, each (student)answers the question differently.¬†¬†They are 10-11 years old. They‚Äôre in grade 6 and supposed to be writing about ‚Äúthe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù It‚Äôs a creative writing challenge for them.

**Astounding High Strangeness Event**

On that day, for 45 minutes, from 9:00 o‚Äôclock until 9:45 every single booklet I opened had compositions about, ET s, UFOs, flying cars, free energy, portals, ‚Äúthe earth is alive‚Äù, ‚Äúthe Galaxy is full of other beings‚Äù (What) I was reading ‚Ä¶ has nothing to do with the original prompt ‚ÄúThe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù Nothing to do with it! Here are these kids writing in pencil in 10- to 11-year-old child‚Äôs writing, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a portal in my bedroom‚Äù, ‚ÄúI designed time travel‚Äù, ‚ÄúI made a time machine‚Äù, ‚Äúthe earth is alive and conscious; she knows what we‚Äôre all doing to her‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere are spaceships out there.‚Äù I mean I just couldn‚Äôt believe it. I could not believe it!

We were not allowed to take breaks that early in the morning, but I just said, ‚ÄúI have to‚Äù‚Ä¶ I went to the washroom. I texted a bunch of friends of mine who I had met by that point in the community because immediately after my awakening I just started reaching out to people for help. I needed to understand what was going on. I connected with the lovely Kosta Makreas (who was recently interviewed on the Jeff Mara Podcast). Kosta was immediately there for me, to support me. I texted him and a couple of other people he had introduced me to‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI need you to tell me if this is real. Did this really just happen?‚Äù Meanwhile the hairs on the skin of my arms are standing straight up.¬†¬†

(There I am) in a stall in the bathroom furiously typing.¬†¬†They all wrote me back and said, ‚ÄúYep this is what happens.‚Äù You know, this is exactly it! I mean how can you deny that is validation! Not to mention, when I came back from the bathroom, the rest of the booklets that were on my desk, I think there were three or four left, none of them had anything to do with it (the flying saucer/paranormal themes). It was all back to the question (and for the rest of the day it was the original composition prompt question) ‚ÄúHow I Became Famous‚Äù (The answers were what one might expect from 6^(th)¬†graders, things like) ‚Äúbecause of YouTube.‚Äù¬†

**Discussion:**

**How were**¬†the non-human intelligences that contacted Sin√©ad able to stage such an extremely strange sequence of events? She asked for a clear sign that her contacts and communications were real and not the result of her being mentally imbalanced. The very next day the compositions written by 6^(th)¬†graders deviated from the assignment. Instead of writing ‚ÄúThe Day I Became Famous‚Äù, they wrote about numerous themes associated with ‚ÄúET contact.‚Äù¬†¬†

For two decades I have promoted what I call the Virtual Experience Model for flying saucer investigations. This theory outlines what I believe are consciousness-based/‚Äúillusory‚Äù mechanisms of contact employed by UFO intelligences during interactions with people targeted for encounters. According to this proposed model, a Virtual Experience of the Third Kind (VE-3) is a false memory inserted into the consciousness of a contact experiencers by flying saucer intelligences. These ‚Äúthought forms‚Äù might be so skillfully done that the false memories convince the experiencer that they represent recollections of actual events. Could Sin√©ad ‚Äôs recollection of this ‚ÄúHigh Strangeness‚Äù be a false memory, a VE-3?

This is not a reasonable explanation because immediately after being confronted with the High Strangeness of children writing about what are called ‚Äúanomalous phenomena‚Äù, she texted fellow contact activist Kosta Makreas. I spoke to him the day after I viewed the interview. Kosta recalled receiving the message from Sin√©ad and reassuring her with a reply akin to ‚ÄúYep this is what happens.‚Äù

For decades, renowned UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee has pointed out that the intelligences responsible for UFOs appear to be able to manipulate spacetime. In my opinion, a consensus is beginning to emerge among contact experiencers as well as UFO investigators that the High Strangeness events associated with UFOs are showing us that materialist science‚Äôs explanations as to the nature of reality are at best incomplete. If consciousness, and not mass/energy is the wellspring of creation, then the fundamental assumptions of academic mainstream science are plainly wrong.¬†

**Conclusion**

If consciousness is primary, then perhaps our 4-D reality of spacetime is a kind of projection from some more fundamental realm that is pure consciousness. There has been much speculation in scientific circles that the Cosmos, and everything in it, is part of some simulation created by advanced intelligences. If this is true, then the alleged ETs might be able to enter our ‚Äúreality‚Äù at will and alter the simulation, thereby staging the ‚Äúinexplicable‚Äù events that we label ‚ÄúHigh Strangeness.‚Äù Sin√©ad ‚Äôs encountering a stack of ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù handwritten 6^(th)¬†grade compositions could very well be an example of a personal simulation being altered by her ‚Äúfriends in high places.‚Äù¬†¬†

**Introduction**

Sin√©ad¬†Whelehan is a contact activist that I met in November of 2021 when she produced an online video interview with me for the¬†**‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù website**. At that time, she had been working with researcher/author Grant Cameron for two years gaining experience as a researcher and interviewer. According to her brief bio on the ‚ÄúBeyond Being Human‚Äù webpage Sin√©ad¬†is a lifelong experiencer of multiple forms of paranormal high strangeness ‚Äúas well as being a lifelong spiritual practitioner.‚Äù¬†

I subscribe to Jeff Mara‚Äôs Podcast and when I saw her picture appear as a guest on his YouTube channel, I wanted to hear what she had to say. My curiosity was piqued when I read the provocative title of the program ‚Äú**Alien Stands Next To Her AT CE-5 Event ‚Äì ALIEN PHOTO.‚Äù**¬†

https://preview.redd.it/gpssror17a9e1.jpg?width=216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de55af86ed98eb9a88b249ee7d9d4e0de3c3ef3c

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s)

The event that she describes in which a small ‚Äúalien‚Äù being is photographed next to her during CE-5 fieldwork reminded me of an encounter that I had with my contact team one night in the Santa Monica Mountains in 1993.

**High Strangeness in Malibu Canyon**  
  
For five years back in the 1990s, I was a contact team leader for the CE-5 Initiative. Our group staged repeated Human Initiated Contact Events (HICE) in Southern California. During one outing the team was operating high up overlooking Malibu Canyon. While in deep meditation, I felt a strong pleasant pressure sensation in the middle of my chest. In retrospect, I imagine that my heart chakra was opening wide, because I was filled with a powerful peaceful loving feeling. After the meditation was over, my teammate, United Airlines Captain Joe Vallejo, told me the following:¬†

He stated that at one point during the meditation he had slightly opened his eyes. There, standing directly in front of me, was a small ‚Äúboxy‚Äù non-human being. Its rectangular form was only about two feet high, and it stood motionlessly less than twelve inches away from me. He reported that when he opened his eyes wide to get a better look, the rectangular form disappeared.¬†

**Sin√©ad ‚Äôs Photograph Obtained During Volunteer Contact Work**

During the last 20 minutes of Jeff Mara‚Äôs interview, Sin√©ad showed the photograph mentioned in the title of the program.¬†The digital picture was taken during an Illinois CE-5 nighttime outing in 2021. According to Sin√©ad, it was light blasted to bring out the details not easily seen because the picture was taken at night.¬†**Aside from the light blasting, no other alterations of the photograph were reportedly made.**¬†Sin√©ad gives her description of the photograph during the interview as follows:

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†This is a random photograph that was taken by a woman I didn‚Äôt know, who was in the circle. Now you‚Äôre seeing the very edge of the meditation circle‚Ä¶. Grant Cameron‚Ä¶¬†¬†was there with me‚Ä¶. So, my chair is on the other side of Grant.‚Ä¶.**And there‚Äôs a little being right there. And here‚Äôs the bright light coming out of my chest with these kinds of tendrils of light as well‚Ä¶**¬†

**A**nd then here‚Äôs a really super-duper close-up version of the little being‚Ä¶

**Jeff Mara:**¬†Would you say that that being is standing right next to your chair?

**Sin√©ad Whelehan:**¬†Yes, yeah and I felt it there, you know, even during that experience‚Ä¶ I was feeling them to my left ‚Ä¶ You can see where my body is‚Ä¶ and here‚Äôs the little being‚Äôs shoulder and there‚Äôs the neck, it‚Äôs head‚Ä¶ the eye.. and there are other beings in the photograph as well.¬†  
  
Understandably because of the photograph that Sin√©ad presented, there has been considerable public interest in this Jeff Mara podcast. In just a few weeks, over 60,000 views of this interview had been tallied. In my opinion, however, Sin√©ad Whelehan‚Äôs personal story as described in this in-depth interview is of even greater significance than the photographic evidence she obtained. Sin√©ad‚Äôs¬†¬†journey into contact has involved her overcoming many personal challenges. Perhaps the most important one is the fact that she is nearly totally deaf and has required two major surgeries for cochlear implants.¬†

**The Making of a Contact Activist**

In July of 2019, Sin√©ad experienced what she describes as a ‚Äúmassive awakening.‚Äù She explained the term ‚Äúawakening‚Äù might not be the best term to use because for decades she previously had engaged in spiritual practices like meditation and yoga. Nonetheless, what happened to her in 2019 was likened to ‚Äúbeing bonged on the head with the cosmic frying pan‚Ä¶‚Äù It happened as she was recovering from her second cochlear implant.¬†

Sin√©ad suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence in her room of multiple non-human entities who communicated with her telepathically. According to Sin√©ad, the beings were saying, ‚ÄúOK. It‚Äôs time! We‚Äôve been with you all along. It‚Äôs now time. You have a job to do!‚Äù¬†¬†¬†And her mission was to spread the word that every one of us are cosmic beings. And we need to recognize our long-standing relationship with ‚Äúthe extraterrestrials.‚Äù This new sense of duty, however, was not without a downside.¬†

For two decades Sin√©ad had a very responsible position as a public-school teacher in Canada. She worked in special education for elementary and high school students. Her profession gave her an opportunity to work with children, something she has always loved doing. In addition, her position provided her with a good income, job security and benefits. She found herself in a dilemma, how could she change her life in ways that were consistent with the radical paradigm shift that she was undergoing?¬†  
  
**In the following section of this report, Sin√©ad Whelehan reveals one of the most astounding contact events that I have ever come across.**¬†In my judgment, this vignette is an example of how UFO intelligences can manipulate spacetime. Sin√©ad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.)¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that feeling that experiencers often talk about. I just knew that it was ETs.¬†¬†I knew what they were telling me was real.¬†¬†And believe me, I had moments of doubting myself. Then, I would ask them for validation, and they would give me ridiculous validation that was absolutely undeniable.¬†¬†

An example is that I‚Äôm a teacher.¬†¬†This happened in the summer (of 2019). I had my ‚Äúawakening‚Äù in July and about two weeks after the ‚Äúbig cosmic frying pan experience‚Äù happened. I had already been hired months before to mark government literacy tests. There are these booklets that are sent out to kids all over the country. In Canada they were sent out to kids in grade 6 to test their math and their literacy (skills).¬†

So, I was hired to mark these booklets and score them. (This project was) to track the data for kids all over the country in terms of their literacy levels. This job was done in a massive warehouse. And there I was with all these tired teachers, you know, trudging in with big jugs of coffee. They were chugging down their coffee through the day and marking these booklets. It was just such dry work and in this big, huge empty warehouse. And, you know, we got cattle called back after breaks. It felt like such a massive juxtaposition to the vibration that I had experienced (with the ETs) just a short while before that I started to feel like,‚Äù Oh my God, I have gone crazy.‚Äù¬†

So, I started getting worried about myself.¬†¬†I went home one day‚Ä¶ and I was very upset.¬†¬†I just started talking to them (the ETs) out loud. I‚Äôm not someone who grew up religious‚Ä¶ I never prayed in my life, but I just started talking to them. I was sitting on the floor of my living room crying a little bit, really, really distressed, and stressed out. (I was) wondering if I was mentally well. I asked them, if this (the continuous presence of ET beings in her life) is really true, ‚ÄúI need you to prove it to me. I need you to prove it to me in a way that is undeniable and unmistakable‚Ä¶.‚Äù

So, then I felt this very warm soothing presence around me, and I relaxed. I felt better and I went to bed.¬†¬†Woke up the next day, drove to work. It started as usual‚Ä¶ (What) we‚Äôre supposed to do is just walk up to the front of the room where there‚Äôs this massive floor to ceiling shelf. I grab a random stack of booklets, bring them back to our desk and start marking them‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre supposed to mark exactly the same question over and over again. So, each (student)answers the question differently.¬†¬†They are 10-11 years old. They‚Äôre in grade 6 and supposed to be writing about ‚Äúthe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù It‚Äôs a creative writing challenge for them.

**Astounding High Strangeness Event**

On that day, for 45 minutes, from 9:00 o‚Äôclock until 9:45 every single booklet I opened had compositions about, ET s, UFOs, flying cars, free energy, portals, ‚Äúthe earth is alive‚Äù, ‚Äúthe Galaxy is full of other beings‚Äù (What) I was reading ‚Ä¶ has nothing to do with the original prompt ‚ÄúThe Day I Became Famous.‚Äù Nothing to do with it! Here are these kids writing in pencil in 10- to 11-year-old child‚Äôs writing, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a portal in my bedroom‚Äù, ‚ÄúI designed time travel‚Äù, ‚ÄúI made a time machine‚Äù, ‚Äúthe earth is alive and conscious; she knows what we‚Äôre all doing to her‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere are spaceships out there.‚Äù I mean I just couldn‚Äôt believe it. I could not believe it!

We were not allowed to take breaks that early in the morning, but I just said, ‚ÄúI have to‚Äù‚Ä¶ I went to the washroom. I texted a bunch of friends of mine who I had met by that point in the community because immediately after my awakening I just started reaching out to people for help. I needed to understand what was going on. I connected with the lovely Kosta Makreas (who was recently interviewed on the Jeff Mara Podcast). Kosta was immediately there for me, to support me. I texted him and a couple of other people he had introduced me to‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI need you to tell me if this is real. Did this really just happen?‚Äù Meanwhile the hairs on the skin of my arms are standing straight up.¬†¬†

(There I am) in a stall in the bathroom furiously typing.¬†¬†They all wrote me back and said, ‚ÄúYep this is what happens.‚Äù You know, this is exactly it! I mean how can you deny that is validation! Not to mention, when I came back from the bathroom, the rest of the booklets that were on my desk, I think there were three or four left, none of them had anything to do with it (the flying saucer/paranormal themes). It was all back to the question (and for the rest of the day it was the original composition prompt question) ‚ÄúHow I Became Famous‚Äù (The answers were what one might expect from 6^(th)¬†graders, things like) ‚Äúbecause of YouTube.‚Äù¬†

**Discussion:**

**How were**¬†the non-human intelligences that contacted Sin√©ad able to stage such an extremely strange sequence of events? She asked for a clear sign that her contacts and communications were real and not the result of her being mentally imbalanced.

I‚Äôm 28f and was diagnosed a year ago and started taking meds for the first time around that time. I‚Äôve tried many different meds and dosages for ADHD and Vyvanse has been my favourite. The clarity and quietness it brought to my mind was life changing. I was on 50mg for a while, however I noticed that my sensory issues(I‚Äôm autistic as well) were worse, my anxiety and irritability and anger outbursts were worse and I struggled to multitask. I also had meltdowns more often. I reduced my dosage to 30mg for the past 2 months and I miss the boost of energy and drive I would get to actually focus and get my chores done and talking a mile a minute. My main question is how is the correct dosage supposed to make you feel? I‚Äôm considering 40mg, but I would like input please. I have PMDD as well and my executive function is also very bad at the moment. My OT sessions aren‚Äôt helping. Even if I take the 50mg meds I‚Äôm still bedboud 99% of the time. I‚Äôve seen posts about Vyvanse being more effective when taken with certain meds and high protein breakfast etc however my psychiatrist didn‚Äôt mention that. I currently take them as soon as I wake up. Also, these meds are so expensive I don‚Äôt want to waste money when I feel like I‚Äôm not getting the full use if my dosage is too low. Also, how does coffee make you feel? It gives me heart palpitations and so does decaf, but I bought a different brand of decaf coffee today, just so I can feel the boost of energy the 50mg gave me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Many people enjoy a good cup of coffee to jumpstart their day. After teeth whitening, however, it‚Äôs essential to think about the impact of beverages on your smile. After whitening treatments, your teeth may become porous and susceptible to stains. This is why drinking coffee through a straw can be a beneficial strategy to maintain that bright smile.

### Protects Your Smile

One of the primary benefits of using a straw is that it helps to protect your teeth from being stained by coffee. Since coffee is known for its rich pigments, placing a straw at the back of your mouth minimizes contact between your pearly whites and the coffee, allowing you to enjoy your favorite beverage without compromising your recent whitening efforts.

### Reduces Sensitivity

Teeth whitening can sometimes lead to increased tooth sensitivity. Drinking through a straw can help reduce discomfort. The temperature of the drink can significantly affect sensitive teeth, and by using a straw, you can avoid the cold liquid making direct contact with your teeth, thus minimizing any risk of discomfort.

### Enhances Flavor Satisfaction

While the primary concern may be the impact on your teeth, drinking coffee through a straw can actually enhance your coffee experience. Some people find that sipping through a straw allows for a different taste sensation, as the liquid bypasses some of your taste buds on the tongue, offering a fresher approach to savoring your beverage.

### Convenience on the Go

Using a straw is often more convenient for those with busy lifestyles. You can easily sip your coffee while driving or working, which is a significant advantage if you‚Äôre constantly on the run. The portability factor makes coffee more accessible, so you can enjoy it wherever life takes you while keeping your teeth protected.

### Encourages Hydration

Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining oral health, especially after whitening. Drinking coffee might lead to dehydration if consumed excessively, but using a straw encourages smaller sips. This measured approach can keep you more aware of how much coffee you are drinking, prompting you to mix in some water or other hydrating beverages.

### How to Choose the Right Straw

When considering drinking coffee through a straw, it's essential to choose the right type. Here are some options:

- **Silicone Straws:** Flexible and reusable, making them a great eco-friendly choice.
- **Plastic Straws:** Convenient but look for BPA-free options.
- **Stainless Steel Straws:** Durable and easy to clean, they are also aesthetically pleasing.
- **Bamboo Straws:** Natural and biodegradable, perfect for those looking for sustainable choices.

### Final Thoughts

Drinking coffee through a straw after teeth whitening not only protects your bright smile but also enhances your coffee experience. It minimizes contact with your teeth, thereby reducing the risk of staining and discomfort. Moreover, sipping through a straw promotes convenience, can lead to better hydration habits, and gives you options when it comes to choosing eco-friendly straws. By making this small adjustment in your coffee-drinking habits, you can enjoy your daily boost of energy while keeping your teeth in pristine condition.

So next time you reach for that cup of coffee, consider opting for a straw to enjoy your drink without the worry of tarnishing your dazzling smile.

Best Practices for Maintaining Your White Smile While Enjoying Coffee
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintaining a bright smile can feel like a challenge, especially for coffee lovers. After enjoying a professional teeth whitening treatment, it‚Äôs essential to understand how to keep that shine while indulging in your favorite brewed beverage. Let‚Äôs explore the best practices to enjoy coffee without compromising your pearly whites.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
First, timing is everything. After a teeth whitening session, your teeth are more porous and prone to staining. It‚Äôs recommended to wait at least 24 to 48 hours before drinking coffee. This waiting period allows your enamel to re-mineralize and strengthens the protective barrier against stains. Mark your calendar, and be patient ‚Äî a little extra wait can save you from a dull smile!

If you find yourself craving coffee post-whitening, consider choosing lighter options. Dark roasts and espresso are strong contenders for teeth staining. Instead, opt for lighter coffee types, such as:

- Blonde roasts
- Filtered coffee
- Caf√© au lait made with steamed milk

These varieties are often less potent in terms of staining potential, helping to preserve that brilliant smile.

Another great tip is to drink coffee through a straw. Using a straw minimizes the contact coffee has with your teeth, significantly reducing the risk of staining. Choose a reusable silicone or stainless-steel straw to make a positive impact on the environment while protecting your teeth. This simple swap makes your coffee experience both eco-friendly and smile-friendly.

Moreover, consider how you take your coffee. Adding milk or cream can dilute the pigment in coffee, lessening the potential for stains. If you're a fan of adding flavor, consider using non-dairy alternatives such as almond milk or oat milk. These options don't just taste good; they can also be less acidic than regular milk, making them gentler on your teeth.

Rinsing your mouth with water after enjoying your coffee is another essential practice. This helps wash away any residue left behind and neutralizes the acidity in the coffee. Keeping a bottle of water nearby can serve as a reminder to rinse right after your drink. Just a few swishes can keep your teeth cleaner and whiter.

If you still find yourself struggling to keep your smile bright, consider utilizing whitening toothpaste designed for daily use. These products typically contain mild abrasives and gentle whitening agents that can combat staining when used regularly. You may also want to discuss preventive options with your dentist, such as whitening trays or touch-up treatments, which can help maintain your smile in between professional whitening sessions.

It‚Äôs crucial to maintain a consistent oral hygiene routine. Brushing at least twice a day and flossing daily removes plaque and minimizes the risk of discoloration. Don‚Äôt forget to replace your toothbrush every three months and attend regular dental cleanings for the best results. Healthy gums and teeth will enhance your smile‚Äôs brightness.

Some of these best practices can provide a perfect balance between enjoying your daily coffee and maintaining a dazzling smile. Protecting your teeth doesn‚Äôt have to mean sacrificing your favorite beverage. With a few mindful adjustments, you can relish every sip without worry.

Staying informed about the impact of coffee on your whitening results can also be beneficial. If you notice any changes in the brightness of your smile, don‚Äôt hesitate to consult with your dentist. They can provide tailored solutions that suit your preferences and lifestyle, ensuring you can enjoy coffee while keeping your teeth healthy and white.

Your smile is your best accessory, so take pride in it! With these strategies at hand, you can confidently sip your coffee, knowing you‚Äôre doing your best to maintain that beautiful, bright grin. You deserve to enjoy the little pleasures in life without sacrificing your oral health.

### Conclusion

Maintaining a bright, white smile after teeth whitening can be quite the challenge, especially for coffee lovers. Drinking coffee through a straw presents a practical solution, allowing you to enjoy your favorite beverage while minimizing direct contact with your teeth. This simple change can significantly reduce the risk of staining, helping you maintain your radiant smile for longer.

Moreover, it‚Äôs essential to adopt best practices alongside using a straw. Rinsing your mouth with water after enjoying a cup of coffee can wash away any pigments that may cling to your enamel. Regular brushing and using whitening toothpaste also enhance your smile‚Äôs longevity. Don't forget about regular dental check-ups; your dentist can provide professional advice and the best products to keep your teeth shining.

so long story short I am 24 years old, after a long long time traveling and living in a different city I returned home to live with my father (who wants me to be with him). We have a small business together that paid off our house and pays the majority of the bills. But I really believe I need a better personal job for my age. I didn‚Äôt go to college nor do I have any marketable skill. All I want to do in life is literally draw/write, yes really only draw/write for the rest of my life. But the only thing that keeps me from doing this peacefully is the fact the besides our small business my other job is just working at a coffee shop. It‚Äôs actually a job I love doing currently, the customers, management, and tips are good. However obviously I don‚Äôt want to do this forever. I just need a regular stable 9-5 type job so I can come home and draw/write and repeat. That‚Äôs all I want to do and I believe it will give me the peace of mind I am looking for. I just don‚Äôt know how to get that sort of job. my resume is full of restaurants and retail and I will be honest I have not been applying to many new jobs over the past year. I feel like I either have two choices‚Ä¶

1. do not go to college, and just try and find a slightly better job that I can manage

2. Go to college, still work at my same job until I complete at least a basic AA degree 

I just feel terrible because if I work, go to college, and do other life tasks, I am going to be so behind in my art/writing journey because well, drawing and writing is hard‚Ä¶ In have only completed two small projects in the 2 years I have been doing art and I am not getting any younger‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really the only thing I like to do and I unfortunately do to poor life events I wish I just had a more stable long term career already, or at least passed through college, so I can just focus on the one thing I know I love to do.

1hn1ff1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1hn1ff1/how_to_combat_emotional_pain_depression_caused_by/,"How to combat emotional pain & depression caused by chronic pain
","In this post, I‚Äôll share a few lifestyle strategies that have helped me to combat depression and emotional pain. For context, I am a 34F with decades of chronic pain experience. I was raised in a domestic violence environment where I was brutally beaten, starved, humiliated, and SA‚Äôed for over two decades. In my early 20s, I ran away, built a career for myself working in tech, and haven‚Äôt looked back. It has not been easy. I‚Äôve had no family, no financial support (apart from what I earn for myself), and no caretaking resources. I live with a degenerative neck and spine injury, autoimmune diseases, muscular dystrophy, and physical deformities resultant of decades of battery and malnutrition.

We all live with our own version of physical and emotional pain. While the physical pain can be debilitating on its own, emotional pain can become a hidden threat. It erodes our self-worth, diminishes our will to go on, and strips away our sense of peace. I believe that we owe it to ourselves to combat the emotional pain, just as we do with the physical pain.

**Before I begin, I want to be clear:** this post is not a cure for depression. That takes time and treatment. What it can offer however, is help and support to achieve a better quality of life and gain a greater sense of control over what happens to us. Not everything on this list will pertain to everyone. Some items come from my own personal experience (I'll label which those are).

**1. Design a routine**

Routines make life feel normal and productive. Sometimes, living in chronic pain forces us to forfeit our routine to adapt to care needs. As a result, days start to feel longer, our minds start to wander, and our overall sense of purpose begins to fade. Introducing a new routine can be a critical step in restoring a bit of normalcy. The key is to design one that fits into your needs and limitations.

To ensure that your routine is successful, avoid launching the entire thing, all at once. Doing so sets you up for failure because sweeping changes don‚Äôt happen overnight. Instead, it‚Äôs best to start small and gradually build up over time. For example, you might start out doing red light therapy for just 5 minutes each morning and build up to 20 minutes over several weeks. Gradual changes allow you to make new habits stick.

If it helps, consider using a routine-building app or even a free Google Calendar that comes with every gmail account to design your routine. Below is a sample routine that could be reached slowly after several weeks to months:

1. Wake up
2. Coffee + red light therapy
3. Light stretches while watching the news or podcast
4. Personal hygiene(brush hair, clean skin, etc.)
5. Breakfast
6. Help out your family members or caretakers (make calls, handle bills, do little things that they need)
7. Learn or practice a new skill (learn to cook, learn a language, learn to draw, etc.)
8. Light stretches or a walk
9. Lunch
10. Reach out to friends
11. Dinner
12. Wind-down
13. Bed

**2. Consider trying talk therapy**

Having a therapist who gets you can be life-changing. While some of us may have friends and family in our lives who we can turn to, we can only expect so much from them by way of emotional support. A therapist fills in that gap ‚Äî their entire job is to help you identify and work toward your emotional goals, whatever they may be. For those interested in giving talk therapy a try, I previously wrote up a list of [low-cost and free therapy resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1h4l4tp/how_to_care_for_your_mental_health_and_have_your/).

**3. Practice gratitude**

With so much physical and emotional pain tormenting us 24/7, it can be easy to focus on the darkness in our lives. That darkness exists and is valid, but there can be some light, too.

Practicing gratitude allows us to recognize the good and feel less weighed down by the bad. For example, you may have a family to take care of you, a place to live, a warm, cozy bed, nourishing meals, access to medical care, etc.¬†

Consider making a list of the things you‚Äôre grateful for or using a gratitude app to keep track of the positive things in your life. Over time, you may notice a mental shift where everyday stressors feel a little less upsetting.

**4. Optimize your physical space**

It's extremely hard to feel emotionally ok when your physical space is uncomfortable. I start to feel anxious as soon as my room gets the least bit messy. A clean and de-cluttered physical space can be so vital to one's mental health, but it can also be challenging to maintain when living with chronic pain.

A few strategies you can try include:

* Practicing minimalism to declutter possessions
* Having a family member, friend, or hired cleaning person help out
* Cleaning things up in small, manageable bits (can fit into a daily routine)

**5. Grow relationships and do things for others**

Chronic illness can strip us of our humanity in the sense that we don't get the opportunity to make meaningful contributions into our relationships. Every aspect of our lives start to revolve around our treatment and care, leaving little space for us to branch out and offer care and support to others. Eventually, we end up becoming chronic ""recipients,"" if you will. Over time, that can wear down our sense of self, even leading to a crisis of identity as being a ""pain care recipient"" becomes our primary role.

Find things that you can do for the people you care about (within your limitations). That might mean being there to offer advice, painting them a picture, knitting them a blanket, watching a movie together

**6. Up your supplement game**

Taking supplements can help to improve pain symptoms, reduce inflammation and support calmness. Check with your doctor before adding any supplements to your regimen to ensure that they don‚Äôt interact with your medications.

As an example, here are the supplements I currently take and what I take them for:

|Supplement Name|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|R-alpha lipoic acid|Suppressing nerve pain, supporting blood sugar, enhancing cognition; R-ala is considered to be more bioavailable than regulara ALA. I take the Jarrow supplement. I consider them trustworthy since the pharmacies I used to work in would regularly order from them.|
|Acetyl l-carnitine|Enhancing cognition, fighting brain fog, boosting metabolism; I take Jarrow for this one too.|
|CoQ10|Reducing inflammation, suppressing nerve pain, supporting blood sugar, enhancing metabolism; I like the Doctor's Best one.|
|Nicotinamide Riboside / NMN|I previously [wrote up a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1drq8cv/found_a_supplement_that_may_be_helping_my_nerve/) about using this supplement for nerve pain; I like Basis and Signal by Elysium Health.|
|Fish oil|Reduce inflammation, improve heart health, enhance cognition and memory|
|Multivitamin|Avoid deficiencies like low vitamin D and iron|
|Hyaluronic acid|Reduce inflammation and cushion joints, supports glowing skin as well; I like Jarrow|
|Docusate|Avoid getting constipated. Works alongside a laxative or Rx therapy to ""soften things up,"" so that those therapies can work better. I take 250-500 mg/day.|
|Probiotic|Support digestion and blood sugar; I like Glucose Control by Pendulum|
|Collagen|Reduce joint pain and inflammation|

**7. If lifestyle adjustments aren‚Äôt helping enough, consider researching medical options**

Sometimes, even the most meaningful lifestyle changes aren't helpful enough to work through depression. In that case, consider talking to a doctor. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1h4l4tp/how_to_care_for_your_mental_health_and_have_your/) lists online services that provide low-cost medical mental health evaluations and medication management. A few of the most common depresion treatments include:

**Modafinil / Armodafinil** \- This option is a personal favorite of mine because it can be safely combined with other medications (i.e. opioids). Modafinil and armodafinil are mild stimulants that up-regulate dopamine to reduce chronic fatigue while enhancing mood and cognition. Either of them may be a viable option for those avoiding SSRIs/SNRIs.

**SNRIs** \- These medications play a dual role in both blocking pain signals from reaching the brain and treating different types of depression. The most commonly prescribed is Cymbalta (duloxetine). More recently, Savella (milnacipran) has emerged and is more commonly associated with weight loss compared to others that can sometimes cause weight gain. Effexor (venlafaxine) and Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) are also commonly prescribed SNRIs.

**SSRIs** \- Common examples include Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Celexa (citalopram). these are what most people think of as typical antidepressants.

**Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)** \- Common examples include amitriptyline and nortriptyline. These medications are used to treat chronic nerve pain as well as depression.

(Please not that this is not an exhaustive list of all antidepressant therapies. Talk with your doctor if you're interested in exploring options.)

**8. Consider trying out part-time remote work (if able)**

Earning money feels good. It can offer a greater sense of control over our lives and more discretionary income to spend on things we want and need. For many of us, this may be a long-term goal to work our way up to. For some of us, it's simply not an option (and that's ok). Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like advice finding a remote job. I transitioned to remote work 8 years ago and have accumulated over 12 years experience working in the software space. To me, my job is a good distraction from pain and helps me stick to a routine. It has also allowed me to meet a lot of new friends, grow a career path, and find a renewed sense of purpose.

I hope that these ideas have been informative and helpful. Please bear in mind that some things on this list represent my personal experience and may not be relevant to everyone who reads this. For medical advice, always reach out to your doctor.

1hn1f72,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hn1f72/aitah_if_i_kick_my_sister_out_over_coffee/,AITAH if I kick my sister out over coffee? ,"

My sister (34) and I (38) have a decent relationship. Sometimes we‚Äôre best friends, and other times we can‚Äôt stand each other. It‚Äôs always been that way since we were kids. My father passed away 11 years ago, leaving us with the responsibility of taking care of our special needs brother (39). At the time, we lived in NYC, and getting services for the disabled  takes a long time. While we were working on getting services for him, my sister, brother, and I lived together in the apartment we grew up in. My sister and I argued all the time, and I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, so I moved out, knowing she wouldn‚Äôt. I found an apartment in New Jersey, in a nice neighborhood, close to my family and work, so it was perfect for me. I lived blissfully on my own for two years until the problems started.

My brother lost his job, and my sister was left with the responsibility of paying the full rent by herself. If anyone lives in NYC, you know how expensive it is, and rents have skyrocketed. My sister was struggling to pay the rent alone, and the landlord stopped maintaining the apartment. I felt guilty because I had moved out and left her with my brother. My brother doesn‚Äôt require much care beyond being prompted to take care of his basic needs‚Äîmaking doctor appointments, paying taxes, taking medication, and managing the money our father left him. He had a job that helped pay his portion of the rent when I left, so I thought everything was fine. My sister didn‚Äôt have to do much because I was still helping, but I still felt guilty, so I offered for them to stay with me until they found a cheaper place.

I thought it was a good idea at the time because my brother had a better chance of getting the services he needed in New Jersey. It turned out to be the worst mistake I ever made. Problems started with how messy they were. They didn‚Äôt like cleaning up after themselves, and after a while, my apartment had a rodent problem because of how messy and disgusting they could be. My sister‚Äôs inconsiderate nature made it even more uncomfortable for me, leading to huge blow-ups about her behavior. During this time, we were working on getting my brother the services he needed, and she was looking for a place to stay.

My brother found another job and was able to help with the rent, and my sister found a place that was perfect for them, but she couldn‚Äôt get it because her credit was terrible, and my brother didn‚Äôt have any credit. So, they had to stay with me until her credit improved and my brother built his credit. My apartment was meant for one person, and with them being messy, it made the apartment feel even smaller. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, so I decided to move out and let them stay in the apartment while I went on sabbatical in South America. I was tired of the arguments, the toxicity, and the messiness, so I gave up my apartment to them.

I enjoyed my time in South America for a while, but after three months, my sister called, crying, saying she was tired of being the one living with our brother and dealing with all the responsibilities. Mind you, he was paying his half of the rent, had a job, and cooked his own food. The only responsibility she had was helping him make appointments for his services, which she had neglected. She expressed resentment that I left, even though I was technically forced out because of the living situation. My sister was upset that my brother got fired again, and I felt guilty again for leaving her to pay the full rent. So, I cut my sabbatical short and came back. But the situation did not improve when I returned.

My once clean apartment was a mess, and my brother was being neglected because my sister acted as though he didn‚Äôt live there. I started a cleaning business so my brother could make some money while looking for another job. That was another mistake, but I soon realized how difficult it was for him to keep a job due to his developmental delays. I began working on getting his services back on track, making sure he made his appointments, and finally got him a caseworker who was a godsend. She helped him get his own apartment, a new job, and a Home Health Aide who loves him like a brother. We got lucky.

During the time I was away til my brother moved into his apartment, my sister had been working on improving her credit. By the time he moved into his apartment, her credit had improved drastically. She had saved enough money to pay the deposit and first and second months' rent, so she was set. The plan was for my sister to move out six months after my brother moved, but it‚Äôs been a year, and she still hasn‚Äôt made any progress. There‚Äôs always an excuse for why she can‚Äôt move. Our arguments haven‚Äôt improved, and despite promising to change her behavior, nothing has gotten better.

Today, it came to a head. I‚Äôve had enough. I‚Äôve sacrificed too much‚ÄîI gave up my sabbatical, a job in Hawaii, peace in my home, and recently, even my renovated living room to her dog. I have no privacy, and the only time I get for myself is when I‚Äôm at work. I sleep on the couch while she sleeps in my bedroom and refuses to leave. Today, I got upset because I wanted to stay home from work and just decompress, but she decided to stay home too  and interrupted my peace  to talk about nothing. Afterward, she made herself coffee and breakfast and didn‚Äôt offer me anything. I got annoyed and told her it would be nice if she considered me for once.

I know this seems like a small thing, but it‚Äôs part of a long history of her selfishness and inconsiderate behavior. I‚Äôve made myself uncomfortable for her, given her most of the space in the apartment, came back when I didn‚Äôt want to, and even let her bring a sick dog into my home, which I didn‚Äôt want but felt compelled to help take care of. I‚Äôve done enough, and I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end. Her not offering me a cup of coffee was the last straw. I don‚Äôt want to give up my life for my siblings anymore, and I don‚Äôt think my sister will move out unless I push her to. I told her she had until February to leave, and she said she would leave only if I pay her the rent she‚Äôs already paid while living here. She doesn‚Äôt pay for electricity, and she recently stopped paying the phone bill, leaving everything to me. I don‚Äôt want to take her to court. I can‚Äôt leave because I missed out on a job in Hawaii, and this is my apartment. Why should I leave when I did all the work and paid for everything to secure this place? I don‚Äôt want to leave because I love my apartment, and she won‚Äôt be able to pay the rent on her own, so she‚Äôll be forced to leave anyway if I move out.

1hn1c6f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hn1c6f,Sticky center in Goat's Milk Soap,"#1 should be the recipe I used, and am having issues with. I replaced the water with Goat's Milk and adding TiO2 at 1% total weight. I am having a couple issues and I'm not sure what I need to change. I mixed at just about 100 degrees. I know it's in ounces, but I'm weighing it by oz, not using fluid oz. The issues I'm having is it gets to trace within 30 seconds. Also I demolded at about 24 hrs, forgot about it and cut it at 1 week later and the centers were super sticky. Like, sticking to the cutter and leaving trailing marks on the bars. I used a 6 individual pocket square bar mold and cut those bars to check the inside and get a rough idea of what a loaf bar would look like. It also had a lot of soda ash on the clay or Charcoal additives. I tried 6 different additives, one per try. Charcoal, rose clay & rose hips, coffee grounds and different mica colors to see how they looked. All the Lilac micas turned grayish Lilac or an off putting pink. If you have any tips for a mica that makes a great Lilac I would love that. 

#2 is a tweak of the first since it was getting to trace too fast. I got rid of the soy and used less palm oil and flakes. It took longer to trace which was nice. Mixed at under 100 degrees, maybe 90? Also replaced water with Goat's Milk and added TiO2. Haven't demolded yet. I am hoping these tweaks work, but would love some insight. 

#3 is the first recipe I used, which is the same as the 1st picture but basically double. It took longer to trace and was a really nice bar when I used it at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year (even better then). It wasn't sticky when demolding and cutting after 48 hrs using a loaf mold. No soda ash or gelling, which is what i wanted. Also replaced water with Goat's Milk and added TiO2. 

As far as I can tell, no issues with the fragrance oils causing anything. I think that covers everything? It's mostly the sticky issue I'm having issues with. ",1,1735256375.0,soapmaking,1,1.0,False

She ends the exchange by telling me she has no food and little money left for the month.

Mom: I'm out of food


Me:What do you mean you're out of food?




Mom: I'm out of my food I bought. Just some burgers and a Mac n cheese left. Food is very expensive. I have a little bit of money left.




Me: Yeah I know food is expensive. So you do have food. Just maybe not what you want right now. I'm sorry 




Mom:No, it's fineI can always eat their food. I won't starve.




Me:Do you need more money?




Mom:No, thank you



Then today I proceeded to bring a huge bag of string cheese and a charcuterie plate of Italian meats. A bunch of fancy cinnamon rolls and a coffee cake and two huge bottles of oberwise milk one whole, one chocolate.

  
My mom proceeded to act surprised at all the food and questioned why I brought it.

1hn19xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hn19xh/aitah_for_suggesting_my_sister_stay_home_because/,AITAH for suggesting my sister stay home because her partner was ill and she herself was experiencing nausea? ,"

I (40f) made christmas plans with my parents (66f) (68m)for them to come over for both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Christmas day, they would stay until 3 pm because they had a 3 and a half hour ride home.  

A few days before christmas Eve, my sister (33f) (we haven't been on best terms) asked my mother what her plans were. My mother told me about this, so despite my strained relationship with my sister (figured it's time to let things go and make peace), I said I would invite her for christmas day and did. She said yes, and the plans were made. 

We were originally going to do Chinese for dinner on christmas day but changed it once my sister was coming over because my parents said they would treat but changed it to me going half. (not my sister) We ended up buying a bunch of food to cook instead since that would be nicer. Christmas eve went smooth and my parents stayed in a hotel because that is what they like to do. 

The following day is where the disaster began. My parents were suppose to come at 9 am as the kids (19f,11m,8f,7f,) were waiting for them to open their presents under the tree and my mom loves watching and being involved. At 10 am i called my mom and this is where it all really started I informed my mother that my sister would not be making it over because her partner was ill throwing up since 4 am. I thought it was best since she was also nauseous (though not throwing up) she stay home and we make plans for another day when they aren't feeling ill. Mind you at this point it's been an hour and my mom had not even reached out to me about being late or anything.  

My mother totally lost it and flipped out on me. She went off the handle, screaming on the phone how she was just going to go home. I ended the call here. 

It should also be noted that my sister later showed me a text where our mother was telling my sister to come to her house at 2 instead of 4. My sister told her lets make it later so you can still spend time with your daughter and grandkids.

A few minutes later she kept repeatedly calling me, my husband and daughter, we didn't answer because we were trying to enjoy christmas with the kids. Like 15 min later i called my father because I felt at this point she was out of line and I had every right to inform my sister it's best since their sick that they stay home.  I hear my mother immediately yelling again. 

My father tells me they have to come to my house because after driving around all morning, no restaurants were open, and my mom needed to eat. It's a routine for them they always get breakfast out before coming to our house when they stay a night. My mother just likes eating out and uses any reason to do so even though I'm perfectly capable and willing to make food. So I agree and let her come. Apparently, they stopped at 7 11 to get eggs as if I didn't have any... I really don't know why she does these things it feels insulting. So they both eat and she was upset the kids already opened the gifts when she said she wasnt coming and was already over an hour past 9 am, and then rushes to leave so they can get home by 4 for my sister to instead come to their house. 

Basically just blowing me and my family off, leaving us with no christmas plans. They left in such a rush my oldest didn't even get to give her her christmas gift.  My oldest, who is 19, was upset, and my younger kids were upset too. I felt this was extremely disrespectful and rude. I feel like they just came to eat and take their chicken back that was going to be cooked today and take leftover ham for my sister. And all of this because I didn't want someone knowingly sick in my house. So instead of staying until 3 on christmas day and arriving at 9 am, they rushed to leave and left by 11ish am and first arrived 10 30 ish. She also had already celebrated the holidays with my sister a few weeks proir leaving us with no plans. We could have had my fil over for christmas day but didn't because they were suppose to be here and my mother doesn't really like him and my husband doesn't think he's really comfortable around them. Edit to add i should have said we could have invited my fil over for christmas day but it's highly unlikely he actually would have came because he's taking care of the aunt who can't travel at all and lives far away. He actually didn't even call today to wish the kids a merry Christmas he's very busy with what's going on in his life, and I try to be understanding of it. 

2 hours after she leaves she messages me saying the hot chocolate and other coffees she brought to my home and told my oldest daughter were for her, were for my sister. 

AIW for feeling my mother disrespected my family and myself with her actions?

1hn19u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1hn19u6/crush_on_best_friend_advice_needed/,"Crush on best friend, advice needed","I'm a freshman in college and back in September I met this girl in one of my classes. We talked a bit and I thought she was really nice and I started to develop a crush on her. As the semester went on, we started naturally hanging out more and our friendship progressed to the point where we became best friends. We started playing video games, watching movies, and going out for food together, just the two of us. 

I wanted to confess my feelings for her really badly, but I wanted to be absolutely sure that she had the same feelings for me. Things would happen that could indicate that she was into me, but I started to doubt because she would bring up things about another guy friend that could possibly indicate she was into him, even though she and I would hang out way more than her and him.

One day I asked her if she liked him and if she would consider asking him out, and she said she didn't know if she liked him, but that she definitely would not ask him out because she's had bad relationships in the past and is not ready for another one yet. Her and I have gotten comfortable sharing our baggage and secrets with each other, so I know exactly what relationships she's talking about and I completely understand why she wouldn't want to try dating again yet. 

Not too long before I asked her this, she set me up with one of her friends and we got coffee together. We talked and I thought she was really nice, but I don't want to date her. I still have a crush on my other friend and love spending time with her. I completely understand and respect that she doesn't want to date anyone right now, but I don't want to date anyone else either because I am scared to death that we will grow apart, and I don't want to lose her as my friend. On the other hand, I am worried that when she eventually decides she wants to date again and dates someone else that her and I will grow apart anyway.

Although I realize dating her is off the table for right now, what should I do?  Should I have an open and honest conversation with her about how much our friendship means to me and why I don't want to date other girls? Should I bring up and openly discuss the possibility of being more than friends at some point in the future?

Short Story by

A William Benitez

Turning twelve, soon to be a teen, I expected to be having more fun with the other guys in the neighborhood. My dreams were playing on weekends and spending my summer vacations at the beach.

But that was not to be. Dad had other plans. He decided it was time for me to learn the construction business, which meant working every Saturday, some Sundays and all summer long.

Then my dad bought a property near the beach where we built a house. I thought for sure we would use it for vacations. But no, it was a rental. We spent a couple of weeks there every summer only to do all the needed maintenance. Sometimes I was lucky and got in a swim in the late afternoon.

Once I graduated from high school, my dad‚Äôs plan was to make me a 60/40 partner in the business. When my twelfth-grade art teacher encouraged me to attend art school, my dad crushed that idea immediately, lecturing that all artists were bums.

My dad‚Äôs not entirely to be blamed. I was eighteen and had all the skills necessary to make a fair living. I could have stood up and followed my path. I just didn‚Äôt have the guts. So, I ended up in an unprofitable partnership with someone who knew how to work and dish out insults. It was an awful situation.

One day I confronted him. ‚ÄúOn the last eight jobs, you say we haven‚Äôt made one penny of profit. Why the hell are we in business if not for profit?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I have made no profit either,‚Äù my father shouted.

‚ÄúYou expect that to make me feel better? Shouldn‚Äôt we make a profit on every job? You said we are 60/40 partners but 40% of nothing is nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt argue with you. Profit or no profit, you got a paycheck, didn‚Äôt you? I‚Äôm going home.‚Äù He turned back to his truck, but then hesitated for a moment.

‚ÄúYou want everything to be peaches and cream, but business isn‚Äôt like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúBusiness isn‚Äôt like what? A business owner sells a job, does the work and figures in profit. What the hell is peaches and cream about that?‚Äù

He walked away. I watched his back but decided not to say anything else. It would be a waste of time, anyway. I walked to my truck and started the drive home.

$120.00 a week. $120 for six full days was not enough. I had not had one raise since I started working for him full time four years ago right out of high school. He had said we would be partners. Morgan and Son partnership! What a joke! I had all the headaches of running a full-time business on a carpenter‚Äôs salary. And it wasn‚Äôt even a talented carpenter‚Äôs salary; I could start with Nichols Construction anytime, with a salary of $150.00 working only five days a week. Saturdays and Sundays would be mine for a change.

I wanted to leave. Ten long years, since age twelve, when I started working Saturdays and most Sundays when we were busy, I had worked with him, every Saturday and many Sundays, while in school. Did I say ‚Äúwith‚Äù him? No, you don‚Äôt work with John Morgan, you work for him. No sports, no beach, no free fun times while I was in school.

I needed more money. Sandra had just given birth to our son, and we were still in a bedroom apartment. I wanted to build a home but couldn‚Äôt afford it.

My dad still treated me like a child. The partnership thing was bullshit. I had to leave even if there were repercussions, an inevitability.

Sandra was sitting on the terrace with Jeremy in her arms when I drove up.

‚ÄúHi Hon, how are you?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúO.K., how was your day?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask. How‚Äôs the champ?‚Äù

Sandra smiled. ‚ÄúThe champ is fine. Why shouldn‚Äôt I ask about your day?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me get a beer first. I need one.‚Äù

I walked to the kitchen and came back and sat in the chaise lounge without a word.

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Sandra persisted.

‚ÄúHuh‚Äîwhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúDavid, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúI had another argument with my dad.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no. What was it this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúSame old thing, completed another job with no profits.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot on this one, too? He had said you would clear more than $500.00.‚Äù

‚ÄúSlight miscalculation, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess the argument ended the same as usual,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYeah, he walked away as usual, not caring about what I said.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs hard, but I wish you wouldn‚Äôt argue with your dad so often.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, do you think I want to? Today I came up with a great idea to save time and muscle while cutting rafters and guess what he said.‚Äù

She shook her head.

‚ÄúHe said it proved that any idiot could come up with a good idea. I can‚Äôt go on working for him. Besides not making money I‚Äôm owed, I have to take the insults. I‚Äôm going to leave him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll break his heart.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about my heart?‚Äù I have to work some place where I‚Äôm respected and can also make a good living. Eventually, I‚Äôll get my license and set up my construction business.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hate for you and your dad to have a falling out over money.‚Äù

‚ÄúSandra, it‚Äôs gone way beyond money now. I can no longer stay where I‚Äôm not respected.‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember David, you told me yourself that he taught you everything you know about construction.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, does that mean I have to take his insults? Now he‚Äôs learning from me. Of course, he‚Äôll never admit that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Honey,‚Äù Sandra just lowered her head, and the discussion ended, but I realized in that moment that what I had endured all these years was abuse.

The rest of the week dragged by until finally Saturday afternoon arrived. My dad returned from his home with the paychecks and distributed them to the other men. He called me over to his truck.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your check, Son.‚Äù He paused and then in a serious tone continued.

‚ÄúI want to talk to you. I think you should take more responsibility on the job.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore responsibility? Are you kidding? I do everything but handle the money and calculate the jobs which you won‚Äôt allow me to do. I know I could do better than you. We would make a profit if I handled the business.‚Äù

My father backed up and raised his hands. He spoke in a calm voice, condescending but calm.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for anger. I‚Äôm just trying to make you a better contractor.‚Äù

‚ÄúA better contractor? I‚Äôm no damn contractor. Contractors make money. They don‚Äôt work for a salary, a low salary like mine.‚Äù

Suddenly he changed into the real dad and shouted, ‚Äúall you think about is money.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn right! I don‚Äôt work for the exercise. I can get it at the gym. I work for money to do things I want to do, like building a home for my family and saving for my son‚Äôs education.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour son is still a baby, and your apartment is fine for now.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy son‚Äôs education and the size of my home are none of your business. I will make those decisions with no advice from you. From now on, you stay the hell out of my life.‚Äù

I rushed to my truck, cranked it up, and skidded away. As always, he wanted to control me and my life. My desires were of no interest to him. Another lousy week had ended with no solutions or profit.

That night, I was still angry when we went to bed. Sandra tried to console me, but I wasn‚Äôt receptive. My sleep was fitful and by 5:30 Sunday morning, I was having my coffee. Today would be the day. I had made my decision. I would tell him this morning.

Sandra awoke at 8:15 and came looking for me.

‚ÄúHow long have you been up?‚Äù

‚ÄúSince 5:30 but awake most of the night. I can‚Äôt sleep until I tell my dad that I‚Äôm quitting the business.‚Äù

‚ÄúToday?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight now. He‚Äôll be at the shop by now. Sundays are just another day for him. I‚Äôm not delaying what must be done.

‚ÄúDavid, are you sure? Are you ready to go on your own? We need that money.‚Äù

I had expected more support than this.

‚ÄúBelieve it or not, Sandra, I‚Äôm already a better contractor than he‚Äôs ever been. Besides, Nichols Construction has already offered me $150.00 for five days a week until I get my license. I‚Äôll make more money and have Saturdays and Sundays to spend with you and Jeremy.‚Äù

‚ÄúDavid, what about your dad's feelings?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about mine? All he needed to do was pay me a fair salary and give me the profit he‚Äôs promised. If he really gave a damn about me and our partnership, he would have done that. I‚Äôm taking care of me and my family.‚Äù

Sandra showed her misgivings, but she didn‚Äôt try to change my mind. I could see she was worried, but I was too busy thinking about facing my father to comfort her.

I left and drove to my father‚Äôs shop, slowly and in silence. I knew this was going to be unpleasant, but I also knew my well-being was at stake. I parked in front of the shop and sat silently for several minutes, planning my words. No need for any more delays. The time was now.

Despite being scared, the built-up anger far surpassed my fear.

I walked into the shop. My father was standing in front of a workbench.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here today? We don‚Äôt have any jobs going.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has nothing to do with a job. I have to talk to you, and it can‚Äôt wait.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat could be so important that it couldn‚Äôt wait till Monday?‚Äù He said, studying me like I was a bug in a jar.

Finally, I faced him directly.

‚ÄúWell, what‚Äôs so damn important?‚Äù he said, almost as a shout.

I hesitated a moment and cleared my throat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm quitting today.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve taken all the disrespect that I can. I can‚Äôt take any more insults. I can‚Äôt take any more low pay. It‚Äôs time for me to quit and go into business for myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a license,‚Äù he shouted.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the test and get my license. I don‚Äôt want or need your help.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are you planning to support your family in the meantime?‚Äù His tone was sarcastic and nasty.

That‚Äôs when I lost it. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs none of your damn business. But just so you know, I‚Äôm going to work for Nichols Construction until I get my license. He‚Äôll pay me more for fewer hours. I have off Saturdays. And he shows me respect.‚Äù

‚ÄúNichols is an idiot.‚Äù He yelled.

‚ÄúWell, he has a successful business that makes a profit on every job.‚Äù

His face swelled with anger. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre still on that profit kick. Is that what brought this on? And you think you can be in business for yourself, making a profit? You‚Äôll see, being in business is no picnic.‚Äù

‚ÄúA picnic? How can you be in business for four years and not make a profit? Maybe you're just not sharing your profits with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you insinuating?‚Äù He shouted. ‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôm stealing money from you?‚Äù

My father‚Äôs face was red. I had seen him angry on more occasions than I care to remember, but I‚Äôd never seen him this angry. I lowered my voice to just above a whisper.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the hell you are doing. I know that I‚Äôm a partner who never makes a profit. The reason isn‚Äôt important. I just wanted my share. Since there aren‚Äôt any, I‚Äôm going elsewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo ahead, be on your own. You‚Äôll fall flat on your face and come crawling back. Go on, get out of here.‚Äù He waved his fists.

I paused and then smiled. ‚ÄúYou know better than that. I won‚Äôt fail and if I do, I will live in a dumpster before coming back to work for you.‚Äù

I walked out of the door and to the truck with the Morgan and Son sign on the door. I got in, clenched the steering wheel, and breathed easier than I had in years.

When I got home Sandra asked, ‚ÄúDid you tell him?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I finally told him, and he told me to get out.‚Äù

Oh, no David.‚Äù

I knew I would get pressure from family members.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your father. Respect your father,‚Äù crap like that.

My reply would be, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm his son. A son needs respect as well.‚Äù

On Monday I began working for the Nichols Construction company. As agreed, they paid me more and sent me on most jobs alone because I had the experience and all the tools. Within a month, I had my Class C Contractor's license and could take on building homes and small commercial buildings.

I immediately opened a checking account in the name of David Morgan Construction and kept the business money separate by paying myself a salary that went into our personal bank account. A lesson learned.

Within the year my dad and I began speaking to one another, cordially and with respect. We never once discussed business. He never asked me how my business was going and I left it at that.",1,1735255518.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Just six months ago, I was Mr. Henderson, landlord, owner of three perfectly respectable apartment buildings. Now? I‚Äôm just another guy under a bridge, albeit one with a slightly more‚Ä¶ refined vocabulary.

It started subtly. A late payment here, a partial payment there. Excuses piled up faster than unpaid invoices. ‚ÄúMy cat had surgery,‚Äù one would say. ‚ÄúUnexpected car trouble,‚Äù another would claim. The excuses were creative, I‚Äôll give them that. But creativity doesn‚Äôt pay the mortgage. It doesn‚Äôt pay the water bill. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt pay for the repairs that started piling up as funds dried to a trickle.

I tried everything. Payment plans, gentle reminders, even the occasional sternly worded letter. Nothing worked. The rent simply stopped coming. Foreclosure notices arrived like unwelcome Christmas cards. And then, the eviction notice ‚Äì for me.

Now, my world is defined by the thin nylon of my tent, pitched precariously close to the riverbank. I‚Äôve even fashioned a little sign, propped up against a rusty coffee can: ‚ÄúTips for a Former Landlord.‚Äù It‚Äôs a long shot, but sometimes tenants from the neighboring complexes, the ones I used to manage, will toss in a few coins. A small act of‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ guilt? Pity? I‚Äôll take it.

The worst part, besides the constant damp chill that seeps into my bones, is the hunger. Utter, gnawing hunger. I‚Äôve resorted to‚Ä¶ well, scavenging. My old tenants, bless their vegan hearts, stocked their fridges with tofu, kale, and other things I wouldn‚Äôt have touched with a ten-foot pole before. Now, it‚Äôs a lifeline. I sneak into the buildings at night, a ghost in the hallways I used to own, and pilfer whatever I can find. Raw broccoli has become a delicacy. I never thought I‚Äôd miss a good steak so much. The lack of protein is taking its toll. My hair is thinning, my muscles are wasting away. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm developing some kind of acute malnutrition.

The sun is setting, casting long, skeletal shadows across the muddy ground. Another night. Another bout of shivering, another pang of hunger. I pull my threadbare blanket tighter around me, the faint smell of kale clinging to it. This isn't how things were supposed to be. I was a landlord, a provider. Now, I‚Äôm just another statistic, another casualty of a system that, ironically, I used to be a part of.

Fellow landchads, I‚Äôve found myself in an‚Ä¶ unusual situation. Due to widespread non-payment of rent, I am now experiencing homelessness. I am relying on‚Ä¶ unconventional methods of sustenance. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Any practical solutions for surviving on stolen vegan food and the occasional handful of change? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",3,1735255331.0,LoveForLandchads,3,1.0,False
1hn0z86,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1hn0z86/out_laws_frustrations_crap_grandparents/,Out laws frustrations - crap grandparents ,"Hi, 

What does one do with toxic in-laws?

Backstory, me and my wife got pregnant 6 years ago and we lived 45 mins from her parents (2 hours from mine) we both commuted at the time for work and it wasn't an issue. 

When my future (now current) in laws found out my wife was pregnant they made her life hell saying we needed to move closer to them for 6 months, as we'd need the 'family support' which led to us moving within 5 mins of them to a much more expensive area and my wife having a stressful pregnancy and us moving a month before her due date in Dec 2018. 

Fast forward over the next 5 years we've now had another child now both 5 and 3, both beautiful girls and I love my family. We have had no support from our in-laws who one is retired and other is working 2 days a week. We've had more support from my parents who live two hours away. 

My wife has struggled a lot with the load, I've struggled with the extra financial pressure living in a more expensive area whilst I've also been lucky working for a good company where I could take advantage of flexible working and able to take days off at short notice to support my young family. 

My wife has had a few deep chats with her parents usually when she's asking where her 'village' is and her parents commited to have the girls for a sleep over once a month so we could have a date night or just an early night and lay in. 

The last time this happened after the chat in Feb 24 was my birthday in march. Even then the following morning her passive aggressive father text her at 8:30 to let her know they were going to a local park and 9 and would drop the children back at 9:30. And the previous time he arranged to meet some scatty friends for a coffee on the Sunday morning at 9am to ensure we'd pick them up.

My wife's mum has keep saying for the last 2 years she would like to spend more time with my youngest before she starts school next September, she has done nothing about it.

Deep down they're nice people. But anything my wife says or asks her mum she says I'll ask your dad. She's a grown 60 year old woman. He just sits on his backside watching sport on TV. 

I recently got a new job, which involves the odd night away they're more bothered how it will affect them than the long term positive affects it will have on my family. Anything positive we do is met with passive aggressive comments. We live within 10 minute drive of all of her family and see mine more. We just get invited to Christmas and birthdays to make it seem like we're a family and whenever we're all together all they talk about is their lives 20/30 years ago when my children are now in that moment they are they don't show any interest in my kids just live in the past. 

We pop round but feel unwelcome. But her brother who's wife left him for a short period last year who lives 10 mins away, has 3 cousins to my children has a really narcissistic wife who has caused trouble for the whole family over the course of their 15 year relationship. They only see them at birthdays, Easter and Christmas when he calls they roll out the red carpet. Which I understand as he's their son but for my wife I think she feels abandoned as she's the one making the effort with them but gets pushed a side all the time by them.

Sorry for this being so long but I'm truly useless with women and terrible with emotions and working stuff out for myself. I'd like some input to see if I'm barking up the wrong tree or there's something more going on.

So I (m35) am a father of 2 youngster and I'm separated from my wife for about 15 months. It was my choice as I was really unhappy, It was a hard decision but it really had gone toxic and we were just arguing all the time, But we're civil now thankfully for the kids.

When me and my ex wife were still together we had a close relationship with her best friend (f35) who we shall call X. Our kids went to school together and we were all pretty close, before you starting to think it, nothing was going on and I always made sure I was never in a 1 on 1 situation with her by myself for optics, I also never got the feeling there was anything more than friendship going on. Not long before me and my wife separated X's relationship with her boyfriend (not her kids dad) ended and he left her in pretty bad circumstances so me and my ex wife stepped in to help. X needed to sell the house as she couldn't afford it anymore, her ex had left the place in a state with lots of unfished work. I'm a builder and I offered to do the work and completed it all for free in my spare days between jobs. As a result X said she was forever indebted to me and began to cook me meals once a week. I said she didn't need to but she insisted and after me and my wife separated this continued. She would leave them on the door step of where I started living. My friends all comment on how odd this is and would tell me more there's more to it. We kept in contact and bumped into each other every now and then.

Fast forward to May of this year, I was at a bar in the area and I bumped into her and her mum, who I also know quite well. We spent a good bit of the evening chatting over drinks and when it came time to leave I walked them both home as they both live along the same route I was taking. When we dropped her mum off and was out of site of the her front door, X immediately told me to slow down and held my hand as we walked, I was shocked, It felt good but I froze for a moment as I really didn't expect it, I was worried someone might see us and it was all still a bit fresh with my ex so I let go and put my hands in my pockets, she linked arms with me and we continued towards her house. The entire way she spoke about how I was such a great guy and my ex wife was an idiot for letting me go ect ect but said she felt guilty about talking to me and she was worried about my ex wife finding out, she explained she sometimes ignores my messages because of it. I reminded her that nothing had happened between us, we've not exchanged any inappropriate messages I said that was stupid for her to ignore me as my ex wife would never had access to those messaged anyway. When we arrived at her house we chatted for about 20 mins outside but her mum kept phoning her , I presume to check X had gotten home, or maybe she knows that X might like me? but X kept ignoring her. Eventually she said she really has to answer her phone and we parted with a peck on each others cheek. It felt good, I felt like we really connected.

The following week after that happened it was her daughters birthday, who I've been close to from the beginning, her dad is a loser and I've always tried to be a positive male role model for her as she doesn't have any in her life.  I thought it would be a good idea to send some flowers to the house for her daughters  birthday, one bunch for her daughter and one bunch for X with a message just saying it was from me. X immediately messaged me the minute they arrived thanking me saying I shouldn't have and it really made her day, I replied basically saying that its was the least I could do and asked if she wanted to go for a drink some time to catch up, she ignored the reply and went into offline mode or blocked me. I was pretty confused and a little hurt so I decided to leave it but she still continued to make me meals once a week after a short hiatus, leave them on my doorstep whilst I was at work and continue to message me and then ignore my messages. We continued to exchange the odd message and pass each other but didn't really have another close moment like that, I tried to instigate more with her but it never emerged, so I kind of brushed it off and continued living my life.

At the beginning of Dec I did the school run in the morning which is rare for me and I saw X for the first time in about 2 months.  I was watching my youngest playing with a friend when I heard X's daughter and turned around to see both of them walking straight behind me like I wasn't there, I thought it was odd, I'm a 6ft 4 and stick out like a sore thumb at the best of times let alone in a school playground. I was just sorting my youngest out to go into class when X turned around, looked at me and then completely blanked me. I was pretty annoyed and I was just going to let it go but after getting my kid into class I thought ""no fuck that, that's just plain rude"". I caught her up and called out without saying her name, she immediately turned around and knew it was me, I said ""what's going on? did you not see me"" and she paused for a moment before making up a story about not seeing me which I knew was bullshit as I saw her look directly at me. We walked and talked the short distance to where we were both parked and she was parked directing nose to nose with my van that has my name and business plastered all over it backing up my theory of her bullshitting me. I asked her if she wanted to go grab a coffee at the caf√© around the corner that has just opened as we were both just talking about it, she didn't decline or acknowledge it so I left it at that and continued on my day. The following week she messaged me and we ended up exchanging messages all night and I found out that she's single hardly talks to or see's my ex wife anymore so I told her that if she needs anything she only needs to ask especially with the time of year as she doesn't have anyone to ask as her dad died a few years ago. We messaged most days for the next week or so and then all of a sudden she stopped blanked my messages again but I can see she was online.

I really don't get WTF is going on. I know her quite well and she isn't the game playing type. Is she interested in me or what? is she worried about my ex wife? why does she keep blowing hot and cold?. I'm no sap either and wouldn't let myself get friend zoned.

Thanks for reading this far. I get that I should just ask her outright what the frig is going on but I want to do it in person and not over a message where she has the opportunity to ignore it.

edit: I'd like to add that just writing this felt kind of therapeutic for me, like a giant unload. Also I have had 2 brief flings since leaving my ex wife so it's not like I'm desperately holding out for X or anything. I just find it slim pickings in my age group and I don't really make a connection with them.",1,1735255285.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1hn0x4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hn0x4z/aio_for_feeling_condescended_and_disrespected_by/,AIO for feeling condescended and disrespected by my sister?,"I (26F) am home for Christmas with my sister Ella (19F). She has always been a bit condescending towards me, but I am also prideful and care a lot about my reputation, so that colours my opinion, especially because she is my baby sister and I had a caring role for her as a teenager, so I don't like feeling spoken down to by her. I also struggle a lot with Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria, which can colour my opinions. Anyway, there are 4 incidents where I feel I may be overreacting:

1. I was trying to get our older sister Lee, who is 30 and has complex learning difficulties, into the dining room so she wouldn't get in the way of us prepping and bringing out dinner. I had her sitting in the dining room where Ella was sorting out music. I told Lee, ""here, just sit down and help Ella with the music"", to which Ella replied ""just let her do what she wants"". Normally, when Ella interjects like this, I tend to just stop as I don't want to cause a scene. Anyway, Lee wandered into the kitchen and got in the way a bit. I off-handedly mentioned this at dinner (yes this was petty of me), saying ""well I had Lee in here, then Ella told me to stop"". Ella said it was because I was giving Lee ""too many instructions"", then claimed I said something I never said. When I said I didn't say that, all I said was ""sit down and help Ella with music"", she leaned and whispered ""will you take a chill pill already?""

Context; I have also had a strong caring role for Lee, at one point literally being paid by the government to be her carer. I do think I know how to take care of Lee, and since Ella tends to be quite short with her, I do not think she does. As I said, I wanted her in the dining room so we could get on with dinner and Lee could relax.

2. Same dinner as outlined above; shortly after Lee wandered back into the kitchen I saw Ella sitting in what looked like a very uncomfortable position. I asked her what she was doing (referring to her sitting position), she replied ""what the F\*\*\* does it look like I'm doing?"". I muttered ""okay, damn"" as it felt quite aggressive, she rolled her eyes and said ""I could not have been more obviously joking, Jesus"".

3. We were over at our cousin's house. We had had coffee, Ella and I were sitting on the sofa, both finished. Ella was going up to put her cup away, she asked me if I wanted her to put mine away. I said no thanks (I don't know why, I was very tired and kind of hungover), she rolled her eyes and snatched it out of my hands. I know it sounds silly, but in the moment it felt very disrespectful and almost like she viewed me as a child. If she had simply said ""I'm going to put mine away anyway"" rather than snatching it, I think I would feel more okay with it. Snatching the cup just felt very rude.

4. This is minor as hell, but we were watching Harry Potter and Ella said ""it's kind of insane that JKR thought all this up"". I don't think too highly of Harry Potter or Rowling, so I said nothing until Ella made a fuss about how no-one reacted. I said ""I mean yeah, but it's not like she's the first author to do this"" and that better fantasy books exist. Ella responded quite sharply, ""sorry how many books have you written?"". Ella knows I go to a writing group and am trying to write a novel. I've also written a novel length fanfiction which I don't think she knows about, but she does know I write fanfiction as well. I didn't call her up on this, I do think it was accidental and meant as a joke, but it did rub me personally the wrong way. But I also know I shit on a book series she loves. 

There are other incidents as well, I think the thing I have heard most since I got home is ""will you just stop talking?"", mostly from Ella, followed by ""I did not listen to anything you just said"", but I'd be here all night trying to type them.

I would like to have a conversation with Ella about her behaviour, but I want to know if I am over-reacting before I do so. Hopefully it would be a mature conversation, with ""I feel disrespected when you do this, I would appreciate if you handled it differently in future, I want to tlak about this now because I love you and do not want to resent you in the future"".

We eventually get to the topic of work, he says that he's fortunate to have great mentors in life, who have become very wealthy and have been able to retire in their mid 30's and is inspired by them to be the best person financially he can be. Interested by his positivity and optimism, I ask if we can get together sometime for coffee and chat some more, he says yes.

The following week, we chat a bit more and at the end of it, he gives me some material to read through (Cashflow by Robert Kiyosak, the same author who wrote: Rich Dad, Poor Dad), and companies to look at, (Amway, Herbalife, etc) as examples and says we'll chat some more once I'm done looking it over.

Well, I just got done reading the material, and while the text is thought-provoking, the part that concerns me is the next ""step"" in the process. He suggests I focus my financial efforts on MLM's, same as him. He claims it offers the best financial opportunity for growth. When I asked him: ""Aren't those the same thing as pyramid schemes that take advantage of people?"" He told me that: ""No. They are not the same. They do have a pyramid-like structure, as do many legitimate businesses, but money is made by selling products or services."" He told me I could even go to the BBB & FTC websites to double check he wasn't lying. Many of these companies have good standing accreditation, but doing some of my own research, I've found numerous accounts, news articles and legal cases that would suggest the exact opposite. He told me to just use my eyes and see how much money these companies make and not to take the news articles and other instances I found researching outside of the BBB & FTC as truth.

I feel conflicted. It's not an area I have a lot of knowledge in, maybe he knows something I don't. Any advice?",0,1735254972.0,Advice,2,0.5,False

We met this summer (around the end of July) and I really, really like her. She lives on the opposite side of town, and we don't talk super often, only maybe once a month (if even that) but here's the thing. Today I was out in town with one of my friends and I suddenly saw her, talking to her brother. Now, keep in mind I haven't seen this girl irl for almost 5 months, so I was awestruck, kind of wide eyed and mouthed looking at her. And here's another thing- my appearance changed quite a lot during those 5 months. I wear my glasses regularly now, and at the time my hair was down and styled (I have curly hair, so it makes a big difference), where as before I had rarely ever worn my glasses and I always wore my hair up. She also looked a bit different, her hair grew out (she had very short hair before) and she was wearing eyeliner and mascara. But anyway, yeah. For the first few seconds, I was trying to figure out if it was really her, which in all honesty probably made me look hella weird, and when I figured out it was her, I was like 
""Hey, [insert her name], it's me, [insert my name]"" And the worst part is, she didn't recognize me until later, after my friend who I was with made me call her an explain (and possibly meet up) In the end, it was all sorted out and we laughed it off, but it makes me wonder if I should just shoot my shot and ask her on a date. For some information I forgot to add: she's a confirmed lesbian (I'm personally bi), and we have had a very flirty relationship, something like a situationship. But I'm scared that if I ask her out and we end up doing something and (possibly) getting together, it won't last since we don't love close to eachother. I've been debating with myself if I should just invite her to go iceskating or to get a coffee with me, or if she actually doesn't like me or has maybe lost interest in me. If you have any, I really need ideas what to do and where to go if you think I should as her out.

TBH, my friends suck at gifting. Hell, my mom sucks at gifting. Example: everyone found out that I have a small (used to be small, anyway) collection of coffee cups. That was 2 years ago. I had maybe 8 cups. Since they found this out, my collection is now at 30+. In 2 years! 22 cups in 2 years.

People ask what I want. I send pictures of the things I would like. Example: I sent pictures of a chin strap to help with my snoring. Nothing outrageous and nothing specific. It was an idea. No chin strap. But I did get 3 more coffee cups.

I just don't want to be bothered with anything gifting. Is that so wrong? Is it selfish of me? I know it's the thought.

Her parents got divorced 3 years ago. A few months after her dad started dating and has been with his current gf since then. I have heard the most horrible things said about this woman from her and her mother since then. (For some context, I have a step-mother and I love her as if she were my real mom.) why I'm confused about this is that I was with her when her parents were together and they were awful to each other. I even got to see her mom throw things at her dad with me in the living room. So, I've never understood why my gf hates her dad's new gf so much. She always tries to include my gf to outings and always buys her gifts. I usually just keep my mouth shut when both her and her mom talk about this lady. However yesterday morning I couldn't ignore how my gf was treating this lady. Christmas morning I was invited for brunch and the new gf made breakfast for everyone. When it was time to eat the lady asked my girlfriend if she wanted coffee or a hot chocolate, and my girlfriend completely ignored her (her dad was outside at the time) I was so embarrassed that I ended up answering for my gf and asked for two coffees.  Lets just say my gf was not happy with me. Our drive to my parents (dad and stepmom) house was a very quiet one until she asked why I had answered. Long story short I basically told her that she was being rude and to give this woman a chance. She asked me to take her to her house instead and we didn't spend the rest of Christmas Day together. We still have not spoken since then and now I'm wondering AITAh?

1hn0ol5,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1hn0ol5/anyone_else_have_to_go_through_a_christmas_with_a/,Anyone else have to go through a Christmas with a new baby in the family/a new pregnancy?,"I'm sure a lot of you will be able to relate to this story. I'm so upset and sad right now.

When I think back to most of the Christmases since I was a late teen (I'm in my mid 30s now), my sister (my best friend) and I would have the greatest time. Our family is pretty dysfunctional, but her and I would always make the best of the holidays. Christmas Eve we'd usually get drunk on spiked egg nog and wine, eat cookies, wrap presents together, and watch Christmas movies. Christmas Day we'd sleep in until 11, wake up, and start with Bailey's and coffee. We'd then spend the whole day helping mom cook and bake, getting wine drunk and enjoying Christmas beers and cocktails, listening to music, then always sit beside each other at the table and provide moral support to each other through the (usually hectic) dinners with the extended family. Always some drama at Christmas but her and I always had a blast and made the best of it (and made eyes at each other when someone said something ridiculous or political).

CUT TO THIS CHRISTMAS: My sister is currently 8 months pregnant. I knew Christmas would be different since she is now married and carrying a parasite (lol sigh). But I figured, minus the drinking, things would be mostly the same. Right? RIGHT? Fuck how wrong was I.

Dinner was to be at our mom's house. I headed to my sister's house mid-afternoon on Christmas Day. I was soooo excited. I travelled from my city so it took me an entire day, 2 plane rides, a ferry ride, an overly expensive uber, 4 buses, and 3 miles of walking to get to her house (plus cost me a ton of $$$). So, I was ecstatic to see her to say the least . She was exhausted and still sleeping when I got there... since (of course) her future child is sucking the life out of her. She eventually woke up and we caught up a bit (I have not seen her for a whole year at this point). She is still sleepy at this point but sits with me and tries to hold a conversation while we each sip water. I can already tell that this Christmas will be sooo different. Whatever, maybe when we get to my mom's house she will perk up! Plus, I already got a taste of losing her to her husband (she just seems less interested in me since she got married in general) but how different could this dinner really be? My god if I knew yesterday what I know now, I would have just stayed home.

So we drive over to the family house, and the usual light family drama is underway. I pour a glass of wine, and her a glass of sparkling juice. She can't engage much in conversation as she is still exhausted. So she sits in a chair and a few of us sit around and feed her snacks. All good. I'm trying to get hyped up at this point but when she is low energy I feel it too. Half of the company is awesome, the other half drives me nuts. I have nobody to lament to. My partner in crime/best friend (my sister) is still so out of it. She can barely keep her head up. This is the first Christmas in 16 years that her and I don't sit beside each other. Everyone is swooning over her belly, her pregnancy. She is hardly interested in any of the conversation. Dinner lasts all of 1 hour. I enjoy the conversation with the people beside me, but this is nothing like the Christmas I know. I want more than 1 glass of wine, but nobody else is drinking. The vibe is off. Everyone is worried about her. Sister gets SO tired that she has to go lie down on the bed. She then promptly leaves with her husband shortly after. No hugs, no goodbyes, no nothing. The party dies down shortly after, and the rest of the people go home. No board games, no present opening. She already enjoyed Christmas eve dinner and opening presents and watching movies with her husband/new unborn baby (before I showed up), so she already had her fun and I guess was too exhausted because of the baby and her new family life to enjoy Christmas with me. I love my sister dearly, I am happy for her, I hope this is what she wants in her life. I know she is doing her best. But I was soo disappointed. The night is over...I sit with my mom a bit longer then drive home and just go to sleep. 

I wake up today and am somewhat in high spirits as we agreed to have a sister's catch up day today (on boxing day).  Maybe today will make up for yesterday. Only her and I for a few hours with snacks and music and talking. She sends me a text as I am getting ready to leave asking when I am coming, then hints that she might have to cancel as she has to spend the day getting the baby's room organized. HELLLOOOO? I am in town once a year, for 1-2 days at a time. All I want is to sit and have a catch up. And you have to organize the unborn baby's room, TODAY, now?????? I am NOT putting my sister down, she is not a bad person or a bad sister. I think she is just SO blinded by her pregnancy and SO caught up in her new pregnant lifestyle that ANYTHING that is not related to her baby, her husband, or her new mom lifestyle isn't important enough. The sister I used to know would go out of her way to hang out with me. This person hardly can stay awake to talk to me, or bother to have me over at her house. It will be 1000x worse once the baby comes.

I am sitting here devastated by this new reality. I hate the new family dynamic. I understand people get married, have kids, and things change. But I didn't think it would be THIS BAD. This unborn baby essentially is already making holidays terrible (for me). This Christmas was hard enough. Next will be even worse as there will be a 10 month old stealing the show even more. My sister won't pay an ounce of attention to me, nor will the family. I know it will be all about the new baby as it is the first baby in our family. I sound like a selfish brat. But I just hate how things change when a baby (unborn or not) is involved. I think next Christmas I'll just come early to see my mom, then fuck off for the actual Christmas day and do a solo trip!! Cause fuck this!

Can anyone relate to this??? Any stories you guys can share that will help make me feel better? Anyone else have their holidays overshadowed by either a pregnant family member, or a new baby/kids in the family?",12,1735254468.0,childfree,9,0.88,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

Hydrogen peroxide. That fizzy, bubbling liquid often found in medicine cabinets. Most folks know it as a first-aid staple for cleaning scrapes and cuts. But did you know it‚Äôs also making a splash in the world of oral hygiene? Yes, we're talking about hydrogen peroxide mouthwash for bad breath. Now, swirling this stuff around your mouth might seem a bit‚Ä¶ intense. So, let‚Äôs dive deep into the bubbling world of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash and uncover the truth behind its breath-busting potential. Is it a miracle cure or a recipe for disaster? Let‚Äôs find out!

Hydrogen Peroxide Mouthwash Bad Breath: A Deep Dive
---------------------------------------------------

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let‚Äôs establish why this topic even matters. Bad breath, or halitosis as it‚Äôs known in the fancy dental world, can be a real confidence killer. It can affect your social life, your professional life, heck, even your dating life! So, finding a solution is a big deal for many people. Hydrogen peroxide mouthwash often pops up as a potential remedy, promising to obliterate bad breath at its source. But does it really measure up?

### What Causes Bad Breath Anyway?

Think of your mouth as a bustling metropolis. Millions of bacteria are constantly at work, breaking down food particles and, unfortunately, releasing some pretty stinky byproducts. These volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) are the main culprits behind that dreaded dragon breath. Other factors can contribute too, like dry mouth, certain medical conditions, and, of course, the usual suspects like garlic and onions.

### How Does Hydrogen Peroxide Work Its Magic?

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a powerful oxidizing agent. In simple terms, it breaks down into water and oxygen. This release of oxygen creates that characteristic fizz you see when you apply it to a wound. That same fizzing action is what supposedly helps combat bad breath. The oxygen is thought to neutralize those nasty VSCs, leaving your breath smelling fresher than a daisy.

### Hydrogen Peroxide Mouthwash Bad Breath: The Pros and Cons

So, is hydrogen peroxide mouthwash the holy grail of fresh breath? Well, like most things in life, it‚Äôs not quite that simple. Let‚Äôs weigh the pros and cons:

**Pros:**

- **Kills bacteria:** The oxidizing power of hydrogen peroxide can effectively kill bacteria, including those responsible for bad breath.
- **Whitening effect:** A bonus perk! Hydrogen peroxide can help whiten your teeth, giving you a sparkling smile to go with that fresh breath.
- **Readily available and inexpensive:** You can usually find hydrogen peroxide at your local drugstore without breaking the bank.

**Cons:**

- **Can irritate gums:** Using hydrogen peroxide too often or at too high a concentration can irritate your delicate gum tissue. Ouch!
- **Tooth sensitivity:** Some folks experience increased tooth sensitivity after using hydrogen peroxide.
- **Disrupts oral microbiome:** While killing bad bacteria is good, wiping out *all* bacteria can disrupt the balance of your oral microbiome, potentially leading to other issues down the line.

Hydrogen Peroxide Mouthwash Bad Breath: DIY vs. Store-Bought
------------------------------------------------------------

Thinking of giving hydrogen peroxide mouthwash a whirl? You have two main options: DIY or store-bought.

### DIY Hydrogen Peroxide Mouthwash: Proceed with Caution!

You can make your own hydrogen peroxide mouthwash by diluting 3% hydrogen peroxide with water. The typical recommendation is to mix equal parts hydrogen peroxide and water. However, it's crucial to get the concentration right. Using a higher concentration can seriously damage your mouth. Seriously! So, if you‚Äôre not sure, it‚Äôs always best to err on the side of caution and chat with your dentist first.

### Store-Bought Hydrogen Peroxide Mouthwash: A Safer Bet?

Store-bought mouthwashes containing hydrogen peroxide are generally formulated with a lower concentration and often include other ingredients to enhance flavor and minimize potential side effects. They‚Äôre generally a safer option than the DIY route, but still, it's a good idea to check with your dentist before incorporating them into your routine.

Hydrogen Peroxide Mouthwash Bad Breath: Effective or Just Hype?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Now, for the million-dollar question: Does hydrogen peroxide mouthwash *actually* work for bad breath? The short answer is: it can, but it's not a long-term solution. Think of it as a temporary fix, like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound. It might mask the smell for a bit, but it won't address the underlying cause.

### Long-Term Solutions for Fresh Breath

For lasting fresh breath, you need to tackle the root of the problem. Here are some tried and true strategies:

1. **Brush and floss like a boss:** This one‚Äôs a no-brainer. Regular brushing and flossing remove food particles and plaque, depriving those stinky bacteria of their feast.
2. **Stay hydrated:** Dry mouth is a breeding ground for bacteria. Drinking plenty of water keeps your mouth moist and helps wash away debris.
3. **See your dentist regularly:** Your dentist can identify and treat any underlying dental issues that might be contributing to your bad breath.
4. **Tongue scraping:** Your tongue can harbor a surprising amount of bacteria. A tongue scraper can help remove those unwanted guests.
5. **Watch your diet:** Limit your intake of odor-causing foods like garlic, onions, and coffee.

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Hydrogen Peroxide Mouthwash Bad Breath: When to See a Doctor
------------------------------------------------------------

While occasional bad breath is usually nothing to worry about, persistent halitosis could be a sign of something more serious. If your bad breath persists despite good oral hygiene, it‚Äôs important to see your doctor or dentist. They can help determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment.

### Beyond Bad Breath: Other Uses of Hydrogen Peroxide in Oral Hygiene

Interestingly, hydrogen peroxide finds applications beyond just battling bad breath. It's sometimes used for:

- **Canker sore relief:** Diluted hydrogen peroxide can help soothe canker sores and promote healing.
- **Gum infection treatment:** Your dentist may use hydrogen peroxide as part of a treatment plan for gum infections.

Hydrogen Peroxide Mouthwash Bad Breath: The Bottom Line
-------------------------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs wrap things up. Hydrogen peroxide mouthwash can offer a temporary reprieve from bad breath, but it‚Äôs not a magic bullet. While its oxidizing properties can neutralize odor-causing bacteria, it's essential to use it cautiously and at the right concentration. For long-lasting fresh breath, focus on good oral hygiene, a healthy diet, and regular visits to your dentist. Don‚Äôt rely solely on quick fixes. Think of it this way: you wouldn't just spray air freshener in a dirty room and expect it to stay clean, would you? The same logic applies to your mouth!

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

**Conclusion:**

So there you have it, folks! The lowdown on hydrogen peroxide mouthwash and its role in combating bad breath. Remember, it‚Äôs a tool, not a cure-all. Used wisely, it can be a helpful addition to your oral hygiene routine, but it‚Äôs not a substitute for the basics. And if you‚Äôre ever concerned about persistent bad breath, don't hesitate to seek professional advice. Your dentist is your best ally in the fight for a healthier, fresher-smelling mouth.",1,1735254060.0,FreshBreathChampion,0,1.0,False

Haven't had a chance to start reading, but did some flip throughs and wanted to share some initial thoughts on the book in case anyone was curious about getting it.

The book itself is beautiful and makes for a great coffee table book. It's probably 65%/35% pictures vs. words. There are sections to the book with different subjects I.e. ""Identity"", ""Dedication"", ""Passion"". James Horncastle did a lot of the writing, so I'm sure it's good and can update when I have a chance to read it. 

There are some great classic pictures and a lot of them, but A LOT of the modern pictures (which I would say are about half of total pictures) are from last season. They include quotes throughout the book as well. Some given for the book and some taken from past interviews.

While I can't give a full review, wanted to point out some annoyances/decisions that seemed intentional.

* The foreword of the book is written by Gerry along with a picture of him. It's nothing bad, just his usual generic platitudes
* There are about 3 more pictures of Gerry in the book as if he is an important figure in the Milan history, including a full 2 page spread of individual photos of famous managers/Silvio, but then it also includes pics of Gerry, Furlani, and Fonseca lol. There is a pic of Padre Pioli in the book
* The quotes throughout the book are from famous managers, players, etc. as well as some famous fans like Kobe Bryant and Jannik Sinner. But then there is also the world's most generic quote from LeBron James about Milan. Also there's a Scaroni quote lol
* My biggest gripe is the lack of recognition for the Maldini name. While not shocking, there is only a singular quote from Cesare, not Paolo. There are pics of Paolo, but there is nothing written about the family ties to the club, outside from one picture caption. It's shameful. I have a Milan These Football Times zine that has a substantial section on Maldini legacy intertwined with Milan.


Overall, while I am thankful to have received the book, as it makes a great gift. I am not sure if the book is worth the $155 if you were to buy on you own. Happy to answer questions anyone has on it.",14,1735253812.0,ACMilan,2,0.95,False

There are some distinct differences, though, such as Vandermeer's employment and demeanor. ""A damn fine cup of coffee!"" was referenced in Case 23.

Laura Palmer = Laura Vanderboom. Both struggled with mental health issues and both died (though Palmer was murdered and Vanderboom committed suicide). Also, both of them took drugs, though Laura Palmer was a recreational user while Laura Vanderboom's medication was a prescription (I suspect it was prescribed by Mr. Owl). However, Laura Palmer was a popular party girl and a high school student, while Laura Vanderboom was significantly older and had a very different personality.

Twin Peaks = the area surrounding Rusty Lake.

The Great Northern = Rusty Lake Hotel. This would make Mr. Owl a parallel to Benjamin Horne. I can sort of see a few similarities, the main one being how both of them are the secret rulers of the town. However, Ben Horne had no idea that anything supernatural was going on in Twin Peaks, while Mr. Owl knows *everything.*

The Black Lodge = the Forest beneath Rusty Lake. It's the home of the dark spirits and the source of all supernatural events occurring in all of the RL games.

The dark spirits in the Lodge = the Corrupted Souls. They even have similar VOICES!

BOB = William Vanderboom, a dark spirit possessing one of the characters and causing Laura's death. However, BOB possessed Laura Palmer's father, Leland, while William possessed Laura Vanderboom herself. NOTE: both Lauras died by the hand of their ancestor.

Bobby Briggs = Robert Hill. Both are named ""Bob"", both dated their Laura, and both were suspected for Laura's death. However, there are major differences in their personalities.

Curtain room = Paradox Room. Both Dales were trapped in these rooms and encountered strange figures.

THE OWLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM = Mr. Owl, the all-seeing Ruler of the Lake.

One-Eyed Jack's = The White Door. Establishments both with illegitimate purposes, and both are run by the secret ruler of the town. However, the White Door is a mental health facility while One-Eyed Jack's is a brothel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Living in a tiny home can be a rewarding experience, especially when it comes to saving money and reducing your environmental impact. However, making the most of such a limited space requires clever planning and innovative strategies. Here are some effective space-saving solutions that can help you live comfortably in your tiny home.

### Maximize Vertical Space

When dealing with tiny living, don‚Äôt forget to look up! Utilizing vertical space can be a game changer. Here are some options:

- **Wall-Mounted Shelves:** Install shelves high on the walls to store books, plants, or decorative items. This keeps your floor space free.
- **Over-the-Door Organizers:** Use the back of doors for additional storage. Hang organizers for shoes, cleaning supplies, or pantry items.
- **Tall Furniture:** Choose tall, narrow bookshelves or towers that draw the eyes upward, rather than wide furniture that takes up a lot of ground space.

### Choose Multi-Functional Furniture

Investing in furniture that serves more than one purpose is key to living comfortably in a tiny home. Here are some ideas:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/how-can-you-make-the-most-of-a-tiny-home?  
  
- **Sofa Beds:** A sofa bed allows you to have a comfortable place to sit during the day and transforms into a bed for guests at night.
- **Storage Ottomans:** These can act as seating, footrests, or coffee tables while providing hidden storage inside.
- **Folding Tables:** A folding dining table can be stowed away when not in use, liberating floor space.

### Organize with Smart Storage Solutions

An organized space feels larger and more inviting. Here are some strategies to keep your tiny home tidied up:

- **Under-Bed Storage:** Use bins or drawers under your bed to store seasonal clothing or extra bedding.
- **Stackable Containers:** Invest in stackable bins for your pantry or bathroom to maximize vertical space while keeping items accessible.
- **Room Dividers with Storage:** If you need to separate areas, consider open shelving dividers that can also hold books or decorative items.

### Prioritize Decluttering

Living in a tiny home means you need to minimize the clutter. Here are ways you can do that:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/how-can-you-make-the-most-of-a-tiny-home?  
  
- **Regular Purging:** Go through your belongings regularly and donate or discard items you no longer use.
- **One In, One Out Rule:** Whenever you acquire a new item, make it a habit to let go of something you already have.
- **Sentimental Items:** Limit the number of sentimental items you keep. Choose a few that truly mean something to you.

### Use Mirrors to Create Illusions

Mirrors can work wonders in a tiny space. Here‚Äôs how:

- **Reflective Surfaces:** Place mirrors strategically to reflect light and create an illusion of depth, making your space feel larger.
- **Mirrored Furniture:** Consider items like coffee tables or cabinets with mirrored surfaces for added brightness and openness.

### Design with Open Concepts

Whenever possible, aim for an open concept design that merges living, dining, and kitchen areas. This creates a continuous flow, minimizing the boxed-in feel common with small spaces. Here are some tips:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/how-can-you-make-the-most-of-a-tiny-home?  
  
- **Glass Partition:** Instead of solid walls, consider glass partitions that maintain visual openness while separating areas.
- **Unified Color Palette:** Use a consistent color scheme throughout the space to unify the environment, making it feel more spacious.

Making the most of a tiny home requires creativity and planning, but with these space-saving solutions, you can enjoy a stylish, functional, and comfortable living space. By embracing multi-functional furniture, organizing smartly, and keeping your space decluttered, you‚Äôll create an environment that feels much larger than it is while still reflecting your personal style.

Finding ways to effectively use your living space will not only enhance your quality of life but will also prepare you to fully embrace the joys of tiny living.

The Benefits of Minimalism in Small Living Spaces
-------------------------------------------------

Living in a small space can seem challenging, but adopting minimalism can turn it into a haven of tranquility and functionality. If you‚Äôre wondering how to make the most of your tiny home, minimalism is the key. It encourages you to simplify, declutter, and focus on what truly matters in your living environment. By doing so, you not only enhance your physical space but also your mental clarity.

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/how-can-you-make-the-most-of-a-tiny-home?  
  
### Embracing Simplicity

When you embrace minimalism, you start to prioritize necessary items over unnecessary clutter. This shift in mindset can lead to a more peaceful living space. To get started, consider these steps:

- **Declutter Regularly:** Make it a habit to go through your belongings periodically. Let go of items that no longer serve you or fit your lifestyle.
- **Invest in Quality over Quantity:** Choose fewer, high-quality items that will last longer. This not only saves you money in the long run but also keeps your space tidy.
- **Streamline Your Furniture:** Opt for multi-purpose furniture. For example, a sofa bed can serve as both seating and sleeping space, maximizing utility.

### Enhancing Functionality

Minimalism encourages you to rethink how your space is used. Here are some effective ways to enhance functionality through minimalistic choices:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/how-can-you-make-the-most-of-a-tiny-home?  
  
- **Open Floor Plan:** Keep your living area open and airy. An open floor design can create a sense of spaciousness even in small homes.
- **Use Vertical Space:** Install shelves and cabinets that draw the eye upwards. Utilizing vertical space can help organize items and keep your floors clear.
- **Designate Zones:** Clearly define areas for specific activities, such as a reading nook or a workspace. This can prevent overlap and make your tiny home feel larger.

### Creating Visual Calm

The colors and designs you choose can significantly affect how spacious your home feels. Here‚Äôs how to create a visually calming environment:

- **Neutral Color Palette:** Stick to light and neutral colors for the walls and larger pieces of furniture. This can help create an illusion of more space.
- **Limit Patterns:** While some accents can add character, too many patterns can overwhelm a small space. Choose one or two accent pieces with bold patterns.
- **Use Mirrors Wisely:** Mirrors can make a space feel larger and brighter. Consider placing a mirror across from a window to maximize natural light.

### Fostering a Meaningful Lifestyle

Choosing minimalism in a small living space helps you focus on what truly matters in life. Here‚Äôs how it encourages a more meaningful lifestyle:

- **Value Experiences Over Possessions:** With less emphasis on material things, you can invest your time in meaningful experiences‚Äîlike traveling or spending time with loved ones.

- **Promote Personal Growth:** Living minimally pushes you to evaluate and prioritize what's essential. This self-reflection can lead to personal development and growth.

Incorporating minimalism into your small living space can transform it into an organized, functional, and peaceful retreat. By simplifying your surroundings, you not only enhance your home but also your quality of life. If you‚Äôre looking to create an inviting atmosphere in your tiny home, embracing a minimalist approach is undoubtedly the best way forward.

1hn0c66,https://www.reddit.com/r/sheajournalsagain/comments/1hn0c66/mirror_man/,Mirror Man,"Dear Diary,
I'm in love with him. I think about him all the time, I keep him in mind, I want to kiss him, I want him around me.

Today, I went over to his house to do a little bit of coworking. He made me coffee and we both worked separately. He was at his table and I was on his bed.

We bantered back and forth and ended up spending too much time laughing with each other. He kept coming over to kiss me. He wasn't very particular about work, but I got some done.

He had some music on and eventually around 5:30 when he popped over for a kiss, I accidentally got horny. He had his tongue in my mouth and my top was low cut and he kept kissing my cleavage and I just wanted him so much.

Eventually I let him come over onto me and gave him my first ever blowjob (to him)!!!

He said I was really good but he didn't let me go for too long. He eventually just wanted to enter me.

He loves missionary, he said it's because he gets to see my face.

While pounding away, he said he wants to ask me to be his girlfriend eventually and I thought it was so funny because he was balls deep in me while saying this. ""Eventually"". I started giggling, mid fuck.

He must've felt shy because he kept pressing me to get an answer and I kept saying ""I don't know"". All this was happening while I was getting fucked with his gorgeous delicious cock and ofc I didn't have an answer, I was cock drunk.

He said things like, ""Your pussy is intoxicating."" And that he wanted me to stay the night, and I was giggling again.

I feel so sweet and cute with him.

Mr. Man came in me today, because I asked him to.

I'm not sure why I asked him to, but it was exciting and it felt intoxicating to have him cum in me. Remind me to take the morning after pill, Diary, I'm not ready to be a mom yet.

I want to be his girlfriend.

1hn0byg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hn0byg,Back from the dead,"Saved this 2017 Classic from the transfer station on Tuesday. The pump and boiler worked but no flow through group head. Tore it down, there was a ridiculous amount of scale in the boiler, cleaned the 3 way twice before it finally flowed. I had a VST screen and basket and a Silvia wand on a 1990s ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äù model so those moved over. The steam valve is leaky so I‚Äôll replace that and change the OPV pressure down. Maybe I‚Äôll get a set of gaskets too. My second shot was 18.5 g in, 40 ml yield in 35 seconds, tasted good. Nice to have dry pucks too, really tickled by this!
