Typically, one cup of coffee needs one to two tablespoons of coffee grounds.**

Brewing coffee can feel like an art. The right coffee-to-water ratio is crucial for flavor. Too much coffee, and it‚Äôs too strong; too little, and it‚Äôs weak. Finding the perfect balance can be tricky. This guide will help you understand how many tablespoons of coffee per cup you need.

Whether you like it bold or mild, the right measurement makes all the difference. Let‚Äôs dive into the details and make every cup just right.

# Coffee Basics

Finding the perfect cup of coffee often starts with a simple question: How many tablespoons of coffee per cup? This basic step sets the foundation for a great brew. Understanding the coffee basics can help you get the right balance of flavor and strength in every cup.

# Types Of Coffee Beans

Knowing the types of coffee beans is crucial. Each type has a unique flavor and strength. The most popular beans are Arabica and Robusta.

* **Arabica:**¬†These beans are popular for their smooth, complex flavor. They make up about 60% of the world‚Äôs coffee. Arabica beans have less caffeine than Robusta.
* **Robusta:**¬†Known for their strong, bitter taste. These beans have a higher caffeine content. They are often used in espresso blends.
* **Liberica:**¬†Less common, but with a unique, fruity flavor. These beans are grown in specific regions and can be harder to find.
* **Excelsa:**¬†A variety of Liberica, these beans have a tart, fruity flavor. They add complexity to coffee blends.

Choosing the right bean depends on your taste. If you like a smooth, mild coffee, go for Arabica. For a strong, bold cup, choose Robusta. Experimenting with different beans can help you find your perfect brew.

# Brewing Methods

The brewing method also affects how many tablespoons of coffee you need per cup. Different methods require different amounts and grind sizes.

|Brewing Method|Grind Size|Coffee to Water Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee|Medium|1:15|
|French Press|Coarse|1:12|
|Espresso|Fine|1:2|
|Aeropress|Medium-Fine|1:16|
|Pour Over|Medium|1:17|

For drip coffee, use a medium grind and a ratio of 1 tablespoon per 15 grams of water. French Press requires a coarse grind and a ratio of 1 tablespoon per 12 grams of water. Espresso needs a fine grind and a ratio of 1 tablespoon per 2 grams of water.

Each method has its own charm. Drip coffee is convenient for everyday use. French Press gives a richer, full-bodied flavor. Espresso is strong and concentrated. Aeropress is versatile and easy to clean. Pour over offers control and precision.

Finding your favorite brewing method can take time. Try different methods and see which one suits your taste. This can help you enjoy the perfect cup of coffee every time.

1i6ox9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand_travel/comments/1i6ox9w/2_week_solo_road_trip_of_the_south_island_review/,2 week solo road trip of the South Island review (very long),"I just completed my whirlwind two week roadtrip through the South Island and wanted to get my thoughts down while they are still fresh. I received a lot of good advice in these forums (particularly from a user named coalclifff) and want to repay the favour in kind and hopefully help someone in their planning. I apologize in advance as this is a very long post involving some personal anecdotes so I don‚Äôt blame anyone not wanting to read it all!

Tldr:  if you want to cut down on driving skip the west coast.  Of course it‚Äôs beautiful but there is so much to do and see in such a short time I don‚Äôt feel it justifies the driving times. With that said, if you think this will be your only visit then you might want to squeeze it all in but be advised it involves hours and hours of driving.

Background: I am a male in my mid 40s who was traveling on my own. My main interests in traveling the South Island were seeing the spectacular scenery, hiking (day hikes), interesting animal encounters and food.  I will say that I had started off in hostels (mainly private rooms) but quickly changed to other accommodations as I did not like the hostel ‚Äúscene‚Äù.  I would say shared airbnbs are the best option for a mature solo traveler as they are still reasonably priced, there are opportunities to meet the other guests (which I did) but you still have the privacy and comfort of your own space.

Ok here is the itinerary and highlights (and some lowlights!):

Jan 8 flew into Christchurch late afternoon.  I just walked around the downtown area, saw the church being rebuilt and had dinner and a beer on New Regent Street. I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with Christchurch but it was grey and I was there only a few hours. If I ever came back I would try to hike Godley Head which I heard is great!

Jan 9 - drove to Kaikoura (about 2-3 hours).  I was told beforehand in this forum that Kaikoura is not to be missed and I wholly agree.  I arrived for lunch and had crayfish from the food truck that is very popular.  Then I did the entire peninsula walk which takes 3-4 hours and is absolutely spectacular. Once you get off the main road you will see many many seals and birds and very interesting scenery with different colours, smells (of the sea) and rocks.  Totally loved it.  For dinner I had paua which is abalone or sea snail also known as the mushroom of the sea! It was delicious and I highly recommend trying it if you‚Äôre a seafood lover.  The next morning at 530 am I went swimming with dolphins through Encounter Kaikoura and it is definitely one of the highlights of the entire two weeks. I have written about it elsewhere on this forum but if you have any question feel free to message me.

Jan 10 - after the dolphin swim I began the looong drive to Abel Tasman (4 hours).  This is where if I had to do it over again I would not have made this choice as it involved too much driving. With that said I still had fun barring a few things. On the way to Abel Tasman I stopped in Havelock for mussels for lunch and they were delicious! Highly recommend.

Jan 11 - after a very uncomfortable sleep in a hostel in Marahau I woke up to rain.  It did not help! I was not excited to go hiking in the rain but magically 10 minutes before my water taxi was to depart it stopped raining and I made my way to Barks Bay. Intially I had planned to hike all the way back to Marahau (17km) but with the weather and bad nights sleep I only hiked to Anchorage (still a good 3-4 hour hike) and took the water taxi back.  It was beautiful of course but if I had to do it over again I would recommend staying in Motueka which is only a 15 minute drive to Marahau where you pick up the water taxi (can also get a water taxi in Kaiteriteri).  Also, I think it would be cool to spend two days in Abel Tasman NP and actually sleep in one of the cabins in the park over night. Alternatively there is an option to do a kayak and a hike (it‚Äôs called the best of both worlds) and I think that would actually have been a great choice especially if the weather was better. Anyway, the drive from Kaikoura to Abel Tasman was very long and then leaving Abel Tasman to Punakaiki was also long so I don‚Äôt think it was all that worth it for one 4 hour hike but the scenery itself (especially the drive into Punakaiki) is beautiful so it may not matter.  

Jan 12 - I had booked a motel in Nelson since I couldn‚Äôt bear to spend another night in Marahau and boy was that the right decision. My own space and bathroom was great to recover and Nelson itself is super cute!  In the morning the sun was out (finally!) and I picked up an amazing raspberry, passion fruit and almond muffin from Bobby Franks Cafe and enjoyed it with a flat white before driving to Punakaiki. As mentioned the drive into (and out of) Punakaiki is gorgeous. The entire Buller Gorge is spectacular (I did not do any activities at the bridge).  As you approach the sea the colours of the ocean blending into the sky are magical.  I did the 1.5 hour river walk and it was a perfect palette cleanser.  The sunset from Truman Beach was beautiful as well.  Despite a nice day,  my accommodations again in Punakaiki were not up to snuff and I woke up rather depressed and a bit lonely (which is very unlike me).

Jan 13 - the drive to Franz Josef was again long contributing to why I think skipping the west coast is the better option given the limited time.  Once you start driving inland from the coast the towns are a bit depressing. Greymouth in particular seems rather sad (sorry to any Greymouth fans).  I rolled into FJ in the early afternoon and did a few of the shorter hikes from the parking lot at the end of the Glacier Road.  These were fun but as mentioned all over this forum the glacier itself has all but disappeared. You can really only see a bit at the top of the mountain and this is yet another reason to skip the west coast. With that said, the scenery is still stunning and I did a fabulous hike the next day.

Jan 14 - having somehow booked an entire dorm room with ensuite bathroom to myself I woke up refreshed and ready for the day. I needed my energy as I was hiking ‚ÄúRoberts Point‚Äù. This is an awesome challenging hike (4-5 hours) involving very high up swing bridges,  rock scrambling and some slippery parts (especially on the way down). If you‚Äôre into challenging yet completely doable hikes you must do this. Definitely in my top 3 hikes I did on the South Island.  You‚Äôll notice I haven‚Äôt mentioned any food in the last few days and that‚Äôs because there wasn‚Äôt really anything good!  However, I did have the ‚Äúbeef rendang‚Äù at Snakebite Brewery in FJ and it was quite good (get Thai spicy :).  

Jan 15 - waking up to yet another grey morning did not do any wonders for my mood. Especially because I had booked a helicopter tour to land on the glacier and it was cancelled two days in a row due to the low hanging cloud.  So after that was confirmed, I packed up my car and headed out of dodge :) I made a pit stop outside of the Fox glacier village to do the very easy walk around Lake Matheson. I was told that this is spectacular at sunrise‚Ä¶.. when there is a clear day. Well on a cloudy day this is really nothing special at all. It‚Äôs just a nice
Lake with a simple loop walk.  I always like to walk so I was still happy to do this but definitely not the top of my list :) ok‚Ä¶. This was the turning point in my trip as I made my way to Queenstown.  In my mind, Queenstown and the rest of the trip was going to be amazing and i was absolutely right. The drive to Queenstown (also long!!!) was gorgeous once you get into the ‚ÄúHaast Pass‚Äù and then the very windy descent into Queenstown itself is amazing. The colour of the lakes! The mountains! And then finally after being in dinky villages for the last few days a real city with real restaurants, a waterfront where people are gathered and enjoying, beautiful homes and awesome viewpoints.  I stayed in an Airbnb just out of the main centre of town where I met some lovely people and had my first really fun evening (involving a bit of wine and other substances).  The view over the lake and the sunset from the Airbnb was so great.  I was really happy.

Jan 16 - woke up raring to go with gorgeous blue skies and ready to tackle Ben Lomond! This was my favourite hike of the whole trip. It was challenging (4-5 hours uphill climb in the sun) and the views were unparalleled the whole way up and especially from the top! I highly recommend taking the gondola and skipping the first 2k which apparently is only through forest.  This is what I did by jumping on the first gondola at 9 am. I saw many people who had started the hike in the middle of the night but i was very happy with my choice and there were not too many people on the hike so I had my space.  It was really amazing. When I got back down I was quite exhausted and chilled out for awhile before making my way into town as I really wanted a dip in the pristine lake (amazing) and to try the ‚Äúmade famous by TikTok‚Äù Fergburger! Since I had nothing better to do then stand in line for an hour for a burger I arrived at 430 and was eating by 5 pm. Not bad but really I‚Äôve had better burgers!! Still was yummy enough and happy I was able to try it. There are many nice restaurants in Queenstown but being on my own I didn‚Äôt want to do any fine dining. I made my way back to the Airbnb full and satisfied with the day.

Jan 17 - on the road again this time to Te Anau which was about two hours away.  I had enough time to sneak in a hike just outside Te anau which was the ‚ÄúShallow Bay Hut‚Äù walk (2-3 hours) which is part of the larger ‚ÄúKepler Track‚Äù.  After being in full sun on the Ben Lomond hike I was happy for a fully shaded walk through a beautiful mossy forest. It was a great walk that ended up at a beach with nice views.  I made my way back and checked into my not so great accommodation in a room in a holiday park. Oh well, I didn‚Äôt let it get me down as this was really just a stop over to get to the pinnacle of the trip ‚ÄúMilford Sound‚Äù.  I had dinner at Red Cliff in Te Anau and I highly recommend it.

an 18 - following some advice in this forum I booked the first boat cruise in Milford Sound for 830 am. This was absolutely the right decision as there were only 10 people on the whole boat. The next boat after mine must have had 100 people so having the more private experience was definitely better (for me!).  With that said I had to leave Te Anau at the crack of dawn (literally) as it is about a two hour drive to Milford Sound. The boat cruise is totally worth it and a ‚Äúmust do‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think it really matters what company you choose they all seem to do the same thing.  I‚Äôll just say that Milford Sound is magical and I‚Äôll leave it at that.  It was a sunny day when I went which was great for seeing the mountains but apparently it is a completely different and cool experience when it rains as well as it creates many waterfalls.  Will have to come back on a rainy day :). Since I took the early boat cruise I was able to fit in another hike which was the absolutely spectacular Lake Marian hike. Wow!!! 2-3 hours round trip but the prize at the top: the Lake Marian glacial lake is amazing to behold. After sweating on the way up taking a dip in the glacial water is a must do. It‚Äôs a little cold but I am from Canada so I am used to cold lakes lol. If you can‚Äôt tell I loved it and I have the pictures to prove it.  Go!  After returning to my car I made the looooong journey to Wanaka where I showed up close to 8 pm.  I would say it probably makes more sense to do Wanaka -> Te Anau -> Queenstown as it would save an hour on the way back from Milford Sound but you do you.

Jan 19 - another day another hike!  After several successive sunny and warm days I woke up to cloud!  And this was the day I was to hike the ‚Äúinstagram famous‚Äù ‚ÄúRoy‚Äôs peak‚Äù.  Honestly, at this point I had seen so many beautiful vistas and mountains I was actually totally okay just doing the hike without the reward of the view. That and I only had one day in Wanaka so it was then or never! Personally, I loved the hike. I had read that the sun beats down on you the whole time so it is best to start before sunrise.  Given I didn‚Äôt have a headlamp and it was cloudy I started at 8 am and without the sun it made the challenging (very) steep uphill climb more bearable.  Another benefit of the cloud was that there weren‚Äôt that many people.  It was still busy but I definitely had times where I couldn‚Äôt see people ahead or behind me. I hiked to the peak and felt proud of the accomplishment.  Also, I had seen so many people do ‚Äútrail running‚Äù that I decided to jog down the mountain! This was much easier to do than other hikes because it is basically a dirt path without too many rocks the whole way.  I made it down in less than half the time it took to go up (1 hour 15 minutes to go down as opposed to 2.5 hours to go up). I was tired but had a great time.  I rested for a bit (and showered!) and then went to check out Wanaka which is a very cute and hip town! Lots of good food, coffee and drinks to be had. I had a couple of slices of pizza and booked an amazing experience at the ‚ÄúSecret Sauna‚Äù.  I had been wanting to do some sort of hot baths experience to rest my weary bones and this was the perfect thing. For $30 I booked a shared sauna/cold plunge experience where the cold plunge was right in the lake! Totally worth it as I chatted with a bunch of interesting people in the sauna itself.  Highly recommend this experience.  After this I went back to my Airbnb and did a take away of ribs and Mac and cheese from ‚Ä¶. Delicious!

Jan 20 - as I was now coming towards the end of my two week trip I was ready to start winding down. But not before another long driving day, more hiking and finally getting to do the helicopter experience.  All of this at Mt Cook National park. Wow, more stunning views and the first snow capped mountain range with perfect blue skies in the background. After a quick walk to see the Tasman Glacier (again heavily receded) I boarded the helicopter for an amazing tour up into the mountains and landing in a patch of snow. Wow very cool (and very expensive for a 25 minute flight) but I am happy I did it.  After this I did the famous ‚ÄúHooker Valley‚Äù hike. This was a very very busy hike. I cannot say I enjoyed that aspect of it as you were literally walking in a line of people. It does eventually thin out a bit but at this point it was very hot and I was very tired and I just wanted the hike to end lol.  The views are spectacular the entire length of the walk so don‚Äôt let me deter you. After this I made my way back to Twizel (1 hour) where I stayed in a lovely motel with a very modern and comfortable room for the night. I also had an awesome meal at the High Country Salmon farm just up the road from Twizel.  

Jan 21 - this was the end of my South Island circuit as I had to return the rental car in Christchurch by 2 pm for a 430 flight to Auckland and then back to Canada the next day. But I had time to squeeze in one more hike! I was tired but it was still completely worthwhile to do the ‚ÄúMount John Walkway‚Äù (2.5 hours) at Lake Tekapo. After the busyness of Hooker Valley this was a nice respite from the crowds as I saw a total of maybe 10 people the whole hike.  After this I drove to Christchurch and returned the car which had taken me through countless hours and kilometres around the South Island!!

What a great trip! Sorry for the super long post with lots of personal anecdotes but if you‚Äôve made it through the whole thing congrats and I hope it helps with any trip planning. Feel free to reach out with any questions and also there is a person with the handle ‚Äúcoalcliff‚Äù on this forum that has the best advice and should be listened to!

Starbucks has long been a go-to spot for people seeking a cozy place to work, meet friends, or simply soak in the buzz of a communal space. But starting January 27, 2025, things will change. The coffee giant is implementing a new policy that limits its cafes and bathrooms to paying customers. This marks a significant shift from the open-door policy Starbucks adopted in 2018, and it‚Äôs sparking conversations about the role of public spaces in our increasingly isolated world.

**Why This Change?**

Starbucks says the decision comes in response to feedback from employees. According to North America President Sara Trilling, there‚Äôs a growing need to ‚Äúreset expectations for how our spaces should be used, and who uses them.‚Äù The policy is part of a broader ‚ÄúBack to Starbucks‚Äù strategy led by new CEO Brian Niccol, aiming to prioritize customer experience and, ultimately, profitability.

**Beyond Coffee: The Role of Cafes as Community Hubs**

Starbucks‚Äô policy for community spaces for many, are more than just places to grab a latte. They‚Äôre modern-day community centers. Think about it: after school, where do you go to casually meet people, work on personal projects, or just be around others without the pressure of socializing? For many adults, especially after leaving the structured social environment of school, these spaces fill an important void.

Humans are naturally social creatures. Even the simple act of sitting in a cafe surrounded by others can create a sense of belonging. It‚Äôs not just about coffee; it‚Äôs about connection. By limiting access, Starbucks might inadvertently reduce opportunities for people to build these subtle but meaningful social connections.

**The Bigger Picture: Fewer Neutral Social Spaces**

This shift raises questions about where we can go to simply exist and engage with others in a neutral, non-commercial environment. Public parks and libraries serve this purpose, but they‚Äôre not always as accessible or welcoming as a cozy cafe. Beyond bars and restaurants, there‚Äôs a gap in spaces where people can connect without needing to spend money or commit to an activity.

**What‚Äôs Next? Starbucks‚Äô Policy for Community Spaces**

The new policy may have implications for how we view and value public spaces. Will it encourage other businesses to adopt similar policies, further limiting access to community hubs? Or will it inspire a push for more inclusive spaces?

Starbucks‚Äô decision reflects a broader cultural conversation about balancing business needs with community well-being. It‚Äôs a reminder of how essential these spaces are for fostering connection in a world that often feels increasingly disconnected.

You Just Need To Be You.

I‚Äôm reaching out because I need your help identifying someone in a photo. A few days ago, I was at a local coffee shop and saw a person who looked *very* familiar. I couldn‚Äôt place where I knew them from, but something about their face stuck with me. I‚Äôve been thinking about it ever since, but I don‚Äôt know how to go about tracking them down.

I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about face search technology lately, especially for things like matching photos across social media, helping find missing persons, or even connecting with long-lost friends. Has anyone here had success using face search or face recognition tools for any of these purposes? Any stories to share?

For context, I sent a selfie of this person to a friend through DM to see if they might know them, but no luck so far. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",1,1737482520.0,u_Ok-Reindeer-5844,0,1.0,False
1i6oruj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1i6oruj/help_me_find_paraguayan_food_please/,Help me find Paraguayan food PLEASE,"My wife is pregnant with massive cravings and we're stuck here until late February before we can go home.
 I need to find her a place with tradicional food from Paraguay and if possible a shop with food from there too. The most important thing I need right now is yerba mate and everything needed to make terer√©  and  cassava/yuca  starch. We couldn't find any of these things in the Latin American shops we found around town. And I know is almost impossible but we brought the stevia we use and tsa took it from us in the airport and she uses it for her coffee and tea and for our daughters food and now we can't and she can only buy stevia (and yerba mate) from Paraguay and won't touch the Argentinian or Brazilian version of both.
I know she sounds crazy but it's the pregnancy and her values talking and this point.

We found a restaurant with paraguayan food in Greenpoint Ave but the food wasn't that good, ran out or everything my wife was craving and service wasn't good.",2,1737482495.0,FoodNYC,3,1.0,False

Hi baby, not sure if you still celebrate it today or you use a Wiccan calendar now, excuse my ignorance. 

‚ÄúMay this day be blessed with gifts, lessons, understanding, and friends. May your energy be a gift to all you meet as it was the day we met. May you face the day with courage, kindness, insight, and compassion...even for Lions.  May our spirits and bodies find peace and honor this day, for it is **your day P**‚Äù

I wish I was with you gazing into your eyes peaceful and uninterrupted with a hot cup of coffee (black), bread and jam, and fresh fruit at my kitchen counter...the morning light refracting of the frost blanketing my back yard like tiny diamonds. 

I hope wherever you are this morning that you heart is light and you are happy today. 

I love you, truly, without reservation, and unconditionally,

1i6oo2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1i6oo2h/asked_to_meet_up_for_closure_and_she_threatened/,Asked to meet up for closure and she threatened to call the police,"After a rocky 2.5 year LDR in which she was secretly seeing another man for most of the time, I ended up in the city where we first met. (don't ask why it went on for 2.5 years -- it's complicated)

I didn't return to our city to see her necessarily, but to heal. To go back to all our old places and rewrite the traumatic memories I had. But in the back of my mind, I always thought it's possible I'd randomly see her while I was in town.

So for 2 months, as I tried to heal, I didn't contact her at all even though she consumed my thoughts. I was angry. I was sad. I wanted revenge. Every day sucked, not necessarily because I missed her, but because I was so mad at her and I wanted some type of justice. I smoked and drank almost every night.

I thought being in our old city would help me heal, and it did to some extent but it still felt ""off"" that I hadn't seen the woman I had been chatting with almost daily for 2.5 years. For some reason just seeing her once after so long without each other felt like the closure I needed.

So one night, after a couple bottles of wine, I texted her a friendly text. Just asking to meet up for a coffee in the friendliest way possible, no pressure.

Her response?

She was out of town with the other guy and if I message her again, she'll call the police, tell them I'm harassing her, and have them put me away.

I was shocked.

After all she put me through? To just threaten me like that?

But that was the closure I needed.

After that response, I'm officially over this person. I don't even want the coffee anymore. LOL

Not worth my time, and not worth yours either if you're going through something similar.

It's like a weight is lifted off my back.

Thank you to this subreddit for helping me heal.

I will be making my exit now. Cheers!",1,1737482256.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

Just a word of advice; In my personal experience if you have to fuel and prop up the conversation on the app, you‚Äôre going to be disappointed in person‚Ä¶ no matter how hot she looks. 

You can‚Äôt fake genuine chemistry and connection. 

She has quadruple more matches than you with a thousand pending messages. Half are already inlove with her and the other half are asking to see her feet slathered in maple syrup. 

If the date is not something basic like a coffee, a walk or a beer? Don‚Äôt waste your time or money. The probability of someone seeing you as a meal ticket is higher than you think. 

If the banter is not onpoint and natural, just unmatch and save yourself the headache. 

Lastly, Under no circumstances do not reveal in detail how much money you make, wealth background or what you exactly do for work.

1i6oixt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i6oixt/the_midnight_schoolbus/,The Midnight Schoolbus ,"When I was eight years old, I heard a tapping at my window. Now I was never a scared child. My dad was a self-proclaimed ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù who had, maybe unwisely, shown me all of the slasher classics before my sixth birthday. This all led to the type of kid who'd watch Stand By Me and be inspired to go look for a body himself. So when I heard that tapping at my bedroom window, I swung myself out of bed. 

I was determined to investigate its source. The fact that it just turned midnight and I was awake later than I usually ever am only added to the mystique. I slid my dinosaur shaped slippers on, crept over the scattered piles of lego to the other side of my room. Just before I peeled back the curtains, the tapping stopped. This brought my curiosity to a fever pitch and I yanked the curtains open. 

The first thing I noticed was that the window was wide open, stretching the hinges as far as they could go. I was hit with a whoosh of cold air and tightened my bathrobe in response. The second thing I noticed was the long, yellow school bus in the middle of my street, parked silently at the end of my driveway. 

What compelled me next was more than childlike wonder and a keen sense of adventure. I almost felt like I was being dragged by my ear as I climbed onto the window sill and fell out of my room into the night. I was soaked by the dew-covered grass of the front lawn, it was early July and the sprinklers were on full blast, but I didn't care all that much. I got to my feet, brushing the dirt and dandelions off myself, and made my way over to the bus.

There was no hum, no rattle of the exhaust. The bus was completely silent. I stood in front of the doors and tried to peer through the glass panels. They were so thick with grit and grime that I couldn't see anything. While I had my face cupped to them, the doors swung open. I jumped back, startled. I collected myself, and finally saw the interior. 

Inside, it was barely lit enough to see. A single electric bulb dangled in the center of the aisle. I stepped onto the bus to get a better look. The seats were a maroon leather and battered within an inch of their life. The metal floor was covered in rust and black grease. As far as I could make out, there were six other children. All of them were my age, all dressed in pajamas and shivering. None of them spoke when they noticed me.

I was about to get off when a voice made me jump out of my skin. I thought the driver's booth was empty, but now I could make out the figure of someone sitting at the wheel, shrouded in shadow. 

‚ÄúAre you staying on?‚Äù The person said in a gruff, genderless voice. 

The same feeling that had compelled me to climb out of my bedroom window and onto the bus likewise compelled me to reply ‚Äúyes‚Äù.

The mechanical whirring of the bus doors closing snapped me back to reality. I suddenly realised my mistake. I rushed to the booth‚Äôs window and pleaded with the driver. 

‚ÄúWait, wait, I've made a mistake! It's past my bedtime! Please sir, let me off.‚Äù I argued. 

The driver sniffed and said ‚ÄúCan't, you've already paid your fare. Go take a seat with the others.‚Äù 

I stumbled back as the bus roared silently into motion. I ran between the seats, watching my house slowly fade into the distance. I climbed onto the back seat and saw it disappear around a corner. I realised that at the back of the bus there were two other doors. My plans of escape were smothered when I saw the red emergency handle. It was bound in chains. 

I turned to run back to the driver when I saw someone I recognised. I walked over to her seat and sat next to her. She turned to look at me and my suspicions were confirmed. It was Marcy. She'd been in my class up until the beginning of this year, when her parents pulled out to homeschool her. 

‚ÄúMarcy?‚Äù I said softly. 

Marcy seemed perfectly calm. She was wearing pink pajamas decorated with a cartoon character I didn't recognise. She'd been humming to herself and swinging her legs back and forth. One of her unicorn slippers had fallen off, but she didn't seem to care.

‚ÄúOh, hiya Jake‚Äù She said, as if we'd just bumped into each other at a playground. 

‚ÄúWhat's going on?‚Äù I asked. 

‚ÄúWell, Mom and Dad told me that I had to go on this trip. They said something about a surprise party, but I don't know who's birthday it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour parents know about this?‚Äù  I pressed her for more information. 

‚ÄúOf course they do. They stayed up with me all night and brought me out to the bus when it came. Mom talked a lot with the driver. He seems nice. I think they're old friends or something.‚Äù 

I was oddly calmed by her explanation. If her parents knew, then maybe mine did. I sank into my chair as I began to accept what was going on. But there was one more question I needed to ask her. 

‚ÄúMarcy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you feel sleepy at all?‚Äù

Marcy scrunched up her face in thought, then looked at me and replied. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

I felt the same. I was up later than I had ever been yet I didn't feel tired at all. The opposite actually, I felt full of energy. Marcy started talking about something while she stroked her long, red hair, but I wasn't listening. I sat up in my seat, looking around at the five other children on the bus. From what I could make out, their emotions ranged from apathy to quiet terror. 

The bus rattled on for another twenty minutes. I felt the same feeling in my stomach as I did before a spelling test at school. I looked past Marcy and out the window. All I saw were trees. I didn't even know if we were still driving on an actual road anymore. I, and every other kid in the bus, jumped when the driver flicked on the radio. It played classical music, heavily diluted with static. After a while, the driver mumbled to himself and switched it off. 

Before long, the bus came to a halt. Instinctively, we all made our way out of the seats and up the aisle towards the door in a line. We all saw the man waiting for us outside. The doors began to open and, in single file, we made our way out. As I excited the bus, I gave a cautious glance back. The driver's booth was very clearly empty. 

The man waiting for us was surprisingly well dressed. His pinstripe suit made me instantly think of him as a banker. He looked young, but he was balding. What blond hair he had left was harshly slicked back against his scalp. I couldn't see his eyes past the circular, red lenses of his glasses. 

‚ÄúCome on children‚Äù, he said in a soft, calming voice, ‚Äúyou're all going to come with me now. 

With that, he began to lead us deeper into the forest. The other children fired one question after another at him, who he was and why we're here. Finally, it came my turn to tug at the hem of his jacket and ask him the first thing that came to mind. 

‚ÄúExcuse me, where are we going?‚Äù I asked.

He chuckled and ruffled my hair. 

‚ÄúWe're going to meet Oz.‚Äù He dutifully replied. 

Before I got a chance to ask him who Oz was, the particularly overweight boy next to me asked him his name. The man told us all his name was Horace, and that we should keep our questions to ourselves until we got to the party. 

I fell back a bit to walk next to Marcy. She still seemed as nonchalant about the whole thing as ever. 

‚ÄúHey Marcy, do you know someone called Oz?‚Äù

She thought long and hard and then told me that she didn't. We walked in silence for a while after that, until suddenly she spoke again.

‚ÄúI know Horace though,‚Äù she said. 

I looked at her dumbfounded. 

‚ÄúYou know him?‚Äù I said, gesturing towards the man who was walking a few paces in front of us, now holding the hand of one of the other children. 

‚ÄúWell, I don't know him,‚Äù she said with a shrug, ‚Äúbut he turned up at my house a few weeks ago. I'm pretty sure that was him. He just had a coffee with my parents and left.‚Äù 
She squinted her eyes thoughtfully and then said ‚ÄúYeah it was definitely him. He had the same glasses on.‚Äù 

After that, Marcy went back to picking petals from a flower she'd torn from the ground. I was trying to think of another question for her when suddenly, the group came to a stop. Me and Marcy had been walking at the back, and didn't notice when the kid at the front burst into tears. Horace crouched down next to him, putting an affirming hand on his shoulder. When the boy didn't immediately stop crying, Horace grew irate. It was clear that he didn't know how to handle children. 

‚ÄúWhat is kid?‚Äù He snapped. ‚ÄúHuh? Miss your fucking parents? Is that it?‚Äù

I'd gradually been desensitised to language like that at home, but the other kids around me, apart from Marcy, reacted like they'd been punched in the gut. Some physically recoiled. Horace stood up and continued. 

‚ÄúDo you want candy? Will that shut you up? Here, I've got candy.‚Äù 

With that, he stuffed his hand into his jacket pocket. After some rummaging, he pulled out a crumpled packet of apple flavoured chewing gum and, in a brittle attempt to buy his silence, forced it into the sobbing boy‚Äôs palm.
Amazingly, this didn't stop his wailing. Horace sighed intensely and turned to face the rest of us. 

‚ÄúAlright, everyone start moving.‚Äù He said with a wave of his hand. 

One by one, we started to follow him deeper into the forest, now driven by fear more than anything else. The boy at the front, who Marcy informed me was called Peter, had finally stopped crying. Horace kept a close eye on him. Every so often, he'd announce that we were almost there. I still didn't know what ‚Äúthere‚Äù was supposed to be. But as we passed through the tree line into a bizarre clearing, I found out. 

The grass was scorched. Etched into the ground was a symbol I would later learn was called a heptagram. This seven sided star must've been at least fifty feet in diameter, and was perfectly proportioned. Two dozen people in plain clothes were milling around the outskirts of the star, talking to each other or sipping from cans. They all stopped when they saw us emerging from the woods. Some clapped and cheered, all smiled. 

A man walked over to us, greeted Horace with a handshake and kneeled to talk to us at eye level. 

‚ÄúHey kids!‚Äù He said with a plastic grin ‚ÄúMy name is Capnion. Are you all excited for the big night?‚Äù

When none of us replied, he stood up and said ‚ÄúI'm sure you are.‚Äù

With that he turned to Horace and whispered something to him. Horace laughed and the pair began to walk off. Capnion turned back to us and said ‚ÄúYou all just wait patiently right there‚Äù, before following Horace to a group of men and women. I was so focused on the scene in front of me, that when Marcy spoke from just behind me, I almost had a heart attack. 

‚ÄúThat was my Sunday school teacher.‚Äù She said, staring blankly ahead. 

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I inquired ‚ÄúCapnion?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. And his name isn't Capnion,‚Äù she told me, ‚ÄúIt's Gary.‚Äù 

The group of us seven kids were waiting while the adults busied themselves, arranging small stones and sticks and lighting brass lanterns that dangled from every suitably sturdy tree branch. After some time, seven of the adults came over to us. They each took us by the hands and led us away from each other. The woman who came to me looked old, as far as I can remember. Her hair was a dark grey and tangled in unkempt dreadlocks. She wore a blue jacket over her floral summer dress and had more beads around her neck than I could count. Trying to put me at ease, she told me her name was Prasada. Even at the age I was then, I could tell she was lying, just like the rest of them. 

We came to a stop and I realised we were now standing on one point of the star. I looked around and saw that each point now bore a child. With that, the rest of the adults congregated in the center of the star. Prasada stood behind me, resting her hands on my shoulders. She began whispering her comfort, like my mother would if I had skinned my knee. I felt calm in that moment, like nothing could harm me. 

Prasada stroked my hair and in a low voice said ‚ÄúThere, there Jake, don't worry. It will all be over soon.‚Äù

How did she know my name?

Suddenly, my calm facade died. I realised what I was doing and where I was. I became a bundle of nerves and started crying. Prasada tried to reign me in, but I was beyond her reasoning. I wiggled violently from her hold as the chanting of the adults reached a deafening tumult. Steam began to rise from the ground. I didn't look back when I heard the other children scream briefly, I just kept running. 

Deep and deeper still I ran into the forest. My slippers had been lost in panic and my feet were a pin cushion of pine needles. I could hear people chasing after me, barking obscenities I knew I could never repeat to my parents. Away from the light of the gathering, I was now running in pitch darkness. Every few seconds I'd be bathed in the torch light of my pursuers and I would be forced to set a new course. Finally, the darkness began to give way. 

I burst out of the treeline onto a road. Directly across from me was the neon embrace of a gas station. The automatic doors hid me inside and I didn't stop running until I reached the counter. I was met with a very confused looking woman. At seven, everyone looks like a giant. Thinking back on it, she must've only been in her late teens. I managed to articulate that I needed to call my parents. She took out her Nokia and asked me for the number. I panicked as I realised I didn't know it, but she calmed me down by telling me that we could just call 911.

A single police car turned up twenty minutes later. It was a long night only made longer by the policeman's poor attempt and trying to communicate with a child. Eventually, my parents arrived and showered me in warmth and kindness. The next morning, I woke up in my own bed, in my own house, happily thinking that the night before was just a bad dream. 

That night was the first time I feared death. It was a feeling that, thankfully, I would feel again. Until now. At the tender age of twenty-five, I have been diagnosed with stage four brain cancer. Glioblastoma multiforme. Only a quarter of those diagnosed see the end of the year. My doctor informed me bluntly that my tumor had no possibility of being removed, and the best they could do was regular chemotherapy sessions which would hopefully shrink it to a manageable size. At the behest of my already grieving parents, I took the offer. 

In this case, the treatment felt worse than the illness itself. It came with constant fatigue, mouth ulcers, the worst headaches of my life and more. A few days ago, my hair began to fall out. I opted to cut the rest off. My nurse came to me with a shaver and I joked that I'd like a number two. We laughed as she wrapped a towel around me and began to cut away the remainder of my once thick head of hair. 

Before long, she remarked ‚ÄúQuirky tattoo. Where'd you get it?‚Äù

I told her that I didn't have any tattoos and she joked that I must've been drinking a lot the night I got it. We laughed again, my sense of humour the one thing not affected by chemo, and she handed me a mirror. I held it out in front of me to admire her handy work. 

Engraved into my scalp was an incomplete heptagram. One of its points was missing, leaving it in imperfect symmetry. From deep within me, I realised what it will take to fill it in.

We both separately have used a Delonghi Stilosa for years and honestly getting pretty decentish espresso (at least to our unrefined heathen coffee palates.) I don't need to be an expert right now at anything, I'm willing to put in some more money to get a decent grinder for her at some point and start trying out the unpressurized basket with fresh beans, but for right now realistically she's gonna use pre-ground Lavassa with the pressurized portafiler setup for the near future.

With all that said, I am only expecting the at least the same or slightly better quality espresso than the Delonghi made with the same pre-ground coffee, not expecting to be spiritually transformed by the espresso experience (my apologies). So, I have pulled some decent tasting espresso but I have noticed that it tastes watery/weak in comparison to the Delonghi, which I'm thinking is just user error here and getting used to the machine. It doesn't have a PID but I have followed the basic steps to temperature surf and have let everything including the portafilter itself warm up a good amount of time. I have tried various amounts of coffee but am not weighing it, I basically started off accidentally overfilling it I believe, then I tried checking to see if the shower head screw makes a mark in the puck when I put it in, and then putting slightly less until it doesn't make a mark anymore when I first put it in. The other thing is I think that I may need a new shower screen because it came backwards and I might have wrecked it by popping it in the other direction at first. I've tried tamping both conservatively and super hard. This is also the model that already has the 9 bar OPV, but it seems to be pulling the shots way too quickly resulting in weaker espresso. However I will say I'm getting a decent crema and the espresso itself tastes very nice as in not bitter or sour at all, but it's just a little watery/weak in comparison.
 
I have read that the Gaggia is one of the best entry level ""real"" espresso machines but it was designed in mind for pre ground coffee users as well - in your guys opinion, am I just gonna have to get used to the machine and I'll start getting better shots, or is there something I have neglected in the process? Or am I possibly just used to the taste of burnt bitter overpressurized espresso from the Delonghi and an actual good espresso is tasting watery to me? Or is it possible that the shower screen could be causing channeling and making it weaker? Any advice is welcome for this mediocre barista thank you in advance.

TLDR: Refurbished Gaggia Classic Pro Evo 9 bar OPV, using pre ground coffee and getting weak shots, is it the shower screen or user error or an heathen espresso palate used to bitter shots?",1,1737481883.0,gaggiaclassic,2,1.0,False

We were very close and we had clear feelings for each other, but nothing really happened between us back then. I blame it on myself, i had zero ""game"" and was terrified of intimacy. I still do to a lesser degree. I've had a few short relationships between then and now, but nothing lasting, or fulfilling.



Last week i got a message from her. She just got divorced and has a kid. I took it as a clear sign that she's giving me a second chance, even if she hasn't stated it and seems to be purposefully avoiding any displays of affection in these messages. So of course i asked her out immediately.



We met at a coffee shop and had a pleasant time catching up, talking about the old times, work and family mostly, and she had to leave a couple of hours later. I messaged her the next day just to say i enjoyed being with her and if she'd like to have dinner soon. She told me she's too busy this week and that she'd get back to me.



Now i'm sure this can be true, but i can't help feeling like maybe i just didn't push things forward enough and she might never give me another chance again. After all, this felt more like a friendly catch-up than a date. And i have a terrible record with her.



The problem is i don't know how to go about it. I'm asexual and i fear this will be a deal-breaker for her. But i still want to explore the possibility that it can work. I don't see how i can approach that issue with her at the moment. I don't want to waste her time, but i don't want to break it to her too soon and scare her away either. So i'm taking things slow. But taking things slow itself can be the deal-breaker. Although her divorce is pretty fresh and it was likely messy (I didn't ask for details), so it's probably best for her to take small steps too.



She knows how i feel about her. I told her everything years ago. I don't see the point in opening up about it again. If anything i want to defuse that tension. All i care about is being with her as often as possible and let things flow naturally and give her feelings for me a chance to grow. If i try to force it right away i suspect she'll just tell me she's not ready.



But i'm scared shitless of losing her again, by again not making enough moves. So i'm torn. I know that we both don't want a second date where we just talk about work and family again, that's for sure. But i'm not certain how to ""break the ice"" gently.

First stop is Kingsbarns, just outside of St. Andrews.  This was right after the Alfred Dunhill classic had wrapped, so pin positions were brutal.  If you go to Scotland, you have to play this course.  Cost was around $400USD, and a caddie is absolutely the right move.  Mild to strong cross winds are standard, and an iron off the tee is a great choice on many of the holes (like many courses in scotland).

Second stop, a lesser known or talked about course is Crail Golfing Society.  Its about 20 minutes away from St. Andrews in the most southern point of Fife.  This was a recommendation from a Scot who said its a hidden gem.  This was also the cheapest i played, approximately $85USD.  A caddie wasn't needed for this club, but you can't go wrong with getting one.  This was golf in its purest form.  They have two courses, we chose the Craighead links as the Balcomie Links was booked.  The Balcomie course dates back to 1895 and was significantly shorter than Craighead.  I would add this to your list if you ever come out this way as it has no glitz or glamour, just great golf!

Third stop was the Old Course;  We didnt prebook, but we did go put in the lottery the day before.  You have to get your submission in before the 5pm cut off.  You get notified within 60 minutes or so if you got it or if you are waitlisted.  If you are waitlisted, you join the others and hope to god that people chose not to show up, however unlikely it is.  We were fortunate and we got an early morning tee time.  This was the coldest day and the most wind we faced on our entire trip, gusts up to 40mph.  A caddie makes the experience more enjoyable, but not completely necessary.  Look, it's the Old Course, the home of golf, and for that it was totally worth it.  Personally, i found the course to be a little boring, which others had echoed the sentiment.  If you come, you absolutely have to play it because of the history.

Explore the town of St. Andrews, its amazing.  Great food, great pubs, tons of old world charm.  A splurge dinner recommendation would be The Seafood Restaurant, right behind the R&A building. 

Fourth stop was an hour drive west to Gleneagles.  This by far, is the most expensive stay & play, but absolutely worth it. Round was roughly $450USD.  I would argue you could do an entire trip and just stay here.  Three courses, Kings Course, Queens Course, & Centenary Course.  Kings Course & Queens Course are more traditional, and the Centenary course is more American golf.  We chose the Queens course, and she didn't disappoint.  You need a caddie, don't even think.  Scottish highlands golf is tough, but fun.  Narrow fairways, greens don't make sense, but an absolute treat.

Stay at the hotel, its probably one of the nicest facilities in the world, complete with Michelin star restaurant and a slew of pubs. 

  
Fifth and final stop was Trump Turnberry and the Aisla course on the west coast of Scotland in Aylshire. Everything aside, this was buy far...the best golf course i've ever played in my life. Round was approximately $450USD. We stayed at the hotel, and it was lackluster.  Service was great, but everything seemed confusing, or not well planned.  If you decide to go, i'd make it a day trip as it was only 2-ish hours away from Gleneagles (3 from St. Andrews)  and the hotel is expensive.  The golf however, was perfect.  So much history, views that never end.  Fun facts about the place.  The half way house has two rooms that you can rent if you choose to stay, was out of my price range.  The ruins of Robert the Bruce's castle sit on the side of the 10th tee.  The golf was just fantastic, i can't say enough.

A few other items to note:

  
\- Much like the other guy said, caddie fees are paid directly to the caddie.  A 20-30$ or pound tip is pretty standard.  Offer to buy them something if you stop at the halfway house, most just want a tea or coffee.  Occasionally if you buy some swing lubricant, you get a caddie who will partake.

\- Practice. putting.  I can't stress this enough.  You can't hope you can make an 80 ft putt, you need to practice.  

\- We didn't use a service to book, we just did research for a few months and built our itinerary.

\- We rented a car, but for all that is holy don't fly RyanAir during a airport worker strike that delays your flight 3 hours and lands you at midnight when its raining and foggy and then you have to drive from Edinburgh to St. Andrews in the middle of the night.  Scotland doesn't like street lights and cars are parked in the road.   

  
Hope this helps anyone thinking about it!  Don't waste time, go do it, you will not regret it.

I can't remember when it first started but I would say somewhere in my teen years (I'm 35F now) only a few times a year, but over time it has gotten worse, more instances of pulsatile tinnitus to the point where, in the past year, it's almost every night. It only ever affects me at night and only in my left ear. I'm so sick of hearing or reading ""meditation"" or ""breathing techniques"" as solutions because I'M TRYING TO SLEEP, I'M ALREADY RELAXED, and having a fan on or white noise doesn't help because obviously a sound directly at my eardrum is much louder than anything else. 

My mom has high-blood pressure, but I do not, mine is a low-average, no disease, medical conditions or anything else of note in my medical history. I'm technically overweight but still easily sub-200. 

I've seen ENT (zero help), had an MRA done (found nothing), and a couple weeks ago I made another appointment with a different ENT doctor. Sometime last year I bought Soundcore Sleep A20 earbuds, I wear one in my left ear, that was a godsend for a while but coincidentally right after my MRA it got worse again. 

So I was talking with my mom after scheduling with the second ENT Dr, she mentioned my soda intake, 3-4 cans of Diet Coke a day approximately, but I've already switched to caffeine-free Diet Coke, the only other caffeine I ever have is one coffee in the morning on weekdays. But mom reminded me that my dad had to stop drinking soda a couple decades ago, something medical related, and more recently one of my brothers as well (who was an avid Mountain Dew drinker) for unknown reasons. I LOVE Diet Coke, but at this point I gotta try anything for my own sanity. I can't quit cold turkey, but I can drop down to one or two cans a day.

First night after first day of dropping soda intake, ok maybe a tiny bit better but some nights are actually better than others. Second night, ok maybe there is something to this. Third night, only one hour-ish long instance of pulsatile tinnitus. Fourth night and on, NO PULSATILE TINNITUS AT ALL.

Cutting your soda intake is a healthy choice anyways but I love my diet coke so much, I had to be forced into it. It might not be soda for everyone, but I wanted to share just in case it helps anyone.",2,1737481247.0,PulsatileTinnitus,0,1.0,False

I was on the fence about having a shower at all, then came down just slightly on the side of Yes. Booked at a local coffee/breakfast spot that I had been to several times, although I had not seen their private event area. Big mistake. I finally went to check it out over the weekend and it‚Äôs just not going to work at all, it looks nothing like the rest of the restaurant and it‚Äôs too small for the capacity they originally claimed, so I cancelled (and forfeit my booking fee.)

Shower is supposed to be on 2/16. I could reserve our neighborhood clubhouse and host it there for fairly cheap if we do pizza/beer. But I don‚Äôt know if I have the time or motivation to re-plan this whole thing, especially at a DIY space without staff or supplies to help. We still have so many other things to do to prep for baby and this feels like a distraction.

My mom and MiL are pressuring me to book something and saying they‚Äôll help, but I know I would just end up coordinating/OK‚Äôing everything anyway. My husband says whatever I want to do is fine.

Should I just take the money we would have spent on a shower and use it to buy the stuff on our registry myself? Will I regret this? I feel so guilty because my baby deserves to be celebrated and this is probably our only chance to have a shower, but it just seems like SO much work.

If I didn‚Äôt have to do the work and could just show up to a shower I would actually enjoy I would be all for it, but I don‚Äôt trust my mom to plan it (she was SHOCKED AND APPALLED that I was going to invite MEN to a BABY SHOWER and is definitely picturing the old-fashioned ‚Äútea and finger sandwiches with the ladies while they watch me open presents‚Äù kind of event) and at this point I don‚Äôt have the mental bandwidth to DIY, or the budget to hire help.

**2025's Best Bird Feeder Window Options: Reviews & Comparisons to Attract‚Äå Birds Closer!**

for nature enthusiasts,‚Å§ backyard bird watchers, and anyone who appreciates ‚Å§the beauty of wildlife, bringing birds closer to your living space can be a ‚Å§truly rewarding experience. ‚Å¢The ability to observe thes fascinating creatures up close, from the‚Å£ comfort of your own home, is now easier ‚Äåthan‚Å£ ever with a bird feeder window.  As we move into 2025, the ‚Äåmarket for these fantastic devices continues to evolve, offering a wider array‚Äã of options than ever before. ‚ÄãThis article will delve into the best window‚Äç bird feeder options available, exploring their features, benefits, and addressing ‚Äãkey concerns, such as durability and squirrel‚Å¢ protection. We‚Äôll guide you through choosing the‚Å¢ perfect clear bird feeder window to enhance your view and the life in your garden.

**Why Choose a ‚ÄçWindow Bird Feeder?**

There‚Äôs a certain ‚Å£magic in watching a tiny chickadee land just inches ‚Äãfrom your windowpane. Unlike conventional garden bird feeders, window mounted bird feeders offer unparalleled viewing opportunities. They‚Äôre ideal for those who lack garden‚Äã space or for anyone wanting an unobstructed,up-close outlook on their avian‚Å§ visitors. Imagine enjoying your morning coffee while‚Å£ observing a vibrant cardinal enjoying its breakfast, or teaching children about the different species of birds that frequent ‚Äåyour neighborhood. These moments of connection with nature are invaluable‚Äå and enriching. Furthermore, they‚Äôre often easier to fill ‚Å§and clean compared to freestanding ‚Äåoptions, making them a low-maintenance choice for‚Å§ many. A small window bird feeder can transform even the most modest‚Äå space into a thriving bird-watching haven.

**Key Features ‚Äçto Consider When Choosing‚Äç a Window Bird Feeder**

Selecting the ideal ‚Å£window bird‚Äã feeder for‚Äã your home involves several key factors.Durability is essential; the feeder‚Äå needs to withstand the elements ‚Äì rain, wind, and varying temperatures.  look for a durable window bird feeder crafted from robust materials such as acrylic or ‚Äåperspex, which is not only strong but also provides a clear, unobstructed view of the birds. The quality of suction cups is another critical consideration. They must ‚Äåbe strong ‚Å¢enough to securely ‚Äãattach your feeder‚Å¢ to the glass, even when it's ‚Äåfull‚Äç of seed, thereby assuring the safety of your little feathered friends. A‚Äç well-designed ‚Äçattachable bird ‚Å§feeder will ‚Äãuse‚Äç multiple, high-quality suction cups to‚Äå provide adequate support.Always check reviews on the suction power of the feeder you are interested in.

Easy cleaning is paramount‚Äå for maintaining a hygienic environment for‚Äå the birds and also for your‚Å§ peace ‚Å¢of mind -- the easiest models‚Å§ have removable‚Å§ trays and ‚Å£avoid intricate ‚Äådesigns where grime can accumulate‚Å¢ easily. if you‚Äç live in an area‚Å£ with squirrels, choosing a squirrel proof window bird feeder is a crucial‚Å£ measure.Some feeders are designed to deter these clever‚Äç critters with a design that makes access very difficult, while some may fail to deter determined ones.For ‚Å£this reason, it is important to consider the type and size of the bird feeder when ‚Äçlooking for a squirrel ‚Äãproof option.

**Materials for‚Å¢ the Best Window view**

The material of‚Å£ the bird‚Äå feeder plays a‚Äã vital role ‚Äåin ‚Å§both durability and visibility. Acrylic and perspex, commonly used in many clear bird feeder window designs, are excellent options for providing unobstructed ‚Å£views. ‚ÄåThese materials are not only clear but also robust and weather-resistant. Acrylic, in particular,‚Å£ offers extraordinary clarity and is relatively lightweight, making‚Äã it ideal for window-mounted applications. A see through bird feeder crafted from high-quality, UV-resistant acrylic won't‚Å§ yellow ‚Å§or become brittle over time due to prolonged exposure to sunlight.‚Å¢ This is ‚Äãsignificant, as it ‚Äçensures both aesthetics and durability for long term ‚Å¢enjoyment. Another major advantage ‚Å£is its resistance to shattering compared to glass, making it a safer option, especially ‚Äåin households ‚Äãwith children or pets.

**Suction Power and Mounting Stability: Prioritizing Safety**

The importance of secure suction cannot be overstated when it comes‚Å§ to a‚Å§ secure‚Äã window bird feeder. No one wants‚Äå a bird feeder that crashes to the ground unexpectedly. Opting‚Å§ for‚Äã feeders with multiple high-quality suction cups is vital; four or five are certainly preferable to‚Å£ just two or ‚Å¢three. Some models, especially higher end window bird feeders , utilize specialized EVERGRIP suction cups designed ‚Äãfor superior hold and longevity. Always make sure the glass is clean and dry‚Å§ before attaching the feeder, this ensures the maximum suction power‚Å§ and reduces the chances of accidental detachments. Some users prefer to wet the suction cups of the feeder lightly before‚Äå attaching ‚Äåthem to the well cleaned window glass for‚Äå optimal adherence.

**Easy ‚ÄåCleaning: Ensuring a Healthy Bird Feeding Environment**

A ‚Äåfrequently neglected but essential aspect of bird feeder maintenance is ease of cleaning.  An easy to clean bird feeder window is important for both the health of the birds and ease‚Äå of maintenance for the owner.Designs, such‚Å§ as‚Å§ those with‚Äç removable trays, ‚Å§simplify the process, allowing you to remove old seed debris, bird droppings and prevent the build-up of bacteria that can spread diseases to birds. ‚Å¢Smooth‚Äç surfaces and minimal crevices help in this cleaning process. Remember,‚Äç a ‚Å¢clean feeder is a healthy feeder. Consider ‚Å£washing your bird feeder at least once every two weeks,‚Å§ or more frequently during the rainy months where bacteria ‚Äåand mold can ‚Å§thrive.

**Squirrel-Proofing Your window Bird Feeder**

Squirrels, even though some ‚Å§might ‚Å£call them adorable,‚Äã can‚Äç be a ‚Äåtrue challenge for maintaining a ‚Å¢functional bird feeder.‚Å£ They‚Äôre ‚Äçintelligent, agile, and incredibly persistent. Some squirrel proof window bird feeder options include designs ‚Äãincorporating wire mesh or metal‚Äå components to prevent access to the bird seed. Another approach focuses on feeders attached a sufficient‚Äã distance‚Äã from the window ledge or roof, ‚Å¢depriving squirrels from a‚Äã jumping platform to reach the feeder. The ‚Äçeffectiveness of any anti-squirrel measure depends greatly on your location and the squirrel's determination, thus, a‚Å§ combination of these is ‚Å¢a ‚Å£more sure approach.

**Exploring the Options: Some Top Contenders**

Several models stand out in the market as great options for a window mounted feeder. The ""Entirely Zen"" model is well received‚Å¢ due to‚Äå its clear and unobscured view,‚Äã with a focus on a‚Äç design without any suction cup interference in the ‚Å¢viewing area; it has a removable ‚Å£two-compartment tray for easy‚Äç cleaning. Other exceptional choices‚Äã frequently enough feature reinforced suction cup technology‚Å§ for better longevity and reliability over the years. Many acrylic bird feeder designs offer durability and ‚Å§great‚Å§ viewing angles,and are ‚Å§often equipped with drainage holes to avoid the collection of rainwater inside the ‚Äçbird feeder. Remember to check customer reviews carefully, focusing on durability, suction, and how‚Å£ easy it is ‚Äåto maintain the feeder.**Making an Informed Purchase: Where to Buy**

The ""buy window bird feeder"" search can lead you‚Å§ to a variety of retailers.Online marketplaces, such as‚Äå Amazon, offer a broad selection and competitive pricing,‚Äç while brick-and-mortar stores and garden centers provide the opportunity to look at the product in person prior to buying. When searching for ""where to buy window‚Äå bird ‚Äçfeeder"", keep in mind that‚Å§ product availability may vary depending on location .Always compare prices, check customer reviews, and consider the brand's reputation, before making a purchase. Look for the‚Äç best price‚Äç window bird feeder to gain ‚Å£the most value for the cost. Don‚Äôt be‚Å¢ afraid to also look at ""window bird feeder for sale"" listings on online marketplaces for extra savings, but remember that not all of them are worth ‚Å§the investment. It is wise to not only look at ""affordable window bird feeder"" listings‚Äç but also think about the quality of the brand ‚Äçfirst.

**Enhancing the Bird Watching Experience‚Å£ with  a Bird watching Window Feeder**

Beyond simply feeding birds, a window bird feeder can enhance your overall bird watching experience. You can now observe the behavior of your avian‚Äç visitors ‚Å¢up‚Äå close, taking particular note ‚Äçof their feeding habits, grooming rituals, and social interactions. This‚Å£ makes ""bird watching window feeder"" devices a fantastic tool for nature education, encouraging children to connect with the‚Å§ outdoors, and becoming more knowledgeable ‚Äåof local bird species, their diet ‚Å¢and behaviours. With a clear bird feeder window, photography enthusiasts can ‚Å¢also capture stunning pictures without worrying about ‚Äçmovement or the distractions of the outside. Bird identification of the ‚Å£different local species in your ‚Å§area is only more interesting and fun with a great bird feeder window.

**Conclusion: Bringing nature Closer to Home in 2025**

The market for window bird feeders is ‚Äãthriving, offering a vast range of models ‚Å¢to fit every need ‚Å£and budget. From the simple, affordable window bird feeder, for starters, to the elegant, ""premium"" feeders for more elegant backyard bird watchers, there's an ‚Å¢option for everyone. By ‚Äãcarefully considering factors‚Å§ such as material strength, suction cup‚Å¢ reliability‚Äå and squirrel-proofing features, consumers ‚Å§can choose a product that brings joy, satisfaction and a closer connection to nature through‚Å£ a clear bird feeder window. ‚ÄåInvesting in a high-quality bird feeder window can‚Å£ truly enhance your recognition ‚Äåfor birds and‚Äã the natural world, turning every day into an‚Äç enchanting bird-watching experience. In 2025, let's make ‚Å£our homes more welcoming for birds, and enjoy the‚Äå privilege ‚Å¢of watching ‚Äåthem up close.

Modern rustic living room ideas are the perfect blend of contemporary sleekness and cozy, natural elements. This style effortlessly combines the best of both worlds‚Äîclean lines and minimalist aesthetics with rustic textures like wood, stone, and organic fabrics.

Start by incorporating a neutral color palette with shades of white, beige, and gray to create a serene backdrop. Layer in natural materials like reclaimed wood beams, a stone fireplace, or a jute rug to infuse rustic charm. Add modern furniture pieces with simple designs, such as a mid-century modern sofa or a sleek coffee table, to maintain a contemporary feel.

For that extra cozy vibe, don‚Äôt forget to accessorize with soft throws, fluffy cushions, and ambient lighting. A mix of industrial lighting fixtures and soft, warm lamps can create the perfect balance of modern and rustic.

1i6o4wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1i6o4wb/blue_coffee_is_technically_the_goat_in_aoe2/,Blue_coffee is technically the GOAT in aoe2,"Hear me out. Pros usually play under very specific circumstances, as in 1v1 with diplomacy turned off. Given age of empires 2 has a diplomacy feature, you could argue they are playing with limited settings. I've seen Hera play in diplomacy games and players just formed a coallition against him and defeated him. So in that sense Hera is good at 1v1's, but in a game with diplomacy he struggles more (as in with the full set of features, max players, diplomacy enabled etc)

This really makes me think that Blue\_coffee in theory is the goat at age of empires. Most players play casually with friends or against ai, which is similar to how Blue\_coffee operates. Blue\_coffee also always makes other players ""play his game"", even if he loses. They are forced to sort of play the way he wants to play. 

While Hera may be the best at 1v1, I fully believe that Blue\_coffee is the greatest age of empires player of all time given he has mastered the game with full settings. Hes like the ""mma"" fighter of aoe2, as hera is a boxer (playing with limited settings). Although Hera is more skilled at 1v1's, I believe Blue\_coffe is more skilled in the overall game.

Woke up this morning after a long flight into a different world. This is not the same world it was a week ago. Nothing prepares you seeing your Mother in a casket. The Woman who was the witness of your entire life, from the moment you arrived and every second afterwards, she witnesses you with that love that is 2nd to none. Now I feel like it's just me for the rest of this journey. I feel detached, reckless, indifferent, deep sorrow. Even the most mundane things that she did, said, or had, have become sacred now, because they will never happen again. There will never be another email. Another text. Another champion in my corner who will support me through everything, every time, no matter what. The central pillar that supported my entire life just suddenly disappeared. Denial is beneficial, I can function as normal much of the day, but I know all I can do is unconditionally accept as this is part of the journey in this strange world, and cry when I need to cry. 

Walking through her house, seeing her new comfortable shoes she was telling me about a few weeks ago, sitting there by the door. Half of her sandwich in the fridge. Her laptop at the table. A cup of coffee. the sun-catcher I gave her 30+ years ago hanging in the kitchen window. How can these things be now untouched by her, ever again, but only forever? The knick-knacks that she decorated her bathroom with, that I found a bit tacky, were full of meaning now, and painful too look at. 

I feel grateful because I really do know I will see her again, and that she is with me. I feel grateful that I'm not overwhelmed and swept away in sorrow, that's so far I'm able to handle it. I know the depths of this grief and sorrow can only happen when there's profound love, so I allow it and feel it fully, but it's a different world.",5,1737480931.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

Once a week, sometimes 2, I care for a woman in her 40‚Äôs who is paralyzed on one side after having 3 debilitating strokes. She lives in her home with an able bodied partner and an able bodied teenage daughter. 

My client‚Äôs partner and teenager have become an issue for me.  I caught on too late that they expect me to clean up after them too. When I show up for her visits, there‚Äôs always trash AROUND the trash can and on the kitchen counter, again, RIGHT NEXT TO the trashcan. I find dishes scattered all over the place with food in them and surgery coffee drinks half drank all over the house, attracting bugs. It took me a few visits to realize that her other caregivers weren‚Äôt slacking off,  they simply refuse to be the household maid for her partner and kid. 

My client has a bedridden parent who has a couple of caregivers who come in and I‚Äôve gotten to know one of them fairly well. She was telling me that after the family had come over for the holidays, both times; they left everything for her to clean up, and not a single person even threw away their own plates/garbage. 

The straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was the other day when I showed up to find several mostly full take out containers open on the kitchen counter. Thinking they were just forgotten about, I put them back in the fridge. My clients partner freaked out and explained that the food was old and needed to be thrown away. In the trash can‚Ä¶ that he was currently‚Ä¶ standing NEXT TO!!! I was so dumbfounded that I just stared at him, then stared at the mess, then at the trash can and back at him. Not surprising, coming from a man who can‚Äôt perform the strenuous task of putting his dishes in the dishwasher, choosing to instead leave them on the counter NEAR the dishwasher for me to take care of. Couldn‚Äôt even put a dish in the dishwasher! He didn‚Äôt even have to run it! 

I really like working with my client. She spends most of her time in her bedroom, so I genuinely don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs fully aware of the problem. I don‚Äôt want to create an awkward situation or be accusatory even though it‚Äôs clear what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôve already decided that the logical first step is to notate this from now on when I submit my client visit notes for the day so the company I work for can see why certain things aren‚Äôt being done. 

I just need some advice on how to handle this delicately, and not have it seem like I‚Äôm just trying to be lazy or petty.

It delves into their workflows, functionalities, and significance within network communication and finally the article provides the answers for [TryHackMe Networking Essentials](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/networkingessentials) room.

**DHCP Protocol Explained**

To access a network, certain configurations must be set up at a minimum:

* **IP address and subnet mask**
* **Router (gateway)**
* **DNS server**

Whenever a device connects to a new network, these settings need to align with that network. Manually configuring them is ideal for devices like servers, which are stationary and do not frequently change networks. Servers typically have fixed IP addresses to ensure other devices can consistently locate them for communication. For instance, you wouldn't connect your domain controller to a coffee shop's WiFi.

However, automating network configuration offers several benefits. It eliminates the need for manual setup, which is especially useful for mobile devices, and prevents IP address conflicts. An address conflict occurs when two devices share the same IP, disrupting network access for both local and Internet resources. This problem can be addressed with **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**.

1i6nx8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i6nx8i/my_37f_bf_34m_has_broken_up_with_me_his_mum_is/,"My (37f) bf (34m) has broken up with me, his mum is dying and he has been seeing someone new. Still living together and want to work things out. Can anyone please advise on how I should proceed? ","My (37f) bf( 34m) of 4.5 years has broken up with me 3 weeks ago and I am totally lost. This was just after Christmas. We agreed to spend 30th December together to celebrate and have our own Christmas. Since my parents died (dad in 2022 and mum in 2023) I have not been celebrating Christmas day. This is because he spends it with his mum and dad and while I was always welcome I found the day incredibly difficult so I chose to visit their grave during the day and spend the evenings with him. This Christmas I wanted to make it special so we agreed to save presents etc. until 30th and cook a big dinner and try and make the day special. 

So the day comes around and he sleeps in until the afternoon. This is common but I was a little bit annoyed but due to his job and his shift pattern his sleeping schedule is all over the place. He apologised and we moved on without any arguments or sour words. We exchanged presents later in the day and he wrote me a card. The card contained some kind words but nothing sentimental and he did not write that he loves me. This is huge as he has not said it in a year but had still been writing it in cards for my birthday and our anniversary. For context last year around the beginning of February he broke up with me for 3 months and has not said it to me since we got back together. I continued to live with him as the only other option for me is to live in my parents house but this would be incredibly difficult for me as I watched them both take their last breaths there. He broke up with me then because he said the fighting and the relationship wasn't working anymore. I was hurt but essentially I agreed and we continued to live together but maintain separate lives. I took a trip to Spain on my own and eventually we started eating meals together, watching TV etc and it felt more like a relationship. His birthday was in April and I chose to decorate the house and get him some small gifts and decided to go for dinner. We slept together that day and from then had been back together. 

Since we got back together he has not said he loves me and we have not slept together since that one time last April. He did try and initiate sex once after that but I needed a shower and felt uncomfortable. The relationship has been stable with little arguments and everything had just been fine.

Around 2 weeks ago his mum was taken into hospital and the family have been told that she will not make it. It is essentially a waiting game now and she is expected to live another 1-2 weeks. I found out she had went to hospital the day before my bf got the flu so naturally I forgot about what had happened between us and took to looking after him. I brought him food to bed, ran him baths, bought him medicine and all the other things to help him get better. I have wanted to be here for him and support him while his mum is dying as I have been through it and he was very supportive of me.

On Sunday he got up (early for him). I was downstairs and heard the shower so I panicked and thought that his mum had passed. I went upstairs and he was getting ready and told me he was going for coffee on his own to clear his head. I thought it was strange but these are strange times so thought nothing of it. I went into the bathroom to clean up for him. I was going anything to help him during this time and his apple watch was on the the window sill. I saw there was a message from a girl I'd never heard of. I didn't read it but I had a feeling in my gut so I confronted him about it and eventually he admitted he was going to me her. I was angry and wanted answers. I begged him not to go but he left anyway. I couldn't sit still so I went for a drive and to my parents grave. When I got home he was there and I found out she was a girl from work and he had kissed her. He has told her about me and about my mum and dad. This deeply hurt me as losing them was the darkest period of my life. He slept on the sofa and I went to bed. I fell asleep but woke up screaming (this has happened before due to stress) and he came up and sat with me for a bit. He went back downstairs and I didn't sleep at all.

I asked him not to see her or message her until after I had left the house. I said it would be a few weeks until I could get sorted out and he promised me he wouldn't. I asked about the funeral and he said she might be there. I asked if he wanted me there and he said so I told him that we both can't be there. We have been together for 4.5 years and this girl has just appeared. She hasn't met his mum or his family. It feels like a dagger in my heart. 

Essentially I am lost. I don't know if I should continue to be there for him and attend the funeral or just leave. If it were me, he would be the only one I want around. He is not opening up to me but has opened up to her and I don't know what my place is. I am just lost. The relationship has been rocky and at times he has been been emotionally and verbally abusive (stonewalling, name-calling, screaming etc.) but we had moved past that and that side of the relationship has improved.

I still love him very much and I want to work things out but he simply does not. I had been hoping that what has happened with the other girl was due to his mum dying but I don't know. I can't eat or sleep. I don't know what to do without him and feel lost without my parents. I don't want to imagine my life without him. I will be extremely lonely and heartbroken. I WFH most of the time and sometimes from week to week he is the only person I see. I don't want to continue on living without him. I am sorry the post is so long and a bit messy. I could write a book but I need advice. It appears as though he going to pursue a relationship with this girl and told me he has feeling for her.

1i6nq5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1i6nq5i/i_feel_crazy_and_ridiculous/,I feel crazy and ridiculous ,"Hi everyone. I often lurk in this community but don‚Äôt comment. I‚Äôve just been doing through a doozy the last couple days and wanted to know if anyone had advice.

I‚Äôm 23, almost 24. I have extremely little romantic experience (one date with kissing). Some of it has been lack of interest (there was a borderline situationship but I stepped out of that), dealing with my other mental health issues, and also plain avoidance. I have this irrational fear of men due to how abusive and crazy my dad got, and how aggressive and chaotic my older brother got. I know it‚Äôs not fair to feel this with all men. I do have male friends. 

I met this guy at a birthday party Saturday evening. He‚Äôs 4-5 years older. We clicked, I think! We‚Äôve been chatting on Insta since and yesterday evening he very politely asked to continue the conversation over coffee next Sunday. All great. 

 So what the FUCK is wrong with me?

When I first got his message, raw panic spiraled through me. I felt unsafe and trapped. I wanted to flee. When I let the initial wave pass, I was pleased by his message. But I swing from being happy to panicked. I‚Äôm so ashamed of my brain. There‚Äôs nothing to be panicked over! Why am I doing this? My dad was one of those psychopath types that hid his evil until it was too late, so I get paranoid and wary. But I literally met this man at my friend/coworker‚Äôs birthday party and they‚Äôve been friends for years!

Then I go into a shame cycle. Like how broken I must be. How irrational and stupid. That I‚Äôm ridiculous for thinking someone will want to date me because I‚Äôm so fucked up! I have PTSD, depression, ADHD, and autism. Yes, I‚Äôm in therapy, and yes, I‚Äôm medicated, but it‚Äôs been a real struggle, especially lately. I‚Äôm trying so hard but I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt date until I‚Äôm ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù That nobody will want me with these struggles (I don‚Äôt take it out on others, I tend to get a little reclusive although I do communicate it). 

Does anyone have any advice? I read so often about people with cPTSD having successful romantic relationships. Do I hide my issues until later (obviously not first date material)? Do I cut things off to ‚Äúspare‚Äù him? 

Does anyone have any advice on how to sit and cope with the panic and fear that comes at the thought of dating? Because I‚Äôll try to CBT my way out of it and say it‚Äôs incorrect but when I‚Äôm in a flashback, well‚Ä¶ I feel so ashamed and abnormal. I‚Äôve been working at building my self-worth, but when I get like this, it‚Äôs in the sewers. ",2,1737479948.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1i6nozd,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1i6nozd/i_am_so_lost/,I am so lost.,"My journey started suddenly, just a little over a month ago.

  
After several years without insurance, I finally reunited with my allergist who diagnosed me with MANY allergies back in 2018, and put me on several meds. Without insurance, I had only been able to take Allegra. I shared this had largely been successful, but wanted to know if I needed to go back on shots. She sent me home with some reading, and put in the prescription for one med I used to take many years ago - famotidine.

  
When she diagnosed me in 2018, I had reflux symptoms. For me, this was related to my horrible allergies because my stomach valve was always receiving drainage, therefore always open. So when I laid down at night, obviously, stuff was coming up. In all the years I didn't have insurance and ONLY had Allegra, I had long (years) stopped having any symptoms of reflux. My digestion is normal, my bowel movements are normal by every definition of the word, and I don't have any inexplicable aches or pains in relation to my digestive system. (I say this because if I'm irresponsible with taking allegra, I do sometimes get heart palpitations or hives, and am seeing a specialist soon about possible MCAS).

  
I truly just did not think about the purpose of the famotidine because I'd taken it before, and I trusted this doctor. I started taking the famotidine on December 18th. By December 20th, I had DEVELOPED \***SEVERE**\* acid reflux. I couldn't lie down, I constantly felt nauseous, and at times, it felt like I was a dragon exhaling fire. When I licked my lips, my lips burned. I've never experienced anything like it. I could barely eat.

  
By December 23rd, eating a single bite of any type of food made me instantly nauseous, and caused a sharp pain in my upper abdomen, right under my ribcage. By Christmas eve, I hadn't had a bowel movement in 3 days, I was doubled over in dull-to-sometimes sharp pain, so we went to the ER. At the ER, they did an ultrasound and a CT scan, looking at all my organs from my stomach to my bladder, with theories about my gallbladder specifically. They reported that everything looked ""unremarkable,"" that I had no stones, and no inflammation. There was so much of nothing to report, that the ER doc theorized that I'd torn an ab muscle, and the pain was causing the nausea. 

  
I went to my (now former) GP, and she told me I have gastritis, and that my gallbladder needed to be removed. Sent in a surgical consult referral, in addition to prescribing me a PPI. From that appointment, which was December 30th, I began eating a low acid diet - mostly yogurt and egg whites, which I tolerated well. I had stopped taking the famotidine for several days at this point of my own accord.  On January 6th, I saw a Gastro Doctor. She scheduled me for a Hida scan and sent me home with Sucralfate. To date, I've not  received actual testing for gastritis - the breath test for h. pylori, an upper GI scope, etc. 

  
I couldn't seem to get anyone to hear that I only began experiencing reflux and difficulty with bowel movements **AFTER** I began taking famotidine - an acid reducer. To me, this felt significant, but I just kept being prescribed more acid reducers! So I went home from that gastro appointment and googled every question I could think of, and here's what I've currently landed on: I did not have excess stomach acid prior to my appointment with my allergist. I had no symptoms of reflux or GI issues of ANY kind prior to taking famotidine. And when I began taking an acid reducer with normal acid levels, my stomach lining got ripped to shreds. Through this experience, I've learned that gastritis is typically caused by LOW stomach acid, not high. (Why all the reducers then...?!) And without an appropriate amount of acid, the stomach is unable to pass along what it needs to for the gallbladder to function properly. That, combined with my inability to eat more than a few hundred calories for the first two weeks, led to very few bowel movements (along with pain that seemed to travel throughout my torso).

To date, I haven't taken a single pill I've been prescribed. I'm simply not comfortable taking meds for a condition I haven't been properly diagnosed with. What I *have* done is eat low acid and mucus-producing/protecting foods, along with a few supplements to help rebuild the lining of my stomach. I've been doing this since that gastro appointment, with incredible success. No more pains (anywhere!), no stomach upset, daily, regular bowel movements that have completely returned to what they were before all this began. I've been cooking with my usual amount of olive oil, eating (white) cheeses and other forms of dairy, and drinking coffee, all without pain or incident

  
I am scheduled for a Hida scan on the 28th which I am dreading because we are still paying off medical bills for my husband.

  
My question is this: does this sound like a bad gallbladder to you?? Or a severely irritated system due to a med I didn't need?? Or something else I haven't considered? TIA.",1,1737479869.0,gallbladders,1,1.0,False

Shame too, since I heard it would involve Kasumi and Akechi a lot. Oh well, that's what New Game Plus is for.

But yeah, that was a lot of fun and I went in relatively blind as to the actual plot, characters, and gameplay. I love the variation in the palaces and how the person viewed the world around them. Futaba's and Sae's were well-placed in the story and good way of showing a distorted heart doesn't necessarily mean an evil one. I will say that I don't think any of the other boss designs quite compared to Kamoshida's, even Jaldabaoth's. That demon thing was disturbing and only got more so the more you looked at it.

One thing I definitely appreciated was that it actually felt easier to level up as the game went on. I grew up with other JRPG games like Chrono Trigger and Breath of Fire and recently had played through Dragon Quest 11 for the first time and while they're all fun they do tend to get to the point where it feels like a bit of a slog to make sure your characters are at a high enough level to be ready for whatever comes at them. In this game though between the combat system, Mementos, and Ryuji's ability that lets you just bash through any enemy you're significantly stronger than the process actually felt pretty speedy and enjoyable. There were plenty of times were I was just driving around Mementos collecting treasure and flowers while listening to Kitty Monk or TFS Gaming because it was just that relaxing an experience. It's one of the reason's I'm not too upset over the levels being reset in New Game Plus, since it doesn't feel like it'll be too hard to regain them again once things get rolling.

I tried to switch up my party every new palace, especially to include a new member since odds were their element would be the weakness of many enemies in that place, but by the end my go-to party was Joker, Ann, Morgana, and Mokoto, since they all had healing skills, their Nuke and Fire attacks hit like a truck, and each one had a Showtime I'd unlocked with one of the reserve party members.

And naturally I liked all the party members and most of the confidants I got to know. I don't think there was anyone I disliked and more just that some of the dialogue options for Joker could be pretty limited sometimes or lead to the same result regardless of what he says. It's not a failing of this game necessarily, I'm just probably too used to Fallout 4's and Mass Effect's dialogue options that let me shape the character more to my liking. I enjoy roleplaying in roleplaying games.

I did really like what I felt like the dynamic was between Joker and Akechi though. The best way I can put it is that they felt like this weird swap-AU fanfic version of Light and L from Death Note, and not in a bad way. Especially by the end with Akechi's breakdown on the cruise ship. That really felt like Light when he was finally caught. It did feel like a tragedy, where the two of them honestly could have been friends and both of them even kind of want that but the actions of Akechi makes that impossible.

As for romance, which I know isn't a big part of the game beyond a few scenes and bits of dialogue, I went the Makoto route, though I was back and forth between her and Kasumi for a while. Frankly I don't think there were any bad potential love interests among the girls around Joker's age, all of them work for one reason or another. Those were just the two through most of the game I felt were clicking the most with Joker, or at least how I was playing him...though late game made a hell of an argument for Haru, and I didn't even finish maxing her confidant levels (I kept beating palaces early and still didn't manage my time very well, as I clearly underestimated how easy it was to gain social skills without going out of my way to earn them). Again, I like to roleplay, so since I was having Joker taking care of the plant in his room to boost kindness and working at the plant store for that and to unlock a Mementos target I roleplayed that he discovered he enjoyed taking care of plants, so naturally when Haru comes around she and him have an immediate bond in gardening on the school roof, as well in talking about coffee. She's sweet, she has a very sympathetic story, and there's some of the stuff she says, especially in Mementos, that made me go ""Ooh, you're kinda weird."" which only made her even better.

But yeah, I'd already had Joker go with Makoto well before that and I don't regret it. They just felt like a good match and they had a lot of really sweet and touching moments between them, both before and after they got together. Plus I love imagining the reaction of the rest of the school to the delinquent who had all these terrible rumors going around about him, including that he smokes and once killed someone for looking at him wrong, suddenly dating the super serious and studious student council president who aims to run the police someday.

Also I really liked Lala. No reason to say that, I just felt like it needed saying. She's great.

And Ryuji REALLY needs to learn how to shut up about being a Phantom Thief when he's in public.

Looking forward to how things go in the game now that I have a better idea of what I'm doing and don't have to worry about leveling social skills.",8,1737479711.0,Persona5,4,0.9,False

	1	Rise in home brewers
	‚Ä¢	While home espresso has seemingly been around for much longer and the niche thing to do if you ‚Äúhave the money‚Äù for it, brewing has been not only a much cheaper and increasingly accessible option, but is also blowing up in popularity especially on social media.¬†
	2	More ‚Äúomakase‚Äù/a rise in community events from cafes
	‚Ä¢	Its like bringing the competition experience to the community, when you think about it, its the best of the best who compete at high levels in coffee and then only the best of the best judges who get to experience that, omakase approach can bring a more personalized and informative approach to people in the specialty coffee scene or just wanting to get into it.¬†
	3	Rise in popularity of varietals
	‚Ä¢	Caturra: has been having a moment in non-co-fermented manners, personally ive had some favorable ones of washed and honey processes.¬†
	‚Ä¢	Sudan Rume: rising iin popularity from my observations as well.
	‚Ä¢	Sidra: while generally underlooked because of its savory characteristics, modern processing has unlocked interesting expressions of the sidra variety.¬†
	4	Roasters
	‚Ä¢	Hydrangea: their sourcing is the big thing that attracts me to them personally, they source a very wide variety from washed to co-fermented lots.
	‚Ä¢	Thankfully:¬† what i like to call ‚Äúthe new sey‚Äù sourcing very similar and profiles are very tealike and intended to highlight sweetness
	‚Ä¢	September: Sourcing wizards and love how they offer a variety of options like hydrangea but also having a nice array of profiles, aimed towards highlighting specific attributes of the coffee not using a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù approach
	‚Ä¢	More roasters from origin: like mikava, native (deigo bermudez, now roasting in colombia too I believe) and savage. Doing this helps lower costs and increase acessibility for consumers.
	‚Ä¢	Promethium: A new roaster who ive never tried but is doing free samples soon for their launch? Of some well renowned lots. Nothing any roaster has done
	‚Ä¢	Exposure therapy: love their initiative and also have not tried anything yet but also taking a never-donebefore approach.¬†
	‚Ä¢	Gout and co: i cupped a couple of things last year and really enjoyed the expression of the coffees, not too light not too dark.¬†

* I tested my b12 and folate and the levels came back as 635pg/ml for b12 and 18.5 pg/ml for folate

The sound of your neighbor‚Äôs dog barking? Power. The heat from your oven while you ‚Äúovercook‚Äù that pizza? Power. The humidity from your shower? Yep, more power.

This isn‚Äôt some sci-fi movie plot; it‚Äôs the next frontier of energy innovation. The idea is simple (okay, maybe not *that* simple): Every little bit of energy waste around us‚Äîheat, sound, vibrations, humidity‚Äîcan be captured and turned into electricity. Your house could basically become its own tiny power station, intelligently collecting energy from every available source‚Äîsound, heat, humidity, ‚Äîwithout you even noticing.

  
**Why does this matter?**  
We‚Äôre entering a time when sustainable energy isn‚Äôt just about big solar farms or wind turbines. It‚Äôs about *every* part of our environment contributing to the grid. Imagine a city where buildings and homes no longer depend on traditional energy sources but are completely self-sustaining. You could have:

* **Lower energy costs**: No more high bills, just a home that powers itself.
* **Energy independence**: Particularly valuable for remote locations or disaster-prone areas.
* **Smarter homes**: Homes equipped to capture, store, and use energy from sound, heat, vibrations, and humidity‚Äîmaking them more efficient and green.

This isn‚Äôt some far-off dream; it‚Äôs a growing reality, with technologies like:

* **Piezoelectric generators**: These capture vibrations (even from footsteps!) and convert them into energy.
* **Thermoelectric systems**: Harnessing heat differences (from the oven, radiator, or even your morning coffee!) to generate power.
* **Humidity harvesters**: Harvesting moisture from the air to create electricity‚Äîa totally new frontier in energy innovation.

Now, let‚Äôs **explore** this together as a community. What if we took these concepts and applied them to make homes fully energy self-sufficient? What do we need to make it happen? And where do we see the future of energy harvesting heading in the next few years?

**Let‚Äôs brainstorm:**

* **What overlooked sources of energy do you think we could capture and use to power our homes?**
* **Could we really make homes completely energy-independent using this kind of technology?**
* **What are the biggest obstacles we need to overcome to make this a reality?**

This is an exciting time in energy innovation, and we‚Äôre here to discuss, share, and collaborate. Let‚Äôs keep this conversation going and push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible! Feel free to share your ideas, thoughts, or any energy harvesting concepts you‚Äôre exploring.

Asked out a girl and she agreed. She couldn't make the first time I suggested. But then gave me her basic schedule of when she's free (only days of the week no specific hours).

I'm trying to schedule another time that works for us both, but she takes a very long time to respond to messages. I'm not upset by that and I understand she's has a busy schedule. What I'm wondering is how do I go about this?

People have told me to do all the work to schedule the date, and not ask what times work for her. (And besides I already have her schedule). So do I just keep making educated guesses as to when she's free specifically. Or do I just ask if she'd like to get coffee on a day she's free sometime around lunch?

* DF64
* Breville bambino plus
* autolevel tamper & bottomless portafilter from normcore
* WDT
* Fresh beans, on the lighter side

I've been experimenting with using paper filter, mostly to lower the cafestol and keep an eye on my cholesterol.

I'm noticing that I'm getting more bitter AND sour shots when using a filter, even when my times are slower with the filter. For example, I'll use a grind of 11 with and without, and get a somewhat faster shot, 21 seconds for 53 grams with the filter (shooting for 3:1) and 19 seconds for 53g without, but it'll be more balanced, less bitter and less sour without the filter. When I loosen up the grind the sourness is even more noticeable, even though there's no channelling. I'm 90% sure my prep is good and consistent, especially that I've got the autolevel tamper now.

Is there something that can be done to improve this? Does anyone else use them? Thoughts? I'm starting to think I'll stop using them, since I'm not sure how much of an effect they have on cafestol either.",1,1737479198.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1i6ncof,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i6ncof/to_build_a_starship_part_15/,To Build a Starship  Part 15,"The reactions of the crew of the Sundancer to the immense processor ship now following them like an enthusiastic puppy ran the range from fear initially, then through curiosity, and finally acceptance.   Sundancer had spent several hours in intense communication with the Celestron first attempting to get it to shut down, then later trying to determine its psychological state.

The crew had gathered in the common area, looking at the image of the processor ship, now changed as it was back lit by a massive drive plume as it worked to keep up with the Sundancer.

""Is the AI stable?"" the captain had asked.

Sundancer had spent a considerable amount of time on this, for her, but still her answer was not as confident as they would have liked.

""The Celestron s not dangerously unbalanced, however, given what we know about it, it seems that whomever had programmed it used some interesting algorithms,  I believe that as the human population was growing desperate for more interstellar capable ships, they gave him a large degree of latitude in choosing actions.  He's not just limited to a set course, but was empowered by his creators to actively seek out creative solutions.   He's actually programmed to think outside of the box.""  this last part amused Sunny slightly, as by definition, an AI lived inside a metal box.  The humor was lost on her human companions however.

""That explains why it decided to come way out here to begin with"" Mike opined, ""creative problem solving for the lack of resources in system. ""  He thought for a few moments, ""Well, now that its following us, I suppose we could risk a trip over there and check it out.   It's not like we're going to be leaving it behind."" This last part was directed towards the captain, as he would make the ultimate decision on whether they could accept the risks invovled.  He thought for a few moments.

""I think we can risk a minimal visit, two people, provided Sunny vouches for our newfound traveling companion."" the captain said.

""I am confident the Celestron will stay with us, at least until we reach the Azure Flame."" Sunny replied.  They were following the track they had received from the Celestron, and had detected what they believed was the Azure Flame several million kilometers distant.   As it was just a cold lump of metal at this point, it was hard to be sure, but based on analysis of it's shape, location, and other factors their confidence was high.

""Mike, you and Peter will go over to the Celestron.  Mike can satisfy his curiosity and sense of history, and Peter will go along to provide safety over watch, just incase the Celestron isn't in as good a shape as it appears.""

Joe was about to protest, when Captain Oliver held up a hand,

""It's my decision on who goes, based on who can make it, deal with what ever might happen, and get back in one piece.""  He looked at Joe, who swallowed any objections, the captain was after all, the ultimate authority onboard the ship, and a lifetime in space had taught him that leadership and responsibility were things one did not trifle with.  His face however betrayed his disappointment and frustration.

""I will take one of the work suits"" Peter said, ""It will give us the opportunity to run a full operational checkout, and if anything goes wrong, I'll have all the tools I need to deal with it, at least to get back out and returning to the Sundancer.""

Captain Oliver nodded, that was what he would have suggested had Peter not beat him to it.  Peter and Ama stuck their heads together, and began discussing what they needed to do.

""I will advice the Celestron to expect visitors"" Sunny said, something the others had overlooked.  The massive ships AI may have been OK with surprise visits, or it may not have.  It was easy to forget something so large had the capacity for thought.

A little over an hour later,  Mike, dressed in a vacuum suit, and Peter, encased in the work suit, stood in one of the cargo airlocks.  Ready to make the short trip over to the Celestron.  Ama, in the other work suit, was also in the airlock, where she would remain as a backup, until the two erstwhile explorers returned safely.

The air was pumped from the lock, and the large cargo door opened into the blackness of space.  The lights from the suits and airlock illuminated the surrounding area, the sharp demarcation of shadow and light in the vacuum of space creating the illusion of pieces of ship where the lights fell, and inky emptiness everywhere else.  Peter extended one of the manipulators to Mike, the jaws open.  The massive manipulator could tear centimeter thick steel plate, or fold an origami crane, limited only by the skill of the operator, or any preprogramed commands.  Mike maneuvered between the claws, turned to face away from the work suit, with one arm on each claw like an overstuffed chair, his legs drawn up in a comfortable semi seated position that would keep his center of gravity close enough to where the large manipulator touched his back that he wouldn't have to strain during their flight over to the massive ship following them.  Peter deftly touched the controls of the work suit, short sharp puffs from it's thrusters lifted it like a feather off the floor, and then smoothly out of the massive lock.

""You're Clear"" Ama told Peter.  He acknowledged with a simple ""OK"".  Then rotated the work suit to face towards the stern of the Sundancer.  He could only see a portion of the massive bulk of the spherical processor ship, but even that was impressive, when you were out here with it.

The rest of the crew  watched the video feed seated around the common room.  Joe and Lan had sat together, Joe wedged into a corner of one of the sofa like seats, and Lan had sat leaning against him, with his arm around her. They were unconsciously mimicking how Peter and Ama routinely sat together. The captain had taken a seat adjacent to theirs.  All three were watching the display, as the feed showed the Celestron getting larger, and larger. Until it appeared that the camera was hovering over a great metal plain, studded with fittings and laced with seams.

""How you doing out there Mike?"" Peter asked,

""All Ok,"" he replied, ""It's one hell of a view"".

""Sure is"" Peter agreed, then ""We're three meters off of the Celestron, orbiting around to the access portal.  It looks like that's a few hundred meters off.""  for the benefit of those aboard Sundancer.

""Understood"" Ama replied.  She was the only other person who'd be communicating with the explorers, in order to keep things as simple as possible.

In the common room the image on the display rotated dizzyingly, then began to slide downwards as Peter flew the work suit along the surface, to the entrance point. Whether out of design necessity or a fit of symmetry, the human access port had been placed exactly opposite the drive cone, which meant it was always facing the direction of travel, and therefor relatively close to where the two men came to the surface of the great ship.   The hatch came into view, and Peter stopped just above it, hovering for a moment.  He found several fittings next to the hatch that must have been used to attach some sort of docking tunnel when the ship was being built.  He secured the work suit to one of these using a secondary manipulator and locked it down.  Mike pushed off and landed next to the hatch, he looked about and found the pad that would open it, and pressed it.  The hatch split along its central seam, and slid open, revealing a well lit airlock.  It was big enough for the work suit to fit, having been designed to enable technical crews access to the ships interior during all phases of its construction.

They entered the airlock, Mike pushed the pad that closed the door and started the atmosphere cycling back into the lock.  As he locked around, he noticed a bronze plaque on the wall, The ships name, build date and a list of names of designers and engineers was engraved there.  He pulled his data pad from his wrist bracket, and photographed it.  When the internal door opened, he switched to video mode and began capturing details of the great ships interior.   The interior door of the airlock opened into a large room, with several hatches located along the walls.  Monitors, Data ports, and Alcoves for pressure suits were arrayed around the room.   They walked forward, towards a door that lead to the main control room, that would have been used when the builders brought the great ship to life, and ran their system tests and checks.  Mike opened that hatch, and entered the smaller control room.  Three seats in a small semicircle, surrounded by monitors, which were powered on, displaying various system status, and a few had notes from the final systems check outs.  Mikes excitement at this historical treasure trove was obvious. as he moved around to each new area with enthusiastic comments, capturing photos and videos.

Finding an interface that allowed direct interaction with the AI that controlled the ship, Mike powered it up, and proceeded to talk to the Celestron directly.  His excitement waned as the ship seemed less enthusiastic about answering his questions than he'd hoped.  Indeed for it's part the Celestron considered the verbal communications a time consuming and tedious form of data transmission.  It had already sent all the data contained in it's memory, and received what data it had requested from Sundancer in their previous exchanges.   Mike attributed the ships attitude to being designed to function fully autonomously and alone for it's entire life.  It didn't need much of a personality, and it's creators hadn't given it one. Just enough to accomplish their needs.  The real effort was spent in the the processing and decision making modules.

Peter for his part was less impressed.  He looked around at mostly obsolete technology, working the salvage value, which he would never be able to cash in.  He was also thinking of how this ship could be converted into habitable space, with the massive amounts of power and room available, it could be luxurious accommodations for thousands of people.  He stopped asking Mike about that, after Mike told him conversion would cost as more than building from scratch, as the ship wasn't built to be air tight even.  According to Mike, it's main value was historical, and scrap value.   Though the functional generators and drive would be highly valued, given their huge capacity.

The captains voice soon ended the explorers reveries, it was time to return to the Sundancer.  Mike took one last look around, and spotted an acrylic clipboard, it still had the flimsy sheets and stylus attached.  As if the engineer had just set it down to go get a coffee and would be right back to resume work.  After a thought, he took the clipboard and tucked it under his arm.  Being designed for use in space it would easily survive the trip back to the Sundancer, and it would be a fine little souvenir of his visit to the great trip.   As they left the Celestron, it closed the doors, powered down the now unoccupied compartments, and depressurized them.

The return to the Sundancer went as smoothly as the trip out.   Soon enough the crew went back to their work of prepping for the arrival at the Azure Flame.",7,1737479022.0,HFY,2,0.89,False

I notice a clue or a couple of things line up, so I start doing some digging to make sure I have my facts straight so I can share them.

Then I start searching and reading, and without fail, those breadcrumbs have now led me down a path. Deep into the woods. And by the time I come out the other side, I have pages of notes written up for a post. This weekend I decided to go HAM once I started working on new leads. That‚Äôs where we find ourselves today.

**The thing you have to realize before you read on, is that in Tailor Made Freestyle, when Drake said ‚Äú*****You better have a motherfuckin' quintuple entendre on that shit. Some shit I don't even understand, like ¬∑ That shit better be crazy‚Ä¶‚Äù*** **much like the Michael Jordan meme, Kendrick took that shit personally.**

What I realized in the course of my latest deep dive is literally everything is a quintuple entendre. Like truly almost every single word or phrase he‚Äôs emphasized in what I‚Äôll call the ‚Äúbeef tracks‚Äù has multiple layers. There just happens to be a few of those tracks on GNX too. That‚Äôs why there are a number of different theories about specific clues. How can \_\_\_ clue point to 3 different things? How can the chandelier point to ‚Äúpascha‚Äù the religious term, Pascha the brothel and gambling scams involving baccarat? Bc that‚Äôs literally how Kendrick wrote it.

For the purposes of this post let‚Äôs say those tracks include Like That, euphoria, 6:16 in LA, Meet the Grahams, Not Like Us, Watch The Party Die, wacced out murals, squabble up, man at the garden, hey now, tv off, peekaboo, gnx. (There‚Äôs also a few jabs in some of the other songs during this time period but I think these are the more ‚Äúdirect flights‚Äù) I‚Äôd also include n95, The Hillbillies, Kings Dead as far as clues go but those predate the quintuple entendre taunt so they aren‚Äôt as layered.

Something else to keep in mind is that we have moved way past just Drake on some of this stuff. Kendrick meant what he said when he said ‚Äúfuck the industry too‚Äù so a lot of these things point us towards larger systems of exploitation and trafficking that are connected to the things Drake is involved in. But Drake isn‚Äôt a Bond villain. He‚Äôs not personally piloting the cargo ships filled with‚Ä¶ whatever. But he and the people he associates with are facilitating these kinds of activities. And Drake gets to benefit by partaking in the things he personally enjoys taking advantage of like gambling, exploiting up and coming rappers, general debauchery/ sexual deviancy and grooming younger girls but outside of those activities, the other crimes might be more removed from his knowledge. He‚Äôs signing the checks and giving nods of approval, but he‚Äôs not planning this all out. That‚Äôs not to absolve him of guilt but I don‚Äôt want us to talk about Drake like he‚Äôs Thanos or something. He‚Äôs not smart enough or disciplined enough. But he‚Äôs definitely moving in a flock of criminals. From Kendrick‚Äôs perspective, if the listener conflates these two things and just blames it all on Drake, all the better.

Now that we have that out of the way, let‚Äôs talk about the 5 states I explored and what‚Äôs going on that the lyrics point us to. It‚Äôs crazy y‚Äôall. Man‚Äôs an actual mad scientist.

The first time I saw this pin I didn‚Äôt think ‚ÄúWizard of Oz‚Äù I thought ‚ÄúEmerald City‚Äù but I‚Äôll come back to that. It makes sense for this group to use this kind of imagery bc The Wizard of Oz is set in Kansas (at least the real world part of the story), plus there‚Äôs another Kansas pin on the belt buckle - the one with the sunflower. So let‚Äôs look at Kansas, as well as sunflower imagery, and boy oh boy is there lots to look at:

As mentioned, Kansas has adopted The Wizard of Oz as somewhat of a state symbol since the movie is largely set in Kansas, this is why CCMFOA uses that on their pin. Let's focus on the yellow brick road relevant connections: regardless of location first

I think the Kansas related clues are more about Wizard of Oz and Sunflower symbolism than the state itself. But like I said, when I saw the Wizard of Oz pin, I thought *Emerald City* first. **Seattle is the Emerald City**. We haven‚Äôt really talked about Seattle (at least I haven‚Äôt seen it if we did) so I just tucked that away.

**Washington**

This past week I‚Äôve spent quite a bit of time in [ImportYeti l](https://www.importyeti.com/)ooking at [OVO Merchandising](https://www.importyeti.com/company/october-s-very-own-merchandising) shipments. The most shipped to place on the west coast is Washington - second in the US only behind NJ/NYC.

Ok, time to see what‚Äôs going on in the PNW, specifically Seatlle and Tacoma area. (Bear in mind this is also very close to the Canadian border)

I guess it started here with the **982** showing on the belt buckle. Once I figured out the level Kendrick had taken this all to, I realized that LITERALLY everything means something.

* 982 isn't an area code like I thought at first, its the first 3 digits of a zip code in Washington, specifically the Seattle area. It's not Seattle proper, but the surrounding area.
* What else is in a 982xxx zip code and incredibly close to the Canadian border? **Rosecrans** Street

* If we travel by boat, not far from the shore near Rosecrans street, we find **MINOR ISLAND,** an island so minor that you can't really find it on the map unless you zoom in far enough. It's next to ""Smith Island"" if you need help locating it.

**Utah**

We've already started talking about Utah a bit, specifically around Crumbl cookies. We were tipped off to that because of some weirdo Drake posts about it. I didn't necessarily expect to find much here, but oh wow, I sure did. 

* Let's start with Crumbl:

I planned to stop there, but couldn't get the lyric about ""blue strips"" out of my head. Yes, of course, blue strips like what's in money to combat counterfeiting, but maybe ""blues trips"" means something.¬†I‚Äôve had it stuck in my head for months now that Dennis Graham/ Memphis probably factors way more prominently in whatever nefarious activities are going on, so a quick look was warranted.

**Tennessee**

Nashville & Memphis need a deeper dive, but at this point I just wanted to finish this post, so here are some points to get started with:

* **Sweet** City USA in Nashville - *the city just made it sweet* [*https://www.sweetcityusa.com/*](https://www.sweetcityusa.com/)
* **Sweet** City Woman - a song by Canadian rock band The **Stampeders.** 
   * Recorded in Toronto [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet\_City\_Woman?wprov=sfti1#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_City_Woman?wprov=sfti1) \- 
   * Band is called The **Stampeders** \- remember how Drake opened for Travis Scott when the crowd crush thing happened in Houston? Houston is another city that needs a very deep dive.
   * Stampede also points towards cattle/bovine
* I found this in my Washington research but I'll put it here... **Blue Stripe K9 - I realize it says Stripe and not Strip but no way was I looking past dog training** with a guy in Santa suit who moved from Seattle to Nashville. The photo is CRAZY and suspicious AF.

* The Memphis Grizzlies were the Toronto Grizzlies until 2000. I don‚Äôt think the team moving cities has anything to do with Drake or his family but just it‚Äôs an interesting point to bring up.
* Memphis is the number 2 cargo hub IN THE WHOLE WORLD. It‚Äôs a huge smuggling/ trafficking hub. (And there‚Äôs long standing rumors about underground tunnels and caves in the area that are used in smuggling)
* Memphis natives, MJG & 8 Ball worked with Baka Not Nice.
* I found an interesting factoid in this article about there being some point of contention about a J Prince having or not having a run in with 8 Ball. (Reported by Gillie btw) [8Ball & MJG Honored with Their Own Intersection in Memphis | Stop The Breaks](https://www.stopthebreaks.com/hip-hop-news/8ball-mjg-honored-with-their-own-intersection-in-memphis/)
* Drake cancelled his most recent Memphis concert after postponing it several times. He cited production issues with the venue. Totally plausible but it seems a little bit weird in the context of everything else. He also cancelled SLC - another city of interest.
* The Memphis **pyramid.** Where the Grizzlies used to play. (Now a Bass Pro Shop lol) Modeled after the great pyramids of Egypt. Even the cities name, Memphis, is after the Egyptian city. Just made me think of the ‚Äú*might have built the pyramids*‚Äù line from wacced out murals. I‚Äôm not even going to go into the weirdo occult shit associated with that.
* This statement from Project Pat about Dennis Graham being protected in Memphis. [The Source |\[WATCH\] Project Pat Explains Why Drake's Dad Won't Get Touched In Memphis](https://thesource.com/2021/09/28/watch-project-pat-explains-why-drakes-dad-wont-get-touched-in-memphis/)
* Memphis rapper, Young Dolph murdered. Can‚Äôt find Dolph/Drake beef but found this article where Dennis talks about Drake hanging with Yo Gotti when he was younger. And Yo Gotti and Dolph did have problems. (Yo Gotti is/was signed to ROC Nation) [https://www.stopthebreaks.com/hip-hop-news/8ball-mjg-honored-with-their-own-intersection-in-memphis/](https://www.stopthebreaks.com/hip-hop-news/8ball-mjg-honored-with-their-own-intersection-in-memphis/)

* And back to my original hunch, **Blues Trips**. [https://www.pbs.org/theblues/roadtrip.html](https://www.pbs.org/theblues/roadtrip.html) That's an interesting path if ever I've seen one and now we need to look at a few more cities.

They tried 2 times to charge me for services for which I specifically had elected not to pay for (Unlimited coffee and Premium WiFi). They cancel the charges the first time, but tried again the following month and upon cancelling my subscription with them.

 I rented a space in dallas at the Quorum office spaces they have there in Addison, TX. From the beginning, I told them I would be there for just 2-3 months while we got a permanent space. It was never mentioned that I would have to pay a restoration fee, so we agreed on the monthly price and signed the agreement on line.

I announced we would vacate the space, they charge me 9 days before I have to leave the office a $730.00 restoration fee, full $200 dollars more that the monthly rent. I tried to fight this over and their only answer is, those are the rules you agreed upon.

  
Maybe, I by mistake somewhere in the paperwork accepted this when I received it on day one of being there, where all the rules and regulations were described, but never saw did it mention this. My point is if I had known this, specially how much it would have been at the time we were negotiating the rent, I would probably not have signed the contract. It is a deceiptful trap so they can earn an extra month of rent, maybe more.

Idk where to start pero I felt like I needed to do this.  
  
I had the chance to be enlightened by a friend of yours at work who happened to be a ""talking stage"" of mine before we happened. She told me about everything that you did and didn't do, you seemed a bit popular sa company nyo happy na sana ako kaso lang it was for the wrong things eh

I know you cheated on me and said that you had to let me go because of ""family"" which didn't happen kasi you're now with someone new idk I guess I expected it din but siguro katangahan na lang din kasi I would still accept you kahit na I know you would destroy me again emotionally and financially. Maybe ganun na nga lang talaga kasi di naman ako perfect and I have my lapses and for those I'm deeply sorry.

But anyways, since that day we went our separate ways I saw you twice in the same place dun sa gas station malapit sa work mo and para bang gusto kitang lapitan and yakapin kasi you looked like home kaso at the same time you seem like a stranger to me, like someone I used to know.

Kinda sad how we got here and I apologize for what my mom did to you and your son. To this day I still think that was the reason why you chose to let go. I'm sorry I was powerless, but believe me I tried.

My friends hated you because of everything that you did to me and how keeping you was costing me a lot financially but I still chose you because they don't know you like I do - we were like Romeo and Juliet or Bonnie and Clyde. I fought for us even though it seemed like a losing battle already.

I hate how we never would talk about the way we feel even if we're alone together. How you'd only chat me when you needed something.

Though I miss going to you, when every after shift I'd travel to where you are without sleep and I would instantly feel energized like a cup of coffee in the morning. And I'd never forget about your son who would run to me and he'd call me ""papa"" even if I know he's not mine I treated him like my own.

But like all good stories ours had to end even if it's not the way we wanted it to be. I now call you my ""Good Dream"" and here I thought I would be the reason for you to change haha but yea I met a couple of girls but idk I just kinda feel empty and would rather just work my ass off and pay my bills pero yun siguro I've never really moved on since then.

You're the best and worst of my 2024 even our story only lasted for 7 months na taliwas naman sa sinasabi mo sa iba na 2 year naging tayo which bizarre for me. Still from the bottom of my heart I say Thank You.

Sana kayo na ang magtagal and this time seryosohin mo na sya, I'm happy for you.

FYI I'm on Linux mint 21.3 with tasty cinnamon, everything up to date and working well.  

Gnome apps work, they're just shitty to use.  A proper title bar would do them wonders in my heavy multitasking multi-display environment.  I can't hit the alt key with my left hand if I'm working my stream deck or drinking coffee (or batin' lol), and moving GTK douche-bag app windows is very fiddly and unpleasant.

Believe it or not I am not trying to be political, bear with me.

  
I tried to be supportive and explain that we have an emergency reserve, we have a pantry, we are going to be okay. After several hours, I don‚Äôt remember what happened. But there was some kind of disruption and I just excused myself to go to the bathroom and just scrolled on my phone, trying to avoid this mess. When I went down stairs I realized it was 12pm. I made lunch and set his plate on the coffee table and told him I needed to recharge, I was exhausted and wanted alone-time during lunch. ¬†I suggested we chat about our goals for the today at 12:15. 12:15pm comes. He is giving me the silent treatment. I said, ‚Äòfine, let‚Äôs chat at 12:30‚Äô. 12:30 comes, and again he is giving me the silent treatment.

  
By this point it was 1pm. I tell him I am getting ready for the gym and will leave in 10 minutes. At this point he seemed to snap at me. He is screaming at me, telling me I have no empathy. Telling me I don‚Äôt care. Telling me how I am making him out to be a crazy person.¬†I was trying to encourage him to get help, telling him he needed to get control over his emotions. Asking him if he has tried journalling.

  
I did set a boundary with him.¬†I said you know what, I am going to the gym. I am leaving in 5 minutes. It is a beautiful day. The sun is out. It snowed, I have monday off. I am choosing to enjoy my day off. I am choosing to be happy. If you want to be unhappy. If you want to be miserable. If you want to spend the day like this, it is your choice. I am going o the gym. You are welcome to join me. He was so pissed.¬†

  
After the gym, I got home and it was 2:45pm or so by that point. He is upstairs. He and I start talking. Well, arguing. And at some point he starts yelling at me, like full one screaming. And I said, ‚Äúnope. I am setting a boundary. I am taking a shower. We can talk later‚Äù. And he loses it again. He is punching the door repeatedly. Screaming at me about how I am locking him out of the conversation...

Eventually he goes downstairs. Finally, when I go downstairs he is calm but he starts arguing with me and about apathetic I am and how I woe him an apology. I did apologize and it seemed to help but he was still wanting to argue. Eventually he took a call from his parents. I asked them to call him. And he calmed down and went upstairs to be alone. 

And then he spent the next few hours crying and alone. When I checked on him (by this point it was 5pm or so) he was crying and apologizing and stating how he never deserved me. I did comfort him and suggested we watch TV to relax. After that, he did calm down and his mood was restored.

  
My husband does this every few months. Do you think it is abusive? Does this happen to anyone? Anyone out there? When things get maximally stressful, do you or your spouse behave like this? We did a lot of work in marriage counseling, things have gotten better. But when he hit the bathroom door I felt unsafe. I was considering calling the police but I am afraid he will get angrier or that I will live with a very angry, resentful person for many days. It would be uncomfortable and would make me feel intimidated. To his credit, he has never hit me. Also, for context, he used to do this monthly, and now it is down to every few months...",1,1737478333.0,Marriage,7,0.67,False
1i6n2mw,https://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/main-tasks/supervision/supervised-institutions,üåäüèñÔ∏è Banking & Currency in Crete Greece üèñÔ∏èüåä,"Planning a trip to Crete or Greece? Knowing about¬†money and banking¬†here is key. 
Greece uses the¬†Euro (‚Ç¨), just like many European countries. Bring your Visa or Mastercard‚Äîthey‚Äôre widely accepted. 
If you carry over¬†‚Ç¨10,000 in cash, you MUST inform customs. For smaller amounts, no worries!
Greek Banking System Structure
The banking sector is dominated by four major institutions: National Bank of Greece, Piraeus Bank, Alpha Bank, and Eurobank. These banks follow regulations set by the Bank of Greece, ensuring secure transactions for tourists and locals alike.
Banks in Crete¬†open from 8 AM to 2:30 PM, Monday to Friday. Some in busy areas open weekends.¬†ATMs¬†(cash machines) are everywhere‚Äînear shops, beaches, and malls. Use cards with a¬†4-digit PIN. Ask your bank about fees before traveling.
Currency &#038; Costs in Crete &#8211; Greece
Here‚Äôs what you might spend daily: A hotel breakfast:¬†‚Ç¨10‚Äì‚Ç¨15. Lunch at a caf√©:¬†‚Ç¨6‚Äì‚Ç¨10. Dinner:¬†‚Ç¨15‚Äì‚Ç¨20¬†per dish. A gyros wrap:¬†‚Ç¨4‚Äì‚Ç¨5. Bottled water:¬†‚Ç¨0.50. Love coffee? A cappuccino costs¬†‚Ç¨3‚Äì‚Ç¨4.
Euro coins come in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 cents, and ‚Ç¨1 or ‚Ç¨2. Notes start at ‚Ç¨5 and go up to ‚Ç¨500, but big bills like ‚Ç¨200 are rare. Keep smaller notes handy for markets or cafes.
Currency Exchange Tips
Need to swap your dollars or pounds? Visit¬†banks, airports, or exchange kiosks¬†in cities like Heraklion. Rates vary, so check online tools before exchanging. For local help, visit¬†Cretorama, your go-to guide for Crete tips.
For the best exchange rates:

Use bank services (most favorable rates)
Avoid hotel/street exchanges
Keep all transaction receipts
Compare rates before exchanging
Watch for hidden fees

DO NOT AGREE OR SIGN ANYTHING BEFORE YOU SEE THE RECEIPT
Tipping &#038; Taxes
Tipping isn‚Äôt required, but rounding up or leaving¬†5‚Äì10%¬†for great service is kind. Bills include a¬†24% tax¬†(VAT) on most items. Books and basics have lower taxes. Tourists can‚Äôt claim VAT refunds on meals or hotels.
Prices might be¬†rounded up/down¬†to the nearest 5 cents. For example, ‚Ç¨5.12 becomes ‚Ç¨5.10, and ‚Ç¨5.18 becomes ‚Ç¨5.20. This ‚ÄúSwedish rounding‚Äù helps avoid small coins.
Digital Banking and Modern Payments
Most places take¬†chip-enabled cards¬†(no magnetic strip needed). Contactless payments work too! 
Traveler‚Äôs checks¬†in USD, GBP, or AUD can be swapped for euros at hotels or banks. But cards are easier‚Äîsave checks for emergencies.
Most establishments accept:

Chip-enabled cards
Contactless payments (Smart Watches, RFIC Phones)
Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
International payment systems

The regional authority regularly updates regulations regarding digital payments and tourist services.
Banking Safety Tips and Regulations

Notify your bank before travel
Keep emergency contact numbers
Use bank ATMs when possible
Monitor transactions regularly
Store receipts safely

Greece Crete Quick Money Tips 

Always carry some cash for small purchases
Keep emergency numbers handy
Store valuable documents separately
Use bank ATMs instead of independent ones
Keep small denominations for daily expenses

For safety, notify your bank about travel dates. Lost cards? Contact your provider immediately.

In the tide of thousands of sellers, your visuals are the first‚Äîbut probably not the last‚Äîfirst impression that a buyer gets from your product. They display your product and tell your story as a brand, address pain points for your customers, and encourage those shoppers to click ‚ÄúAdd to Cart.‚Äù¬†

From a simple lifestyle shot that offers inspiration, to a clean infographic that educates your audience on how your products or services can help them, your¬†**listing images**¬†need to directly address the needs of your audience.

# The Unique Impact of Images on Amazon Conversion Rates

Your product images are more than pictures‚Äîthey are your silent salesmen ready to speak directly to your customers when you are selling on Amazon.¬†**Listing images**¬†can help you achieve all your conversion goals, build customer trust, and make your brand stand out from the competition on Amazon.¬†

Below are eight creative and actionable ways images can affect Amazon¬†[conversion rates](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-does-amazon-product-photography-affect-conversion-rates/), along with new tips and examples for sellers.

# Scroll-Stopping First Impressions

Your number one image is the first and possibly the only opportunity for your product to capture attention on Amazon and most other e-commerce sites. A good, bright, and cleaner shot can set you apart from others in the listing.¬†

To this end, identify a main image that stands out from other listings, follows the Amazon guidelines, and showcases what makes the product special.

* For instance, if a seller is selling a stainless steel water bottle, the¬†[main image](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/why-the-right-main-image-can-be-a-game-changer-for-your-product/)¬†may contain the water bottle, but will also contain colors and reflections to demonstrate its high quality. When the product catches the viewer‚Äôs eye on a pure white background with full clarity, it can be identified from a distance, which makes you stop scrolling.

Weighty Tip for Sellers: Experiment with angles for your primary image to see which engages the most viewership. Choose an A/B testing tool (like Splitly) and test it out to see what does better

# Detailed Product Images Starts Building Trust

As shoppers don‚Äôt get to see and touch their products, clear and high-quality images are necessary to create trust. Show multiple¬†**listing images**¬†with all sides, details, and close-ups of textures and materials. This insight reduces friction and gives buyers confidence that they know what they‚Äôre getting.

* For instance, if you sell leather wallets, show images of stitching quality, even leather quality (with some close-ups), internal compartment- images, etc. Detail of the embossed logo or brand can also point out the quality or authenticity.

A Fresh Concept for Sellers: Macro photography for extreme close-ups of luxurious materials or fine details. Emphasize the uniqueness of your product, such as special design, craftsmanship, or endurance.

# An Emotional Bond Connecting Lifestyle Pictures

Lifestyle shots enable customers to envisage how your product integrates into their lives. You can create an emotional response in your audience by showing users using your product in real life situations. You enkindle desirability.

* If you are selling a yoga mat, show someone doing yoga at a beautiful outdoor area that evokes relaxation and health. Show features such as grip or thickness in action so that the customer can easily visualize how they will experience it too.

Ideas for Sellers: Partner with micro influencers or photographers for lifestyle shots with varying demographics and environments. Just make sure those images resonate with the dreams of your audience.

# Provide Informative Infographics To Answer Questions

Infographics are a very effective visual method of communicating important information. Employ these to truly showcase scale, functionality, or any additional aspects that aren‚Äôt as clear in standard images.

* For instance, the seller of noise-cancelling headphones can insert an infographic with specifications for battery life, noise cancellation, and device compatibility. Buyers also find it easier to digest technical information when it is paired with clear visuals.

Have another idea for product comparison ‚Äî Infographics ‚Äî Without mentioning any competitor‚Äôs name. Employ appealing icons, graphs, and bulleted lists.

# Sequential Images Storytelling

Step by step illustration or cartoon-style photo also helps buyers take a travel plan, visually illustrating the process of using guides or the process of change. It works particularly well on products that are targeted to solve a particular problem or need to be assembled.

* Illustrate the actual process if you are selling a kitchen gadget (say, a vegetable spiralizer) ‚Äî step-by-step images of how to set it up, how to spiralize some vegetables, and how the final plate looks like, for example. Visual storytelling that shows how to use a product and/or final results.

Fresh Concept for Sellers‚Äî Complementing sequential pictures with lifestyle graphics showing the way the product fits into daily routines to improve familiarity and utility.

# Standing Out With Unique Angle Shots

While many sellers are content with standard front-facing images there are plenty of angles that differentiates you from the products of other sellers. Show details that make your product unique, show perspectives that competitors might miss.

For instance, a seller of ergonomic office chairs should take under-seat angles where the adjustment levers are, or close-ups of the lumbar support system. These angles focus on functional fashion and comfort.

Tip for Sellers: Try incorporating 360-degree shots (or videos, where shoppers can ‚Äúmove around‚Äù the product) into your mix. Such an experience can increase conversions immensely.

# Fostering Confidence With Authentic Use

Using real photos of people who use your product establishes credibility and boosts buyer confidence in your brand. Commonplace scenarios rather than overzealous models

* For kitchen knives, you might feature a chef or a home cook preparing a meal in situ. Steer clear of pictures that look forced; your camera can smell the shine from across the room.

Sellers‚Äô fresh approach: Add customer-generated material that has got your authorization showing what they went through! These¬†**listing images**¬†serve as both social proof, and help make your listings come off as more authentic.

# Highlighting Value Through Before-and-After Comparisons

Use before-and-afters to showcase your product. They are the first to communicate the value of your product.

* E.g. A cleaning products seller may show a dirty surface prior to use and show the area nice n shiny post cleaning. This becomes a visual story of change

Make sure that these¬†**listing images**¬†are accurate and according to Amazon guidelines to not mislead the purchasers.

# Can Your Images Answer Buyer Questions?

[Amazon images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-turn-shoppers-into-buyers-with-killer-amazon-images/)¬†can do much more than showcase your product‚Äîthey can address buyer concerns, clarify features, and answer questions before they‚Äôre even asked.¬†

By using strategic visuals, you can reduce uncertainty, build trust, and boost conversions. Here‚Äôs how you can create images that act as a silent customer service tool.

# Showcase Dimensions Clearly

The biggest question buyers ask most of the time is the size of a product, when buying online. Although text descriptions include detail,¬†**listing images**¬†can bring dimensions to life in a way that is closer and easier to comprehend.

¬†Buyers never know how big or small a product actually is in real life, and they get confused about sizes a lot. Comparative images are a great solution to this problem.

* As an example, if you are selling a storage container, you might place it next to household items like a coffee mug, soda can, and/or a ruler. Which provides a context to help potential buyers quickly see how small or large the product actually is.¬†
* For instance, the dimensions of the container in the image should be displayed (length, width, and height) to avoid misleading customers.

# Highlight Key Features

Although bullet points and product descriptions are necessary for letting customers know about specific features of a product,¬†**listing images**¬†is a much quicker way to get these features across. Without any visual context, buyers would struggle to define expectations out of a wishlist.¬†

On the other hand, images that draw attention to these features make your listing more visually appealing and easier to understand, so your customers will find the most important information about your product right away.

Instead of providing a list of features in text, think about having images that highlight each feature on its own: e.g. if you are selling a backpack, show an image that highlights the anti-theft pocket, another image for a water bottle holder, etc.¬†

* For example, you can make a close up image to focus on the waterproof zippers or have a picture of padded straps while in use which provides comfort and durability, The same can be represented in the bag shot, like an image showing the various compartments with text call-outs pointing to the compartment available in the bag can explain the organizational structure of the bag perfectly.¬†

This lets customers see the value of the product right away, without having to wade through product specs.

# Demonstrate Usage Scenarios

A large portion of the ecom experience relies on the assumption of how a product will fit into a shopper‚Äôs daily life. This leads to a common doubt in the buyers about how the product will perform in the real world and if it all solves their need.¬†

[Lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/)¬†are the best way to alleviate those concerns and display how your product works perfectly in different situations. This will help buyers to visualize how the item can be used, making it more attractive.

* So if you have a foldable water bottle, include how to fold it for a small bag, how to take it out on a hike, and how to wash or rinse it under a tap. Such¬†**listing images**¬†contribute to buyers picturing the usability and practicality of the product.

¬†Do not just do the dreaded white-background in the middle of the screen shot of the water half-filled with unbranded water, but show it in action (it is where the convenience, portability, and functionality lives).

Lifestyle images lead buyers to visualize the product in action, and they are giving you an opportunity to help them feel an emotional connection with the item by imagining how well it could work for them, and what benefits they can derive from it.

¬†These images more or less respond to questions such as: ‚ÄúWill it fit in my bag?‚Äù OR ‚Äî ‚ÄúIs it travel-sized?‚Äù They also convey that your product makes sense and works for a variety of occasions, therefore raising its value.

# Answer Reliability Questions

buyer‚Äôs want to know how durable and long-lasting a product is going to be, especially with products that are going to experience a lot of wear and tear. Don¬¥t just wait for potential customers to ask if your product is durable or not, tackle it without asking through images.

Providing evidence of product reliability can go a long way, and this can easily be achieved by showing the product in operation or even being tested under realistic conditions.

* So say you are selling a phone case, show non-stop pictures of you dropping it from a height of 5 feet onto a hard surface and it still not breaking = shockproof. Reverse waterproof splash scene ‚Äî this would be a very strong visual to demonstrate the waterproof aspect of the case.¬†

You are offering actual pictures of the item withstanding such conditions, which means you assure clients that this is durable.

This is a simple idea that works to ensure that customers become very clear about the value of the product and also the reliability of the product due to higher trust levels and increased likelihood to purchase.

# Show ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Included‚Äù

Too often, buyers are frustrated because they don‚Äôt know exactly what they are paying for. If customers are not sure if all the required components are included in the package, they are bound to have doubts, resulting in cart abandonment.¬†

How to avoid this: Include images with everything that is included in the product. This removes ambiguity and manages customer expectations correctly.

* If you are providing a kitchen product like a blender, you should show an image with all the parts arranged in an organized manner: base, attachments, an instruction manual, and power wire. Shorthand what is included in the list under each item with text.¬†

That is especially vital for products that are offered with several components or accessories that, the customer may think, are offered additional to that portion.

# Clarify Assembly Requirements

As a result, consumers worry about how hard the product is to assemble when buying assembly-required products.¬†

However, if your product requires assembly, addressing these potential concerns upfront through¬†**listing images**¬†can be impactful. Step by steps ensure customers can do it, if they have doubts about complexity or need special tools.

* So, if you are selling a flat-pack piece of furniture, then perhaps diagram each step of the assembly process. Images of necessary tools Together with each component Is the subject of the product By step If the assembly process is simple, this will take away any doubt regarding complexity, and will also make it seen as a product that is easy to set up.

# Illustrate Safety Features

For several buyers, security is one of the most essential issues especially when this is in regard to a product meant for a child, pet or yourself.¬†

When buyers can see its safety features they are likely to trust that product as well ultimately making a huge impact in their buying decision. Use visuals to show your product safely.

* If you are selling a baby car seat, make sure to display pictures that emphasize on the safety features that the car seat offers: safety locks, side protection, correct installation in a car, etc. Showing a slight variation if a kid is buckled safely in the seat can also add the perception of safety.

# Address Maintenance Concerns

Most of the buyers fear about the maintenance of a product Read more! But on the other hand cleaning or maintenance of the product is easy to handle. Even if the offering is something that potential buyers may wish to get but if the product maintenance is tricky, people may hold back from making the purchase.¬†

Combat this through pictures showcasing the ease of cleaning or maintenance. A simple visual signal can remove any uncertainty and encourage more conversions.

* If you‚Äôre selling a non-stick frying pan, you can have images depicting how its surface would come off easily after use, or easygoing videos of it being placed in a dishwasher without fear. Images of this nature will also show the product necessities in the way of maintenance, which is a real selling point for a lot of customers.

# Common Image Mistakes That Turn Buyers Away

# Poor Image Quality

The most common mistake sellers make is uploading poor-quality images. Photos that are blurry, pixelated, or poorly lit not only make it all but impossible for buyers to see details about a product, but also imply a lack of professionalism in the product or the seller.

¬†Stock or low-quality images can cast unnecessary doubts regarding the genuineness and quality of the product among potential buyers. An unclear or fuzzy image might imply that the seller is hiding defects, or is not interested in putting his product in its best possible form, which might lead to reluctance and cart abandonment.

When it comes to¬†**listing images**, high-resolution, crystal-clear and brightly lit photos portray professionalism as well as transparency. This allows customers to get up close and personal with the product, its texture, its material, and anything unique about it.¬†

Especially for products such as jewelry, clothing, or electronics where every detail may make a difference, high-quality images are crucial.¬†

High quality photography can change the way people look at your stuff so invest in some or use tools, to make images more appealing and help you build a better image of your brand and product.

# Inadequate Lighting

The secret sauce in product photography success is lighting. Bad lighting hides important details and makes it hard for a buyer to see the product. Insufficient lighting that is either too dim or too bright can leave shadows over the item or exaggerate coloration, making the item look very different than it actually does.¬†

This can annoy prospective clients that wonder why what you are selling simply cannot be unique, or unique enough.

* Such hasty spirit is a sure shot to a blunder as fair but smooth lighting should be used to project the true colors of the product. Natural light works well for some products as it gives a neutral and flattering tone.¬†

Or, more simply, shaped light, such as a softbox or light tent, controls the harshness of shadows while gently revealing the details of the product without blowing the highlights. Using the right lighting can foster trust and guarantee that the product is not misrepresented, making a conversion more likely.

# Overly Cluttered Backgrounds

One of the most common mistakes in product photography staging is using backgrounds that are too busy and cluttered. Too busy of a background takes the eyes of the buyer away from the product ‚Äì and can make it look less professional.

* If a background is very busy or is distracting in nature, a buyer might struggle to separate the product from the background and may not get a clear picture of the elements of the product. This person would think the item is less valuable and could become confused or displeased.

One of the simplest ways to make a product stand out is with a blank background. A neutral or solid background is ideal so the attention remains on the product being sold. Occasionally, lifestyle photos where the product is being used are acceptable, but the product still needs to be the focal point of the image.¬†

By having a clean, well-staged background, the seller not only points focus towards the product and all of its features, but also indicates that they have taken the time to present the product as a professional seller should.

# Lack of Multiple Angles

Another common error is to upload only one image of the product. A single shot does not allow the buyer to get a full idea of the design, functionality, or quality of the product.¬†

* For example, customers tend to look at a single product from several angles, such as shape, texture, and how it is likely to fit itself into the customer‚Äôs lives. When you offer just a single image, it may cause doubt to the buyers because they feel like they miss half of what is in the photo.

To avoid this error, use multiple images at different angles for a good view of the product. If you are trying to sell a piece of furniture, include photos of the front, sides, back, and close-ups of important features.¬†

Demonstrate product if relevant, e.g. a person wearing a jacket or a lamp switched on. This diversity offers buyers a complete insight into the product and might have a positive effect on their purchase intention.

# False Or Deceptive Advertising

Inaccurate images, for instance showing photos that are not truly related to the actual product, may prompt potential buyers to turn away.

¬†These can be images with too many features,¬†**listing images**¬†that are overly posed, or images with filters that enhance the colors and texture of the product to the point that the product does not actually look like this.¬†

Buyers are more likely to return products, leave bad reviews and refrain from buying from the seller again when a product does not reflect its image.

The best way to avoid this error is to make sure the images that are used to represent a product, accurately reflect the item that is being sold. It should encompass the colors, proportions, and features of the product without any distortions.¬†

In case the product has variations (like colors options or sizes) use individual images so that it does not lead to confusion. Good images with transparency and authenticity establish credibility and trust, which in turn, leads to increase in sales and repeat customers.

# Ignoring Product Scale

When images are not well conceptualized in terms of scale, sellers often lack the ability to effectively represent product sizes to the buyer. Buyers may have no sense of scale, and without additional photography, they may think the item is smaller (or larger) than it is.¬†

* A photo of something small, like a keychain or pen, may appear larger than anticipated if set within a vacuum with no other objects to reference its size. That might end in disillusionment when the product comes in, which is able to lead to returns.
* You can also try adding reference objects in the photo that buyers can relate to, such as a hand holding the object, or place the product next to everyday objects, for example, place a coffee cup, ruler, or a coin.¬†

These references give customers a better sense of scale to the product, thus allowing them to decide if this product is for them or not. Offering precise size references can help to enhance customer experience and limit returns.

# Not Demonstrating Product Usage or Purpose

This is part of understanding your customer base ‚Äî buyers want to know how the product looks and how it functions. One of the biggest mistakes is not showing the product in action & then potential customers would be unsure if it actually works and whether they actually need it or not.¬†

* As an example, when selling a blender, the static, unassembled product image will not communicate the way it works or how easy it is to use.

# How Image Layouts Influence Buyer Decisions

Having an organized image layout will direct the buyer view in a particular sequence to help them view the most important features of the product at the very beginning. Putting the primary product image at the top or in the center of the layout attracts immediate attention.

¬†Secondary images directly follow with logical sequencing, highlighting close-ups, lifestyle shots or alternate angles.¬†

Not only does this clear hierarchy allow customers to process information quickly, but it also guarantees that they can navigate through the listing images easily to get a complete picture of what the product actually is.

The easier you make it for buyers to view an item from different angles or in different contexts, the more likely they are to be sure about what they‚Äôre purchasing.¬†

# Improving User Experience (UX)

Having a familiar and predictable structure enhances the user experience. If buyers can access relevant information like product size, color options, or essential features, they are more likely to get a pleasant experience on their shopping journey.¬†

The perfect layout of images helps in reducing friction ‚Äì as the time taken to comprehend the product becomes less.¬†

* If you are selling a piece of clothing, for example, you should be able to see an image of the item from the front, back, sides and close up of details of the item such as stitching or fabric so the customer can inspect the product without having to find his/her own pictures.

Some layouts may offer zoom-in features, where users can click to have a closer look at some product information; this is another way to improve the experience by offering the buyer to be in charge of how much they want to see.¬†

Having a simple, structured, and easy to navigate image layout makes it easier for potential customers to buy something from you and accordingly lower the¬†[bounce rates.](http://www.inc.com/samuel-edwards/less-is-more-simple-web-design-and-bounce-rates.html)

# Enabling Product Comparisons

Also, vibrant and intelligent¬†[product comparisons](https://medium.com/gobeyond-ai/how-to-create-a-great-product-comparison-page-to-boost-conversions-a37bf95681fd)¬†are made by prospective buyers in the shopping cart stage of e-commerce. A good image layout makes it easy for them to compare your product to others by simply visualising its unique features and differentiators.¬†

* As an example, if you are marketing a gadget that serves multiple functions, you can show images of the different modes or functions the product offers, highlighting the versatility of the product.¬†

Using strategic placement of¬†**listing images**¬†to highlight these key differentiators will aid customers as they imagine why they should choose your product over another one.

This kind of image display may also play well with comparative charts demonstrating various iterations of a single product (e.g., color comparison, size comparison) alongside each other. This alleviates uncertainty, which is an essential part of the process when closing a sale.¬†

When a buyer can easily compare features and see why your solution is better, the chances they take the next step of shopping are higher.

# Trustworthy Design Through Repeated Web Layouts

Trust plays a vital role in any buying decision, especially when you buy something online, you are not able to physically test a product. An organized image layout can always help in gaining trust as this reflects our efforts and reliability.

¬†If the set of images seem unpolished and appear to be taken by random customers, it creates a doubt in the customer mind if the vendor actually cares about the presentation of their products.¬†

This is especially useful if you carry high-ticket items or products that buyers may be skeptical about their quality or authenticity.

Cohesive image sizes and orientation, along with the usable formats reinforces the identity of a seller as organized and detail-oriented, instilling trust in the customer.¬†

# Improve Product Feature Focus

This sends us to a main element related to image layout: the capacity to highlight the highlights of the item, but without flooding the buyer with each of the data fragmented in a shot. Inserting a layout of call-out text, arrows, or labels into the image can highlight key features.¬†

* So, for instance, if you are selling a high-end kitchen appliance, you can have an image with labeled arrows indicating specific features, say buttons, digital screens, or special attachments.

This way, you create a more informative experience by directing the customer‚Äôs eye towards the product features that matter most. This is especially effective in case of complex products having many features.¬†

A well-structured demo: When the buyer can visualize how each feature would work then they can realize the uniqueness of the product and can feel confident about buying the product.

# Show Scale and Size of a Product¬†

One of the flaws that people often stumble upon while purchasing online is not being able to estimate the size of a product or the scale of an item. This can be eased by providing relatable references within the image layout.¬†

* For instance a product alongside a known object such as a coffee mug, phone, or person can be helpful as it allows buyers to gauge the actual size of the product.¬†

But for a product that is meant to sit on a shelf or be worn, customers will scale relative to their other dimensions, and without these references, customers will either scale even larger or smaller than you intend, and there is potential for disappointment.

This can also be solved by putting measurements in the actual photos. Showing an image of the shelf with labelled dimensions can provide buyers with all the specifications they need to ensure the product will fit into their space.¬†

Helps provide clarity on size and proportions through the layout of the image and decreases uncertainty for buyers and subsequently reason for potential returns.

# Make Interacting With The Product Attractive

An image layout that promotes engagement will lead to increased engagement and, eventually, an increased probability of conversion. With features like 360-degree views, zoom-in view, and an option to view the product from different angles, customers can virtually interact with the product.

* Such a layer of interaction is crucial for high-end or complex products, for example, electronics or luxury products, which buyers usually want to view in detail before purchase.
* Interactive image layouts on your product page offer a more immersive experience and give customers the experience of holding the product in their hands.¬†

Touch-that at least this hands-on approach even in the online world can do wonders when it comes to prompt the final buying action-as it brings out an in-store shopping experience.

# What Do Buyers Look for in Amazon Images?

# Original and Straightforward Product Advertising

Consumers prefer¬†**listing images**¬†that depict an item in its true form since the photos they receive are actually as depicted. While saying ‚Äòless is more‚Äô is usually not entirely appropriate for most things in life, overly polished and edited photos might disappoint buyers or lead to a string of returns.¬†

Real life images depict the facet of the product which has not been altered in any manner, including the color, texture and surface finish of the product.¬†

* For instance, a leather handbag must have photos that zone in on material, which features textural, sewing, and underlying graininess. While these details do tell the quality of the product they also assist in creating confidence in consumers.

Further, authenticity also means presenting the product in a way it is, without putting a lot of makeup on it. For instance, if one is designing a ceramic dinner plate the image should not contain shinny filters if the dinner plate contains matte finishing.

# Realistic Use in Everyday Settings

Purchasers need to understand how they would use a product. Great pictorial images that depict the product in contexts that are familiar encourage customers and emotional buying.

* For instance, a¬†[coffee maker placed](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/20/review-erm-that-aint-cold-brew-spinn/)¬†on a clean kitchen top cup of coffee on the side gives a clue as to how the coffee can enhance one‚Äôs morning routine. It brings the functionality of the product closer to life and enables buyers to easily place the product in their lives.

Lifestyle settings are critical more so for products that are used every other day. Scenes in which a pair of sneakers can be photographed include a person strolling through a park or a person exercising on a treadmill.¬†

* For kitchen appliances, it is perfectly suitable to demonstrate what meal the blender is making as a smoothie, or what meal a slow cooker is great for making.

They also speak about the possibilities to use the product, these settings are realistic. For instance, a multi-functional desk shown in a home office setting together with a computer, books and a cup of coffee gives an idea of how a workspace can adapt to work-from-home.¬†

Likewise, from the comfort of their home, a sofa placed in a cozy living room setting will make buyers imagine how the piece of furniture will look like in their homes.

# Culture and LifeStyle Preferences

* Pictures and other visuals in line with these views may carry a great impact on buying behavior. For example, presenting a set utilized during the holiday, including Thanksgiving or Diwali, captures the buyers ‚Äò attention and makes them visualize the product‚Äôs use. This makes the product more appealing and relatable to the target market due to cultural affinity it has towards the product.

Relevance to lifestyle is also considered important in well defined segments.¬†

* For example, the workout wear worn on different-shaped models in different settings such as gym, a park or even a home fitness equipment section shows that the brand is inclusive. Most consumers desire their images reflected in products or product advertisements.¬†
* For instance, an advertisement that depicts a yoga mat in use at a natural setting such as a garden and inside a cramped up apartment satisfies different types of needs, thus, the product cover‚Äôs a broader mosaic.
* Another important aspect of cultural relevance of the imagery is that it creates trust. For example, if the product is being marketed globally it could be useful to include pictures depicting people of different skin color, dressing style or even different cultural practices, preferences etc.¬†
* For example, the sellers of cookware could put in their visuals examples of recipes from different cultures, appealing to the buyers‚Äô culture.

# Standard Zoomable for Inspection

Purchasing offline stores gives buyers an experience of touching and feeling of the products they are buying. A lack of visible textures and low detail density is counterbalanced by zoomable images that provide customers with detailed observations.

¬†It is valuable for such types of products as jewelry, electronics, luxurious leather accessories, etc., especially if they are bought to be used at business meetings with partners or at other formal occasions.

* For instance, a buyer of a leather wallet will want to inspect the wallet‚Äôs stitches, grain and the embossed logo of the wallet. Image enlargability which allows the customers to examine the quality of the product from¬†**listing images**¬†that are in higher resolution.¬†

Likewise, the use of detailed images for electronics, such as ports, buttons, and screen displays, enables the buyers to better appraise form and features of what they are purchasing.

Another advantage of zoomable images is that they are useful when describing products with some highly relevant technical attributes.¬†

* For instance, a power tool can have detailed shots of attachments, grip, and protective measures in motion; such an aspect helps buyers make judgments on the tool‚Äôs use and construction. For clothing, specific views of fabric, stitches and other details let the buyer make a correct decision about style and wear resistance.

# Images Addressing Concerns

Consumers sometimes have particular issues or questions in mind when choosing and considering buying a particular product. In fact, negating these concerns through¬†**listing images**¬†can rid it all together and foster trust.¬†

* For instance, an adaptor for charging a phone could display animations of how the charger is appropriate for charging phones, tablets and laptops. This can be done with a picture of the charger connected to different kinds of devices with manufacturers‚Äô brands and the devices‚Äô models inscribed on a nearby label.

¬†This is advantageous to the buyer because they are assured about their purchase by being told what they want to hear, that a certain product is compatible with another.

* Another example for kitchen products is a knife set. As for the actual artefacts, buyers question specifically the sharpness of the knives as well as their general sturdiness.

¬†However, touching an image of the knives while they are in use by placing them in a setting such as cutting through a hard vegetable such as pumpkin or even flesh of an animal gives a visual guarantee of their performance.¬†

Two requirements that may cause durability worries can also be addressed with here showing images that depict real testing conditions.¬†

* For instance, a suitcase may be used while demonstrating that it has passed a certain drop test or while demonstrating that it is strong enough to bear a several hundred pounds weight. This puts the mind of the buyer who may have some doubts about the durability level of the product.
* In the case of electronic gadgets, figures that can explain safety features such as overheating protection of the hair straightener can remove safety concerns. Besides, it is useful to have an image where you can depict that people, children, adults, or professionals, can use the product.

# Product Variations in Action

Some purchases are made in different color, size or format, and the buyer would wish to see these options clearly before arriving at a decision. Photographs that present the product with different options used in various applications give the buyer clarity that helps in picking the most suitable variation.¬†

* For example, if a brand selling furniture wants to display a sofa they are selling, IMAGES should depict the same sofa in five different colors on a background depicting a living room setting. In doing so, the buyers can easily have a glimpse of how one variation could fleet with the rest of the interior theme.

It is also a good idea to single out the size or other differences, apart from the colors.¬†

* For example, a travel backpack, the product can be placed on different people where the labels are superimposed on the images of small, medium, and large bags. This also allows buyers to choose the best size for their needs from a given size range available on the market.

Branding brands always stand out when it comes to showcasing product iterations. A dress can be made and sold in several patterns or materials, hence, the models which promote the dress sundress might be of different colour or size.¬†

Besides marking the availability of various choices, it gains access to the broad circle of consumers, thus making people interested in the product.

# Graphics True to Safety and Sustainability

Today‚Äôs consumer provides much emphasis on the safety of the products as well as the environmental effect of the products. Managers need to understand that specific¬†**listing images**¬†that call attention to various aspects of a product like safety and the firm‚Äôs sustainable practices have a strong impact on buyer perception.

* For example, a baby crib could also offer images of how it locks securely and other highlights i.e. side impact and safety certifications such as ASTM or JPMA. However, a picture of the crib along with the badge which shows that it confirms the safety standard of the country also provides the parents confidence about the product.

For products targeted at conscious consumers the imagery associated with sustainability strikes the correct chord.

* For example, a reusable water bottle can have pictures on it that point out such facts as the type of packaging used or the kind of material used in its manufacture. Additionally, one can add an infographic that demonstrates the advantages of using the bottle, comparing it to the single-use plastics to maximize the message about the product‚Äôs sustainability.

A product with labels like organic, biodegradable, or carbon-neutral should be able to clearly indicate these in the visuals used.¬†

* For example, an organic cotton bedding set might include a picture of the bedding set itself on an actual bed in a relaxing bedroom, then place the icons of organic certification, and a short message of how it contributes to the environment on top of it.

1i6mpvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i6mpvb/am_i_wrong_to_want_to_reconcile/,Am I wrong to want to reconcile?,"I (22M) and my ex (22F) recently broke up. It‚Äôs been about two weeks. We were the happiest couple around. We didn‚Äôt ever really argue, and we very rarely fought. We were together for just under a year, and were best friends for well over a year. I made some mistakes, yes. Bad ones. I didn‚Äôt do my fair share around the house. She said it was therapeutic for her, and I accepted that at face value and didn‚Äôt do anything to change that. We didn‚Äôt go on really any dates besides going to dinner. I didn‚Äôt buy her enough flowers. The usual things that happen when someone moves in and one party gets too comfortable. I‚Äôm not good at picking up hints, and didn‚Äôt realize that was bothering her. I‚Äôm a mentally ill man. I suffer from pretty bad anxiety. I would overthink about her cheating and things like that, but I still wholeheartedly trusted her. One night, I drank too much. We got into an argument about nothing. I ended up yelling at her. I proclaimed that she loved this guy who she doesn‚Äôt even talk to. I didn‚Äôt mean it. I said I wouldn‚Äôt regret the fight. She spent the night at a friend‚Äôs house. 

I woke up the next morning, remembering what I had said, and felt horrible. I love this girl with my whole heart. Seriously. I trust her with every ounce of my being, and was honestly thinking about proposing within the next few months. She said she‚Äôd work on it with me and I picked her up. She stayed with me that night, and I honestly thought we would work through this. 

The next day she went to spend time with her friends and a friend‚Äôs place. She wasn‚Äôt acting distant; still telling me she loved me all night and day. She was set to come home the next day when I was at work. I checked her location and saw she was home, so I decided to take an early lunch and surprise her with flowers and tell her I love her. She had all her things packed, and she wasn‚Äôt there anymore by the time I got home. She moved out later that day. 

She and I had a respectful final parting. Both of us crying and me begging her to stay. She said she needed to go, so I didn‚Äôt try to stop her again. She went and moved back in with her folks. 

I am having a really hard time even getting out of bed without her. I genuinely love this girl so much. Enough that I‚Äôm not just attached to her, but her love. I have had serious relationships before this, but they all felt like business. This is a different feeling. One I don‚Äôt want to get over. 

The next day after the breakup, I called her and just cried to her on the phone. She said she would like me to come over to talk the next morning. I did. I brought her coffee, breakfast, and roses. We had a great conversation. After the conversation, we just cuddled and told each other how much we loved each other. I rubbed her back for hours while we just laid together. It ended with me leaving to her saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù.

That was about two weeks ago. She says she still has love in her heart, but was too disrespected by me to ever get back with me, and that she wants space. I can‚Äôt seem to give it to her. I lived with this girl, I work with this girl, I love this girl. She‚Äôs a saint. All the problems were my fault. 

I knew I needed a change when she broke it off with me. I started therapy, which is going well. I‚Äôm unpacking a lot of my problems, and it seems to be working. I haven‚Äôt had a drop of alcohol since she left. I‚Äôm genuinely working to change. This is for myself, but also partially for her. She is maintaining that she needs space, and that she wants to be friends down the road. I just find all this confusing. 

At work on Monday we talked. She said she was comfortable talking to me, but the next day said she needed space and time to heal. I‚Äôm giving her that. But I also have to see her 5 times a week, and this is getting very hard to not reach out when she is all I think about. She was my best friend and the love I had for her was the deepest I‚Äôve ever experienced. I know I am the problem, but I am working to fix myself for her. I just don‚Äôt see how she can notice it at the moment. I‚Äôm really trying with everything in my being. I want to make this work with her, and plan to wait until she is ready; if she ever is. I promised her and God the day she left that with another chance, I‚Äôd be the man she deserves. 

I guess my real question is, in your experiences, am I wrong to want to reconcile, to wait for her, and to even believe there‚Äôs a chance that she can have a change of heart and forgive me?

Its so hard to tell if she's interested because all of the things she does can easily be dismissed as being nice or friendly. I try to approach her as much as I can but its not easy as the church is small and crammed, so we talk every once in a while when I get an opportunity.

I'm pretty confident she's within my league, and I really want to ask her out for coffee but at this point I'm still not convinced I have a chance based on our interactions. 

I try to make eye contact across the room and wave, but she avoids eye contact. She never really makes an effort to ""bump"" into me or anything, I always have to do this. 

However, the most promising thing is she remembers small details

* I have a non-English, hard to pronounce, name that she easily remembered when we first met. After we talked again the second time there was no ""I forgot your name"", which is what 99% of people say. 
* I was gone for 1 month and the week I got back we chatted and she said ""you were gone for a while""
* She remembered some plans I had made for the weekend and the following weekend asked how that went.

I picked up a Shark IQ 2 in 1 vacuum mop on Black Friday at Walmart for $98. I own 2 other robot vacs but really wanted one that mops as well.  This is just a basic vac mop with no self emptying base station. But I am OK with the basic maintenance after each use and not convinced the self emptying is worth the worth the extra cost and maintenance. I have been so tickled with the combo for going on 2 months with twice weekly mopping instead of about twice a year before. The problem is It doesn't clean dried on stains like bone broth and coffee very well. The Shark IQ has the mop pad it drags around and that moves a little while cleaning. I have done tons of research and this basic mop seems to work fine for a lot of people and it does keep the the dust down, but I think spinning mop pads would perform better. So I am looking for good budget options for a basic vacuum/mop that has spinning mop pads.  I have a small 1 bedroom apartment with all laminate or tile floors, plus I have a short haired dog.

1i6mizq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BYD/comments/1i6mizq/byd_showroom_experience_netherlands/,BYD Showroom Experience - Netherlands,"So I am interested in a new car and had heard about BYD from various people and had visited China last year and seen some on the roads and in showrooms. All very impressive and I wanted to find out more.

So I booked a test drive in the Seal U DM-I as we are interested in a hybrid rather than full EV. Booking experience was great, all online via their tool, pick a showroom, date and time and got a confirmation in the mail a few mins later. This was great, as other brands want to have someone call you and do it over the phone.

We went to the showroom found someone and they directed me to the salesperson who would deal with the test drive. They told me that the car was not back yet, would i like a coffee etc. No problem, we just looked around the showroom for 5 mins and then we got the keys. All standard stuff and nothing bad but nothing great.

The test drive itself went fine and I quite liked the car. It drove well and came with lots of comfort and tech, for the price point its a bit a steal.

Then came the chat after the drive about purchasing, which is where it all started to go a bit downhill. I wanted to know about both the lease and finance options. To be able to compare my options.

The first curveball was about my residency. I had not been asked that before at other dealerships. We are UK citizens on a ""temporary"" Brexit visa that expires this year and will be renewed to permanent. I was told I would not be able to finance or lease with my current residency. Not withstanding that I have a mortgage and permanent employment contract. Very strange but not a deal breaker, I can renew it early anyway. Just very strange that this was a detour that we made.

The salesperson then gave me the lease numbers and I was a bit shocked. They were coming out significantly more expensive than an equivalent Kia Sportage PHEV costing nearly 10k more sales price. Something of the order of 90EUR/month more on a 48 month 10k kms lease. Wild.

Then they said they could not quote me the finance in the showroom, and would have to take the details and send it over to me. Again strange, but not a deal breaker or anything. Usually the salesperson wants to send you out armed with all the information you need.

The salesperson had no idea how to advise me on a balloon payment amount for a finance quote, no indication of future value or anything. So I just had to ""guess"". Not something that more mainstream dealers asked, some will even guarantee the final value. Anyway, took my details and said would send it over.

Got the email the next day and it was another joke. Interest rate of 9.99%. This is just not competitive with other brands in the market, Kia offer 4.99% and Ford offering a staggering 0.99%. For the numbers I gave, the difference between 4.99 and 9.99 is about 4k over the life of the agreement..

As I understand, BYD are very new to the market in Europe and trying to break into the mainstream. Their vehicle prices reflect this and are very compelling. But unless you bring your own finance or can afford the full purchase the overall offer is not competitive at all. I just cant understand why, all things considered, I would want to buy/lease a BYD (at least the model I am interested in) based on this offer. BYD does not have the brand recognition nor prestige for me to ""want"" a BYD at more expense, their brand seems to be built on quality at a low price. Its all a little baffling to me.

Bring on top of that the lacklustre experience from the sale person who didn't really seem to care (or be able to do anything about it), they were keen to hand me off to the finance department to talk on the phone acting more like a receptionist than a sales person.

Based on this experience as a whole, it brings quite a lack of confidence in the brand. With  me left wondering if I would receive great service as a customer when they already have my money.

If BYD is serious about attracting customers like me they need to sort out their overall offer including lease and finance pricing and make it competitive.

Does this experience match others in the Netherlands or other countries? Am I missing something big here?",2,1737476951.0,BYD,0,1.0,False

It may sound like a frivolous, non-important quest but I'm really trying to make my required self-care more joyful, so any suggestions would be really wonderful! 

I need to have my pills portioned out daily or else I forget if I've taken them already that day or I'm just remembering taking them yesterday (feels ironic that the thing that fixes my inability to remember shit requires that I remember to do something every day). I also need ones with morning and night compartments (they don't have to be labeled AM/PM, I just need 2x compartments per day). 

I need to have the pill organizer out on the counter, normally beside my coffee machine, or I forget to take them. I don't mind having it out on the counter where people can see it so it doesn't need to be disguised or anything and it doesn't need to be portable since it sits there every day, but at the moment I have an ugly pink plastic organizer sitting front and centre in my lovely, modern kitchen. 

I've seen a few wood ones on Etsy which are really elegant but they don't match my kitchen super well (polished concrete counters/matte black fixtures). In my head I'm picturing a beautiful stone or ceramic one, but so far no such luck.

1i6mbwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1i6mbwl/milan_on_a_budget_trip_report/,Milan on a budget: trip report,"I went to Milan for a weekend.

Tips:

Pre-book the Duomo and The Last Supper, this one I booked 2 months in advance.  There are discounts at basically all galleries and museums if you are under 26.   Including flights and accomodation, I spent ¬£230 total with ¬£100 on travel (half of this was travel to and from each airport about ¬£12.50 each for 4 journeys), ¬£70 on the hotel and the rest on attractions + food.  I used the Metro only once but I had to wait 6 minutes for a train.

Saturday

05:00 wake up, (06:00) Milan time, land in Milan Malpensa, from London Gatwick, at 12:00.  
Take train to Milan Central Station and then arrive at hotel at 14:00.  
Chill in room, use toilet, eat packed lunch, and power nap until 15:00.

Walk to Duomo Plaza through the Indro Montanelli Gardens and some wonderful shopping streets looking at the window displays.  Everyone was so well dressed, I was very impressed.  
Get to Duomo Plaza, look at the Duomo from the outside (very cool).  
Walk through the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and look in the shop windows.  A bit underwhelming, the shop displays were nothing special and it was packed.  Nothing to do except shop tbh and I don't have much money.

16:15 See the Leonardo Da Vinci Statue.  Go to the Gallerie d'Italia and stayed there for 2 hours.  It is like a mini Tate Britain, focusing only on art made in Milan.  The modern and contemporary section was excellent, but the historical section was underwhelming, it had a few excellent paintings but many that were in poor condition and the descriptions throughout the museum over-egged the importance of the paintings.  It's definitely worth a visit.

18:30 Had pizza for dinner at Piz then walked to the Naviglio Grande and walked around, it was pretty cool and very touristy.  I planned on going to a couple of bars that I had been recommended but I was exhausted and went to bed early.



Sunday

06:00 woke up, ate my pre-prepared breakfast.  Checked out of the hotel and arrived at the Central Station for 07:00 where I looked around and it's a pretty impressive and imposing station (it was the only place I assumed would be open on a Sunday morning).

It was really dark and the streets were dead quiet so I just walked around.  I walked through the Biblioteca degli Alberi Milano park to the Piazza Gae Aulenti, then to the Porta Garibaldi arch before getting a coffee, a snack, and reading my magazine at Caffetteria Baiamonti.

By the time I was finished, it was about 8:30 and light outside and I walked to the Cemetary Entrance, which looked very cool and then walked through Chinatown to the Arco Della Pace, which was beautiful with some interesting history as well.  I then walked through the Parco Sempione, which was pretty underwhelming and had a look at the Castello Sforzesco from the back before walkeint to the Brera.

I got to the Brera around 9:45 but it took me a while to find the entrance, which was up the stairs, and I spent a while just walking around the empty ground floor, which was pretty interesting anyways.  The art gallery was fantastic and the descriptions were excellent.  I was particularly impressed by the paintings by Hayez and Mantegna.  The layout of the gallery was also very solid.

I left at 11:15 to get to the Duomo for 11:30 and was in the Duomo/ on the roof for about an hour.  The inside was stunning and there was a service on.  The roof was also fabulous and walking among the spires was a once in a lifetime experience and the whole thing was probably the highlight of the whole trip.

I got lunch at Un'Altra Pasta, which I thought was a pasta place but they only had pizza and it was delicious.  I then walked back through the Duomo Plaza, eating my packed lunch there, had another look at the Duomo and then walked to the Castello Sforzesco.

I got to the castle at around 13:30 but I unwound for a bit just sitting in the courtyard overlooking a pond.  The castle was nice and the museum was good too, especially the Michaelangelo statue.  I had seen pictures of it and thought it would be a bit shit, but it was presented incredibly well and looked great.  The main museum was interesting but I left there at 16:30 to get to The Last Supper.

I got to The Last Supper 15 minutes early and was on a guided tour.  The tour guide was excellent and explained the painting really well, what is going on, why it is important, and what it did differently.  The tour lasts for an hour, 30 mins about The Last Supper and 30 mins about the Church itself.  I only went on the first half of the tour and we got 15 minutes in front of The Last Supper which is a great amount of time especially compared to the 0.5 seconds you get in front of the Mona Lisa.

I then walked to the Duomo to see it lit up in the dark and then walked to Milano Cadorna Station to get a train to Malpensa airport.  The airport terminal (Terminal 2 gates D and E) was tiny, looked ugly with a poor selection of shops and 1.80 Euros for water, but security was very fast.  I did 42,000 steps this day btw.

  
Overall, would definitely recommend Milan for a weekend away.  I saw everything I wanted to see and would go back again.

1i6mafe,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i6mafe/i_broke_up_with_a_very_good_guy/,I broke up with a very good guy ,"Sounds so stupid, but he was and still is a great guy. We‚Äôve had some issues for some months now, and honestly it‚Äôs been so many small things that it‚Äôs just accumulated over time. I wish I had a specific thing to tell him, but I don‚Äôt. I wish I had a reason myself, so at least I wouldn‚Äôt walk around feeling like I made a huge mistake. 
In short, my problem with him was that he didn‚Äôt seem very interested in taking care of himself. Mentally and physically, but also putting me before him almost all of the time. (Or so it felt like)

We met for a coffee last night, and didn‚Äôt even get a coffee. I started off saying that I‚Äôve been so hot and cold lately, and that I can go a whole day feeling like it‚Äôs completely worth saving, and nothing can break us - to feeling like it‚Äôs all become too much and I just need it to end. It‚Äôs been eating me up inside, especially since I couldn‚Äôt make up my mind. And it‚Äôs been hurting him too, because I‚Äôve gone so much back and forth. 
We talked for a bit, and he mentioned that he had found my Reddit. Welp.. looking back on what I‚Äôve written about him it‚Äôs all been true, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been too harsh, but that‚Äôs not how he should have figured it out.  I think I came to Reddit to look for an answer on what I should do - while I was the one who needed to figure it out. And instead i just hurt him more, and I didn‚Äôt even bring it up to him. I should have taken all that I wrote and sent it to him instead, but for various reasons I didn‚Äôt feel like that was an option. That is one or the mistakes I‚Äôve made during this. 

He felt like we were in a good place and had good communication, while I felt we were in a make it or break it point, and our communication was troublesome. I feel like I could have taught him a lot of good communication techniques, but I also could have used them myself. Again, another mistake on me. 

After we ended it I followed him to the metro.  He had to leave fast as the metro was already by the platform, and I gave him a quick hug and then waited for the metro to leave. It didn‚Äôt, for a few (very long) seconds. We stood watching each other, both of us on the verge of tears. I signed ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to him, and he very hesitantly signed back right before I decided to turn around and leave. It was harder to watch him sign it back hesitantly that it would have been if he didn‚Äôt. 

As soon as I got behind a wall all my emotions came up. I hadn‚Äôt cried properly up until then, and atp I was hulking down the hallway. I truthfully wish he had chased after me and said ‚Äúfuck that im gonna make this work no matter what‚Äù and taken me home. Maybe that would have convinced me that he‚Äôs actually gonna do the work this time, and that all the pain is gonna be worth it. But that‚Äôs not fair of me to ask or expect of him. I left him, and he‚Äôs not really the person who puts himself first in this situation. He respect me and my choices, and for that I love him. Im just thinking it would have made me last just a bit longer, and have some faith that he really cares enough to do the work this time..

He didn‚Äôt, and I heard a message over the speakers saying that all the metros are blocked. I walked around aimlessly hoping that he, as most others got off, and that I‚Äôd see him again. I walked back and forth, on both sides and eventually got a message from my friend that I could come over. 

I spent the rest of the night crying, debating if I made a mistake or if it‚Äôs the best choice. All in all im proud of myself for taking such a hard choice, but ashamed over myself for how it all happened. 
Given that he‚Äôs found my Reddit there‚Äôs a good chance he‚Äôll see this. I don‚Äôt know if I hope he does or not, but I‚Äôd definitely stalk his Reddit if I had it lol. I hope if he does find it that it gives him some closure knowing this has been rough for me too, and that he doesn‚Äôt blame himself for not doing the things he didn‚Äôt know I wanted. I hope it doesn‚Äôt confuse him further. 

I‚Äôve spent all of today with a racing and heavy heart, beating out of my chest. At times I feel content with my choice, and I try to hold on to that. After all I need to treat this as a break up and not hold onto hope that we‚Äôll get back together - or I won‚Äôt be able to get past this. On top of all this I‚Äôve got a throat problem and I‚Äôm a hypochondriac sooo im convinced I have throat cancer. Im having anxiety like NEVER before and I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself other than just try to take it one step at a time, and try to be better than the last one.

The important thing to start asking is HOW MUCH will it cost you to leave and what costs you need to be aware of (for a family of 3).

We spent about 30k to move internationally to the Netherlands. I‚Äôm gonna break it down and tell WHY it was so much. Some of the costs are in euros. At the time the exchange rate was ‚Ç¨1:1.12USD. Here‚Äôs how we spent the first 11K.

8000USD for rental deposit (2 months rent) and the first months rent.  
3055USD for the Makelaar (think realtor).

Here's the thing about housing. There's availability. The problem is how much you want to spend. The public system is amazing here and you can take a train/bus anywhere, so it's better to find housing outside of the major cities.¬†

We used a makelaar to help us find housing. They cost up to 1 months rent, but they WILL find you a place within your budget. We were specific about a few things; we asked for somewhere with elevator access, partially furnished (as in the apartment had floors and kitchen appliances), 3 bedrooms, and near public transportation. Everything else was negotiable.¬†

As immigrants we are pretty low on the totem pole when it comes to getting chosen since we would be applying without our visas being approved yet. This means that rent-for the first year at least-is going to be higher since you‚Äôll have to choose a private landlord. Once you get a resident permit, you‚Äôll have many more options.¬†

We know there‚Äôs apartments available for 1300-1800euros. We ended up with a rental for ‚Ç¨2300 (2560 with the service fees- almost all rentals will have service fees) because we had to go the private landlord route. Ours was a little more costly because it's right in the city center, near a famous Dutch hotel. We had a strict timeline to move, so we accepted it because we didn‚Äôt know when or if another offer that good would come our way again. Our lease started in August and we moved in September. If you have a little more time you may be able to wait it out and find a lower cost place. The makelaar did the virtual tour and they negotiated with the landlord to make our application more acceptable by telling us what information to include. We paid the standard deposit and 1st months rent. Some people will try to offer a bigger deposit or more rent upfront to secure housing. A good makelaar will advise you on what‚Äôs best for YOUR situation.¬†

So overall I would say the experience was pleasant. The makelaar was 3050USD (the exchange rate and taxes jacked the price up a bit). The total monthly rent for the apartment is ‚Ç¨2560about 2700usd). MORE than we wanted to pay but we have about 1200sqft which is very large for a Dutch house, 3bedrooms, 1 level apartment. There‚Äôs appliances, washer/dryer and a deep freezer. I kid you not, the grocery store is a 30sec walk from our building, the city hall, bus station and train station is a 5 min walk and all of it can be seen from our apartment windows. We‚Äôre about 15mins by train away from Amsterdam. 

We used Orange Homes relocation company. They do a free consultation and they‚Äôll tell you what to expect reasonably. We had to provide bank statements to prove income AND savings. It seems kind of nuts, the information you need, but they were able to secure us a place within 2 weeks which is almost unheard of. My only advice is to be firm on costs (within reason) and flexible on location. If you want a bigger apartment with more rooms, closer to a major city, expect to pay more. [Funda.nl](http://Funda.nl) will give you a good idea of what kind of prices you can expect to see.

But that‚Äôs how we spent the first 11k. Then we had lawyer fees. Everyone says the paperwork is very easy to understand and to submit. But we were moving with a small child and doing all the work from the U.S. We really needed peace of mind and for everything to go right and get accepted the first time. This is the cost for the lawyer we used, you might can use it to shop around for lower rates.

‚Ç¨1,450 Lawyer for DAFT  
‚Ç¨950 Partner Residence Permit application (you could do this yourself. We ended up paying because my application got accepted REALLY quickly).¬†  
‚Ç¨385 Residency Permit application child  
‚Ç¨250 Household Goods Removals (we ended up firing the company they referred us to and it saved us THOUSANDS, but we still had to pay a ‚Ç¨1000 penalty)

We chose to go with the lawyer-and we‚Äôre very glad we did- because they took care of a lot. They set all the appointments and we just had to show up. They made the appointment at the bank for us to get accounts (you‚Äôll need this in order to get cell phones, internet provider, etc), appointment at city hall for us to get registered, appointment at the IND to get our resident permits. They reviewed our business plan to make sure it had all the necessary information. They did all the paperwork for the DAFT and resident permit.

The IND charges their own fees but its not paid up front. The Dutch invoice you for everything lol So you only pay once your paperwork has been accepted and processed. But this is the breakdown of the fees for 2024:

IND DAFT application fee: approx¬† ‚Ç¨380¬†¬†  
IND Dependent residence permit application fee:¬† approx¬† ‚Ç¨228   
IND Dependent application fee per minor:¬† approx. ‚Ç¨76

The DAFT startup fees are paid after you arrive in the Netherlands and when you go to register your business:

KVK (chamber of commerce) registration fee: approx ‚Ç¨ 95.¬†  
A minimum of¬† ‚Ç¨4,500 deposit into a Dutch bank account (this amount must remain in the bank).  
‚Ç¨350 to a CPA to get a certified balance sheet that the funds have been deposited.

We had already decided to downgrade our house and we were in the process of purging over the course of 2 years or so. Sell whatever you can and start early, that way you don‚Äôt have to settle for less because you‚Äôre in a rush.   
  
5300usd 20Ft Shipping container  
2800usd packers/movers in the US  
‚Ç¨300 port fees in Netherlands (waiting to have customs clear the container)‚Ç¨640 movers in Netherlands

The shipping company we chose was Omega shipping. They gave us a 20ft container with no weight restrictions and a flat price of 5300 USD. The first shipping company wanted over ‚Ç¨12,000 and they had weight restrictions. It was door to door service, but honestly it wasn‚Äôt that expensive to hire our own movers. We got rid of more stuff in a bid to save money. I recommend choosing a shipping company that‚Äôs not a middle man. You can save on packers/movers by having friends help load the container. It was about 1400usd to have them put everything in storage and another 1400usd for them to load the shipping container from the storage unit. Again, we had a tight timeline, so we needed everything out of the rental house by a certain time. The company brought the container to us and we just needed to load it. I was pregnant and my husband has a bad back so we chose to hire help, but if you have people that can help you, use them.¬†

We ended up paying port fees because it took customs a day longer to approve everything. The movers here unpacked the container and moved everything into the house in under an hour. Shipping usually takes about 6-8 weeks, for us it took about 3.5 weeks. Great because we had our stuff early, but not so great because we were still getting set up and we weren‚Äôt quite ready.¬†

The last little bit of costs was travel, hotel and car rental.¬†

200usd for car rental the week before leaving the U.S.  
385usd for Hotel the week before leaving. You can probably save on this by staying with family.  
1900usd for one way flights (2 adults and 1 child)  
‚Ç¨80 for the taxi from Amsterdam hotel to our home (that‚Äôs fairly standard)

It‚Äôs not been an issue finding childcare, schools, doctors. Some facilities may have waiting lists, but they made it real easy to understand. Relocation companies will also offer you services to help you get enrolled in schools, find doctors, get signed up with health insurance. 

The company we chose wanted to charge ‚Ç¨550 to find a school. The youth center a.k.a. childrens pediatrician gave us the list for free. 

Once you are here, you literally have to start from scratch. We had planned a trip in July and we brought as many suitcases and carry on as the Airline would allow. We packed them full of kitchen stuff, some toiletry, toys, linens, winter clothes, baby items, etc. Things we would need in a new house whilst waiting for our household goods to arrive. All together we had 14 pieces of luggage. 

2 suitcases each, 2 carry ons each (we checked these at the gate) and 2 baby items. Strollers and car seats are free checked luggage that doesn't count against you. We wrapped them in blankets and linens and stuffed them in a checked airport bag. We actually packed pots and pans inside the infant carrier. Once we got to the Netherlands we rented a storage unit and left about 90% of the luggage behind. We had done some shopping for some stuff that we knew we would need. 

If you know you're going to move soon, I would highly recommend doing this. It was about ‚Ç¨80 a month for the storage unit and it was very convenient to have things we DIDN'T have to buy.

On our final flight here, we had about 10 pieces of luggage. This contained more small kitchen and toiletry items, a lot of clothes, shoes and other comfort items that we didn't want to put on the ship. We used the same system, 2 suitcases, 2 carry ons that got checked at the gate and baby items. 

In the first week we spent several hundred euros on groceries and small kitchen appliances. We needed new toasters, electric kettles, coffee maker. Electronics like our computer and tv needed the compatible cords or adapters. Some people would say to just buy your electronics here, but they can be quite expensive. 

Both of our computers added up to around 4k. We took them to UPS and they wrapped them for about 200usd total. If we had sold them we would not have gotten a good price for them and we would have had to spend close to ‚Ç¨6000 to replace what we had. Paying UPS to wrap them is a WAYYYY cheaper than selling and buying knew, but do your own cost analysis. 

If you choose a shipping company that doesn't charge by the volume then you can save more money in the end by bringing more of your furniture and spending less money to replace. We had fired the first company a week before  pick up was scheduled, so we had already sold/given away a lot of things. It meant we had to spend another couple thousand making our house a home once we arrived.

Anyways, this is our breakdown how much it took to move out of America and into the Netherlands. If you made it this far, I hope it helps you. We had done a LOT of research on our own and I found it to be very frustrating that no one would post the numbers of what they spent. I understand that my experience would be different, my expenses would be different; but having some does a lot to put things in perspective. 

In case you're curious, I've also included a breakdown of our current monthly bills.
