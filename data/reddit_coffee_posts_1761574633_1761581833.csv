\_Lisa’s POV\_ I had always been an outcast in my own home. I lived in the Nightshade Pack, but unlike other wolves my age, I had not yet shifted. At twenty-one, I was supposed to be a strong and capable werewolf, but my wolf had never emerged. Because of this, I was the subject of constant ridicule. The pack saw me as weak, and even my own family treated me as if I were invisible. My elder sister, Roxanne, was the golden child. Beautiful, strong, and adored by everyone, Roxanne had everything I lacked. My parents doted on her, praising her achievements and celebrating every milestone in her life. I, on the other hand, was simply cast aside, as if I didn’t belong. Even worse, Roxanne was dating Kael Blackthorn, the Alpha’s son. That only made things harder for me, as Roxanne used every opportunity to flaunt her perfect life in front of me. Today was Roxanne’s birthday, and our mother had gone all out to ensure everything was perfect. A lavish party had been planned at our home, with a beautiful red dress bought especially for Roxanne. She had invited her closest friends, and I had been given one task: to serve the guests and make sure my sister was happy. My own birthday had passed a few months ago, but there had been no celebration. No cake, no gifts, not even a mention of it. It frustrated me, but I had long since learned that voicing my feelings wouldn’t change anything. I had asked my parents before why Roxanne was treated so differently, why they always acted as if I didn’t exist. Their answer had always been the same: Roxanne was the eldest, and I had to make sacrifices for her happiness. Roxanne was their favorite, and they saw nothing wrong in admitting it. Tonight, as I looked at myself in the mirror, adjusting the navy blue dress I had chosen, I refused to let the unfairness of it all ruin my evening. Even if I was nothing more than a waitress at this party, I would at least look presentable. Just as I was adding the final touch of light makeup, my bedroom door burst open. Roxanne stood there with her perfectly curled hair cascading down her shoulders. She had painted her lips a deep red. She looked stunning in her new dress—our mother had picked it out just for her. “What are you doing here?” she snapped, her eyes narrowing. “Shouldn’t you be downstairs getting things ready?” “I was just finishing up,” I said calmly, trying to keep my voice steady. “I’ll be down in a minute.” Roxanne scoffed and stepped further into my room. “You’re so lazy, Lisa. No wonder no one notices you.” Before I could respond, she grabbed a bottle of my face cream from the dresser and poured it all over my dress. I gasped, stepping back in shock as the creamy liquid seeped into the fabric, ruining it completely. “Roxanne!” I shrieked, my hands trembling as I tried to wipe off the mess. “Why would you do that?” She crossed her arms and smirked. “Because you’re embarrassing, Lisa. Who do you think you are trying to look nice? Do you really think someone will notice you? No one cares what you wear. You’re nothing but an unwanted burden in this house.” Tears stung my eyes as I ran out of my room, calling for our mother. When she saw me, her face twisted in disapproval. “What have you done now, Lisa?” she asked while crossing her arms. “It wasn’t me! Roxanne ruined my dress!” I pleaded, my voice breaking. Our mother sighed, shaking her head. “Roxanne would never do something like that. Stop trying to get attention and go change. There’s a lot to do.” Roxanne stood beside her, smirking in satisfaction. “Honestly, Lisa, you’re so dramatic. You should be grateful we even let you be part of this night.” I clenched my fists. My chest ached from the familiar sting of rejection. Without another word, I turned and went back to my room to find another dress—an old one, plain and dull. By the time I came downstairs, the guests had already started arriving. I quickly made my way to the kitchen, pouring different soft drinks into glasses. The vibrant colors looked beautiful under the dim lighting, but I barely had the energy to appreciate it. Balancing the tray, I stepped into the main hall and began serving the guests. Most of them were girls around Roxanne’s age—her friends. As I handed a drink to one of them, she smiled politely. “Oh, you must be Lisa, right? Roxanne’s younger sister?” she asked. I nodded, managing a small smile. “Yes.” Before we could continue the conversation, Roxanne appeared beside us. “Don’t bother talking to her,” she said, laughing. “She’s not very interesting. She’s just here to serve the drinks, like a good little maid.” Her friends giggled, eyeing me with amusement. “She’s really your sister?” one of them asked. “She doesn’t even look like she belongs here.” Roxanne smirked. “Well, she doesn’t. She’s an embarrassment to the family.” Heat rose to my cheeks, and I bit the inside of my cheek to keep myself from lashing out. I didn’t say a word—I just turned and walked away, focusing on my task. I had endured this treatment for so long that I had learned not to react. Then, the room fell silent. I looked up and saw them—Alpha Alexis, Luna Grace, and their son, Kael. The Alpha and Luna rarely attended simple pack events, so their presence was a shock. But Kael was Roxanne’s boyfriend, so his arrival wasn’t surprising. My parents rushed to greet them. Kael pulled Roxanne into his arms, kissing her on the lips in front of everyone. The sight made my stomach twist. I had nothing against their relationship, but the way Roxanne flaunted it, as if she had won some great prize, made me sick. “Lisa!” Roxanne’s voice rang out, sharp and demanding. “Go bring some drinks for me and Kael.” I nodded and hurried to the kitchen. I prepared the drinks and placed them on a tray, steadying my hands before walking back into the hall. As I approached, I felt Kael’s eyes on me. “Roxanne, is that your sister?” he asked, his deep voice sending an unexpected shiver down my spine. “What’s her name? I haven’t seen her around much.” Roxanne laughed, linking her arm through his. “Oh, you don’t need to bother about her. She’s not that interesting. She’s just the family failure. You should focus on me.” She tilted his chin up and kissed him again, as if marking her territory. I had had enough. I set the tray down on the coffee table and turned away. No matter what I did, I would always be invisible to them. But deep down, I knew something was about to change. I just didn’t know how soon it would happen—or how much it would alter my life forever.",1,1761581706.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

* Memes about academia, advisors, and never-ending citations
* Study motivation and burnout discussions

A few years ago, I genuinely thought I was done for. Burned out, anxious, living on caffeine and autopilot, I convinced myself something deep inside was *broken*.  

Spoiler: I wasn’t broken. I was unsupported.  

When I finally sought help — through community, counseling, and resources that actually taught me how to rebuild — everything started to shift. Not overnight. Not perfectly. But steadily, like finding sunlight after too long underground.  

---

**Here’s what I wish someone had told me sooner:**  

- **You don’t need to fix yourself — you need to resource yourself.**  
  No one thrives in isolation. Growth isn’t about becoming someone else; it’s about creating the structure that helps you *be* yourself.  

- **Support ≠ weakness. Support = sustainability.**  
  The people who look strongest aren’t doing it alone. They just have systems — habits, communities, and mindsets — that back them up when life collapses on Tuesday at 3 p.m.  

- **Willpower is overrated. Environment is everything.**  
  Set yourself up to succeed by designing your surroundings, not just relying on motivation that fades faster than your morning coffee.  

---

That’s exactly why I wrote **_Addiction Counseling: A Path to Recovery and Healing_** — a guide built from what actually helps people rebuild instead of just “cope.”  

Here are a few takeaways from it:  
- Recovery isn’t linear — it loops, slides, and spikes, and that’s okay.  
- Emotional honesty heals faster than denial ever could.  
- Finding your tribe can save you years of silent struggle.

My boyfriend's clingy family is wealthy but depend on him for everything. I want him to set boundaries so that he can focus on our future and his peace.

Full post :   
  
Throwaway because duh. I (24F Indian) am an analyst at a tech startup. My boyfriend (28M) is the director of operations at the same company. He’s smart, driven, and has a lot of charisma. He rolls up in a fancy SUV, his fits are on point and I have been told by other colleagues that his watches cost more than annual salaries of some working here. He’s private about money, but the office gossip swears his family’s loaded based on his mom’s FB posts about their holiday homes(yes, plural) and his sister’s hospital Insta flexing their charity PR. Nobody knows the full story I dont even know how these guys are getting readind these posts but the rumor mill’s always buzzing.

I grew up middle class but I always had big dreams. When I joined the company, I was crushing on him since day 1. He and I are both from the same part of a different state so I broke ice with that. I’ll admit, I put in work with my best sarees, coffee break chats, asking about his startup ideas. It was subtle but it worked. We’ve been dating fiveish months, and it’s electric. We stay up late debating tech trends, travel destination and business ideas. I’m falling hard, and I want to think he is too but I cant tell. We havent posted 'us' on socials yet.

Here’s the problem: his family is relentless. Everybody depends on him for everything but I dont think they need to. His mom calls constantly to talk about her socialite friends drama or family drama or redecorating dilemmas or investment questions on him. His sister (34F) who is married has her own hospital with her husband (34M) still needs him to weigh in on a lot. Why are you depending on my man for for planning YOUR fancy charity events and calling him on OUR date night to ask for updates. I mean, girl do something on your own and while you are at it ask your husband to do something too. Both of you are doctors who own a god damn hospital ffs!! Or just hire helpers like normal rich people and dont bother my man. His teenage cousins treat him like a substitute dad and they keep texting for homework help or expecting him to show up at their school events because their parents are 'not there'. I dont even know what this means cuz this is all that he'll tell me. I am guessing they are partying or travelling or both but your guess is as good as mine. It’s not just about money it’s emotional labor. He feels personally responsible for all of them. They are adults who should be managing their own lives and cleaning up their own mess. He invited most of the office to his house for a Holi party. His house is amazing, legit huge and decorated so tastefully. We were not yet dating. I saw him step away to take a 15-20 minute call from his mom. I saw him talking on the phone and he looked pretty upset and shaken. He quickly went back to stioc but now I wasnt sure if he was the same guy I see in the office. I mean hes a director managing a massive company, but he can’t manage his family. It shows zero boundaries and poor people skills which I believe is a huge red flag for our future marriage. 

Here’s where I screwed up. At that party, I asked to borrow his phone to book an uber pretending that mine was dead. I was crushing hard and wanted to see if he had any other girls so I snooped a bit and I checked his messages. No girls as such all the names were too formally saved but I saw messages from his sister and her husband thanking him for the new Porsche he gifted her husband. Yep, a fucking Porsche as a gift to the already filthy rich. There were also messages from his mother and the cousins but he came back quickly for his phone and I had to pretend I was browsing uber for options. But I assume he bought them wildly expensive gifts too. I felt lowkey jealous because they all were chilling while I had to share my flat with 2 other people. At that moment it hit me. His top priority is his overly clingy family. I felt awful for looking but I realised he’s carrying their weight for some reason. All of them are independently rich, tech savvy and highly educated. Why do they need him for gifts or venting or for running stupid errands ?  

I’m 24 and dreaming of a life with him in a big home with kids and financial stability. But if he’s bankrolling and babysitting his family then where do we fit? I’ve been nudging gently by asking like dont their calls ever wear you out? I’ll say it softly while cuddling making sure it sounds as concern. I’m just empowering him to be his own man. He pushes back with pointed questions like why does it bother me so much but I pivot to his work stress or how his family’s neediness drag him down and drain him emotionally. I even floated moving to the US, where he could build his amazing startups in Silicon Valley. I’ve always wanted to live abroad and I found an attorney through a friend that mentioned the investor visa. He has the money for it and I am okay with moving so I feel it will be a great step for our future and his sanity so why not ? 

But he’s getting testy now. Yesterday I hinted about his mom’s calls again, and he snapped. He yelled at me in the car and asked me why do I care so much. He said he will deal with this and doesnt need me to handle his family or feelings. He’s been distant since with shorter texts and no date nights. I try to dial up the romance, but I can feel him slipping. I’m not trying to cut him off from his family I just want boundaries so we can build something great together. He says that this is his family and they have helped him through rough patches so he feels loyal but this co-dependency is a dealbreaker. I’m not being ruthless I’m just protecting my heart. If he can’t see that his family’s reliance will sink our marriage before it starts then maybe he’s not the high-value man I thought he was. 

Do you guys think I am pushing him too much ? I want him to be at peace and I feel he wont get there unless he is pushed towards it. ",2,1761581500.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

Once upon a time, evenings meant ECR breezes and sunday cricket with friends. Now it’s office deadlines, online food delivery, and the occasional message that says “Let’s catch up soon” that never really happens. The city hasn’t changed entirely but the way we live in it has.

Still, Chennai has a strange kind of patience. It lets us rant, it lets us complain about the humidity, the traffic, the chaos and then, it surprises us with one sunset that makes everything feel right again. Or one cup of hot filter coffee that brings back all the warmth we thought we lost.

So maybe Chennai is still Chennaiying just in quieter, grown-up ways. Maybe the city hasn’t stopped being itself. Maybe we’re the ones learning how to see it differently now.",1,1761581475.0,chennaicity,0,1.0,False

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Mondays are usually the slowest day ever… but not today! The Halloween energy is everywhere — posters, spooky stickers on lockers, and even the loudspeaker played the Ghostbusters theme during morning announcements!

When I got to class, Carmen and Penny were already waiting by my desk.
Penny whispered excitedly, “Amy! Did you see the post? Michelle McBain shared a photo from the pumpkin farm — and you’re in the background!”
Carmen gasped, “You’re practically famous, Amy!”

I turned red and laughed. “No way! It was just a coincidence!”
Still, it was kinda cool — the photo had hundreds of likes already, and people were tagging it with #SpookyMansion and #PumpkinDreams.

At recess, Siu Ling and Monique came over from their class, and everyone sat together under the maple tree. Winfrey, of course, brought her new novel about that romantic barista again, but today she also showed us the reminder for Michelle’s show premiere this Friday.
“It says the first episode’s about haunted houses!” she said.
Penny shivered. “If I hear one creak in my house that night, I’m sleeping in the living room.”

We couldn’t stop laughing.

After school, we all decided to visit Coffee Day, since Zoe and her staff were busy decorating for the big Halloween Smoothie Charity Booth.
When we arrived, the café looked like a cozy pumpkin wonderland! Orange lights hung over the windows, fake cobwebs covered the menu board, and every table had a tiny carved pumpkin with a glowing tealight inside.

Zoe greeted us warmly. “Perfect timing, girls! Want to help with the last touches?”
Of course, we said yes.

Haruka was arranging the candy bowls, Ayaka was sticking pumpkin decals on the glass door, and Charlotte and Anastasia were testing the blender for the new Pumpkin Spice Smoothie Special. Even Mr. Tanaka was there, helping to move boxes of paper cups — he smiled and said, “Business gets extra busy during Halloween, but it’s always fun.”

We helped string up the final row of fairy lights outside, while Zoe handed out tiny pumpkin cookies she baked herself.
Then she announced, “This Friday, we’ll open the charity booth right next to the school gate — smoothies, cupcakes, and candies, all for a good cause!”

Winfrey clapped. “That’s so awesome! We’ll totally come support!”
And I told her, “Let’s all wear something spooky-cute!”

When I got home, Mom was already carving the pumpkins we bought yesterday. The whole house smelled like cinnamon and roasted pumpkin seeds.

As I wrote this, I realized something — Halloween isn’t just about the spooky stuff. It’s about everyone coming together — friends, family, and even the people we just met, like Michelle and Zoe.

This year’s going to be unforgettable.

Sometimes bad, but still hot. Okay, sometimes just warm. At least it’s free. (As long as you're making it.)

So, read the book. Check out the CliffsNotes. Watch the movie. Or just hang out and watch us blather. We're here for the pure enjoyment of books and literature in all its forms. No judgments. No right or wrong answers. Just some colorful discourse and a lively exchange of opinions. And coffee. (Did we mention coffee?)

I have promised the physician that has had the misfortune of having me as his patient, to remain calm, eat balanced proper meals, avoid caffeine and sugar filled beverages and avoid getting my blood pressure elevated.  This translates to drink water, no fast or frozen foods, no television and especially no news programs!!!  So, as I drink my morning cup of Community Dark and Bold Intense Blend coffee, Dark Roast of course with a touch of Hazelnut creamer just to take a bit of the edge off, I will share with you my confusion over the numbers just not adding up for me.  Our Republican leaders share with us that the ridiculous tariffs thrown out like rice at a cheap wedding, are bringing in trillions of dollars, that's right, trillions of dollars, but on the flip side our national debt has now reached 38 trillion dollars !!!  First off, can you prove that trillions of dollars are flooding in because of the tariffs, and if so, its obviously not being applied to the national debt, so where is all this money going, or should I ask into whose pocket is this money winding up in?? Now some of you morons actually believe this bullshit nonsense the Republicans are saying that you do not pay the tariffs, that is total bullshit, bullshit and more bullshit.   I will only go over this once for all the people who are unable to walk and chew gum at the same time, you the American citizen pay the tariffs plain and simple, no one else, just you.  For example, I run a business and I buy coffee for 3 dollars a bag, then I sell it to you the consumer for 6 dollars a bag.  That 3 dollar difference is my profit margin that allows me to stay in business, pay my expenses and make a small profit.   Now if my cost rises because the tariffs now make me pay 5 dollars a bag for the same coffee, you can be damn sure I am not still selling it to you for 6 dollars, you will be paying 8 dollars so my profit margin remains the same.  So the importer passes the cost over to the wholesaler, who passes it over to the retailer, who passes it on to the consumer ( you ), more crudely put when the crap ( Tariff ) hits the fan (retailer) guess who gets splattered, that's right, its you the consumer!!!  Talk about splattered pieces of crap, this criminal, thug mentality, abortion of black hooded clan members pretending to be law enforcement has got to be stopped!!  No one can call themselves a man, and rough up and manhandle minors and children!!  Any piece of shit that physically harms a minor or child will burn in hell, not a threat but a promise from God, you can read about it in a book called the Bible, or the Quran,  that is if you are able to process words greater than three letters in length.  If they damage your property, take them to court and sue, if they cause you any harm, take them to court and sue, video anything and everything. its not by chance that they are unmarked, unnamed, wear masks to hide their identity, this is all by design to make it as difficult as possible to hold them accountable for any wrongdoing.  ICE is just another gift from your elected Republican controlled government, another page right out of Hitlers playbook, they just dropped the  German SS nomenclature.  I am deeply saddened to see America in so much dysfunction and distress all for the sake of ego, lust for power, and fake Christian outrage.  Former Republican speaker of the house Paul Ryan was an honorable good christian man, of impeccable honesty and integrity, with a real passion for the government to do its job for the American people.  Rather than sell his soul to the devil, he chose to leave politics with his moral identity intact.  We desperately need to elect more honest decent men like him and stop electing egotistical wack jobs with private hidden agendas.  Our elected officials should have only one loyalty, and that loyalty is to the people that elected them into office, no one else, not even the party they belong to, the party did not vote them into office, the people did.!!!!! It all boils down to you, the voter, without your vote, they lose, so stop being a complete and total moron, stop electing two faced idiots, power hungry maniacs, drunkards, drug addicts, spineless ass kissing losers!!!!  Take the time to do your own research, ask your own questions, the internet is an amazing resource for information but also a tool for propaganda, so learn to tell the difference!!!!!  Democrats, Republicans, Independents by law and design are tasked to work together, compromise and work toward mutual benefit and prosperity for the betterment of the Nation as a Whole.  These elected assholes that are attempting to operate as a one party system are traitors and closet communists!!!  America has three separate yet equal divisions of government that right now is a complete and total disaster, an embarrassment and dishonor to all the men and women who lost their lives in our military defending the principles and laws that govern this nation.  There is good and bad in all political parties, and that is the fault of the American voter for doing such a shit job in electing decent representatives to serve in our government.  You elect trash to serve in our government, you get trash as your reward and the country does not prosper as a whole, and your life, your expenses, your freedoms pay the price for their failure!!!!!  So if your tired of shooting yourself in the foot, try your best to pay attention, read, do your own research, and start electing men and women who will serve the people, serve the nation with honor and distinction, not their good ole boy buddies or their own wallet or purse!!!  If you the voter keep fucking around and being stupid it won't take long for the con artists, the ego maniacs, the mentally unfit to drag this nation into economic disparity and ruin!!!!  My closing advice, my opinion, my thought I would share with Mike Johnson, put on your big boy pants, and earn your keep, do your job, the one that the American people elected you to do.  It is a disgrace that any of you are being paid to sit on you ass and fail to do your job, any other employer would fire your ass and kick you to the curb!!  Stop with the communist agenda, compromise and create with all the brilliant minds that surround you, and serve the American people, you know, the one's that voted you into office, and can just as easily replace you with someone who will do the job!!!!What is happening right now is not a game, real lives and people are being harmed, yet all you elected assholes collect your pay while you sit back and play your stupid childish games.  If I cant have it my way I will take my ball and go home so none of you will play, nanny nanny boo boo stick your head in doo doo !!!!  Can you at least try and act like a grown ass adult and do your job.  I am truly saddened  by this turn of events, I had such high hopes for Mike Johnson, I thought he would be the more stable voice of reason, I sincerely felt that he possessed the wisdom to unite the divisions and get things done, I clearly see that I was wrong, but as they say, fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice, shame on me!!!",1,1761581113.0,u_Maleficent_Jury_6620,0,1.0,False
1ohig1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TerpReviews/comments/1ohig1b/my_favorite_cdt_vendor/,My favorite CDT vendor,"I want to preface this by saying that I am not sponsored by this company at all, I've simply had wonderful experiences from the products I've gotten from them and I feel like they really deserve more attention.

VolatileOrganix (Formerly know as FatDogCBD) has some of the best if not highest quality CDT terpenes that I've tried. Period. Their terpene profiles in my experience are very authentic to the strain names. (So no guessing if you're really trying OG Kush Terpenes, Gelato Terpenes, Etc.) A little part of me selfishly wants to keep their company a so called ""guarded secret"" just so that I won't have to worry about their product running out as often but that's not great for their business. It's really that good! 🥴 They used to sell high quality hemp-derived terpenes back in ~2021 but they've since moved their market to cannabis derived terpenes, using a vacuum distilled method to preserve their strains terpene profiles in high detail while also being very cost effective. In fact, all of the flower they use is grown in house which makes the pricing even more flexible on their end! I've never had a single vial from them that tasted hayish/off and can't state enough how thankful I am for their hard work! Erich Berkovitz, you are an angel sent from the heavens. 🙏 The strains I have tried from them are as follows

OG Kush (Classic OG) - Very exotic cheese coffee gassy hash type of flavor that I can only describe as ""kushy"". Distinctly unique flavor.

Gelato - Has a over arching rainbow sherbet sort of smell that's engulfed in a heavy jalapeno/bell pepper gassy taste. (This is the freshest harvest in their lineup)

Cookies - Carries that OG Kush funk mixed with a complex baked good sweet sort of flavor.

Pink Pineapple - Has a pineapple citrus tang coupled with chocolaty overtones.

(Out of Stock) Orange Diesel - Has an interesting ""oily"" sort of smell to it coupled by strong diesel and tangerines.

Lemon Kush - Very lemony forward with earthy backend notes that gives it a sappy sort of quality. It also has a slight train diesel scent.

Key Lime Pie - Authentic to the name, tastes insanely close to a key lime desert.

(Pre-Release Free Sample) Green Crack - Mango forward flavor coupled by a tropical clove flavor.

(Pre-Release Free Sample) Jack Herer - Complex refreshing earthy scent that reminds me of grass and lemon tea.

(Pre-Release Free Sample) Motor Breath - Has an earthy and similar sort of ""oily"" smell with that the Orange Diesel had, though the smell on this one is not at all what was expecting. Unfortunately has little to no gassy/diesel flavor and appears muted over all. (My least favorite)

(Pre-Release Free Sample) Snow Lotus - Very unique earthy flavor coupled by a STRONG cat piss funk, to the point it smells moldy and microbial. 😂 It's like your walking into a pine forest after a light moist rain of piss from cats above. 💀

(Pre-Release Free Sample) Marshmallow Z - Has a notable creamy/sweet/airy sort of taste coupled by a rainbow sherbet.

Though I did not write them down, the expected effects for each of the strains also delivers. For example, green crack/jack herer are super heady sativas with mind expanding/stimulating qualities when compared to the indica leaning ones like snow lotus/og kush.

The best part about this is that you get these insanely high quality terpenes at such a reasonable price. It's honestly mind blowing. As of right now, they're selling a ""2024/25 CDT Sample Pack"" that has 1ml of 6 of their different strains + 1ml of a pre-release strain for $70. 👀 You're getting SUPER high quality terpenes for $10 a pop with that pack. 😵‍💫 Would love to hear any of your own personal experiences with the company if you have tried them.

I'm going under the machine recommended amount of coffee at 19 grams and under what I've seen as the standard 18 grams. I'm all the way down to 16 grams and its still too much coffee.

1ohid0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_trading/comments/1ohid0c/two_months_daily_signals_and_a_lot_of_charts_real/,"Two Months, Daily Signals, and a Lot of Charts - Real Experience","# A Simple Start to Smarter Trading

When I first ventured into stock trading, the sheer volume of market data and the complexity of technical indicators felt overwhelming. I spent hours analyzing charts, second-guessing my decisions, and often missing opportunities because I couldn’t process information fast enough. Then I discovered a tool that delivers [daily buy, sell, and hold recommendations](https://tickeron.com/app/home/?homePageMode=trader), and it completely changed how I approached trading. The simplicity of receiving clear, actionable signals each morning allowed me to focus on making decisions rather than drowning in data.

Setting up the signals was incredibly straightforward. From the homepage of the platform, I clicked on a bell icon next to my watchlist, and a small window popped up, letting me choose the type of alerts I wanted — [buy, sell, or hold](https://tickeron.com/app/home/?homePageMode=trader). With just a couple of clicks, I had customized notifications set to arrive directly to my email or a dedicated notifications page. The process was so intuitive that I had my first signals set up within minutes, even as a beginner. Whether I was browsing my watchlist or exploring specific stocks, the option to “Set up signals” was always just a click away, making it easy to tailor the tool to my needs.

# Clear Signals, Delivered Daily

Each day after the markets closed, I received fresh recommendations based on the latest price movements and market conditions. The system processes a massive amount of data overnight — price action, volume, and other factors — and translates it into concise signals that are easy to understand. For example, I’d get a notification saying “Buy” for a specific stock, complete with a confidence score that showed the likelihood of success based on historical patterns. This clarity helped me act quickly without needing to second-guess the analysis.

What stood out was how the signals didn’t just tell me what to do — they gave me context. Each [recommendation ](https://tickeron.com/app/home/?homePageMode=trader)came with details like suggested entry points, stop-loss levels, and even position sizing ideas. For instance, when I received a buy signal for a tech stock, the accompanying information explained that the signal was based on a bullish flag pattern with strong volume confirmation. This transparency made it easier for me to trust the recommendations and understand the reasoning behind them, which was especially helpful as I was still learning the ropes of technical analysis.

# Tailoring Signals to Fit My Style

One of the best parts of using this tool was how customizable it was. I could filter signals based on my preferences, like focusing only on stocks with high trading volume or specific market caps. As a swing trader, I set the platform to prioritize multi-day signals, but I could easily switch to intraday signals if I wanted to experiment with day trading. The ability to adjust risk settings was a game-changer — I could opt for conservative signals with tighter stop-losses or take a chance on higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. The platform adapted to my choices, ensuring I only saw signals that matched my trading goals.

The interface also learned from my behavior over time. As I interacted with the signals, clicking on ones that aligned with my strategy, the platform started prioritizing similar opportunities. For someone like me, who didn’t have hours to spend analyzing markets, this personalization made trading feel manageable and tailored to my needs. I could even choose how much detail I wanted with each signal — detailed explanations for when I was in learning mode or just the essentials when I was ready to act.

# Acting on Signals with Confidence

The real-time delivery of signals was a lifesaver. Each morning, I’d wake up to a fresh batch of recommendations, neatly organized in a feed that highlighted the most promising opportunities. The visual layout was clean, with color-coded tiles showing the ticker, [signal type](https://tickeron.com/app/home/?homePageMode=trader), and confidence score at a glance. If I wanted to dive deeper, a single click revealed the full analysis, including the technical patterns or fundamental factors driving the signal. This balance of simplicity and depth made it easy to act quickly, whether I was trading from my phone during a coffee break or sitting at my desk.

The notifications were equally convenient. I set up alerts to arrive via email, but I could also check them on the platform’s “My Notifications” page. If a signal changed — like a stock moving from “Hold” to “Sell” due to a sudden price shift — I’d get an instant update. This responsiveness kept me on top of market movements without needing to monitor charts all day. For someone with a busy schedule, this was a huge relief, as I could trade effectively without being glued to a screen.

# Managing Risk Made Simple

Risk management was another area where the tool shone. Every signal came with built-in stop-loss and position sizing [recommendations](https://tickeron.com/app/home/?homePageMode=trader), which took the guesswork out of protecting my capital. For example, when I followed a buy signal for a stock in a bullish trend, the suggested stop-loss was based on recent volatility and support levels, not just a random percentage. This gave me confidence that I wasn’t overexposing myself to risk. The position sizing suggestions also helped me allocate my capital sensibly, ensuring I didn’t bet too much on a single trade.

The platform’s ability to adjust risk parameters based on market conditions was a pleasant surprise. During volatile periods, it automatically suggested wider stop-losses and smaller position sizes, which helped me avoid unnecessary losses. This dynamic approach felt like having a seasoned trader guiding me, making it easier to stay disciplined and avoid emotional decisions.

# Tracking Performance and Building Trust

One of the most reassuring aspects was the transparency in tracking performance. Each signal came with an “Odds of Success” score, which showed the historical success rate of similar setups. For instance, a signal with a 70% success rate gave me a clear sense of its reliability, helping me decide how much to invest. The platform also provided detailed metrics like win rates and average gains, so I could see how signals performed over time. This data-driven approach built my trust in the system, as I could see real results rather than relying on vague promises.

Over time, I noticed that the signals were consistently delivered. For example, a head and shoulders pattern signal led to a quick 5% gain in just a few days, while a momentum signal on another stock captured a 10% move over two weeks. The ability to review past performance helped me refine my strategy, focusing on the types of signals that worked best for me. It was like having a personal trading journal that updated itself automatically.

# Affordable and Accessible for All

What surprised me most was how affordable this powerful tool was. For just $60 a year — thanks to a promotional offer I found — it provided access to professional-grade analytics that rivaled what institutional traders use. This low cost made it accessible even for someone like me, who was just starting out with a modest trading account. The combination of ease of use, robust analytics, and an affordable price made it feel like a no-brainer to continue using the tool.

# Summary

[Daily Buy/Sell Signals](https://tickeron.com/app/home/?homePageMode=trader) have been a game-changer for my trading journey. The platform’s commitment to making high-quality analytics accessible through artificial intelligence is evident in every aspect of its design. By processing vast amounts of market data quickly and efficiently, Tickeron delivers clear, actionable insights that simplify trading without sacrificing depth.

1ohibt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1ohibt6/my_girlfriend_dumped_me_after_my_autism_diagnosis/,My girlfriend dumped me after my autism diagnosis,"I apologize in advance because this is going to be a bit of a long story, and I'm grateful to anyone who has the patience to follow through.

We'd been together for four and a half years, our relationship was peaceful, and I thought we'd eventually get married. Honestly, the only reason we weren't married yet was because of me, because I wanted to be as secure as possible before formalizing things with her. But I saw her as a lifelong partner and imagined us growing old together. I think things started to get worse when I started seeking psychological evaluation due to the suspected autism.

We've always been very different when it comes to our energy levels for socializing. At first, I forced myself to accompany her to every event, party, family gathering, whatever, because she insisted on me being there. Gradually, I felt more comfortable expressing how exhausting these social situations were for me, how they triggered feelings of inadequacy and the need for isolation for many days afterward to recover. It took time, but she understood that this was how it would be. So I started being present in these situations whenever necessary, like her birthday, graduation, and other similar events. And she understood that this wasn't just a ""preference"" of mine, but rather something that preserved my health, preventing me from having meltdowns. I thought we had reached a perfect alignment because I was able to set my own limits and have them respected, without the relationship having to suffer.

At the end of last year, I had my first neuropsychological evaluation and was diagnosed with ADHD, and since then I've been living in a mental hell. I always suspected I was autistic, and when I sought the evaluation, I expected to receive this diagnosis. When the result was ADHD, I was frustrated and processing the information for a while. So I sought treatment with a psychiatrist and told her I wasn't comfortable with the diagnosis, that I felt I hadn't been properly evaluated, and asked if she could re-evaluate me. She agreed that the diagnosis might have been wrong, especially given the difficulty diagnosing autism in women. Today, I'm 33 years old, and my entire life has been marked by periods of depression and hopelessness, feeling powerless, as if I were an alien living in a world that wasn't meant for me. This psychiatrist, whom I've been seeing for nine months now, observed and evaluated me for eight months, treating my ADHD and depression. Finally, last month, she told me, ""I have enough evidence to confirm that you are autistic."" This was one of the most liberating moments of my life, and I thought my life would improve significantly from then on, because now I would understand myself better and could communicate my needs and difficulties based on scientific evidence, and not just my ""guesses"" (read: almost a doctoral thesis on my own traits, behaviors, health history, and everything else).

As I said, I had been in a relationship with this person for four and a half years. Earlier this year, she moved in with me at a somewhat turbulent time because I didn't feel safe sharing my space with another person. I'm very systematic and have a strong need for isolation. I thought very rationally about the problems this could cause for our relationship. But she was dissatisfied and basically gave me an ultimatum, and I decided to give it a try. From the beginning, I made it very clear to her how insecure I was about it, and I accepted it as a vote of confidence in our relationship, thinking that perhaps, in the future, things could work out.

But from the beginning, everything was chaos. I went through absurd crises because my entire environment changed overnight. Suddenly, among my things, there were other things that didn't belong. I was deeply irritated by everything because she doesn't follow the same logic of organization as I do—in fact, she doesn't follow any organization at all; she's a very messy person—and these things related to the control structure that kept me regulated were slowly tearing me down.

However, she always interpreted this as a rejection of her, and she couldn't understand my personal struggle as a neurodivergent person that all those changes to my routines, spaces, and safety structures were causing in me.

When she came to my apartment, I had been living with my sister for over seven years, and despite our differences, I was completely used to sharing the space with her. Especially since she also isolates herself and lives a practically separate life within the same house, and there was no pressure whatsoever to coexist or align expectations about what each of us should do there. So, when I asked my sister to leave so she could come live with me, I faced great grief because I was very attached to her, and it had always been a safe environment for me, having her living under the same roof. My girlfriend was insensitive to me when I showed her I was grieving the separation from my sister, and said I should be happy that she would stay with me, not the other way around. She labels some of my standards as childish.

Well, I'm a very rational person; I knew how difficult it would be to fit all her things into my small apartment and to bring our cats together (she has two males and I have two females). I anticipated chaos would ensue, and it did. The first hurdle was finding space for everything she brought. We had to throw out many things, both mine and hers, to achieve a suitable collection of things that wouldn't leave the house feeling like a warehouse. This process took a week, and it was one of the hardest things of my life. Looking at my completely messy, unrecognizable house, full of boxes and randomly arranged things, and not being able to organize, simply because it was no longer possible – not until all the boxes and suitcases were emptied and everything was put away. The second obstacle was introducing her cats. My two kittens are very territorial, and according to their veterinarian, it's more difficult for females to accept male cats into their groups. So we had to keep them separate for over a month, and during that time, she slept with them in my sister's old room, with litter boxes, food bowls, and an old mattress. It was unhealthy to go through that. But I confess it was a relief for me to be able to sleep alone for the first few days, while the adjustment was still in its very early stages. It was the time of day when I could breathe and regulate myself, free from the discomfort of being perceived. Even after two months, my kittens showed no signs of accepting her cats, and we were in a delicate situation. She was depressed about sleeping in a separate room, smelling of litter box and piled high with things, while I was in charge of the rest of the house. So I offered her that we start taking turns. Each day, one of us would sleep in the room with the cats. But one of her cats meowed a lot; he was very stressed from being locked in. So he would stop in front of the door and meow, in a desperate way that seemed like it would never end. One of the days I was going to sleep in the room with them, I was extremely exhausted, I lay down on the mattress on the floor and just wanted to sleep. The cat started meowing incessantly, and I had a horrible meltdown, sobbing. When she heard me crying, she came to the room and told us to switch, that she would sleep there. I felt so bad, a person incapable of coping with difficult situations. I feel like a disappointment when these things happen.

But after a while, we decided to let them go and try to manage the fights with my cats, at least when we were home. And little by little, the feline situation became less critical. We went back to sleeping together, and our routines began to normalize.

At that moment, I began to realize that I was adapting to this new reality. I began to recognize my apartment again and no longer get irritated by her things. We had a lot of conflicts regarding household chores, and I had to explain some of my demands to her, like how I like the pillows placed on the bed, how I like the clothes hung and folded, and honestly, she always saw these things as petty. Fortunately, I'm in therapy, and my psychologist helped me a lot in dealing with these conflicts, trying to make it very clear to her that it wasn't a problem with her, but rather a pattern of my functioning that allows me to stay in control.

And during that time, I was seeking confirmation of my diagnosis with the psychiatrist. It was a very distressing period because the uncertainty about who I was made me very insecure about asserting my differences and my needs. I was in limbo for almost that entire year, and she knows how much I was suffering from it. When I received the diagnosis last month, she not only showed no interest, but also didn't say anything to me, didn't ask me how I was doing, if I needed to say anything, or anything.

This coincided with a time when she was leaving the house alone a lot every weekend, and I began to feel abandoned and sad, because even though I didn't want to spend the whole day away from home, I still wanted to go out for coffee, lunch, or a walk in the park with her. I began spending weekends alone at home, paralyzed, unable to do anything but rot, and I fell into a very severe depression. When I told her how I was feeling, she lashed out, saying I never suggested anything for us to do, so she was doing her own thing because she couldn't wait for me. Although I felt very upset about this, it felt like it was a situation I had caused myself, due to my unwillingness to leave the house... and because I felt somewhat guilty, I couldn't argue with her.

Even with this situation, I really enjoyed sharing my life with her. I created a comfort around what we had built here: the routines, having breakfast together, each of us going to work, texting when we got home that I was bringing bread, binge-watching series at night, talking. For me, this was more than I could have imagined. I never thought I would one day be able to share a house with someone and feel comfortable with it, being able to isolate myself when I didn't want company and still be okay. And just when I thought we were at the best point in our relationship, because we'd overcome those first terrible months and everything was calm, she comes to me one Saturday morning and says: I want to break up.

My world fell apart with those words. I must have been incredibly stupid not to have realized she was heading in the opposite direction, that she hadn't been with me for a while, ever since she started leaving the house every weekend and wouldn't even ask if I wanted to do anything. When she ignored me at a crucial moment in my life, when I received the diagnosis that explains my entire existence and will allow me to live a lighter life, without putting so much pressure on myself. The truth is, she was never interested in who I was. Every time I tried to share something about autism with her, she was hostile, saying it wouldn't change who I was overnight, or that I shouldn't use those things to justify anything. But I never tried to do that; I was just naturally learning about myself and trying to apply the right words to describe situations I couldn't explain before. And she dismissed that. That's what hurts me the most. I feel abandoned for being who I am, for being autistic, for having sought to understand myself and improve.

When she broke up with me three days ago, I told her it was the cruelest thing in the world to give up this relationship at my lowest point, knowing the hell I've been living through for the past month: the identity crisis, the feeling of being lost, of having no support to get through this, of being depressed and burned out after more than a year of searching for an answer, and when I find one, my partner rejects me, leaves me. She says it's because I haven't shown my love for her in a long time, that she'd like more displays of affection, that I don't participate in her life, that I'm not interested in her affairs, and that she's been unhappy for a long time and can't take it anymore. Ok, so basically she doesn't understand my love language, because I love her too much, and my way of showing it is through acts of service, through quality time. Of course, these are simple things I do, especially because lately I don't have much to give even for myself, but seeing that she doesn't see my effort to show my love in my own way makes me feel invalidated and misunderstood. For example, when she went on a trip, I took her bike for repairs, washed her clothes, and left them neatly folded and organized in the closet. I handle every possible bureaucratic issue in our lives, schedule doctor appointments for her, help her remember things. This is my way of showing my love. In fact, I've recently been looking for a bigger bed to buy so we can sleep more comfortably, because sleeping with four cats is quite challenging and sometimes doesn't allow us to truly rest. I was even looking at rings to buy as a surprise, because I was starting to feel more confident about committing. And then all this happens?

We've had many difficult times, but somehow it always seemed like, no matter what, we could overcome it and stay together, because we love each other. Why, right now, does it feel like there's no room to even talk and try to get through this again? That's why I think it's my diagnosis. That she never wanted me to be autistic, and she always rejected my characteristics. Maybe it's too much for her to deal with, to commit to an autistic person, now that she knows I am. My friend, who also has ADHD, told me that she doesn't see me as neurodivergent, and that's why she can't understand me. I guess that makes sense.

She once told me that I'd been regressing a lot since I started seeking a diagnosis, that I was leaving the house less and less, that I had less capacity to endure uncomfortable situations, that I was more likely to experience crises. And I told her that this was a normal process, because I'm reevaluating my existence and trying to stop masking, and I've been doing this even before the diagnosis was confirmed, because deep down I already knew the answer. And it feels lighter to just be who you are without having to force it, act, pretend.

I know it's not right to infer that she left me because of my diagnosis, but it's inevitable to think that it was a factor in her decision. I'm feeling insufficient and disposable. It feels like the worst feeling in the world, and one that will never go away. She forced me to live with her, and now that I've gotten used to it, I'm forced to relive a traumatic move all over again. She went to her parents' house with a few suitcases, but I still don't know when the final move will happen. When she'll come here and take everything away. And all this uncertainty leaves me stagnant. It feels like I won't be able to live through the next few days. I have no idea how to get through this.

""… why have you brought me here to this cafe?"" The minotaur looked around at all of the unaware mortals in the cafe, clearly somewhat confused.

Sage just smiled. ""Before we head back to camp through a portal, I wanted a little chat. You can never get any peace around our war camps, even if they aren't actively being raided by a goddess and her little campers.""

* * *

_An hour ago…_

Sage sipped on a to-go cup of coffee she had gotten earlier, her other hand holding an umbrella. As long as she drank caffeine in moderation, it worked wonders for her Legendary Cognition. There weren't many ways to improve something that was already 'legendary,' but some caffeine could help her fetch memories faster. If the creation of Athena was like a machine, then caffeine helped her overclock her mind. Her cognition only went so far due to mortal limits; some things came in, and some things went, though sometimes the things that went would come back to her in certain situations.

But now, back to what she was currently doing. She currently had pictures of various monster tracks in her mind, but she specifically had one set of tracks in mind:

Minotaur tracks.

Sage had no luck in Oklahoma City proper, so it only stood to reason that Karkhros the Younger would be somewhere more remote, such as the forest Sage was in, if he was no longer in the Labyrinth. After all, the rumors in the job Karkhros the Senior had put up said that he had allegedly been spotted in Oklahoma City, so the younger minotaur would likely not dare to venture the labyrinth once more.

""It's 60 degrees Fahrenheit and also rainy. Wonderful weather."" Sage spoke to herself sarcastically, dropping her smile. She was thankful that she chose to wear her pink hoodie under her Atlas robes and bring an umbrella along.

""I'll just have to find him quickly then so that I don't get sick from this weather."" The Champion of Atlas quickened her pace, venturing deeper into the forest.

Her eyes analyzed the area around her. _As good as this place could be for a war camp, Karkhros the Younger's presence has already potentially been noticed. We shan't waste time with this place. There will not be another New London._

Sage then looked at the ground, her smile returning.

Minotaur tracks.

""There you are,"" she said to herself, as she quickly began to follow the trail.

* * *

_Present Time…_

""It's good that you were not intercepted by anyone sided with Olympus. They probably would have put out a job for some campers to go and kill you, or something."" Sage laughed at the thought of it.

Karkhros also snorted. ""Indeed. It is unfortunate that my days in the Labyrinth ended up being a few months in the outside world, but no matter. What is done is done. The cause will continue.""

The creation of Athena nodded. ""Of course. Nothing can stop it now."" She perked up, remembering something. ""Say, now that I have found you, I believe you could help me tie another loose end. Do you know what might have happened to Naomi? I gave a report of many recent events to our commander, but all I could say for her was that she was missing.""

The minotaur solemnly nodded. ""The keeper had a failsafe. I presume she used it. If that was the case, then all you must know is that she sacrificed herself for the cause. Any other details are irrelevant.""

Sage closed her big grey eyes, before nodding along. ""For the cause.""

* * *

_Less than an hour ago…_

Karkhros the Younger walked through the forest, his hoofsteps shaking the earth and scaring any nature spirits within into hiding.

The minotaur was displeased. Looking at the human city nearby, it seemed that months had passed since his fateful encounter with Ariadne. There were still bruises on his body from the tight squeeze of the goddess's yarn, an absolute embarrassment. They would not scar, but that was no better.

Perhaps, with how much time had passed since New London, Atlas too had passed him by. Perhaps even his father had passed him by.

It was not long after those thoughts that Karkhros heard the sound of something walking through the forest. No. Someone. It wasn't just an animal or a nature spirit.

He smelt it: demi-god. Preparing for the potential of a fight, he was pleasantly surprised to see the robes of Atlas' army on the demi-god.

""Karkhros the Younger,"" The girl spoke, ""though months have passed, your reemergence from the Labyrinth has impeccable timing. Camp Fish-Blood is under siege, and Atlantis will soon be struck as well. While Camp Half-Blood and any other eyes are averted, I shall return you to camp, as per your father's request.""

The minotaur snorted. ""Very well. Who are you, Champion of Atlas?""

The girl smiled. ""Sage Valentine, Champion of Truth.""

* * *

""Back there, you called yourself the Champion of Truth. May I ask what you meant by that?"" Karkhros the Younger asked, clearly curious.

Sage nodded. ""Unlike some of our more recent additions, I did not join this cause purely out of spite towards my creator, the goddess of intelligence."" She avoided saying Athena's name, knowing well that the names of gods held power.

""She may be content with secreting away true knowledge from humanity, but I am not."" The creation of Athena looked around at the people in the cafe around her. ""I could make everyone in this cafe see you, see the truth, but it would be more trouble than it is worth. My power is only temporary, and they would go right back to burying the truth in their minds, thanks to the machinations of the gods.""

She wore a sinister, closed mouth smile for a moment before continuing. ""But Atlas. He is mighty. When he wins, when He takes his rightful place as King of the Universe, He will be the one in control. He can tear that dreaded Mist asunder, showing humanity the truth of the world that the Olympians wanted to hide.""

""_That_ is my core reason for being devoted to this cause. Camp Half-Blood fights for the status quo, achieving nothing. We fight for a whole new world."" Sage finished, her expression now having a gentler and more genuine smile.

Karkhros was stunned for a few seconds, before responding. ""I see… Your desire is commendable. Perhaps the new world will come one day soon.""

""But for now, perhaps it is time to return to one of the war camps. What time did you arrange for a portal to come and pick us up?""

""6 PM, but the particular portal keeper I met with makes me think it may be another half hour before a portal appears.""

The minotaur snorted. ""Very well. We will just have to wait a while then.""

""… I suppose we may as well have a little more conversation. Valentine. How did you end up joining our cause?""

* * *

_Over a year ago…_ [_(MUSIC)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ5WnrSNHIg)

_""Sage, you can't always call random people monsters. We raised you better than that.""_

_""Come on mom, why don't you see it!? I'm telling the truth!""_

_My dad spoke next. ""Kiddo, that's- oh shit, that is a monster.""_

_Mom whipped her head around, looking again. ""Don't encourage her, also, you really shouldn't be using that kind of language around- what the fuck!?""_

* * *

_""So you're telling me that our daughter,"" dad motioned to me, ""is actually descended from a Greek goddess and has been endangered by monsters this whole time?""_

_Mom nervously nodded. ""I think so. I don't remember everything that Athena told me. I lied to myself, told myself that it was all a dream. That me having a little girl on my doorstep was a miracle and nothing more. I tried to pretend the shield didn't exist, that I wouldn't have to give it to Sage.""_

_""Dammit Amelia! This isn't something to hide from us. Our daughter's life is in danger! She sees monsters all the time, but what if they decide to go after her?""_

_""You wouldn't have believed me. The only reason we're having this conversation is because Sage- Sage?""_

_I ran away._

* * *

[(MUSIC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P89rxnT7lKw)

_I don't know why I ran. It was just a sudden feeling. But perhaps it was fate._

_Because he found me. A son of Hermes, I think. I never got his name._

_""You're out late, kid. And you look sad. What's the matter?"" He asked me._

_I looked up at him. ""I ran from home. I didn't mean to, I- you wouldn't believe why I did.""_

_But he knew. Maybe it was my eyes. ""You're a demi-god like myself, aren't you?""_

_We talked for a while. He told me everything I needed to know._

_""What? That's horrible! The gods… they really do that?""_

_""Indeed. I, along with many others, fight to end this injustice. Would you like an opportunity to do so as well?""_

_""… yes. This madness… this Mist… it has to be stopped, right? Can I at least see the camp?""_

_""…sure, kid. You might fit right in.""_

_I never did see him again after he took me to the war camp. Sometimes I wonder if he died or got captured at some point._

_Sometimes I miss home. But I'm glad I ran away._

_Anything for the cause._

_Anything._

* * *

Instead of saying anything, even as all of the memories came flooding back, Sage just smiled.

""It doesn't really matter. But I can say this. Camp Half-Blood calls themselves heroes. But, in my opinion, if their standard of being a hero is similar to that of the standard for Ancient Greek heroes, then I feel content with being a villain instead.""

She then stood up. ""Well, guess it's time to get going to the meeting point.""

Karkhros nodded. ""Yes. Let us go.""

* * *

There is not much to be said about their walk to the rendezvous point. It was silent, given their conversation in the cafe. Sage had the way back to the area memorized; she may not have the navigation abilities of other demi-gods, but she could certainly memorize a way back somewhere.

By the time they made it to the area, a portal opened. Karkhros snorted when Sage spoke. ""Told you it was gonna be late.""

Without another word, the two stepped into the portal.

Another job completed.

This guy very convincingly became one of my closest confidants and I trusted him for two years now. 

He knows my wife has struggled with PTSD and depression stemming from being molested as a child by her father and for whatever reason this dude has been telling my wife, and her friends, her sister and my ex-wife that I am in a sexual relationship with my daughter (daughter with ex-wife, daughter lives with me).

This culminated with a visit from CPS after my wife shared her panic with her therapist, a mandated reporter. The investigation of course was closed once they interviewed my daughter and found that she was completely well adjusted and not being abused.

We are starting marriage counseling this week to work on repairing our relationship and she is working with her personal therapist to finally process the trauma of her childhood and get to the bottom of why she tolerated this dude's blatant manipulation. 

We would take this guy on vacations with us, I'd pay for everything. He would secretly ask my wife for hundreds of dollars and threaten suicide if she didn't give it to him. He once threatened to kill himself if I didn't buy him a cat. (That should have been the last straw, but I genuinely felt bad for him, still didn't buy him the fucking cat though). He'd ask my wife to go get coffee with her, then order TWO meals, and ask her to pay after the fact.  

He'd ask me to stay at our house multiple times a month for days at a time. He'd beg me to drive him to the airport at the crack of dawn because he couldn't afford an Uber and didn't want his parents to know he was going away. I thought I was being a good friend. This dude had unprecedented access to our lives. I would go to him for advice on my relationship and asking for his opinion. He was so convincing that he cared about me and my marriage that I actually trusted this disgusting piece of shit. 

Bro is 34 and goes to Disney World ALONE 6-7 times a year. 

He lives with his parents and is studying to be a social worker. I pray for his future patients. 

His parents don't know he's gay. (But honestly, they have to SUSPECT it. He's very gay) 

His parents are orthodox religious and his father is very anti-gay. 

I would have to correct him multiple times about using sexual language around our younger kids. He was absolutely filthy when he'd see a man walk by that he was attracted to. And I'd have to tell him ""you can't say shit like that in front of the kids"" 

He's a huge coward too. One such incident, he was high as hell on gummies and started insinuating that I was insulting him. He did this in front of my wife and kids. So I simply stood up and said ""Let's step outside. Let's have a talk, man to man"" 

He PANICKED. ""Help me! He's going to kill me! Help \[wife's name\]!"" 

Anyway long story short... I can't let this prick get away with what he did to me and our family.

He was always happy and rarely cried. Etas well, doesn’t sleep great but is a very happy boy. Except for the car. Hates it. Anytime he’s in the car he scream cries in a very visceral way that I find extremely stressful. When I’m with my husband I sit in the back with him and it’s still a challenge. But when I’m alone, it’s 10 times worse.
We changed car seats, bring toys, play music he likes, nothing helps. He stops crying the second the car stops and gets super happy when he sees us go round to get him out of the car seat. 
As a result, I avoid leaving the house like the plague. Which makes for a very isolating experience. I’m someone who loves going shopping or for coffee but I spend all day at home because taking him out takes everything out of me. By the time I reach the destination, I’m beyond frustrated and it’s not worth it in my mind. I’m growing resentful of how I’m spending these days.

I've always loved puzzles growing up, so I decided to build my own game, [www.coffeebreakgames.ca](http://www.coffeebreakgames.ca). It's a word puzzle inspired by the classic Knight’s Tour chess problem, but with a twist. You move across the board in L-shaped knight moves, selecting letters to form words that match the theme. There’s only one correct solution, since every word must fit perfectly on the grid using the same movement rules.

It updates daily, and I designed it to feel simple and intuitive, like Wordle. As the website's name suggests, it could be good to play during your coffee break!

Since it I made up my mind yesterday to burn my sketchbook, a doctor named Mephistopheles called me on a cell phone with no signal.

""Your work is amazing. It would be a shame to burn it. Or... could I trade you for more chicken?"" he tempted me, though the offer was truly tempting.

I was very skeptical of this offer; after all, the Federation often warns us about scams. But when he showed me his ID and visited me, I was convinced it was the real deal.

""Your sister's wish is actually for you to cooperate with us."" The man sitting across from me glanced at the sketchbook on the table and took a sip of coffee.

""Yes, my dear brother, you must listen to what the gentleman in front of you says."" My sister's voice echoed in my mind.

""You possess a remarkable creative ability, the ability to transform your thoughts into real weapons."" He paused, then continued, ""Among the Corrupted, you belong to a new breed, capable of transforming thoughts into reality, including your sister.""

What... what? Did I create your sister?

""Yes,"" he smiled.

""Not only did you create your sister, you also created a small part of the Fog City experiment. Hahaha..."" His voice echoed through the valley, each word resonating like thunderbolts through my mind.

Hearing these words, I felt my head spin, my heart shattering. Past memories pierced my subconscious like the wound of Damocles, and the scene before me was like a mirage, an illusion that burst like a bubble...

Yes... I'm not actually fat, nor am I a sketching enthusiast. The memories of my sister and my life, the hunger I felt, were just illusions amplified by my imagination after being kidnapped.

The real me, after taking a series of dopamine-inducing drugs prescribed by the doctor, was wheeled into the operating room, completely limp. I watched as the surgeons cut open my skull. The remaining protein was connected to various tubes to read my memory, allowing the machine to create a testbed. Those online posts were just development logs.

""I... I'm not a patient. I just... just..."" At this moment, I couldn't help but feel a wave of grief.

""What a miserable life..."" Mephistopheles offered a feigned sympathy, like a cat crying over a mouse.

""But if it weren't for this tangible pain, the toy wouldn't be real enough, wouldn't be fun enough."" As he spoke, he couldn't help but smile, a chilling smile. At the same time, I sensed a venomous, anti-human malice in him, colder than absolute zero and deeper than the Mariana Trench. I felt that this Mephistopheles guy was just a monster in human skin.

Just then, a middle-aged man in a suit walked in and asked, ""What are the results of the brain development?""

""Your Excellency, Subject Zero's brain is exceptionally developed. I believe the day of opening the door to truth won't be far off."" The researcher respectfully handed over the report.

He said nothing. After accepting the report, he simply turned up the lights, so bright that I couldn't even see his shadow. Under the illumination of the various lab facilities, his face could be described as nothing short of demonic. Just then, another researcher walked in, wheeling in some parts, and said to the Führer, ""Your Excellency, we've also prepared various human body parts.""

Ahhh...isn't this my favorite chicken drumstick? Amidst the endless sadness, I finally felt a glimmer of satisfaction...

This would be my first coffee machine, and my main goal is to make a good cappuccino — I’m not particularly interested in strong espressos.

From what I’ve read, users who have owned both the De’Longhi and the Philips often say they ended up keeping the De’Longhi. The common reason seems to be that the Philips (specifically the Philips 2300) tends to produce watery coffee.

I’m wondering: is this due to the break-in period, user error, or is the De’Longhi simply a better machine in the same price range?

I’m not an expert, but from an engineering perspective, I’m curious — what could explain such a noticeable difference between two machines that appear to have similar specs? Or is the difference possibly exaggerated?",1,1761580131.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Been in AA off and on throughout that time but never felt like I “needed” it. Recently have been back consistently to womens only groups so that I can hopefully help someone else, be an example, do service work etc.

Anyway this isn’t why I’m here. Lately I’ve been fixated on this feeling that life now, has no magic and no mystery. Through my alcoholic lens I cant tell if it’s because my drinking caused alcoholic euphoria and made everything seem more exciting and interesting than it actually was or if I’m just getting “older” and life is becoming redundant. 

When I used to go out in my early 20s even just to a coffee shop or pub on a date or with a friend, it all felt so cool and exciting. It’s hard to explain, like seeing and being seen. Like I didn’t know what was going to happen next in my story, there was mystery…

Now I’m 31 and I know how the story goes, I pick up on the foreshadowing and really, nothing that exciting is coming down the pipeline. Even novel experiences seem dull, compared to when I was drinking, the most mundane tasks seemed exciting with a drink in my hand. I could do the same thing again and again and never get bored of it, now 7 years later I feel like I’m surprised by nothing. 

Is this growing up? Or is this part of being sober? 
Ive moved, bought and sold property, gotten married, I hunt and fish, I learn new crafts all the time. 
I am happy, I just miss that feeling that something exciting is coming around the corner, not enough to drink to find out, I’m just curious if others can relate?

The sponsorships are more than ever. The show is popular and pulls in as many viewers or more than Survivor and Masterchef which have 250k-500k grand prizes. Yet the only guaranteed compensation to contestants from the show has been 100k for one pair since inception in 2003. They have continued to cheap out on the prize because they've become dependent on the home buyer covering it. 

Contestants are living on location for 3+ months, in a construction site, in a trailer, subsisting on microwave meals, coffee and McDs, working long hours, on camera almost 24/7 and under tremendous mental strain. They have no say on the sell price, the reserve price or the location and type of build, yet must build a home that production will sell to ensure a profit for themselves and to air one of the most watched reality shows. They deserve some compensation for this as the fault is not entirely theirs when a house does not sell.

Either the homes are built in desired neighborhoods, designed and judged on styles that are appealling to the masses, appraised in a realistic manner by experts in that neighborhood and realistic reserves set so contestants can get something out of this, or they continue to build these over the top, over priced ridiculousness and take everything from the sale but have a guaranteed 500k-750k 5 tier prize structure,  paying out based on the highest sell price to the lowest, with the lowest placement or unsold homes given a minimum 50k prize.

1ohhtao,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reverse1999/comments/1ohhtao/allow_orphans_to_meet_their_parents_with_x_a/,Allow orphans to meet their parents with X! A guide (run away),"I am back in your walls! Yes, I have always been in your walls while making these guides, but apparently there's a limit to how long I can stay there :(.

Now that I've somewhat built X (I3 LVL15 R4), it is time to talk about him! 

[Absolutely unrelated\(as in we're talking about a different game\) but hear me out: Sigewinne is meta](https://preview.redd.it/i2ap0dusxnxf1.png?width=1844&format=png&auto=webp&s=23bc0b42a47894a4b770767e88722b0e09a747bd)

To begin with, X is a single-target sub-DPS (more support than DPS) that focuses on one main thing: dispelling any of the opponent's buffs or Moxie. Additionally, he can inflict Disconcert, a Neg Status that prevents the opponent from gaining Moxie and Silence, a Control stat that prevents an opponent from using Debuff, Buff, Heal or Counter cards.

His first skill, Anode and Cathode, is a single-target attack that deals Reality damage. At Rank 2/3, it will also dispel all Stats Up and Pos Status.

His second skill, Coffee or Tea, is another single-target attack that deals Reality damage. However, at Rank 2/3, using this skill will dispel all Counters.

Note for his skills: you should always get both of his skills to at least Rank 2 before playing them in order to use his Dispel. His Rank 1 skills are borderline useless and will deal barely any damage.

His Ultimate, Minimalism and Maximalism, is a multi-target attack that will remove 2 of the opponents Moxie. (trust me, this does look underwhelming but that's because his debuff capabilities are in his Insight)

[He wouldn't snipe an orphan with a shingle, right?](https://preview.redd.it/phj8gnd95oxf1.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=f52966f2d5954c6ea719036bc9106cb7cf29a262)

Onto his Insights!

His first Insight allows him to Silence his opponent if he manages to dispel any buffs from them(1 round if Pos Stat/Stats up and 2 rounds if Counter). This is important as this will allow you to continue ranking up his incantations while his opponents can't use any buffs on themselves.

His second Insight is a damage buff.

His third Insight is arguably his most important one. When he casts his Ultimate, he will apply the Disconcert status to his opponents for one round, preventing them from gaining any Moxie. 

**Best Teams and where to use him!**

X is very flexible and can pretty much be used anywhere that needs a Dispeller and with anyone. However, I recommend using him in Single target fights as he may not be able to keep up with his attacks.

You can use him in Neg Status teams as he applies Disconcert with his Ult. 

You can use him in Rank-up teams because he wants his skills to be ranked up before being used.

You can use him in any stage that is not Mineral-friendly and needs a Dispeller because your Pickles will be cooked otherwise.

**Psychubes and Resonance**

After checking the entire roster, I have come to the conclusion that his best Psychubes are here as follows:

[Balance, Please \(or a shingle may fall on your head :3\)](https://preview.redd.it/73zdoa9y8oxf1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=68cb86474bdb1ea24915a494c0c6dfe3a6617e6f)

Balance, Please can be used if you are planning to get him to deal more damage against non-Spirit enemies.

[Her Second Life has made another appearance once again!](https://preview.redd.it/luy8horf9oxf1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=32c6a15150331c34c94b8676105885f936b4a1a8)

Her Second Life can be used if you want him to have some sustain in his kit as you will be using his Ult many times.

As for Resonance, I've only got him to R5 but you could probably keep his normal one as none of his attacks have any reliance on a stat (apart from ATK of course but you probably shouldn’t do that)

Cons:

Onto my ~~most~~ least favorite part of the guide, his cons:

* As a single-target dispeller, he gets easily outshadowed by characters like Pickles or Avgust, who can do multi target Dispel
* His Disconcert is very short and if you need that for whatever reason, TTT's Disconcert lasts longer
* His Portraits are very weak as they only increase his damage

All in all, X is a decent dispeller that you can use in a Mineral-weak stage. Should you build him? If you need dispel and Moxie reduction, than yes, but there are better options (like Pickles or Avgust). He is one of the many characters that need a Euphoria but are probably never going to get (like Satsuki😔).

1ohhok5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohhok5,Saving Sourdough Discard?,"I have finally established my very own first sourdough starter, and I've made several things. One over-fermented loaf that ended up being super gummy, and a pretty great loaf (pictured) that was a tad underbaked (but I ended up toasting it and made some delicious toast and pressed sandwiches with it!).

The discard recipes I've made have been the best so far. I've made chocolate chip cookies (my favorite), pumpkin coffee cake, and a raspberry lemon loaf cake.

My question now is this: I changed my feeding ratio from 1:1:1 to 1:2:2 (with a little less water), hoping to get my starter extra active. I find it has plenty of bubbles but it's a little too wet than I would like. In this trial, I found out that I had a significant amount of starter, so now I have a TON of discard.

Is it okay to keep the discard in the fridge for a while, or would it be better to prep some stuff and freeze it to use later? (I wanted to do some pie crusts, biscuits, and more cookie dough) I'm brand new to this, so I didn't know if freezing was an option or a good idea.

For reference, my starter was 113g, from 113g of AP flour and 113g filtered water. It doubled, I discarded, then I doubled the feeding so now I have a lot of starter. :')

I've also attached photos of my bakes for advice / feedback. My second loaf had a gummy spot on the bottom, but I'm pretty positive it's because I didn't set my oven hot enough (baked at 475 instead of 500 for 20 minutes covered, then 25 minutes uncovered at 450 instead of 475).",1,1761579356.0,Sourdough,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I was so extremely fatigued. I would wake up after 10 to 12 hours of sleep, yawning, nonstop, needing coffee immediately and dreaming about the time the next time I could nap I would nap when my son was sleeping. I will go to bed early if I was sitting in reading a book, I can fall asleep sitting and watching a movie all of it on top of that I would wake up with anxiety and be rushing around and also dreading any type of chores or anything around the house. I would get up to do a chore and then visualize sitting down or when I could sit down again just to relax because it was exhausting to go around the house and do chores and to do anything even to just play with my son. three nights with the mask and really only two because the first night I only wore it for a few hours. My life feels completely turned around already. I have so much energy. I’m waking up actually feeling refreshed and like I slept the night before and can just not believe that I was living like that for so long.

Coming here so that other people hear my story and also know that it’s possible for them. I also want to share that I went through Lofter instead of going through my local doctor my local doctor could not get me an at home test until mid December and potential treatment until January with Lofta I got everything including that home test appointments, my CPAP and results within a week and a half if you are suffering and financially can afford to go through Lofta I highly recommend it absolute game changer.

Feel like I need someone to pinch me and that this can’t be real and I really can’t believe I went so long living like that. 

I also wanna say push your doctor if they’re not giving you answers or asking the right questions back in May 2025 my doctor diagnosed me with chronic fatigue syndrome without even coming up with sleep apnea as a possible diagnosis.

I'm someone who is at the end of losing weight journey, 121KG (267lbs) > 86KG (189.5lbs). I'm still not quite ready to let go of calorie counting (or probably I'm just too addicted to it by now, been doing this \~1.5 years).

  
So I'm 30 yo male, 191cm (6 foot 3?) and 86kg (189.5lbs) currently. I wouldn't mind losing 2-3 kg more but I'm OK with my current situation.

  
So I'm looking for some help to understand my weekly budget, just something to start with (I'm gonna monitor and adjust it over the weeks). I'm looking for maintenance or like -0.25kg/week pace at max. 

  
Would u say 20 000 kcal / week would be good for me? That's 2857 kcal / day. 

tdeecalculator says my sedentary is 2291 kcal / day. 

  
Mon to Fri 8am - 4pm office job (with some walking, might see a customer, go to lunch, coffee.. etc. I would say 6-7 hrs sitting and 1-2 hrs standing/walking).

  
I walk to work, 3KM (1,86 miles) from mon-fri. After work I walk home a longer walk, around 7-8KM (4,3-5 miles). My walking speed is around 9min / km and my avg HR is 115-117 / min. On weekends I walk 10-12 KM (6.2-7.5 miles) straight. Rule of thumb: 10KM brisk every day. **So to but it simple:** I brisk walk daily 10-12KM, 7 times a week. Average steps daily \~14 000 - 15 000

  
At home I play some games, do laundry, make food, watch TV.. normal life. Pretty sedentary here I'd say.

  
So I'm not sure can I put myself to ""moderately active"", as its just walking. Moderately would be almost 3000 kcal / day for me, so would u say 2857 kcal is OK, or still a bit too high?

The couch above is a modular piece we bought from Burrow a number of years ago. The two of us tend to sit in the two major corners because we like burrowing in there and getting comfortable (pun unintended). 

The table in the center is a very large lift top coffee table that my roommate has had for years. When it's been just him in the past, it works pretty well and he loves it: the added height allows him to set stuff down like his laptop (on a lap desk) more easily, eat more comfortably when watching stuff on TV, etc. When it's the two of us...lifting the table helps his side, but really doesn't do much for where I'm sitting in the corner (usually because it's been pulled closer to his side).

I'd very much like to adjust the U shape of the couch so that the right side is the same length as the left (one of the middle pieces of the couch would just shift over). We tried this previously, and the coffee table fits if you turn it 90 degrees...but just barely, and makes it incredibly uncomfortable to navigate around the edges. I'm fine replacing said table...it's just a matter of ""with what?"" that will still provide the roommate a comfortable and easy spot to use his computer, eat around the couch with me, and...well, look good. (Adding the back pieces did help tremendously, but reaching around behind constantly for drinks and plates gets a little dicey sometimes in terms of risking spills).

His life was defined by things that did not bend: granite, marble, and quartz. His preferred language was the dull, heavy thud of a stone slab settling onto padded supports, and his reputation in the city was simple: if a piece was too heavy, too fragile, or too awkwardly cut for anyone else, you called Roy. They called him the Slab Man.

His workshop was a cathedral of dust and cold. Slabs stood upright in rows, like geological dominoes—sheets of emerald green onyx, speckled salt-and-pepper quartz, and the deep, angry red of Volga Blue granite. Roy lived by the immutable law that stone does not forgive. He measured twice, cut once, and treated every thousand-pound sheet as if it were a sleeping child.

Today’s job was a nightmare cut for a minimalist architect. It was a single, immense piece of Pampas Green quartzite, custom-cut for a sprawling kitchen island on the tenth floor of a newly built condo. The slab was fragile, riddled with fissures, and contained an eight-foot cantilevered curve—a design that screamed for disaster. Roy hated designs that screamed.

Getting it out of the shop was routine, but getting it into the condo was not. The service elevator was too small, which meant the 900-pound slab had to go up the main stairwell. Roy and his apprentice, a nervous boy named Jimmy who had only known theory, stood at the base of the gleaming, polished marble steps.

“It’s too long, Roy,” Jimmy whispered, his voice trembling. “It’s gonna hit the ceiling on the turn.”

Roy didn't look at the ceiling. He looked at the seam in the quartzite, where a vein of iron had formed a weak point. He fixed the heavy-duty suction cups to the stone and tied the lifting straps.

“We don’t think about the ceiling,” Roy grunted, his voice deep and sandy. “We only think about the center. We move together. If I stop, you stop. If you hear a click, you stop.”

They began the ascent. The tension was not in their muscles at first; it was in the stone itself, which groaned softly in protest. The stairwell became a sweatbox, the air thick with fear and effort. Roy moved backward, his eyes locked on the leading edge, his massive forearms trembling only slightly. They managed the first turn, scraping the wall but clearing the ceiling with a quarter-inch to spare.

The final challenge was the kitchen install. The last few feet required lowering the stone precisely onto the waiting cabinetry, with an unnerving three-foot overhang where the seating area would go. The client, a thin, impeccably dressed man, stood by the massive windows, sipping coffee and watching the ordeal.

With a final, synchronized heave, they slid the slab over the cabinets. Roy ignored Jimmy’s frantic gasps and focused entirely on the distance between the stone’s underside and the cabinet’s top. It was less than a millimeter of wiggle room. Roy communicated only with tiny movements of his calloused fingers: Down. Just a breath. Hold.

Clunk.

The Pampas Green quartzite settled perfectly. The delicate curve aligned with the architect’s markings with impossible precision. It was silent for a full minute, broken only by Roy’s heavy, rasping breathing.

The client finally approached, setting his coffee aside. He ran a nervous hand over the cool, flawless surface that had nearly killed two men.

“It’s magnificent, Roy,” the client said, sounding almost reverent. “Truly magnificent. It’s an honor to own such a piece of natural art.”

Roy peeled the suction cups off the stone, leaving only two perfectly round, slightly dusty rings behind. He looked at the flawless slab that had cost more than his annual salary, then back at the nervous, appreciative client.

“I don’t make it art,” Roy said, wiping the sweat and stone dust from his brow with the back of his hand. “I just make it stay.”

He packed his tools into his battered metal box—the hammer, the level, the shims—said a quick word to Jimmy, and left the glass palace of polished stone behind. The next slab was waiting for him, and Roy had a schedule to keep.",1,1761578255.0,u_Parking_Tiger_9703,0,1.0,False

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

Now, I am using preground for the drip bc I stocked up like crazy before the prices went up. I have about 12-15 pounds of coffee I need to be able to use, so I would like to use them.

1ohgzi1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohgzi1,League divisions in Texas.,"The four-panel arc plays like a miniature theology of misunderstanding—polite, funny, and quietly sharp.









**1. The First Tea Shop**





Two Muslim women sit in a calm, sunlit café, the mosque outside mirroring their modest ease. They speak of DOGE—once a currency of internet absurdity—now a fossil of digital faith. Their tone isn’t cynical, just wondering: whatever happened to belief that was silly, harmless, collective?





**2. The Mirror Scene**





Two Catholic nuns repeat the same question, framed by a church instead of a mosque. The repetition turns theological symmetry into irony. Neither group is mocking the other; they’re inhabiting the same cultural joke, unknowing twins across a divide history once demanded they hate. The question echoes beyond crypto—it’s about devotion that used to feel communal, now fragmented and commodified.





**3. The Communion**





All four share a table. Mosque and church share the wall. They joke, “I don’t think it was divisive enough.”

The line lands like a self-aware punchline: centuries of schism and conquest boiled down to four women sipping coffee, weary of the old drama. It’s not unity that’s depicted—it’s the exhaustion of conflict. The cartoon turns mutual fatigue into laughter.





**4. The Texas Field**





Cut to a suburban baseball diamond. A white Texan family—the archetype of moral panic—stares at the TV showing that final café scene. The mother covers the children’s eyes. The father’s polite confusion hovers between concern and curiosity. The joke inside the cartoon has migrated outward: tolerance, too, has an audience.



The field, the church, the mosque—they all become backdrops to the same anxious ritual: deciding what can be seen.









**Arc Summary**





Across the sequence, faith and race shift from interior to exterior frames. The early panels explore intra-religious humor; the last exposes the social choreography around who gets to laugh.



The Muslims and nuns move toward empathy through irony; the Texans recoil from that empathy through fear of contamination. It’s a parable of power—how dominant groups hide from reconciliation while those historically divided find ways to meet over coffee.



DOGE, once an internet coin, becomes the stand-in for collective absurdity we all shared before outrage turned profitable. The cartoons trace that loss—from innocent wonder to guarded consumption—and leave the viewer with a question: who taught us that division was the safest form of belonging?

For the longest time Ive been trying to figure out why, I thought at first it might be because of the book Im reading, which I know has a big cult following for its movie, but the other two times it was a completely different book and it was the same result, teenagers laughing and pointing and then they start filming and Im just there glancing every once in a while and still have no clue why they are doing it.

I was talking about this at a fam get together and my nephew said something about me ""trying too hard"" and so it has me wondering if it has something to do with the fact that there are easier options then reading an actual book like reading an e-book on ur phone or something, so thats why they are making fun of me?

Hey everyone,
I’m 20 years old and I’ve had very little experience with girls and to be honest, the few experiences I’ve had have been mostly negative. I come from a religious background, and relationships haven’t been a big part of my life. Lately, I’ve been more in my head, thinking about my priorities, personal growth, and what I want from life.

A few months ago, I walked into a health store and had a short conversation with a girl working there. She was warm, very kind, and surprisingly open she even mentioned cannabis in a discussion about appetite boosters. That moment stuck with me, even though it was brief.

Three days ago, I randomly ended up at the same store again. She kind of remembered me but mixed me up with someone else, which made the moment a bit funny. That same evening, I decided to challenge myself. I’ve had a poor relationship with girls mostly negative or distant and this time, I wanted to push myself. So I returned to the store near closing time nex day and asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee. She said tea would be better, and we ended up going to a nearby café.

This was the first time in my life I’ve ever done something like this. I was very, very, very nervous, but somehow, with her, I felt safe. She had a calming presence, and for the first time, I actually felt wanted. She has this unique vibe like a wise, spiritual “manna” type of person, but still very Gen Z, open minded, calm, and artsy. She’s an indie music artist, into astrology and esoteric ideas, and we had surprisingly good chemistry.

The conversation was great, the vibe was real, and time passed fast. At the end, she asked for my number and again, I was surprised.

Then she told me that earlier, she had said she was 23, but in reality, she’s 28 That’s an 8-year age gap. I kept it cool in the moment, but inside, it added a new layer of confusion for me.

That night, I was already planning to message her and say I didn’t think I was ready for this. I had even asked a few close people for advice, and they agreed maybe this isn’t the best timing, maybe she’s too far ahead in life. But it got late, and I didn’t write.

Instead, I started feeling this weird emotional cocktail:
A bit of crush
A bit of fear
A wave of anxiety
A strange excitement
Confusion over what to do

I couldn’t sleep well, and I’m not going to lie when I feel strong emotions like excitement or stress, I completely lose my appetite. I’ve barely eaten since yesterday. It’s like my body is holding onto something, waiting for me to do or say something to calm everything down.

She messaged me today, and we had a chill and warm, conversation. She said she was a bit sick, and I felt that maybe now isn’t the right time to write something too heavy. But inside, I’m still confused. 

Here’s my dilemma:
	I don’t want to hurt her feelings. She was sweet and kind, and I felt something genuine.
But I also don’t want to get emotionally trapped in something I’m not ready for. It feels honestly I’m out of her league and, a date with a such beautiful, intelligent for me already was a success for me. 
I have a lot of other priorities in life right now, and I’m trying to stay focused on myself.
Still, a small part of me is drawn to her. She made me feel seen like I mattered.

I honestly think the whole intention of this date was more about proving something to myself that I could challenge myself for a task that I’ve never thought I could do before. But man she left a mark somehow. 

One side of me says: “You’re not ready. Be honest. Walk away respectfully.”
The other side says: “Maybe this could be something. Maybe you’ll regret leaving.”

I don’t want to ghost her. I don’t want to write something that makes her sad either. I genuinely don’t want her to feel rejected. But I also don’t want to lie to myself. It feels like I’m in little bit in love with her,  at the same time I am Experiencing very surreal feeling  and wouldn’t wish it honestly to anyone. 

If you’ve been in a similar situation age difference, different stages of life, intense emotions from your first experiences I’d really appreciate your advice. What would you do in my shoes?

I’m a 27-year-old guy, a native Chinese speaker, and a graduate of Xiamen University 🎓. I’m super eager to level up my conversational English, so I’m on the hunt for a language exchange buddy! If you’re a native/fluent English speaker learning Chinese, let’s team up— I’ll happily help you polish your Mandarin (daily chat, grammar, or even Chinese cultural hacks ✨) in return for practicing casual English with me! My main goal is to get more comfortable with speaking and listening—so regular, casual practice is exactly what I need!

**My English level**

Let me be honest about where I’m at:

* **Listening**: I can follow basic, slow-paced conversations pretty well. But things like complex sentences or fast native speech still throw me off—I often have to ask people to repeat or slow down.
* **Reading**: This is my stronger side! I can understand most daily English texts smoothly, like messages, short articles, or social media posts.

**A little about me & my hobbies**

* **Long-distance running 🏃♂️**: It’s my favorite way to unwind! I love pushing my limits during a run and exploring new routes—there’s nothing like the endorphin rush after a good jog.
* **Guitar 🎸**: Total beginner alert! I’ve just started fumbling with basic chords and simple songs (think “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” level 😂). If you play too, we can geek out about music together—no judgment on my newbie skills!
* **Photography 📸**: I’m obsessed with capturing daily little moments—street scenes, sunset glows, even my morning coffee if the light hits it right. Always down to chat about favorite shots or camera gear (even if I’m still learning the ropes!).

I’m sure we can find tons to talk about, whether it’s hobbies, life, or our weirdest cultural quirks!

**Available Time & How We Can Practice**

# 🕒 My Available Time (Beijing Time, CST)

If I have no other plans that day, I’m free during these windows:

* Morning: 8:00 – 11:00
* Afternoon: 14:00 – 17:00
* Evening: 19:00 – 22:00

For reference, here’s how these times translate to some major time zones:

* **Eastern Time (ET, US/Canada)**: Previous day 19:00 – 22:00 (evening), current day 01:00 – 04:00 (early morning), current day 03:00 – 06:00 (early morning)
* **Central Time (CT, US/Canada)**: Previous day 18:00 – 21:00 (evening), current day 00:00 – 03:00 (midnight/early morning), current day 02:00 – 05:00 (early morning)
* **Western Time (PT, US/Canada)**: Previous day 16:00 – 19:00 (afternoon/evening), current day 22:00 – 01:00 (night/early morning), current day 00:00 – 03:00 (midnight/early morning)
* **Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)**: Current day 00:00 – 03:00 (midnight/early morning), current day 08:00 – 11:00 (morning), current day 11:00 – 14:00 (noon/afternoon)

**📱 Practice Style**

First off—**let’s keep it relaxed and fun**! No pressure, just two people chatting and learning together. I’m flexible with platforms—Reddit DMs, Discord, WeChat, or whatever app you prefer works for me.

I’d love to move to voice calls eventually, since my main goal is to practice speaking and listening. But I totally get if you (or I!) need time to warm up first! If you’d prefer to start with only text chats in the beginning, that’s 100% okay. We can stick to texts as long as you feel comfortable—there’s no rush to jump into calls.

No rush at all—we can go at a pace that works for both of us!

If you’re into learning Chinese, can help me with English, and our time zones align, don’t hesitate to DM me or leave a comment below! I’m stoked to meet new friends and grow our language skills together 🚀.

She claims she lost 100lbs from that surgery, but during that year that she had to wait, doctor's orders told them to wait 1yr until trying to conceive, she gained back most of what she lost. Once the year was up in Nov 2022, she assumed she'd get pregnant right away by Christmas the very next month. She was manifesting it & truly believed if she wished it enough, it would happen. When it didn't, she started her whole TTC rebrand & spent the next 6 months straight talking non-stop about her trying to conceive journey. She posted several clickbait videos during that time, with title's saying ""thought I was pregnant"" where she explained that she was the ""healthiest"" she's been because she was using copilot. She gained a large following within this time of a whole new crowd, the beautiful TTC community who listened & left encouragement for her in her comments. Only to tell them ""talk amongst yourselves, I'm done"" saying she was putting a ""big old pause button"" on the topic for her mental health. 

Then she filmed Curvy Connection, it was a massive flop & she said she had a alleged miscarriage during that time. She posted that video to reel her TTC audience right back in again, wanting their sympathy, even though she flat out IGNORED their heartfelt personal stories of loss themselves. She gave zero fucks about their feelings, because it's all about ALEX!! Once she wasn't getting pregnant fast enough, she gave up on weight loss altogether & dove head first into binge eating again. People were asking her about the gym & she told them it was ""diet culture"" she wasn't talking about her bypass surgery anymore. She started getting extremely bitchy & passive aggressive, telling people who were there for her ""health journey"" to click off if they get triggered by a FAT PERSON EATING, because she was indulging on fried foods at the fair with her mom. She started eating more on camera, gaining & clapping back if anyone dare mention weight loss. She amped up her manifestation during vlogmas putting the wrapped baby blanket underneath the tree, doing all these sad reels with music for her ""rainbow baby"". 

By January 2024 she was pregnant & did her obgyn RANT saying they were discriminating her & fat shaming her because she was morbidly obese & high risk. She then spent the next 8 months rubbing her pregnancy in the faces of the women who did nothing but support her & pray for her. Telling them ""FUCK NO"" she wouldn't stop talking about her pregnancy even though it was highly insensitive. This girl has a pattern, she's setting the stage as we speak to quit WW because she feels that she lost enough weight to get pregnant. Going forward she's going to get pissed if anyone brings up her weight, she's gonna indulge on food all Nov & Dec & talk about TTC. Just wait on it, she's predictable as fuck.

1ohgvsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/1ohgvsm/back_in_beijing_after_5_years_in_london_and/,Back in Beijing after 5 years in London… and feeling a bit out of sync 🇨🇳🇬🇧,"Hey everyone,

I’m a born-and-bred Beijinger who somehow ended up living in London for the past five years (2020–2025). I recently moved back to Beijing after quitting my job in August, and honestly, I’m still adjusting：）

I’ve realised I’ve somehow become too London. I queue without thinking, apologise when someone bumps into me, and expect strangers to complain about the weather with me. Meanwhile, back in Beijing, everyone just moves too fast and I feel like I’ve forgotten how to “Beijing” properly.

Don’t get me wrong. it’s great being back, but everything feels a bit foreign in my own hometown. I kinda miss the London vibe, the dry humour, the random pub chats, the chill pace (well, relatively speaking).

So I’m wondering if there are any expats (or locals who vibe with the UK lifestyle) around Beijing who fancy grabbing a coffee, a beer, or just having a good chat about how weird “reverse culture shock” is.

Would love to make some new friends who get what it’s like to feel in between two worlds. If you are interested in hangout and grib a drink, you can leave a comment:) Cheers 🍻

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1ohguk0,https://i.redd.it/yz5dsjwa6oxf1.jpeg,Coffee-Coffee Fruit (Kōhī Kōhī no Mi),"Type: Paramecia

The Coffee-Coffee Fruit turns its user into a Coffee Human, granting them the ability to create, manipulate, and become coffee and coffee plants in all their natural and brewed forms. The user can produce steaming espresso, roasted beans, aromatic vines, and even caffeine-rich vapor, weaponizing both energy and exhaustion. This fruit balances humor, stamina control, and botanical versatility, making its wielder both unpredictable and dangerous.

Abilities:

•Coffee Generation: The user can create and control coffee in any form—liquid, steam, bean, or plant matter. Different roasts carry distinct effects: light roasts can soothe or energize, dark roasts dehydrate and burn, while espresso roasts explode with intensity.
	
•Coffea Growth: The user can instantly sprout coffee vines, leaves, and cherries from the ground or their body. The plants can bind enemies, deflect attacks, or ripen into beans that serve as ammunition. Their aroma can either calm or stimulate depending on the brew.
	
•Steam Jet: The user can compress coffee internally and release it as a superheated jet of espresso steam. This allows propulsion, mid-air mobility, or scalding melee attacks. The steam also clouds the air, obscuring vision and irritating the senses.
	
•Caffeine Manipulation: The user can alter caffeine levels within living targets. They can overcharge enemies until their bodies shake uncontrollably, induce exhaustion through a crash, or temporarily boost an ally’s physical and mental speed at the cost of later fatigue.

•Bean Bullets: The user can harden roasted beans into projectiles fired at high speed. They can ricochet, explode into hot coffee spray, or paralyze with concentrated caffeine. Variants like “Decaf Rounds” drain stamina, while “Arabica Bursts” ignite on impact.
	
•Dehydration Drain: Direct exposure to the user’s coffee saps moisture from the target, leaving them weak, dizzy, and desiccated.
	
•Espresso Fog: The user releases a dense mist of caffeinated steam that conceals movement and exhausts anyone caught inside once the energy spike fades.
	
•“Bathroom Break” Technique: By overloading an opponent’s system with caffeine, the user triggers an uncontrollable reaction that incapacitates them in comedic fashion.

Signature Techniques:
	
•Double Shot Burst: Fires two compressed jets of espresso at high pressure.
	
•Cold Brew Shield: Condenses chilled coffee into a hardened, glassy barrier.
	
•Latte Lasso: A whip of foamed coffee and vines used to burn or restrain.
	
•Arabica Barrage: Rapid-fire bean bullets that detonate into hot spray.
	
•Caffeine Crashfield: Fills the area with vapor that heightens speed and reaction before forcing a collective crash.

Awakening:
When awakened, the Coffee-Coffee Fruit transforms the environment into a caffeine-charged ecosystem. Coffee plants erupt from the soil, streams turn into espresso rivers, and the air becomes thick with caffeinated vapor. Everyone within the area grows more energetic and unstable, moving faster until exhaustion strikes all at once. The awakened user can also absorb the excess kinetic energy from movement and stimulation, using it to sustain their own strength.

Drawbacks:
Overuse causes severe caffeine overload, resulting in trembling, headaches, and exhaustion. The user must stay hydrated to avoid burnout, as their powers rely on moisture. Boosted allies may faint once their caffeine rush ends, and prolonged exposure can backfire if not carefully managed.",4,1761577491.0,DevilFruitIdeas,0,1.0,False

And honestly, I used to hate Mondays. I’d wake up already tired, thinking about how long the week was going to be. But lately, I’ve been trying to change that mindset.

Nothing crazy, just 15-20 minutes to move my body.  It’s wild how that small act completely changed my energy.  I came back, showered, planned my day, and felt this wave of clarity like I was in control of the week, not the other way around.  Discipline isn’t about being perfect.

 I always put his needs first and i met his family and friends and came to care about them dearly but a couple of months passed by and i realised that i completely forgot aboyt MY friends and family and even myself. 

Once i realised that ive let myself and my needs in the backseat i started spending more time at home and i only saw him twice a week. that didnt stick right with him tho. so he started complaining even when we were together making me feel like whatever i did wasnt enough.

around that time he started making commends about every male around me no matter the interaction i had with him. Ive tried to explain that this behavior of his made uncomfortable and stressed me out but everytime i mentioned anything he would bawled his eyes out so i held back and comforted him instead.

in september some uni friends came to visit and he wanted to see them as he had already met them in november and they got along well. Since it was their last day we made plans that we'll meet for a coffee once we arrived closer to the airport ( its a hour away from my parents place and he lives in the same city where the airport is) but he wanted to leave his place and come to ours and leave again the same day sowe can all be together.

Over the phone i explained that wasnt the plan and it made things complicated for no reason. He pussed too far saying i just didnt want him there and i lost my cool. so i yelled back saying that his plan made the trip more difficult since we already had a car fillled with luggage and we were 4 people not counting him.hearing my voice he immediately started crying and whining about how i raised my voice at himcompletely missing the point.

Next morning i pick everyone up including him, annoyed and not in the mood. Every minute i was not there he spent trying to get my friends to tell him whether i would break up with him or not, he accused me of cheating and even tried to threaten one of friends to ''spill the tea''.

After we dropped my friends at the airport we started heading back to my place so he could get his car, on the way he repeatedly asked if i wanted to break  up like he did every time we had a fight only this time i was over it and aswered yes.

Wash (20s) - aroma of peaty soil, mushrooms, peppercorns

Steep 1 (10s) - inky black color, oily black coffee bitterness lingers, turning woodsy, sweetness comes late injecting a bit of cola syrup as the bitterness fades, that sweetness is almost unexpected and sets the stage for the next sip, already the bitterness is starting to be tamed by the finish

Steep 2 (5s) - forest floor immediately turns to black peppercorn and camphor as a menthol coolness sweeps across the tongue, then oily espresso bitterness fades in, tongue tingle from the residual camphor as the sweetness climbs up the gums and cheeks

Steep 3 (10s) - that camphor note is rising out of the glass to meet my nose as I go in for a sip, pine resin and Vicks Vaporub float above the sticks and leaves on my tongue, spiced apple cider donut note comes with the sweetness

Steep 4 (20s) - bitterness back up, very thick in the mouth, tingle on the lips, sweetness rising to meet the piny oily notes, starting to feel the caffeination kick in as well

Steep 5+ (30s) - autumn in a gaiwan, I don't often pair food with tea, but this was the perfect match for that chocolate brownie that my family saved for me

Overall Impression - This is my first gongfu session with a shou puer in a long time. I dont drink shou often, and when I do it's usually brewed in a mug at work. I'm really glad I took some time for a thoughtful session with this tea. I think western-style brewing dilutes the sweetness that comes easily in a thick and focused gongfu session where the sips can stack up on one another. 

I prefer this type of shou with a solid bitterness because it offers something to back up that earthy, leaf litter character. It caught me off guard just how sweet this gets in the finish, but it tracks with how bitter sheng often develops a deep sweetness like this. The 2020 Peerless Bronze Label introduced me to this type of shou, and this one seems to be a bit of an upgrade worthy of being called Gold Label. Full, rich, but clean flavor. No fishy wet pile notes, or any funkiness that I can find. If I drank enough shou to warrant buying a cake I would splurge on one of these without hesitation.",9,1761577197.0,puer,0,1.0,False

*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams (One with More Injuries Than a Halloween Costume Party)**

The Portland Trail Blazers enter this matchup as a **58.3% favorite** (-142) despite missing **Damian Lillard** (Achilles), **Scoot Henderson** (hamstring), and **Robert Williams III** (knee). Their defense, however, is a statistical marvel: **7th in defensive rating**, leading the league in **steals (11.7)** and **deflections (27.7)**. They’re the NBA’s version of a spam filter—letting few points through and forcing turnovers like a toddler hoarding cookies.

The Lakers, meanwhile, are a **41.7% underdog** (+142) with a roster that reads like a ""Who’s Who of Injuries."" **LeBron James** (sciatica), **Luka Doncic** (leg/finger—wait, isn’t he in Dallas? *Note to self: Check for typos*), and **Maxi Kleber** (oblique) are out, leaving **Austin Reaves** to carry the torch. Reaves, who dropped a career-high 51 points against the Kings, is now the Lakers’ version of a ""Hail Mary""—high-risk, high-reward.

The **-2.5-point spread** suggests a nail-biter, and the **226.5 total** hints at a high-scoring affair… unless Portland’s defense turns the Crypto.com Arena into a freezer.

---

**2. Digest the News: When Absences Become the Star**

* **Portland’s ""Ghost Team"" Lineup**: Without Lillard, the Blazers rely on **Deni Avdija** (26 points vs. Warriors) and **Jerami Grant** (22 points in same game). Their recent 139-119 win over Golden State was so dominant, their interim coach **Tiago Splitter** (a former NBA center known for his defensive prowess) probably earned his first win by accident.
* **Lakers’ ""Why Is This Happening?"" Squad**: The Lakers are missing **4 key players**, including LeBron, and are now led by Reaves, who’s averaging **34 PPG** this season. It’s like asking a barista to run a coffee shop—charming until the espresso machine explodes.

Portland’s coach, **Chauncey Billups**, is currently on leave after being arrested for money laundering. Splitter’s interim reign is a plot twis

Honestly, I *love* how hands-on it feels; it really forces you to be intentional with every dollar.

But over time, I realized I was spending more time **updating** my spreadsheet than actually managing my money. Logging every coffee, moving numbers around, fixing formulas, it got exhausting.

So I started looking for something that could keep that *envelope discipline*, but do the heavy lifting automatically. That’s when I found **Savida**, an AI budgeting app that actually learns your spending habits and tracks categories for you.

It still gives you the same visibility you’d get in Aspire, but instead of you updating it, it quietly does it in the background. It even sends nudges like “You’ve hit your food budget cap for this week” or “You saved 18% more than last month.”

For anyone who loves the *idea* of envelope budgeting but wants something a little more automated, it might be worth checking out.  
 Not promoting anything, just sharing what’s been working for me lately.

My partner (M36) and myself (F35) have been together 10 years and have a toddler. Before the little one I didn’t feel he was that emotionally mature but he changed lots when the little one was born (inc giving up lots of bad habits). He’s done really well in that respect and he’s done it for her without any pressure from anyone.

Problem is, now when he’s super stressed (every 6-8 months) he blows up. He’ll say horrible things to me around the little one, blame me for everything & for how he reacts/acts towards me. Yesterday I said we needed a plan to get out the house/see his mum and he got all angry (he was already stressed about money) and went to slam a door just as the little one was following him. I shouted ‘watch out’ and he instantly said ‘that was your fault, I want to throw my coffee mug at you, you horrible c**t’. I’m almost 6 months pregnant and tried to keep it together whilst taking the toddler to play. He then comes in the playroom and rants more. I tell him I’m recording the conversation so that he’s not so horrible to me (because he fears being judged & he normally repeats the same things that hurt). He then says how terrifying I am and how he can’t trust me. It went on, all recorded, in front of the little one. I stopped even responding and tried to keep playing with the little one so she didn’t think we were part of his angry rambles. 

What am I supposed to think? Since then we’ve been quietly civil but he never sees that you can’t blame others for your reactions, they are YOUR reactions. He says he reacts that was because I bait him. 

Anyway, tired & pregnant and just needed to get this out. He’s 9 out of 10 normally a very nice funny guy who’s very caring towards our toddler & others. ",1,1761576965.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I wanted to double text you the past couple days but I haven’t, I think she took the joke I was trying to make in a weird way and it turned her away.

They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.

I’ve been working hard on meeting and keeping new friends for about 2 years. I’ve met some awesome people through my group fitness class. I even went out with them Saturday night! 

I usually go on Wednesdays and Fridays. I’m definitely going this Friday and we’re going to wear Halloween costumes. We often go out for coffee afterwards. 

But this Wednesday I got invited by a totally different group of friends for breakfast- at the same time as my fitness class. I hate missing the class bc it gives me such a great dopamine hit AND I feel like I’ve met my people. 

The group that invited me - we originally met through our kids forever ago. But as our kids have gotten older, I rarely see them. I haven’t seen this group since last school year. They almost never invite me to anything they do outside of the occasional breakfast / coffee. I am definitely a fringe friend to them - and one of convenience bc I am one of the people with a flexible schedule and therefore available on a Wednesday morning. 

I have one friend in that group who is truly my friend outside of that bunch - and she wants to go. I obviously don’t need to go just bc she’s going. 

Any way, my very long point is - I struggle with missing my beloved fitness class and new friends (even once) to meet up with friends who are more like acquaintances at this point. BUT - it sure is nice to be asked! And it’s probably good to keep meeting up with a variety of people bc we all know friendships with anyone can change fast!",2,1761576481.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1ohg9ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1ohg9ht/not_sure_what_to_make_of_this_im_disappointed/,Not sure what to make of this?  I'm disappointed!,"So I (28F) started hanging out with a guy (34M) I met through mutual friends about 6 weeks ago. We had an amazing connection, but kept it friendly (except some flirting) all 6 times (long and intense meetings) we met, my attraction grew for him during this time but I liked the lack of pressure from meeting in a friendly way and exploring organically. It was about a 50/50 split in terms of initiating plans, maybe slightly more from my side.

Then the end of the 6th time he kissed me, and I was glad we waited that long. It was cute and natural and he said how happy he was to have met me. I returned the feeling.

One thing I noticed is he doesnt seem to be a planner, at all, more a go with the flow type. He asked me to meet last minute a few days after we kissed, but it didn’t work out from his side and then I got sick. Then both of us were very busy the next 5 days (although I would have been up to fit in even a brief coffee since he was going away) before he had to go on a week long work trip that he just returned from a few days ago.

Nothing is in the diary. Yet he enthusiastically talks to me most days. I don’t want to be the one to initiate right now, as I’m trying to understand if he’s interested or not. He talks like he is, our connection is wonderful, but without the action of seeing eachother in person I’m left uncertain and tbh quite anxious since we haven’t met since we kissed now 3 weeks ago. Anyone has any advice?

I’ve been dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety, I broke my elbow and shoulder in June and until September I had to stop working, my husband started to work 14 hours a day, our baby girl had to change school and we have financial urgent issues. This is will be the first month I’ll have my full salary! On top of that we are dancers and we have an important agenda with the city hall. I’m feeling stressed, tired and overwhelmed, I work in a nursery at full time job and as a ballet teacher part time and I’m out of home for 10-12 hours during the week so I miss my daughter so much and sometimes I cry and I don’t want this job anymore… yesterday at 7pm my mom made a big cup of coffee with cocoa (I don’t drink coffee) and I accepted it. After my daughter fell asleep at 9pm I started to work on my phone, looking for Christmas ballet costumes for my students. At midnight I stopped working and went to sleep… but I couldn’t sleep! I tossed and turned all night, my head was heavy, I felt anxious… in my brain I was still working! My eyes wouldn’t close even tho I was so tired… I always checked my phone to see the hours. At 3 am I went to the kitchen to eat a banana with peanut butter and went back to bed… then I remember I read a few years ago that soldiers sleep on their backs and focus on breathing and that was what I did… eventually I slept and woke up again at 6am with the sound of the clock, I hit the snooze and slept a little bit more till 7am…I feel terrible and sleepy and tired. Tried to take a nap in my lunch time but I can’t.
Was it because of the coffee? Hiperstimulation and anxiety?
I’m nervous if it will happen again tonight.
Thank you.

54M here, and 8 years ago, she (48F) drifted out after our ""solid"" life—house, plans, passion turned polite. No fight, no cheat, just ""no spark."" I chased with texts and talks; it backfired, leaving me in ""what if"" hell. Then no contact hit—not a game, but my lifeline. Blocked all, no peeks. First 30 days? Torture. By day 45, clarity came—she reached out ""you seem different."" We didn't reunite, but I was whole. Coached a 32M through his 2-year split; he tried these, and his ex started chats. If you're doubting, these steps turned my pain to power. Real, simple, no tricks.

1. Commit to Pause: 30-60 days—no contact. Tell a friend for backup. Day 1 hurts, but it's detox for your brain.
2. Fill the Quiet: 10 mins daily ""me time"" (walk, journal). My coffee rituals quieted the noise.
3. Spot Patterns: Ask ""What kept me stuck?"" Journal it. Revealed my fixer habits—freed me.
4. Glow Up Subtle: One weekly change (gym, hobby). Builds confidence that draws good in.
5. Vision Forward: Picture ""me in 6 months"" strong. Pulled me from stuck to stepping.

Pain's temporary; your comeback's forever. You're leveling up. What's your no-contact day count?

TL;DR: 54M after 8-year drift shares 5 no-contact steps: Pause commit, quiet fill, patterns spot, subtle glow, forward vision. Helped friend. Your count?

Grateful—one breath freer.

1ohg686,https://www.reddit.com/r/agencycrm/comments/1ohg686/beginners_guide_setting_up_your_first_agency/,Beginner's guide: Setting up your first agency pipeline,"**Why You Need a Pipeline**

If you're tracking leads in spreadsheets, sticky notes, or your inbox—you're losing deals. A proper pipeline shows you exactly where every prospect is, what needs to happen next, and prevents leads from falling through the cracks.

This guide works with **any CRM** (HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, Monday, Streak, Airtable, Growlio, or even a well-structured spreadsheet to start).

**The Basic Agency Pipeline (5 Stages)**

Here's a simple pipeline that works for most agencies:

|Stage|What It Means|Key Actions|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**1. Lead In**|Someone showed interest|Qualify: budget, timeline, fit|
|**2. Discovery**|You're talking to them|Book meeting, send questions|
|**3. Proposal**|You've sent pricing/scope|Follow up, answer questions|
|**4. Negotiation**|They're interested but discussing|Handle objections, revise terms|
|**5. Closed Won**|They signed!|Kick off project, send onboarding|

**Closed Lost** is separate—for deals that didn't work out (tag with reason: budget, timing, fit, ghosted).

**How to Build It (Step-by-Step)**

**Step 1: Choose Your Tool**

**If you're just starting:**

* Free: Google Sheets + template, Streak (Gmail), Trello
* Paid but cheap: Pipedrive ($14/mo), Zoho CRM ($14/mo), Growlio
* Free tier works: HubSpot, Monday.com

**Don't overthink this.** Pick something you'll actually use. You can migrate later.

**Step 2: Create Your Stages**

In your CRM, create 5 columns/stages with the names above. Most CRMs let you drag-and-drop deals between stages.

**Pro tip:** Add expected close dates to each deal so you know what's urgent.

**Step 3: Add These Essential Fields**

For each deal, track:

**Required:**

* Contact name
* Company name
* Email
* Deal value (estimated project size)
* Expected close date

**Helpful:**

* Lead source (referral, website, cold outreach)
* Service needed (SEO, design, dev, etc.)
* Last contact date
* Next step (e.g., ""Send proposal by Friday"")

**Step 4: Define Stage Actions**

**What moves a deal forward at each stage?**

|Stage|Entry Requirement|Exit Action|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Lead In|They filled form / replied to email|Qualification call booked|
|Discovery|Meeting scheduled|Discovery call completed|
|Proposal|Call done, needs identified|Proposal sent|
|Negotiation|Proposal opened/questions asked|All objections handled|
|Closed Won|Contract signed|Project kickoff scheduled|

Write these down. This is your playbook.

**Step 5: Set Up Simple Automations**

**Even basic CRMs can do this:**

1. **Auto-email when deal enters ""Proposal""**
   * ""Thanks for your time—here's our proposal. Reply with questions.""
2. **Task reminder 3 days after proposal sent**
   * ""Follow up with \[Name\] on proposal""
3. **Weekly digest of stalled deals**
   * Anything in Discovery or Proposal for 7+ days without activity

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too many stages** – Keep it simple. 5-7 max.  
❌ **No clear definitions** – Everyone should know what ""Discovery"" means.  
❌ **Forgetting to update** – If it's not in the CRM, it doesn't exist. Update after every call.  
❌ **No follow-up system** – Set reminders or deals go cold.  
❌ **Tracking too much** – Start with basics, add fields as you need them.

# What Good Looks Like (Sample Pipeline View)

**Lead In (4 deals)**

* Acme Co — $5k, closes 11/15
* Jane's Shop — $3k, qualified
* Two more...

**Discovery (2 deals)**

* Widget Inc — $12k, call today
* Another deal...

**Proposal (3 deals)**

* Tech Startup — $8k, sent 10/23
* Design Co — $15k, sent 10/20
* Local Biz — $4k, sent 10/25

**Negotiation (1 deal)**

* Big Corp — $25k, pricing discussion

**Closed Won (2 deals)**

* Coffee Co — $10k
* Shoe Brand — $7k

**At a glance:** 3 proposals out, 1 in negotiation, need to follow up on the 10/20 proposal.

**Next Steps After Setup**

**Week 1:** Move all current leads into the pipeline  
**Week 2:** Update it daily (takes 5 min)  
**Week 3:** Review weekly—what's stuck? What's moving?  
**Month 2:** Add one automation or field that saves you time

Stewed cherry, blueberry, leather, mushroom, and slight grassiness.

first, i asked gpt to help write a short emotional brand story only 45 seconds long, about a local coffee brand connecting people through shared mornings. then i moved the storyboard into ideogram for concept visuals.

i fed those stills into domoai with prompts like “morning sunlight,” “steam rising,” and “slow camera pan across the table.” domoai’s ai video generator turned them into moving shots that honestly looked cinematic.

next, i used elevenlabs to voice the story. the voice felt warm and natural exactly what i imagined. i layered it all in capcut and added gentle piano music in the background.

the result didn’t just look professional it felt real. it told a story.

what makes this exciting is how ai story generators and ai video generators can merge emotion with design.

anyone here experimenting with emotional branding videos using ai? what tools are you combining with domoai to make narratives feel more human?",1,1761575566.0,UserExperienceDesign,0,1.0,False

I think I feel stifled, so when I hear someone scraping the ever loving crap of their yogurt cup, without a care in the world…I get a little irritated, like “WHY CAN THEY MAKE NOISE, but I feel embarrassed to even blow my nose?”

Like my back pack weighs about 20ibs got a full set of clothes in there, steel toed boots for work, a towel(lol), and a whatever im bringing for lunch plus a water bottle.  In spring and late summer I was also carrying a hoodie in my back pack to wear underneath my jacket because it would be hot going in to work in the evening and cold coming back in the morning(work 12 hour night shifts).

So now the roads are damp and cold , visors fogging up(ik I can get a pinlock) legit opening and closing my visor the whole ride lol and no im not a mouth breather I never had this issue in spring  or summer rain. This morning my visor was fogged to the point I coud barely see , the road was wet, im opening my visor and there is cold air then hitting my face despite wearing a balaclava and since it was lightly raining on and off would get water hitting my eyes. Glare from oncoming cars blinding me especialy with fogged visor and low light areas with no street lights lol.

I thought to myself I can just be chilling in a car with music playing, water bottle on hand or coffee etc etc heater cranked up, then I thought wtf have I been doing carrying shit in a large back pack to work and getting soaked only to get to work and go straight to the washroom to dry up?

Two hours ago, I suddenly realized I had been in Gap for two years, but my deposit hasn’t decrease much. This matter is quite interesting and beyond my understanding, so I'll do a self-reflection and record it.

Feel free to discuss and share knowledge about making money.

Before deciding to take the Gap, I had some “f\*\*\* you money” money, enough to support around five years of personal life. I thought the Gap was necessary because at the time, the industry I was in wasn’t going to be my career for life, so I spent my youth searching for a second income source.

During the entire Gap period, my requirements for myself were:

1. Try different industries, drop old thoughts, and let new ideas develop.
2. Don't be so focused on money-making projects, but more on choosing projects based on interest.

This is my understanding of the Gap: not fight for traditional success or development, but to give myself a period to look at the world and understand the world.

The following are the side jobs I did during my 2-year gap:

1. Barista: I usually look for coffee shops I like in my city, and if there’s an open spot, I’ll take a part-time job there. I prefer cafes with unique interiors and interesting customers, it makes work feel less tiring. But to be honest, this job can be physically demanding, and the pay isn’t great.
2. Account Executive in Advertising: The reason I got into this is that my previous job was related to the ad industry, so I already had some clients who started reaching out to me for freelance projects. It feels a lot freer than working for a company, but it also requires more self-discipline and planning. I mainly handle client communication, content planning, and project follow-ups. It’s not physically exhausting, but it’s still pretty draining, classic agency life haha.
3. Stocks & Funds: My investment strategy is pretty simple. I use half of my capital for short-term trades in stocks I’m familiar with, usually making about 1–8% every two months. The other half goes into areas I’m less familiar with, but I try to analyze candlestick charts and follow the news daily to predict trends. Since I’m still learning, the results are pretty average, probably below what a rational investor would typically earn.
4. Youtuber: I generate story outlines using ChatGPT and make videos with MagicLight. The workflow is pretty simple, which allows for regular updates, and it’s a high cost-performance side job. There were times I was anxious about data, but then I realized I couldn’t control the flow. Learning some tricks and posting on different platforms helped me create more engaging content. The results were decent, and I’m also exploring new ways to monetize this account.
5. DJ: I have some friends who make music, and we often hang out at clubs together. I’ve always been interested in making music too, but I never had time to learn when I was working full-time. So during my gap period, I studied some DJ basics and started working part-time at a small club I really like. I love the job, though I often worry I’m not good enough yet — but surprisingly, it actually pays pretty well.",3,1761575359.0,sidehustle,2,0.81,False

She planned my first and second birthdays, but this year all she did was text me “happy birthday.” It really hurt — no dinner, no card, no small gesture. I tried to let it go, but deep down it stung because I was honestly expecting something.

What makes it worse is that she’s celebrated everyone else’s birthdays recently — her son’s, her dad’s, her mom’s, even her friends’. Meanwhile, I got a text.

A few months later, I planned a really nice hiking trip and a day in Vegas at a resort to celebrate her birthday early. On her actual birthday, I baked her a cake, got her a small present, and ordered her favorite food.

Recently I brought up how much it hurt that she didn’t do anything for mine. She brushed it off and didn’t really have an explanation.

To add to it, we live separately, and a few months ago she mentioned wanting to build a pool. I was hesitant because we’ve talked about buying a house together, so I didn’t think it made sense. She went ahead with it anyway. I later found out construction had already started — and when I confronted her, she lied and said it hadn’t.

I told her I knew she was lying and that I didn’t appreciate it. She said she only lied because she was afraid of how I’d react. We were having coffee, and I just got up and walked out. She got mad and asked if I was really going to walk out on her, but I kept walking. I haven’t heard from her since.

So I’m wondering:

Am I wrong for feeling like she does things for everyone else but not me?

Am I wrong for wanting her to make an effort for my birthday the way I do for hers?

And was it justified to walk out after she lied to me?


How would you handle this situation?

Staring down the barrel of a brilliant business idea, only to realize you're short on cash? Been there. It's the entrepreneurial equivalent of hitting a brick wall. Banks can be slow and demanding, and sometimes a loan just isn't the right fit. I'm here to tell you that you *can* find funding without drowning in debt or jumping through endless hoops. This is the story of how I secured $10,000 for my US-based business without a traditional bank loan, and how you can do it too.

**The Challenge:** Starting up, scaling, or even pivoting in the business world often requires capital. Whether it's for marketing, inventory, website development, or just covering initial operational costs, money is usually tight, especially in the early stages. Traditional lending institutions often demand collateral, extensive business history, and perfect credit, all of which can be major hurdles for fledgling businesses. Many of us are forced to rely on personal savings (which can be risky), or max out credit cards (yikes!). There *has* to be a better way, right?

**Unlocking Funding: The Bootstrap Bonanza**

The key is creativity, resourcefulness, and a willingness to hustle. I combined several strategies that, when added together, made a significant difference. Here's the breakdown:

* **Step-by-Step or Key Points: 1. Micro-Grants and Competitions - Your Secret Weapon.**
    * Look for industry-specific micro-grants. These are often overlooked but offer small sums ($500 - $2,000) with less competition than larger grants. Focus on grants that align with your business values (e.g., sustainability, community impact).
    * Enter small business competitions! Local and regional competitions often offer cash prizes or in-kind services (marketing, legal consulting) which can be just as valuable. Platforms like Hello Alice often aggregate these opportunities.
    * **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Let's say you run a sustainable clothing brand. Search for grants focused on eco-friendly businesses or ethical manufacturing. A win-win!
    * **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't get discouraged by rejection. View each application as a learning experience and refine your pitch. Proofread *everything*!

* **Step-by-Step or Key Points: 2. Leveraging Existing Assets – The Power of Bartering and Trade.**
    * Think about what skills or resources you already possess. Can you offer your services (e.g., web design, content creation, social media management) in exchange for other goods or services your business needs (e.g., office space, marketing materials)?
    * Identify complementary businesses in your area and explore partnership opportunities. Can you cross-promote each other's products or services?
    * **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** If you're a baker, could you offer a batch of cookies to a local coffee shop in exchange for advertising your business to their customers?
    * **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Always formalize barter agreements in writing to avoid misunderstandings. Clearly define the scope of services and the value exchanged.

* **Step-by-Step or Key Points: 3. Smart Crowdfunding - It's More Than Just Begging.**
    * Don't just throw up a crowdfunding campaign and hope for the best. Craft a compelling story that resonates with your target audience. Explain *why* you need the funding and *what* you plan to do with it.
    * Offer tangible rewards for different levels of contribution. People are more likely to donate if they get something in return (e.g., early access to your product, a discount, a personalized thank you note).
    * Actively promote your campaign on social media, through email marketing, and to your personal network. Engage with your backers and keep them updated on your progress.
    * **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** If you're launching a new board game, offer backers the chance to get a signed copy, have their name included in the rulebook, or even design a custom character.
    * **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't underestimate the power of video! A well-produced video can significantly increase your chances of success. Be realistic about your funding goal and timeline.

* **Step-by-Step or Key Points: 4. Pre-Selling Your Products/Services - Generate Revenue Before Launch.**
    * Offer pre-orders for your products or services at a discounted rate. This allows you to generate revenue upfront and gauge demand before you invest heavily in production or inventory.
    * Create a waitlist for your product or service and offer exclusive early-bird pricing to those who sign up.
    * Run a limited-time promotion to encourage early adopters to purchase your product or service.
    * **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** If you're opening a new restaurant, offer gift cards at a discount before you officially open your doors.
    * **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Be transparent about your timeline and keep your customers updated on your progress. Don't overpromise and underdeliver.

*   **Hello Alice:** A free platform connecting small business owners with resources, including grants, loans, and mentorship opportunities. It's valuable for finding targeted funding options.
*   **SCORE:** A non-profit organization offering free business mentoring and workshops. Invaluable for gaining insights and guidance from experienced entrepreneurs.

So, what creative funding solutions have you used to bootstrap your business? What are some resources you've found helpful? Share your experiences and ask your questions in the comments below! Let's build each other up!

**Conclusion:**

Bootstrapping can be challenging, but it's also incredibly rewarding.

I also started seeing a lot of women who were diagnosed later in life. As a child I was a perfectionist and a straight A student, all the way through college. During college I procrastinated SO much and continue to do so.  I exceled in my early career, when I was in a very structured environment. I started working in my family business at age 25 and looking back, that's when my symptoms started showing up. I was always distracted, 20 tabs open at work, always wanting to start a new creative project, and having trouble finishing anything new I started. Jumped from hobby to hobby. When I got pregnant with my first child, I had just opened up a clothing store (major impulse decision). I was running all over the place and eventually burned out 4 years later. I just had my 2nd child about 6 months ago. I'm really struggling daily with all of my activities. I'm currently only working in the family business about 10 hours a week. When I'm there, I can't really get anything accomplished because I can't focus on a project. When I'm home with the baby, it's hard for me to even decide what to do in the morning! Make coffee, throw clothes in dryer, feed baby, lets the dogs out, the whole thing. I don't even know how I had the career and life I had in my 20s - I certainly don't have the discipline or focus now. Edited to add other symptoms - always late, impulsive shopping, fidgety. 



I met with a psychiatrist in August to seek diagnosis, the SPECT scan, extensive testing. The SPECT scans literally showed that I have the symptoms of an ADHD brain. He says that because I didn't have enough symptoms as a child, I can't be diagnosed with ADHD now. I think perhaps I learned from an early age how to mask the symptoms through perfectionism. Anyone else? He diagnosed me with the following:

Unspecified mood disorder

Frontal lobe and executive function deficit

Obsessive-compulsive behavior

Irritability and anger

Unspecified injury of head, sequla

He prescribed me lamotrigine and an array of supplements. I'm 6 weeks post starting this treatment plan and while my mood seems to have improved some, the focus hasn't improved at all and I am still struggling.

Do you have any suggestions or tips on if I should seek treatment/diagnosis from another Doctor?",1,1761575029.0,adhdwomen,6,1.0,False

I am still researching which espresso machine to buy to replace my BDB which became defective (water leaking and steam boiler constantly heating). I live alone and drink 90% espresso/American 10% milk drinks and entertain between 1 and 4 other coffee drinkers an average of every 2 weeks for board game sessions.

The more research I do on the Pro's vs Con's the more I am convinced that there is *nothing* out there that can touch the price/performance of a **Lelit Elizabeth** retailing locally to me for 1010EUR (1185USD)?

**PRO's:**

* Dual boiler with relatively fast heatup (15-20 mins to full stability) vs E61.
* Has great (unique for machines of this type?) pre-infusion options that include bloom.
* A ""proper"" hot water outlet that dispenses quickly at the right temperature.
* Great steam power.
* Cool-touch milk wand and hot water outlet.
* It has ""decent"" build quality and is made in Italy (caveats below) and not China.
* 1010 EUR is a crazily competitive price for all of the above.

**CON's:**

* Build quality has some rough edges... sharp edges and thin metal panels.
* The water tank design is bad and im surprised there is no aftermarket replacement available.
* Programming options are limited (no auto-on).
* v4 may be secretly around the corner?

**ALTERNATIVES:**

* The **BDB** is around 10% cheaper at 900EUR but has lots more plastic and is made in China (I prefer to buy as regional as is reasonable).
* The **Mara X** looks more 'classic' but is less programmable/configurable and costs 10% more at 1200 EUR.
* The **Profitec Move** is well-regarded but also a whopping 127% more expensive at 2300EUR! That is a lot to pay for better build quality.

**CONCLUSION:**

All of the above rationale makes the Lelit Elizabeth v3 seem like a bit of a no-brainer to me, but if anyone has any alternative options then I would love to hear it so I can just get some espresso back into my life. :D",3,1761574938.0,espresso,15,1.0,False

A:girlfriend/fiance/ex(31)
M-me(28)
S:girlfriends other partner(36)

Me and my ex met online in 2018 well call her A. We hit it off ,and really spent almost every single day together. 

Now things were really great, until we got our own place. All of a sudden, life isn’t good anymore. She self diagnosed herself with autism and a plethora of unconfirmed undiagnosed mental illnesses. I did my best to be a supportive boyfriend where I could. Helping her through symptoms and autistic meltdowns etc. 

Then she started getting into phases, first she had a sort of a hip hop street wear vibe, then it evolved to tomboyish clothes and then the dreaded kids clothes because she wanted to be what is called a “little” don’t get me started on how uncomfortable that phase was. She wanted to be treated like a child 24/7 so our sex life COMPLETELY evaporated as I was not comfortable with the person she was being at that stage. 

She eventually moved on from that. A and I had discussed polyamory in the past and we agreed that maybe it was something that would benefit our relationship. It didn’t. A was struggling finding “other partners” whereas I was meeting lots of people. A asked that I don’t engage in sexual activity until such a time we all met discussed boundaries and all those things. So I obliged and simply went on coffee dates and dinner dates. Eventually A starts meeting people and I’m happy for her. One day she has a girl she met over I was fine in another room just playing video games letting them enjoy their time. My single request was the same as hers. Refrain from sex until we have all met etc. I’m in the bedroom gaming and all of a sudden I hear moaning. I think in that moment I just kinda broke inside. She completely ignored and betrayed my trust and my 1 request to meet and set boundaries like she wanted. She made every excuse and I accepted it and let her gaslight me into believing it wasn’t cheating. This was the first time I think I knew something was up with her.

Fast forward to this past year. After all the phases, ups and downs, surgeries ,A tells me she is a lesbian but I am the 1 and only exception she would make. I’m obviously kinda devastated. I spent 7 years with someone who just settled for a guy because she couldn’t find a girl who would date her? I take it on the chin and move on. I realized that the whole poly thing was destroying me. I had success with the dating aspect I just was very much in love with A and really prioritized her over everyone so I stopped.

This last year my life literally completely imploded….When A met S everything and I mean everything went to crap.

A met S went on dates and would hang out every once in awhile. S eventually started being flirty with me and A liked that. They both employed a plan for S to sleep with me. I was home extremely sick from work and S messages me asking if she could come over to make me some soup and just make sure I’m doing ok. I accepted and she starts getting flirty over text. I tell her that it’s cute and nice of her but I’m too sick to be thinking bout those kinds of things. She comes over and is JUST pestering me to mess around over and over and over so finally I popped cold meds and gave in. Massive mistake. This solidified being a throuple and I didn’t even know it. 2 weeks later A TELLS me, no conversation no discussion that S is moving in. She already broke her lease. I freaked out a bit as we have a cramped 1 bedroom apartment. A whole entire 3rd person living there will be cramped af and it was. 

S is a bad person and I mean really bad. After she moved in she would have these extremely heated and angry conversations with A over me not doing enough. We split all household labor 50/50. Eventually S convinced me and A that, I was the cause of everything negative in our relationship, I was lazy and never did anything ,working 40hrs a week wasn’t contributing to finances enough. One day I finally broke and just thought ok I’m a man I’ll hunker down and do better. I took on ALL household chores and cleaning, I handled any and all household repairs either myself or requested the landlord fix it. After work my routine was: Make the bed, fold laundry(for 3 people), sweep, vacuum AND mop,run the new load of laundry, take out any trash, clean up living room, shower, 1hr of gaming and bed. It was brutal.S didn’t lift a finger when she moved in. The 1 thing she did was cook. And even that’s not great as everything was bland and she deep fried way too many things. She literally told me cooking dinner is her 1 chore because it’s so much work. Despite me being the one who does the dishes the cleanup etc. S would leave garbage everywhere too, candy wrappers,mugs, bowls with half eaten food, cups half drank and she would quite literally use the sink as a garbage can and would even run water normally even if the sink filled with dishes and already soggy garbage. She would get incredibly angry if I asked for help or said I needed a break that day and A believed it was all justified on S part. 

S was also a huge bully. She would CONSTANTLY berate me while I’d play some Marvel Rivals with my friends in the evenings. She’d be so incredibly annoying and just so genuinely nasty that my friends wouldn’t want to voice chat cause it was just her being a genuinely mean hearted person and ruining the good time. S would also constantly tell A everything I deal with is a lie. I do have diagnosed depression and ADHD. One night I could hear S imitating me and saying “Ohhh I’m M I have fake depression because I need attention way wah” A giggle and just I just broke down in the bathroom. There was 1 night where I was sobbing in bed because I was so overwhelmed. A and S started getting frisky RIGHT beside me knowing I was upset and the only one of us who had to get up for work the next day. S afterwards very rudely asked me if I was crying and I kinda knew she was a shitty person. This may not be allowed but I believe that S is a predator. She said in the car once “I love inc*st. If I had a son I would definitely fuck  him at 18” that blew my mind. I was so livid at that comment I saw red. 

The straws that broke the camels back was when A told me she was marrying S on our approaching wedding day and that she wanted to legally marry S and fake marry me on another random day. I knew then I was done. I couldn’t take any more of this nonsense. The worst part was when S assaulted me(S is VERY large). I came home from work and she grabbed me by the neck hard as I walked in and pinned me against the door. I genuinely thought she was attacking me . I was pinned against the door, actually thinking I was going to be hurt or injured for no reason. S tried to force me to look at her and I wouldn’t, she then started kissing my neck while I was pinned and it was the most incredibly violating thing I’ve ever experienced. I tried to tell A and when I did she gaslit me into believing it was just something fun and sexy S wanted to do and I should’ve been ok with it cause I’m a switch. My own fiancé told me my sexual assault was just a fun thing her partner wanted to do with me my heart shattered.

I broke up with A. She hasn’t taken it well. She is constantly posting instagrams that I am a narcissistic abuser and has claimed that every instance of sex in our relationship is retroactively rape. A says that I’ve torn our “family”(we don’t have kids)apart because I couldn’t give her more. So AITAH for breaking up with my gf of seven years?",0,1761574875.0,AITAH,6,0.5,False
