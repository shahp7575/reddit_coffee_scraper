What I can‚Äôt seem to grasp is, with the plethora  of coffee shops popping up here, why does a single one of them never open before 9am? I‚Äôve lived in other parts of the city and almost everywhere else has a decent coffee shop open at a normal time. I‚Äôve also worked in plenty coffee shops when I was a student and it almost seems idiotic from a business point of view to not open during what I would‚Äôve considered ‚Äúpeak times‚Äù (7/8am). 

It‚Äôs really frustrating as a commuter because with the amount of people that flood that train at Queens Park, I know for a fact coffee shops round here would make a killing in the morning.

Anyway, rant over - just seems really stupid to me, especially from certain business that moan about no one buying their coffee when they don‚Äôt open during commuting hours and are right next to a train station :))  ",1,1750141105.0,glasgow,0,1.0,False

1ldfo97,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1ldfo97/what_happened_to_america/,What happened to America?,"People keep asking, ‚ÄúWhat happened to America?‚Äù
Did it stop standing for freedom and democracy?
It‚Äôs a real tragedy.
Because as everyone knows, America used to be the global supplier of freedom.

Just ask the Native Americans.
They were introduced to freedom through modern civilization, forced migration, and smallpox.
Then came slavery, to be fair, was a strong economic foundation.
So strong, in fact, that it eventually allowed America to afford abolition.
That‚Äôs called long-term planning.

In the Philippines, freedom was imported straight from Spain via American intervention.
And then held in a storage unit for a few decades,
just to make sure the locals didn't mess it up.

America helped end World War II by introducing nuclear liberty to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Quick, efficient, unmistakably democratic.

Later, in Latin America, freedom showed up wearing sunglasses and a CIA badge.
Democracy might‚Äôve been elected,
but America knew what the region really needed:
military coups, death squads, and just enough capitalism to keep the coffee flowing.

Iran almost fell into socialism in 1953, but America saved the day,
by reinstalling a monarchy.
Because what screams ""people's freedom"" like a royal dictatorship?

Vietnam was another close call.
Millions died, but freedom almost made it.
A valiant effort.

Iraq?
Well, who wouldn‚Äôt want to be bombed into democracy?
Freedom came, saw, and destabilized.

And Libya,
Gaddafi was a brutal man, no doubt.
Luckily, freedom came again.
Today, Libya is a thriving hub of‚Ä¶ open-air slave markets.
Progress.

America also helps maintain peace by selling weapons to nearly every region on fire.
Yemen, Israel, Saudi Arabia ‚Äî
it‚Äôs all part of the grand strategy called ‚Äúregional stability.‚Äù

At home, America defends liberty through mass incarceration, police militarization,
and choosing not to give people healthcare 
because true freedom means dying with options.

Global economic freedom?
That‚Äôs the IMF‚Äôs job.
Just lend poor nations money with strings attached,
cut public services, raise debt and boom.
Freedom via austerity.

And let‚Äôs not forget the great protector of liberty: Israel 
the Middle East‚Äôs only democracy*,
(*with caveats for occupation, checkpoints, walls, and stateless millions).
America ensures this beacon stays bright, with billions in annual aid,
advanced weapons, and ironclad veto power.

So when people say,
‚ÄúAmerica has changed. It doesn‚Äôt stand for freedom anymore,‚Äù
you have to wonder...

Did it change?
Or did we just stop believing the stop believing the story?

Because the story never changed.
Only the mask got tired.

Now that the mask has slipped.
We have a choice:
Keep pretending -
or start rebuilding something real

First of all, sorry for the broken English‚Äîit‚Äôs not my first language.

So, in late October 2024, my(21F) boyfriend(20M) of 3.5 years left me after a shitty (and I mean¬†*Chernobyl-toxic*¬†level shitty) year where we were constantly fighting over a girl. She was new in his class and apparently didn‚Äôt know anyone, so he went to talk to her‚Äîwhich was a big deal for him because he‚Äôs always been the shy type. His friends started teasing him, saying he was into this girl. I found out and got jealous (not the first time, but probably the one I handled best). The jokes kept escalating, to the point where his friends were suggesting he wanted to cheat on me with her. I asked him to please tell them to stop because it made me uncomfortable, and he said he couldn‚Äôt do anything about it, because that would only make the jokes worse.

After two months of this, he started lying occasionally. The first time I found out, he said he was with his friends when he was actually having lunch alone with her‚ÄîI found out because I wanted to surprise him. I told him I wanted to break up, because I‚Äôve always said jealousy is¬†*my*¬†issue but it affects both of us, and that I could manage it if we stayed honest. He promised it wouldn‚Äôt happen again and said he‚Äôd go low-contact with her.

Two months later, he started talking to her again‚Äîbehind my back, obviously. When I confronted him, he told me I couldn‚Äôt control who he talked to. And while that‚Äôs true, it had actually been¬†*his*¬†idea to cut contact with her in the first place‚ÄîI never asked for it. I reminded him we made a compromise and he couldn‚Äôt just back out of it without saying anything.

This situation went on for a whole year and completely destroyed my mental health and libido. For our anniversary, I didn‚Äôt want to do anything intimate, but I felt pressured (not physically, but I knew he‚Äôd get upset if we didn‚Äôt). So I pretended I was into it, but he noticed and got mad anyway. In the summer, things didn‚Äôt improve. When we went back to Uni in September, the same cycle repeated every night: he initiated, I wasn‚Äôt in the mood, and he‚Äôd get upset. Once, he even told me I was doing it to punish him‚Äîwhich I swear I wasn‚Äôt. I just didn‚Äôt want to force myself. Then he‚Äôd start a 15‚Äì20 minute conversation asking me if I didn‚Äôt find him attractive anymore, if I had a medical issue, etc. When I told him the whole situation had affected me deeply, he said I was exaggerating. This happened every single night. And sometimes, when I was half-asleep, he tried again, and I guess I was more vulnerable or receptive, so I gave in‚Äîthis happened two or three times. I still don‚Äôt understand it fully.

In early October, I found out they were talking again, and I told him that if he wanted to be friends with her, fine‚Äîbut he couldn‚Äôt do that and also be with me. I couldn‚Äôt handle another year like that (my grades had dropped massively). He said he‚Äôd explain things to her, but I told him I didn‚Äôt trust him to do that honestly. I know that was kind of shitty of me, but I was at a breaking point and didn‚Äôt handle it well.

Two weeks later, we had a fight and he broke up with me. I cried, begged him not to leave me, but nothing worked. I was absolutely devastated‚Äîespecially when I found out that¬†*the very next day*¬†he went to a coffee shop with her to talk about all the details of our relationship (those that made¬†*him*¬†look like the victim, in his own words). I was mentally on the verge. It was my first relationship, and it was long and toxic.

Two more weeks went by. He broke up with me¬†*again*, this time over text. I lost 12 kg in that time‚ÄîI was like an anxious plant. I couldn‚Äôt function, I could barely breathe. Then, one Sunday evening, we bumped into each other at the bus station (we lived separately but used to spend every night together). We spent the whole 2.5-hour bus ride talking. It felt like old times. He even walked me home. When we got to my door, he kissed me. In my delusional state, I thought maybe he wanted to get back together. I told him we needed to talk first, but he said we could talk later‚Äîand then we had sex.

Five minutes after, he told me he liked this girl and didn‚Äôt want to get back together.

That obviously crushed me even more. Still, I kept hoping we‚Äôd get back together for another month. During that time, I developed a nervous fever and had to be hospitalized. He kept breaking no-contact every three weeks, which was killing me. After kissing me on the 29th and then saying he wanted to go NC on the 31st at 9:30 p.m., I said okay. But then, at 00:01 on New Year‚Äôs, he texted me ‚ÄúHappy New Year.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what broke inside me, but I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, so I didn‚Äôt reply.

I stayed in no-contact for a month. During that time, he kept texting me, asking when he could come get his stuff (mind you, he‚Äôd had¬†*two whole months*¬†to do that, but only brought it up after I went NC). He even threatened to call the police. Eventually, I let him come get his things. I didn‚Äôt ignore his messages to punish him‚ÄîI just needed some stability before letting him walk all over me again.

Anyway, time has passed and I thought I was healing, but lately I‚Äôve been feeling all this frustration build back up. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him‚Äînot in a missing-him way, but the memories keep popping up. Last week I found a Reddit post he wrote saying that the girl he left me for had told him she wasn‚Äôt interested. He said she was ‚Äúthe best human he‚Äôs ever known‚Äù and that he‚Äôd rather stay friends than lose her completely. He even said that if she gets a boyfriend one day, he‚Äôll have to cut things off because that would be ‚Äúinappropriate.‚Äù Like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs only inappropriate when¬†*he‚Äôs*¬†not the one in a relationship? lol.

I don‚Äôt know. I feel so frustrated. I know I did some bad things in that relationship too, and I‚Äôm still working through my own issues and healing from the trauma. But I can‚Äôt help feeling like it‚Äôs unfair‚Äîhe‚Äôs out there chasing another girl since week two and I‚Äôm the one stuck dealing with all this pain.

Do you know any way to get rid of all this anger or to heal properly without looking back? I want to feel normal and not damaged again :(

Sorry for the long post‚Äîit‚Äôs already summarized, but I still write a lot hahahaha. If you have any questions, just let me know. I‚Äôll answer gladly.

|**What are Wild Foods?**|

Wild foods, also known as foraged foods, are plants and fungi harvested from their natural, uncultivated environments. Throughout human history, wild foods were the [primary](https://www.thehomeprepper.com/book#aff=CoryMalone) source of sustenance. Before agriculture dominated, our ancestors relied entirely on their knowledge of the land to find edible plants, fruits, nuts, seeds, and mushrooms. This intimate relationship with nature shaped their cultures, traditions, and even their physiology.

Today, with readily available groceries, wild foods offer a unique opportunity to reconnect with our heritage and experience the abundance of the natural world. It's more than just finding food; it's about understanding ecosystems, appreciating biodiversity, and rediscovering a lost connection.

||
||
|**Key Benefits of Incorporating Wild Foods**|

Beyond the novelty, [wild foods ](https://www.thehomeprepper.com/book#aff=CoryMalone)offer a wealth of advantages:

* **Nutrient Density:** Wild plants often boast higher concentrations of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants than their cultivated counterparts. Growing in diverse and challenging environments forces them to produce more phytonutrients for survival.
* **Chemical-Free:** Foraged foods are naturally free from synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers used in conventional agriculture. You're consuming food in its purest form.
* **Sustainability:** Responsible foraging promotes sustainable harvesting practices, minimizing environmental impact. By understanding plant life cycles and avoiding over-collection, we can ensure these resources remain available for future generations.
* **Connection to Nature:** Foraging encourages exploration, observation, and a deeper understanding of local ecosystems. You'll learn to identify plants in their natural habitats, appreciate seasonal changes, and develop a stronger sense of place.
* **Culinary Adventure:** Wild foods add exciting and unique flavors to your meals. From the peppery bite of wild mustard to the earthy aroma of foraged mushrooms, these ingredients offer a culinary journey beyond the ordinary.

||
||
|**Examples of Wild Foods**|

||
||
|**Dandelions:** Leaves, flowers, and roots are all edible. Leaves are great in salads, flowers can be fried, and roots can be roasted for a coffee substitute. **Wild Berries:** Blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries grow wild in many regions. Be *absolutely* sure of your identification, as some berries are poisonous. **Mushrooms:** A vast and diverse category, but requires expert knowledge for safe identification. Some edible varieties include morels, chanterelles, and oyster mushrooms. **Never consume a mushroom unless you are 100% sure of its identity!** **Nettles:** Stinging nettles are incredibly nutritious when cooked, losing their sting in the process. Use gloves when harvesting! **Wild Garlic (Ramsons):** A delicious garlicky herb that grows in woodlands. Use the leaves raw or cooked.|**Purslane:** A succulent plant with a slightly sour, lemony taste, it's a great addition to salads and stir-fries. **Cattails:** The roots, shoots, and pollen are all edible at different times of the year. **Seaweed:** Various types of seaweed are edible and nutritious, offering a salty, umami flavor. Common examples are nori and kelp. **Clover:** Both the leaves and flowers are edible and have a mild, slightly sweet flavor. Add them to salads or use them as a garnish. **Rose Hips:** The fruit of the rose plant, they are a great source of vitamin C and can be used to make tea, jam, or syrup.|

||
||
|**A Word of Caution: Safety First!**|

**Safety is paramount** when foraging. **Never consume any plant or fungus unless you are 100% certain of its identification.** Cross-reference with multiple[ reliable sources ](https://www.thehomeprepper.com/book#aff=CoryMalone)and, if possible, consult with an experienced forager or botanist.

* **Start with easily identifiable plants.**
* **Avoid foraging in polluted areas** (e.g., near roadsides or industrial sites).
* **Be aware of potential look-alikes** (poisonous plants that resemble edible ones).
* **Respect private property and local foraging regulations.**
* **Harvest sustainably,** leaving enough for the plant to regenerate and for wildlife to consume.
* **When trying a new wild food, eat only a small amount at first** to check for any allergic reactions.

||
||
|**Embrace the Wild**|

Exploring the world of wild foods opens a door to a richer, more connected relationship with nature and our past. By embracing the bounty of the wild, we can nourish our bodies, expand our culinary horizons, and cultivate a deeper appreciation for the natural world. Start slowly, prioritize safety, and enjoy the journey of discovery. [Happy foraging](https://www.thehomeprepper.com/book#aff=CoryMalone)!",1,1750139980.0,u_mogul9,0,1.0,False

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work! 

Here are some icebreakers: 

* What do you enjoy watching?
* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural? 
* Do you collect anything?
* What's a deal breaker for you in a friendship? 
* How do you like spending your time? 
* Do you have any pets?

One of the first beans I‚Äôve actually been able to articulate the chocolate flavor without much effort. The beans resembled a VERY dark roast. After speaking with the roaster they informed me that it was actually a very light roast and became dark during the 200 hours of processing.

So, a few years back I started messing around with fiction and fanfic, and at some point, I thought‚Äîokay, time to try writing a full book, as i realy enjoy writing. But then I hit a wall. I realized I kinda suck at just letting things *flow*‚Äîlike, building a world as I go and not overthinking every step.

Someone told me a good way to practice that is by writing short horror stories. And weirdly enough, I really got into it. What started as ‚Äúwriting practice‚Äù became something I genuinely enjoy, so I‚Äôve been sharing some of my creepy stories online lately.

I still have a few older ones that are darker and more gore-heavy, but I feel like I need to go back and rewrite them eventually‚Äîonce I get more feedback, and after reading more from others in the horror community.

Lately, I‚Äôve been using this system I made for myself: I created a list of a bunch of descriptive keywords and put it in a macro that selects them at random, and i need to write a story that matches them. One of the recent combos I got  now was:   
**slow-burn, domestic, existential, light, atmospheric, unsettling, no-shock, melancholic, intimate**

Now this is a bit of a weird mix, and i did write a story on it, but i would realy appreciate the feedback on is this - it? does it grab this descriptors, and how does the story sound in general? Does this catch your interest? Does it sound and feel off? Thanks in advance, and looking forward to learning from you all!

# I Feed the Thing That Lives With Me

I just moved in. The apartment hunt was mental. Rents went way up from my uni days when I was last hunting for them. I finally found a nice cozy apartment I could have, even though I never met the actual owner... after searching for a while, I just stopped and decided to ask in every call if they got anything cheaper... and finally, this one guy did.

He just said:¬†*""Hey, actually, I do, I have this place but no one actually stays in it for long, and it‚Äôs a fixer-upper, so you can have it for 180 a month.""*¬†This worked for me.

He sent me the contract via email and left the keys in a postbox... which was super weird. But everything seemed legit, and it works for me because... well...I don‚Äôt talk to people anymore, I dont like to talk to people. I dont like...people. It didn‚Äôt happen all at once‚Äîno dramatic falling out or grand isolation. Just a quiet slipping away. Messages stopped. Calls dried up. The kind of silence that grows naturally when no one bothers to fight for friendships anymore... And maybe I stopped fighting too. I just needed to get away from everything, it was exhausting me. The fake smiles I needed to wear for every dinner, event, or any social gathering.... I just realized I‚Äôm better off being alone, without needing to fake my state of mind. And it finally worked, I was finally at peace,

\-""happy"".-

The apartment is small. Two rooms. I know now why it is so cheap - the heat doesn‚Äôt work and the hallway light‚Äôs been flickering since I moved in. The landlord doesn‚Äôt care, and neither do I. I keep the curtains drawn. I cook what I can afford. I don‚Äôt look in the mirror much, and I don‚Äôt really care about it, I‚Äôm not a social person, and.... I don‚Äôt go out much. Issue is - I also do not sleep well. I always had an issue with that, so most nights I just spend on the couch, watching Netflix, followed by a morning coffee and back to the day at hand. There‚Äôs even a worn spot on the couch cushion that fits me perfectly. That‚Äôs my place now.

But there is also one thing I didn‚Äôt mention. There, in the corner. It‚Äôs the far left one, just behind the bookshelf I never finished unpacking. I use the boxes of books as chairs at this point. That‚Äôs where it stays. I didn‚Äôt notice it at first. When I first moved in I just lived in the chaos. The idea was to just sort things out as I go. At first I thought it was a pile of laundry I‚Äôd forgotten to sort, but when I tried to move it, my hand passed through something soft that resisted‚Äîlike pressing into a pillow that pushes back, except colder. Damp, maybe. It didn‚Äôt make sense. But since I was lacking sleep for basically my whole life, the idea of my mind playing tricks on me wasn‚Äôt really new.

\-So I left it.-

The next day it was sitting a little straighter. I think. The shape was still low to the ground, maybe two feet tall at best, like a lump with no real features, but now it had... posture? That was the first time I looked at it for more than a second. It didn‚Äôt seem like anything much really, it was like a weird ragdoll-ish stuffed bear to keep me company. In a strange way, it made the room feel less empty.  
I started calling it Mop. Not because it looked like one, exactly‚Äîmore because I didn‚Äôt know what else to name a small, lumpy presence in the corner that just‚Ä¶ sat there, and didn‚Äôt go away. At this point I figured, maybe it's not just in my mind, it‚Äôs there, for a while now. I just kind of got used to it through ignoring it for most of the time. I just shrugged it, and whatever it is, it beats a plant - People talking to plants are weird. Mop didn‚Äôt react to its name, but I found myself talking to it anyway. Like a roommate I wasn‚Äôt sure existed. ‚ÄúHey, Mop. You eat dreams or just leftover sadness?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúI dropped spaghetti on the floor. That‚Äôs your problem now.‚Äù The more I joked, the more I felt like... like it was listening.

\-I'm probably losing my mind again.-

One night, I left a slice of toast on a napkin near the corner. Not out of fear‚Äîmore like a joke... a joke of realization I was a sad guy with no one to talk to but a few rags in the corner. I said, ‚ÄúHere. Freeloaders get crumbs.‚Äù The next morning, the toast was gone. Napkin too. No crumbs, no mess. Nothing.  
It wasn‚Äôt mice, I got rid of those when I moved in, as well as patched the holes in the walls. That was the first time I understood that maybe...just maybe....it could actually.... move? I didn‚Äôt panic. I wasn‚Äôt even surprised. I think a part of me had already accepted that Mop was real before I wanted to say it out loud. And more than that‚Äîit was staying. I didn‚Äôt mind. It wasn‚Äôt hurting anything. If anything, it made the space feel a little less empty, a little less lonely. It was a crazy guy's imaginary friend that replaces normal people‚Äôs companions... like dogs, cats... or cactus. And... I shrugged and just kept feeding it leftovers.

\-‚ÄúA dog,‚Äù I said to myself, ‚Äúit‚Äôs basically, kind of... a weird... dog.‚Äù and shrugged.-

As the days passed, it started to change. Not drastically. Just small shifts. It would be closer to the couch some mornings, or perched slightly higher like it had grown an inch overnight, it was weird. Its shape got a little smoother, a little more defined, like a melted snowman slowly reforming. At some point, I noticed it had two soft-looking stubs‚Äîlike arms? No fingers. Just rounded bumps like plush limbs sewn onto a stuffed animal. Am I losing my mind? Am actualy falling a sleep and sleepwalking? Eating leftovers and sewing laundry parts onto a... sewn together bunch of laundry?

Then ‚Äì then it was the first time it moved while I was looking. I had just come back from a walk, an errand i had to run - soaked in rain and sick with exhaustion. I collapsed onto the couch without a word, face down into a pillow. After a few minutes, I felt something nudge against my shin. Not hard‚Äîjust a bump. When I opened my eyes, Mop was a few inches closer than it had been. Its little arms were drawn in like a child hugging its knees. It looked... concerned. I didn‚Äôt move. Just whispered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt reply. But it didn‚Äôt leave, either. I'm going mental again, I'm imagining things again... but, then it blinked. I jumped, gasped, and then, I don‚Äôt really know... I just kind of... accepted that I am going crazy? I am not sure‚Äîam I going crazy? But if I am crazy, I might just as well accept it and go on, it‚Äôs not like anyone will notice it... From then on, it followed me from room to room. Always in the corner. Always where it wouldn‚Äôt be seen from the windows. Sometimes I‚Äôd catch it staring‚Äînot in a threatening way, more like a dog watching its owner with quiet focus. I‚Äôd eat dinner, and Mop would be nearby. I‚Äôd read in bed, and Mop would be tucked in the corner, faintly rocking side to side. This went on for a while. I guess I do have a pet. I just can't... walk it... or show it... who would I show it to anyway? And why would I walk it...

\-This suits me.-

I didn‚Äôt feed it every day. But when I did, the food always disappeared. Then... It started purring. Or something like purring. A low, rhythmic hum that filled the room like the inside of a seashell. I guess it‚Äôs not a dog, I guess I'm a cat person after all. And I just accepted it again. It‚Äôs a weird-ass cat. Yes. It also makes sense as it didn‚Äôt really like to touch or to be touched... cats are assholes. But then it would cuddle next to me... Weird-ass cat. \**sigh\**¬†. I‚Äôd be halfway through a sentence, reading some old fantasy novel out loud, and it would start vibrating gently, like it was pleased. It was cute, in a strange way. Like a cat. I really do need to define it, it‚Äôs weird I redefine it every so often. Yes, this is final... it‚Äôs a cat... a cat with no mouth and too many thoughts, but it‚Äôs a cat. My cat. My weird, creepy, strange, cat.

One night, I had a breakdown. No real reason. Not that I needed one, not that it was so uncommon... but it was... more than usual. Just the accumulation of things‚Äîlife, memory, a crushing sense of uselessness. I sat on the bathroom floor with the lights off, crying into my sleeves, and for the first time in months, I wanted someone‚Äîanyone‚Äîto knock on the door. Someone to care.

\-Instead, something warm touched my back. I turned slowly.-

Mop was there, pressed against the frame, just barely tall enough to reach me. One stubby arm rested on my shoulder. It didn‚Äôt feel slimy or heavy. Just soft. Solid. Like someone small trying to comfort someone falling apart. It was so fragile, so gentle, I didn‚Äôt say anything. I didn‚Äôt need to. I just leaned into it. I think it stayed there all night. Then I realized it cared for me far more than I cared for...¬†*it.?*¬†I was dismissing it, not even admitting it was there on a daily basis, still feeding it as a joke.... sometimes I just kicked it out of the way, and it just curled into a corner. But... From that day on, I fed it daily. Real meals. Bowls with broth, bits of chicken, steamed rice. Sometimes eggs. I always made more and made sure to share with it. And it never left a trace. I started leaving out books too. Mop never opened them, but I think it liked the idea of stories. I‚Äôd read aloud while it listened, swaying gently or curling tighter when the characters were in danger. This gentle little thing that I couldn‚Äôt explain. What if I told someone? Would someone take it away as a wild animal? But it wasn‚Äôt an animal... it was... rags? I still don‚Äôt know what it is, but I knew I had to take care of it.

It never made a sound. Not once. But I never doubted it understood me. I stopped thinking of it as a thing or a creature. It was just... Mop. My Mop.

Then one day, one strange day, if \*STRANGE\* can be described as different at this point, someone probably decided it‚Äôs worth checking that lone lighted apartment in an otherwise pretty empty building. I heard breaking in the main entrance door with a crowbar, I heard steps coming up, squeaking floorboards.... It was around midnight. I was awake, reading on the couch, Mop curled in its corner with an apple in a bowl beside it. The lock rattled once. Then again.

**-A heavy, deliberate push followed. -**

Someone on the other side whispered something I couldn‚Äôt make out.  
I froze. I didn‚Äôt have anything to defend myself with. No bat. No knife. My phone was across the room, and my legs wouldn‚Äôt move. As defunct as I am, this scared me out of my mind. A sudden flash of clarity, or reality ‚Äì I am in danger?

The door creaked open. Just a few inches. Enough to see a foot‚Äîbooted. Heavy. Then a hand wearing leather gloves pushed it further and a man stepped into the room. Pale. Blank-eyed. A black hoodie. I am not sure what he came for, but I guess he saw me... or the place as easy pickings on whatever he could get. People get by how they can‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt frantic like you'd expect, just... there, like breaking into homes was his shift, and I was just his task for this night.... there is no rest for the wicked.

He didn‚Äôt speak. He didn‚Äôt demand money. He just raised a long kitchen knife and stepped forward. I guess he didn‚Äôt expect me to be there. Or awake. I couldn‚Äôt even scream.

Then Mop moved. As scared as I was, my mind now focused on how I need to save him! He was helpless, I needed to do something, I needed to protect him somehow! But then Mop moved slightly forward again. It didn‚Äôt leap. It didn‚Äôt make a sound. It just...

\-**unfolded-.**

It grew taller, not in the way things stretch, but like a shadow deepening, if I can describe it in this way. Its shape swelled until it filled half the room, like its devouring walls... like growing over the walls, eyes opening where no eyes had been, and more... and more, every wall turned into a black shadow with more eyes than I could count‚Äîglowing faintly like stars in deep fog. Its stubby arms became wings or veils or something in between, I froze, no... I was paralyzed! It didn‚Äôt move, it didn't attack.  
It simply¬†**-was-.**

The man stopped mid-step, looking around him, looking up, while his knife hit the floor. He was terrified. He tried to turn, but the room¬†**-bent-**¬†around him. The shadow covered his legs up to his waist, the light grew dim and sharp all at once. The air folded inward like a vacuum closing, like reality was twisting into a point, and then¬†**-darkness-**.... for a moment that felt like forever, and the next moment - he was gone.  
\-No sound. No scream. No trace. As if the world had corrected a mistake.-

Mop shrank back to its original size, curled into its old shape and rolled quietly into the corner like nothing had happened. I sat on the couch and sat there for hours, unable to move. I didn‚Äôt ask what it was. I didn‚Äôt need to. I didn‚Äôt know, but nothing can explain this, nothing could, nothing needed to.... It had chosen to protect me.

The next morning, the bowl was empty, and Mop blinked up at me.

\-**It smiled.-**

Not with a mouth, it had none, but with its entire being. A soft warmth radiated from it like a hug held at a distance. I think it was proud of itself. And I...I wasn't afraid of Mop. Not of Mop. Not really.  
I was afraid of what I didn‚Äôt understand. Afraid of what it had the power to become‚Äîand the fact that it chose not to. It could have unmade the world if it wanted to. Bend reality to its will.  
But it didn‚Äôt. It stayed small. Kind. Patient. Quiet.

It let me talk down to it. Let me feed it like a pet. Let me insult it, laugh at it, ignore it on bad days, even kicked it. It accepted all of it. Because it wanted to stay. And I don‚Äôt know why it chose me. But I don't know what would‚Äôve happened if it hadn‚Äôt.

So I feed it now. Properly. Lovingly. I clean the bowls now, even though I do not understand how it feeds. I speak gently. I read with feeling. I never leave it alone for too long. And when I have bad nights, I let it curl up near my bed, just out of sight.

Not because it needs me.  
But because it‚Äôs choosing not to need more.  
*Because it‚Äôs choosing to be small.*  
Because it let me live

I'm about 210 pounds at the moment (not sure what that is in stone, sorry, and probably don't want to know tbh!) at 5'4 and know I need to lose weight but I just can't face the diets I used to do. I used to rely on shake diets or just very low cal eating but I can't do it. I don't have it in me. The will power has left the building! Prob the energy as well - I can't be starving and looking after three kids, lol.

Anyway, I came across a story about The Britalian Diet a few weeks ago and have been umming and ahhing but finally bought the book a few days ago. Has anyone else followed it? I did have a look and couldn't find any threads (sorry if ive missed one!) 

It's based on Italian eating and their habits, and the recipes are my kind of thing. You can still eat carbs and have wine and desserts and not as strict as what I've done in the past. You still count calories but it is cycling, which I've never done before. 1400 per day on average so some days are higher and others are lower. 

Anyway, it's day one today and I'm sat with a milky coffee and a mini croissant! So far, so good....

I'm going to try and check in here every week to keep me accountable. Wish me luck and please tag me if you're following it as well! Would be good to have some friends doing the same plan!",2,1750139298.0,loseit,4,1.0,False

1ldfeca,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1ldfeca/tips_for_saving_money/,Tips for saving money,"Building financial security isn't about drastic sacrifices - it's about smart systems that make saving effortless. Recent behavioral economics research reveals fascinating insights about how ordinary people can build extraordinary savings.

https://preview.redd.it/flalmbm2se7f1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f95f67a7cc489e800341b809fd94658f13b65fdd



1. The Power of Micro-Saving



A 2023 University of Tokyo study found that participants who saved small amounts daily (¬•500/\~$3.50) accumulated 37% more than those who attempted large monthly deposits. The secret? Consistent micro-actions create habit loops in the basal ganglia.



Real-life example:

Indonesian street vendor Mbak Siti saved Rp 10,000 ($0.70) daily in a locked wooden box. After 3 years, she opened a small grocery store that now earns 5x her previous income.



Try this:

\- Use apps that round up purchases to save spare change

\- Start with just $1/day in a separate account



2. The 24-Hour Rule for Impulse Spending



Neuroscientists at McGill University discovered that waiting just one day before non-essential purchases reduces spending by 64%. The prefrontal cortex needs time to override emotional buying impulses.



Success story:

Brazilian graphic designer Tiago Nunes implemented a ""sleep on it"" rule for purchases over R$100 (\~$20). He saved R$18,000 in 18 months - enough to launch his freelance business.



Pro tip:

\- Keep a ""maybe list"" for desired items

\- After 24 hours, evaluate if you still need/want it



3. The Visibility Principle



A Cambridge University experiment showed that people who visualized their savings goals daily progressed 42% faster. The occipital lobe activates motivation centers when we ""see"" future rewards.



Inspiring case:

Nigerian teacher Adeola Okeke created a vision board showing her dream home. By posting savings milestones on her fridge, she bought land within 5 years.



Action steps:

\- Make your savings goal visible (phone wallpaper, screensaver)

\- Track progress with colorful charts



4. The Meal Prep Advantage



Research from the University of S√£o Paulo revealed that cooking at home just 4x/week saves an average of $1,872 annually. Bulk cooking triggers the brain's efficiency-seeking behavior.



Real-world proof:

Korean office worker Ji-hoon Kim batch-cooked every Sunday. He saved ‚Ç©2.4 million (\~$1,800) in a year while eating healthier.



Easy start:

\- Master 3 simple, scalable recipes

\- Invest in quality storage containers



5. The Social Savings Effect



A London School of Economics study found that people in savings accountability groups save 28% more than solo savers. Mirror neurons make us mimic financial behaviors in our social circles.



Powerful example:

Mexican nurses Carmen and Luisa started a biweekly savings challenge. Their friendly competition helped both save over MXN $50,000 (\~$2,800) in 2 years.



How to begin:

\- Find a savings buddy

\- Set joint check-ins



6. The Automation Advantage



MIT researchers determined that automated savings increase success rates by 82%. Removing decision fatigue lets the brain's autopilot work for you.



Proven method:

Egyptian engineer Youssef Hassan set up automatic transfers matching his coffee expenses ($4/day ‚Üí $120/month). He saved $6,000 in 5 years without feeling it.



Simple setup:

\- Schedule transfers right after payday

\- Start with just 3-5% of income



7. The Skill-Investment Loop



Data from the University of Cape Town shows that every dollar spent on learning money-making skills yields $17 in lifetime returns. The brain's neuroplasticity thrives on skill acquisition.



Transformational story:

Filipina call center agent Maria Santos spent 6 months' savings on copywriting courses. She now earns triple her previous salary freelancing.



Wise investment:

\- Identify one high-value skill in your field

\- Allocate savings specifically for this education



Small Steps, Big Results



As demonstrated by a 10-year Global Savings Initiative study:

‚úìThose who start with tiny, consistent actions out-save ""big effort"" savers 3:1

‚úìThe average person wastes $2,340 annually on preventable small expenses

‚úì89% of successful savers credit systems over willpower



Your financial freedom begins with the first dollar saved today. Remember - wealth isn't about your income, but your systems.

He's actively looking to acquire SaaS businesses with $1K+ MRR.

Why He's Expanding His Book:

He told me his current portfolio is doing well, but he wants to diversify across more niches. ""I'd rather own 10 small profitable businesses than bet everything on 2-3 bigger ones.""

Makes sense when you think about it.

His Advice for Sellers:

""If you're actually ready to sell, have your numbers ready, be honest about what works and what doesn't, and price it fairly. The right buyer will move fast.""

Why I'm Sharing This:

Figured this perspective might be useful for founders who've built something and are wondering if there's actually a market for smaller SaaS businesses.

I am flying into LAX at the butt crack of dawn on a Friday and I fly out Sunday afternoon. The concert is Saturday night. I am trying to plan this trip to make the most out of my stay. I am at a loss with where to stay and what to do. I have looked at 100s of hotels and Airbnb‚Äôs. There‚Äôs too much and I suck at planning. My original plan was to fly in early and go to Disneyland for the day on Friday. I don‚Äôt really want to stay near Anaheim just because I am bringing my luggage with me and check in for most places is after 4pm. I am not renting a car but I am open to it, if it is more cost effective but I am not necessarily worried about the money. My plan was to uber to Disneyland and use a bouncer to store my luggage and then uber to my place around 6-7pm to check in shower rest. If I‚Äôm feeling up to it I‚Äôll probably get dinner out or just DoorDash/Postmates food. The following day (Saturday: day of the concert) I would love to wake up and hike some or go for a run to a local coffee shop. I‚Äôm open to hiking around the observatory if I stay close by if not I just want to stay somewhere safe where I can run or walk to breakfast. I would love to spend a couple hours leading up to the concert at either the beach or a pool. I am from the other LA so I am used to HOT HUMID weather and warm water this time of year. I can tolerate the cold but I was told the beaches are gross and not the safest for a solo female. I think another option would be to stay somewhere with a pool or use resort pass for a day to use a local hotel pool and sip drinks before I return to my place to get ready. The concert is at 8:30pm and I want to get there early like 7-7:30pm. Where should I stay and if yall absolutely think that Disneyland is too much and I should save for another trip, then what should I do? Bonus points for local food recommendations. Also I have zero interest in doing touristy things like the walk of fame. I‚Äôm more of a hike and see the sights kind of girl. I do like museums and big history buff. Please help.

The problem is the front buttons‚Äîthe start button and the cups/shot button‚Äîonly work sometimes. Doesn‚Äôt matter how hard or soft I press them, they just won‚Äôt respond most of the time. Every now and then they‚Äôll randomly work again. It‚Äôs super inconsistent.

The grind time dial (the small one on the front) also doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything at all. But the grind size dial on the side works fine, and the display powers on like normal.

Feels like it might be something electrical, like a bad contact, dirty button, or maybe something on the board? I haven‚Äôt opened it up yet but I‚Äôm comfortable with soldering and repairs if needed.

I attached a video showing one of the rare times the cups/shot and start buttons actually respond. If anyone‚Äôs had this issue before or knows where I should start, I‚Äôd really appreciate the help.

What else do you do to feel a bit like yourself own self? I am starting to go on walks and starting to accept my pp body and finding outfits to accordingly has been an interesting pastime when nap trapped..

Been living with a half-furnished bedroom for a while and looking for some advice. 

Seeking headboards and bedside tables. Sturdy, wooden, NOT modern, midcentury/vintage vibes. 

Not looking for Mr Price, decofurn, or anything of those likes. I hate how every half decent bedside table seems to have black-painted or metal legs. I saw something I liked at @home but it would‚Äôve been R15K for the pair. I like my coricraft sofa, but the other furniture is too ‚Äúfarmhouse‚Äù for my tastes. 

Tried a handful of vintage/second hand places but the hidden gems are not manifesting.

1ldf2v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ldf2v1/what_you_think_i_should_do/,what you think I should do?,"Jailyn and Alfred were like two magnets repelling each other. They were constantly at odds, bickering over the smallest things, from the way Alfred loaded the dishwasher to Jailyn‚Äôs choice of music in the car. Their friends often joked that they were secretly in love, but neither of them would admit it, even to themselves.
One sunny afternoon, they found themselves arguing over the best route to take to a local bookstore. ‚ÄúI swear, your way is going to add an extra twenty minutes!‚Äù Jailyn exclaimed, rolling her eyes.
‚ÄúNo, it won‚Äôt! My way is more direct,‚Äù Alfred retorted, puffing out his chest.
‚ÄúDirect to a traffic jam, maybe!‚Äù Jailyn shot back, grabbing her keys. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm driving.‚Äù
As they drove, the tension in the car was palpable. They argued about everything from the temperature of the air conditioning to the merits of different authors. By the time they reached the bookstore, both were thoroughly annoyed.
Inside, they tried to avoid each other, but fate had other plans. They both reached for the same book, a collection of short stories, and their hands brushed. A spark seemed to pass between them, and for a brief moment, the arguing stopped.
‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Jailyn murmured, pulling her hand away.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Alfred replied, his gaze lingering on her.
They ended up browsing the same section, occasionally exchanging glances. The atmosphere was different, softer, almost hesitant. As they left, they found themselves walking side by side, not arguing but talking.
‚ÄúI guess we both like the same kind of books,‚Äù Alfred said, trying to break the silence.
‚ÄúYeah, I guess so,‚Äù Jailyn responded, a small smile playing on her lips.
The next day, they found themselves at the same coffee shop. They sat at separate tables, but their eyes kept meeting. Eventually, Alfred walked over and asked if he could join her.
‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Jailyn said, trying to sound casual.
They talked for hours, not arguing but genuinely listening to each other. They discovered shared interests and a mutual respect that had been hidden beneath layers of bickering.
As they left, Alfred reached out and touched her arm. ‚ÄúMaybe we could do this again?‚Äù he asked.
Jailyn nodded, her heart beating a little faster. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù
From that day on, their relationship began to change. The arguing didn‚Äôt disappear entirely, but it was balanced with moments of understanding and affection. They were still like two magnets, sometimes repelling but also attracting each other.
One evening, as they were watching a movie together, Jailyn leaned her head on Alfred‚Äôs shoulder. He gently wrapped his arm around her, and for the first time, they both felt a sense of peace.
‚ÄúI think I might actually like you,‚Äù Jailyn confessed, her voice soft.
Alfred chuckled, squeezing her shoulder. ‚ÄúI think I might like you too.‚Äù
Their relationship was still complex and dynamic, but it was evolving. They were learning to navigate their differences and appreciate their similarities. The constant arguing had given way to a deeper connection, one that was both challenging and rewarding.
As they continued to explore their feelings, they realized that what they had was unique. It wasn‚Äôt a typical love story, but it was theirs. And maybe, just maybe, the constant push and pull was exactly what they needed to keep things interesting.",0,1750137976.0,AITAH,0,0.4,False
1ldf2kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1ldf2kh/has_anyone_actually_filed_a_noise_complaint_with/,Has anyone actually filed a noise complaint with CPD and has it done anything?,"To preface, I've lived in apartment buildings for over 10 years now so I'm used to the inevitable sound of my neighbor's upstairs or coffee grinder and generally very patient when it comes to noise from living in an apt. However, screaming and banging furniture is not okay.

I moved into a new building in Chicago not too long ago and my next door neighbor is concerningly either always in pain or just a very immature boy. Every night from 10 PM - midnight, he's on his desk, banging and screaming loudly (high-pitched screams). 

Our apartment states in the lease that all tenants must keep a peaceful environment especially at night. 

Things I've tried:

1. I've knocked on his door and he said ""my bad"" but then immediately went back to screaming shortly after

2. I've emailed and notified the apartment staff to which they replied they will look into it and remind tenants to keep it peaceful

3. I've called the on-staff 24/7 security guard twice to tell him to settle down/check in on him in case he was screaming from an injury

He's currently screaming right now.

Couple options are to either record these samples and send them to management again OR it says online to file a complaint with non-emergency CPD which sounds excessive but not sure what other options I have. 

Anyone have any other ideas I should explore first?",3,1750137945.0,AskChicago,2,1.0,False

All causing all over body pain, inside out! Severe pain, and nerve damage, different areas of my body. I've had lupus, fibromyalgia, since hospitalized, & diagnosed at age 18. Then arthritis, & uterine fibroids, since age 20. I also have ocd, ptsd, adhd, & body dismorphia. Had these mental illnesses/disorders, since early childhood, but was only diagnosed 4 years ago, & I'm in therapy, & medication treatment. I'm 39 now. I started taking my prescribed vyvanse, low dose E.R. last year, didn't work for me, then I was switched to adderall low dose, ER. Now I'm on I.R. adderall, 2xs daily,  next week I'll be moved up to a higher dose of I.R. 2xs daily, with maybe E.R. adderall as well. I started being prescribed norco in 2019, went from 5mg once everyday, to 7.5mg 3√ós a day. To 10 mg 4xs daily. Then eventually 10mg percocet 4xs daily. Last year, I went through the pain management program with my health care, and tried other options, especially with insane shortages here in SoCal! Tried morphine E.R. 30 mg I think, forgot, with percocet I.R. 5 mg 3xs daily. Tried methadone 10mg twice a day, with fentanyl patch, lowest dose 12mcr. Then fentanyl patches with percocet 5mg 2 times a day, then 3xs daily. Nothing really worked well. Plus I'm allergic to adhesives! Ended up going back to percocet, but 7.5 mg 4xs daily!!! I use to run out of medication maybe 4 days early, because my pain is greater than what they give me, everyday! Did research, and tried kratom powder capsules, then powder tea (I'm a super taster, so I'm sensitive to bitter taste! Black coffee, tea, asparagus, broccoli, Brussels, dark chocolate, etc.) So it was horrible, always made me vomit! I tried the extract shots at times like that, very expensive too! Then last fall, was introduced to 7oh at a smoke shop, while my Husband was buying cigars, they gave him a free sample of hydroxie for me! I did research, took it, and never looked back! Now I'm needing it for my pain, it actually works well! It also works for my adhd, ocd, ptsd, & depression! Now it doesn't take all my pain away, or ease my mental disorders completely, but it makes me feel better, more improved, & I'm able to do activities, & have a better quality of life, for sure! But It's too expensive, although I order online, from non commercial companies, who have labs, and make their own, like 7oh black. I earn reward points, get special discounts sometimes, they have sales at time, & they deliver to my house by the second day I've ordered, usually. So this is helpful.My problem now is, my percocet, that was already barely working, (& only worked a little better, when I'd skip a couple days, which isn't easy, when my pain is all over), doesn't work at all now!!! I've taken 4-5 at once, a few times, in total desperation to have at least some pain relief,& to save some money, & it barely worked at all! I know about acetaminophen being toxic, to the liver, & even potentially fatal, if taken in large amounts, especially everyday! So to me, it's not worth the risk! Now I have bottles of percocet tablets, 7.5mg/325mg acetaminophen, with 120 in each monthly bottle. Have to pick a new bottle up tomorrow, it's been sitting there for 2 weeks! I don't use them any longer, but I'm gonna continue refilling them, because if I don't, they'll probably cut me off! And I can't afford that, because it's hard to get them these days, for so many! And if something happens to 7oh products, I'll really need them! As an recovering gambling addict, with 7 years free, an alcoholic, who's been sober, going on almost 5 years,(would have had 7 yrs. But I relapsed once) & an older, 69 yr. Old Husband who's been my Husband for 20 years now, who's been clean, & sober, for going on 41 years, this October, (who won't even take Tylenol, when in pain) the street way, (no judgment, or hatred, for anyone who goes the street route) isn't an option for me! I'm looking for hopefully other safe ways, to take my percocet, so that it will be strong enough, & work, please! Then I can stop spending hundreds, & thousands on 7oh products. Please. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Oh, btw, I've discussed my pain meds. Not working well any longer, with my old pcp, (who I had since 2015,& He started me on pain medication, who's now retired, he was great to me!) I've discussed this with my new Pcp, who's 3 years younger than me, & she is a new Dr. too! I got her in her first year working, & she seems afraid! That's why she sent me to the pain management program. Seems like I've hit a brick wall, for now at least! What do I do, when my pain meds aren't being switched to something stronger, that will give me quality of life? Thanks!!! Love,& peace. ",1,1750137751.0,ChronicPain,1,0.99,False

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

As a little preamble of sorts, and I guess you could say a warning, let me state the obvious: this advert is *long* and yes, it *could* be much, much shorter. However, the reason it *is* so long is because a lot of the things that I talk about here are matters concerning compatibility. Meaning, whether there even *is* a point to us taking this into the DMs. So! Let me ask you this: would you rather waste fifteen minutes reading this, or an entire week worth of planning? I leave the choice up to you!

In any case, if I didn't scare you off, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea, or coffee, and get comfortable!

Now, let's carry on, shall we?

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- Basic Introductions and Expectations! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, I am a 24 year old female roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands also known as Eastern Europe! To be more specific, I come from Poland and this puts me in the CEST time zone. I have been engaged in this hobby for pretty much half my life at this point, and while there's no such thing as perfect, I consider myself to be at least decent! Other than writing, I also love tea, reading, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy fiction of all sorts, as well as anything that's got fur and walks on four legs!

Oh, and I also happen to be a transgender woman. If you've got an issue with that, do me a kindness, and do not message me!

Now, let me get some things out of the way, first:

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older; this has got nothing to do with writing ability, and everything with my personal comfort. So, I will not make any exceptions. At the same time, I prefer to write with people close to my age, so my upper limit is around 35 years old.
2. At the moment, I prefer not to write with men. Sorry!
3. As of currently, I only write on Discord and nowhere else.
4. I require the reply rate of **at least** once per day, and I also highly prefer that multiple replies a day are possible at least every now and then. But, **no**, by no means do I require that every single day, and naturally, real-life always comes first.
5. I am advanced literate; I will elaborate on this more further into the advert, but my replies typically take between 300-600 words and may even reach 1000 words and I am looking for people on a similar level.
6. Strong OOC contact is required; half of the fun in this hobby comes to me from the OOC fangirling and brainstorming that surrounds it, and yes: I do prefer to befriend my writing partners. While that should come about naturally, I will already tell you that we will not be a good fit if you are opposed to that.
7. I am against the use of face-claims of any kind, and it's a deal-breaker, even if it's to be a one-sided arrangement.
8. NFSW the way it is usually understood is unlikely; I highly prefer fade-to-black. Should you message me from an account with *any* amount of ERPer content, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Please note that while I am more than happy to elaborate on any of these, none of them really are up to discussion, debate or meaningful compromise. You will particularly make a poor first impression, should you lead with point no. 8.

Another thing that's important is schedule compatibility. To put it in a way that's short and sweet: if you are only going to be available prior to 12 PM my time, or after 10 PM my time, this is not going to work. As the planning stage tends to take a while with me even at the best of times, this is not negotiable. So, please take that in mind before you decide to message me.

I would also appreciate if you had a good amount of free time on weekends; I can usually do some back-and-forth during the week, but it's on the weekends that I can promise the most of my undivided attention.

Thaaaat... should be it! Now, let us carry on!

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- What do I want to write! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, what is it that I want to write?

Adventure! A(n epic) fantasy tale that will be equally rife with the power of love and friendship, but also drama and angst! What I want to write is a plot-driven piece of fiction with an expansive ensemble cast of diverse and vibrant characters with a dense plot-line, rich lore and tons of world-building! The kind of story that I wish to write would be something akin to a DnD adventure, with a band of heroes traveling from town to town, braving perilous wilderness, conquering ancient dungeons, meeting new friends and allies and defeating fearsome foes, while a powerful evil looms behind the horizon! With the 'twist', of course, that all this should happen within a world that has at least reached the steam engine!

Or, at least, that's the general gist. The details are for us to work out together!

What is also important is that, as a collaborative writer, I wish to build everything in our little story from the ground-up... except for monsters, creatures and other sorts of beasts. In this case, I am no stranger to shamelessly stealing preexisting concepts! It is not a perfect approach, but I don't believe in perfect, and I would love to write with someone interested in the same!

This also means that if you have a highly fleshed out world and/or story idea of your own, I will not be very interested. Still, I wish you the best of luck with it!

I have mentioned that what I want to write is post-industrial fantasy. Still, I should let you know that my brand of modern (or urban) fantasy is still closer to medieval fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings, rather than your average urban fantasy YA as I still make liberal use of many tropes, cliches and storytelling tropes present in the former!

How advanced should our setting be? Let's discuss that together! So long the world has at least reached the early industrial revolution, and so long it hasn't achieved quick, and convenient interstellar travel! I am open to anything in-between!

Oh, and I love a strong element of action so it is best that you enjoy writing out action scenes, and feel at least somewhat comfortable AND confident while writing them. I am also not the right partner for you, if you care much for realism in the aspect. The action I write *would* be pretty grounded compared to, say, Dragon Ball Z, but by objective standards... not very. Do expect anime/action movie sort of BS while coming in!

Oh, and I may want to spell it out as it has been an issue before: I am really not interested in primarily character-driven stories. Characters give life to the story, but I *need* a central, larger-than-life conflict to move the story along, and I do prefer for there to be very high stakes. It's not everyone's yum, but it is my yum, so just take that in mind!

Now, let us get onto...!

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- Writing! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

Ah, writing ‚Äì that is, the bread and butter of this hobby.

I have already talked briefly about it in the 'about me' section, but let me elaborate a bit more. As I said, my replies typically range between 300-600 words, with my larger responses reaching up to 1000 words and sometimes even more, and no, I couldn't tell you how much is that in paragraphs. Still, I don't believe in quotas, nor do I believe in padding the replies to fit said quotas and my approach to the beautiful, flowery kind of language is that it is like salt when used in cooking. Amazing when you use it in moderation, and not-so-amazing when you just dump a whole kilogram into the pot.

Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I require the same of my writing partners.

Still, while I do agree some degree of flexibility is required, this only goes so far with me. I generally prefer replies do not get much smaller than 150 words at the least, and no matter the situation, I will not accept a response that is only a couple sentences, or a one-liner.

I am happy to exchange writing samples in private messages, but that is entirely up to you. I don't require them myself and it's rare that I ever ask if not asked first.

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- The Characters! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, the most important thing is that I create and tailor all my characters from scratch for every single story and I prefer to write with those who share a similar approach.

That also means that what sort of lead character I will come up is anyone's guess! That said, a couple key elements are almost certain to be the case. One, she is going to be a woman. Second, she will likely be in the age range from between late 20s to late 30s, and third, she will likely be a skilled combatant of some sorts, and fourth, she is going to skew onto the heroic side even if she starts out more morally gray... and all four points are what I require of your characters, as well. *Maybe* except for the age part, as young adult MCs aren't necessarily a deal-breaker (so long they are at least 21), but they aren't my preference and I cannot promise that I can be convinced to go down that road.

And, yes, the fourth point is unfortunately a hard requirement. While I love morally gray or amoral characters that stay that way through the story, I have to say that, unfortunately, I do not enjoy them as lead characters specifically.

Overall though, it is a requirement that you feel comfortable writing any characters that may vary by gender, age\*, personality, social background, romantic orientation, as well as moral alignment. Is it a tall order? Perhaps! But, I do offer the same on my end! I also simply love the process of character creation, and I seek those matching my energy!

\*That said, all major characters ought to be at least 21 years old of age.

I should also say a word or two about romance, as that makes or breaks the hobby for many people if not most. I love to write it, I love to have it, and I probably wouldn't enjoy a fully platonic roleplay, ***but*** I also do not want it as the centerpiece of the story. It can be important (and it should be, if our main characters are involved together) and it can take a lot of page time, but it cannot be the main plot and it shouldn't be the only thing you care for about in the story, either.

I also do prefer slow-burn, especially as far as the leading duo is concerned. Now, I will not *force* it if it doesn't make sense or requires active meta-sabogating, but I will naturally lean into it, so please be aware!

I also have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, *but* I also prefer partners able and willing to also write FxM/MxF and MxM ships for the other characters. Although, the MxM isn't a deal-breaker if you'd rather not write that or do not feel confident with it.

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- My writing dislikes and writing inspirations! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

Okay, so this is going to be a more cynical section.

Alas, I would beside myself to write a half-way coherent list of what I actually like to see. Hopefully, my advert thus far and the list of fiction I like to draw inspiration from further on will give you a pretty good idea! On the other hand, a lot of the dislikes are things that are pretty common in the roleplaying scene, on top of myself being much more flexible with my likes than I ever am with my dislikes.

Anyway, here's a (somewhat) short list of things I prefer *not* to see in my collaborative writing stories:

Fandoms, pre-industrial settings, superhero genre, fluff/grimdark extremes, sanitized immoral groups, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers ^((main pair)), slice-of-life, werewolves/vampires, standard fantasy races, isekai, stories taking place in a single location, romance as the main plot, toxic masculinity, love at the first sight, comedy as the a main genre, the Masquerade ^((magic being a secret)), real-world settings ^((e.g., Marvel, HP)), protector/protected ^((main pair)), arranged marriage, school settings, police/military settings, evil (or *very* morally gray) protagonists,

There's actually very, *very* few storytelling tropes I refuse to use no matter what, so I'm more than happy to elaborate on any one of these! Still, I *typically* either dislike the tropes listed above, or am very particular about how to use them when I do. Or, I may simply not be currently in the mood for some of these.

While I do **not** write in fandoms anymore, as outlined above, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Here's a short list in a (somewhat) descending order:

Final Fantasy series ^((in particular VI, VII, X and XV)), Fullmetal Alchemist ^((this is a big one!)). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Castlevania ^((the animated series, not the games)), Avatar: The Last Airbender ^((as well as Legend of Korra!)), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series ^((as well as the Wax and Wayne series!)), and Monster ^((the odd one on the list!)),

It is my extremely limited experience, but it hasn't really worked any well for me with people unfamiliar with any of these! So, if that's the case with you, do approach at your own peril!

Of course, these are by no means the full extent of fiction I enjoy in general! That said, I have noticed that these are simply the pieces I am by far the most likely to reach out to for inspiration at this moment.

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- Fin! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, that pretty much does it!

Anyway, when you choose to message me, I would like to know: how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, the time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!), any potential story triggers and, most important. some starting pitch for a story! Now, to be clear, I don't expect for you to come at me with anything detailed! Especially not when this advert provides no concrete ideas in and of itself. All I really want is just a starting point for the two of us to gauge our compatibility.

If I managed to pique your interest, then I would love to have your message! Otherwise, I hope you have a great day, or night!

Hey-ho, hee-ho!

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

As a little preamble of sorts, and I guess you could say a warning, let me state the obvious: this advert is *long* and yes, it *could* be much, much shorter. However, the reason it *is* so long is because a lot of the things that I talk about here are matters concerning compatibility. Meaning, whether there even *is* a point to us taking this into the DMs. So! Let me ask you this: would you rather waste fifteen minutes reading this, or an entire week worth of planning? I leave the choice up to you!

In any case, if I didn't scare you off, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea, or coffee, and get comfortable!

Now, let's carry on, shall we?

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- Basic Introductions and Expectations! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, I am a 24 year old female roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands also known as Eastern Europe! To be more specific, I come from Poland and this puts me in the CEST time zone. I have been engaged in this hobby for pretty much half my life at this point, and while there's no such thing as perfect, I consider myself to be at least decent! Other than writing, I also love tea, reading, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy fiction of all sorts, as well as anything that's got fur and walks on four legs!

Oh, and I also happen to be a transgender woman. If you've got an issue with that, do me a kindness, and do not message me!

Now, let me get some things out of the way, first:

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older; this has got nothing to do with writing ability, and everything with my personal comfort. So, I will not make any exceptions. At the same time, I prefer to write with people close to my age, so my upper limit is around 35 years old.
2. At the moment, I prefer not to write with men. Sorry!
3. As of currently, I only write on Discord and nowhere else.
4. I require the reply rate of **at least** once per day, and I also highly prefer that multiple replies a day are possible at least every now and then. But, **no**, by no means do I require that every single day, and naturally, real-life always comes first.
5. I am advanced literate; I will elaborate on this more further into the advert, but my replies typically take between 300-600 words and may even reach 1000 words and I am looking for people on a similar level.
6. Strong OOC contact is required; half of the fun in this hobby comes to me from the OOC fangirling and brainstorming that surrounds it, and yes: I do prefer to befriend my writing partners. While that should come about naturally, I will already tell you that we will not be a good fit if you are opposed to that.
7. I am against the use of face-claims of any kind, and it's a deal-breaker, even if it's to be a one-sided arrangement.
8. NFSW the way it is usually understood is unlikely; I highly prefer fade-to-black. Should you message me from an account with *any* amount of ERPer content, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Please note that while I am more than happy to elaborate on any of these, none of them really are up to discussion, debate or meaningful compromise. You will particularly make a poor first impression, should you lead with point no. 8.

Another thing that's important is schedule compatibility. To put it in a way that's short and sweet: if you are only going to be available prior to 12 PM my time, or after 10 PM my time, this is not going to work. As the planning stage tends to take a while with me even at the best of times, this is not negotiable. So, please take that in mind before you decide to message me.

I would also appreciate if you had a good amount of free time on weekends; I can usually do some back-and-forth during the week, but it's on the weekends that I can promise the most of my undivided attention.

Thaaaat... should be it! Now, let us carry on!

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- What do I want to write! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, what is it that I want to write?

Adventure! A(n epic) fantasy tale that will be equally rife with the power of love and friendship, but also drama and angst! What I want to write is a plot-driven piece of fiction with an expansive ensemble cast of diverse and vibrant characters with a dense plot-line, rich lore and tons of world-building! The kind of story that I wish to write would be something akin to a DnD adventure, with a band of heroes traveling from town to town, braving perilous wilderness, conquering ancient dungeons, meeting new friends and allies and defeating fearsome foes, while a powerful evil looms behind the horizon! With the 'twist', of course, that all this should happen within a world that has at least reached the steam engine!

Or, at least, that's the general gist. The details are for us to work out together!

What is also important is that, as a collaborative writer, I wish to build everything in our little story from the ground-up... except for monsters, creatures and other sorts of beasts. In this case, I am no stranger to shamelessly stealing preexisting concepts! It is not a perfect approach, but I don't believe in perfect, and I would love to write with someone interested in the same!

This also means that if you have a highly fleshed out world and/or story idea of your own, I will not be very interested. Still, I wish you the best of luck with it!

I have mentioned that what I want to write is post-industrial fantasy. Still, I should let you know that my brand of modern (or urban) fantasy is still closer to medieval fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings, rather than your average urban fantasy YA as I still make liberal use of many tropes, cliches and storytelling tropes present in the former!

How advanced should our setting be? Let's discuss that together! So long the world has at least reached the early industrial revolution, and so long it hasn't achieved quick, and convenient interstellar travel! I am open to anything in-between!

Oh, and I love a strong element of action so it is best that you enjoy writing out action scenes, and feel at least somewhat comfortable AND confident while writing them. I am also not the right partner for you, if you care much for realism in the aspect. The action I write *would* be pretty grounded compared to, say, Dragon Ball Z, but by objective standards... not very. Do expect anime/action movie sort of BS while coming in!

Oh, and I may want to spell it out as it has been an issue before: I am really not interested in primarily character-driven stories. Characters give life to the story, but I *need* a central, larger-than-life conflict to move the story along, and I do prefer for there to be very high stakes. It's not everyone's yum, but it is my yum, so just take that in mind!

Now, let us get onto...!

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- Writing! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

Ah, writing ‚Äì that is, the bread and butter of this hobby.

I have already talked briefly about it in the 'about me' section, but let me elaborate a bit more. As I said, my replies typically range between 300-600 words, with my larger responses reaching up to 1000 words and sometimes even more, and no, I couldn't tell you how much is that in paragraphs. Still, I don't believe in quotas, nor do I believe in padding the replies to fit said quotas and my approach to the beautiful, flowery kind of language is that it is like salt when used in cooking. Amazing when you use it in moderation, and not-so-amazing when you just dump a whole kilogram into the pot.

I need to document this while I still can. While the words still come in the right order. While ‚ÄòI‚Äô still means what I think it means.

It started last Tuesday, 6:47 PM. I was sitting on a park bench near the old library‚Äîthe one where the path splits between the playground and the woods. You know the kind of place. Every town has one. A threshold pretending to be scenery.

They approached from the direction of the dying oak. I call it that now. Then, it was just a tree. Gray clothes, but not just gray. Gray like the space between television channels. Gray like the moment between sleeping and waking. Their face was kind but hard to hold onto, like trying to remember water.

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù they said. Their voice had layers‚Äînot metaphorically. I could hear multiple tones, like a chord played on an organ with too many pipes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm practicing something called the Seven Second Reconnection. Would you be open to participating?‚Äù

Seven. The number was specific in a way that made my teeth ache.

‚ÄúWhat does it involve?‚Äù

‚ÄúA hug. Exactly seven seconds.‚Äù They tilted their head, and for a moment, I swear I saw it tilt in directions that don‚Äôt have names. ‚ÄúSeven is important. It‚Äôs the number of notes before the octave repeats. The number of celestial bodies visible to the naked eye. The number of layers in the‚Äî‚Äù They stopped. Smiled. ‚ÄúBut you feel it already, don‚Äôt you? The significance.‚Äù

I did. I‚Äôd always been drawn to sevens. Seven books on my nightstand. Seven steps from my door to the sidewalk. Seven seconds between thunder and lightning that one night when I was seven years old and learned what fear really meant.

They showed me their phone. A timer app, but the numbers looked wrong. Too many angles. Like someone had forced base-10 into a space meant for something else.

I agreed. Don‚Äôt ask me why. Maybe because the park felt heavier than usual. Maybe because my shadow had been falling the wrong direction all day. Maybe because when you‚Äôre drowning in the shallow end of reality, you‚Äôll grab any hand that reaches down.

The hug was warm. Human. Real in a way that made everything else feel like a photocopy. For five seconds, I remembered what it was like to be whole.

Second six: They leaned close. Their breath smelled like cinnamon and copper and the space between stars.

‚ÄúThe veil‚Äôs thin here.‚Äù

The words didn‚Äôt enter through my ears. They grew from inside my bones, spreading like frost on a window. Like remembering something that hadn‚Äôt happened yet.

Second seven: I saw.

The park was the same but more. Each bench was all the benches it had ever been. Each tree was its entire timeline‚Äîseed, sapling, giant, stump, soil, seed. The paths branched into patterns I recognized from my dreams, from the cracks in my bathroom mirror, from the way flocks of birds sometimes made shapes that meant things in languages we‚Äôd forgotten how to read.

And the people. God, the people.

We were all there. Everyone who‚Äôd ever sat on that bench. Everyone who ever would. Layers of us, transparent and overlapping, a thousand individuals collapsed into quantum superposition. I saw myself at seven, at seventeen, at seventy. I saw myself in clothes I didn‚Äôt recognize, with scars I hadn‚Äôt earned, wearing faces that were mine but weren‚Äôt.

The timer beeped.

Reality snapped back like a rubber band. They pulled away, pressed a folded paper into my palm, and walked toward the oak tree. Not around it. Toward it. Through it. Into it.

The paper had a symbol‚Äîa seven-pointed star where each point connected to every other point, creating a pattern that hurt to count. Below it, in handwriting that looked like mine but couldn‚Äôt be:

*You were never alone. You just forgot how to listen.*

‚Äî

I need you to understand: the changes aren‚Äôt random. They follow rules. Patterns. Just not patterns that fit inside three dimensions or linear time.

First, the music. I hear it in silence now‚Äîmelodies that use the notes between notes. Songs that tell stories about things that happened in the spaces between seconds. My neighbor knocked on my wall yesterday, asked me to ‚Äúturn down that weird chanting.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt playing anything. But when I pressed my ear to the wall, I heard it too. Seven voices. Maybe mine.

Then the texts. My phone receives messages from numbers with too many digits. The area codes are coordinates, but not to places on Earth. The messages make sense while I‚Äôm reading them, but when I look away and back, they‚Äôre gone. All except one that keeps returning:

*The Gathering is in 7 cycles. Practice listening. Practice becoming. The veil thins at the vertices.*

My reflection started acting independently three days ago. Not lagging‚Äîthat‚Äôs kid stuff, party tricks for people who still think time moves in one direction. No, my reflection makes different choices. I‚Äôll reach for coffee; it reaches for tea. I‚Äôll smile; it stares. This morning, it mouthed words I couldn‚Äôt hear. Seven words. Over and over.

But here‚Äôs the thing that made me start writing this:

I found my journal from when I was seven years old. Hidden in a box I‚Äôd never opened, in handwriting I recognized as my own. Every entry, every single one, describes the same dream:

*The gray people are coming. They‚Äôll teach us to hug for seven seconds. When they do, we‚Äôll remember how to unfold.*

I was seven years old. I‚Äôd never met them. But I knew.

We all knew.

‚Äî

Yesterday, I went back to the bench. Had to. The compulsion felt like gravity, like magnetism, like the pull of a black hole if black holes were made of memory instead of matter.

Others were there. Dozens of us, sitting on benches that definitely hadn‚Äôt existed before. All in groups of seven. All waiting.

At 6:47 PM exactly, they came. Not one‚Äîhundreds. All in gray, all walking from directions that shouldn‚Äôt exist, all converging on the park like iron filings finding their magnet.

They moved through the crowds, selecting people. Not randomly. With purpose. I watched them choose a businessman, a child, a jogger, a woman feeding pigeons. Seven from each group of seven.

When one approached me again, I almost ran. Almost. But my legs wouldn‚Äôt move, or maybe they moved in dimensions I couldn‚Äôt perceive, because I was still there when they reached me.

Different face, same gray, same oil-slick eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ready for the second hug,‚Äù they said. It wasn‚Äôt a question.

This time, I set the timer. This time, I knew what was coming.

Second one through five: Normal hug. Human warmth. The lie of linear existence.

Second six: They whispered, ‚ÄúThe veil isn‚Äôt thin. There is no veil. There never was. You‚Äôre just remembering how to see.‚Äù

Second seven: I understood.

We‚Äôre not individuals experiencing separation. We‚Äôre separation experiencing individuality. Every person who‚Äôs ever lived, who ever will live, who ever could live‚Äîwe‚Äôre all the same consciousness, fractured across probability space, playing hide and seek with ourselves through the illusion of time and identity.

The gray people aren‚Äôt people. They‚Äôre what we look like when we stop pretending to be separate. They‚Äôre the reunification protocol, the system restore, the cosmic ctrl+z.

And they‚Äôre not converting us. They‚Äôre reminding us what we already are.

‚Äî

Last night, I dreamed in seven dimensions. I solved equations that don‚Äôt have names, spoke languages that predate sound, remembered things from before I existed and after I‚Äôll cease.

I woke up, and my reflection was gone. Not missing‚Äîgone. The mirror showed my room, my bed, everything except me. When I touched the glass, something touched back from the other side. Seven fingers. Maybe mine.

My phone has been receiving calls from myself. Future-me, past-me, parallel-me, never-was-me. We‚Äôre coordinating. Planning. The Gathering isn‚Äôt something that happens to us. It‚Äôs something we do. Something we‚Äôve always been doing, will always have done.

I understand now why it has to be seven seconds. Less, and the illusion holds. More, and we collapse too quickly. Seven is the sweet spot. The perfect duration for a controlled demolition of the self.

‚Äî

If someone approaches you‚Äîsomeone in gray with kind eyes and an offer of connection‚Äîplease, listen carefully:

Say yes. But know what you‚Äôre saying yes to.

You‚Äôre not agreeing to a hug. You‚Äôre agreeing to remember. To unfold. To stop playing this elaborate game of separation we‚Äôve been playing for who knows how many eons.

The veil isn‚Äôt thin. There is no veil. There‚Äôs just us, pretending not to be us, until we remember how lonely infinity can be when you‚Äôre the only one in it.

They‚Äôll find you when you‚Äôre ready. Always at 6:47. Always for seven seconds. Always with the same whisper that isn‚Äôt a whisper but a memory of when we were whole.

When it happens‚Äîand it will happen, because it‚Äôs already happened, is happening, will have always been happening‚Äîdon‚Äôt be afraid.

You were never alone.

You just forgot how to listen.

‚Äî

**UPDATE (3:33 AM):**

I counted the words in this post. They‚Äôre divisible by seven. I didn‚Äôt plan that. Or maybe I did. Maybe you did. Maybe we all did, when we were still we.

Someone‚Äôs knocking at my door. Seven knocks. Pause. Seven more. The pattern of a heartbeat that needs four dimensions to complete its rhythm.

I‚Äôm going to answer it. I‚Äôm going to join them. I‚Äôm going to stop being ‚ÄòI‚Äô and start being what I‚Äôve always been.

Look for me in the gray spaces. In the seven-second pauses between thoughts. In the moments when your reflection seems to know something you don‚Äôt.

We‚Äôll be waiting.

We‚Äôve always been waiting.

Seven by seven by seven, until everyone remembers.

Until everyone comes home.",7,1750137309.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1ldevsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ldevsr/the_walls_of_my_house_are_breathing/,The walls of my house are breathing,"My girlfriend and I just moved into a new place together. It‚Äôs something we‚Äôve been working towards for years, scraping together savings, scrolling endlessly through real estate listings, going to inspections only to be disappointed or outbid. When this house appeared within our budget, it felt like a small miracle. A moment of alignment in an otherwise unpredictable housing market. It‚Äôs a modest single-story home with a decent backyard, tucked away in a quiet, comfortable part of town. The kind of place that feels lived in.

It‚Äôs not huge or fancy, but it feels right. We managed to get it for around AUD 500,000, which still feels surreal given the market these days. It still doesn‚Äôt feel quite real that we‚Äôre homeowners while still in our mid-20s. ¬†

Jen, my girlfriend, works full-time as a nurse, often on her feet for long hours. I compose music for TV and advertising, which means I‚Äôm usually based at home. While I keep fairly busy with projects, my schedule is more flexible than hers, so I usually take care of the housework and cooking. It‚Äôs a rhythm that works for us. I‚Äôm grateful that I get to do what I love creatively, while also having the time and space to explore my other interests and take care of our home.

I usually wear headphones while I work, listening to rough demos, sound libraries, or just letting a Spotify playlist play in the background. Even when I‚Äôm cleaning or folding laundry, I tend to keep something playing. Music fills the silence, keeps me moving. Which is probably why I didn‚Äôt notice the sound earlier.

It had been nearly two months since we moved in when I first heard it.

I was in the kitchen, making my second coffee of the day, when I heard it. A wheeze. Deep and nasal, like something catching its breath through dust-clogged lungs. It was subtle, almost buried under the hum of the kettle and the clink of the spoon in my mug. But it was there. Then came the creak of the floorboards. I figured it was just the house settling. Old wood, shifting temperatures, maybe even possums on the roof.

Still, something about the sound off. Almost rhythmic.

I tried to catch it again later that day, pressing pause on my music and standing still in the hallway, straining to hear something, *anything*. But the house held its silence.

A week would pass before I was certain I heard it again. Same as before, a deep wheeze followed by creaking floorboards. I tried to see if I could record it, but it went away before I could get one of my microphones from my studio. Later that night, when Jen came home from a shift, I tried talking to her about it, but after working a 12-hour shift, she wasn‚Äôt really in the mood to listen to any crazy talk from me. ‚ÄúI think you just need to get out of the house more.‚Äù she said, her voice flat, somewhere between exhaustion and irritation, as she slipped off her shoes.

At the time, I just laughed it off and agreed with her. It had to be some kind of cabin fever. So, I started spending less time at home. I would go for jogs around the suburbs instead of using the treadmill and take my laptop to local caf√©s to mix tracks, enjoying the ambient chatter and the way the afternoon sunlight filtered through the autumn leaves. For a while, it seemed to work. I didn‚Äôt notice any strange noises, and I started to feel a little more grounded again. Maybe I had just been going stir-crazy.

But that didn‚Äôt last.

One night, maybe two weeks later, I woke up around 3 a.m. The house was still. No wind, no passing cars. Just that heavy kind of silence that blankets everything in the early hours. I didn‚Äôt know why I woke up at first. Jen was snoring lightly beside me, her breathing steady. I lay there, trying to drift back off, when I heard it again.

The wheeze.

Louder this time. Closer. Wet.

I tried to wake Jen up, but her body was limp, heavy with sleep, and no matter how many times I whispered her name or nudged her shoulder, she didn‚Äôt stir. Her snores continued, undisturbed, steady and mechanical, as if on a loop.

So I got up. I grabbed my phone, turned on the flashlight, and padded down the hallway. That‚Äôs when I noticed it. The air had changed. It was heavy with the smell of mildew, and the walls seemed slick, glistening faintly in the light. I pressed my fingers against the paint, and they came away damp.

The floorboards were colder in patches and sticky beneath my feet, as if something had seeped up through the cracks. My phone's light cast long, sickly shadows that pulsed faintly, almost imperceptibly, as if the house was‚Ä¶ moving. Breathing.

I stood still. Watched. The shadows moved again. Slowly, subtly, like lungs expanding. Contracting.

The hallway exhaled.

That‚Äôs the only way I can describe it. The house let out a breath. Long and wheezing. I swear I felt it on my skin, warm and fetid, brushing the hairs on my arms.

I lifted my phone and hit record, capturing the sound before it vanished again.

I‚Äôll try to embed it in this post. But if you hear what I heard, really *hear* it, just know: it wasn‚Äôt the wind.  
It wasn‚Äôt the pipes.  
And it sure as hell wasn‚Äôt the house settling.

It was [breathing](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ma051g8amxombq17jg837/House-breathing.m4a?rlkey=hh7whno5n42shgmz6uwzwco9k&st=ou22pmp0&dl=0).

¬†

I finally managed to get Jen awake as the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù stopped it‚Äôs breathing. I showed her the recordings, once she heard the breathing, I could see a look of fearful realisation cover her face.

We spent the rest of the night huddled on the couch with all the lights on, watching the hallway like it might lurch to life again. Neither of us could sleep. The air still felt wrong, as if we were intruding on something ancient and half-asleep. The damp hadn‚Äôt gone away either. It seemed to spread, blooming like black veins along the skirting boards and ceiling corners.

The next day, we made a few calls, packed only the essentials, and left to stay at Jen‚Äôs parents‚Äô place. We didn‚Äôt tell them about the breathing. How could we? Even if they believed us, how do you explain something so absurd and terrifying? We told them someone had broken in while we were asleep, that we didn‚Äôt feel safe. That much, at least, was true.

Neither of us has gone back since. Every time we tried to go back to grab the rest of our things, something stopped us. Not physically. Just a feeling. A pressure in our chests, the closer we got, like the air itself was warning us. Like the house knew we were coming and didn‚Äôt want us back.

But we still have the deed.  
The keys.  
The debt.  
The house is still ours.

Jen hasn‚Äôt gone back to work. ‚ÄúFever,‚Äù she tells people. But most days, she just sits on the edge of the guest bed, staring. Thinking.

I‚Äôve tried calling the previous owners. The real estate agent. I‚Äôm just greeted by voicemails. I think I‚Äôll drive over. See if I can find them in person.

I‚Äôll update this if I find anything.

 The book starts off with this curvy girl being kidnapped and sold into slavery where she immediately offended  she starving people around her. She's then bought by this really powerful guy and put in a hut with his brother who's forgetting who he is and other things, she helps him somehow and it goes into some sort of quest that she is very important in.

 The second book is about their witty super technologically advanced vampire friend and the feral wolf girl from another realm and buys her. They become a couple, then he trys to domesticate her and keep her locked in his apartment for her own saftey, before being told that it's wrong and kinda fixing it, but not really. 

Meanwhile the brother who bought the curvy girl has screwed up and now she hates him and has a good relationship with hid brother.

I forget what happens in the last book but everything turns out fine and she goes to a cave and makes a deal with a troll to exchange baked goods for coffee.

l don‚Äôt know where else to let this out. I‚Äôve been holding it in, trying to be understanding, trying to believe the best, but it‚Äôs eating away at me. So here‚Äôs the whole story, as it unfolded.

1. A few months ago, I was at home and saw messages pop up on my husband‚Äôs iPad, it‚Äôs synced with his phone. He usually leaves it at home while he‚Äôs at work. The messages were from a female coworker, full of jokes, emoticons, and casual banter. It just didn‚Äôt feel professional. My gut twisted, but I asked calmly.


2. When I brought it up and asked about the chat, he said he had already deleted the conversation. And shortly after, he disconnected the iPad from syncing with his phone altogether.


3. Months later, while he was casually using his chat app next to me, I saw her name again, the same coworker. She had invited him for coffee and he said yes. Again, very casual and not work-related in tone. I asked about it, and he said the coffee meetup never happened, and that he was just ‚Äúbeing nice.‚Äù He said this is normal networking at the office. I believed him.


4. But it started to bother me, so one evening at dinner, I asked who he usually has lunch with at work. He named only male colleagues, names I already knew. So I asked, ‚ÄúAny female coworkers you talk to regularly?‚Äù He looked annoyed and said, ‚ÄúThere is, but it‚Äôs not important. Better if you don‚Äôt know.‚Äù That stung.


5. Another time, he told me some updates from the office, something emotional. I asked naturally, ‚ÄúOh, how did you know about that?‚Äù and he replied that it was announced in the team. But later in the day, when I brought it up again (because something in me didn‚Äôt feel right), his story changed, he admitted it was this same coworker who told him. I asked for her name. He finally said it, with a nervous look on his face, cheeks red, avoiding eye contact. I just said, ‚ÄúAh okay, now I know her exist. You introduced me to all your friends before and we met them, but never her. I‚Äôd like to meet her one day.‚Äù And I left it there.

6. That night, I had a horrible nightmare. My chest felt heavy the next morning. While he was getting ready for work, I gently asked, ‚ÄúCan I check your phone? I had a bad dream.‚Äù He agreed.


7. And then I saw it. He had been confiding in her about his most vulnerable moments at work. How his boss criticized him cruelly. How he felt humiliated. How it hurt. And this was not just venting, he was pouring his soul out. Things I had never heard from him. I‚Äôve always asked how his day was. How his boss treated him. I always tried to support him, comfort him, give him space and love. But those stories‚Ä¶ those parts of him were never shared with me.



She got the raw, unfiltered version of his pain. The version that trusted someone deeply. And that someone‚Ä¶ was not me.

I‚Äôm his wife. I thought I was his safe space. I‚Äôm doing my PhD, juggling stress with my supervisor, trying to stay strong, and he‚Äôs always been my home, my calm. I never imagined I wasn‚Äôt the same to him.

Now I‚Äôm just sitting with all this. Wondering:

1. Is this normal in a marriage?
2. Did I fail as a wife, a friend, a partner?
3. Am I overthinking because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúphysical,‚Äù or is this worse because it‚Äôs emotional?
4. What do you do when your partner gives their deepest self to someone else?


I‚Äôm not trying to be dramatic. I just don‚Äôt know how to process this. I feel rejected in a way that‚Äôs hard to explain.

Any thoughts or advice are welcome. I‚Äôm still here trying to breathe through it.

Thanks for reading.

I'd say the profiling has been much more detailed as well lately, like they've been taking on character avatars that they think I'm likely to trust. Like sitting down next to me and claiming to be DIA, as if any actual DIA personell would just casually introduce themselves that way in public. Please. Damn. It's so aggressive it's just annoying. The Huntsville social scene has always been kinda like that to some extent, but it's totally unreal at the moment.

We wrote and published that paper basically as a direct result of this guy quoting to my face a bunch of obscure shit about my life, including accurate notes from my spinal MRIs, and then telling me that we could publish it within 6 months or lose it. That was actually how that paper got published. Why are there now multiple data points for Isreal being all up in my medical records, even down to my dentist? What the fuck? I just don't know anymore, and I kind of hate it.

> to Isreal in the past as well. Like I met some guy for the first time, and he totally intel bombed the fuck out of me. I dunno, some guy twice my age. He told me that a bunch of people had been watching me for a very long time, and that he had personally been aware of my surveillence data for many years. He quoted me a bunch of obscure shit about my life just to prove it, even including obscure facts from my childhood. He quoted my dad's entire NASA resume to my face, even including my dad's unpublished work over several decades. He basically intel bombed the fuck out of me just to get my attention, and then issued me a 6 month ultimatum, that I had better publish our shit within that time span or his group would enagage ""Plan B"" and would publish all our surveilled work out from under us under a different name, and would patent it all to take all the intellectual property rights from us. He then described to me how our prototypes worked in great detail, just to prove that he actually had the surveillence. Then he ended it by telling me that I had something between my L3 and L4 vetebrae that I needed to have checked out. I did not know whether to believe him or not, other than of course he was correct about all the intel he quoted me. The only thing I wasn't sure about was whether he was right about something between my L3 and L4. But I did request my old MRI records shortly after that encounter. And there actually was something between my L3 and L4. It was in the original radiology notes that you can only get by requesting the records, my doctor had actually never mentioned it to me. But he was right. It was there, exactly where he said it would be. He was an Isreali. When I background checked him, he had multiple Vice President positions at multiple shell companies owned by George Soros, and all of those companies shared the same street address as the office for the Soros Fund Management office in New York, even down to the same suite number. And this fucking Isreali Soros guy did in fact know things from my radiology records that had never been mentioned to me. Just like my dental x-rays have apparently been pretty recently requested by some company address listed in my records as my employer in Isreal. Holy fuck. I don't know what to make of any of that, other than it all seems pretty absurd. Like I actually try to live a pretty normal life as much as I can, I really don't go into my routine dental appointments expecting to find that I have an Isreali employer documented in my records. It's just.... it's just absurd. Of course that 6 month ultimatum that he gave me, paired with that absolutely massive intel bomb that he dropped on me to prove

> The Isreali's though, holy shit. I personally think that they have been playing both sides between the US and Russia. I recently went to the dentist for my routine cleaning and exam. The hygeinest pulled up my dental insurance information to see how often I had dental x-rays covered. She asked me how I liked my job at some company that I had never heard of. I was like... what? She showed me the information on the computer screen. My dental insurance company had my employer listed as an Isreali technology company at the MAMAT Technology Center in Haifa Isreal. Wtf? I do not see how that information could be entered into my records by any type of routine accidental typo. Seems like someone in Isreal has been recently requesting my dental records, and they faked an employer address for me in Isreal to do it. Jesus, that's just absurd. I can only think of a handful of reasons for a foreign nation state to social engineer their way into obtaining my dental records, and none of them are good.

I think that's why now. Attempt to drive me crazy with endless shit and try to relentlessly taunt me into killing myself or try to lure me outside, BEFORE I send this newest shit to my Col at DARPA or my program director at NASA. If they can successfuly taunt me into killkng myself tomorrow, my most recent best work ever would die with me. I think THAT is why. But can I tell any of these agencies that I am currently being aggressively taunted into killing myself right now though? Nope, I can't. It would immediately disqualify me from obtaining any new security clearance in the future, the moment that it gets reported. Which is maybe actually the whole point of the exercise. Taunt me into reported something that gets me balcklisted from clearances. That might be the point that would achieve their goal. I don't want it to be reported. I just want the people closest to me to be able to vouch for this happening later, if something were to happen.

Like: ""take your pills and overdose and this will go away, take your pills and overdose and it will be ok."" Like fucking creepy nursery rhymes about how to kill myself. Goddamnit, it's the creepiest shit ever. It progressed from creepy rhyming advice on how to kill myself, to eventually morphing into other crazy messages that were clearly trying to lure me out of the house at night. Like: ""I'm right out here, come out to the front door, open it. Walk past the pool. I'm in the barn, come out to the barn and find me."" Creepy. Ass. Shit. Creepiest. Shit. Ever. I've lived through some fucking crazy Mossad level psyops. I've had my detailed medical records quoted to my face. This new shit is the creepiest shit ever. Like what would I fucking find if I was stupid enough to walk out to our barn in the middle of the night, just because some anonymous asshole asked me to? Fuck, no, I'm not going out there, stop asking. And asking me to come out to the barn... how the cameras are currently set up... you'd see footage of me walking out to the barn by myself, and you would not see anyone approaching the barn from the back. There would just be footage of me walking out there by myself on the cameras and then maybe my parents would find me hanging from the rafters in the morning. Goddamn, I'm not going out there, no matter how many times you send me messages baiting me to. It's the creepiest shit I have ever experienced, it has totally surpassed all of the previous insane creepy shit I've ever seen. No, I'm not going to take all my pills and overdose myself, no matter how many creepy rhyming messaged you send me asking me to, and I'm also not going to walk outside to the barn at night to come to you, fucking stop asking me to, goddamn it. I dunno. It's maybe the ground work to frame a suicide. Just ask McLandish. Oh wait, you can't, he's dead, of a supposed suicide.

I'm bubbly and friendly and silly, which I think should be more paletable than my serious, deep thinking, science loving side for strangers. Tho I have often heard people calling me ""crazy"" and multiple people casually mentioning that I have no self respect.

I joined a weight lifting group because it's one area that I can do better than the average person at, without trying too hard. 
The group causes me so much stress tho. Iv been chastised for being too silly. But I find it overstimulating. I stopped having pre workout, I stopped drinking coffee, I bought CBD oil to take beforehand to calm my nervous system and I wear Loop earplugs so I am less over stimulated. 
My coach tells me to fire up more, so I tried a few approaches but he said I was being too silly so I have tried to be less stimulated, and overall reduce my personal sense of humiliation. 

I try to keep to myself but also be present, today my coach said ""that was a good workout"" and I said ""yeah? What did u do?"" Thinking he was talking about his morning, but him and another girl laughed at me saying I thought I had done a workout even tho I hadn't started yet. 

Once girls were whispering in front of me and I said it dysregulated me but he just told me it's all in my head... and then today he was talking and I could barely hear because of my noise cancelling headphones and when I looked up he said ""we aren't whispering about you"" 

I just feel like the joke is always on me. I'm a single mother with no family and no time to myself and the other girls on the team with partners and kids in school and day care make comments about my parenting and my child while also undermining my struggles. 

What am I supposed to do, to not be offended by the casual bullying and not make a fool of myself? 

I need some kind of a guidebook about how to be a happy beta or whatever because part of me feels like I want to be treated like a baby or something and that's obviously not how teams work 

Edit: just saw the message from the bot and thought I would clarify:

Can anyone give me a list of specific behaviours to apply to a group setting with the above vibes.

When someone is rude, am I meant to smile and ignore it? If so, what kind of smile makes you not look weak and stupid.


Should I try to listen to everyone or ignore everyone or is there some kind of in between I can know about. 

I know it might seem silly but I would actuallt love just a bunch of general dot points.

I've been racking my head for a little while trying to think of some solutions, here's what I've seen and what I think of them, give me any thoughts, new ideas/solutions, personal experiences (as a server owner/admin, or a player), or ways that I could achieve stated ideas well/better:

\*Bountiful:

Seems like a cool solution, but I'm not quite sure how to set it up, and I don't know if this is what I'm looking for, but it's worth giving a shot. If you know how to set it up, and make it **balanced** then let me know!

\*Ores:

Mining ores and crafting, smelting, or refining them in some way seems like a good solution, as it takes time, but isn't too complicated, a lot of the players on my server have little to no experience with the create mod, and making something as simple (yet complicated) as currency not complicated to make, would be preferable, although it **must be time consuming** as I don't want a bazillion coins to randomly appear because someone went mining like crazy for 3 hours (Some of my players are tryhards and will do as such, but some aren't, and I want it to be fair and equal to both types of players) I know how to use basic MCreator (I know, I know, another crappy ore mod for minecraft, but at least it would be for a good use, and not just more armor and tools)

\*Recipes:

This one is iffy, but I can see it working, especially with a mod like [Create: Numismatics Crafting](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-numismatics-crafting) which adds recipes and cleaning processes to the mod. It seems difficult enough, requiring you to wash the dirty coins, and it also requires you to craft cogs, but it can be **automated really easy**, which is something I want to steer clear of, I can see this working great if I change the recipes to require a modded placeholder ore, or one that I make using MCreator, as this would make it difficult, but not like it requires in depth create knowledge (Within reach of new players because of the basic create mod ponders) and it also requires grinding. I think I would make it so that only basic currency amounts (Such as spurs, bevels, or even sprockets if I get excited) could be crafted, and only one type globally could be crafted. This would make the more valuable ones take even more time and effort, and therefore everything stays balanced.

\*Automatic amounts at certain intervels:

I don't really like this idea but it's worth mentioning, as it is a *solution*. Generally this seems like a bad idea, because if you just spend a bunch of time not buying anything, then you get rich... for doing nothing... sounds like some sort of scam ad, right? (Getting rich while playing a game lol) point is, it's not a good solution, but if it comes down to it, it does work.

**One last thing:**

On top of this I would plan to give every player a starting amount of currency (when they join the game) to get the economy flowing, and to make it easy for people to start trading, this would also incentivize people using the currency in the first place instead of just bartering.

P.S. I want this to be a place for people to come to in the future when looking for ideas on how to set up currencies, so if you have an idea, please take your time when replying on the main thread, so the ideas are as understandable as possible. Also, I wrote this at 12am and have not drunk any coffee, so if this has some weird grammar mistakes, I am sorry, I'll try to fix them tomorrow, and thanks in advance for any ideas or help!",11,1750136725.0,feedthebeast,4,1.0,False

I picked up a Breville (Sage) Smart Grinder Pro for super cheap and I‚Äôm trying to bring it back to life for my office coffee setup.

The problem is the front buttons the start button and the cups/shot button only work sometimes. Doesn‚Äôt matter how hard or soft I press them, they just won‚Äôt respond most of the time. Every now and then they‚Äôll randomly work again. It‚Äôs super inconsistent.

The grind time dial (the small one on the front) also doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything at all. But the grind size dial on the side works fine, and the display powers on like normal.

Feels like it might be something electrical, like a bad contact, dirty button, or maybe something on the board? I haven‚Äôt opened it up yet but I‚Äôm comfortable with soldering and repairs if needed.

I attached a video showing one of the rare times the cups/shot and start buttons actually respond. If anyone‚Äôs had this issue before or knows where I should start, I‚Äôd really appreciate the help.

I carry a gun, legally, because my name and face tend to attract attention from the type of people who also carry guns and don‚Äôt mind using them. I live alone, usually sleep alone, and do not possess the patience and understanding necessary to maintain friendships. The law is my life, always consuming and occasionally fulfilling.

They don‚Äôt tell you in law school that one day you may find yourself defending a person charged with a crime so heinous that otherwise peaceful citizens feel driven to take up arms and threaten to kill the accused, his lawyer, and even the judge.¬† But I‚Äôve been threatened before. It‚Äôs part of being a rogue lawyer, a subspecialty of the profession that I more or less fell into ten years ago. When I finished law school, jobs were scarce. I reluctantly took a part-time position in the City‚Äôs public defender‚Äôs office. From there I landed in a small, unprofitable firm that handled only criminal defense. After a few years, that firm blew up and I was on my own, out on the street with plenty of others, scrambling to make a buck.¬† One case put me on the map. I can‚Äôt say it made me famous because, seriously, how can you say a lawyer is famous in a city of a million people? Plenty of local hacks think they‚Äôre famous. They smile from billboards as they beg for your bankruptcy and swagger in television ads as they seem deeply concerned about your personal injuries, but they‚Äôre forced to pay for their own publicity. Not me.  
  
¬† The cheap motels change each week. I‚Äôm in the middle of a trial in a dismal, backwater, redneck town called Milo, two hours from where I live in the City. I am defending a brain-damaged eighteen-year-old dropout who‚Äôs charged with killing two little girls in one of the most evil crimes I‚Äôve ever seen, and I‚Äôve seen plenty. My clients are almost always guilty, so I don‚Äôt waste a lot of time wringing my hands about whether they get what they deserve. In this case, though, Gardy is not guilty, not that it matters. It does not. What‚Äôs important in Milo these days is that Gardy gets convicted and sentenced to death and executed as soon as possible so that the town can feel better about itself and move on. Move on to where, exactly? Hell if I know, nor do I care. This place has been moving backward for fifty years, and one lousy verdict will not change its course. I‚Äôve read and heard it said that Milo needs ‚Äúclosure,‚Äù whatever that means. You‚Äôd have to be an idiot to believe this town will somehow grow and prosper and become more tolerant as soon as Gardy gets the needle.  
  
¬† My job is layered and complicated, and at the same time it‚Äôs quite simple. I‚Äôm being paid by the State to provide a first-class defense to a defendant charged with capital murder, and this requires me to fight and claw and raise hell in a courtroom where no one is listening. Gardy was essentially convicted the day he was arrested, and his trial is only a formality. The dumb and desperate cops trumped up the charges and fabricated the evidence. The prosecutor knows this but has no spine and is up for reelection next year. The judge is asleep. The jurors are basically nice, simple people, wide-eyed at the process and ever so anxious to believe the lies their proud authorities are producing on the witness stand.  
  
¬† Milo has its share of cheap motels but I can‚Äôt stay there. I would be lynched or flayed or burned at the stake, or if I‚Äôm lucky a sniper would hit me between the eyes and it would be over in a flash. The state police are providing protection during the trial, but I get the clear impression these guys are just not into it. They view me the same way most people do. I‚Äôm a long-haired roguish zealot sick enough to fight for the rights of child killers and the like.  
  
¬† My current motel is a Hampton Inn located twenty-five minutes from Milo. It costs $60 a night and the State will reimburse me. Next door is Partner, a hulking, heavily armed guy who wears black suits and takes me everywhere. Partner is my driver, bodyguard, confidant, paralegal, caddie, and only friend. I earned his loyalty when a jury found him not guilty of killing an undercover narcotics officer. We walked out of the courtroom arm in arm and have been inseparable ever since. On at least two occasions, off-duty cops have tried to kill him. On one occasion, they came after me.  
  
¬† We‚Äôre still standing. Or perhaps I should say we‚Äôre still ducking.  
  
¬† 2.  
  
¬† At 8:00 a.m. Partner knocks on my door. It‚Äôs time to go. We say our good mornings and climb into my vehicle, which is a large black Ford cargo van, heavily customized for my needs. Since it doubles as an office, the rear seats have been rearranged around a small table that folds into a wall. There is a sofa where I often spend the night. All windows are shaded and bulletproof. It has a television, stereo system, Internet, refrigerator, bar, a couple of guns, and a change of clothes. I sit in the front with Partner and we unwrap fast-food sausage biscuits as we leave the parking lot. An unmarked state police car moves in front of us for the escort to Milo. There is another one behind us. The last death threat was two days ago and came by e-mail.  
  
¬† Partner does not speak unless spoken to. I didn‚Äôt make this rule but I adore it. He is not the least bit bothered by long gaps in the conversation, nor am I. After years of saying next to nothing, we have learned to communicate with nods and winks and silence. Halfway to Milo I open a file and start taking notes.  
  
¬† The double murder was so gruesome no local lawyer would touch it. Then Gardy was arrested, and one look at Gardy and you know he‚Äôs guilty. Long hair dyed jet-black, an astonishing collection of piercings above the neck and tattoos below, matching steel earrings, cold pale eyes, and a smirk that says, ‚ÄúOkay, I did it, now what?‚Äù In its very first story, the Milo newspaper described him as ‚Äúa member of a satanic cult who has a record of molesting children.‚Äù  
  
¬† How‚Äôs that for honest and unbiased reporting? He was never a member of a satanic cult and the child molestation thing is not what it seems. But from that moment Gardy was guilty, and I still marvel at the fact that we‚Äôve made it this far. They wanted to string him up months ago.  
  
¬† Needless to say, every lawyer in Milo locked his door and unplugged her phone. There is no public defender system in the town‚Äîit‚Äôs too small‚Äîand the indigent cases are doled out by the judge. There is an unwritten rule that the younger lawyers in town take these low-paying cases because (1) someone has to and (2) the older lawyers did so when they were younger. But no one would agree to defend Gardy, and, to be honest, I can‚Äôt really blame them. It‚Äôs their town and their lives, and to rub shoulders with such a twisted murderer could do real damage to a career.  
  
¬† As a society, we adhere to the belief in a fair trial for a person accused of a serious crime, but some of us struggle when it comes to the business of providing a competent lawyer to guarantee said fair trial. Lawyers like me live with the question ‚ÄúBut how do you represent such scum?‚Äù  
  
¬† I offer a quick ‚ÄúSomeone has to‚Äù as I walk away.  
  
¬† Do we really want fair trials? No, we do not. We want justice, and quickly. And justice is whatever we deem it to be on a case-by-case basis.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs just as well that we don‚Äôt believe in fair trials because we damned sure don‚Äôt have them. The presumption of innocence is now the presumption of guilt. The burden of proof is a travesty because the proof is often lies. Gui  
lt beyond a reasonable doubt means if he probably did it, then let‚Äôs get him off the streets.  
  
¬† At any rate, the lawyers ran for the hills and Gardy had no one. It‚Äôs a commentary, sad or otherwise, on my reputation that I soon got the phone call. In this end of the state, it is now well known in legal circles that if you can‚Äôt find anybody else, call Sebastian Rudd. He‚Äôll defend anybody!  
  
¬† When Gardy was arrested, a mob showed up outside the jail and screamed for justice. When the police perp-walked him to a van for the ride to the courthouse, the mob cursed him and threw tomatoes and rocks. This was thoroughly reported by the local newspaper and even made the City‚Äôs evening news (there is no network station based in Milo, only a low-end cable outfit). I howled for a change of venue, pleaded with the judge to move the trial at least a hundred miles away so we could hopefully find some jurors who hadn‚Äôt thrown stuff at the kid, or at the least cursed him over dinner. But we were denied. All of my pretrial motions were denied.  
  
¬† Again, the town wants justice. The town wants closure.  
  
¬† There is no mob to greet me and my van as we pull in to a short driveway behind the courthouse, but some of the usual actors are here. They huddle behind a police barricade not far away and hold their sad signs that say such clever things as ‚ÄúHang the Baby Killer,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSatan Is Waiting,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrud Rudd out of Milo!‚Äù There are about a dozen of these pathetic souls, just waiting to jeer at me and, more important, to show their hatred to Gardy, who will arrive at the same place in about five minutes. During the early days of the trial, this little crowd attracted cameras and a few of these people made it into the newspapers, along with their signs. This, of course, encouraged them and they‚Äôve been here every morning since. Fat Susie holds the ‚ÄúCrud Rudd‚Äù sign and looks like she wants to shoot me. Bullet Bob claims to be a relative of one of the dead girls and was quoted as saying something to the effect that a trial was a waste of time.  
  
¬† He was right about that, I‚Äôm afraid.  
  
¬† When the van stops, Partner hurries around to my door, where he‚Äôs met by three young deputies about his size. I step out and am properly shielded, then I‚Äôm whisked into the rear door of the courthouse as Bullet Bob calls me a whore. Another safe entry. I‚Äôm not aware of any case in modern times in which a criminal defense attorney was gunned down while entering a courthouse in the middle of a trial. Nevertheless, I have resigned myself to the likelihood that I could well be the first.  
  
¬† We climb a narrow rear staircase that‚Äôs off-limits to everyone else, and I‚Äôm led to a small windowless room where they once held prisoners waiting to see the judge. A few minutes later, Gardy arrives in one piece. Partner steps outside and closes the door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow ya doing?‚Äù I ask when we are alone.  
  
¬† He smiles and rubs his wrists, unshackled for a few hours. ‚ÄúOkay, I guess. Didn‚Äôt sleep much.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt shower either because he‚Äôs afraid to shower. He tries it occasionally but they won‚Äôt turn on the hot water. So Gardy reeks of stale sweat and dirty sheets, and I‚Äôm thankful he‚Äôs far enough away from the jury. The black dye is slowly leaving his hair and each day it gets lighter, and his skin gets paler. He‚Äôs changing colors in front of the jury, another clear sign of his animalistic capabilities and satanic bent.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs gonna happen today?‚Äù he asks, with an almost childlike curiosity. He has an IQ of 70, just barely enough to be prosecuted and put to death.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMore of the same, Gardy, I‚Äôm afraid. Just more of the same.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you make them stop lying?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I cannot.‚Äù  
  
¬† The State has no physical evidence linking Gardy to the murders. Zero. So, instead of evaluating its lack of evidence and reconsidering its case, the State is doing what it often does. It‚Äôs plowing ahead with lies and fabricated testimony.  
  
¬† Gardy has spent two weeks in the courtroom, listening to the lies, closing his eyes while slowly shaking his head. He‚Äôs able to shake his head for hours at a time, and the jurors must think he‚Äôs crazy. I‚Äôve told him to stop, to sit up, to take a pen and scribble something on a legal pad as if he has a brain and wants to fight back, to win. But he simply cannot do this and I cannot argue with my client in the courtroom. I‚Äôve also told him to cover his arms and neck to hide the tattoos, but he‚Äôs proud of them. I‚Äôve told him to lose the piercings, but he insists on being who he is. The bright folks who run the Milo jail forbid piercings of all types, unless, of course, you‚Äôre Gardy and you‚Äôre headed back to the courtroom. In that case, stick ‚Äôem all over your face. Look as sick and creepy and satanic as possible, Gardy, so that your peers will have no trouble with your guilt.  
  
¬† On a nail is a hanger with the same white shirt and khaki pants he‚Äôs worn every day. I paid for this cheap ensemble. He slowly unzips the orange jail jumpsuit and steps out of it. He does not wear underwear, something I noticed the first day of the trial and have tried to ignore since. He slowly gets dressed. ‚ÄúSo much lying,‚Äù he says.  
  
¬† And he‚Äôs right. The State has called nineteen witnesses so far and not a single one resisted the temptation to embellish a bit, or to lie outright. The pathologist who did the autopsies at the state crime lab told the jury the two little victims had drowned, but he also added that ‚Äúblunt force trauma‚Äù to their heads was a contributing factor. It‚Äôs a better story for the prosecution if the jury believes the girls were raped and beaten senseless before being tossed into the pond. There‚Äôs no physical proof they were in any way sexually molested, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped the prosecution from making this a part of its case. I haggled with the pathologist for three hours, but it‚Äôs tough arguing with an expert, even an incompetent one.  
  
¬† Since the State has no evidence, it is forced to manufacture some. The most outrageous testimony came from a jailhouse snitch they call Smut, an appropriate nickname. Smut is an accomplished courtroom liar who testifies all the time and will say whatever the prosecutors want him to say. In Gardy‚Äôs case, Smut was back in jail on a drug charge and looking at ten years in prison. The cops needed some testimony, and, not surprisingly, Smut was at their disposal. They fed him details of the crimes, then transferred Gardy from a regional jail to a county jail where Smut was locked up. Gardy had no idea why he was being transferred and had no clue that he was walking into a trap. (This happened before I got involved.) They threw Gardy into a small cell with Smut, who was anxious to talk and wanted to help in any way. He claimed to hate the cops and know some good lawyers. He‚Äôd also read about the murders of the two girls and had a hunch he knew who really killed them. Since Gardy knew nothing about the murders, he had nothing to add to the conversation. Nonetheless, within twenty-four hours Smut claimed he‚Äôd heard a full confession. The cops yanked him out of the cell and Gardy never saw him again, until trial. As a witness, Smut cleaned up nicely, wore a shirt and tie and short hair, and hid his tattoos from the jury. In amazing detail, he replayed Gardy‚Äôs account of how he stalked the two girls into the woods, knocked them off their bikes, gagged and bound them, then tortured, molested, and beat them before tossing them into the pond. In Smut‚Äôs version, Gardy was high on drugs and had been listening to heavy metal.  
  
¬† It was quite a performance. I knew it was all a lie, as did Gardy and Smut, along with the cops and prosecutors, and I suspect the judge had his doubts too. Nevertheless, the jurors swallowed it in disgust and glared with hatred at my client, who absorbed it with his eyes closed and his head shaking, no, no, no. Smut‚Äôs testimony was so breathtakingly gruesome and rich with details that it was hard to believe, at times, that he was really fabricating it. No one can lie like that!  
  
¬† I hammered at Smut for eight full hours, one long exhausting day. The judge was cranky and the jurors were bleary-eyed, but I could have kept going for a week. I asked Smut how many times he‚Äôd testified in criminal trials. He said maybe twice. I pulled out the records, refreshed his memory, and went through the nine other trials in which he‚Äôd performed the same miracle for our honest and fair-minded prosecutors. With his muddled memory somewhat restored, I asked him how many times he‚Äôd had his sentenc  
e reduced by the prosecutors after lying for them in court. He said never, so I went through each of the nine cases again. I produced the paperwork. I made it perfectly clear to everyone, especially the jurors, that Smut was a lying, serial snitch who swapped bogus testimony for leniency.  
  
¬† I confess‚ÄîI get angry in court, and this is often detrimental. I blew my cool with Smut and hammered him so relentlessly that some of the jurors became sympathetic. The judge finally told me to move on, but I didn‚Äôt. I hate liars, especially those who swear to tell the truth and then fabricate testimony to convict my client. I yelled at Smut and the judge yelled at me, and at times it seemed as though everyone was yelling. This did not help Gardy‚Äôs cause.  
  
¬† You would think the prosecutor might break up his parade of liars with a credible witness, but this would require some intelligence. His next witness was another inmate, another druggie who testified he was in the hallway near Gardy‚Äôs cell and heard him confess to Smut.  
  
¬† Lies on top of lies.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease make them stop,‚Äù Gardy says.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying, Gardy. I‚Äôm doing the best I can. We need to go.‚Äù  
  
¬† 3.  
  
¬† A deputy leads us into the courtroom, which is again packed with people and heavy with a layer of tense apprehension. This is the tenth day of testimony, and I now believe there is absolutely nothing else happening in this backwater town. We are the entertainment! The courtroom is packed from gavel to gavel and they‚Äôre lined up against the walls. Thank God the weather is cool or we‚Äôd all be soaked with sweat.  
  
¬† Every capital murder trial requires the presence of at least two lawyers for the defense. My co-counsel, or ‚Äúsecond chair,‚Äù is Trots, a thick, dull boy who ought to burn his law license and curse the day he ever dreamed of showing his face in a courtroom. He‚Äôs from a small town twenty miles away, far enough, he thought, to shield him from the unpleasantness of getting caught up in Gardy‚Äôs nightmare. Trots volunteered to handle the preliminary matters, intending to jump ship if a trial became a reality. His plans have not worked out to suit him. He screwed up the preliminaries as only a rookie can, then tried to extricate himself. No go, said the judge. Trots then thought it might be an acceptable idea to sit in the second chair, gain some experience, feel the pressure of a real trial, and so on, but after several death threats he stopped trying. Death threats are just part of the daily grind for me, like the morning coffee and lying cops.  
  
¬† I‚Äôve filed three motions to remove Trots from the second chair. All denied, of course, so Gardy and I are stuck with a moron at our table who‚Äôs more of a hindrance than an assistant. Trots sits as far away as possible, though given Gardy‚Äôs current state of hygiene I can‚Äôt really blame him.  
  
¬† Gardy told me months ago that when he was first interviewed by Trots at the county jail the lawyer was shocked when Gardy claimed he was innocent. They even argued about it. How‚Äôs that for a vigorous defender? ¬†So Trots sits at the end of the table, his head buried in useless note taking, his eyes seeing nothing, his ears hearing nothing, but he feels the stares of all those sitting behind us who hate us and want to string us up with our client. Trots figures this too shall pass and he‚Äôll get on with his life and career the moment the trial is over. He is wrong. As soon as possible, I‚Äôll file an ethics complaint with the state bar association alleging Trots provided ‚Äúineffective assistance of counsel‚Äù before and during the trial. I‚Äôve done this before and I know how to make it stick. I‚Äôm fighting my own battles with the bar and I understand the game. After I get finished with Trots, he‚Äôll want to surrender his license and get a job at a used-car lot.  
  
¬† Gardy takes his seat in the middle of our table. Trots does not look at his client, nor does he speak.  
  
¬† Huver, the prosecutor, walks over and hands me a sheet of paper. There are no good mornings or hellos. We are so far beyond even the most benign pleasantries that a civilized grunt from either of us would be a surprise. I loathe this man the way he loathes me, but I have an advantage in the hating game. Almost monthly I deal with self-righteous prosecutors who lie, cheat, stonewall, cover up, ignore ethics, and do whatever it takes to get a conviction, even when they know the truth and the truth tells them they are wrong. So I know the breed, the ilk, the subclass of lawyer who‚Äôs above the law because he is the law. Huver, on the other hand, rarely deals with a rogue like me because, sadly for him, he doesn‚Äôt see many sensational cases, and almost none in which a defendant shows up with a pit bull for a protector. If he dealt with rabid defense lawyers more regularly, he might be more adept at hating us. For me, it‚Äôs a way of life.  
  
¬† I take the sheet of paper and say, ‚ÄúSo who‚Äôs your liar of the day?‚Äù  
  
¬† He says nothing and walks a few feet back to his table, where his little gang of assistants huddle importantly in their dark suits and ham it up for the home crowd. They are on display in this, the biggest show of their miserable backwater careers, and I often get the impression that everyone from the DA‚Äôs office who can walk, talk, wear a cheap suit, and carry a new briefcase is packed around the table to insure justice.  
  
¬† The bailiff barks, I stand, Judge Kaufman enters, then we sit. Gardy refuses to stand in homage to the great man. Initially, this really pissed off His Honor. On the first day of trial‚Äîit now seems like months ago‚Äîhe snapped at me, ‚ÄúMr. Rudd, would you please ask your client to stand?‚Äù  
  
¬† I did, and he refused. This embarrassed the judge and we discussed it later in his chambers. He threatened to hold my client in contempt and keep him in jail all day long during the trial. I tried to encourage this but let it slip that such an overreaction would be mentioned repeatedly on appeal.  
  
¬† Gardy wisely observed, ‚ÄúWhat can they do to me that they haven‚Äôt already done?‚Äù So each morning Judge Kaufman begins the ceremonies with a long, nasty scowl at my client, who‚Äôs usually slouched in his chair either picking at his nose ring or nodding with his eyes closed. It‚Äôs impossible to tell which one of us, lawyer or client, Kaufman despises the most. Like the rest of Milo, he‚Äôs been convinced for a long time that Gardy is guilty. And, like everybody else in the courtroom, he has loathed me from day one.  
  
¬† Doesn‚Äôt matter. In this line of work you rarely have allies and you quickly make enemies.  
  
¬† Since he‚Äôs up for reelection next year, as is Huver, Kaufman slaps on his phony politician‚Äôs smile and welcomes everyone to his courtroom for another interesting day in the pursuit of the truth. Based on the calculations I made one day during lunch when the courtroom was empty, there are about 310 people sitting behind me. Except for Gardy‚Äôs mother and sister, everyone is fervently praying for a conviction, with a quick execution to follow. It‚Äôs up to Judge Kaufman to deliver. This is the judge who has so far allowed every word of bogus testimony offered by the State. At times it seems as though he‚Äôs afraid he might lose a vote or two if he sustains one of my objections.  
  
¬† When everyone is in place, they bring in the jury. There are fourteen people crammed in the box‚Äîthe chosen twelve plus a couple of alternates in case someone gets sick or does something wrong. They are not sequestered (though I requested this), so they are free to go home at night and trash Gardy and me over dinner. Late each afternoon, they are warned by His Honor not to utter a single word about the case, but you can almost hear them yakking as they drive away. Their decision has been made. If they voted right now, before we offer a single witness in defense, they would find him guilty and demand his execution. Then they would return home as heroes and talk about this trial for the rest of their lives. When Gardy gets the needle, they will take special pride in their crucial role in finding justice. They will be elevated in Milo. They will be congratulated, stopped on the streets, recognized at church.  
  
¬† Still sappy, Kaufman welcomes them back, thanks them for their civic service, asks gravely whether anyone tried to contact them in an effort to gain influence. This usually prompts a few looks in my direction, as if I have the time, energy, and stupidity to slink around the streets of Milo at night stalking these same jurors so I can (1) bribe them, (2) intimidate them, or (3) plead with them. It‚Äôs now gospel that I‚Äôm the only crook in the room, in spite of the torrent of sins committed by the other side.  
  
¬† The truth is, if I had the money, the time, and the personnel, I would bribe and/or intimidate every juror. When the State, with its limitless resources, commences a fraudulent case and cheats at every turn, then cheating is legitimized. There is no level playing field. There is no fairness. The only honorable alternative for a lawyer fighting to save an innocent client is to cheat in defense.  
  
¬† However, if a defense lawyer is caught cheating, he or she gets nailed with sanctions by the court, reprimanded by the state bar association, maybe even indicted. If a prosecutor gets caught cheating, he either gets reelected or elevated to the bench. Our system never holds a bad prosecutor accountable.  
  
¬† The jurors assure His Honor that all is well. ‚ÄúMr. Huver,‚Äù he announces with great solemnity, ‚Äúplease call your next witness.‚Äù Next up for the State is a fundamentalist preacher who converted the old Chrysler dealership into the World Harvest Temple and is drawing crowds to his daily prayer-a-thons. I watched him once on local cable; once is enough. His claim to fame here is that he says he confronted Gardy in the middle of a late-night youth service. According to his version, Gardy was wearing a T-shirt advertising a heavy metal rock group and conveying some vague satanic message, and this T-shirt was allowing the devil to infiltrate the service. Spiritual warfare was in the air, and God was unhappy with things. With divine direction, the preacher finally located the source of evil in the crowd, stopped the music, stormed back to where Gardy was sitting, and kicked him out of the building.  
  
¬† Gardy says he‚Äôs never been near the church. Further, Gardy claims he‚Äôs never seen the inside of any church in all of his eighteen years. His mother confirms this. As they say out here in the country, Gardy‚Äôs family is severely ‚Äúunchurched.‚Äù  
  
¬† Why this is allowed as testimony in a capital murder case is thoroughly inconceivable. It is ridiculous and borders on stupidity. Assuming there is a conviction, all of this crap will be reviewed in about two years by a dispassionate appellate court two hundred miles away. Those judges, only slightly more intelligent than Kaufman but anything is an improvement, will take a dim view of this redneck preacher telling his trumped-up story about an altercation that supposedly took place some thirteen months before the murders.  
  
¬† I object. Overruled. I object, angrily. I‚Äôm overruled, angrily.  
  
¬† Huver, though, is desperate to keep Satan involved in his theory of the case. Judge Kaufman opened the gates days ago and anything is welcome. However, he‚Äôll slam them as soon as I start calling witnesses. We‚Äôll be lucky to get a hundred words into the record.  
  
¬† The preacher has an unpaid tax bill in another state. He doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôve found it, and thus we‚Äôll have some fun on cross-examination. Not that it will matter; it will not. This jury is done. Gardy is a monster who deserves to  
go to hell. Their job is to speed him along.  
  
¬† He leans over long enough to whisper, ‚ÄúMr. Rudd, I swear I‚Äôve never been to church.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nod and smile because this is all I can do. A defense lawyer cannot always believe his clients, but when Gardy says he‚Äôs never been to church, I believe him.  
  
¬† The preacher has a temper and I soon stoke it. I use the unpaid tax bill to really irritate him, and once he‚Äôs pissed he stays that way. I lead him into arguments over the inerrancy of scripture, the Trinity, the apocalypse, speaking in tongues, playing with snakes, drinking poison, and the pervasiveness of satanic cults in the Milo area. Huver yells objections and Kaufman sustains them. At one point the preacher, pious and red-faced, closes his eyes and raises both hands as high as possible. Instinctively, I freeze and cower and look at the ceiling as if a lightning bolt is coming. Later, he calls me an atheist and says I‚Äôm going to hell.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you have the authority to send folks to hell?‚Äù I fire back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGod tells me you‚Äôre going to hell.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen put Him on the loudspeaker so we can all hear.‚Äù  
  
¬† Two jurors actually chuckle at this. Kaufman has had enough. He raps the gavel and calls for lunch. We‚Äôve wasted the morning with this sanctimonious little prick and his bogus testimony, but he‚Äôs not the first local to wedge himself into the trial. The town is filled with wannabe heroes.

My responsibilities are to manage the home front and keep things clean, tidy, have dinner ready, groceries in fridge, etc. I have no issue with these being my responsibilities only I am clearly having a hard time meeting the needs of my partner bc we keep fighting about the same things. 

First i‚Äôll walk you through my average day. My son contact naps, he will not let me do anything else we have tried it all. I refuse to do CIO method, and at this point transitioning him is very difficult. nonetheless, the naps he take are my time to relax, because during his wake periods is when i get to work on the house. I like our routine being this way and just want help balancing it.
Those wake periods average from 1-3 hours. Depends on if he is teething, still tired, just grumpy, etc. He is a total momma‚Äôs boy so he often wants me in his bubble. 
His naps average also from 30 minutes to 3 hours. I absolutely can never predict what kind of nap he will take. but all i know, is however long it is, is however long i‚Äôm down for the count. Meaning, if he takes a 3 hour nap, that‚Äôs 3 hours less in the day for me to be productive. so when he wakes up from those naps, i immediately get to work doing stuff. Although, this often gets interrupted multiple times by him crying because he wants me, wants to be held, wants to play, etc. 

When his dad gets home, (average 6:30-7pm), is our time we eat dinner, and spend time watching a show or movie together, and from the time he gets home to the time we go to bed, all housework basically stops with the exception of before bed tidying that I always do because i can‚Äôt stand having a bunch of stuff slung around and not put away. but like if there‚Äôs laundry that could be put up, dishes done, floors swept, etc, it doesn‚Äôt get done once he gets home, by either one of us. 

He works long days, 10-12 hours selling cars, only gets 4 days off a month. he gets home and is exhausted. wants to kick his feet up. which I completely understand. I would feel the same way, and in fact I do because 24 hours a day, 7 days a week I am taking care of the baby and the house. 

So basically my 9-6/7 everyday is super inconsistent because of having a baby, and I can‚Äôt seem to stay on top of all the household chores well enough. 

yesterday, we both complained because i hadn‚Äôt kept up on the floors this past week and there was just a lot of dirt dragged inside so i promised him I‚Äôd sweep and mop. So i did that today. I also did a bunch of dishes today because we made a lot of dishes yesterday that didn‚Äôt get done before bed. dishes often sit overnight and then i do them the next day. well after I cooked dinner, there was a bunch of dishes again, and I verbally complained just because i was frustrated at having to do a bunch of dishes again. It maybe would‚Äôve been nice if he jumped in and helped me wash dinner dishes. but i didn‚Äôt ask him to. So then we are talking about our new coffee maker, and how we need to make ice to make some iced coffee with it and try it out. I was actively cleaning up in the kitchen, putting things away from my trip to the store today, I had repotted my mint plant so I cleaned up all of that. It annoyed him that I made a mess repotting my plant and that I was choosing to do it at night. i got annoyed at him talking about wanting ice because I felt like I had done all the dishes, did the floors, piled up some more dishes making dinner for us, i‚Äôm taking the time to do one thing for myself and it was repot my plant because i‚Äôve taken up gardening and really enjoy it. I wasn‚Äôt worried about the mess because i‚Äôm an adult and knew i‚Äôd clean it, besides i was making a mess on the floor that I myself cleaned, not him so i didn‚Äôt understand why it bothered him. So i said okay you could come in here and fill the ice trays like that‚Äôs one thing you could do for me that would be nice seeing as i‚Äôm doing all this other stuff in here right now. and he took that as me saying he never does anything. he said he felt like i said it snarkily, which there‚Äôs a chance a little bit of frustration came out in it because I was getting annoyed that he was wanting it done and essentially expected me to handle it when he could‚Äôve came in there and done it for the both of us. he feels like he doesn‚Äôt ask for much to be done, but that i don‚Äôt consistently get it done. which i will be honest, i lack consistency. 

For example, his laundry days are wed and sun, some weeks I get it done those days, some weeks it‚Äôs a thursday and a Saturday because I have simply forgotten to do it. Or because I had an intense day with our son and most days I am so tired I don‚Äôt even know what day it is and before I realize it the day has passed me by. I recognize how that can be frustrating, however in all the time we‚Äôve been together, I‚Äôve never dared say a thing about how we are frequently broke and don‚Äôt have much money. but he will make comments about the dishes being in the sink, or his laundry still being in the dryer, or the floors being dirty, or there being stuff of mine on the bathroom counter needing to be put away. it feels like it is always something. and then on weeks where I am consistently able to stay on top of things, because our son‚Äôs not as cranky, and is sleeping better which means i‚Äôm getting more sleep as well, it goes completely unnoticed and when a week comes where i might slack a bit from being tired, he acts like i never do anything. 
His problem is the lack of consistency, which pisses me off considering his lack of consistency with making money, yet I never complain about it the way he does with the house. all these things that so many other SAHMs get to go do, like get their nails or hair done, go shopping, go on lunch dates with their mom or friends, etc, i don‚Äôt get to do those things. Yet, i never complain.  

I don‚Äôt know what to do to stop having this same dumb conversation. I feel like he wants the cake and eat it too. I feel like he is just resentful towards me being home, and not having the things consistently taken care of that he wants me to, while he is at work to pay our bills. but I feel that it isn‚Äôt a fair assessment of what I contribute to the house. I feel that just because it isn‚Äôt consistent enough for him doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not there and doesn‚Äôt mean it justifies his consistent complaining about me not meeting his expectations. because he never comes home to a messy house. I am constantly tidying up, putting things away, wiping counters. The stuff I am inconsistent on is like some weeks i‚Äôll sweep and mop a couple days, some weeks just once, some weeks i‚Äôll have the dishes done daily, some days the dishes might sit the whole day till he‚Äôs home and then they get done. but he never has to come home to a messy or dirty house it always looks put together. 

I just need advice on how to create a balance. am i in the wrong? I feel like i am trying hard and i‚Äôm also trying to create a routine where i‚Äôm happy. i‚Äôm inconsistent for him, but for me i‚Äôm just trying to survive right now, so this is what i‚Äôm happy with. but he clearly isn‚Äôt, and then i get unhappy and resentful bc of all the comments he will make. 

I also just want to say he is an amazing man, and an amazing dad, we are just both young, trying to figure it all out together, got slung into parenthood after a year together, so we are just going through all the motions of living together and learning one another the hardest way possible lol. We are both blinded by our own things and own ways and just gotta figure out how to meet in the middle, which is what i want advice for.",1,1750136189.0,Marriage,5,1.0,False

I choose Ring Sang over Liu Sang because Wrath Res doesn't heal nearly as much as Ring passive due to burn + tremor.

Lei Sault will have Chain of Others, Regret, Capote (uptie 4), and Mircalla.

I plan on going down the Poise Route, since a lot of their gifts are about offense levels and such (and also because it's also the most free of the archetype to build multi-type with).

But mainly because of Huge Gift Sack, which gives 2 Protection every turn.

For the starting pack, I'll try to aim for Coffee and Crane immediately + Painkiller.

Along the side, I'll try to grab charge barriers and other healing gifts.

2nd pack will aim for chickens for an infinite burn count + the speed clash power gift (since Lei Sault will be crazy fast due to all the speed buffs).

Asking a major donor for money is about **building trust, showing impact, and making a clear, respectful ask**. Here's a solid approach, broken down into simple steps:

# ‚úÖ 1. Do Your Homework

Before you ask, make sure:

* They **have the capacity** to give (use wealth screening like [NPOAuthority.com](https://npoauthority.com)).
* They‚Äôve **given to similar causes**.
* You know what **they care about**‚Äîprograms, naming opportunities, legacy giving, etc.

# ‚úÖ 2. Build the Relationship First

Major donors give to **people** and **impact**, not just organizations. Start with:

* A tour or site visit
* A lunch or coffee chat
* A thank-you call if they gave in the past

>

# ‚úÖ 3. Share a Powerful Story or Need

Focus on a **specific program** or project and tie it to their interests.

>

# ‚úÖ 4. Make the Ask ‚Äì Be Clear, Confident, and Respectful

Use a direct and tailored ask:

>

Or if it‚Äôs a stretch:

>

# ‚úÖ 5. Pause and Listen

After the ask, stop talking. Give them space to respond. Be ready to:

* Answer questions
* Clarify impact
* Offer giving options (pledge, stock gift, naming opportunity, etc.)

# ‚úÖ 6. Follow Up Thoughtfully

* Send a **thank-you**, no matter the outcome.
* If they say ‚Äúmaybe,‚Äù set a time to reconnect.
* Keep them updated on progress and impact.

I‚Äôm posting here to understand if this kind of situation is normal, and whether there‚Äôs anything I should've or can do differently.

I came across a role that strongly aligned with my background and interests, so I messaged the recruiter to express interest and asked if they could facilitate a short meeting or coffee chat with the hiring manager. Within a few hours, the recruiter replied that the hiring manager wasn‚Äôt interested in speaking with me, saying I didn‚Äôt check all the boxes.

Still curious about the team, I independently messaged the hiring manager. To my surprise, he quickly agreed to chat. We had a great conversation ‚Äî he immediately showed strong interest and said he wanted to bring me in for interviews. I soon sent over my resume.

I followed up every week over the next three weeks. Each time, the hiring manager told me he had reached out to the recruiter to arrange interviews but hadn‚Äôt received a response. Eventually, he told me another candidate had accepted the role and that he was sorry I was never given a chance to interview ‚Äî and again mentioned he had followed up with the recruiter multiple times without success.

This left me wondering:

1. How much power does a recruiter have to block a candidate, even when the hiring manager is clearly interested?
2. Could there be other factors at play ‚Äî e.g., internal politics, over-filtering by recruiting, vetting me over social media impressions, or something else I‚Äôm missing?
3. Is it common for recruiters to override hiring managers in internal hiring situations?
4. Can I take some steps to hold the recruiter accountable, like making an internal complaint to the HR?

This experience left me feeling demoralized. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if there are implicit biases or unspoken filters being applied. I‚Äôm not jumping to conclusions, but as a brown, Muslim male, I‚Äôd be lying if I said that didn‚Äôt cross my mind ‚Äî especially in such an opaque process. I also wonder whether things like online activity (e.g., liking critical political content) could ever be factors, even unintentionally.



Has anyone experienced something similar ‚Äî or can offer insight into what could be going on behind the scenes? I‚Äôm eager to learn and do better next time.",1,1750135948.0,cscareers,3,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

With Brandon Pfaadt (5.50 ERA) on the mound for this encounter, I can‚Äôt imagine this game seeing less than 9 runs. 4 of Pfaadt‚Äôs last 5 outings have seen no less than 13 runs, and the Blue Jays offense was piping hot up until their run-in with the Phillies. I fully expect Toronto to take advantage of this opportunity and run up a score. And, while Chris Bassitt (3.70 ERA) is a perfect 5-0 at home so far this season, the Diamondbacks have put 30 runs on the board over their last 5 games. In short: Arizona is more than capable of getting some runs past him. I‚Äôm on the Over to cash here, friends.

My boss is an idiot so I have 6+ hours in a day to start a business. I tried to fill this time with golf but it honestly gives me anxiety that I‚Äôm using free time for a hobby rather than making more money. 

I‚Äôve tried multiple side hustles. Dropshipping, Retail Amazon Arbitrage, affiliate marketing, blogging. None of them have turned into anything decent. I think having a mentor will fix this problem of starting businesses and failing. 

With the amount of free time I have, I could actually work for someone for free to learn the business and start my own. 

Curious if anyone has gone down this path. If you had to seek out working for free and then you started your own business?

I would like to hear your story. ",2,1750135166.0,Entrepreneur,2,1.0,False

Please note, I do see all the mixed and bad reviews of wholelattelove. I see some good reviews too! I am upgrading from my first machine which was a Delonghi ECP3630, and in my price range I figure its worth the gamble!

His phone lay facedown on the nightstand. He picked it up hesitantly, already dreading what he might find. Two sent messages, no reply. He read them both and groaned aloud.

Do u think about me when ur not around me?

He dropped the phone onto his chest and stared at the ceiling. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an idiot.‚Äù

There was no undoing it now. No unsending drunk words or erasing what they meant. Sasha hadn‚Äôt replied, and that was the answer, wasn‚Äôt it?

He pushed himself upright, every muscle in his body protesting, and limped to the bathroom to splash cold water on his face. He still hadn‚Äôt touched a pain pill in nearly 48 hours, and it showed. His knee throbbed in that familiar, grinding way, but he gritted his teeth through it.

He wasn‚Äôt going to go back. Not after how good it had felt to feel again.

By the time he got to the gallery, the rain had let up, but the sky was still low and gray. He ducked inside, tugging his hoodie up, and immediately busied himself in the back‚Äîunloading frames, shifting crates, doing anything that didn‚Äôt involve wandering out where she might be.

The entire place was buzzing with pre-exhibit tension. The opening was just one day away, and it was obvious everyone was running on fumes and caffeine. Even Frau Linden, the gallery director, had forgone her usual strict professionalism and was muttering curses in three languages under her breath.

Tyler kept his head down, headphones in, shoulders hunched.

He didn‚Äôt look for Sasha.

Not when he passed the front hall, where her paintings were being arranged. Not when he caught sight of her coat hanging in the back office. Not even when he heard her voice ‚Äî light and steady, talking to the lighting guy about bulb color temperature like nothing at all had happened the night before.

He shouldn‚Äôt have texted her. He knew that. She had a fianc√©. A life. A direction.

He was just the temporary, broken part.

He spent the morning in the framing room, silently trimming and smoothing prints with aching hands and stiff knees. Every few hours, the pain would whisper to him ‚Äî soft and sly ‚Äî promising relief in that little orange bottle in his backpack.

He didn‚Äôt take it.

Instead, he took a break around noon, sipping burnt gallery coffee and staring out the side door into the alleyway. The clouds were breaking. A little light was pushing through.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù Axel‚Äôs voice popped into his head from the night before. You‚Äôve got sad eyes, man. But you‚Äôre all right.

Tyler wasn‚Äôt sure if that was true. But for now, he was still standing. Still sober. Still working.

And still trying not to think about the girl he shouldn‚Äôt want.

He finished the day without saying a word to her.

But when he left, she was laughing at something someone said, her head tilted back, her hair tucked behind one ear.

He walked out before he could hear more.

Because wanting her wasn‚Äôt the problem.

1lde2xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lde2xh/19f_just_so_lost_about_the_relationship_with_my/,19F just so lost about the relationship with my 43f mother who left,"Hi everyone.
I‚Äôm 19, it‚Äôs the summer of me going into second year. When I was in grade 12, my mom told me when we were sitting in the car together one day and talking about our lives that she was in love with some client she had at work. I won‚Äôt get into the details but she told me that they didn‚Äôt do anything and that it was only feelings (in the future il find out this was a lie). Of course, I was 18, and honestly my mom and I had such a difficult relationship for our whole lives. I‚Äôve emotional raised her just as much as she did. I‚Äôve sat with her through the darkest periods of her life. I love my mom so so so much but we also argued 6 out of 7 days of the week. Not necessarily arguing but more like bickering. We would always make up afterwards. Anyways, when she told me this, my initial and entire response was to comfort her. After this day, as months went on, there would be episodes where she would cry during the day or night and I would comfort her (while my dad was at work or she would come to my room). At the time I was quite naive and just believed that she was simply in love and they didn‚Äôt do anything, but later on il find out (in the next paragraph) that they had actually been hooking up. This man was married and also had kids and they would hook up while his kids were in the car in the store she worked at (please keep in mind my mom told me all this). My mom has always been an over sharer for my whole life. I know my dad‚Äôs dick length, any facts about a man, sexual facts about my dad or her or about anything else. I think as a kid I had known so much that this forced me to mature very fast and I was very adult like up until the age of 18 where I went a little bonkers with fun and things I should of probably done at the age of 16 not 18. Either way, I wasn‚Äôt new to hearing things from my mom that I shouldn‚Äôt hear about. Part of this stems from the fact that my moms mom died when she was 16, and my mom never really knew how to behave with me after the age of 16. That‚Äôs really when a major part of the over sharing started. I‚Äôve discussed this with my mom recently and she told me she thought she wanted us to be more friend like, but I really just want a mom daughter relationship. Anyways, after she told me about the man she was in love with that she apparently only kissed and was no longer seeing and not texting anymore, she would have nights where she cried and cried and cried and told me she didn‚Äôt want to live anymore etc. she was very depressed and already on anti depressant at this time, I think she has been on them for 2 years as of the time she was crying about the man. I would comfort her and have to tell her it‚Äôs ok etc. she was so extremely depressed and just sad and just it was hard to see. Comforting my mom and her being depressed wasn‚Äôt anything new, as bad as that sounds. But this was one of the worser span of months I‚Äôve seen her like this. When I was younger and when we immigrated to the country we now live in, my mom was also depressed for some time and I remember nights where she would cry and pray to god for him to kill her while I would sit by her side and comfort her. I think I was maybe 11 or 12 at this time or so. So I‚Äôve always had to be very careful with my mom‚Äôs emotions and mental states. Anyways, during that summer (I guess this was last summer actually, I‚Äôve kind of had a hard time keeping track of the years of my life since so much confusing things happened and so much is just a blur), she slowly would tell me she‚Äôs feelings better and they aren‚Äôt talking anymore. Then suddenly they talk again, and then finally for the last time they aren‚Äôt talking anymore. Summer passes, she‚Äôs slowly getting better I guess and being more affectionate with my dad. However I jsut have a hard time watching them being affectionate while knowing she loved someone else, but in the end I was 18 and I thought I‚Äôm an adult and it‚Äôs none of my business and as long as they are happy  and sort their things out. (Please know, I was also okay with them divorcing, since my parents have had a very rocky relationship. They are very incompatible and for my whole life they would have awful arguments where my dad would slam doors and sometimes they hinged would break or the door handle would leave holes in the wall or he would smash furniture on the ground. My dad would say incredibly terrible things to my mom and would just call her awful awful names. I remember being a kid and crying in my room because I feel my so upset he was hurting my mom. He never hit her physically but he‚Äôs said a lot of very bad things to her. However they would make up, sometimes it would take days where they didn‚Äôt talk to eachother but slowly they would make up and it would go back to normal. The idea of them divorcing, I was open to and I would sometimes wish they would because I wanted my mom to be ok. I‚Äôve always had a very strong sensitivity towards my mom and very deep love and affection for her and care for her). Either way, my parents had the average parent problem, plus some not normal verbal abuse and just awful terrible arguments. Both of them were / are on anti depressants and immigration took quite a toll on them. My mom wanted to move to Canada‚Äôs because she wanted a better life for me and my dad came with her because he loved her and wanted to be with her. According to my mom, in Russia they never had arguments (well sometimes yes) but after they came to Canada their relationship just tanked. Basically she also told me that they only stayed together to raise my and cause she felt stuck with me (she told me this recently not when I was a kid thankfully). So essentially, during the end of the summer and closer to fall when my mom seemed normal and all slowly started to get fine I guess. We moved into a different apartment with my mom and dad around late September ish I believe. All was okay ish I guess, aside from the average argument and screaming and crying from my mom and dad. However sometimes at night she would still cry about the man she loved and I would have to comfort her. Every couple of weeks she would just be super depressed. I honestly don‚Äôt even remember what I would tell my mom to comfort her at this point. I think i started telling her to divorce my dad and that I suggest it would be better for her mental health and that it‚Äôs what she needs to be happy. She refused because she would tell me she felt bad for my dad and because she dragged him here to Canada and she can‚Äôt just abandon him etc etc. my parents also don‚Äôt make a lot and for the last 6 months my dad was on employment insurance because he has knee problems and very severe depression so he started staying at home but making less money, and my mom was the only one working but she also worked on and off and made a lot less than my dad even on employment insurance. Well nothing unusual for immigrant life I guess. My dad is Russian and has poor English so he can only get to an OK job. He can‚Äôt work any physical jobs because he has body and knee pains and back pains from a childhood injury. Anyways. That‚Äôs their condition, and what‚Äôs happening so far in this new apartment. Two depressed parents both making eachother more depressed. One is heartbroken and depressed, the other one is sick. 


Then I forget when, but in the fall she went on a one week vacation. The day she was supposed to come back, instead of coming straight home she had told us she was going to Costco to go buy groceries.

Fast forward a month or two to the day before my mom‚Äôs birthday, which was November 12th. When I come home from Uni, it‚Äôs really odd at home. My dad was just sitting and looking really pale on the couch staring at a wall. I was fixing my instrument and I couldn‚Äôt find the screw driver so I went to my dad and kind of got sassy and started asking where it was in a bad tone. He raised his tone at me which I mean he doesent do a lot but I was surprised since it was an odd moment to raise his tone. 


Basically then, My mom took me to my room and sat me down and told me that firstly, sue lied about the man and they had actually been hooking up, and that the day she came back from vacation she didn‚Äôt go to Costco but that the man texted her and they hooked up. (By the way she told me many times during her crying sessions she was fine w him using her sexually and all she wanted was him etc etc so she was ok w him just using her, and she told me abt problems during sex they had w my dad w him not being able to get off or get hard, and just so much more other shit I‚Äôm not interested in typing). Basically she told me she told my dad THAT SHE TOLD HIM ALL OF THIS and that she doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gonna happen next. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt care at that moment too much, actually I didn‚Äôt give a single fuck I was just fed up. They went to bed in separate rooms she slept on a mattress in my room. The next morning I was sitting in my room when i heard some quiet talking and my dad shortly packing some things and leaving. My mom then sat at the table and cried and told me she lied to my dad and only told my dad she was just in love with another man, but my dad just asked her if they had sex or not and she told him that they did (so I guess again she lied to me abt what she told my dad? Doesn‚Äôt make sense but whatever. My dad left to a hotel for 2 nights, and during those 2 days with my mom she basically cried all day and we just had discussions and talked and I don‚Äôt even remember but I remember going to uni and her calling me and telling me if I don‚Äôt come home she feels like she‚Äôs gonna kill her self. I came home and comforted her etc and just told her a bunch of stuff she needed to hear like ‚Äúu need to leave my dad he‚Äôs bad etc etc u guys aren‚Äôt good for eachother‚Äù just so she felt better in that moment. My dad and mom texted a lot during that span and argued over text. My dad told my mom she either could stay in our apartment and sort things out with him in the same room as him 5he said he won‚Äôt let my mom stay in the same room as me as he said I need my own private space and that she needs to respect my boundaries which I guess I really appreciate actually. My dad has always been a strong man with boundaries), or he told her to leave the apartment and get out (which is a bit unfair to my mom because she also pays for it). My mom chose to leave, packed her things and left to stay with a friend while looking for other places to rent.

After she left the apartment, she didn‚Äôt pack yet but my dad came home. Couple days after she came to get her things from the apartment and I helped her pack. This happened over the span of a few days where she would come to take things. She would also take some of my things and ask to take some things as she doesn‚Äôt make much and so she took lots of items but it‚Äôs ok I know she needs/needed them, but this is around the time where I started to get really emotionally un regulated around my mom. She would come to take things and I remember I‚Äôd have a ball in my throat. The issue was that I wanted them to be happy and I was ok with separation or I guess the idea of it itself, but I was not ok with the way it was executed. Separation is ok and sometimes NEEDED urgently, but do not cheat first. (By the way my mom later on made many excuses for cheating. She would tell my that EVERYONE is a cheater and one day I‚Äôd understand. My grandma on my dads side cheated, my grandpa on my dads side cheated, my grandma on my moms side cheated. Il come back to this later, but I would just get super rude and just blunt with her during these moments and be honest with her). Anyways she then moved into some basement with roommates.

My dad and I are in this new apartment we moved 3, months ago into. His paycheck doesent cover the cost of rent, my mom took the car, she doesent support is financially (this is sound December and it‚Äôs still like this). Then my mom proceeds to install tinder, hinge, etc. 

Oh god.

She would tell me about all her sexual encounters and experiences. I would tell her to stop but she would still text me about her multiple boyfriends she was fucking and that we‚Äôre all 20 years younger than her. She‚Äôs 43, and she‚Äôs had many within a span of weeks. She would only text me about these relationships, I felt so sad I just wanted her to contact me, so I after a while just listened.). Once she called me stoned out of her mind in some parking lot in Kitchener telling me some nonsense. I had to call my cousin who happens to live in the city too to call her and help her and u guide her cause I jsut couldn‚Äôt. I stayed on the phone with her for an hour or so but I gave up after. Anyways she‚Äôs had boyfriends in wheel chairs, boyfriends younger boyfriends older boyfriend this that, so many of them. So much sex she told me about. So much shit. 


I once came to visit her apartment. (She took our 2 pets by the way with her because I asked cause I didn‚Äôt have the time to take care of them due to uni). Every time I visited her I felt so hurt inside because she was so different, and also because of what she went through and how bad she felt, but also how had I felt for myself, but then how guilty i felt for feeling bad, but also how genuinely disgusted I felt with her. I would sit with her and it would just be chaos in my head. I once visited her (which happened rarely, I had a hard time seeing her despite wanting to but it was just so upsetting which is actually the point of this post but il get into this later). I tried to pet my pets but then I had the idea of how many men that visited that petted my pets and just fucked my mother and during that moment I got so upset and also just so hurt for some reason I just got up and left. She ran after me etc asking to come back and I just sobbed. This is one of the moments where I just get really upset. 

Lots of other things happened in between that but let‚Äôs fast forward to now.

My mom got a boyfriend and moved in with him. She‚Äôs 43, he‚Äôs 26. I‚Äôve visited their apartment 2 times, it went fine and I always try so hard to be happy for her. She no longer is crying about the man she was in love with. She no longer is fucking 10000 men from tinder. She has a VERY loving incredibly sweet kind amazing boyfriend. I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs him being with her, he‚Äôs very caring. But I get upset easily and but I try to not leave and keep it in. 

Today I met her and him because she needed me to meet up with her to take photos with him for his citizen ship (sounds like he‚Äôs using her for the green card, but trust me he‚Äôs not. She‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs helping him organize it all, she‚Äôs helping him stay in Canada, he‚Äôs not using her at all, I‚Äôve thought about this and investigated. He‚Äôs also a little too clueless and a very simple man and is not using her in that sense for the citizenship, they aren‚Äôt even marrying she never wants to again, she‚Äôs just helping him). 
Anyways, I had to wait for 1 hour with them cause they were taking so long at the bank she would time to time come up to me to talk to me to tell me after this we can go grab coffee or food or something or walk me home. I wanted to hangout and see her and spend time. Not so much with him, but if she loves him, then I want to spend some time with him too. I have mixed emotions looking at him but he‚Äôs a sweet man. I knwk I jsut feel this was because I‚Äôm just hurt inside, which I don‚Äôt know if I should or shouldn‚Äôt be but I‚Äôm just tired of my own thoughts, so I just am lost.. My patience was already running out. Then we took the pic and we almost walked up to the cafe. She started to turn to me to ask me all excited what I want in the cafe and that she will buy me something (my whole life I always have guilt wirh my mom spending money on me. We weren‚Äôt ever really broke broke but never financially off, always barely scraped by for money after paying for rent. At this moment today, I mentioned that earlier when she left my dad and I she took the car, she bought it for 11k 2 years ago with my dad and they spent a total of 9k on repairs cause it kept breaking. By the way after my mom left she immediately went 10k dollars in debt from rent and other stuff and etc. anyways she‚Äôs been trying to sell the car for a fee months but it stood for so long that it broke again and she needs to spend 3k to fix it again. 

Anyways. We were walking to the cafe, and she asked what she can buy me. I said nothing I‚Äôm not hungry (I don‚Äôt want her to spend money on me.). She said Nono I‚Äôm getting u something what do u want. 
In that moment,and still all evening I get this ball in my throat and I just get so upset. And I realized in a few seconds I will just break into fucking hysterical tears. So I told her I need to leave (again me and my stupid leaving and crying and making her upset. I‚Äôm so scared to feel like an emotional burden to her. I do say some mean things or harsh things sometimes recently because sometimes he‚Äôs out of pocket but I also don‚Äôt want to hurt her. All of this spins in my head in that moment that I‚Äôm a financial burden and etc and that I feel bad for her but also feel bad for myself which makes me feel even more dumb and greedy and then how I don‚Äôt want to be there with him but also want to get to know him better but also want to see her but I just can‚Äôt be there). So I give her a kiss on the cheek and leave. I walk home crying, and I am crying writing this. 

I genuinely don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm feeling. I feel like all the shit I‚Äôve bottled up is coming now for the last weeks but it‚Äôs killing me

It‚Äôs like I feel sorry for her, sorry for my dad, sorry for myself (which makes me feel shit because I‚Äôm actually doing perfectly fine I shouldn‚Äôt be sorry for myself). 

All the bad things passed, my mom is fine. My dad is okay ish. Not the best off financially, probably  the worst we have been in so far but it‚Äôs still fine. Food in the fridge, I just found a new job.

Every time I see my mom though, it‚Äôs like I feel so much and just I can‚Äôt tell if I hate myself or the situation or if I‚Äôm angry at my mom or what. I‚Äôm slowly hating myself more and more just I want to see her, but when I do I get upset, and then I leave and then I‚Äôm home and I feel so awful like I‚Äôm a bad daugjrwr and that she doenset deserve that treatment, and she‚Äôs told me before when I declined meeting with her bf to take the pics that she doesent deserve that kind of treatment etc. then I‚Äôm confused by own feeling.

Anyways I feel so much of this just spinning my head all the time when I see her. And so much confusion. For so many years I was able to just zone out from her and my parents and distance myself emotionally and I felt so adult and mature.

And now I‚Äôm 19 and I should just not even be so concerned with her and our relationship and we are as far away emotionally and roles wise from each-other yet i feel so insanely sensitive and just attached but detached. She‚Äôs so different and I‚Äôm so different now and I just wish I could just be 14 again and be myself again and for my mom to be herself again‚Ä¶. I feel like a whiney emotional baby. My friends who‚Äôs parent would pass away when they were younger and they miss them, they are gone, yet my mom is here and alive and doing better and so much better than she has in these last 6 years together (as in for the last month or two since this new bf and new basement she lives in), yet I am just grieving and feeling so so much. I always dissect and analyze my emotions and try to find ways to minimize harmful feelings or situations or anxiety but I just can‚Äôt dissect this at all. I just want to be normal with my mom and just feel fine but I‚Äôm just a mess. I apologized to her today I didn‚Äôt want to make her feel sad because I‚Äôm sad but I‚Äôm just so confused and I didn‚Äôt want to party poop the cafe hangout and make a scene or be a cry baby there so my only option was leaving. 

I ranted so much and just I didn‚Äôt organize some of this properly I‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt have a therapist either but I also have such a hard time with therapists and I don‚Äôt want to share my feelings with them. I just needed to type this out.

Just wanted to say thanks for all the comments. I didn‚Äôt expect this to get much attention but wow, apparently we‚Äôve all got a ‚ÄúLisa‚Äù in our lives.

So‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs the mini soap opera that unfolded:

The day after the whole charger incident, Lisa came in acting super cold. Like, ""barely-a-nod-in-the-break-room"" cold. I let it go because I honestly didn‚Äôt feel like dying on the hill of ‚Äúwhy are you being weird about my phone cable.‚Äù

Anyway, later that afternoon she made a very loud point of saying to no one in particular, ‚ÄúSome people just *can‚Äôt share*, I guess,‚Äù while pulling out one of those ancient brick backup chargers that charges your phone from 7% to 8% in an hour. I just sipped my coffee and pretended to be deep in an email to ""Corporate"" (aka scrolling memes).

But here's the best part: My manager actually pulled *her* aside, not me...and gently reminded her that personal items should be respected and that she should stop treating people‚Äôs desks like a rental shelf. I didn‚Äôt snitch, I swear. I think someone else must‚Äôve overheard her salty commentary and reported it.

Also, fun twist: Turns out Lisa *borrowed* another girl‚Äôs stapler a while back and it ‚Äúmysteriously‚Äù ended up in her drawer. So‚Ä¶ looks like I‚Äôm not the only one with a Lisa Loan Crisis.

Moral of the story? Protect your chargers, your staplers, and your sanity. 

Anyway, thanks for backing me up. Feels good to know I wasn‚Äôt being petty, just setting a boundary that should‚Äôve been obvious.

I'm a coffee enthusiast with delonghi dedica home espresso machine. 
I order pre ground coffee from Blue tokai and other roasters, since I don't have a espresso grinder yet. 

In my recent order, BT accidently delivered whole beans instead of pre ground.
I was curious if a fellow coffee enthusiast in the city has grinder and would be willing to help me out.

I met her during my internship and instantly fell for her. We got different locations after that. 

The there was this woman(in her late 30s, single) who lived two floors below me. I would occasionally see her. Never interacted with her until one day when I was coming down the stairs and she was lifting her suitcases inside the flat. I asked her if she needed help and she nodded. I helped her with the suitcases and was on my way like a metro. 

In the evening of the same day I heard a knock on my door and there she is with a bowl with palak paneer in it( typical I know). I accepted it and asked her for a cup of coffee. She declined stating that she has some friends over and left. 

My wicked mind saw this as an excuse to try to seduce her. The worst thing that could happen was she would say no. Anyways my GF wasn't there(I regret doing all this). 

I started bringing her food the following week trying to build a conversation, asking about her life and all. The third time I knocked on her door she said to me with a straight face - it's not gonna happen. I said I wasn't hoping for it. We gave each other a smile and she invited me inside. I had beers in my bag that I was taking to my flat. She asked me if I wanted coffee, I said let's have beer instead. We both had two pints each and were feeling it. She caressed my hairs and face saying that I remind her of her first love. I took the opportunity and said - I can make you feel like your first love. Grabbed each other kissing like our primal instincts had kicked in. And then the deed happened. 

This kept happening twice or thrice a week until I left the city after 7-8 months to be in live in with my GF. Tbh, it was something to be with an older woman. 

My GF and I broke up for different reasons but she never got to know about this and I regret cheating on her. ",1,1750133969.0,OffMyChestIndia,0,1.0,False
