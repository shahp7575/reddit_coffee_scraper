Check these out!,"Hi, Relatable Reese fans! Here's our second installment of other YouTube channels we think you'll enjoy. We know you love to hear about Reese's experiences in a cult, her shopping finds, her sex stories and her girl talk about makeup. These channels will give you a lot of the content you're craving and they won't sadfish or make you worry for Reese's 14-year-old son.   
  
Also, please come visit us on the SPTV Unvarnished subreddit to read very popular recaps of Reese's streams and have discussions about them with other fans and even some of Reese's former mods and closest friends! This is a welcoming place to ask questions.

Melanie Murphy: This sex-positive channel features big sister vibes, deep chats and videos on the benefits of feminine orgasm, tips on masturbation, losing your desire and body positivity. Melanie identifies as bisexual and she aims to break down stigmas around sexuality. She does a series of chatty Get Ready With Me videos and also has very popular videos about clearing up acne. Here’s a link to her video on what counts as cheating. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chQ2KaHoYbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chQ2KaHoYbI)

Hannah Alonzo. She does a mixture of ""top fails"" videos poking fun at MLM content. MLMs can be very culty and Hannah has an engaging personality, so her channel is a good fit for Reese’s fans. Reese loves buying and selling clothes and accessories on Poshmark and Hannah has whole playlists about Poshmark. A bonus is that her cats show up in her videos sometimes. Here's a link to one of her MLM horror stories where she reads out people's personal experiences with MLMs. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQGev5YqlBw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQGev5YqlBw)

Rachel Oates. Like Reese, Rachel strongly believes there’s no right way or wrong way to live your life. She does long-form social commentary videos, so if you want some interesting, long content about women’s issues while you’re multitasking, Rachel’s channel might be just what you’re looking for to replace Reese’s channel. Here’s a link to a video she did titled Ashley Madison, Cheating and Faking a Baby. It’s about a family vlogger’s infuriating book.

Here's a link to one of her videos on thriting Goodwill after dark. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMEkwskbvIU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMEkwskbvIU)

B. Jones Style. “Always play dress up” is the heartbeat of her channel. You can get inspired to create magic in the everyday. Her channel features thrift shopping, vintage tours, hair tutorials and travel vlogs. She’ll also take you behind the scenes working as a fashion stylist. Here's a link to one of her videos on styling fall outfits. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnkUrcmsn4I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnkUrcmsn4I)

Like it says in the title, I’m hoping to find people to talk to during the day. It can get quiet and lonesome, and I love getting to know new and interesting people!

By no means do you have to be Jewish, I just put that in there since I live in an area with few other Jews, so it’s nice to connect with other members of the tribe. Happy to talk to people who are curious about it too, but I am by no means an expert. 

I’m a nerd in general , so feel free to talk nerdy to me, but my interests are broad and I can get into anything anyone else is passionate about. Science, philosophy, creative writing, gaming, working out, photography, cooking, F1 - these are all on the table to name just a few. 

I’m the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person. 

I am a fan of playful banter, shameless flirting and being an all around degenerate, but that’s not the main goal of this post. I am open to seeing where things go, but let’s take it slow, okay?

Interested in making friends with anyone, and open to more depending on how we vibe. Tell me how you like your coffee (or tea), or the last meal you made that you were proud of! Feel free to use chats or messages. Hope to hear from some of you soon!",1,1730383596.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

It’s been 7 weeks since my husband passed. 

I know it’s different for everyone but I would like to hear how some of you guys cope with the death of your spouse/partner?

I don’t want to see anyone other than family. I have no desire to respond to texts from friends. One friend has consistently been checking on me. She offered to take me out for a meal/coffee this weekend. Why am I having so much anxiety about it? I’m thinking about canceling and hiding at home.

I went back to work last week. Again, lots of anxiety being around people. Unfortunately, I don’t have the chance to not see people. But every opportunity I get, I’ll hide in the locker room. I don’t even put my head up anymore to try and avoid eye contacts with people. At lunch, I just avoid all of my coworkers and sit in a corner to eat.
 
I just want to be alone. I don’t have the desire to want to socialize or talk to people. I feel a lot of guilt at the thought being happy without him. How do you guys move forward with life? Im confused and lost. I miss my husband so much. I’m very much in denial still. It’s like a part of me knows he’s not coming back but like my heart won’t accept it. I often think how is he gone? Why is he gone?

TLDR: how did you guys cope? Any tips? How do you guys feel now that you’re a few or even more years out? When do you start seeing hope again? 

On an unrelated note, do you guys get a lot of chills/goosebumps when you are grieving? I get so many random ones throughout the day even when I’m not cold.

I feel both fatigued and restless at the same time. I can tell I’m pretty exhausted, but at the same time, I have been able to function decently without coffee or with very minimal coffee.

1ggf95l,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ggf95l/looking_for_a_good_grinder_4k/,Looking for a good grinder (4K),"Hey people,

I recently returned my mazzer Philos because of issues regarding consistency, and clogging. And now I’m looking for a worthy replacement.

Im in the mood of spending anywhere between 0 and 4k on a good grinder. So about everything is on the table.  
  
In my household we like the more traditional, chocolaty/sweet coffee more, However im also looking for a tad more clarity separation of flavors so fruits can be tasted too, wihtout getting sour. My Philos(189D) or Zespresso K Ultra, both cannot/couldnt pull out the fruity flavors.  


80% are milk based espresso, 5% espresso, 15% pour over(for which the ultra K could be enough).  
  
So far I have watched reviews of multiple grinders, and I put the prices including taxes and or shipping next to them. which changes the lineup.  
  
DF83V espresso +ssp sweetlab (1250)  
P64, SP HU + SPP Sweetlab (2300)  
P100, (3300)  
01, (3300)  
EG-1 CORE (3550)  
Monolith Flat MAX (4500 ish)  
  
the P64, Eg-1 and Lagom 01 seem to me the real choices.  
Lagom 01 is new, and it’s a expensive grinder, so not to many have the grinder. And my experience with the new Philos, was not great. So im hesitant to buy anything that’s new and unproven. Also return shipment for Lagom is international shipping, which is expensive and with risks. While weber has an EU location. Saving me taxes, Repair/RMA is easier/cheaper.  
  
P64 is a very good choice too, still international shipping, having all the 64mm burr options, is a good thing, but im not sure if at this price point 64mm is still ""the best"".   
  
I do have the disposable income, to get the more expensive options, even though it might not do much for the taste/experience, but be done with the feeling of needing to upgrade. (pay once cry once).  
  
Personal notes:  
I like the design and workflow of the EG-1 more. The EG-1 Core burrs seem to be a good fit. there are other burr options that fit the EG-1. im not sure there are many 98/102mm burr options for the lagom 01. P64 speaks for itself of course.  
  
If I had to pick now, I would pick the eg-1,  more beatifull, tested and proven good, easier rma if needed, and other burr options available being the biggest arguments.  
  
im very curious how you think about this.",0,1730383321.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

I'm in my mid 40s, and was recently diagnosed with HFrEF. My blood pressure has always been on the lower side so at the moment I'm only on low doses of bisoprolol (2.5mg), rampiril (1.25mg), and apixaban (5mg), all twice a day. 

My BP is hanging just above 90/60 on those dosages so there is currently no scope to increase things there. 

I got a virus in March that seems to be the cause. Initially my body just seemed to compensate around the problems until AF joined in about 6 weeks ago and I began this journey. 

I used to run a lot, with a generally healthy lifestyle, and all the tests reflect this.

My lvef is 20-25% (consultant told me 25 but paperwork says 20), and my rhr has slowly come down to 60 ish (though after almost passing out due to low BP yesterday evening it is currently in the 80s).

I've cut out coffee, alcohol, and pretty much all chocolate, etc. I cook from scratch, and am working from home so can do probably literally anything that might help.

Thank you in advance to the Captain Obvious-es out there. I hate how I was sobbing just a few minutes ago bc I'm just tired and overwhelmed right now, then my son texted me and it was funny as hell...so I was laughing my ass off. I felt nothing otherwise, just a brief moment of hilarity...

After I'd finished texting with him, I put my head back down on the table...and it was tears all over.

I hate how the phone pulls me out of my head for a short time, and it's like the emotions (real) shut off and I just feel the emotion I'm ""supposed"" to feel in that moment. It's hard to explain. Whenever I'm done with whatever it was I was doing on the phone, I'm right back up into my head ... Depression just overtakes me again.

I'm not clever enough (nor do I have the energy) to figure out how to stop this from happening bc I can't be on my phone the whole day...as much fun as thst seems to be, im sure i would get tired of it quickly anyhow. I'm too tired mentally and physically to do anything, work on any mental health stuff, nothing. I literally am a vegetable today...and I feel so guilty about that.

I was crying bc I was thinking of how healthy I was just a few years ago. I was robust, heavier than I am now so I had a good body weight (albeit a slightly overweight one) ... I had energy, vitality...I was depressed and a drunk, but I had some happiness in things I was doing. I could at least get around easily. My kids knew the healthy me. I am starting to have this all sinking in just a little bit now. I am sick. I have a disease. I don't want my kids to see me like this, all pale as milk, exhausted and sickly looking all the time, so I put more and more fancy and normal masks on...and each one gets tighter and tighter to wear until I feel like I'm trapped and I can't move or scream...

Sorry for that word salad. 

They see the act I put on. Everyone does, except maybe at my Group Therapy Program. The masks come off there--just a couple of them, though...they (the people at my Group) see more of the pain than anyone besides my bird (my cockatiel Coffee) and my many stuffies. My bird sees it at night when I cry myself to sleep. My stuffies see the panic attacks and anxiety and then medicating and being ok again.

I dunno where I am going with this or what I want. I'm done whining. Back to work for me...putting on that mask again (how ironic that I actually DO have to wear a mask in real life?) and making as if I am fine and dandy. Here I go. Wish me luck!😭",1,1730382507.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

It sat in its box till I got the Aiden, and I actually didn't set this stuff up till early October. I've been using Nespresso for convenience the past couple years, but the cost of the pods and the quality had me wanting more.

Anyways, the first time I used the Opus... fine. Ever since then, nothing wants to come easily out of it. I bought brushes to clean the grinder, I hit the exit area after every use. The area where the grounds come out just pack in there. After reading some posts on here, I'm beating the thing like a bongo drum trying to help them out. It doesn't really change much. The grinder area also gets packed full. Today I just tried running it to see if maybe I could get it to force some grounds out - it just packed full and got so jammed up that it beeped and I had to clean it again.

The only coffee I've tried running through it is the Miel De Flores, which came with the Aiden. I started at 7 on the dial, but I've even cranked it all the way up to see if not grinding as much will help. I've pretty much wasted the majority of the bag + I have coffee grounds going everywhere from trying to constantly clean this thing to get the coffee to come out.

In my mind, I thought this would be as simple as wake up, grind some beans, put it in the Aiden, enjoy a single cup, get on with my day but instead its just be struggling with this grinder to get enough grounds to make one cup.

1ggerep,https://www.reddit.com/r/badbreath/comments/1ggerep/bad_breath_on_others_do_i_confuse_theres_with_my/,"Bad breath on others, do I confuse there’s with my own?","
First, I want to define bad breath as a real stinking breath type, not just something that happens after eating fish or forgetting to brush my teeth.

About me:
I’ve been dealing with this topic for a long time and had two halimeter tests years ago, both of which were negative. Close friends I’ve frequently asked have also confirmed that they didn’t notice any odor. Over the years, I’ve asked various people, and all responses were negative. However, an ex-girlfriend mentioned many years ago that I sometimes had bad breath. Strangely, I thought the same about her, and a friend also commented on her breath once. There have been other situations over the last 20-30 years where I felt someone was trying to alert me to my bad breath, but those instances were rare. Still, I am quite paranoid about it and tend to keep my distance when speaking, etc.

Regarding my oral hygiene, I think it’s pretty good—at least not so poor that there should be a strong odor.

However, I do suffer from reflux a bit, but I am mostly symptom-free and only experience heartburn very rarely. My diet is quite healthy: no sugar, no alcohol, but I do drink coffee.

My main question:
I’ve noticed that there are times when I suddenly detect very strong bad breath from people nearby. When I observe these individuals, I don’t get the impression that others can smell it too. This surprises me because it is so strong in my perception and info smell it when these people are talking or breathing next to me. I wondered, as paranoid as I am, if I might be picking up on my own breath in their presence and mistakenly attributing it to them. Like my brain would trick me. Yes, that may sound like another paranoid idea and rather constructed.

However, about a month ago, I was at a hairdresser and noticed strong bad breath from the hairdresser. Recently, I went back to the same salon but was served by someone else, and again, I briefly detected the same odor, but this time from the “new” person. This made me very skeptical, as I find it statistically unlikely for two different people in the same place to have the same bad breath.

At that time the Mazzer Mini was a great choice for a home grinder. Things have changed a lot since then obviously and in addition to the antiquated work flow those 58mm burrs seem to be completely sub-par both by Mazzer's standards and now compared to pretty much any other flat burrs.

He's upgraded machines a few times and is now rocking a Profitec 700 but has kept the same grinder. He's in love with coffee but isn't on this sub where I've learned so much, like the importance of the grinder; he doesn't even do the basics like weighing his grounds😱. (Even more shocking if you know the timer knob and crappy doser on this grinder).

He'd doing probably a half dozen drinks a day, mostly milk drinks, and likes classic Italian (dark roasts). I've heard the Allground Sense has not so great retention and that people really love the Atoms. But would like to hear what you think as he's going to pull the trigger as soon as I give him a recommendation. I told him it would be in the $1500 range.

October 2024","I am posting this as I relied heavily on reddit for information for this trip and wanted to give back. Feel free to ask questions. 

Also, I don't think all the information out there is current, so I wanted to add updates, which I'm including at the start.

1. All camps I visited took card payments. Only the shuttle bus was cash only. (5,000 CLP per person) I would still have cash but we did not need it apart from the bus.

2. You can book the boat from Pudeto to Paine Grande online and in advance. We understood cash only.

3. Wifi is available at every camp we stayed, and we did not pay for it. 

We hiked as a couple west to east over 5 days in early October. We spent 2 nights in refugios (Grey & Paine Grande. 2 nights in tents (Frances & Central).

We booked the camping part of the trip with Torreshike (dot) com and the rest ourselves. This is not an ad for any group. You can definitely book the trip on your own but we are travelling and had a few balls in the air. This just made it a little easier for me. It added $167US to the cost. 

Best camp - Paine Grande.
Best food - Frances. 

The whole trip cost us $2400.22. This includes return flights from Santiago, taxis, coffees at camp, rental equipment, and ATM withdrawal fees. Basically, everything. 

I am not including flights to Chile, though, as we were already there. We booked in August 2024 for October 2024. 

We booked half board and brought lunch food with us.

**Pre- booking**

Apart from actually climbing to TdP, researching the trip was the hardest part. It took a long time and I found it quite complicated but every was perfect once we booked. 

Would just advise people to research and read trip reports and to consult websites. 

One thing I think is worth noting is that we booked the trek first and then flights. Just to make sure we could definitely do the trek.

We gave ourselves a day on either side of the trek itself, too, which helps slow everything down.

**Book in advance**

We booked the following in advance.

1. Park tickets 
2. Bus to TdP with Bus Sur 
3. Rental equipment 
4. Accommodation on the trek

Some people booked when they got to Puerto Natales with their hostel. However it was kind if messy. They had to leave the park for portions due to lack of accomodaiton and carry tents for other sections.

**Equipment**
We needed to rent equipment. We rented from Puma House in Puerto Natales. Equipment was good, and they were, by far, the most affordable. 

We needed sleeping bags, crampons, rain pants, and poles. They don't have everything, and there are loads of places offering rental equipment when you get here. 

**Day 0**

Fly to PN fron Santiago. Flight arrives before 9 am, and people could possibly get straight on the road to the park

We used day 1 to collect rented equipment and buy food and snacks in a shop. We also had some bag and shoe repairs we were able to get sorted last minute there, which is great. 

**Day 1**

We got the 06.45 bus to the park. We went to Pudeto. If you are going past the park entrance, you just stay on the bus, and they check everything is in order. It was simple

Bus/boat schedules are designed to coincide, and we arrived at Pudeto at 09.45 for the 10.30 boat departure to Paine Grande. 

The boat arrived at around 11.10 and we then walked to camp Grey. 

This was 11 km and easy enough going. Slow and steady for us anyway. 

We found the estimated timings offered at the camps to be basically accurate for us, but the on trek information regarding distance to and from other camps we felt was hit and miss. 

**Day 2**

Hike to the glacier grey lookout. There are several along a route, and the furthest is 4KM past camp grey. We went to the first one, which was 10 minutes away, and were happy enough with that. 

Then, we hiked back to Paine Grande. You leave your packs in camp grey for the glacier part.

**Day 3**

Paine Grande to Italiano (7.6KM, with pack)

Italiano - Mirador Britanica (5.5 km each way, no pack)

Italiano - Frances (3KM, with pack)

This day was long more than anything but absolutely worth it. 

Overnight Frances 

**Day 4**

Frances to Central (16KM, with Pack). Tough day for us.

**Day 5**

Central - TdP (20KM, with day pack)

It was very challenging for us and the only day we experienced rain. 4.5 hours up and 4 down. It seemed to be the hardest part for everyone including those who went the other way good or bad weather. 

We stayed at the campsite and the kitchen gave us a packed lunch in place of the breakfast which was great as we left Central at 02.50 am to be there for sunrise. Word to the wise, this in not enough time. You should be on the road at 02.30 at the latest to get there for sunrise.


**What would I change?**

1. Stay at Chileno. We hiked for 2 hours and met people who were just leaving that camp for sunrise when we got there. Not doing this is my biggest regret. However, an upside was we didn't have to carry our packs from Chileno to Central and we got to shower at Central afterwards so that was good. 

2. Book directly ourselves and have a small bag to carry stuff for sections where you can leave the backpack behind. 

3. buy more snacks. Ours were insufficient, but the bagged lunches we saw were not worth it, IMO

4. Carry less and rent a smaller sleeping bag.

**Was it worth it?**

In the all the countries I have visited the W Trek is one of the best things I have done. It is 100% worth it.

The trek was surprisingly quiet and we found ourselves walking alone for hours at a time.

1ggehr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ggehr9/tips_and_regrets_first_time_8_day_trip_with/,"Tips and Regrets: First time 8 day trip with family of 4 with two boys, 14 and 11.  ","We recently returned from an 8 day (7 on ground) trip to Japan over our kids' fall break with our 2 boys, ages 14 and 11. We were in Tokyo for 2 days, Osaka for 3, and back to Tokyo for the last 2 days. We flew direct from the midwest to Haneda in economy. Thought I'd share a few lessons learned:

1) With 4, a taxi from HND to our Shinjuku hotel (the JR Blossom - very nice property) was well worth the minor premium over 4 adult tickets on the limo bus and the easy button after a lengthy, tiring flight. We'd just missed the every-half hour departure to Busta Shinjuku, so would have stood around waiting anyway. Each of us had a small backpack and carry-on. All fit inside the common hatchback 'JPN Taxi' replacing the long-serving Crown sedans.

2) At the Blossom, we opted for the breakfast buffet for our first 2 days. Also well worth it IMO for a family. The kids had easy access to delicious western and japanese food, we could eat our fill, and bottomless coffee helped us quickly get on Tokyo time. It was one less thing to think about in the sensory overload that is Tokyo.

3) We bought iPhone Suicas for 3, and got a child Welcome Suica physical card at HND for the 11 year old to get the half-price fares. The family traveling with us thought they'd buy tickets at each station. This quickly fell apart when they were buying 24 total tickets to go to and from a few places in Tokyo. My 11 year old lost the welcome Suica on the last day; adding a Suica to his phone fixed the issue. NOTE: Sometimes apple cash works to add value, sometimes it doesn't. We got trapped at a fare gate and I had to add a credit card to the Apple Wallet on my 14 year old's phone when he was 10 yen short and Apple Cash decided not to work (that reminds me, I need to delete it).

We used leftover yen on the IC card to get vending machine snacks at the airport. 

4) Smart-Ex is worth the learning curve to buy Shinkansen tickets and take advantage of 3-day advance discount on Green Car seats if you know your itinerary. Changes are easy as well. I got a credit card working before we left to avoid any issues (a Barclaycard Mastercard with no foreign transaction fees- this did require a call to the issuer to confirm the charge wasn't fraudulent). We did not add Shinkansen tickets to the IC cards, which probably was a mistake. If you print your QR codes to board like I did, KEEP YOUR PRINTED QR CODE to exit if you go that route. We didn't fully appreciate that the QR code - not the seat assignment printed by the ticket gate (which shows your fare and exit station) - was how to exit riding from Tokyo to Osaka. Fortunately, a helpful station attendant pulled up the QR codes on the Smart-Ex app and we exited. When returning to Tokyo from Osaka, I got physical tickets from a Smart-Ex capable machine. Next time, I'll add the tickets to the IC cards and not screw with it, though you have to download the Suica app for an iPhone to get your IC card number. Apple wallet does not display it.

Traveling in the Green Car makes every other form of long distance mass transit seem like a hayride.

5) Kyoto is really crowded. We split a guide with the other family traveling with us and started at 730am, which was worth it for our situation.

6) Ship your luggage. It's cheap, easy, and there's no reason to further annoy residents dealing with a massive tourism boom by lugging giant suitcases on crowded subway cars. Also, if you don't ship it and have larger luggage, remember to book the appropriate storage on Shinkansen trains.

7) Common courtesy, like giving your seat to an older person who just boarded, resulted in my teen receiving some smiles and kind words (none of which we understood) from a few people on the train to Kyoto. We talked on the flight over with the kids about cultural expectations, particularly in deferring to older people. A few other obvious tourists (fortunately, they didn't appear to be Americans) forgot this, and did things like cut in line at taxi ranks, loudly talked on phones in subway cars, were oblivious to the priority seating areas, etc. Don't wear shorts, either.  

8) Stay flexible and don't stress about making restaurant reservations. I'm a very detailed planner and love new restaurants. No one else in my family shares that. That means I only had broad-brush things to do and where to eat, and only made reservations at 1 place. When the kids and their friends with the other family had a great time at Round1 Stadium on the first night in Osaka, we went back a second time and the adults had a great dinner at an izakaya around the corner despite me stressing about all the other things we could have been doing or seeing. It turned out to be a wonderful, memorable evening. The kids ended up eating teriyaki burgers at McDonalds they still won't stop talking about.

We also waited too long to get Shibuya Sky tickets, and ended up at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Center observation deck. It was incredible and free, and another spur of the moment thing we thought of walking around after breakfast.

9) There's way too much to see in 7 days; 10 days; 14 days; etc. It took me a bit of time to make peace with the fact I had no hope of making it a 10th of the way down the list of stuff I wanted to do, but unless you spend 90 years living there, you won't see it all.

10) MIMARU Apartment hotels were great for a family. We stayed in one in Osaka, then cancelled two rooms at the Karaksa Ginza to switch to one room at the MIMARU. Clean with friendly staff, they're a great choice for 2+ people and the small kitchenette and dining table gave us plenty of space.

They have on-site laundry, however, I used a 24-hour laundromat around the corner from the MIMARU because they had larger, faster, cheaper machines.

11) My son and I are huge car people, and a friend of a friend got me in touch with someone to take us to Daikoku PA on Sunday AM, the customary cars and coffee meeting point for an array of supercars (yes, I know this is controversial, but it was the furthest thing from an LA-style sideshow possible). It was a longtime dream to see it, the cars were fantastic, and everyone was really friendly. DM me if you want more info.

12) The one regret: I wish we were able to see Hiroshima and the peace park. I think this would have been possible if we took the Shinkansen from Osaka to Hiroshima early in the morning, spent the day there, and took a domestic flight back to Tokyo in the evening. Hiroshima's airport is about an hour outside of town by car or 90 minutes by airport bus, as well. It would have been a long day, but I think I'd trade a day in Tokyo to experience it.",0,1730381218.0,JapanTravelTips,7,0.5,False

Okay, I’ll try to keep this as straightforward as possible, but I’m already sweating just typing this. Here goes:

We’ll call her Sarah. Sarah and I met during freshman orientation in college. We were in the same group, both kinda introverted, and ended up being the only two who actually stayed in touch after that week. We went from grabbing coffee together to full-on study sessions, late-night fast food runs, and staying up all night talking about life. We were there for each other through every breakup, every stupid exam, every stressful family holiday. It was always platonic… or at least, it was supposed to be.

Somewhere along the line, I started to feel things. At first, I just ignored it. I dated other people, she dated other people, and we both seemed totally okay with that. But the feelings never went away; if anything, they got stronger.

Last weekend, she called me over because her boyfriend broke up with her out of the blue. I got there, and she was in tears. We spent hours talking it out, and at one point, she fell asleep with her head on my shoulder. I spent the entire time just staring at her, wondering if she could ever feel the same way.

Now, I'm at a crossroads. Part of me thinks I should just tell her because it’s eating me alive. But the other part of me is terrified. What if she doesn’t feel the same way? What if it ruins everything? I don’t think I could handle losing her as a friend. ",1,1730381046.0,relationships,3,1.0,False
1ggef3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1ggef3c/just_need_to_get_it_off_my_chest/,Just need to get it off my chest,"So I matched with someone (24M) on Bumble about a month ago. I (25F) had been out of the dating scene for about 3 years with the exception of a fling last year with a old long term friend. 
We instantly hit it off. Had great conversation... a 10 hour phone call staying up all night. Several other calls never less than 2 hours. Our first date was great and so fun. We both had never done the activity before and we just joked and celebrated getting the hang of it then walked around for hours. It ended up being a 7 hour first date. Over the past couple weeks we have hung out at my place several times because he works day shift and has been in class for a certification and I work overnights so our schedules haven't lined up the best for a real date activity type thing. 

This man validates me, listens to my feelings, let's me be silly and weird. This is probably the first really healthy relationship I've had and it's brought up a lot of weird roller coaster feelings. I absolutely adore him and how this is going but it's been hard to battle my own mind when we just.... communicate and not fight. Yet at the same time it's absolutely glorious. 

Added bonus he's super handsome and has great goals and plans in life and makes me laugh all the darn time. We have shared hobbies and things we want to do on our own. We can be in silence together as much as we can be goofy or talk about anything serious even if it's awkward. I love that I feel safe around him. I've genuinely been sleeping better too.

When he stays over I've made dinner once (he usually comes over late and has already eaten or drank a protein shake and doesn't want food) and I'll make breakfast and coffee in the morning before he leaves for work and it brings me such joy to do that for him.

Really I just needed to gush about this man without being super sappy to him too early or annoying my friends by not shutting up about him. If you read this far thanks, I don't really need any advice just well wishes for things to continue going well for us. ",7,1730381018.0,dating,8,1.0,False

1ggeeib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ggeeib/my_first_ever_paranormal_experience/,My first ever paranormal experience.,"So I attended the last halloween tour at a place called the Ulster American Folk Park in Northern Ireland, there was a new story told of a recently recovered chest full of documents, stories, last will and testiments etc, of this man, Crudden Boyle, a man who worshipped Bilé, the Irish god of death. 

I do want to mention that this was a halloween tour, I am a skeptic so I'm not convinced that it's ghosts, just that the experiences I had definitely didn't seem part of the experience, since no attention was brought to them.

The folk park has some buildings that they painstakingly moved brick by brick from their original location, including a building called the Campbell house, which is considered to be the most haunted building in the park. The folk park discovered that Boyle had lived in this house for about 5 years, engaging in blood rituals and incantations. 

When we were lead into this house we found a multi-pack of beer and some coffee cups, from some teens looking for a cheap thrill, which apparently links into the house having an increased rate of break-ins after Crudden left. So, this security guard claims his Grandmother was a Boyle, so potentially related to Crudden. Just before the guard entered the building I heard a singular knock upstairs, and as he spoke and mentioned the rituals and magics that Crudden was involved in, I heard 3 distinct thuds throughout.

I was also standing infront of a small indoor window, I kept looking at it (it was behind me), I constantly felt like there was something watching, like if I kept checking I might see a face, but I could have been psyching myself out.

The final thing that confused me is that no matter how many times I heard his name, I struggled to remember it until I heard it again, that continued until after I left, but this being the day after, I remember his name just fine.

Like I said I'm a skeptic, so I'm not convinced that it was paranormal, we never went upstairs on the tour so there could well have been someone upstairs, but it didn't seem like there was, still, definitely really interesting.

TLDR: I heard some bumps and knocks on a halloween tour that didn't seem part of the tour. ",3,1730380971.0,Paranormal,2,1.0,False

I have been working out 4x a week for the last 8 months, and although I have definitely gotten stronger, I noticed my weight hasn't gone down, but rather has gone up. I look in the mirror and still have a gut. I usually drink a Premier Protein 30g shake prior to working out. My workouts are intense and consist of:

1) Monday -- Chest (bench press, incline, chest flys) ; Triceps (tricep pushdown) ; Shoulders (shoulder press)   
2) Tuesday -- Back (back rows, lat pulldown) ; Biceps (Curls)  
3) Wednesday (usually a rest day)   
4) Thursday -- Legs (squats, leg curls) ; Shoulders (lateral raise)  
5) Friday -- Same routine as Monday of chest, triceps, and shoulders  
6) And then I usually workout either Saturday or Sunday

After working out, I immediately blend up a protein shake with a handful of blueberries and a banana, along with Creatine and some oatmeal, and protein powder. 

I usually drink coffee afterwards. Around lunch time, I order a chicken bowl from Chipotle. I don't put any Queso or cheese in it, but mainly black and brown beans; lettuce; red onions; chicken; and other veggies. I usually consume this with Celcius. 

After that, I consume more coffee and have a protein bar shortly afterwards.

Then, for dinner I order a subway footlong sandwhich with veggies and chicken (no cheese) on whole wheat bread. I WFH so I order for convenience. I don't consume any candy, soda, fried foods, etc. Also, I don't do much cardio (besides occasional walks with my dog).

Do you see any areas here where I may be making mistakes? My goal is to get my weight down to 175 lbs while also retaining muscular strength that I may have built. Thanks! ",1,1730380965.0,loseit,1,0.67,False

Beware Election/Guy Fawkes Hype! - GME 10/31 Open Interest Price Movement Forecast and Options Analysis,"Welcome back to another edition of **Open Interest** \- the only GME price movement forecast dedicated to an analysis of the options market!

[Remember, remember the 5th of November... but, wait, why would it affect the Stonk?](https://preview.redd.it/glb542o5d3yd1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b5564cada12d6b1b56e8d8b545698f57e2a8cea)

Okay everyone, today's write-up - even though obviously still bullish - is a bit cautionary. I've seen a lot of hype surrounding our upward volatility resuming or picking up next week because of election day or Guy Fawkes' day... but what do these events have to do with the history of GME and Keith's GME requel. My thoughts? I'm not seeing much. They could, after all, but it'd be a surprise to me. So let's take a look at our usual data and see what it might be able to tell us about how traders and institutions might be setting up for November in light of our recent price action. Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

[10\/30 Trading Day 1-min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/j8562hanv2yd1.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=aba08cb8f91fe30bafed024476417880ac7a6eab)

Yesterday was a big day, obviously, as the market responded to the news of Keith's 13G/a filing. After an AH pump to $24, the price was walked down to $23 in premarket trading, elevated for a quick drop back to $23 at open and then pumped to $24.45 on huge bullish options volume first to $24 and then up to $24.54 for our highest price since before Q2 earnings report.

The remainder of the trading day saw the price double test support at $23 before trading up to the middle of our lower VWAP channel, using the 200-min SMA as a resistance signal while it diverged from the 50-min SMA, then trading around it into a close above $23. 

Ultimately, options premium sentiment evened out throughout the second half of the day, especially on some very large short call orders:

https://preview.redd.it/wdbf0hwqx2yd1.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79fd2be4a0ceee094e7ded17b82a5474070736e

These types of large trades key us into how bigger institutional traders are playing this action over the next couple weeks, namely that ***they are selling our IV spike*** now that the returns for doing so are so tantalizing. I'll have more to say about this as we take a look at our OI shifts and GEX data.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

So Max Pain has FINALLY moved up this week to $21 for Friday's expiry. However, this has come as a result of a huge amount of profit taking at the call strikes to the lower end of our former trading range.

[11\/1 OI Changes 10\/30-31](https://preview.redd.it/mxzom7yfz2yd1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed75719001a73cdf088aa5da0f6b1d4f7485d7ae)

Closing those ITM calls at just the $20 and $21 strikes relieves MMs of a combined 1.1 million share obligations which are now either delivered, sold for cash, or rolled to future expiries. While this does not forecast price collapse, this does - and did - tremendously influence our momentum yesterday.

[11\/8 OI Changes 10\/30-31](https://preview.redd.it/qw5y1rbq03yd1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a5d6ab80c9383f7c69864119980cff317f83bd8)

At the same time, we see there wasn't too much profit-taking for 11/8 which projects some continued stable conditions and elevated price action into next week. We also can see the popular short call strikes of $25 and $30 filling out with OI as IV sales become appealing to traders, exempli gratia a $30 11/8 call at close yesterday (around $50) was priced the same as a $25 11/15 OPEX call was at EOD last Wednesday. That's a HUGELY different risk profile for a $50 return for short contract.

11/15 also saw a sizable OI retraction specifically at $20:

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 10\/30-31](https://preview.redd.it/8pvwanvg23yd1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=886754a692082b0b0af82f96a9465422609395d4)

This activity looks to have been a mix of profit-taking and loss-cutting on the early spike off the open. However, the numbers don't exactly line up as the total volume on the day is lower than OI decrease by over 1,000 contracts. Its possible this OI was rolled and did not go down as 'trade volume.'

https://preview.redd.it/mjpwtjtn23yd1.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad79abd3afac6c6c624c716175ac0f61efa71121

Based on this type of price action, I think our run this week was entirely orchestrated by institutional and organic options activity anticipating the 10/29 CATalyst. Maybe there was some kind of T+35 dynamic at play as well. In any case, whatever has played out this week has been entirely structured for capture by the derivatives market. 

**Gamma Exposure**

Our intraday gamma hedge structure does not look too different, again, from some of the structures we've seen recently and it is still, largely, volatility-suppressive at current levels, barring outsized options volume:

https://preview.redd.it/wr3kc6bfo2yd1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d400f53dc3cce3174535509ac062dc283b5e6009

I'll point out some key changes in this structure, however. Firstly, all the profit-taking on ITM calls yesterday has softened our environment below $22. It is still stable and doesn't pose any immediate risks for downside volatility, but it has freed up a lot of share hedges on the part of MM. $25 and $23 are still our largest positive net gamma positions heading into today's trading with $25 as strong distal overhead and $23 as a turning point in our price range. $22-$24 will look to form up as our November trading range with $25 as a distal overhead. 

This structure projects some continuity into November OPEX:

[11\/08 Gamma Exposure by Strike](https://preview.redd.it/3qncag3sp2yd1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db0235ac41c37a7fb712cae152ce67c3a415990)

[11\/15 Gamma Exposure by Strike](https://preview.redd.it/sig0y3zwp2yd1.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=d817c09feb7ef25ed2a044236d1285b007a37d61)

For 11/15, the half-dollar strikes still need to fill in, but for now the heavy composite positive gamma positions at  $21, $21.50, and $22. Heading into 11/8 weekly expiry, I therefore expect the price to consolidate atop this support, allowing some potential for bullish reversal to retrace up to $23 and, with enough bullish sentiment in the options market, to take us into the $23-$24 semi-bracket again, before moving back down toward the end of November as we prepare for our earnings IV thump.

**Technicals**

[7\/16-10\/29 1-Day Aggregation w\/ Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/5xkdlzxlt2yd1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=63ec353ad7dc58f5e0db172a3b90bceca92be6a9)

[7\/16-10\/30 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/b4w3b6oi93yd1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5aa1dee38e1f61b1eaf5221878aafdb86531260)

Our current 1-Day aggregation chart is showing bullish divergence off of and out of our 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Average channel (finally) and has transformed our shape from the bottom of the Nikkei crash on Aug 5 up to now into an upward trend. Our 'rejection' of the $24.50-$25 area suggests technically that we flatten out and retrace to the downside over the next few trading weeks the price seeks to test the 50-day SMA as a support marker for our new, just-forming uptrend. The presence of large amounts of call gamma at $21, $21.50, and $22 suggests that, indeed, this support will be found.

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/tmwiideqb3yd1.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4eeb1ea6515b3acb0929f1911a8e32225bdd1a7

Our near-term IV appreciation for the meanwhile has likely peaked. Barring an external information event that causes the stock to pump again, I expect sideways trading to allow for some IV depreciation into the end of November, though the collapse will not be quick, nor do I expect it to reach the same levels we encountered just prior to the Cat Day run. Beginning around Thanksgiving (dependent upon when earnings is officially supposed to happen) IV will tick back up for about two weeks.

**Kitty Corner**

I also wanted to take some time to discuss what Keith might be doing over the next few months and how that might affect what happens with our price action. 

In the first place, I think Keith's principal objective is market reform and exposing Wall Street corruption, not becoming as rich as possible. However, he has learned how to anticipate corrupt Wall Street market manipulation to his advantage. So long as the game goes unreformed, he will become extremely rich. His millions already transformed into hundreds of millions, then as we saw this Spring into a billion. What happens when a single retail trader transforms a billion into 10 billion? 100 Billion? How many funds will be bankrupt as a result?

As I've stated elsewhere, I think Keith is setting up a trap for Wall Street manipulators: reform the market or make me and GameStop worth untold billions at your own expense. Keith has done a great job building a paper trail that exposes Wall Street and MSM collusion and manipulation tactics via his livestream and his moves with Dogstock. I think the real Kansas City Shuffle is (was) that all of this coverage of Keith's trades meant to 'expose' or 'stop' him from profiting is actually what Keith wants them to do in order to demonstrate the extent of their corruption and rigged control of the markets.

These are only the first steps, however, and I suspect something else is coming down the horn. I think Keith will attempt to trigger another DTCC settlement crisis over the next few months, but perhaps not with the attempt of pumping GME back to untold MOASS heights. RC and Co. will continue to do what they do. The real, non-orchestrated price movements are likely to come down the pipe via real news on the company.

Nonetheless, I think Keith will make some sort of move this Fall - maybe in conjunction with the Q3 earnings report in December as part of his 'requel.' The January 2021 Catalyst was a settlement crisis stimulated by Cohen's December 13D filing, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/2skbuzf283yd1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=66861b653816f256c40b0d558fe18ad636072d8b

And here's Keith's reaction to it:

https://preview.redd.it/b2g5agc683yd1.png?width=402&format=png&auto=webp&s=2132c09d8edb6e461be53105b8dbd3b3809abbc8

I think Keith's move, thus, will take the form of a 'requel' of RC's moves, as many others have speculated. Maybe some of the buying pressure will come from Keith itself. Maybe RC will declare his intent to purchase more shares. Maybe new long whales will step up. It is difficult to speculate with much usefulness here, but the short of it is this:

Keith reliably followed through on the 10/29 CATalyst. He demonstrated consistency and followed through with it. It is not his intent to fake out or manipulate the GME investor base and the Cat Day 13G filing was evidence of this. This also means that our entire November trading landscape has been meaningfully restructured to the bullish side as a result of his 13G, be that something of his doing or institutional orchestration and organic options demand (probably the latter). 

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Heading into 11/1, I am expecting the price to move into the $22-$23 bracket and close toward the lower end of this range. IV appreciation has been too tantalizing for traders not to sell it into our near term options expiries. We are looking at 200% and 300% price appreciations on weeklies for early November versus last week now even despite our price returning to Earth a bit yesterday with a week less theta on the contracts. I expect the price to find stability at $22 and wiggle around the $22-$23 area, maybe $24 in the weeks to come, but ultimately stay away from threatening the $25 short call positions inside of November. 

Obviously, an externality can emerge and change the options market's behavior toward these price levels, but in Keith's own words:

""You're not gonna break 16, 17, 18 without news, for starters. And the news itself has to be really tremendous. So far, GameStop has been really meting it out over time.""

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",69,1730380508.0,Superstonk,12,0.96,False

I was not a supportive girlfriend and was very reactive when things didnt go my way, didnt communicate my needs well (was passive agressive most of the times), couldnt compromise, I was very critical towards him, had an anxious attachment style etc. It was my first serious relationship.
After the break up I learnt that our relationship was actually codependent (he was the giver, and not knowingly I was a taker). But also I learnt that I have a lot of unresolved childhood trauma due to childhood emotional neglect.

During our relationship I started going to therapy, but it was talk therapy and I always felt invalidated afterwards and my reactive behaviours never really changed, so my ex broke it off with me.

Since the break up I learnt a lot about trauma, attachment styles, I started going to a somatic therapist once a week, joined a group somatic therapy, went to a 2-day workshop on non-violent communication. 
I also changed my job, focused more on developing better relationships with my friends and family, etc. 

I feel like I understand where my behaviours are comming from and I am learning how to cope when I am triggered plus I am planning to continue with therapy to learn more and process my traumas. I feel that I have changed a lot for the better and feel like I even matured in the process. I realized that I really want to have kids and family in the next few years. I also realized that I want to work as a somatic therapist in the future and I am starting a 3-year self development program as the first step towards that goal.

I am very proud of myself actually and how I am handling life and I see that my mindset has shifted. I also know it is not like I am a completely different person and I will still struggle with certain things even when I go into a new relationship (which I am not ready for now), but I know I am working really hard on myself. 

When things ended with my ex he said he will also work on himself (after we had a talk about his codependency and enmeshment with his family - he wasnt aware of that before) and that maybe in a few years we can give it another shot if it is meant to be. We have been in NC for about a month and a half now. I feel like I am getting over him and moving on, however, I still would like him to know the ""new"" me. I was thinking of reaching out maybe around Christmas time (it will be 3 months of NC) to see how he was, ask him if he wants to grab coffee and just to see if he is also working on himself. 
I know as a dumpee I shouldnt reach out, but I feel like there might be a chance for us still if we both evolved and worked on oursleves or at least I can give up all hope if he doesnt respond or doesnt want to reconnect. I cant shake this feeling that if I knew what I know now while we were together, it would never ended between us, so I want to get that last no from him I guess in order to fully let this story die. I also wouldnt be interested in being with him unless I saw a significat change in him or at least some self awareness and desire to change, which was not there while we were together. 
Also, if it doesnt go well, at least I have really worked on myself for me and for the next person I am going to date and I am very proud of myself for that.

Is it a bad idea to want to reach out after 3 months of NC to see where things are with him? 
Please let me know your toughts.

sometimes it makes me feel energized and sometimes it makes me really sleepy , i like the effect better when i have coffee it feels like its doing more than if i just don’t drink it ,without it i don’t feel much, my brain is quiet but i cant stop moving my leg and if im still im picking at my scalp , and i lost my appetite and forget to eat during the day.

Hey Reddit!

I recently moved back to Sharjah and noticed there isn’t a solid expat group here like the “Meetup Abu Dhabi Expat's Group” I used to join. That group was a fantastic mix of people organizing meetups for all sorts of things—coffee, shopping, long drives, or just hanging out. It had different communities for different interests and did a great job of keeping everyone connected (shoutout to the admins!).

Inspired by that, I’ve created a similar group here in Sharjah, open to working expats for now (just to keep things manageable). As we grow, we’ll get more admins on board and structure things further.

For now, it’s me, a German, and my Persian friend running the show, and we’d love for more of you to join us. Whether you're into social hangouts, networking, or exploring new places, there will be something for everyone!

A friend tells me to grab a cup of coffee and I need to be there at an exact time and, if they're late, I'm mad. 10 minutes late and I'm thinking of ending the friendship but that's not me - I'm just mad and thinking stuff that will help me deal with it better. The thing is I don't really care that much about losing some time or not knowing what I'm going to do later.

Yesterday I asked a friend if he was doing something that night. He says he doesn't have plans , so we can see if we'll schedule something. He replies four hours later saying that it's still a maybe, he's not sure. In my head I was just like ""okay, you don't have plans so why don't you make some? What's constraining you?"" and I told him we'll schedule it for another day. I did this out of spite and in this case I was upset because he was my friend and should be a little clear. In hindsight, I think I did him wrong and should have talked with him instead of cancelling.

But it's constantly happening at work: I arrive to an office for a meeting and the person who's supposed to greet me doesn't pick up the phone immediately, I get anxious, but there's no compulsion afterwards other than cancelling.

I really think that people should be more assertive and specific while scheduling, and it's a problem that happens almost daily at work, but this bothers me just a bit more than that.

Does anyone have some insight onto this?

How normal is bone loss after a root canal treatment on a front tooth (11) at the age of 16.
It's been three years and other than occasional spiky feeling it didn't really hurt, the tooth is just a bit more loose but that's to be expected I think. It wasn't done by an endodontist but a pediatric dentist and I thank her for not taking many hours on a child I was.
Nowadays after an acquired gut, thyroid and autoimmune issues, mineral deficiencies plus loss of period for two years I went for an all round checkup and since the old dentist retired I went to a new office where they offered fancy 3d scans and they found bone loss, an endodontist refilled the root canal but said that as long as it doesn't progress it should be alright and there was no need to disinfect/inject calcium etc. 
Took 2 hours, when I asked about why did I need my root canal refilled he said to schedule an appointment in a few months time and we were tight on schedule and he hasn’t replied to my texts (6 weeks already, receptionist said he's busy and to gargle with salt for meantime if I have issues) I understand but am still confused and lost, as well as very anxious as I grew up in a house where parents didn't really bring us to doctors so not well versed in that.

Hey Reddit!

I recently moved back to Sharjah and noticed there isn’t a solid expat group here like the “Meetup Abu Dhabi Expat's Group” I used to join. That group was a fantastic mix of people organizing meetups for all sorts of things—coffee, shopping, long drives, or just hanging out. It had different communities for different interests and did a great job of keeping everyone connected (shoutout to the admins!).

Inspired by that, I’ve created a similar group here in Sharjah, open to working expats for now (just to keep things manageable). As we grow, we’ll get more admins on board and structure things further.

For now, it’s me, a German, and my Persian friend running the show, and we’d love for more of you to join us. Whether you're into social hangouts, networking, or exploring new places, there will be something for everyone!

1ggdzck,https://www.reddit.com/r/ezraklein/comments/1ggdzck/reaction_to_whats_wrong_with_trump/,Reaction to What's Wrong with Trump.,"**TLDR: The issue isn't Trump. The issue is addiction. Trump is just one brand of products being made to juice the states of agitation and rage.**

This episode took me some time to digest. Ezra does an excellent job of illustrating how Trump’s strengths and weaknesses stem from his disinhibition. I also listened closely to his follow-up discussion with Maggie Haberman. However, I think both Ezra and Maggie missed something beyond Trump—it’s about America itself.

I grew up in a family plagued by addiction. Of my mother’s four marriages, three were to alcohol addicts. I’ve wrestled with this issue in my own life. Anyone familiar with addiction knows it often draws you to others who share the same struggles. As a young adult, I partnered with an addict, and we built a life together over 17 years. He was a good man in many ways, but his addiction still governed him, just as it had his father.

I know addiction when I see it. And, to be blunt, America is addicted to Trump. It’s not just MAGA, not just ANTIFA, not just the media—it’s the whole country.

This is why analyzing Trump’s psychology or motives feels, to me, like a futile exercise. It’s like sending an alcoholic to a vineyard for a wine tasting. Sure, they might admire the wine’s provenance, vintage, notes, color, and finish. But at the end of the day, they just want the drink.

My mother, god bless her, is a Boomer. Thankfully, she’s been a lifelong liberal—and also, an addict. Before 1998, when we first got the internet, her addictions were limited to nicotine, caffeine, and sugar. But after that “You’ve got mail!” buzz, her life was bifurcated. Pre-’98, she had hobbies, was active, and loved socializing. After, we mostly saw the back of her head. She had plugged in and acquired a new addiction: her virtual life online.

Just last night, I visited her. We sat together in the living room, and she had Stephen Colbert streaming on her laptop. The focus of every joke in his monologue? Trump. I’m sure she went to sleep later, bathed in the cold blue shine of information overload, as MSNBC continued talking about only one thing: Trump.

Our home, like that of the addict, has become cluttered with the evidence of our addiction. Either you're for, or against the man. He's left thousands of empty little dusty baggies all over our coffee table and we find ourselves utterly incapable of understanding how anyone could NOT have an opinion about him.

Maybe you doubt me. But I am certain you know an addict. If the relationship between you and the addict in your life is healthy enough, and you believe you can tolerate it, ask them to talk about their favored substance. Ask them to tell you about it. Are there different kinds? Is there a specific way to use that maximizes the return? I guarantee you that, as long as this person is not in recovery, they will gladly and with high spirits go into deep, granular detail about the one thing in their life that brings them more love than any other union could.

To understand addiction, you have to see it as a reasoned, logical response rooted in our natural and essential need to experience certain specific emotional and physical states. No one uses with intent to become an addict, and media portrayals of addiction are often flawed. They focus on “end-stage” addiction—the eviction notices, broken families, violence, and homelessness. 

Fewer representations exist of functional addiction. This is probably because there is no “problem” there. So what if they go a little overboard in the evening? They still get to work. They are still fully operational, productive, and providing every necessary utility to society and earnings calls. It’s a rat race. Who wouldn’t need a drink?

I believe America is still in the early stages of this addiction. And, if you frame Trump as a drug, you can see that the behavior of the culture mirrors that of drug use closely. During the Obama years Trump was still being manufactured and market tested. By 2016, he was fully synthesized and ready for distribution. The public could not get enough of it. But, like any other drug, most people were able to partake in a recreational way. They weren’t born with the blend of neural architecture and socialization that made them prone to abuse. And now, in 2024, we see voices in the media say things like “He just doesn’t have the juice anymore.” We see that many of the small town that were draped in Trump merch in 2020 are quite a bit less bedecked by signage and flags. 

The buzz is wearing off. The blue meth is gone and now we’re freebasing some black tar scratched out of a forgotten pipe found on the floor below months of unwashed clothing. See, this is how you know the addiction is there. Because you'll go to further and further lengths to maintain it, succumb to it, embrace it, and it will leave you conflicted, full of self-loathing, and seeking solace in your use to hide from your shame.

So while I will be celebrant beyond measure if Kamala pulls off a decisive win and, after the onslaught of bogus shenanigans that we all know are coming, Trump fades from public life. Hell, were I to get the news that the man finally ate that Heavenly Hamburger, I think I might actually weep with joy. 

But I am also worried for the aftermath. Because recovering from addiction is a messy, fitful process that always entails a few slips back into those old habits. The vodka may be gone. but there might still be beer in the fridge. 

Likewise, Trump will eventually end. But, addiction is a powerful motivator. No addiction has ever stopped just because the “good shit” wasn’t around anymore. Reinvention is not an easy thing to pull off. It’s doubly hard when that reinvention is your own identity, peer group, and leaders.",53,1730379781.0,ezraklein,15,0.88,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1ggdxk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ggdxk7/help_im_trapped_inside_a_spider_web/,Help! I’m TRAPPED inside a Spider Web.,"This is gonna be the Best Halloween Ever! Grandma went out to buy extra candy – it’s a quick jaunt, and I’m okay being left alone – she’ll be back in fifteen minutes. Twenty, tops.
 
Now’s my chance! I grab a chair and put it directly underneath the entrance to the attic. I stand on my tip-toes, but can’t reach, so I grab a broom and pry it open; then I jump, grab hold, and lift myself into the attic, which is way more difficult than expected. But I did it! I'm terribly excited. And nervous. What's up here? No one speaks of Grandma's attic. Ever.
 
Sudden darkness surprises me. I reach for my phone, and curse my stupidity. My phone is on the coffee table. I’d go back and get it, but there isn’t enough time. Plus, the chair tipped over, so getting down means jumping, which will hurt. Meh, I’ll worry about that when the time comes. First things first, time to explore.

The heat up here is tremendous, the air thick and stale; the floorboards creak as I creep around, looking for a light switch.  Something squeaks, startling me, and I fall face-first into a giant cobweb. 

“Ah, crap!” I shout, which is dumb. I just swallowed a mouthful of web. Gagging and coughing, I wipe the icky stuff from my mouth.
 
As my eyes adjust, I get anxious. The entire attic is filled with cobwebs, and not the normal kind, these are huge and elaborate. Veiny like my grandma’s hands. I try moving, but the web holds its grip, sticking to me like superglue. Again, I reach for my non-existent phone and curse my stupidity.

“No worries,” I tell myself, near-panic, “Grandma should be home soon.”
 
I wait for what seems an eternity. She really should be home by now. Without my phone, I have no idea how much time has passed. It feels like hours, but probably mere minutes. Growing more and more impatient, I give it everything I’ve got, trying desperately to free myself, but I get further entangled. 

“This is nuts.” 

My mind turns against me. Maybe the spiderweb is alive. Maybe it’s lonely, trapped inside this attic all these years, and I’m its prisoner. It’s probably hungry. I look up and groan. Dangling above me is the scariest spider I’ve ever seen, big as a tarantula, huge and hairy and hideous. Its beady black eyes stare into mine, daring me to move, its orange-black tentacles teasing me as it scuttles about. 
 
I hate spiders. Always have. When I was six or seven, my older sister hid one in my sandwich, and I ate it. Everyone teased and called me Spider Boy. Now this? If my bratty sister finds out, she’ll tell everyone, and I’ll be the laughing stock at school.
 
Again I try freeing myself, thrashing and flailing my skinny arms, but nothing works. By now, my entire body is entwined. This makes zero sense; I may be small, but still. I try again, only this time slowly and meticulously. I’ll wiggle my way free. That outta work. 

It doesn’t.
 
When is Grandma getting home? Surely, it’s been a half hour by now, but I can’t tell for sure. Not having my phone sucks. What did I do to deserve this? I mean, trapped in a spider web? Who heard of such a thing?
        	
Something heavy lands on my head: The giant spider. 

“AAAHH!” 

Frantic, I swat it away.

“OUCH!” 

It bit my hand. I can only hope it isn’t venomous. Without my phone, I can’t check. As I flounder about, the thing flies off and lands next to me. We have a stare-off; one I’m destined to lose. 
 
The heat is getting to me, my armpits are soaked. I wipe my forehead, which is a mistake. I’m covered in thick, ropy web. “This sucks,” I complain. “There must be a way to free myself.”
 
Straight ahead is a large trunk covered in cobwebs, beside it, a busted ironing board; boxes and boxes of books line the slanted walls. On a small table in the corner is a bunch of fancy tea cups with blue patterns on them; like everything else, they’re coated in cobwebs. 

Strange noises. 

“On no. Please no.”
 
Spiders. 

Crawling out of every crevasse, tap, tap, tapping their tiny toes – or whatever it is they walk on – as they go. Yuck. I hate spiders. Have I said that already? Cuz it’s really, really true. Adrenaline arrives like cavalry, giving me super powers. 
 
“It’s now or never.” 
 
Fists clenched, screaming like an idiot, I charge, freeing myself, and end up smashing into the table with the tea cups; cups explode, my skinny body slips and falls, and everything goes dark. 

I must’ve passed out. My head hurts. My body feels like a dumb truck. Before I can open my eyes, I feel something crawling across my face. 

""Oh God, no.""

My eyes snap open.
 
“AAAHH!” 
 
A cluster of creepy spiders are crawling across me. And I’m snagged. The web is holding me hostage. Stupid spiderweb. I’m freaking out. The spiders are gonna eat me!  This is ridiculous. Where the hell is Grandma?
 
A thought arrives: Maybe she’s home! 
 
“Help!” I shout, hoping she’ll hear me. “I’m trapped inside a spiderweb!” 
 
Nothing.
 
The shrillness of my voice shocks me. So do the spiders. Like soldiers, they're preparing for battle. Tap, tap tap, they march across the dusty attic floor, attacking me. Hundreds of them, maybe more, creeping along my pant legs, crawling inside my T-shirt. I feel them in my hair. And I’m stuck! Can't move. I’m more terrified than I’ve even been in my life. I really don’t wanna touch one. I might get bit again.
 
Panicking, I look around, desperate to free myself. ""Aha!"" The broken tea cups! I stretch out my hand. Not the one with the bite, my other. It isn’t as strong, but beggars can’t be choosers.
 
My little fingers inch closer, stretching as far as humanly possible. Almost there. Soooo close. Meanwhile, the biggest spider in the world is scurrying up my arm, trying to stop me. It’s surprisingly heavy. And ugly. With tremendous effort, I snatch a shard. It’s sharp, and I don’t wanna cut myself. Using the sharp end, I slice and carve and cut the rope-like web. There’s so much of it! It's taking longer than it should. 
 
SNAP. The final thread give way. 

""I did it!"" I leap to my feet, careful not to snag myself again, then I go on a squashing spree. Phew! Killing spiders is a daunting task. Growing weary, I tiptoe towards the exit. I look down and frown; the chair is gone. I forgot.

The house shakes. The front door slams. 

“Toby? You home?”
 
“Dad?”
 
Is it really him?
 
“Up here!” I cry. 
 
My father’s worried-sick face greets me. Looking up, he says, “What did you get yourself into now?”
 
He helps me down and cleans me off, then tells me how he’s been texting for nearly an hour. Turns out, Grandma was in a car accident. She’s fine, only minor scrapes and bruises, but her car is totaled. All I can do is jabber on and on. I’m still frantic. My hand is sore, but that's the least of my worries. My father is holding something. A bag. When I see what's inside, I go into shock. 
 
""Oh, no. Please, no."" 
 
Is this some kind of sick joke? Must be. If so, I don’t like it. Not one bit. He hands me my costume, but I refuse to take it. No. Freakin’. Way.
 
“I knew you’d like it,” he says, ruffling my hair, which is still coated in cobwebs. 
 
“I’m staying inside tonight,” I pout.
 
“What? Why?” The shock on his face is as real as my swollen right hand.

Then it hits me. This is no joke. 
 
“No way I’m wearing that costume!” 
 
My father frowns, the worry on his face worsening. A ping of guilt rips through my heart, but I’m adamant. Nothing will change my mind. Period. 

“Why?” he asks, eyes pleading.

I choke up. I hate seeing him looking so sad. I gulp.

Either way, I'm very excited to sink my teeth (and hopefully not too much of my wallet) into this project. I'm told it's an 11/73 CPU, and I can see it has an MFM controller and a streaming reel tape drive, so I would imagine SCSI? 

This is my first voyage into the world of mini computing, and I'm really stepping out of my comfort zone here into uncharted waters for me. When I get it fired up it will be my first experience out of DOS, BASIC or CP/M. I'm a little nervous about learning the language, but I'm told it's not too different than CP/M.

I have always been a fat Kid. Got into smoking and alcohol during my undergrad which resulted in my body totally going out of my hands. Ended up being 145 Kgs. And one day I just saw myself in the mirror and I felt disgusted by what I saw. As if I saw something I hadn't seen before. I asked myself ""What the fuck am I doing to my life?"" ""U aren't even trying. U won't live long like this."" And the very next day was my first day at the gym. The first few months were hell. Just getting up and going T the gym felt like an exercise. But that was the real part. I made it a point to go the gym no matter what, even if the gym closes at 10 and I was late, I went at 9.30 but I didn't miss. My attendance for the first year was 361/365. 1 focused more on lifting weights and LISS cardio, and I can't thank myself enough for it. My diet consisted of high protein foods like eggs, paneer, chicken. I completely cut off sugar and didn't have anything sweet for the first 2.5 years of my journey. Removed every processed food from the kitchen. Anything that came packed wasn't allowed. Then Corona hit us all. Although I really couldn't workout much, but I made a promise to myself that I won't let myself ruin my efforts during lockdown. Ate only simple home cooked food like Dal, rice, sabzi and chapati. No fancy foods or dalgona coffees. Fast forward an year, I was addicted to the gym, tho still not fit by any standards. I was still 97 Kgs. Took some time for me to reach 89-90. Second lockdown hit us. This time I lost 10 kgs during the lockdown because I had shifted my diet to millets, green vegetables and fruits. Again no processed food or anything sweet. After the second lockdown, I had reached a stage where I knew I had become too slim and I didn't want to lose more weight but focus more on building muscle. Started bulking and reached 86-87 and got strong whilst maintaining bf around 15-16%. January 2022, hired an online coach to see how it helps. Took a 6 month plan. Cut myself down to 77. Never checked the BF%. Assuming it should be somewhere around 11-12%. Followed a strict diet with fixed macros. Proper workout routine. And cardio empty stomach in the morning. June 2022, MBA started and I wanted to bulk up whilst staying lean. January 2023 I was 85 kg with good muscle definition and strength. Since then I haven't followed a diet plan because once other things takeover it's hard to follow a strict diet. Only focus was to hit the gym daily, no matter what, be it exams, interviews. I didn't miss. I made time for it. I woke up at 5 even if I slept at 2. Just focused on getting protein rich foods through whole sources. Maintaining myself between 84-87 since then. Just want to tell everyone that if someone like me can do this, u can definitely do it as well and better! So anyone thinking to do it, just do it now that u can before it's too late.

1ggdrrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1ggdrrs/you_can_too/,You Can Too,"Today, Halloween 2024 is my 1 yr sobriety anniversary. 

I spent a good 15 years drinking and at least 10 of those I would actually consider alcoholism. Over those 10 years it was nightly drinking of at least 1 pt. of straight liquor. 

I tried to quit several times and I know it sounds cliche but I never REALLY wanted to. And so I fell into the shame cycle most of us struggle with. I wanted to share some highlights of the things I've learned as both and alcoholic and someone who is currently living sober. 

- The most important advice I can offer is: Its very important to be kind to yourself. You will try to quit and you will likely fail MANY times. It's a process and the fact that you have the strength to keep trying despite yourself shouldn't be taken for granted. 

- A common thought over the first few months of sobriety (other than ""The Nag"" to drink) is humoursly surprising: Do people actually shit and sleep this good? Trust me, you're missing out. I had forgotten what a nice solid bowel movement and actual sleep feel like. 

- nothing, NOTHING, is going to make you feel like you do when you've been drinking. SO my advice to you is this: find the thing that irritates you the least/you enjoy the most and invest time in that. Don't expect it to be a solve-all either. You will find how much time you've wasted getting drunk and trust me: there's SO much time. It's gonna be hard to fill at first and YOU WILL get frustrated. Just keep at it. It gets easier around week 3. It doesn't matter what you do or even if actually you want to do it - just do something. Anything! 

- You will be isolated. In one way or another your relationships will change. Some for better, some for worse. Just let it happen, you can circle back on these relationships with a clearer headed when you've had time to understand yourself. That said...

- You have to be absolutely honest with yourself. Along this self discovery you may uncover some not so flattering truths. Let me remind you of bullet point one. Go easy on yourself!

- THIS IS A TRANSITION. In order for this to work you need to be open to all things during this time. Maybe you'll find religion, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll try reading and decide you really hate books. You may take up exercise, enjoy it, but ultimately fall off of a regiment. Don't worry too much about any of these things. You're a new born - you're trying to figure it out. It's OK if you don't find ""a thing"" right away. 



Well, that's it. I'm sure there's more but it's early and I haven't had my coffee. 

I believe in you friend. If I can do it, you can too.

DM me if you want.

1ggdquf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ggdquf/am_i_the_broken/,Am I the Broken?,"I’ll try to keep this short and to the point. My wife and I are both in our 30’s and have been together for 10 years. We have generally great marriage and not many problems. I love her tremendously and up until a few months ago we really didn’t ever have any major issues, at least nothing going on for more than a week.



The beginning of this year we found out her ADHD was a bit worse than I thought and she got medication for it, which has helped a lot with her clarity. She also has facial blindness and doesn’t generally see / comprehend others faces and features. It’s hard for her to pick someone out of a crowd because of this. We also found out she’s very closely identified next to Demi-sexuality, which neither of us knew about until recently when my Wife became very upset I made a comment about having to look away from a women who kept bending over right in front of us (2-3 times in a short period of time). 

This opened a whole new world to her. She had no idea I could be aroused, or attracted to anyone but her. She literally said, “Isn’t that saying true, that once you get married you ONLY have eyes for your spouse??”. I understand that is her reality - quite literally. But I’m not any of those things, my mind is focused, I’m very aware of my surroundings, my memory for names, numbers, and people is very good. 



She took all of these things and proceeded to question everything about me, sexually, mentally, fantasies… 

I grew up very religious and it took YEARS for me to get out of the mindset that Sex isn’t taboo. That I can ask for it, talk about it, be okay with it. She was the one to get me through that. She introduced me to things I hadn’t tried, seen, or knew about. I was feeling confident in who I was. She brought me to Sex stores, found sexy videos/shows/movies to watch with me, and brought me out of my shell. 



**I have \*\*NEVER ONCE\*\* crossed a boundary and cheated, emotionally or physically on her.** I’ve always kept to myself out of fear of her well being. 

* I let her tell me to delete social media because of “other women might be an issue”
* I deleted Facebook because she didn’t like that I would stand up for our beliefs and it might make her look bad (she hates confrontation). 
* She went into my accounts without me knowing and deleted people off of there who she felt “shared pictures of their body too often” (Artists, musicians, etc. Not some playboy channel)
* I’ve always kept my tongue with her around the sensitivity of her insecurities, not bringing up anyone else because it makes her feel like she’s “not enough”
* She questioned me when there was a women in a bikini top nearby as we were getting coffee (at a beach), she felt insecure because she felt I may find her pretty or be aroused by her presence
* Our friends nanny was wearing very skimpy clothing at an event we went to, and I was NOT paying any attention to her, but one simple pickup of the toddlers dropped item right infant of our table was enough to make her ask, “Well, isn’t she going to be in your fantasies later?”
* I was questioned about why I could remember women’s names, like maybe they meant something to me and I spent “too much time thinking about them” (As I said, I remember people, faces, male and female… It’s easy for me)



After these realizations on her part. She started going off of me and said, “Porn, Nudity, your arousal are the reason I have so much insecurity, and it’s been that way for the past yearly 10 years”.   
   I’m not some porn addict, we watched together and I never ignored her.  **We have a good sex life and marriage, anywhere from 5-10 times a week. It’s not I’m ignoring her needs, desires, or wants.**

 

After spending months trying to work through this with her, here’s really what It comes down to:

1. Any fantasy not involving her, even in my own mind, is wrong. It’s hurtful to her
2. Anyone/Anything that is an arousal that is not her body (even a fully clothed woman), is degrading and I'm not staying respectful of our marriage 
3. Anyone attractive, perceived or not, I should actively seek to get away from. Her example was an attractive women at a gym, I should get up and leave my station so I won’t be tempted by arousing thoughts. 
4. Masturbation -  if it involves anything I find arousing (could be a full clothed image of a nun), is breaking her security and making her vulnerable.



She said to me without my 100% focus on her body alone, I will cause her to become numb, I will not allow her to thrive in our marriage, she will do her duty as a wife, but have an indefinitely achy heart. Any sexual attention or pleasure outside of our marriage just makes her feel thrown aside, and rejected. 



I wish I could just rewrite my own thoughts, fantasies, control my mind all of the time, never see anything arousing (especially not do something that could seek it out!). This seems like an impossible chore and I want to do good by her, but I also don't want to be a mental mess and resent her.

Tried magnesium and L theanine. Got on buspar. Nothing really helped. I was Vitamin D deficient and have got that up to normal levels. With the diet change (keto) I no longer take high blood pressure pills. But the anxiety and panic was still there. 

Ready to try anything. I contacted a IV infusion place to maybe get some Vitamins but the lady I talked to recommended IV Glutathione. It was only 80 dollars and am willing to try anything. Monday I done the infusion it took like 15 mins. Since then I have felt like 80% better. Brain fog has been the biggest thing it helped but my anxiety and panic has been reduced A LOT.

No fancy foods or dalgona coffees. Fast forward an year, I was addicted to the gym, tho still not fit by any standards. I was still 97 Kgs. Took some time for me to reach 89-90. Second lockdown hit us. This time I lost 10 kgs during the lockdown because I had shifted my diet to millets, green vegetables and fruits. Again no processed food or anything sweet. After the second lockdown, I had reached a stage where I knew I had become too slim and I didn't want to lose more weight but focus more on building muscle. Started bulking and reached 86-87 and got strong whilst maintaining bf around 15-16%. January 2022, hired an online coach to see how it helps. Took a 6 month plan. Cut myself down to 77. Never checked the BF%. Assuming it should be somewhere around 11-12%. Followed a strict diet with fixed macros. Proper workout routine. And cardio empty stomach in the morning. June 2022, MBA started and I wanted to bulk up whilst staying lean. January 2023 I was 85 kg with good muscle definition and strength. Since then I haven't followed a diet plan because once other things takeover it's hard to follow a strict diet. Only focus was to hit the gym daily, no matter what, be it exams, interviews. I didn't miss. I made time for it. I woke up at 5 even if I slept at 2. Just focused on getting protein rich foods through whole sources. Maintaining myself between 84-87 since then. Just want to tell everyone that if someone like me can do this, u can definitely do it as well and better! So anyone thinking to do it, just do it now that u can before it's too late. The one thing about time is that it's never available, we have to make time. ",239,1730377921.0,Fitness_India,109,0.98,False
1ggdbkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/1ggdbkj/dating_long_distance_across_cultures/,Dating long distance across cultures ,"I recently spent a month in your beautiful country on vacation and met someone unexpectedly.

We went on one date, after matching on Hinge, and met for an hour long coffee while I waited for my flight to another country.

I live in New Zealand, and have been messaging this Norwegian man for the three weeks I've been home, with one video phone call since I've been back. When I waited for my flight and we met up, we both said we'd like to stay in touch and were also speaking about visiting each other.

We've been messaging intermittently since I've been back and I'm trying to stay true to myself and my word and keep on touch so we can meet up again. I do feel like I'm messaging more than him, but trying to let go of expectations and just enjoy the connection for what it is.

My question is, what are some cultural norms when it comes to early dating, long distance, texting, sexual messaging, etc in Norway? 

Our chats jump from every day conversation about our day to sexually intimate with pics. We haven't had any deep conversations about family or anything. I'd like to know this person more, but I feel anxious about leading this conversation. Part of me is like... International casual, but part of me is like, what's the point of that?

We have both reiterate multiple times about visiting each other.

Anyway, some insights would be fab 😊",4,1730377790.0,Norway,10,0.63,False

I have to admit I am quite perplexed with the grind size suggestions provided by Fellow.  I get that every coffee is unique but I am currently using The Roasterie True Blue (medium), only because it was convenient at the time.  I am making 1L of coffee each morning.  I started at grind 7 and I am currently at grind 3.  Yesterday my wife said grind 4 was the best yet.  Referencing the Fellow grind guide I would say I am quite a bit finer than suggested, I am not running over the filter basket during the brew which is good.  Any thoughts or suggestions?

It’s a truth universally acknowledged (at least in certain corners of the internet) that a single woman in possession of a great fortune must have slept her way to the top. Or inherited everything from a rich daddy. Faith Donnelly did neither, working day and night to become CEO of an up-and-coming biotech startup. Yet this doesn’t stop online trolls and talking heads from questioning her credentials and harassing her online.

Hoping to take control of her image, Faith grudgingly agrees to several interviews with the snarky (and annoyingly attractive) tech journalist Ethan Blake. Unexpected sparks begin to fly between Faith and Ethan, but when the articles come out, the online harassment worsens to real-world threats, destroying Faith’s sense of safety and self-worth. As Faith struggles with the increasingly public nature of her role as a CEO, the scrutiny takes a toll on her burgeoning relationship with Ethan. Can she balance her career with her life beyond work, or must she sacrifice her privacy and relationships to achieve the professional success and recognition she craves?

\[TBD title\] is a contemporary romance complete at 75,000 words. It is a gender-swapped homage to *Pride and Prejudice*, exploring the price of success and the power of friendship and love. It will appeal to readers of Emily Henry and Ali Hazelwood.

\[bio\]

A few notes: 

* I know my comps are VERY unreasonable, I'm still kind of working through the exact niche I think this fills, so if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know! 
* I'm also still dithering with the title, and I'm interested in the community’s opinions on how far I should lean into the P&P influence or if it should be avoided. 
* I'm not in love with the final sentence of the blurb, but I'm not sure how else to format it in a concise way.

Thank you everyone!

First 300:

Absurdly large backpacks were the weapons of the oblivious, Faith decided, as she stood on the sidewalk, coffee soaking into her second-favourite shirt. She’d been moving slowly toward the back of the streetcar as her stop approached, when a teenager with an enormous backpack edged in front of her. As he turned, his bag knocked Faith’s hand, sending coffee spattering over her shirt and bag. Faith’s mouth opened in indignation, but the kid blissfully tromped down the streetcar stairs ahead of her, unaware of the mess he’d just caused. Following him out of the streetcar, Faith briefly considered calling out after him to be more careful, but noticed the earbuds he wore which drowned out the world around him.

Faith shook her head, swallowing her frustration, and assessed the damage. A huge stain covered the left side of her cream-coloured button-down, sticking unpleasantly to her bra and skin. This was bad enough, but she’d also barely even had a chance to drink her coffee, which added significantly to the indignity of now wearing most of it instead.

She took a deep breath and then turned to walk the block and a half to the entrance of the enormous office building which housed SothiTech. Though some days the sight of the building struck her with something like disbelief that a company she’d created now took up half of a twenty-story skyscraper, today she was just fixated on making it inside so she could scrub out some of the stain before it set too badly.",1,1730377720.0,PubTips,2,0.67,False

We love discovering new food and places to eat, some that we love but aren’t limited to are Japanese, Korean, Mexican steaks, pizzas and burgers, breads/pastries, foodtrucks! huge fan of coffee hopping! 

We tried to space out activities so not as to have jump packed days as we want to appreciate and spend some time into the places that we will go. We love park strolling, window shopping and to just enjoy sceneries together! 

Hotel and flights are already paid. Tickets to attractions aren’t yet. We are looking in a $2,000-$3,000 budget for food, attractions, tickets etc! Not looking into really buying/shopping stuff! 

No strict time to follow but we plan on doing first whichever’s on the top of the list!

I literally used to go to Starbucks and sit and have a cup of coffee for hours watching outside the window or just scrolling through my phone. 
I thought I would never be with someone. 
Fast forward to today I am married and have a kid and life is pretty good in general, however I have that emptiness and lonely feeling every day. 
I have maybe 1-2 friends that I text, but that’s it. 
I have no friends or family around to talk to, or have a discussion about how I feel or what’s on my mind. I am pretty active in endurance sports and fitness and have a decent job. So it’s not that I have a lot of free time on my hand or get a job, or a hobby isn’t the answer. 
I am not slacking in life, I have a decent income, pay my bills, etc. 
I am not sure what’s missing, but I don’t feel like doing anything. I don’t feel like celebrating anything (holidays, festivals, etc.) 
I have tried to connect with people my age and older to go out for a drink or something and always have been rejected. 
I have talked to my wife about it too and she has no answer to that.

Just to share about something that works a bit for me. I have a relapsed few month ago and negativ symptoms increased. So I am doing again my adapted cold shower the morning and it helps me get my stuff done for the morning hours. The effect get less strong as the day goes, but it gives me some hours of effective motivation.

Regular cold shower do not work for me and increase my disorganization. Maybe because schizophrenia is stress related and that cold shower is actually stressfull for the body. So here is the protocol that get me working and not lost in mental confusion :

* First, I take my usual very warm morning shower (i dont dring coffee, warm shower during the morning is what wake me up). 
* When my body is warm and I feel I got enough warm water (can be 10 minutes, or 20 minutes. Dont juge me please \^\^') I reduce warm water to have temperature were I feel OK but that is not pleasant. 
* I put water on my back and from this point I will look for the temperature that is cold enough to make me gasp. Not more. My purpose is really just to provoc a gasp for air, not colder.
* When I get the right temperature and I gasp for air, I expose my back and my chest with it during 10 to 20 seconde, then stop my shower and begin my day.

If I go too far and get colder, I trigger disorganisation and I can not work nore focus on anything. If I get the good gasp, I can focus.

Hope it helps.

**HourGlass Fit** is a fat-burning supplement designed for women, using **natural ingredients** that are safe for daily use. It helps reduce cravings, boost workout energy, and burn calories efficiently. A key ingredient, **Glucomannan** (at 3000mg per serving), helps you feel fuller longer to prevent overeating. The formula also includes vitamins, minerals, and **Capsimax** to enhance fat burning without the side effects of caffeine-heavy products.

If you want something simple and effective for everyday use, [**HourGlass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php) is definitely worth considering and **I’d rate it at 4.5 / 5.**

## How Does HourGlass Fit work?

- **Reduces calorie intake**: Contains **Glucomannan**, a fiber that expands in your stomach, making you feel fuller and naturally cutting down snacking or binge eating.
- **Provides a sustained energy boost**: Natural ingredients offer a **steady energy boost** without the jitters or crashes, helping you work out harder and stay active longer.
- HIgh quality Non-stimulant fat burner for women
- **Manages cravings**: Helps stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing cravings for carbs or sweets, making it easier to stick to your diet.
- **Tackles weight loss from multiple angles**: Addresses cravings, energy levels, and calorie burning.

## Key Ingredients of HourGlass Fit

**Vitamin B6 (as Pyridoxine 5-Phosphate) 1.7mg** – This vitamin supports metabolism by helping the body convert food into energy, while also playing a role in maintaining brain health and reducing fatigue.

**Vitamin B12 (as Adenosylcobalamin) 2.4µg** – Essential for energy production and red blood cell formation, Vitamin B12 helps fight fatigue and supports overall cognitive function.

**Chromium (as Chromium Picolinate) 125µg** – Chromium helps regulate blood sugar levels, reducing cravings for carbs and sweets, which can aid in appetite control and weight management.

**Zinc (as Citrate) 8mg** – Zinc is vital for immune support, but it also plays a role in metabolism and protein synthesis, making it beneficial for muscle recovery and overall health.

**Vitamin B2 (as Riboflavin) 1.1mg** – This vitamin helps convert food into energy and supports normal cell function and fat metabolism, promoting overall vitality.

**Konjac Root Extract (Standardized to 90% Glucomannan) 3000mg** – Glucomannan is a water-soluble fiber that expands in your stomach, helping to reduce appetite and promote feelings of fullness, which can lead to lower calorie intake.

**Cayenne Pepper Extract (as Capsimax®) 100mg** – Capsaicinoids in cayenne pepper help increase metabolism and promote fat burning by generating heat in the body, aiding in calorie expenditure.

**Black Pepper Extract (as Bioperine™) 5mg** – Bioperine enhances the absorption of other nutrients in the supplement, making the ingredients more effective in promoting weight loss and overall health.

**5-HTP (Griffonia simplicifolia extra) 150mg** – 5-HTP increases serotonin levels, helping to improve mood and reduce emotional eating, which can assist in better diet adherence.

## How to Use HourGlass Fit

Taking **HourGlass Fit** is simple: just take **four capsules daily**, one before each meal with water to help curb overeating. No need for complicated shakes or powders—just take the capsules. Consistency is key for better results over time.

If you struggle to remember, setting a reminder on your phone can help.

However, I recommend using a **_simple whey based protein meal shake along with it_**. Here’s a simple plan to use **Hourglass Fit** (which contains glucomannan) and a **whey protein meal replacement shake** to maximize your weight loss results:

### **Morning:**

- **Breakfast**: Start your day with a **whey protein shake** (around 25-30g of protein, less than 200 calories). This will provide energy and curb your appetite for the morning, while keeping calories low. You can also drink black coffee or green tea to help with energy and appetite suppression.
- **Hourglass Fit**: Take **1 capsule of Hourglass Fit** about 30 minutes before breakfast with a full glass of water. The glucomannan in it will expand in your stomach, making you feel full and reducing cravings throughout the day.

### **Midday:**

- **Lunch**: Have a balanced, low-calorie meal that includes high protein (e.g., lean chicken, fish, or tofu) and vegetables. This will help keep you full while maintaining a calorie deficit.
- **Hourglass Fit**: Take another capsule about 30 minutes before lunch, again with water. This will help control your appetite and prevent overeating.

### **Afternoon/Evening:**

- **Snack or Light Dinner**: If you get hungry in the afternoon, another **protein shake** or a light snack (like Greek yogurt or a boiled egg) will keep you going. For dinner, aim for another balanced meal similar to lunch, prioritizing protein and vegetables.
- **Hourglass Fit**: Take the final dose of **Hourglass Fit** 30 minutes before your evening meal with water. This will help you avoid overeating at night.

### **Extra Tips:**

- Drink plenty of water throughout the day, as glucomannan needs water to expand and work effectively.
- Incorporate light cardio or resistance training to help burn extra calories and support muscle maintenance
- Avoid sugary snacks or drinks, and focus on eating whole foods like vegetables, lean meats, and healthy fats to support your calorie deficit.

By combining **Hourglass Fit** and **whey protein shakes**, this plan helps keep your calories low while making you feel fuller for longer, helping you lose weight efficiently.

## Customer Reviews and Testimonials

- The general consensus from users is that **HourGlass Fit** really helps with **appetite control** and provides a steady **energy boost** throughout the day.
- A lot of women appreciate the fact that it helps them avoid the usual pitfalls of dieting—especially cravings for sugary or carb-heavy foods. One user mentioned that she stopped snacking between meals after just a few days of use, which was a game-changer for her weight loss journey.

- Overall, users seem pleased with how **natural** HourGlass Fit is on their system while still delivering results.
- Of course, there are a few mixed reviews, mostly from people who didn’t see results as quickly as they hoped. Although, some noted that it took about a month of consistent use before they noticed any major differences.

## What sets HourGlass Fit it apart?

- **It’s natural**: Unlike many fat burners that are packed with caffeine and stimulants, **HourGlass Fit** uses natural ingredients.
- **Gentle yet effective**: The natural formula is gentle on the body but still effective in supporting weight loss goals.
- **Controls cravings efficiently**: While most fat burners only focus on boosting metabolism, **HourGlass Fit** helps curb your appetite with **Glucomannan**, making you feel fuller and reducing snacking.
- **Transparent ingredient profile**: Unlike other products that use **proprietary blends**, HourGlass Fit is open about its ingredients and dosages, so you know exactly what you're taking.
- **Formulated for women**: Designed specifically to align with women’s metabolism and nutritional needs, making it more tailored than generic fat burners.
- **Stimulant-free**: If you’re looking for a fat burner without harsh stimulants, HourGlass Fit provides a well-rounded option that goes beyond just burning calories.

## Pros and Cons of HourGlass Fit

**Pros**:

- **Natural Ingredients**: Everything in HourGlass Fit is plant-based or naturally derived, so you don’t have to worry about synthetic chemicals.
- **Craving Control**: Thanks to **Glucomannan**, you’ll feel fuller for longer, which can make a huge difference if you tend to snack between meals.
- **No Jitters**: Unlike many fat burners loaded with caffeine, HourGlass Fit provides a **gentle energy boost** without the unpleasant side effects like nervousness or insomnia.
- **Specifically Designed for Women**: This supplement is tailored for women’s bodies and weight loss goals, so it's more personalized than generic fat burners.

**Cons**:

- **Price**: HourGlass Fit is on the premium side, so it might be a bit pricey if you’re on a budget.
- **No Instant Results**: Like most natural supplements, HourGlass Fit works gradually, so do not expect immediate weight loss. You need to take it every day **consistently** to see the best results.

## My final Performance Evaluation (Ratings)

### **Appetite Suppression: 4.5/5**

With **Glucomannan** as a key ingredient, appetite suppression is effective. Most users report feeling fuller for longer, reducing snacking and overeating, making it one of the strongest aspects of the product.

### **Metabolism Boost: 4/5**

The inclusion of **Capsimax® (Cayenne Pepper Extract)** helps with metabolism, but the effects are moderate and rely on consistent use. It won't give you a dramatic boost, but it aids fat burning in the long term.

### **Energy Enhancement: 3.5/5**

While **HourGlass Fit** provides a **gentle energy boost**, it's not as strong as other fat burners with higher caffeine content. The energy support is steady and sufficient for daily activities and light exercise, without crashes.

### **Stimulant-like Effects: 2/5**

This product is very low in stimulants, which can be both good and bad. If you want jitter-free energy, it’s perfect, but if you’re looking for a major **stimulant boost**, this isn’t the product for you.

### **Fat Burning: 3.5/5**

Fat burning is gradual with **HourGlass Fit**, mainly through appetite suppression and metabolism support. While it works, it’s not a quick-fix fat burner and requires regular use alongside a healthy diet and exercise. **If you use a whey protein meal replacement shake along with it, you should see better fat loss results!**

### **Safety Profile: 5/5**

With natural ingredients and minimal stimulants, **HourGlass Fit** has an excellent safety profile. There are very few reports of side effects, making it a reliable option for long-term use.

### **Price/Value for Money: 3/5**

1ggd0su,https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1ggd0su/nandu_urf_chugalkhor_mehra/,Nandu urf chugalkhor Mehra ,"What a clever man. He knew that bigg Boss aired all his backbitching about Vivian so why not play reverse psychology with audience.

He very well knew if he accepts that he is jealous of Vivian because of his succes, shows , looks then audience will be like omg KV you are better looking than him

KV you are the best , KV you won KKK

KV is such a manipulator who always talks audience is watching , your family is watching but he never talks about if his family is watching or not. His daddy/ papa jokes aren't savage. 

He questions viv for hanging out with Avinash that why is he with them...Avinash is 28 years old. Viv is 36 yrs so he is only 8 years older than him. In workplace , it's common to have friends of different age group. I have a best friend who is 10 years older than me at my workplace. 

Maturity doesn't come from age and KV is example of it. Mr. Age card doesn't mind making romantic angle with chum who is 8 years younger than him. Chum looks like his assistant. She has no opinion of her own but Mr. KV is selectively blind as he calls Avinash and Viv as assistant of each other.

Viv and Avi had their own set of disagreements in initial weeks but they didn't went personal with each other. Even in food train task , it was Avinash who gave food to Vivian to save him from nominations, which was denied by his muh boli sister Shrutika.

After first fight of KV and Avinash, Viv made KV privately understand that keechad mein haath mat haath daalo, it was a good advise by friend.

Avi started to have soft corner for viv after his fake eviction, when everyone was against him , it was viv who made him understand where he went wrong and he shouldn't have crossed certain lines..he even asked him to not go personal..
Viv was the first one to ask chum if she felt safe or not.

During wkw, Mr. Nandu asked passive aggressively Vivian yes/no question, the body language and tone of kV wasn't of a friend. If kV really considered viv as a friend, he would have discussed with viv before wkw but Mr. Nandu took it as an opportunity to put down viv because answer was never in yes/no, the whole situation was in grey area.

Viv and Avi have different perspective regarding game and I have seen in livefeed where viv always told avi that don't cross the line and he won't correct his pov because everyone is an individual here.
Avinash who made eisha and Alice cry in torture task, he was easily ready to give coffee to vivian. Avinash might be a nuisance to each otf the housemates but he is damn nice to vivian so why should vivian fight with him when kV group didn't take a second to go against him. Avinash was the only one who defended vivian in leadership topic during wkw and viv never had any expectations from Avinash so definitely viv will be more inclined towards him.

Mr..Nandu conveniently calls viv as his friend during bharta topic and he even lied that I didn't eat, the matter was stretched because of kV lying.. kv calls viv junior artist but suddenly viv is more successful than KV.

Mr. Nandu says no one will beat each other and stops everyone from stopping the fights but he conveniently didn't go to jail because he might get physical with Avinash. He is doubtful to his patience level but others are mindful. Rajat was manhandling Avinash but Mr. Nandu was like don't stop it. Cowardice behaviour because KV's intention was to get Rajat or Avinash out of the house.

KV was ready to give basic ration to everyone but he and his group bullied chahat for making food. KV was so insensitive during CA of chahat, he was like go and say to him main bhi tere se pyaar karti hu. He doesn't have any soft spot for chahat, he just egged on chahat as an opportunity to against Avinash because on wkw , Mr. KV didn't even raise his hand when Salman asked if avinash was wrong. It was bagga who supported chahat in CA matter really otherwise nandu is just an opportunist who sets fake narratives against everyone. 

Also KV knows very well how people are perceived outside like how he knew chahat must be getting sympathy. He has mastered in bigg Boss course so he already knew that shilpa's betrayal in raja task will get him sympathy that's why he is so good friend to Shilpa as he burned the bridges with vivian. He will be nice to Shilpa so that Audience says kv is so nice that he didn't get upset with Shilpa , he is so good friend. Whatever I dislike Mr. Nandu urf victim and fake narrative setter.

1ggczo2,https://i.redd.it/0hejchaf23yd1.jpeg,"Few questions regarding: root canal, floss smell, and a tooth (potential cavity? With image)","1. I had a root canal done months ago and from time to time it’ll throb within the “tooth” as though sensitive but it shouldn’t have any feeling whatsoever right? What could this mean? It kinda feels like it’s being tugged on when I make a suction feeling in my mouth (not sure how else to explain it)

2. I’ve had my gums checked and brought up the smell concern and the oral hygienist didn’t bring up any concerns/red flags but when I floss my teeth especially more toward the back on each side regardless of just brushing or flossing the floss smells terrible like sewage.

3. In this photo, does this look like a cavity? As you can see there’s a filling from last year there.

I vape (in the process of quitting), drink very occasionally, and I drink probably 3 sugar free redbull and 2 coffees a week if that matters. Oh and I grind my teeth in my sleep. 

I have had a lot of fillings done, I tend to get cavities easily something regarding my enamel. ",1,1730376731.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1ggcyle,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ggcyle,Millie's Cookies - MCIA Terminal 1 Departure Area,"My family was mentioning to me this cookie stall na nasa Mactan Airport Terminal 1, so I went for it para naay pasalubong sa ilaha pag-abot nako sa akong hometown sa Davao during the long weekend.

There I knew the stall was Millie's Cookies, but never thought this was a UK brand. According to their website, Millie's Cookies is ""a chain of retail bakeries based in the United Kingdom, specializing in cookies, muffins, hot drinks and gifts."" Naintriga jud ko so nipalit ko. 

I bought a Treat Box worth 310 pesos composed of 6 regular sizes cookies. Each cookie is individually priced at 55 to 65 pesos for regular size and 120-135 pesos for the large size. I went for all flavors: plain, smores, red velvet, choco chip, double choco, and matcha. Of course kay di na gyud malikayan ang gutom, nipalit na lang pod ko isa ka large matcha cookie. 

When I ate the cookie, it was the chewiest, crumbliest, most flavorful matcha cookie I ever ate. Lami ang pagka matcha flavor niya and dili kaayo tam-is. Solid 10/10 for me.

I shared the box with my family in Davao and they really loved it! 

Haven't tried the coffee but hope I can try them once I have another flight sa MCIA soon.

Sayang naa ra ni sa Airport as far as I know. Hope they branch out within Cebu soon.
