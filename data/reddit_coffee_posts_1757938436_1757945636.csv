1nhmwxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TAZCirclejerk/comments/1nhmwxi/schmecap_schmetail/,Schmecap: Schmetail,"Alright jerkers let's fucking go. I'm looking at Shmanners from the oldest episodes, in...Jesus Christ, February 2016? They've been doing this shit for almost a *decade*? 

I thought I would do their 10th episode, St. Patrick's Day, bc I am an Irish-American who likes to think of herself as not one of *those* Irish-Americans, and it was a Max Fun Drive episode, so I figured, this has to be good jerk material. But I got about 2 minutes in, Travis did a MFD plug where he said ""hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of bonus content,"" Teresa said ""I'm also Irish, and German, and Scandinavian, and you can tell because I'm so tall and blonde,"" and I decided I do not hate myself enough to endure the rest of the podcast, so you will not get that schmecap from me. 

Anyway, in November 2016, Travis and Teresa decided to school their listeners on the etiquette of RETAIL. It's been a while, so I may be forgetting something, but I think it's fair to say that this podcast is the worst thing that happened in November 2016, so let's dive on in.

* Episode description: ""Hello Internet! After a brief baby leave, we are back! This time, we're talking RETAIL ETIQUETTE! How do you talk to a retail employee?""
   * Bad start here already. Retail employees aren't another species and statistically almost all of your listeners have been or are retail employees, and the tone indicates you aren't considering that.
* ""Where did department stores and supermarkets come from? How do you speed up the whole shopping process? What's the history behind shopping stuff anyway? All that, plus even more answers to your questions! Enjoy and don't forget to share!""
   * So already I am seeing very little mention of anything that could be called ""etiquette."" I know the premise is too narrow to sustain the show for ten years, particularly when neither host knows anything about it, but I'm a little surprised they dropped off the premise *this* fast. This was only like 9 months into their run. How have they kept it going for *nine more years*?
* ""I almost forgot how we did this. It's been..."" **One week since you looked at me**
* ""You might hear Bebe during the recording. She's in a bassinet sitting next to me."" Trav I think that might mean you should have taken some more time off. Trust me. Nobody was itching for an episode of Shmanners. You could have taken a month or two off, instead of two weeks.
* On the other hand, get them kids in those podcast mines asap!
* ""I have extensive retail experience."" Loss prevention isn't real retail, the same way that cops aren't real labor. You are a class traitor and a capitalist running dog. Prevent deez nuts.
* ""Does a restaurant count as retail?"" Shut the fuck up Teresa you know it doesn't.
* ""As long as people have been interacting with other people, there have been exchanges of goods."" Teresa I swear to god if you make me listen to a history of buying things from the Paleolithic I'm gonna piledrive you through a table.
* Travis's mic is really bad. He sounds like he's at the bottom of a stairwell, which is cool if you're recording drums for ""When the Levee Breaks"" on Led Zeppelin IV and very much uncool when you're recording a podcast. Maybe you could go to a retail store and get some acoustic panels.
* ""I've always had trouble with currency, like the concept of it. When we talk about bartering, that just makes so much more sense. Trading goods and services instead of pieces of paper that we all agree are worth something."" WEE WOO WEE WOO LIBERTARIAN TRAVIS ALERT.
   * Travis you'd better be glad we have those pieces of paper because *nobody* is gonna give you a chicken in exchange for ten minutes of reacting to your wife reading a wikipedia article.
* GET IM TERESA 
   * ""Travis, please remember that if we bartered, the person bartering always has to produce.""
* ""Currency is first introduced in Mesopotamia.""
   * Teresa. Teresa. Please don't do this.
   * Taking a break long enough to listen to [the B-52s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNneyVMK2XM) explain this period of human history better
   * ""Before I talk, I should read a book"" is advice T&T would do well to take
* ""Instead of each person having one thing that they do, these goods and services are mashed into one place. In the United States, these are called general stores."" 
   * Holy shit Teresa
   * I know I said I didn't want you to cover the entire history of commerce from Mesopotamia to the present but ""there was currency in Mesopotamia, and then there were general stores in the United States"" is a little more yada-yada then I wanted. Real whiplash from that.
   * Also how dare you talk about commerce in Mesopotamia without mentioning my man, the purveyor of the highest-quality copper in the land, let's give it up for Ea-Nasir!
* ""It's always funny to me that we use patronize in two very different ways. Like, you patronized Best Buy. You went to Best Buy and were like, \[doing an obnoxious voice\] Oh, hey, do you need anything? What can I do for you?""
   * This isn't anything, and bless her, Teresa no-sells *hard*. She just goes straight into the next sentence of her script.
* Unfortunately, that next sentence is, ""Interestingly, many of the goods in these general stores were bartered for. People would look over the goods and say, hmmm, I'll give you fifteen cents for these.""
   * I take back the credit I gave Teresa for sandbagging Travis on ""patronizing,"" because that's *haggling,* not *bartering*.
   * She uses haggling in the next sentence so she knows the word. Maybe I shouldn't be mean about this; she had a baby two weeks before recording, everyone misspeaks from time to time, and, as everyone knows, it's impossible to edit recorded audio.
* ""These stores, in general..."" ""General stores in general? Eh? Eh?"" ""...Right. These stores, in general, didn't change much until the arrival of the department store.""
   * Another great Teresa sandbag. That wasn't anything and Trav deserved to be left hanging.
* ""I apologize for not going chronologically, I know I was talking about the United States and 1910, but I'm going to jump across the pond to London in 1796.""
   * I forgive you for breaking linear time but not for saying ""across the pond."" Let's have a butcher's at this first department store.
* ""This was the first shop really catering to women, because prior to that, shopping was largely handled by men."" ""You know what I always say! Men be shopping!""
   * I'm taking ibuprofen because of this, Travis.
* ""Are we the Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of our day?"" ""No."" ""What about the Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of podcasting?"" ""I don't think that's a title we can claim. You're in rare form today."" I suppose I should be grateful that Travis doesn't reference Prince Albert in a can, at least.
* Teresa talks about supermarkets growing out of people with fresh foods setting up stalls outside of dry goods stores since people were already shopping there, and it's fine, I guess, nothing to jerk about except she mentions an early supermarket, Piggly Wiggly, and Travis says Piggly Wiggly a lot bc he thinks it's funny, and it's as annoying as you think.
* She talks about big box stores as ""supersized general stores"" and says nothing about how they destroyed society but honestly probably for the best.
* ***AD BREAK***
   * These are all MaxFun ads and I don't care. Skip skip skip.
* ""The big umbrella tip I would give is you catch more flies with honey.""
   * This isn't wrong, but ""be nice"" as an etiquette tip is nothing.
   * I did think for a second Travis was giving this as advice to retail employees as to how to interact with customers, but he's giving it to customers, and you know what, nothing to criticize here.
* Travis actually says something that I think is a good point: Remove ""I just"" from your shopping vocabulary, because everyone ""just"" wants what they want. ""People cut to the front of lines and say 'I just need to return this shirt.' Well, lots of people need to buy and return shirts. 'I just need help finding this one thing.' Well, the person I'm already working with just needs help finding something. Everyone's time is equally valuable, and that includes the person working."" No notes! You're actually right, Travis!
   * Food service is obviously different than retail, but one pet peeve I had in my 7 years in the Starbucks trenches was the people who came up and said, ""Can I just get"" before listing off like 9 items. ""Can I just get a black coffee?"" Sure, that's a sentence that makes sense! ""Can I just get a caramel ribbon crunch, extra caramel, three ham and cheese croissants, a hot white mocha, two cake pops, an iced green tea with 38 pumps of classic, and an iced caramel macchiato?"" You can get all of those things but you need to learn the definition of ""just.""
      * Related but even more annoying: ""Can I just get a latte?"" ""Sure, what size? Hot or iced? Okay, is there anything else I can do for you?"" ""I think I want a cheese danish."" ""Great, will that be everything?"" ""I also need three strawberry refreshers."" ""Alright, is that all for you?"" ""Bacon gouda."" You should not have led with ""can I just"" and also, just give your order, do not make me prompt you for everything.
* ""The more information you have that you can provide the salesperson, the smoother it will be for everyone."" Also solid advice, Trav!
   * He talks about a woman who wanted to get a DVD for her son at Best Buy, and she did not know the name of the movie, any of the cast, what the movie's about, director, nothing except for ""the cover is purple,"" and how he had to spend 45 minutes trying to find it, and I think we've all had enough customers like that to sympathize.
   * ""So a lot of the time, if you see employees on the floor who don't stop and help you, it's because they're dealing with phone calls like that."" Actually a good tip that someone without retail experience (or at least who hasn't worked retail since the Carter administration) might not realize!
      * Granted, basically nobody who needs to hear that would be listening to this podcast, but whaddya gonna do.
* ""Ask about the store's return policy *before* you buy something."" Again, not bad advice. 
* Oh no, he's talking about shoplifting now.
   * ""I sent people to jail for shoplifting expensive items from Best Buy. It's a very serious crime. It's not a fun dare."" These nuts are a very serious crime on your chin.
*  Btw, Teresa keeps mentioning a Victorian guide to shopping etiquette but other than saying ""yep, that's what it says in here too"" in response to Travis she does not actually do anything with it, despite that being, y'know, the premise of the podcast.
* Listener question time!
   * And are these ""listeners"" in the room right now?
   * These questions are actually related to the topic, which means at some point, T&T were organized and dedicated enough to post topics ahead of time and solicit questions, and that is *astonishing* given how hard the McElroys phone it in now.
      * I suppose it's also possible they just always collect etiquette questions and save the relevant ones for the topic they're relevant to, but that's *also* more work than they'd put in today.
* ""If I decide not to buy something, what should I do with it?"" ""Depends on the store."" That's a paraphrase but like. Great, this is nothing. ""Depends on the store.""
* ""Is it rude to say 'I'm just looking' if you don't feel like talking to a retail employee?"" ""I think there are better ways to express that you don't need assistance. I think they might feel lied to if they see you picking up things.""
   * Even Teresa immediately realizes that's an insane way to put it and says, ""Maybe 'lied to' is too harsh. But there are definitely less rude ways to decline assistance.""
   * I think it's obvious but as far as I'm concerned, this is something where tone matters a lot. ""I'm just looking right now, thanks!"" is one thing, but you can absolutely say it in an aggressive manner that makes the employee's day worse and you should not say it that way.
* ""When you have a full cart and someone comes up behind you with just a couple of items, do you let them cut in front? I think that's a courtesy but not required."" Well, yeah, you already have the idea, not sure why you're asking these two chuckleheads to confirm it.
* ""What's the current faux pas status of headphones/earbuds on in checkout?"" You also know this. Don't fuckin do that.
   * Teresa is more generous than me, bc she says that it might be okay to leave them in with your music off if you're just getting one or two things, but take them off if you have a bigger transaction.
   * Travis says it doesn't matter how big the transaction, at least take out one headphone so the cashier knows you're paying attention to them, and if you don't want that, then self checkout. Can't believe I'm agreeing with Big Dog.
   * Teresa says she's self-conscious about self checkout bc she knows people behind her want her to move fast. Travis says he knows he can move faster than most cashiers so he loves self checkout, and calls it hubris, so at least he's self-aware.
   * Another advantage to self checkout is it's a lot easier to do things that Travis would send you to jail for.
      * Too damn bad. If this trillion dollar company didn't want me to take two 12 packs of Dr Pepper while only paying for one, they could pay for actual cashiers instead of foisting the labor onto their customers. You expect me to do all the scanning and bagging? Well you didn't train me for that, oops I missed a scan. Hypothetically. Metaphorically.
* ""Is there a limit to how many items you can take to self checkout?"" 
   * Teresa says unless it's posted, there's no limit. 
   * Travis, once again the unlikely voice of reason, says trust your gut, and don't hold up the line with a full cart.
   * Teresa backpedals and explains she doesn't mean you *should* self checkout with a full cart, just that there's no policy against it.
      * Hey dipshit, this is an etiquette podcast, your whole *thing* is unwritten rules of conduct, maybe you should've said that in the first place. Like your whole concept is telling people about social rules that are like, obviously a London Met copper isn't gonna stroll in and hit you with a truncheon for grabbing the wrong fork, but people around you will find you rude. 
* ""After you've clocked out, what's a polite way to tell a customer you're no longer on the clock when they ask you for help?""
   * Man no place I've ever worked paid me enough to worry about that. ""Sorry, I'm not on the clock, \[Person\] over there can help you.""
   * ""When you clock out, you need to either leave, or if you're wearing a work shirt or a name badge, change."" Fuck off Travis, I'm not bringing a second fucking shirt to work just because I need to buy something after my shift. 
* Teresa quotes Emily Post to wrap up, then points out she changed the word ""saleswoman"" in the quoted text ""because I think it applies equally to anyone."" ""Right, it's 2016!"" I hate you both.

Anyway! There was some stuff that wasn't completely horrible, and this is a Shmanners episode that managed *not* to say something shockingly racist about Native people. Absolutely not worth 45 minutes of your life, but it didn't make me angry enough to risk a major cardiac incident, so, y'know.

1nhmwbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1nhmwbe/explore_if_tide_laundry_powder_lives_up_to_its/,Explore If Tide Laundry Powder Lives Up to Its Trusted Name,"Testing out the Tide CHEER laundry powder was an experience grounded in both convenience and quality. As someone who deals with heaps of laundry weekly, from sweaty gym wear to delicates, I’ve put my fair share of detergents to the test. This compact little powerhouse of a product, mere ounces in size, intrigued me from the get-go. The first thing that caught my attention was its portability. It’s one of the rare products of its kind that truly seems tailored for travel enthusiasts or those looking for a space-efficient laundry solution.

**Small but Mighty: Cleaning Performance**  
I wasn’t sure what to expect from a laundry powder packaged so compactly, but the results spoke for themselves. Even though I was skeptical, I tested it on a particularly nasty coffee stain that had taken up residence on a kitchen towel. After one wash, the spot had faded significantly. A second run? Totally spotless. It also left my clothes smelling fresh without feeling like they were doused in artificial fragrance—it’s a subtle, clean scent I could appreciate. Thanks to its effective cleaning power, even in cold water, it feels less wasteful and energy-hogging.  

**Perfect for On-the-Go Use**  
This is honestly where the Tide CHEER laundry powder shines the most. I tossed it into my duffel bag during a weekend getaway and didn’t even notice the additional weight. It’s perfect for those moments in a hotel room where you need to rinse a few T-shirts or light fabrics and can’t lug around full-sized liquid detergent bottles. The size is ideal, and it proved itself to be an indispensable part of my travel essentials by keeping everything clean and fresh.  

[Check Tide CHEER price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b001jt024k/)  

**Pros**  
• Extremely portable and travel-friendly  
• Effective at removing tough stains  
• Works well for both hot and cold-water washing  
• Trusted national brand ensures reliability  

**Pitfalls**  
• The size is great for travel but impractical for large households needing frequent use  
• Limited quantity per package—definitely not a bulk buy alternative  

**User-Friendly Packaging**  
Its easy-open packaging deserves a quick mention. Some well-designed powder detergents come encased in overcomplicated boxes that end up spilling everywhere—I’ve dealt with a few, let me just say. However, this one seals securely, keeping things clean and compact. It also avoids that annoying problem of clunky lids you’d find on liquid detergents.  

**Product Rivals**  
While Tide CHEER is a convenient solution, it’s directly competing with liquid detergent travel pouches and compact laundry pods, which dominate the portable cleaning market. Compared to liquid options, the powder avoids potential spill disasters. However, compact pods like those from other leading competitors offer easier measurement and require even less handling. On the functionality front, it matches its peers but edges slightly above due to impressive stain-fighting power in hot or cold conditions.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Tide CHEER stands out within its price range purely for travel-focused or emergency use. While it doesn’t serve the average household as a primary detergent choice, its convenience factor and stain-cleaning power make it worth the slight premium over generic alternatives. You’re paying extra for quality and portability, not just a name brand slapped onto packaging.

There are five episodes for this fan arc, and I'll be posting one episode every weekday.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our story begins in SMG3's ""evil villain lair"" beneath III's Coffee N Bombs, where SMG3 is going through his old devices and weapons from his days as a villain. Some of them don't work anymore. Some of them are too *eeeeevil*. And some just aren't *eeeeevil* enough. But there was one device he found in the pile that he never got around to using: a spiral-like device used for hypnosis. SMG3's Hypno-Wheel. He wonders if it still even works, and decides to take it out for a spin (pardon the pun). But who should he test it on?

Just then, Eggdog alerts SMG3 that two new customers have entered III's Coffee N Bombs: Meggy and Tari. Actually, they mostly came to use the free Wi-Fi (and yes, that was influenced by the latest episode of SMG4: Meme Mayhem). Regardless, SMG3 gets the idea to test his Hypno-Wheel on the girls! Only then would he know if it still worked. After getting their attention, SMG3 spins his Hypno-Wheel in Meggy and Tari's direction, and lo and behold, they were thrust into a deep trance.

It worked.

Now that he knows for sure that his Hypno-Wheel still works, SMG3 wonders just what he should have Meggy and Tari do. Act like chickens? Clean the cafe, perhaps? No...even better! He makes Meggy and Tari think they're Mario and Luigi, respectively. Imagine...those two girls acting like the Mario Brothers. That would be funny...to him.

What follows is a montage of Meggy and Tari doing very ""Mario Bros."" things. As Mario, Meggy gets into that platforming goodness while going through World 1-1, and giving Bowser a hard time for good measure despite him doing nothing wrong. Tari, meanwhile, is doing what Luigi does in *his* home series: sucking up ghosts in a haunted house. As an added bonus, starting with this montage, Meggy and Tari are depicted in their plumber models made by AnEyeArtist.

(Note: From this point forward, Meggy and Tari will be referred to as ""Meggario"" and ""LuTari"" until they are inevitably released from their hypnosis)

After the montage is finished, we join Meggario and LuTari walking down the street in the city, as they can't help but find something was missing throughout their adventures...or rather, some*one*. Neither of them had seen Princess Peach all day. Meggario couldn't find her in the already-mentioned scuffle with Bowser, so where was she? Was she in trouble elsewhere? Kidnapped by another evil party? Of course, *true* SMG4 fans know what *really* happened to her, and that's going to play a part in this later.

Eventually, Meggario and LuTari come across SMG4 sitting on a park bench watching memes on his laptop. Mistaking him for a regular Mushroom Kingdom citizen (since their hypnosis prevents them from recognizing him), they approach SMG4 and ask him if he's seen the princess. SMG4 finds it weird that Meggy and Tari would dress and talk like the Mario Bros., but he assumes they're cosplaying and plays along with it. He jokingly tells ""Mario"" and ""Luigi"" that he might have seen Peach walking into a costume party on the other side of town, making Meggario and LuTari relieved that the princess isn't in any danger.

Yes, there's a costume party in the city. It's hosted by Bob, who advertises it as an exciting event for people to have fun...and *definitely* not as a way to overcharge for admission in a get-rich-quick scheme, if *that's* what you're thinking. There is currently a wide variety of costumes worn by people in attendance--including princesses--so finding Peach will be harder than Meggario and LuTari thought.

Later at the Showgrounds, SMG4 talks to SMG3 about the oddity he saw earlier in the day; Meggy and Tari acting like Mario and Luigi. This prompts SMG3 to--rather nonchalantly--admit to SMG4 that he hypnotized them to think they're the Mario Bros.

""Oh, well, that was nice of y.......WAIT, WHAT?!""

An argument breaks out as SMG4 calls SMG3 out for doing that to two innocent girls. SMG3 brushes it off as just some harmless fun, saying the worst he's done was indirectly send them on a wild goose chase to find a princess that's trapped several feet beneath where her castle once stood. This quickly bites him in the ass when the two meme guardians see that Meggario and LuTari, whose search for the princess led them to the Showgrounds, overheard them. Now that they know where Peach *truly* is, they resolve to descend to that very chasm to do what the Mario Bros. do best: rescue the princess.

It's at this point that SMG3 realizes the weight of his actions. If Meggy and Tari were to get trapped in the chasm as well and/or die down there, he could lose two potential customers! Truly a horrible thought! Luckily, it just so happens that SMG3 remembers implementing a secret trigger phrase to undo the hypnosis. From there, it was a race to the old castle grounds...or what's left of them.

Although Meggario and LuTari get there first, they have yet to jump into the chasm, as Meggario spent quite a bit of time reassuring a nervous LuTari that whatever horrors they may face down there, they'll always have each other. They take their time preparing to jump in...which is just enough time for SMG4 and 3 to shout the secret trigger phrase in unison.

""THANK YOU MARIO, BUT OUR PRINCESS IS IN ANOTHER CASTLE!""

The meme guardians were just in time, as Meggy and Tari stop what they were doing and shake their heads, as a clear indication that the hypnotic spell is broken. Naturally, the girls have some questions. What are they doing in the old castle grounds? Why are they so close to the edge of the chasm? Why are they wearing plumber overalls? Is that a taste of spaghetti in their mouths? Their confusion turns to anger when they remember: SMG3 hypnotized them!

Now SMG3 is facing two *very* pissed off women, who even get out their weapons (one of Meggy's Splatoon-inspired weapons and Tari's arm-cannon) for the desire to teach him a lesson. SMG3 tries to calm them down by apologizing for hypnotizing them, and reveals that he brought his Hypno-Wheel with him...not to use it on them again, but to throw it into the demonic pit so that he nor anyone else can be tempted to use it. Surprisingly, this was enough to appease Meggy and Tari's anger, so long as he promises never to try anything like this again.

...that is, until they hear mad cackling nearby. Turns out, that cackling was from Saiko boasting about acquiring treasure that was likely stolen, *also* dressed in her plumber outfit made by AnEyeArtist. It was easy for Meggy and Tari to figure out that SMG3 hypnotized Saiko to act like Wario, and get out their weapons once more.

Cue a cartoony chase over the hills.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And that was the start of my idea for the arc before WOTFI 2025. As you can tell, it has little to do with the overarching conflict started by the ""Guns N' Puzzles"" movie, and mostly serves as a silly episode before shit gets real, which is kind of tradition in SMG4 by this point. That said, it ends at a pretty important place in the Puzzlevision Saga (the demonic pit where Peach's castle once stood), which I think is going to come back soon, given Toomp and the Death Cube's similarities to the demonic goop.

Tune in tomorrow for Episode 2: ""When Is Daddy Coming Home?"". This one will have Mr. Puzzles, Mr. WPNZ, and the Katphish family in it.",2,1757945319.0,SMG4,0,1.0,False

Not getting the great energy everyone is talking about but at least some slight mood improvement, but little to no weight loss(6’1, 215lb). I dropped coffee like a month ago and that actually made a positive impact on my well being, although right after dropping it, I’ve been having itchy eyes that become red if I rub them and that hasn’t gone away. Also taking some supplements to support the oxalate dumping process. Maybe an explanation for not getting the benefits so soon is probably cause I went straight from a (relatively healthy) standard diet to carnivore. One more possible culprit is a ParaGuard supplement i took for a month before starting the diet, and im not sure how that may have affected by gut health. Diet is primarily beef, butter, bacon, and eggs salted generously with the occasional cheese and kefir. Maybe I just have a longer adaptation period?

But how do you find the best one? Coffee lovers know that the right grinder makes a difference. Freshly ground beans bring out the best flavors. With so many options, picking the right grinder is crucial. Blade or burr? Manual or electric?

Each type has its pros and cons. Your choice will depend on your brewing style and taste preferences. A good grinder ensures consistent particle size. This consistency impacts the quality of your brew. Whether you prefer espresso or French press, the right grinder is key. Understanding the basics can guide your decision. In this guide, we explore essential factors to consider. This will help you choose a grinder that fits your needs perfectly.

# Types Of Coffee Grinders

Choosing the right coffee grinder can greatly affect the taste of your coffee. The type of grinder you choose is crucial in determining the quality of your grind. Understanding the different types of coffee grinders will help you make the best choice for your coffee brewing method. [Let’s explore the main types of coffee grinders](https://gomehedi.com/best-burr-coffee-grinder/): blade grinders and burr grinders.

# Blade Grinders

Blade grinders are one of the most common types of coffee grinders. They work by using a rotating blade to chop the coffee beans. This type of grinder is usually more affordable and can be a good option for beginners. Here are some key features:

* **Affordable:** Blade grinders are generally less expensive than burr grinders.
* **Simple design:** Easy to use with straightforward operation.
* **Compact size:** Ideal for small kitchens with limited space.

Blade grinders have some downsides, though. The grind size can be inconsistent, which may affect the taste of your coffee. The heat generated by the blades can also alter the flavor. If you’re just starting and want a budget-friendly option, a blade grinder might be a suitable choice.

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|:-|:-|
|Cost-effective|Inconsistent grind|
|Easy to use|Heat can affect flavor|
|Compact|Limited grind settings|

# Burr Grinders

Burr grinders are favored for their consistency and precision. They crush coffee beans between two grinding discs, known as burrs. These grinders provide a uniform grind size, which is essential for great coffee. Here are some benefits:

1. **Consistent grind:** Burr grinders produce even particles for a better brew.
2. **Adjustable settings:** Easily change the grind size for different brewing methods.
3. **Minimal heat:** Less heat during grinding preserves coffee flavor.

Burr grinders come in two types: flat burr and conical burr. Both offer good grinding performance, but conical [burr grinders](https://gomehedi.com/best-burr-coffee-grinder/) are often quieter and better for home use. The price of burr grinders can be higher, but their benefits often justify the cost. If you’re serious about coffee, investing in a burr grinder might be the right decision.

|Type|Features|
|:-|:-|
|Flat Burr|Precise grind, suitable for espresso|
|Conical Burr|Quiet operation, good for home use|

# Grind Size Matters

Choosing the right coffee grinder can elevate your brewing experience. One key factor to consider is grind size. Grind size affects the flavor, aroma, and strength of your coffee. Understanding this can make a big difference in your daily cup. Let’s explore how grind size matters.

# Coarse Vs Fine

Grind size can range from coarse to fine. Each has its unique characteristics and uses.

A **coarse grind** has larger particles. Think of sea salt. This grind works best for methods requiring longer brewing times.

* French Press
* Cold Brew
* Percolator

A **fine grind** resembles table salt or even flour. This grind extracts flavors quickly.

* Espresso
* Turkish Coffee
* Moka Pot

Using the wrong grind size affects flavor. Too coarse, and your coffee may taste weak. Too fine, and it could be bitter. Below is a simple table to guide you:

|Grind Size|Texture|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Coarse|Sea Salt|French Press, Cold Brew|
|Medium|Sand|Drip Coffee Makers|
|Fine|Table Salt|Espresso, Moka Pot|

# Brewing Methods

Your brewing method determines the ideal grind size. Each method has its own requirements.

**French Press** needs a coarse grind. The metal filter allows some particles through. This results in a full-bodied coffee.

For **drip coffee makers**, use a medium grind. This grind balances extraction time and flavor. It’s the most versatile grind size.

**Espresso machines** require a fine grind. The water passes quickly through the coffee. A fine grind ensures maximum flavor extraction.

**Cold brew** uses a coarse grind. The long steeping time suits larger particles. This results in a smooth, mellow coffee.

Knowing your preferred brewing method helps in choosing the right grinder. It ensures your coffee tastes just right every time.

# Manual Vs Electric

Choosing the right coffee grinder can elevate your coffee experience. The decision often boils down to whether to go manual or electric. Each type of grinder has its own unique set of features and benefits. Understanding these can help you make an informed choice. [Let’s dive into the pros of each to see which suits your lifestyle and coffee brewing needs best.](https://gomehedi.com/best-manual-coffee-grinder/)

# Pros Of Manual

Manual coffee grinders have been a favorite for many coffee enthusiasts. They offer a unique charm and a hands-on approach to grinding coffee. Here are some advantages:

* **Portability:** Manual grinders are usually compact and lightweight. Perfect for travel or outdoor use.
* **Quiet Operation:** They operate quietly, making them ideal for early mornings.
* **Cost-Effective:** Generally, manual grinders are less expensive. They provide great value for money.

Another significant advantage is the **control over the grind size**. With a manual grinder, you can adjust the grind size more precisely. This is essential for different brewing methods. Plus, they are often easy to clean. Let’s compare some features in a table:

|Feature|Manual Grinder|
|:-|:-|
|Power Source|Hand-operated|
|Noise Level|Low|
|Size|Compact|

Manual grinders often have a classic design. They add a traditional touch to your kitchen. If you enjoy the process of making coffee, manual grinders are a great choice.

# Pros Of Electric

Electric coffee grinders are about convenience and speed. They suit those who want their coffee quickly and with minimal effort. Here are some benefits:

* **Speed:** Electric grinders are fast. They can grind a large amount of coffee in seconds.
* **Ease of Use:** Simply press a button and let the machine do the work.
* **Consistency:** Electric grinders often provide a more consistent grind size.

Electric grinders are ideal for those with a busy lifestyle. They help make the morning routine quicker. Many models come with different grind settings. This makes them versatile for various brewing methods. Let’s look at a comparison:

|Feature|Electric Grinder|
|:-|:-|
|Power Source|Electricity|
|Noise Level|Moderate to High|
|Size|Varies (often larger than manual)|

Electric grinders are often equipped with advanced features. These include timers and automatic shut-off. They are perfect for those who value efficiency and ease. If convenience is key, an electric grinder might be your best bet.

# Capacity Considerations

Choosing the right coffee grinder involves several key factors. One important aspect is **capacity considerations**. Capacity refers to how much coffee the grinder can handle at one time. This feature affects how often you need to grind and how fresh your coffee remains. Whether you prefer grinding a single cup or preparing a larger batch, understanding capacity options is crucial for a satisfying coffee experience.

# Single Serve

For those who enjoy a fresh cup of coffee each morning, a **single-serve coffee grinder** is ideal. This type of grinder is perfect for individuals who savor every sip. It allows you to grind just the right amount for one cup, ensuring optimal freshness. Here are some features to consider:

* **Compact Size:** These grinders are small, fitting easily in kitchens with limited space.
* **Quick Grinding:** Grinding a single serving is faster, saving precious morning minutes.
* **Easy Cleaning:** Smaller grinders are easier to clean, preventing stale coffee residue.

Single-serve grinders often include convenient features like grind settings and timers. This ensures you get the perfect grind every time. Below is a simple comparison of features:

|Feature|Benefit|
|:-|:-|
|Size|Space-saving|
|Speed|Fast grinding|
|Maintenance|Easy cleaning|

Choosing a single-serve grinder means less waste and fresher coffee. It’s a great choice for those who value quality and simplicity in their daily brew.

# Batch Grinding

Batch grinding is suitable for **coffee enthusiasts** who often serve multiple cups. This method is perfect for families or offices where several people enjoy coffee. Batch grinders offer larger capacity and robust performance. Here are key points to consider:

* **Large Capacity:** Grind enough beans for several cups at once.
* **Consistent Grind:** Ensures even particle size for balanced flavor.
* **Time Efficiency:** Batch grinding saves time on busy mornings.

Batch grinders come with advanced features like programmable settings and adjustable grind sizes. These options enhance the coffee-making experience. Consider the following table for a quick overview:

|Feature|Benefit|
|:-|:-|
|Capacity|Multiple servings|
|Consistency|Even grind|
|Efficiency|Time-saving|

Opting for a batch grinder is wise for larger households or frequent coffee gatherings. It ensures everyone enjoys fresh and flavorful coffee without constant regrinding.

# Material Quality

Choosing the right coffee grinder is crucial for coffee lovers. The quality of the materials used in a grinder affects its performance and longevity. Understanding the differences in material quality helps you make an informed decision. Your coffee’s taste and your grinder’s lifespan depend significantly on this factor.

# Plastic Vs Metal

The material of a coffee grinder impacts both its performance and durability. Two common materials are plastic and metal. Each has its pros and cons.

**Plastic grinders** are lightweight and often more affordable. They are also less likely to dent if dropped. But, they may not last as long as metal grinders. Plastic can wear down over time, especially with frequent use.

* **Pros of Plastic:**
   * Lightweight
   * Cost-effective
   * Less prone to denting
* **Cons of Plastic:**
   * Less durable over time
   * Can wear out with heavy use

**Metal grinders** are known for their durability. They often provide a more consistent grind and can withstand heavy use. Metal grinders, however, can be heavier and more expensive.

* **Pros of Metal:**
   * Durable and long-lasting
   * Consistent grind quality
* **Cons of Metal:**
   * Heavier
   * More costly

Choosing between plastic and metal depends on your needs. Consider your budget and how often you’ll use the grinder.

# Durability Factors

Durability is a key factor in choosing a coffee grinder. The material quality plays a major role in how long your grinder lasts.

**Key durability factors include:**

1. **Material Type:** Metal grinders generally last longer than plastic ones.
2. **Usage Frequency:** Frequent use wears down grinders faster. Choose a robust material if you grind coffee often.
3. **Maintenance:** Regular cleaning and maintenance extend the grinder’s life. Metal parts may require more care to prevent rust.
4. **Build Quality:** Well-built grinders, regardless of material, tend to last longer. Look for solid construction and reliable brands.

A table comparing durability might help:

|Factor|Plastic|Metal|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Average Lifespan|3-5 years|5-10 years|
|Maintenance Needs|Low|Moderate|
|Resistance to Damage|Less|More|

Consider these factors carefully. They ensure you pick a grinder that suits your needs and lasts long.

# Ease Of Cleaning

When selecting a coffee grinder, ease of cleaning should be a top consideration. Regular cleaning keeps your grinder efficient and your coffee fresh. A clean grinder enhances the flavor and aroma of your coffee. It also prolongs the life of the machine. Understanding the cleaning process can save time and effort. Let’s explore some important aspects of cleaning a coffee grinder.

# Disassembly Features

Disassembling a coffee grinder for cleaning can be daunting. **Easy disassembly** makes cleaning simpler and quicker. Look for grinders with removable parts. These parts often include the hopper, burrs, and grind chamber. If parts snap or twist off easily, cleaning becomes less troublesome.

Some grinders feature tool-free disassembly. This means you don’t need special tools to take them apart. **Ease of disassembly** often correlates with the grinder’s design. A well-designed grinder usually has fewer parts, which simplifies cleaning.

Here’s a quick checklist:

* Are the parts easily removable?
* Do you need tools for disassembly?
* Is there a clear guide or manual?

In some models, disassembly features are listed in the product details. Check user reviews for insights on the disassembly process. **User feedback** can provide valuable information. Compare different models to find one that suits your needs.

# Cleaning Tools

Cleaning tools are essential for maintaining your coffee grinder. Some grinders come with **special brushes** designed for cleaning. These brushes can reach into crevices, removing coffee residues. **Brushes** prevent the buildup of oils that can affect taste.

Grinders with fewer crevices are easier to clean. **Simple designs** often require less frequent cleaning. For regular maintenance, consider these tools:

1. Soft brush: Ideal for dusting off coffee grounds.
2. Microfiber cloth: Great for wiping surfaces without scratches.
3. Compressed air: Useful for blowing out tiny particles.

Some models offer cleaning instructions or guides. These can be found in manuals or online resources. **Follow instructions** to avoid damaging your grinder. A well-maintained grinder ensures a consistent grind and better coffee flavor.

Overall, investing in the right cleaning tools can make a significant difference. Choose a grinder that provides the necessary tools for effective cleaning. **Regular cleaning** enhances performance and extends the lifespan of your coffee grinder.

# Price Range

Choosing the right coffee grinder can elevate your coffee experience. Price is a crucial factor. Coffee grinders come in various price ranges, catering to different budgets and preferences. Understanding these options helps in making an informed decision that aligns with your budget and brewing needs.

# Budget Options

Affordable coffee grinders offer basic features at a lower cost. They are perfect for everyday coffee drinkers who want a reliable grind without breaking the bank. These grinders typically feature:

* Blade grinding mechanism: Simple and effective for coarse grinds.
* Compact design: Fits easily in small spaces.
* Manual operation: Requires no electricity, eco-friendly.

While they may lack advanced features, budget grinders are suitable for drip coffee makers and French presses. Below is a table showcasing common budget coffee grinders:

|Grinder Model|Price|Features|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Model A|$20|Blade grinder, compact|
|Model B|$30|Manual, portable|

For those who enjoy a simple brew, budget grinders are an excellent choice. They offer decent quality at a fraction of the price.

# Premium Choices

Premium coffee grinders boast superior features and quality. They are ideal for coffee enthusiasts who demand precision and versatility. Expect these features in premium grinders:

* Burr grinding mechanism: Consistent grind size, suitable for espresso.

I have been having issues with my manager and boss for a while, but this situation was kind of the last straw for me and I’m not sure what to do. 
Over the weekend, I got diagnosed with strep, and the doctor basically told me to rest and I could go back after 2 days to work. I had a shift over the weekend so I texted my manager and work gc about it and decided to try to get my shift covered. No one in the gc could, and my manager left a message basically saying “I can’t, find coverage yourself.” I went to my boss, she told me to contact my manager about bc she was out-of-town, and so I explained to my boss that I have and that’s why I texted her, which she told me to text my manager again and that she said yo “deal with it” After a lot of back-and-forth, my manager said she could take the shift and that was that. She later texted me late night to see if I could come in and give her the key (I took her key bc I was opening and we don’t make copies of the key) I said yes at first, but then she told me that she could ask someone else to come in instead. Which is when I got mad and sent a text to say no. (I didn’t like that other people weren’t asked first and she decided to ask the sick employee to wake up early to take a key) 
Fast forward to today, we have a maybe unpayed maybe payed 4 hour work meeting. I texted my manager saying I still don’t feel super well and am worried that I’m still contagious, she asked if I could hop on to FaceTime bc the meeting had important information. I want to say no bc I just don’t feel well, but I also don’t want to seem like I am a bad employee. This has been causing me stress for the past 2 days and I need some advice.

Tldr: I am sick with strep and work is asking me to FaceTime and join a 4 hour meeting that may or may not be payed, not sure if I should decline the call and rest or not.",0,1757945052.0,WorkAdvice,1,0.5,False

1nhmpfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1nhmpfn/my_take_on_the_conversation_around_religion/,"My take on the conversation around Religion, Decolonization, and African identity","I think it’s crucial to acknowledge the role colonization played in Africa and how religion was tied to that history. That conversation is important. But I also think the mindset some people push—“don’t practice anything foreign to your ancestors”—has some big gaps, depending on how you apply it.

I fully understand rejecting a denomination or sect of a religion because of its role in colonialism or slavery, or calling out people who practice a white-washed/Arab-washed version that erases African agency. That critique is valid. I even understand wanting nothing to do with said religion as a whole regardless of the denomination/ sect/ theology due to the trauma caused by all the factors mentioned above even if I myself haven’t gone to that conclusion.

But as diasporic Africans (and honestly, the overwhelming majority of this sub falls into that category), we live in the Information Age, shaped by globalism. Every single day we rely on and participate in systems, philosophies, technologies, and cultures that were completely foreign to our ancestors. Including on this very site/app. Cultural exchange is constant. Unlike our more communal ancestors, we interact with a much wider range of people and ideas, because global contact today is on a level that simply didn’t exist to the same extent generations ago.

That’s why I think if your only premise is “don’t practice anything foreign to your ancestral roots,” you risk falling into an endless pitfall. By that logic, you’d also have to reject certain medicine, certain technology, certain political systems, and countless other aspects of daily life that our ancestors didn’t have. I am in no way, shape, or form implying that cultures outside the African world have a monopoly on progress either, as many cultures have been directly influenced by African civilizations and traditions — from Egypt’s advancements in mathematics and medicine, to Ethiopia’s coffee and Ge’ez script, to African art shaping European modernism, and African music forming the backbone of genres like jazz, blues, and hip hop.

It’s not inherently bad to follow a religion, philosophy, or political ideology etc your ancestors didn’t. Religions and ideas have always spread across cultures—Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and others became global precisely because people adopted them outside their original homelands. That doesn’t excuse the violent ways they sometimes spread, especially through colonialism, but it does show that cultural borrowing is nothing new.

I also get why many people emphasize ancestral traditions recently, especially after centuries of suppression, demonization or erasure. That’s incredibly valid and important work. But emphasizing that truth doesn’t mean that choosing something “foreign” is automatically wrong. At the end of the day, what matters is whether it’s meaningful and authentic for you.",2,1757944944.0,Africa,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone,
Let's get real for a second. We've all been there: you're riding a sweet Bitcoin pump, feeling like a genius. Your portfolio is glowing green. Then, in what feels like a blink, a massive red candle erases your gains and then some. Ouch. 😩

The difference between traders who last and those who blow up their accounts isn't a secret indicator or some magic formula. It's boring, disciplined risk management. I know, I know—it's not as sexy as calling the next 100x coin, but it's the single most important skill that will actually make you profitable long-term.
So, grab a coffee, and let's walk through the essential steps for solid Bitcoin risk management. Think of this as the playbook to protect your capital and actually optimize your profits.

Step 1: The Golden Rule - Only Trade What You Can Afford to Set on Fire 🔥
Before you even look at a chart, this is square one. The crypto market, especially Bitcoin, is notoriously volatile. It can swing 10% while you're making dinner.
Because of this, you should never, ever trade with money you need for rent, groceries, or any other life essential. Seriously. This isn't just about being financially responsible; it's about psychology. If you're trading with scared money, you'll make emotional decisions. You'll panic-sell at the bottom and FOMO-buy at the top.
Your trading capital should be money that, if it vanished tomorrow, wouldn't change your life. This lets you trade with a clear head, which is your biggest edge.

Step 2: Master the 1% Rule - Your Portfolio's Shield
This is one of the most powerful rules in trading. The 1% Rule simply means you should never risk more than 1% of your total trading capital on a single trade.
Let's break it down:
If your trading portfolio is $1,000, the absolute most you should be willing to lose on any one trade is $10.
If your portfolio is $5,000, your max risk per trade is $50.
Why is this so effective? It makes it mathematically difficult to blow up your account. Even if you hit a nasty losing streak of 10 trades in a row (it happens!), you've only lost 10% of your capital. You can still recover. If you were risking 10% or 20% per trade, you'd be wiped out after just a few bad calls. This rule keeps you in the game.

Step 3: Use Stop-Losses & Take-Profits Religiously
If you're not setting a stop-loss (SL) and a take-profit (TP) for every trade, you're not trading—you're gambling.
A Stop-Loss (SL) is an automatic order that closes your trade at a specific price if the market moves against you. It's your safety net. It's how you enforce the 1% rule and ensure a small loss doesn't turn into a catastrophic one.
A Take-Profit (TP) is an automatic order that closes your trade when it hits a certain profit target. This locks in your gains and prevents greed from turning a winning trade into a loser.
Don't just place them randomly. Your SL and TP should be based on your strategy, market structure (like support and resistance levels), and your desired risk-to-reward ratio.

Step 4: The Magic of the Risk-to-Reward (R:R) Ratio
This is where it all comes together. The Risk-to-Reward Ratio compares how much you're risking (the distance from your entry to your stop-loss) with how much you stand to gain (the distance from your entry to your take-profit).
You want this ratio to be in your favor. A common minimum target is 1:2, which means you're risking $1 to potentially make $2. A 1:3 ratio is even better.
Think about it:
If you have a 1:3 R:R, you only need to win one out of every four trades to break even. If your win rate is just 30%, you're still nicely profitable! This takes immense pressure off needing to be right all the time. Focus on finding good R:R setups, not on trying to predict the future.

Step 5: Tame Your Emotions - Avoid FOMO and Revenge Trading
Your biggest enemy in trading isn't the market; it's the person staring back at you in the mirror. Two emotions wreck more traders than anything else:
FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Bitcoin is pumping, and you see everyone on Twitter posting massive gains. You jump in at the top without a plan, right before it dumps. Cure: Stick to your strategy. If you missed the move, so be it. Another opportunity will always come.
Revenge Trading: You just took a loss, and you're angry. You immediately jump into another (usually bigger) trade to ""make your money back."" This almost always leads to even bigger losses. Cure: When you take a loss, close the charts. Go for a walk. Detach emotionally. Trading is a game of probabilities, and losses are just part of the business.

Final Thoughts: Putting It All Together
Effective Bitcoin risk management isn't complicated. It's about discipline and consistency. Let's recap the game plan:
Trade with capital you can afford to lose.
Risk only 1% of your portfolio per trade.
Use a Stop-Loss and Take-Profit on EVERY trade.
Only take trades with a favorable Risk-to-Reward Ratio (1:2 or better).
Keep your emotions in check. Stick to your plan.
Follow these steps, and you'll already be ahead of 90% of other retail traders. You'll protect your capital, stay in the game longer, and give your strategy a real chance to be profitable.
Happy trading, and stay safe out there! 🤙

1nhmmb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nhmmb2/reaching_out_to_old_classmates_after_years_is_it/,"Reaching out to old classmates after years, is it acceptable?","**TL;DR:** *Cleaned out Google Photos, got punched in the face by nostalgia. I used to be super social in primary school. High school bullying knocked that out of me. I want to reconnect with a couple old classmates, but the usual next step is often “let’s grab coffee” and that makes me anxious.*

I was clearing storage and fell into old videos from primary school. I forgot how loose I was, loud with friends, goofy, not overthinking. It’s cringe in places, sure, but it’s also kind of sweet. That was me. Then the timeline just drops off. Early high school, things went bad. I got bullied. After that I basically ran on autopilot. The camera roll goes quiet and so did I. I never got back to that same social ease. Not because I stopped caring, but because I stopped trusting that I fit.

Fast forward to now: I do have a few online friends I value a lot, but there’s a tug to check in on people from *before* everything went heavy. There are a couple of old classmates I’m genuinely curious about, plus one friend who reached out to me during high school when she was going through it. Back then I was too in my head to meet her halfway. I’d like to show up better now. I just want to say: “Hey, I remember you. You mattered to me.”

The snag is that if I do reach out and it goes well, the next sentence is almost always, “Let’s get coffee.” I’ve never been a café person. Public indoor meetups make me uncomfortable. I don’t really know the script and I worry about being “on” the whole time. That thought sometimes freezes me before I even type hello. On top of that, I carry this belief that I’m somehow behind people my age, socially, life wise, all of it. Like they’re on Level 30 and I got stuck on Level 12. I worry they’ll clock that immediately. Part of me wonders if I’m just not built for norm. (I’m autistic/anxious; both probably feed into this.)

What I actually want is connection. I want real life friends I can actually meet, because online is good and all, it kept me sane during my toughest times, but it’s not the same when everyone lives miles away.

So here’s what I’m curious about: how would you react if someone from your past reached out after many years? Would you like it? Would you be open to catching up? I’m just trying to gauge if this is an acceptable thing to do or if it comes across as strange. Part of me really wants to try, but I’m still wondering if I even should.",1,1757944756.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1nhmm51,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1nhmm51/ghosted_after_months_of_dating_then_see_their/,"Ghosted after months of dating, then see their nesting partner ... what would you do?","Hey all, I’m new here and looking for some perspective.

I dated someone (29F) for 4–5 months. We went on 12 or more dates, including dinners, concerts, and other outings. I also went with her and her nesting partner to a show and then a bar, spent time in their home, and met some of their friends at their housewarming / her birthday party. At one point, she mentioned planning a summer bike trip. We considered ourselves dating. While I (relationship anarchist/solo poly) was not physically involved with her partner, I was open to KTP and I shared my boundaries and desires clearly throughout our time together.

Things ended when she ghosted me. She had mentioned that she had never been dumped, but I’m starting to suspect that ghosting is her default. That has been upsetting and triggering for me. My last message still hangs unanswered, and even though I didn’t want to continue dating her and have moved on, it is still frustrating and upsetting.

This morning, I went into a café and saw her nesting partner sitting with what I assume is their running club. I considered walking by and saying a quick hi, but even that felt too confrontational or possibly passive-aggressive. Honestly, I just wanted him to notice me, like a silent signal across the room .. yes, I exist! Tell her you saw me! ... without forcing any conversation. I didn’t want to go out of my way, their table was around the corner, and he didn’t see me. That kind of move isn’t really my personality or style. I went into the bathroom, my heart pounding, took a deep breath, and then decided to walk out without coffee or conversation.

I tend to shrink a bit when facing confrontation, though I’ve been working recently on advocating for my needs, so I’m curious how others would have handled this. Would you say hi, ignore it, or do something else entirely? I’m not comfortable involving someone who isn’t part of the dynamic, and above all, I would have hoped for at least a friendship-style exit. How do you navigate such moments when you unexpectedly cross paths with someone connected to an ex in poly dynamics?

But for that to happen I need you to take a moment to be in the moment, soooo grab your favorite cup of tea/coffee, and your coziest sweat shirts because we going to dive in to the rabbit Reddit hole of the term Mom. But before I do I want you all to know that this may be traumatic for some, and that is okay. You don’t have to read anything I’m writing, but I want you to know that those feelings you’re feeling while you sit and scroll are okay to feel. 
My opinions are just that, my own. They come from the experiences I’ve gone through. You can agree,disagree or be neutral, that is okay with me.this Reddit threat is my own journal for word vomit, where no one can judge me or anyone else for wanting to share thoughts that are always on our minds.
Now let’s start with a little back story, I am the youngest in my family, and being the youngest you learn to pick and choose from an early age on how you want your mind to develop, for me, I never had that choice, I had to learn from a young age how to survive. This in clinical terms meant I was always fight,flight or run.my family was broken from the start, due to having a parent who was mentally unstable, but colored my world in greys and blacks for as long as I could remember.i guess you could say I became a young mother, to a mother who wouldn’t be a mother. This in turn made my thinking more mature for my age group, think of iro from avatar in the form of a child’s mind but always walking on the fine edge of insanity. This created a chaos, which in turn created chaotic underdeveloped mind sprinkled with depression and anxiety as a medical cocktail for disaster. 
As I grew with time I had to always be careful with my words and thought because I didn’t want to be abandoned. Like all my siblings, I found out that life sucks. It’s hard and no one is going to save you. This created a child who became jealous, attention seeking and desperate for love. Which in its self was a horrible combination. But don’t worry there is a positive note to this story, which I learned at my 16 year mark of life. I was at my 6th or 7th school over my lifetime and about so many step dads later, I had my first encounter with someone who actually fought for me. What!? It’s true, this one encounter changed my perspective of how my world looked through someone else’s point of view. 
That and anime…lol  I began opening my little cage of bottled up emotions and sought out help for my teenage mind. This act of kindness though was new and scary for me, but I took that chance. And made the choice to really focus on the positives, I smiled more genuinely and made real friends. This created a whole new world, now I am a mom myself. And I want to be open and clear with you about what I learned…
1) you are not your parents.
2) there is absolutely nothing wrong with you.
3)you are not a burden to be passed around or off on people.
4)acting out is not a phase…it’s a cry for help.

People these days will make the choice either their parents made are dangerous or not right. Well that’s not how I was brought up…or my parents were the fun parents. Let me spell something out for you who are reading this, and really listen…your parents are just that…parents. They are people who created you sure but…they are not you. They are examples of what you choose to me, your examples of what parents can and can’t do. Some can be positive and some can be negative. But in the end they are people. I used to blame all my short comings on the way I was brought up, but now being a mom myself I realize that they only created me. I get a choice in who I became and what I did, if your parents were great and you were happy then yay! If they were not then I’m sorry, but in my experience, you need to understand something, you are not your parents. Sure they want the best for you and sometimes they had to make unfair choices. But you as a person are not them. Choice is a double edge sword, as the baboon from the lion king once said, 
As he hit simba with the stick; “ it doesn’t matter, it’s on the past. But it still hurts, ah yes the past can hurt, but you can either run from it…or learn from it.” 
You are not your parents and yes the past will always be that, but you need to understand, there is no one in this world who is perfect. Moms struggle, dads struggle as well. You must choose for yourself who you will be, and teach your little munchkins that life is hard, struggles with always be real, that love is hard and kind. Because those little minds can either create something or destroy something. If you can’t see your child struggle then show them the value of hard work, let them appreciate those thoughts, those feelings. And help them grow. Let them struggle but give them support, each consequence has action. Don’t sugar coat the truth, our children are learning the values of choices. You can either be their friend, or be a parent. But you can not be both. If they have feelings let them feel it. There is no right or wrong way of parenting. If you feel unsafe with your family, cut them out. It people judge you for something let them judge. You created life, some people don’t get the choice, take that and create something strong. I want all my readers to understand this that life isn’t fair, there are actions to your reactions, good and bad. Life doesn’t owe you anything, you chose your life. You can learn from it, or run away from it. What your child chooses to do is their choice, you can give advice you can throw them a bone. But they are free to do what they choose and learn from it.there is no right or wrong, I realized that when I watched my child grow. Felt that little life, so if you are a mom or want to be a mom, or you can’t be a mom know that it’s okay to struggle, it’s okay to have feelings, if you struggle with mental health it’s okay to ask for help. Dads it’s the same thing, there is nothing wrong with being strong or being the bread winner, but learn from your actions parenting is a double edge sword it can protect you or it can destroy you. You are a person with choices. If your child wants to walk away from you because they feel like you don’t understand them, let them go, love them from afar. It will be lonely yes, hand you will ask yourself what you did wrong. Beat yourself up and break down. That’s okay,learn from that. Accept it and move on.because in the end choices make the people. Parents can be good or they can be bad. In the end choices make the life we live.",1,1757944672.0,thoughtsonyourmind,0,1.0,False

Following that, we are travelling to Chile in the coming year where I will be meeting his family officially.

I have tried everything, from different apps, changing all my social media language settings to Spanish, watching cartoons in Spanish, I had a teacher online from Chile (which worked but was very impractical due to time zone differences). I feel as no matter what I do I still have not learnt much, I can have a very basic conversation as to how to order a coffee or ask how is your day, but that is the extent.

TL;DR: I’m probably doing better than most people I know, but I always feel like I’m shit and hate myself too much.

You know those memes about switching between extreme narcissism and extreme self-hate? That’s me.

I was bullied a lot until I was 12, mostly because I traveled a lot and didn’t speak local languages. When my parents moved back to their home country, I finally used my mother tongue to talk to people. I had no friends until high school, where I went to boarding school and was surrounded by people 24/7. I don’t talk to my high school friends anymore. I have some friends in uni, but mostly because others approach me.

I’m dating, but only because my girlfriend initiated it. I spent a while surprised by it like, why would anyone date me? I don’t see myself as good looking, funny, or interesting. I mostly agree to dating because it lets me waste time and avoid being alone with my thoughts. I thought she was pranking me at first.

I’m decently built. People think I’m big, but it’s mostly because others don’t work out or count calories. I’m not that big or lean. I’m 180 cm, 85-95 kg, with abs showing year-round but not bodybuilder lean. I’m smaller and weaker than I want to be. For context, I can deadlift 7 plates, do low incline Smith press 4 plates for reps, and hack squat 6 plates for reps. Lifting keeps me from hurting myself.

I’m not the worst runner I ran a marathon, did cross country and track in high school. I swim, though only started recently this year. However it’s not like I can build myself an interesting personality at the gym.

I’m doing well in uni. My name was on the Wall of Honor last year and probably will be again. But all my classes are easy, and many people just don’t want to study. People who are “friendly” with me usually just want to benefit from me around tests. I give the minimum effort without sounding like an asshole.

I asked my parents, and they just say, “work harder.” I feel like I’ve maxed out all my stats. Both sets of grandparents lived through wars, and their trauma was probably passed down to my parents and me.

I have a shit job as a barista at a specialty coffee store. It’s minimum wage but chill, better than sitting alone at home feeling anxious. I like coffee and making food; it’s one of the few things that give me dopamine. I talk to people at the gym and run club, but I wouldn’t call any of them friends. We spend time together because of circumstances. I’m not really good at anything; most people are just inferior to me.

I can’t fall asleep unless I’m physically exhausted. Even then, I spend time trying to avoid deep thinking. Reading helps, but I risk zoning out into deep thoughts, which defeats the purpose.

Being starved helps me sleep better. When trying to gain weight, sleep gets harder.
At what point do I stop feeling like shit all the time? What’s wrong with me?

Edit: the only reason I get things done is cuz I chose to not miss. I’m very good at forcing myself to do things. I can force myself to do anything. If I let myself be I probably won’t get of the bed in the morning.",1,1757944274.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

I’m an expat in Utrecht province, currently pregnant, and while I have some friends here, I don’t really have a support network for this part of my life. My Dutch is around B1 but I feel more comfortable sharing experiences in English. Sometimes it feels a bit lonely without family around, so it’d be really nice to connect with others in a similar situation…maybe for a coffee, a walk or even just chatting.

I found MamaSocial, but their events are usually in Amsterdam and weekday mornings (which doesn’t work with my job). So if there’s already something in Utrecht, I’d love to know. And if not maybe we can even start a small group ourselves! 💜

Characters are me and my small dog, Wilson.

Chapter 1: Foreshadowing
Tuesday night, 6pm.

Wilson needed a bath. Desperately. The day before had been a muddy mess and his fur had taken the brunt of it. In order to give Wilson a bath at home, I need to do it in the laundry tub - but as Wilson was wiggling around in protest of cleanliness, he kept bumping the hose that comes out of the washing machine, and so was forced to move that out of the way so that I could finish washing the filthy monster. We got it done, and all was forgiven with a duck tendon and a dinosaur toy.

Chapter 2: Choccy Milk
Wednesday night, 7pm.

It had been a long day at work, but still a good day. So when I got home, I took Wilson for a walk and then starting folding the laundry. Wilson was chilling in front of the fire like the croissant he is, I was doing my thing, it was great. So I decided to treat myself - I had a craving for a nice cold cup of choccy milk. Why not? I went to the kitchen and poured myself a big cup of choccy milk, took a couple of sips and then settled back down to fold the second basket of laundry. I stood up and got my clothes to put them in my room, and 30 seconds later, I hear some suspicious noises coming from the lounge room. 
In the 30 seconds I was gone, Wilson had reached up onto the coffee table, and had somehow knocked my cup and spilt the choccy milk. Everywhere. Coffee table? No it's now a lake with streams of milk spilling down the side. Anything that's on the table got a healthy coating of it. My phone got covered. And the rug. Oh the rug. It's thick, soft and luscious... and I watch in slow motion as the milk is slowly absorbed into the fibres.

I ran into the hallway to grab some sacrificial towels, quickly trying to sop up the mess while a string of cuss words left my lips that would have shocked a sailor. I had to hold my leg out to stop Wilson from coming in to ""help"" licking it up, while desperately trying to make a choccy milk disaster into… well just a choccy milk accident. But unbeknownst to me, Wilson had started licking. And licking and licking and licking. I was too absorbed in my efforts, that I didn't realise that Wilson had, in fact, gotten chocolate milk all over himself. I’m talking legs, chest, and somehow the back? I later only realised that small fact when I went to pat him and his fur was... crusty... in the parts he couldn't reach to lick.
I eventually realised I had a carpet cleaner that I could use - I just to learn how to use it...
By the time I was done, it was 9.30 at night. Wilson was happily passed out on the couch, I was having a mourning ceremony for the cup of milk. 
Time for bed, I thought, but the towels I'd initially used for the lake, had since started to smell *rank.* And, knowing the smell would only get worse overnight, I popped them in the washing machine and turned it on. Wilson and I fell asleep to the low rumble of the washing machine working away. Sweet dreams…

Chapter 3: A Need For More Towels
Thursday, 8am.

You know, it's always nice to have a bit of a sleep in. Especially after having to get up so early for my other work shifts (5am). The bed was nice and warm, Wilson was so snugly and cute, all was quiet and well. So relaxing and such a nice way to get up. Everything had been forgiven after the shenanigans of the night before. 
So, we get up and do our usual thing: I go and open up the door to the laundry to let Wilson outside while I get ready... except he's tiptoeing. Why is he tiptoeing? I go to stand on the floor of the laundry, and I was instantly glad that I hadn't put socks on. 
You see, dear reader, herein lies the problem - whoever owned this house before us was a psychopath and thought that putting carpet in the laundry was a good idea. Unfortunately, my parents have never had the time or money to fix this atrocity. So, when I stepped onto the floor in the laundry, it wasn't just wet. My foot sank, bubbles came up, a ring of water appeared around the edges of my feet, and finally, the tell-tale *squish* of a swamp-like carpet. 
My life flashed before my eyes, and that stupid hose floats to the surface of my mind. 
Wilson got kicked outside while I furiously started throwing everything that was on the floor out into non-marsh areas. Bin, laundry basket, detergent, the rice and potato we store in there (we don’t have room anywhere else). It was all thrown with reckless abandon, because even though it may have been like that for 8-9 hours now, there was no way I was letting it sit for a moment longer. And then it was off to the linen closet to get a towel. And another and another. 5 should do, right? I can use the one that's hanging in the laundry. No. 6 was not enough. Within seconds of standing on these folded towels, the water was seeping to the top and bubbling around my feet. I panicked. More towels. The sodden ones got chucked into a dry area to be hung up later, being replaced by towels that got soaked just as fast. 13 towels got used.

Chapter 4: The Aftermath
Monday night, 6pm.

Wilson is perfectly healthy, and didn't get enough of the milk to make him sick - I stopped him before he could make it to the lake and he only licked the milk off his paws. I washed him after I realised his fur was crusty... I think he's still holding a grudge against me for that. 
After 4 days, the carpet is now mostly dry. I’m still not keen to wear socks in there though.
The lounge room doesn’t smell, so I guess I got Lake Choccy Milk out good enough.
I think I’m going to pass on Choccy milks for a while.
And you’ll all be happy to know that the hose is back where it belongs.

TL;DR 
I gave my dog a bath and took the laundry machine hose out of the tub to do so. My dog knocks over a cup of choccy milk, which I clean up but make a mess of some towels. Put towels on to wash overnight, and woke up to flooded carpet floor in the laundry. The floor is mostly dried 4 days later after 13 towels. I have sworn off choccy milk and my dog needed another bath after being covered in milk. 

Note: Wilson didn't get sick from the milk - I stopped him before he got to the lake.

1nhm6bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nhm6bc/divorcing_my_sweet_natured_husband_long_indian/,Divorcing my sweet natured husband. Long Indian drama ahead,"It's a long one. 
I come from a middle class Indian family and so I had what is universally known as arranged marriage. I (32F) and my ex husband (34M) where marriages on January 2022. Before marriage I met with my husband, let's call him Raj, only twice. The first time was in a coffee shop and the second time was when both the family decided to go shopping together. Raj was a very composed man or so he seemed. We talked for long hours everyday since it was Covid period and meeting frequently was difficult. He was a man of every girls dream, he would encourage me for my career and ambition and he would say that together we shall care for both our families. In short Raj gave politically correct answer to all my straight forward questions and so there was no reason to say no. My MIL on the other hand was the sweetest kindest lady, almost too good to be true MIL. Raj had once mentioned that she is a patient of depression but he doesn't allow her to take pills because they are bad for her nerves. 
Anyway fast forward to wedding scenes, MIL kept crying throughout the elaborate 2-day Indian wedding full of various rituals saying everything makes her feel sad and unhappy because she was widowed a year ago and missed her husband. 
It was very difficult to differentiate whether it was a marriage ceremony or a funeral ceremony. On the wedding night my mil was very reluctant to let her son go to his marital bed,  she claimed that her bed feels terribly cold and empty however with the persuasion of relatives on my in -laws side she let her son go but her final statement was "" Today you are getting a new pusssy but do not forget the one that gave birth to you""
Since Indian weddings are long and elaborate I was too tired to process react or comment on the statement from mil. Fast forward to our honeymoon which was very short, only for 2 days because Raj said he cannot leave his mother all alone for too many days. We reached our honeymoon destination and at night my husband receives almost 12 calls from my mother in law between 10 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. and they kept talking ( about God knows what). Needless to say there was no intimate moments between us, not even some personal time to talk to each other and get closer emotionally. The next day it was the same scenario and Raj said that with my father gone forever and me here away from her she feels terribly lonely. 
I have dust allergy which I have not hidden from my ex husband before marriage. One day my mil decides that I need to do all the dusting and cleaning at home despite having a maid. I fell sick after all the work and throughout the night I suffered from asthma attacks and my m i l kept saying that I have brought ill fate to my son by getting him married to a ""defective piece"". Anytime I showed even the smallest gesture of care for my husband my mil never missed to point out that I was married for only 15 days and that my concern could never be as real, true and deep as that of a mother. Once I had forgotten to add salt to curry and the entire bowl of curry was thrown on me and it burnt my skin because it was hot. Raj showed great concern. 
While tending to my wounds he said that I know that my mother is not right always but would you behave in the same  satisfied way if it was your own mother?  Later I learnt that even that concern was because I might go to the police and file a complaint. 
I loved Raj, to the point that I never saw his missing backbone, his inability to take a stand( or shall I say purposely not speaking up for the right thing) I kept making excuses for him. Raj never directly abused me or threaten me up till this point ever. 
There was a time when Raj decided that all three of us should go for vacation and we did there at the hotel my mother in law started throwing a tantrum and calling me all sorts of names and the demeaning me,  Raj seemed clueless regarding  what is happening. Later on Raj spoke to his mother all alone in her room with the door closed and when he came out he said that she was upset because we should have booked one room and all three of us should have slept together. My m i l kept shouting that her bed was cold and empty and we left her all by herself. Raj has quite a few times said things like "" We should all sleep together"", ""we should all three totally have a movie night and sleep together"" but whenever he saw any strange expression on my face he always said that he is saying all this in gest or just suggestion. After coming back it became fairly a regular event that my husband would work till late night and go to sleep with his mother. In the morning if I asked why he didn't come to bed he would say mil woke up and they were chatting and he eventually slept in her bed. And also sometimes made me feel guilty to even think that just because he has a wife now he cannot spen time with his mother.
I went yo visit  my parents for two days, when I came back my saree( the dress that I wore for the reception party, bought by Raj) was gone, all my jewelleries given by my parents were gone, my MIL raided my almirah and took away anything she thought was expensive. When I confronted Raj he sided with her giving weird reasons. 
There are many more incidence which would make this post too long. MIL turns out to be extremely narcissistic, she wanted everything under rr control and the entire world to revolve around her. Anyway fast-forwarding a little bit, uptill this point I was not too vocal about my problems but dynamics started to change between Raj and me when I started to voice my dissatisfaction. When I told Raj that ""whatever is normal and natural according to you, shall we discuss all these problems with our extended family and see what they think?""  Raj lost it. He started calling me names and that I was a very ill behaved person that the society will never accept a woman who leaves her in laws and sits with her parents or divorces her husband. That I had no patience  and never truly loved him and considered his mother as my own. The moment I would say that I am no more harbouring this idea of telling others which includes friends, relatives ,neighbours about what is going on between closed walls he would behave very sweetly and in an understanding way and try to pacify me but whenever I said that I will say everything  to people around me he always paniced and lost his temper and behaved very rudely. Raj also mentioned that they didn't like the gifts my parents gave and that he deserved a substantial amount of "" dowry"". When I said it was illegal he said "" gifts are never illegal"" and he also said if my mother is not oleased with what you bring us from your parents' you might have to endure all these. He also mentioned a couple of times hos reputation is so good in family and at work not a single soul would believe me.
After spending quite sometime there , I realised things are not going to change and now I need to be in charge of my own destiny. So I ordered a hidden cam and a some recorders from Amazon and I started to record stuffs that were happening. Everyday my m i l would throw some kind of temper tension would pick fights with me would call me names insult my mother saying that she is a characterless bitch who slept her way to the position that she is at work and other sorts of nonsense and I would record it. 
While recording all this incidents I was actually waiting for two kinds of events either My greatest hope would come true which is Raj would  get a grip of the situation and realise that all though he loves  his mother a lot but whatever she is doing with his wife is terribly unethical or I would have to use these evidences to come out from this sham of a marriage. Raj would sometimes close the door and remain with his mom in the same room for a long time under the pretext that he is trying to bring her to her senses. However openly Raj never took stand and finally I decided to leave. After going back to my parents home I filed a police complaint with all the evidences and I also filed a case in the court. In the mean time Raj calls me up and says that all the things that I have said are untrue and that I would never be able to prove anything. As suggested by my lawyer I do not speak to him about this. Later on I received a letter from Raj's lawyer and my lawyer talked with his lawyer and I guess my lawyer had showed him some evidence which made his lawyer believe that he was not the Saint that he was claiming to be and that if I pursue the case it would be of great trouble. His lawyer wanted a midway and called my lawyer to ask for any demands we have in exchange of mutual divorce so I basically demanded all the jewellery given by my parents, that were given by my parents and all the other stuff that were ' gifted' to them and the saree that was gifted by ex and taken away by MIL. I also said i need some verbal apologies for what i went through in the presence of lawyers my parents and extended family.
Also my ex said he would never come down to my place ever, it was me who has to bow her head and go back to him. I filed the case in the court closer to my home, and guess who had to came to visit my hometown? Raj ofcourse.... 
And the day we had to last visit the court for the final hearing of the mutual divorce, I wore the same saree that MIL had taken away from my almirah, a few jewellery  given by in-laws( those were with me when i left so MIL could  not take it away and I had so much evidence to ruin her son's career that she never asked to return those, they were happy I have decided to not file another law suit)and posted a selfie later on Facebook.

1nhm4vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nhm4vp/i_divorced_my_very_nice_soft_spoken_husband/,I divorced my very nice soft spoken husband ( Indian drama ahead),"It's a long one. 
I come from a middle class Indian family and so I had what is universally known as arranged marriage. I (32F) and my ex husband (34M) where marriages on January 2022. Before marriage I met with my husband, let's call him Raj, only twice. The first time was in a coffee shop and the second time was when both the family decided to go shopping together. Raj was a very composed man or so he seemed. We talked for long hours everyday since it was Covid period and meeting frequently was difficult. He was a man of every girls dream, he would encourage me for my career and ambition and he would say that together we shall care for both our families. In short Raj gave politically correct answer to all my straight forward questions and so there was no reason to say no. My MIL on the other hand was the sweetest kindest lady, almost too good to be true MIL. Raj had once mentioned that she is a patient of depression but he doesn't allow her to take pills because they are bad for her nerves. 
Anyway fast forward to wedding scenes, MIL kept crying throughout the elaborate 2-day Indian wedding full of various rituals saying everything makes her feel sad and unhappy because she was widowed a year ago and missed her husband. 
It was very difficult to differentiate whether it was a marriage ceremony or a funeral ceremony. On the wedding night my mil was very reluctant to let her son go to his marital bed,  she claimed that her bed feels terribly cold and empty however with the persuasion of relatives on my in -laws side she let her son go but her final statement was "" Today you are getting a new pusssy but do not forget the one that gave birth to you""
Since Indian weddings are long and elaborate I was too tired to process react or comment on the statement from mil. Fast forward to our honeymoon which was very short, only for 2 days because Raj said he cannot leave his mother all alone for too many days. We reached our honeymoon destination and at night my husband receives almost 12 calls from my mother in law between 10 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. and they kept talking ( about God knows what). Needless to say there was no intimate moments between us, not even some personal time to talk to each other and get closer emotionally. The next day it was the same scenario and Raj said that with my father gone forever and me here away from her she feels terribly lonely. 
I have dust allergy which I have not hidden from my ex husband before marriage. One day my mil decides that I need to do all the dusting and cleaning at home despite having a maid. I fell sick after all the work and throughout the night I suffered from asthma attacks and my m i l kept saying that I have brought ill fate to my son by getting him married to a ""defective piece"". Anytime I showed even the smallest gesture of care for my husband my mil never missed to point out that I was married for only 15 days and that my concern could never be as real, true and deep as that of a mother. Once I had forgotten to add salt to curry and the entire bowl of curry was thrown on me and it burnt my skin because it was hot. Raj showed great concern. 
While tending to my wounds he said that I know that my mother is not right always but would you behave in the same  satisfied way if it was your own mother?  Later I learnt that even that concern was because I might go to the police and file a complaint. 
I loved Raj, to the point that I never saw his missing backbone, his inability to take a stand( or shall I say purposely not speaking up for the right thing) I kept making excuses for him. Raj never directly abused me or threaten me up till this point ever. 
There was a time when Raj decided that all three of us should go for vacation and we did there at the hotel my mother in law started throwing a tantrum and calling me all sorts of names and the demeaning me,  Raj seemed clueless regarding  what is happening. Later on Raj spoke to his mother all alone in her room with the door closed and when he came out he said that she was upset because we should have booked one room and all three of us should have slept together. My m i l kept shouting that her bed was cold and empty and we left her all by herself. Raj has quite a few times said things like "" We should all sleep together"", ""we should all three totally have a movie night and sleep together"" but whenever he saw any strange expression on my face he always said that he is saying all this in gest or just suggestion. After coming back it became fairly a regular event that my husband would work till late night and go to sleep with his mother. In the morning if I asked why he didn't come to bed he would say mil woke up and they were chatting and he eventually slept in her bed. And also sometimes made me feel guilty to even think that just because he has a wife now he cannot spen time with his mother.
I went yo visit  my parents for two days, when I came back my saree( the dress that I wore for the reception party, bought by Raj) was gone, all my jewelleries given by my parents were gone, my MIL raided my almirah and took away anything she thought was expensive. When I confronted Raj he sided with her giving weird reasons. 
There are many more incidence which would make this post too long. MIL turns out to be extremely narcissistic, she wanted everything under rr control and the entire world to revolve around her. Anyway fast-forwarding a little bit, uptill this point I was not too vocal about my problems but dynamics started to change between Raj and me when I started to voice my dissatisfaction. When I told Raj that ""whatever is normal and natural according to you, shall we discuss all these problems with our extended family and see what they think?""  Raj lost it. He started calling me names and that I was a very ill behaved person that the society will never accept a woman who leaves her in laws and sits with her parents or divorces her husband. That I had no patience  and never truly loved him and considered his mother as my own. The moment I would say that I am no more harbouring this idea of telling others which includes friends, relatives ,neighbours about what is going on between closed walls he would behave very sweetly and in an understanding way and try to pacify me but whenever I said that I will say everything  to people around me he always panicked and lost his temper and behaved very rudely. Raj also mentioned that they didn't like the gifts my parents gave and that he deserved a substantial amount of "" dowry"". When I said it was illegal he said "" gifts are never illegal"" and he also said if my mother is not oleased with what you bring us from your parents' you might have to endure all these. He also mentioned a couple of times hos reputation is so good in family and at work not a single soul would believe me.
After spending quite sometime there , I realised things are not going to change and now I need to be in charge of my own destiny. So I ordered a hidden cam and a some recorder from Amazon and I started to record stuffs that were happening. Everyday my m i l would throw some kind of temper tension would pick fights with me would call me names insult my mother saying that she is a characterless bitch who slept her way to the position that she is at work and other sorts of nonsense and I would record it. 
While recording all this incidents I was actually waiting for two kinds of events either My greatest hope would come true which is Raj would  get a grip of the situation and realise that all though he loves  his mother a lot but whatever she is doing with his wife is terribly unethical or I would have to use these evidences to come out from this sham of a marriage. Raj would sometimes close the door and remain with his mom in the same room for a long time under the pretext that he is trying to bring her to her senses. However openly Raj never took stand and finally I decided to leave. After going back to my parents home I filed a police complaint with all the evidences and I also filed a case in the court. In the mean time Raj calls me up and says that all the things that I have said are untrue and that I would never be able to prove anything. As suggested by my lawyer I do not speak to him about this. Later on I received a letter from Raj's lawyer and my lawyer talked with his lawyer and I guess my lawyer had showed him some evidence which made his lawyer believe that he was not the Saint that he was claiming to be and that if I pursue the case it would be of great trouble. His lawyer wanted a midway and called my lawyer to ask for any demands we have in exchange of mutual divorce so I basically demanded all the jewellery given by my parents, that were given by my parents and all the other stuff that were ' gifted' to them and the saree that was gifted by ex and taken away by MIL. I also said i need some verbal apologies for what i went through in the presence of lawyers my parents and extended family.
Also my ex said he would never come down to my place ever, it was me who has to bow her head and go back to him. I filed the case in the court closer to my home, and guess who had to came to visit my hometown? Raj ofcourse.... 
And the day we had to last visit the court for the final hearing of the mutual divorce, I wore the same saree that MIL had taken away from my almirah, a few jewellery  given by in-laws( those were with me when i left so MIL could  not take it away and I had so much evidence to ruin her son's career that she never asked to return those, they were happy I have decided to not file another law suit)and posted a selfie later on Facebook.

1nhm2h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nhm2h3/does_camco_tastepure_rv_water_filter_really/,Does Camco Tastepure RV Water Filter Really Deliver? Comprehensive Review You Need,"Camco 40045 RV Water Filter has been my go-to companion for cleaner water during road trips and camping adventures. As an avid RVer, filtering water directly from various sources is non-negotiable. This product's sleek, blue design paired with its straightforward setup makes it a standout accessory for maintaining fresh, safe drinking water on the road. Beyond the aesthetics, I appreciated the portable build, which fits effortlessly into my RV gear stash. It's lightweight at just 1.85 pounds and crafted from durable plastic that withstands the occasional knocks during storage and installation. The patented 6-step filtration is a bold promise, which I was eager to put through its paces.

**Ease of Installation and Functionality**

One thing I adore about this inline water filter is how convenient it is to install. It connects seamlessly to any standard garden or drinking water hose, saving me from last-minute hiccups when getting water ready for coffee or cooking breakfast outdoors. No additional tools required—twist it on, and it’s ready to go. Even during my extended trips, it didn’t feel like an overcomplicated hassle, which is exactly what you'd want when you're away from home comforts. The high water flow promised by the filter's wide-body design is another delight. It felt robust enough to ensure that multiple gallons flowed smoothly, even when washing dishes or showering in the RV. 

**Highlights**

- Advanced 6-step filtration technology reduces chlorine taste and odor.  
- Lead-free certification ensures safe water.  
- Lightweight and portable, designed for convenience.  
- Wide-body design improves water flow during usage.

**Performance and Effectiveness**

I tested the product across different sources—campground faucets, park water systems, and even local garden hoses—and the results were satisfying. There was a significant reduction in unpleasant odors and tastes, often associated with untreated water. Credit goes to the granular activated carbon (GAC) and KDF technology that not only filters out sediments but also controls bacteria and mold when the filter isn't actively in use. The filtration system doesn't just ‘mask’ issues but actually tackles water impurities effectively, making every sip feel pure. This feature became even more valuable on hotter days when hydration is key. 

**Merits**

- Versatility in applications: Perfect for RVs, boats, gardens, and even pet water bowls.  
- Durable plastic ensures longevity in varied weather conditions.  
- GAC technology for exceptional sediment and odor reduction.

**Disadvantages**

- Over time, the flow can reduce slightly as the filter clogs with use.  
- Needs replacement after a period, especially in high usage, which may not appeal to those on tighter budgets.  

**Drawbacks**

- The 20-micron protection, while effective for sediment, may not handle finer impurities compared to some competitors.  
- No indicator for real-time filter status, which leaves you guessing when it's time to replace it.  

**Competing Brands**

When comparing this to other products, like the Culligan RVF-10 water filter, a few strengths and weaknesses become evident. The Camco model offers dual-pack convenience, while Culligan provides a single larger unit. Both perform well for sediment reduction, but Camco excels in portability and ease of use, fitting the RV lifestyle perfectly. On the flipside, a competitor like Clear2O might offer finer filtration for those who want even more precision. However, it doesn’t strike the balance between effectiveness and simplicity the way this one does.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Considering its advanced filtration design and range of applications, I’d say it delivers impressive value. It’s not just an investment in convenience but health as well. Similar products in the market are priced within a comparable range, but the fact this is a 2-pack gives it an edge in terms of longevity and financial efficiency. The build quality and U.S. craftsmanship reassure you that you're not compromising quality over cost, which is a refreshing change in today’s disposable consumer market. Overall, water filtration is one area where skimping is just not an option, and this product ensures you won't have to.

I have been before, with my kids last May where we stayed at Club Med (I was solo traveling with kids) and a couple years ago where I stayed at Atelier.

We are struggling to decide what AI to stay at.

Priorities:
Nice beach (prefer not to have it open to the public)
Safe
Good pools that won’t be over packed with people
Club level
Good food and service
Transport available to and from the resort

Things we don’t care about:
Sharing a bed
Family or adults only

Things we don’t want:
To feel pressured into buying a time share
To feel like we are at a daycare
To never get a chair by the pool due to chair savers
A huge party vibe (don’t want to feel like we are on spring break) 

Things we like in general/the vibe:
Coffee
Craft cocktails
Snorkeling
Shows/entertainment
Relaxing by the pool and drinking cocktails

I really loved Atelier, but don’t want to spend club (Inspira) level at Atelier money. The food and shows were great, good service, and it felt super safe.

I was way less in love with Club Med. We stayed in club level (Jade) and we loved that we were pretty much the only people in the private Jade pool, as I think I was the only person in that part of the resort with kids. I didn’t feel like they had a lot of drink options and never managed to catch a buzz. The food was meh, I was sick for two weeks after getting back.

Budget for four nights would be $2000-$3000 (not including flights(.

In the past week, I was having issues of liquid collecting in between that inner piece and the underside of the lid with handle when traveling with it in my backpack. When I would remove the lid to enjoy my coffee, liquid would start dripping from one of the two small openings found on the screw part of the lid.

I have since realized the inner piece was not sitting flush within the inner part of the lid and that was most likely the culprit of liquid collecting in between the two pieces.

I scuffed up the edges of the inner piece removing it with a flat head screwdriver as I wanted to clean out any liquid that had collected in between it and the lid. It does have a rubber gasket around it that should give it a good leak-proof seal.

So, two questions:

What is the purpose of the inner piece? It doesn't seem necessary.

Is there an easier way to remove it in case I need to again clean out liquid that has collected?

I know everyone's body reacts differently to medication but I wondered for you personally, what dose meant relief from anxiety whilst still feeling relatively awake?

I am considering trying a smaller dose but wanted to hear some anecdotes from people first. P.S I completely realize that I may react very differently to other people but it helps to know others' experiences anyway.

I am also very slim so I wonder if that increases the drowsy impact as 25 mg dose is a higher concentration for me per kg of body weight, compared to someone heavier.

Described as versatile and travel-friendly, I had high hopes for its performance, and while it met my expectations in some areas, a few aspects left room for improvement.

**Compact Design Meets Convenience**  
This coffee maker strikes a balance between functionality and saving space. Its less-than-5.1-inch width makes it perfect for cramped countertops or smaller kitchens. It’s sleek and doesn’t look out of place even in a workspace or dorm room. The black finish and stainless steel accents give it a modern, minimalistic vibe. I moved it between my kitchen and work desk a couple of times with no issues—it’s lightweight and portable enough to carry, weighing just over five pounds.

**Impressive Brewing Flexibility**  
Its standout feature, in my opinion, is its three-in-one brewing function. The machine supports K-cup pods, ground coffee, and even tea brewing—something I took full advantage of. Having the two adaptors and a reusable capsule included feels both economical and eco-friendly since I didn’t have to buy extras. On days I needed a quick caffeine fix, popping in a K-cup was a breeze. Other mornings, I found myself using freshly ground coffee, and the flavor was rich every time. I even experimented with loose-leaf teas, which brewed evenly, much to my surprise.

[Check KIDISLE CM9429D price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b0dhclg55h/)

**Travel Mug Friendly Design**  
One of the handiest perks for me was its travel mug-friendly design. The drip tray is removable, easily accommodating mugs up to 7.2 inches tall. For someone constantly on the go, the ability to brew directly into a travel mug saved me time every single morning. It even comes with a stainless steel thermal travel mug, which kept my coffee warm longer than expected. I liked the convenience of having everything ready to hit the road.

**Variety of Brew Sizes**  
Not everyone wants the same amount of coffee every time, and the option for five cup sizes (6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 ounces) offers great customization. Whether you’re someone like me who needs a small cup in the evening or a jumbo-sized drink in the morning, it’s nice not to be locked into just one or two brew options. I tested them all, and the machine consistently brewed faster than I anticipated. However, brewing larger volumes did slow down the process slightly.

**Self-Cleaning Feature: A Lifesaver**  
Cleaning coffee makers is a chore, but this one has a self-cleaning option that, in my testing, worked as advertised. Pressing and holding both the “SIZE” and “BREW” buttons activates the function, making maintenance practically hassle-free. I noticed after using this every two months (as recommended), there wasn’t any residual clogging in the machine.

**Highlights**  
• Compact and stylish design that fits small spaces  
• Three-in-one brewing compatibility: K-cups, coffee grounds, and tea  
• Travel mug friendly with an included thermal mug  
• Flexible brew sizes for personalized options  
• Easy-to-use self-cleaning feature  

**Areas of Concern**  
• The brewing noise was a bit louder than I expected for such a compact machine, especially during the larger size selections.  
• While versatile, I found a tiny learning curve when switching between pod and ground coffee options; the instructions could have been clearer.  
• The coffee temperature, though solid for everyday use, wasn’t as piping hot as some competitors’ models, like those from Keurig.  

**Direct Competitors**  
I’ve previously used a Keurig single-serve coffee maker and a similar model from Hamilton Beach, so naturally, I compared the KIDISLE CM9429D to these. The Keurig felt more polished with quieter operation and better temperature control, but it doesn’t come with a self-cleaning function—something I’ve come to appreciate. Meanwhile, Hamilton Beach models offered strong performance with ground coffee but lacked a thermal mug included with the purchase. For value and versatility, the KIDISLE machine sits comfortably in the middle of the pack, making it a practical choice for budget-conscious buyers looking for a well-rounded performer.

**Smart Spending**  
Being competitively priced for a coffee maker with this range of functionality, it’s hard to argue against its value. The reusable filter alone will save costs on disposable pods over time. If you need a simple, compact coffee maker that doesn’t compromise on versatility, it offers solid features at a reasonable investment compared to other more expensive models.

Mint Tea Drama

Tajine kefta in Casablanca,
Spices dancing in Setti Fatma,
In Ouarzazate, at once we knew,
The desert called,
The sky turned blue

Sleeping outside, in the Sahara,
Berbers sing, when it gets darker,
They sing of sand, and of the martyrs,
And other tales,
Of mint tea dramas

Climb The Atlas,
Out of the valley,
Offered blueberries from a family
Palm trees sway, and elders pray,
Where women work, their children play 

Through olives groves,
Where secrets sleep 
Another tea, it's getting steep 
Willows weep, natures embrace 
The berbers land,
A happy place

Sharing drinks, with the snake charmer,
Another sale, Another barter
Boys carve wood, 
Just like their fathers
On the road,
Of mint tea drama

Mountain trecks an coffee breaks 
Where mules get tired, from the weight
Another stop, to take the taste
Of green leaved tea,
Sugar laced

Moroccan Whiskey from the street vendor,
Dattes an figues, before it gets darker
Another sugar, into the green leaved wonder,
Another taste,
Of mint tea drama

Kasbahs and schools, and dried acacia,
One big oasis,
All around ya
Another cup, Another saga,
Another taste, of mint tea drama",1,1757942744.0,Morocco,1,1.0,False

1nhlqgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedTech/comments/1nhlqgd/explore_if_the_best_stereo_receiver_yamaha_rs202/,Explore if the Best Stereo Receiver Yamaha R-S202 Delivers on Sound,"Yamaha’s R-S202 caught my eye with its promise of superior sound quality wrapped in a sleek, minimalistic design. As someone who appreciates great audio, I was eager to give this stereo receiver a spin and see how it would perform in daily use. This receiver has a solid reputation, but no product is perfect. Here’s my assessment after weeks of putting it through its paces.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The brushed aluminum finish on the Yamaha R-S202 is tastefully subtle, exuding a classic aesthetic that fits seamlessly with most home setups. I loved the uncluttered design — no overwhelming number of buttons or flashy lights, just a simple, clean layout. On one occasion, my neighbor commented while visiting, ""This looks much more expensive than it probably is,"" and honestly, I couldn’t disagree. Despite the reasonable weight of 18.5 pounds, installing it was fairly straightforward. However, lifting it required a bit of care, especially if you're working solo. The headphone terminal and speaker selector for two systems are conveniently positioned, making it feel genuinely user-friendly.

**Performance and Sound Quality**  
I have to hand it to Yamaha — their claim of ""natural sound"" isn’t just fancy marketing. The R-S202 delivers rich, room-filling audio that’s pleasantly free of distortion even at higher volumes. During movie nights, this receiver powered through explosive action scenes and soft dialogue effortlessly. I paired it with my bookshelf speakers, using the included H&A 16 AWG Speaker Wire Cable, and was blown away by how clean and balanced everything sounded. Even older vinyl records had a warmth I didn’t expect to enjoy this much. It’s impressive that it outputs 100W per channel, which feels like overkill in the best way for my modest living room.

[Find out if Yamaha R-S202 is on sale at Amazon.](https://soundcontroltech.com/p/b0cqpp2cqh/)  

**Ease of Connectivity**  
Bluetooth integration makes a world of difference. Streaming from Spotify or YouTube Music on my phone was a breeze. The pairing process is straightforward — it took less than 30 seconds to get my device connected. This feature has been particularly handy for playing background music during gatherings. Some receivers complicate connectivity, but Yamaha kept it simple here. Nevertheless, if you’re someone still relying on dedicated CD players or other legacy systems, the receiver’s inputs accommodate those without any fuss.

**40 Preset FM/AM Stations**  
This feature brought back some nostalgia. It’s rare these days to find people tuning into actual radio, but I couldn’t resist trying it out. Setting presets for my favorite local jazz and classic rock stations was simple. There's a certain charm in flipping through stations using the remote while sipping coffee on a lazy weekend morning. For radio lovers — whether you're die-hard or casual — it’s refreshing to see a newer product deliver such excellent signal clarity.

**Merits**  
- Clean, balanced sound output with high power  
- Seamless Bluetooth pairing  
- Minimalistic and premium-looking brushed aluminum finish  
- 40-station FM/AM memory for easy access  
- Convenient speaker selector for two systems  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The remote control feels a bit cheap compared to the receiver's overall premium vibe  
- Lack of optical or HDMI inputs limits its versatility for advanced systems  
- Bluetooth range and connectivity experience minor hiccups if large objects block the signal  

**Competing Products**  
This stereo receiver sits in a category with some notable competitors like the Sony STR-DH190 and the Denon PMA-600NE. While the Sony model aligns closely in price, its build quality doesn’t quite match Yamaha's sophistication. However, Sony wins with slightly more robust Bluetooth stability in busy households. The Denon, on the other hand, stands out for its inclusion of a subwoofer pre-out, which sets it apart. But with Denon, you’re looking at a higher price tag, and the unit doesn’t have Yamaha's same polished flare or FM/AM functionality.

**Quality for Price**  
Considering the features and Yamaha's legacy reputation for Hi-Fi systems, the R-S202 is incredibly cost-effective. Sure, the absence of some modern inputs like optical jacks may seem limiting for certain users. Still, for someone looking for high-quality sound, robust Bluetooth, and a stylish design, it stands out as a smart budget-friendly choice in its category. Instead of cramming unnecessary bells and whistles, it focuses on delivering superb audio, which should really be the primary concern in a stereo receiver.

1nhlpvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuperDrinks/comments/1nhlpvm/the_future_of_indian_beverages_from_traditional/,The Future of Indian Beverages: From Traditional Flavors to Modern Innovations,"# Introduction

India has always been a land of beverages. From the steaming cups of chai in every household to refreshing glasses of lassi and buttermilk in the summer, drinks have been a part of daily life and social culture for centuries. But in the 21st century, the **Indian beverage industry is undergoing a massive transformation**. Global influences, changing consumer preferences, and technological innovations are reshaping what people drink and why they drink it. This article explores how **traditional flavors are being reimagined with modern innovations**, what trends are driving the future of beverages in India, and how brands like [**V Super Drinks**](https://superdrinks.in/) are leading this exciting revolution.

# The Roots: Traditional Indian Beverages

India’s beverage history is rich and diverse. Popular traditional drinks include:

* **Chai (Tea)** – With endless variations across regions.
* **Lassi & Buttermilk** – Yogurt-based drinks that cool and aid digestion.
* **Nimbu Pani (Lemon Water)** – A classic refresher with salt, sugar, and spices.
* **Sharbat** – Sweet, fruit-based summer coolers.
* **Herbal Concoctions** – Ayurvedic drinks with turmeric, tulsi, ginger, and amla.

These beverages are deeply rooted in culture, family traditions, and health wisdom passed down generations. But modern lifestyles demand **convenience, portability, and innovation**

# The Shift: From Kitchens to Bottles

The rise of packaged and ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages has brought traditional drinks into modern formats:

* Chai lattes in bottled or café versions.
* Packaged lassi and buttermilk for urban consumers.
* Herbal teas infused with superfoods.
* Ready-to-drink lemonades with clean labels.  

This transition ensures traditional flavors stay relevant for younger generations who prefer **on-the-go solutions** without losing the essence of Indian culture.

# Global Influences on Indian Beverages

Urban India is increasingly exposed to global wellness and lifestyle trends. This has influenced beverages in several ways:

1. **Protein Drinks** – Inspired by global fitness culture.
2. **Cold Brew & Specialty Coffees** – Driven by café culture.
3. **Plant-Based Drinks** – Almond, soy, and oat milk gaining traction.
4. **Functional Beverages** – Energy boosters, immunity drinks, and probiotic shots.

Global flavors are merging with Indian tastes, creating a **fusion beverage culture**.

# Modern Innovations in Indian Beverages

The future of beverages lies in **innovation at every level**—from ingredients to packaging:

* **Functional Ingredients**: Turmeric, moringa, ashwagandha, and giloy infused into modern drinks.
* **Low-Sugar Alternatives**: Using stevia, honey, or fruit-based sweeteners.
* **Exotic Flavors**: Lychee, peach, blueberry, and pomegranate blended with traditional bases.
* **Smart Packaging**: Eco-friendly bottles, resealable packs, and QR codes for transparency.
* **Personalization**: Tech-driven customization where drinks align with fitness goals and nutrition needs.

These innovations appeal to youth who seek both **health and aspirational lifestyles.**

# Case Study: Coconut Water Reinvented

Coconut water has always been a street-side refreshment in India. But modern brands are elevating it by:

* Offering **flavored variants** (coconut-lychee, coconut-peach, coconut-orange).
* Using **clean labels** with no artificial additives.
* Marketing coconut water as a **sports drink alternative** with natural electrolytes.

This reinvention ensures a traditional favorite stays trendy in the wellness-driven beverage landscape.

# Protein Milkshakes: Tradition Meets Innovation

Milk has always been part of Indian households, but modern consumers demand more functionality. Protein milkshakes are the answer:

* Combining the nutrition of milk with the strength of protein.
* Packaged in convenient bottles for gyms, offices, and travel.
* Flavored for indulgence without guilt.

This innovation connects the **old (milk culture)** with the **new (fitness and convenience).**

# Tech & Beverages: The Digital Connection

Technology is shaping the beverage industry in exciting ways:

* **AI-powered recommendations** for personalized hydration.
* **Fitness app integrations** linking beverages to nutrition plans
* **AR packaging experiences** that tell brand stories.
* **E-commerce platforms** making beverages accessible nationwide.

The future will see consumers engaging with beverages not just as products but as **digital lifestyle companions.**

# The Sustainability Factor

Today’s youth are not just health-conscious—they are eco-conscious. Sustainability in beverages includes:

* Using **biodegradable or recyclable packaging**.
* Sourcing ingredients ethically.
* Reducing carbon footprint in production and distribution.

Brands that combine innovation with sustainability will earn the trust of the next generation.

# The Role of V Super Drinks

[V Super Drinks](https://superdrinks) represents this blend of **tradition and modernity** by:

* Offering [**protein milkshakes**](https://superdrinks.in/milkshakes/) that bring nutrition into everyday life.
* Reinventing [**coconut water**](https://superdrinks.in/juices/) with refreshing, innovative flavors.
* Ensuring **clean labels** that build transparency and trust.
* Designing beverages that are both **functional and aspirational.**

Through this, the brand not only participates in the future of beverages—it helps **define it.**



**Conclusion**

The future of Indian beverages is bright, dynamic, and deeply connected to both heritage and innovation. Traditional drinks like chai, lassi, and coconut water will continue to thrive, but in modern avatars that suit busy lifestyles. **Functional, clean-label, and sustainable innovations** will dominate, and consumers will increasingly choose drinks that align with their values and aspirations.

Brands like V Super Drinks are at the forefront of this transformation, ensuring that the Indian beverage story continues to evolve—deliciously, responsibly, and innovatively.

Hey everyone, I've been applying to jobs at Starbucks recently, but I keep getting stuck after answering their set of application questions—I never seem to get called for an interview. This is my first time applying to Starbucks, but I do have customer service experience in a related setting, so I’m not sure what I might be doing wrong. I’m wondering if I’m answering the questions incorrectly or if there's something else I should be doing.
Any advice or insight would be really appreciated. Thanks so much in advance

These are the questions

“1. Why do you want to work at Starbucks?

I want to work at Starbucks because I really enjoy working in customer service and creating positive experiences for people. I know Starbucks is more than just a coffee shop; it’s a welcoming place where customers feel part of a community. I’d love to be part of that, building connections with customers, working as a team with partners, and contributing to that friendly and efficient service environment.

2. What does great customer service look like to you?

To me, great customer service is about more than getting the order right. It’s about being friendly, approachable, and creating a welcoming atmosphere for every customer. That could be as simple as remembering a regular’s usual drink, asking about their day, or making sure new customers feel comfortable with the menu. It’s about being attentive, fast, and consistent, while also adding those personal touches that make people want to come back.

3. Tell me about your favourite customer and how you built a relationship with them. How did you build that connection?

My favourite customer when I worked at second cup was Leah who later became one of my best friends. At first, I built the connection by greeting her warmly and asking about her day or her classes when she came in for coffee. One day, I noticed her bright yellow Hydro Flask covered in stickers and realized I had seen it before in one of my psychology classes. I asked her if she was in that class, and that sparked more conversation. From then on, we connected more each time she came in. That experience showed me how noticing small details and showing genuine interest can really strengthen customer relationships.”",2,1757942374.0,starbucksbaristas,2,1.0,False

I'm 26 years old and I still don't have a college degree. I've been a part time student for 5 years; still no degree cause I do the minimum. I'm skinny fat. I have to pound an iced coffee every 4 hours because if I don't I can't focus cause I'm exhausted from browsing YouTube/Reddit/Porn and playing video games until 3AM every night. The first thing I do when I wake up is check my Facebook/Instagram feed. Then suddenly it's late and I have to rush to work. I do the bare minimum at work to not get fired because that's all my attention span allows me to do. When I was with my ex girlfriend, half the time I'd rather jack off to porn than have sex with her.

Few months ago, I read here about a quiz ([stopsocial](https://stopsocial.today/)) that calculates how much lifetime you’re losing to social media. I got my result, and I felt sick. It told me I lost 2 years and was on track to waste nearly 8 more. That was the moment that pushed me to start journaling digitally right inside the app because it was easier than starting on paper. That single wake-up call was a turning point for me.

Now my free time will is spent working out, cooking, hanging out with my dog (whom I feel I have been emotionally neglecting), learning to play bass guitar, etc.

You might think it's extreme but I can't go on like this. I'd rather die. I've already wasted all my teens and most of my 20s to this addiction and I've decided I can't let it take any more.",6,1757942262.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

I said let’s take the day. We’re both don’t have anything to do let’s do something together. She said that she wanted to spend the day by herself and work on her book at the library. She goes to the library a lot, but I still felt like this was odd. Then she proceeded to get very dressed up and put on a lot of makeup her phone was sitting in the hallway and I saw a message Flash from a man I didn’t recognize The message said “I will be waiting for you in bed  ring me a coffee please”. My blood boiled over and I confronted her about it she lied at first and said she’s going to the library. She lied for a good 30 minutes then she finally admitted that yes she’s going to meet a man and proceeded to go on a date anyway and she was away for four hours. I don’t know what Happened. I’m kicking myself because I wish I had opened her phone and read all the messages and then just waited for her to get home and confront her afterwards because then she would be more accountable for what she’s done because now she’s playing all innocent like she didn’t do anything because she told me that she came clean with this man and told him she was married and cannot be with him, but they were gone for four hours, so what do I know. I actually believe her when she said that they just went for a walk because she’s usually very trustworthy. How can I get rid of this constant feeling that I did the wrong thing that I should’ve been stronger and just let her walk out the door? Later, she told me that she met him on an online dating app and that he lived far away and flew here to see her help me please I’m torturing inside.

Alright friends, let’s talk about something juicy that’s been buzzing around the web lately – faceless content creation! 😎 Have you noticed how some of the most popular channels and accounts are thriving without ever revealing a face? Crazy, right? 

I mean, who would have thought that you could build an empire (or at least a solid side hustle) without stepping in front of a camera? It’s like magic! 🎩✨ 

So, why is this a game changer? Here are a few mind-blowing points:

- **Anonymity is Freedom**: Ever feel like you just can’t be yourself on camera? Faceless content lets you express your ideas without worrying about your hairstyle or that pimple!
  
- **Higher Engagement**: Sometimes, a voice narrating a story or a slick animation can catch attention better than a talking head. Think about it—would you rather watch someone explain a tutorial or see a cool animated character doing it?

- **Scalability**: Imagine creating reams of content and never having to change out of your pajamas. 🙌 With tools and platforms available today, it’s totally possible. You can focus on content strategy rather than stressing over production. 

But hold up, before you jump on the faceless bandwagon, here’s a little guide I found super helpful in maximizing this approach: [Check it out!](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/). Trust me, it’ll turn your faceless journey into a well-oiled content machine!

**Now, let's break it down further:**

1. **Niche Focus**: What do you love? Animals? Cooking? Finance? There’s an audience out there for everything! Find your passion and run with it.

2. **Quality Content**: Invest some time into making your quotes, memes, or animations punchy. No one loves a blurry image!

3. **Leverage Tools**: There are so many great tools out there that can help! From voiceovers to stock videos, don’t let a lack of resources hold you back.

4. **Build a Brand**: Develop a consistent look and feel that reflects your content. Whether it’s colors, fonts, or themes—people love familiarity.

5. **Community Connection**: Just because you’re faceless doesn’t mean you can’t be personal! Engage with your audience authentically. Respond to comments, maybe even host a Q&A with an avatar or fun animations!

Isn’t it wild to think that behind every successful channel, there might be someone sipping coffee in their backyard? ☕ So, before you turn on that webcam and stress over lighting setups, maybe it’s time to embrace the faceless revolution. 

Let’s be real—do you really want to invest all that time perfecting your look when you could be spinning out incredible content instead? 🤷‍♂️

I’m excited to hear what you all think about this trend. Are you considering joining the faceless movement, or do you think showing your face is still the way to go? Let's keep the convo rolling!",1,1757942053.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Super automatic machines usually run much higher, but the Philips 2200 has dropped to $399.99 and feels like one of the better picks if you want café style coffee at home without a steep price tag.

**Worth noting**

* Fully automatic system with intuitive touch display for easy brewing
* Two coffee options: espresso or regular coffee
* Classic milk frother adds cappuccinos and lattes to the mix
* 100% ceramic grinder for consistent grind and durability
* Aroma seal keeps beans fresher for longer
* AquaClean filter reduces descaling needs, plus descaling alert built in
* Removable brew group for quick cleaning and maintenance

**Why it’s being highlighted**  
You’re getting features normally seen in pricier models like a ceramic grinder, milk frother, and automatic cleaning system, all at a mid range price. It’s positioned well for anyone who wants convenience and quality in one unit.

1nhlgp1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhlgp1,Has anyone had a false positive THIS dark?,"
How many false positive urine tests have you received? Have you ever had a false negative blood HCG? 

Any idea what could have happened in my situation to cause multiple positive home tests (purchased from different stores) but a blood test <1 HCG, lots of symptoms, and light bleeding post tubal ligation. I am thinking it was a chemical pregnancy. 

I just had my 3rd baby in March (I have a 4 year old, 2 year old, and 5 month old). I am breastfeeding and haven’t had my period yet (for me it tends to return at 12 months post partum.) I chose to have a tubal ligation in May since we didn’t intend to have more kids and to decrease my risk of cancer given my family history. 

For about 1-1.5 weeks at the end of August, I was experiencing definitive pregnancy symptoms that I had with all 3 of my kids. 

Then last Friday 9/5 I bled after intercourse (I don’t usually bleed). Then Saturday morning my pregnancy symptoms were undeniable so I took a test and it was instantly positive (photo attached).I went to the ER since it was a weekend and my husband and I were concerned it was ectopic in light of a tubal ligation. My HCG at the hospital was <1. They said it must be a false positive urine test and sent me home.

Sunday morning I had another positive test but the line was much lighter. By the following day my symptoms were subsiding.

I moved on, chocked it up to a weird series of events. My therapist (I have PPD/PPA) insisted I message my doctor to clarify the details (since we never had a discussion about all details) and make sure there isn’t a risk that it was a chemical ectopic and product was left behind…given that this was 3 months after my tubes were removed. So, I messaged my doctor. Her response essentially said that “You had false positives, your brain imagined a pregnancy, you imagined the symptoms, the bloodwork was <1 HCG, dont ask me about this again.” 

I do have anxiety but I’m not nuts! This is the same doctor who did my tubal ligation 3 months ago so I think that she would rather tell me I’m crazy than consider the fact that there may be an error with her surgery. I know human error can impact blood results, and I personally had doctors, from a fertility clinic no less, call me up and say that their lab mistakenly switched patient vials and we have to get new blood work done. So I know it’s possible that a mistake could happen.

The more I think about it, the more it seems too coincidental. My symptoms were real, i was bloated, peeing all night long, nauseous (anything triggered me—I couldn’t feed my dogs, drink coffee, smell a towel that hung in the bathroom for a day after my husband used it (that was my first pregnancy symptom with my last kid), insatiable appetite, craving salty French fries and mass amounts of protein, exhausted by 8 pm, falling asleep doing my kids bedtime, fatigue during the day, insomnia randomly at night, etc. Even my Apple Watch data change from mid August onward (HRV decreased and steadied out). These were all things I experienced with my other pregnancies as well. 

Since I had my tubal, I didn’t think I could get pregnant. I had no reason to assume I would be pregnant and imagine these symptoms. It was only when the symptoms were so undeniable that I took the test. I truly felt pregnant. I don’t even want to try to have a conversation with my doctor about it out of fear she will say I’m crazy but I really do think I had a chemical pregnancy and something must have failed with my tubal ligation. 

How many false positive urine tests have you received? Have you ever had a false negative blood HCG? Am I over analyzing this and my doctor is right, it was just a bunch of false positive tests purchased from different stores? ",3,1757941906.0,lineporn,8,1.0,False

🚶‍♀️ Wander the old lanes, bazaars, and monuments.
📸 Capture some candid moments in the heart of Delhi.

1nhlglm,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1nhlglm/should_i_apologize_if_my_joke_triggered_someone/,"Should I apologize if my joke triggered someone I'm dating, even though the trigger was wildly misplaced?","I have been on two dates with a girl. We both have a lot of childhood trauma - I've been in therapy for a while and am actively working on my stuff, while she hasn't.

The other day, I made a wildly sarcastic joke to her over text. 

She said something to the effect of: ""English is weird, flammable and inflammable means the same thing""

I responded: ""Yes, English is inferior compared to the great revival of the Chinese civilization <insert funny sticker of a well known Chinese political leader""

**I clowned on Chinese nationalist rhetoric quite a bit on the first date, and she is 100% in agreement with me here as it pertains to the actual political issues, and I am quite certain her response has nothing to do with Chinese politics***

She also knows that I read very widely in English, attend a book club, and that I quite love the English language. But she got really upset and responded

""Did you just mock my favourite language?"" (She's referring to English here, she loves to read and write), and demanded an apology.* 

I sent a sad cat sticker because I was genuinely under the impression that she was just joking around.

""Ded, are you the kind of person who never apologises? Go away. I was going to say <ongoing sexual flirty remark we've been saying to one another>, but not anymore. Goodbye""**

I replied ""wait, are you actually hurt?"" and I was genuinely still dumbfounded by this point.**

She returned an hour of silence later to say ""it's ok. i believe in freedom of expression."", went silent again, and 2 hours later returned to clarify that it's about how I would feel if she had ""gone against something I liked"", like for example if said she hated coffee (since I loved coffee).**

I replied truthfully that I would not mind, not even a little bit, whether other people liked coffee or not, and clarified that regardless, I really really did not hate the English language or desire to ""go against"" anything.

She went on to react to my response with a heart emoji, sweep the entire altercation under the rug with cutesy cat stickers and pretended like nothing happened.

From my perspective, her reaction was way out of proportion, and was a sign of her own deep emotional wounds being triggered. 

I am usually on the side of ""impact, not intent"" and would apologize if, say, a slightly edgy joke rubbed someone the wrong way, even if I believed that's more of their own response rather than the doing of my joke itself. I believe in repairing relationships and not being dismissive when someone is hurt.

In this case, however, it felt like her response necessarily meant that she interpreted my comment in the *complete opposite* of what was being said. I am fairly certain a random sample of 1000 people reading it would correctly decode as a joke, even without further context about me. It feels wrong to apologise for something I didn't actually mean in the way she took it. It feels like over-owning and reinforces a pattern where I'm responsible for other people's dysregulation. I've been working against my tendency to people-please to keep the peace, and apologising here seems like a wild violation of these principles.

Furthermore, I also think if I genuinely believed say, Japanese, is a superior language to English, is that not an acceptable opinion to hold or state?

If she had said ""I read that as you mocking my favourite language and that hurt"", I would have said genuinely and kindly ""I never want you to feel that way, help me understand..."".

If she had said ""Oh God, I don't even know what touched such a raw nerve here for me, my bad"", it would have been an incredible green flag and a turn on for me for someone in trauma recover.

But her aggression and subsequent withdrawal of affection rather turned me off continuing to see her, and also put me on a ""woah hold up what the fuck?"" state. I have some compassion for what kind of life she must have known, but I have to say this was a rather disturbing encounter for me, and if we're being honest I think she owes me an apology more than anything else.

What might be the most emotionally intelligent way to handle this? How would you navigate this?

I’m looking for a fun, easygoing travel buddy (preferably a girl, just for comfort and vibe) to join me. Someone who enjoys street food, history, photography, or just aimless wandering and soaking in the city’s chaos and charm.

We could:
🍲 Go on a Chandni Chowk food crawl — parathas, jalebis, chaat, you name it.
🚶‍♀️ Wander the old lanes, bazaars, and monuments.
📸 Capture some candid moments in the heart of Delhi.
☕ End with a relaxed chai or coffee break.

I’m super chill, respectful, and just want to make this more fun by sharing the experience with someone local (or another traveler like me!).

If you’re from Delhi/Noida and this sounds like your vibe, let’s connect 🙌

When I want to repair them, I often can’t find how. Sometimes YouTube helps, but neither the machine’s manual nor most videos/blogs explain something as simple as *how to open the machine* or do a basic DIY maintenance service.

It makes me wonder—maybe brands do this intentionally?

I’ve faced the same problem with other devices too, like my baby’s bottle warmer. Not everything is on the internet or in the manual!

1nhlf1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nhlf1s/explore_the_best_appliance_slider_tray_bamboo_for/,Explore the Best Appliance Slider Tray Bamboo for Coffee Maker Use,"The Bamboo Appliance Slider, model B0DXF74MQK, has quickly become one of the most practical additions to my kitchen setup. As someone who uses heavy countertop appliances daily, I was tired of struggling to pull out my massive KitchenAid mixer or clunky air fryer from under cabinets. This bamboo sliding tray promised to put an end to that hassle, and honestly, it has delivered in more ways than I expected.

**Design and Build Quality**  
I’ve tested plenty of kitchen accessories over the years, but the first thing you notice about this sliding tray is its premium bamboo construction. None of that flimsy plastic nonsense here—this tray is made with solid, multi-layered bamboo that feels sturdy and reliable. It easily supports up to 40 pounds without any sign of bending or wobbling, which means even my heaviest appliances, like the stand mixer, rest comfortably on it. The natural bamboo finish also gives it an elegant touch, blending seamlessly into the aesthetic of my kitchen. It’s clear this wasn’t thrown together haphazardly; the thoughtful design has definitely impressed me.

**Ease of Use**  
The smooth-glide mechanism on the tray is a game-changer. I was skeptical at first—would this really slide effortlessly with one finger under the weight of a 30lb mixer? Turns out it does, and remarkably so. The rolling system is incredibly smooth, and it doesn’t leave any marks on my countertop thanks to the non-marking wheels. I can now pull out my coffee machine or blender in seconds without straining my arms or worrying about scratches on my granite counters. It’s honestly made my mornings ten times easier when I’m still half-asleep trying to brew coffee.

**Positives**  
- Effortless sliding mechanism works with heavy appliances.  
- Premium bamboo material offers both durability and aesthetic charm.  
- Protects countertops from scuffs and scratches.  

[Check Bamboo Appliance Slider B0DXF74MQK price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0dxf74mqk/)

**Versatility and Size**  
Measuring 16""D x 13""W, this tray fits nearly every one of my kitchen appliances. I’ve tested it with my air fryer, Ninja blender, Keurig coffee maker, and Instant Pot—all fit comfortably without requiring any adjustments. It really saves you from countertop chaos, especially if you’re juggling multiple appliances in a smaller kitchen space. Plus, the tray’s size is neither too bulky nor too small; it feels just right for the majority of countertop devices.

**Flaws**  
As outstanding as the sliding tray is, there are a few areas of concern:  
- The bamboo surface, while durable, could use a waterproof finish to better protect against spills.  
- Dust tends to collect on the undercarriage of the wheels, so cleaning can be a bit of a tedious process.  
- It doesn't work as smoothly on uneven countertop surfaces—it glides perfectly on granite and quartz, but might require some manual adjustments on tiled counters with small grooves.

**Competing Products**  
During my search, I also looked into similar sliding trays made from plastic. Options like cheaper plastic appliance caddies come to mind, but they hardly compare. While they are budget-friendly, they tend to flex and crack under heavier loads. On the other hand, metal trays can support more weight but lack the aesthetic appeal of bamboo and can feel cold and utilitarian in a cozy kitchen setting. Compared to its competitors, this bamboo tray strikes an ideal balance of strength, practicality, and visual charm. Alternatives often excel only in one or two areas, while this product covers all the bases—functionality, build quality, and style.

**Price Performance**  
Investing in kitchen accessories usually feels like a gamble, especially when there are so many cheaper options floating around, but this sliding tray feels worth every penny. Considering its heavy-duty construction and how much easier it makes accessing my appliances, it’s hard to put a price on the convenience it brings to my daily routine. Cheaper competitors may lure you in, but you may find yourself replacing them within months, whereas this tray feels built to last.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1nhldsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nhldsd/b3l13v3/,B3L13V3,"Yesterday was normal. So regular, boringly normal that I can still remember every detail:



Dad was sitting at the table, eyes glued to the newspaper.

Mom hummed her song off key while pouring coffee.  

My slippers were on the left side of the bed, where they've been since the last decade.

The fridge clock stuck at 9:17 for exactly sixty seconds before ticking forward again.  



Everyday cycle. Regular, boring, unchanged.  



This morning, I woke up, or at least I think I did, and nothing was the same.



The slippers were on the right side. Not close, but perfectly aligned, as if carefully placed.  

The fridge clock wasn’t analog anymore. A square LED one blinked in steady pulses, like a heartbeat.  

The toothbrush in the cup was red, rather than blue. I could swear I’d used that blue one for years, or had I?



Small changes. Easy to dismiss. But when you know every corner of your life, you notice when it bends.  



I whispered to myself, “It’s fine. I’m just tired.”  



Then Dad walked in.  



His beard was gray and heavy, thick as a brush. His hair was longer, falling on his forehead. He looked like a man who had been unkempt for weeks.  



I asked him how he grew such a beard in one day or if it was fake. He just smiled in a way that didn’t reflect in his eyes. 



“It’ll all make sense soon, just trust us.”  He said.



“What is that supposed to mean?” I asked. He ignored me as if the sentence had never reached his ears. 



My insides turned.  



The house was full of cracks that could no longer be ignored, 



The cereal box in the cupboard was already half empty, I clearly remembered buying it the day before. Who ate it? When?  

The TV anchors smiled with familiar faces, but their mouths didn’t match the words. Their voices echoed half a second too late.  

Family photos looked off, same clothes, same living room, but my smile didn’t reach my eyes. I looked distant.  

The whole experience? Uncanny.

I had an obvious expression on my face, one that showed I knew everything wasn’t normal.  



My parents noticed.  



“Sit down,” Mom said. “Don’t strain yourself.”  

“You’re just confused,” Dad said shortly after. His voice was too soft, like he was reading a rehearsed line. 



When I tried to leave, they blocked the door. Mom’s hand brushed mine, ice cold. Dad’s eyes were red, tired, but he didn’t say a word.  



I shoved past them and ran outside. They didnt follow.



I tried calling emergency services. Instead of a dispatcher, a cheerful hold jingle played. But the jingle warped, first slowing down, then speeding up, like a cassette tape melting in heat. No voice ever came on the line.  



I hung up, heart pounding.  



The street was filled with taxis idling in silence. Every cabbie wore mirrored sunglasses. Heads turned in unison as I sprinted past. One stepped out and reached for me with perfectly predicted timing.  



I struggled and fought free, stumbling forward, and spotted a cop at the corner.  



“Help! I need help! The people, my parents, everything-” I shouted.  



She turned slowly, her eyes calm and unblinking. “I know,” she said. “I’ve seen this before.”  



When I blinked my eyes, I woke up in a hospital bed. A doctor removed some sort of equipment, almost like a helmet, from my head. Machines buzzed around me. My parents sat on either side, gripping my hands too tight.  



“You fainted,” Dad said gently.  

“You’re very sick,” Mom whispered. “But this is for your treatment.”  



A man in a lab coat stepped into the room. He didn’t introduce himself. His voice was flat, and without a speck of emotion.  

“You are part of a controlled experiment,” he said. “Your memory resets at the end of each cycle. You retain fragments from before, but nothing more. Each day is reconstructed with changes: subtle shifts in the environment, behavioral changes in family, technology adjustments. The goal is simple, to find out how long it takes before you place complete, unquestioning trust in the procedure. Let what is happening happen, go through with it. That is all we ask of you.”  



I stared at him. “And if I fail to?"" 



“Then we reset the cycle again,” he said. “Until you do.”  



On the monitor beside me, a batch number blinked steadily, reading B3L13V3.  



Mom squeezed my hand harder. Dad kept his eyes down, trying to hold back his emotions.



I’ve tried leaving signs.



A smudge on the bathroom mirror.  

An X carved into a coin in my pocket.  

A scar on the tissue at the base of my thumb.

Every reset blurs them, fades them. Sometimes changes them completely. But some traces survive. That’s how I know it isnt all in my mind.



The cereal box dates. The beard growth. The length of shadows outside the window. I thought only one day had passed. Fourteen days have gone. Maybe more.  



They keep putting me back at the start.  



I don’t think the machine only affects memory. I believe it warps reality itself.  



Sometimes the resets feel too perfect. Objects placed with inhuman precision, conversations delivered like scripted lines. Other times, it glitches: jingle loops, smiles out of sync, my own handwriting appearing where I don’t remember leaving it.  



What if the real world is just another layer? What if I’ve never actually left the machine?  



I don’t know how many times this has happened.  

I don’t know how much of me survives between loops.  

I don’t even know if writing this will survive.  



But I can feel it from the looks in their eyes, they’re about to plug me in again.  



Tomorrow I’ll wake up. My slippers will be in the wrong place. The fridge will hum differently. Mom will hum her song out of key. Dad will say to trust them. Yet, somehow about all of it will be different, something I can not place my finger on.



And I’ll know it’s all wrong. I always do. But no matter how many times I fight, no matter how many marks I leave, they’ll reset me.  



They won’t stop until I break.  

They won’t stop until I submit. 



And maybe that is why i never will.

1nhl8wn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhl8wn,Has anyone had a false positive this dark? Unknown DPO.,"
How many false positive urine tests have you received? Have you ever had a false negative blood HCG?

Any idea what could have happened in my situation to cause multiple positive home tests (purchased from different stores) but a blood test <1 HCG, lots of symptoms, and light bleeding post tubal ligation. I am thinking it was a chemical pregnancy. 

I just had my 3rd baby in March (I have a 4 year old, 2 year old, and 5 month old). I am breastfeeding and haven’t had my period yet (for me it tends to return at 12 months post partum.) I chose to have a tubal ligation in May since we didn’t intend to have more kids and to decrease my risk of cancer given my family history. 

For about 1-1.5 weeks at the end of August, I was experiencing definitive pregnancy symptoms that I had with all 3 of my kids. 

Then last Friday 9/5 I bled after intercourse (I don’t usually bleed). Then Saturday morning my pregnancy symptoms were undeniable so I took a test and it was instantly positive (photo attached).I went to the ER since it was a weekend and my husband and I were concerned it was ectopic in light of a tubal ligation. My HCG at the hospital was <1. They said it must be a false positive urine test and sent me home.

Sunday morning I had another positive test but the line was much lighter. By the following day my symptoms were subsiding.

I moved on, chocked it up to a weird series of events. My therapist (I have PPD/PPA) insisted I message my doctor to clarify the details (since we never had a discussion about all details) and make sure there isn’t a risk that it was a chemical ectopic and product was left behind…given that this was 3 months after my tubes were removed. So, I messaged my doctor. Her response essentially said that “You had false positives, your brain imagined a pregnancy, you imagined the symptoms, the bloodwork was <1 HCG, dont ask me about this again.” 

I do have anxiety but I’m not nuts! This is the same doctor who did my tubal ligation 3 months ago so I think that she would rather tell me I’m crazy than consider the fact that there may be an error with her surgery. I know human error can impact blood results, and I personally had doctors, from a fertility clinic no less, call me up and say that their lab mistakenly switched patient vials and we have to get new blood work done. So I know it’s possible that a mistake could happen.

The more I think about it, the more it seems too coincidental. My symptoms were real, i was bloated, peeing all night long, nauseous (anything triggered me—I couldn’t feed my dogs, drink coffee, smell a towel that hung in the bathroom for a day after my husband used it (that was my first pregnancy symptom with my last kid), insatiable appetite, craving salty French fries and mass amounts of protein, exhausted by 8 pm, falling asleep doing my kids bedtime, fatigue during the day, insomnia randomly at night, etc. Even my Apple Watch data change from mid August onward (HRV decreased and steadied out). These were all things I experienced with my other pregnancies as well. 

Since I had my tubal, I didn’t think I could get pregnant. I had no reason to assume I would be pregnant and imagine these symptoms. It was only when the symptoms were so undeniable that I took the test. I truly felt pregnant. I don’t even want to try to have a conversation with my doctor about it out of fear she will say I’m crazy but I really do think I had a chemical pregnancy and something must have failed with my tubal ligation. 

How many false positive urine tests have you received? Have you ever had a false negative blood HCG? Am I over analyzing this and my doctor is right, it was just a bunch of false positive tests purchased from different stores? ",1,1757941357.0,TFABLinePorn,4,0.67,False

The Nespresso ENV120BM Vertuo Next had been on my radar for a while, so I decided to give it a try. This sleek, matte black coffee maker had everything — from its compact design to the promise of café-quality coffee at home. After weeks of brewing, experimenting, and savoring, I’ve gathered a mix of thoughts on this machine. While it ticked many boxes, there are still areas where it could step up its game. Here’s the lowdown on this compact brewer.

**Compact Design and Sustainability**

One of the first things I noticed was the machine’s size. At just 5.5 inches wide, it fits almost anywhere, whether on a congested kitchen counter or a cozy office nook. The black matte finish gives it a refined, minimalist touch. What caught my attention even more was the machine's sustainability aspect. Being made from 54% recycled materials was a welcome surprise. It felt good knowing that a product I was using daily was designed with the planet in mind. This small detail made my morning brews feel a little greener, but I did wonder why more recycling information wasn’t accessible right from the packaging.

The patented Centrifusion technology scans the barcode on the capsule and automatically adjusts the brewing parameters to ensure consistency in flavor and aroma. It’s almost like the machine reads your mind for your preferred strength and taste. My mornings have never felt easier, and each cup retained a level of smoothness and crema that I wouldn’t expect outside a fancy café. Despite this, I did notice a slight learning curve in placing the capsules for the first few days — they’re not as “pop-and-go” as I imagined.

**Versatility in Brewing Options**

Having choices is always a plus when it comes to my coffee rituals. This tiny powerhouse can brew 5, 8, and even 18-ounce coffees, as well as single or double espressos. With this versatility, I could start my day with a small espresso and switch to a longer pour for an afternoon pick-me-up. The variety of blends in the complimentary capsule starter pack was delightful, offering tastes ranging from bold to fruity. However, I couldn’t help feeling a pinch when realizing this machine is strictly compatible with Nespresso Vertuo capsules. Alternatives simply won’t work, which limits spontaneity on days where you’re out of Vertuo pods.  

**Strengths**

• Compact and space-saving  
• Sustainable materials with a modern, matte black finish  
• Effortless brewing with one-touch functionality  
• Includes an assortment of capsule blends to explore flavors  

**Limitations**

• Dedicated exclusively to Vertuo capsules, limiting flexibility  
• Initial use requires getting used to aligning the capsules properly  
• Capsules cost more compared to other brands  

**Built-in Frother and Added Perks**

The bundled Aeroccino3 milk frother was a pleasant surprise, delivering thick, velvety foam within seconds. It worked wonders for both hot and cold froth options — turning a regular cup of coffee into a café-style cappuccino or latte with no extra effort. My youngest cousin, who’s obsessed with hot chocolate, was equally thrilled when I used it to froth milk for a rich cocoa treat. This added accessory instantly elevated the experience, though I secretly wished it cleaned itself with the same ease that it frothed milk!

**Other Options**

Stacking this machine against competitors, two rivals, in particular, stood out. The Keurig K-Café, which supports a wider range of third-party coffee pods, offers similar versatility and built-in frothing at a comparable size. Meanwhile, the Lavazza A Modo Mio Tiny stands as a solid alternative for its affordable capsule pricing and intuitive design. However, neither delivers the same crema or has quite the high-tech barcode scanning that ensures every cup brewed with the Vertuo Next is truly exceptional.

**Price Performance**

After considering the features, ease of use, and coffee quality brewed by this Nespresso machine, it’s safe to say it’s worth its price for any coffee enthusiast seeking ultimate convenience. Yes, the cost of the machine and capsules may stretch a bit if you’re on a tighter budget, but the overall quality, from crema to flavor strength, justifies the investment. If you’re making multiple trips to grab your coffee outside daily, the machine will likely pay for itself in no time by bringing the café home.

Here are some of my Top 10 Tips for maximum knowledge absorption (with no robotic interference whatsoever):

1. Drink water. It keeps the… uh… brain-meat moist and functional.


2. Use flashcards (paper rectangles with info). Humans love rectangles.


3. Take breaks every 25 minutes. Stare at the wall like a classic mammal.


4. Study with friends, also known as “study buddies.” Exchange knowledge-sounds with them.


5. Highlight important text. The glowing yellow pigment pleases the optical sensors—uh, eyes.


6. Sleep. Shut down for 7–9 hours. Let the subconscious update patches install.


7. Find a good environment. Libraries are excellent. Basements also work if you are… comfortable with darkness.


8. Break material into chunks. Do not attempt to ingest entire textbook at once.


9. Teach the concept to someone else (or to your pet/furniture). If they understand, congrats. If they don’t, still congrats.


10. Reward yourself with chocolate or snacks. Positive reinforcement loop complete.

1nhl6oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/amipregnant/comments/1nhl6oq/has_anyone_had_false_positives_home_tests_or/,Has anyone had false positives home tests or false negative blood tests?,"Any idea what could have happened in my situation to cause multiple positive home tests (purchased from different stores) but a blood test <1 HCG, lots of symptoms, and light bleeding post tubal ligation. I am thinking it was a chemical pregnancy. 

I just had my 3rd baby in March (I have a 4 year old, 2 year old, and 5 month old). I am breastfeeding and haven’t had my period yet (for me it tends to return at 12 months post partum.) I chose to have a tubal ligation in May since we didn’t intend to have more kids and to decrease my risk of cancer given my family history. 

For about 1-1.5 weeks at the end of August, I was experiencing definitive pregnancy symptoms that I had with all 3 of my kids. 

Then last Friday 9/5 I bled after intercourse (I don’t usually bleed). Then Saturday morning my pregnancy symptoms were undeniable so I took a test and it was instantly positive (photo attached).I went to the ER since it was a weekend and my husband and I were concerned it was ectopic in light of a tubal ligation. My HCG at the hospital was <1. They said it must be a false positive urine test and sent me home.

Sunday morning I had another positive test but the line was much lighter. By the following day my symptoms were subsiding.

I moved on, chocked it up to a weird series of events. My therapist (I have PPD/PPA) insisted I message my doctor to clarify the details (since we never had a discussion about all details) and make sure there isn’t a risk that it was a chemical ectopic and product was left behind…given that this was 3 months after my tubes were removed. So, I messaged my doctor. Her response essentially said that “You had false positives, your brain imagined a pregnancy, you imagined the symptoms, the bloodwork was <1 HCG, dont ask me about this again.” 

I do have anxiety but I’m not nuts! This is the same doctor who did my tubal ligation 3 months ago so I think that she would rather tell me I’m crazy than consider the fact that there may be an error with her surgery. I know human error can impact blood results, and I personally had doctors, from a fertility clinic no less, call me up and say that their lab mistakenly switched patient vials and we have to get new blood work done. So I know it’s possible that a mistake could happen.

The more I think about it, the more it seems too coincidental. My symptoms were real, i was bloated, peeing all night long, nauseous (anything triggered me—I couldn’t feed my dogs, drink coffee, smell a towel that hung in the bathroom for a day after my husband used it (that was my first pregnancy symptom with my last kid), insatiable appetite, craving salty French fries and mass amounts of protein, exhausted by 8 pm, falling asleep doing my kids bedtime, fatigue during the day, insomnia randomly at night, etc. Even my Apple Watch data change from mid August onward (HRV decreased and steadied out). These were all things I experienced with my other pregnancies as well. 

Since I had my tubal, I didn’t think I could get pregnant. I had no reason to assume I would be pregnant and imagine these symptoms. It was only when the symptoms were so undeniable that I took the test. I truly felt pregnant. I don’t even want to try to have a conversation with my doctor about it out of fear she will say I’m crazy but I really do think I had a chemical pregnancy and something must have failed with my tubal ligation. 

How many false positive urine tests have you received? Have you ever had a false negative blood HCG? Am I over analyzing this and my doctor is right, it was just a bunch of false positive tests purchased from different stores? ",1,1757941215.0,amipregnant,4,1.0,False

I love making homemade soy milk (only soybeans and water) in my MioMat machine. But I found when I added the milk to my coffee, it would begin curdling because of the high acidity of the coffee. (this sometimes happens with store-bought milk, too) I found that if I add a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda as I make the soy milk, that changes the pH enough so that it won't clump. I usually make 4 cups of soy milk at a time, so that's 1/2 teaspoon per 4 cups. Hopefully that'll help somebody out there because I struggled with this for quite a while.

Or perhaps I’m writing this to allow my subconscious to process that the relationship is truly dead and we’ll always remain separate and distant acquaintances together.

I wanted to write something introspective that weaved the ideas of a past that now seems like a dream, present that’s hollow and future that’ll never exist but frankly it sounds corny and I don’t know what words to put in what order to convey it. It’s more of a journal.

It’s a weird feeling, one I’ve never felt post-breakup before. I hate the feeling of ‘well you were right to keep it secret, or to hold isle of dogs close to your chest’, because I wish more than anything that I was wrong. It’s not a victory it’s a slap in the face by an arrogance used as a shield, and I don’t want it.

I’ve finally come around to wanting to play Cyberpunk and BG3 but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to. Not because I need a tour guide, that was always just a joke. But because I wanted you there, for someone to lean on when it got emotional, or when I wanted to share my thoughts or offer commentary. I wanted someone to share the burden that these massive stories would be as I went through and digested them, and I wanted to share my first reactions to everything with you. I love the soundtrack of 2077, it’s very good, so I listen to it without knowing why the music is how it is or when it’s played.

It’s odd knowing our inside jokes will never be spoken again, we don’t talk late into the night, that I’ll never be able to play your voice notes together. I wish I knew why, I wish there was more context to not being used to being a couple, I wish I knew what changed between when you went to (redacted for privacy) and the 27th of July that made it all go wrong. I wish It was something you’d be able to share with me. Maybe it’s because I had let my guard down, that I let myself be less rigid, and you didn’t like what you saw when I did that. No one is obligated to feel one way or the other, but I’m not a bad person for wishing it went another way. I wrack my head every day, trying to make sense of it all but not everything has a clean ending and that’s okay. And I’m not okay with it being okay. I hate having to just get on with it.


I find it annoying that tears increase mucous production


It’s weird meeting all these people that I had become so invested in only to become an orbiting acquaintance soon after. It’s weird wanting to know why as if that’ll make it any better. It’s weird knowing that I had a companion when I had my first surgery to share my life with, and that when it happens all over again in november, I’ll have to do it alone, in silence. It’s weird learning so much about myself, information that will never need to see the light of day. It’s weird moving on. It’s weird ‘trying’ to better myself knowing there’s no one to share it with, to create and build but for no one else. It’s not very healthy to ask ‘what’s the point’, and yet i do. But I still go through the motions because I rationally know i must.  It’s all very very weird. I wonder if you ever went through all the messages in the box i made.

I thought I had found my person, and through them my people. But really, you found me, and I lost you, and that makes me very sad. Soon I’ll have been without you for almost as long as we were together, and soon after that I’ll have been without you for longer than I even knew you. It was all so quick and I loved that but I wish we slowed down together but now we can’t and then that’s the end

But suppose that happened, suppose we never broke up, or decided to get back together, or any number of things brought our paths together again, Or even that I’m just being mopey now. I can’t believe that I’m crying over someone who couldn’t stand to cuddle with me, who would pull her arm away because I wanted to touch her. I can’t believe I’m sad over someone whos face dropped and grimaced every time I committed the sin of wanting to hug her. Someone who went from talking hourly with to airing my messages when all I wanted to know was why.I wish I didn’t take it personally or took your reasons for it at face value but I just can’t, i just can’t compute it


Everything is the same, and it all looks the same and it all sounds the same, but the sky feels a little more grey, food tastes a little more bland, I smile a little bit less, going on walks is a little more dim. Hanging out with friends is a little more dim. Despite everything, I still miss you.

So, like I said in my previous post I was at the bedside of my friend Anne when she passed…mentally and three days later she was taken from life support and passed physically. As you can imagine I was numb. My mind disconnected to cope with losing her. It was like going deaf in one ear. You can still hear but something is wrong…lost…and the world is unclear.

Since there was not going to be a wake or funeral per her request many of us…Anne’s friends took to social media to mourn her. I was doomscrolling when I saw something that froze me.  An acquaintance of ours, Ben Pires, an alleged psychic medium had posted this:

***Ben: Good News One and All. Anne reached out to me last night after her passing and wanted me to insure that all of you know that she is in a better place.***

Anne and I had always been skeptical of Psychic Mediums and of Ben especially. The idea that he would take her death as an opportunity to grow his business was bullshit and my initial instinct was to call him out but then I thought…What if he could talk to Anne? Could I be shutting out that possibility? I clicked on his profile and then went to the direct messages.

My hands floated above the keyboard. Was I really going to do this? After years of trying to debunk these assholes am I going to reach out to one?

Fuck it.

I wrote:

***John: Hey Ben, I saw your post from earlier. I was with Anne in the hospital, and I am sure that her passing was as much of a surprise to you as it was to me. I know that we have not been in the best terms the past few years, but I need your help. There were a lot of things left unsaid between Anne and I and if there is any way you can help me contact her spirit I would appreciate it. I don’t have much money, but I would be willing to part with some if you can help me.***

I cringed and gritted my teeth so hard when I pressed the send icon that I almost cracked a tooth. Almost immediately the response dots fired up and began their dance on my screen. If Ben was going to tell me to kiss his ass at least it would be quick, and I can give up on this nonsense.

***Ben: Hey, I wasn’t expecting to hear from you. Thanks for reaching out. Yeah I was on my Ouija board last night and she reached out with that message. I thought you guys thought I was full of shit.***

***John: I know we came across that way in the past, but I really think you made a connection, and I want to pursue it.***

***Ben: This feels like a setup. Are you going to tape or stream this?***

***John: No. No Setup, no stream, no broadcast I just want to ask her something.***

***Ben: What if she doesn’t respond?***

***John: Then she doesn’t, and I know that door is closed.***

***Ben: Ok, fair enough. I’m gonna need a grand.***

***John: 1000?***

***Ben: Yeah, that’s the skeptics rate.***

***John: Venmo?***

***Ben: Sure.***

***John: When can we do it?***

***Ben: Saturday morning 3:15am***

***John: WTF?***

***Ben: Best time to talk to the dead my friend.***

***John: Fine, I’ll Venmo the cash on Friday.***

He paused. The dots flickered again.

***Ben: She said you’d come.***

My heart skipped a beat with that last message. He was probably fucking with me, but what if he wasn’t?

The week went by slowly. I watched all our friends virtually mourn Anne’s passing. There were incredible pictures of her young and in school plays and musicals, worked crazy jobs, travelled, she was a remarkable person. My affection for her was not without grounds. Anne was legitimately cool.

A few people even direct messaged me to give condolences and tell me about Anne’s affection for me. They did not know that those messages were like a swarm of little daggers stabbing me in the heart.

How could they know?

Friday night came and I prepared by drinking gallons of coffee. Being older I no longer had the natural ability to stay up to 3 am so I needed caffeine to assist me.

Ben lived in the south end of Fall River in a three story tenement building. To my chagrin he was on the top floor. He had messaged me and said he would unlock the side door so I could come up. He didn’t want his eighty-year-old landlord Mrs. Saraiva waking up. I was slow to open the door, and it creaked loud enough to wake the damned. The stairway reeked of stale fried codfish. Every old Portuguese tenement in Fall River smelled like that.

I persisted up the stairs.

By the time I reached the top floor the heart monitor on my watch said I was doing 120 beats per minute. This was a mixture of all those steps and anxiety.

After I knocked on the door a couple of times it opened to reveal Mr. Ben Pires, thirty five, bald, with a goatee that looked like a poor attempt to be Anton LeVay.

“Hey, glad you made it,” he said.

“Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” I said. I really wanted to say that I could not believe I was doing this shit, but I was trying to make up for years of skepticism.

Ben was dressed as expected in all black. He wanted to look like a master of the mystic arts and understood the role perfectly. He walked me over to a wooden table where he already had the Ouija board.

He gestured to a seat directly across from the accessories.

“Please sit,” he said.

I did without a word, and he reciprocated in his own chair.

“Thanks for paying so quickly,” he said.

I had taken one of those internet payment plans to spread the thousand dollars over the course of a year because I didn’t have the whole sum. But he didn’t need to know that. As far as Ben was concerned I was flush with cash.

“Now, let’s get to business.”

“Yes, let’s,” I said.

Ben put his fingers on the planchette and began to speak.

*“Spirits, we seek entry. We call for one traveler among you. Let her cross, if she can.”*

His fingers began to vibrate and a few seconds later the planchette moved toward the “Yes” symbol on the board.

“We’re in,” he said.

I sat stoic. This wasn’t my first paranormal rodeo.

“Spirit world we are searching for a soul. The soul of our friend Anne. Can you bring her forth?”

Ben paused here. Then his fingers and the planchette swirled around the board in a figure eight. When they finished they landed back on the “Yes.” Ben nodded in affirmation of his own prowess.

“Are you there spirit?”

Again, the swirl. Again the “Yes”. A smile bloomed on Ben’s face like a sunflower.

“Is it you Anne? John is here. He is looking for you.”

Ben’s fingers traced the figure eight again. The planchette glided to *Yes.* His smile widened.  
“Is it you, Anne? John is here. He needs to hear from you.”

The planchette spun faster this time. My pulse quickened. It slowed. Stopped.

And the pointer rested hard on one word.

**No.**

I don't remember exactly what I did but there was a grand voyage being prepared to explore the jungles of Africa and South America. People were bringing steampunk-esque contraptions with them.

I saw a fortune teller in an alley who told me that there is supposed to be a clockwork/steampunk age of exploration right after the Victorian age which delayed the industrial revolution for some time. Jungle explorers similar to Indiana Jones, both male and female, would become famous and treated as heroes. Stories of their real life adventures captured human imaginations around the world. Media would have more jungle themed adventures, whether its games, animation, live-action etc. Art Steampunk would have as big a following as Art Noveau and Art Deco. Humanity would have a lot more knowledge of mechanical automatons and they would be more prevalent in antique shops. 

Apparently, Victorian style coffee shops illuminated with warm lamplight are more numerous.

But now that I was there, something happened, and the voyages that would have been were cancelled and humanity will simply have what you currently see in the history books. 

Panicking, I tried to remember what I did. Was it flirting with that glasses lady who seemed to be in a hurry? Was it the lengthy chat with that gentleman in that coffee shop who seemed to really excited about something?

Last I remember I sank to my knees in front of the fortune teller and said, ""There must be a way to- ""

This is for you, the one i dreamed living at the seaside with, raising our babies on the beach, walking barefoot in the sand while the sun burns our skin, kissing our salty sweaty lips and necks while the waves cover us, laying naked on the towel and enjoying eachother’s sight, holding hands on the street, passing people like they don’t exist around us, the one i wanted to see the world with, travel around cities’ old towns and drinking coffee at terraces while stealing smiles and glances, making love while getting lost in the sheets and our bodies intertwined, tasting eachother with hunger and neverending desire, the one i fighted with so much passion because i was afraid to lose, the one who held me in his arms at my lowest and still loved me after, the one who gave me wings to raise and dare to dream and want more, the one who i wanted to wake up next to, in the sunrise of our little comfy nest, in the sounds of the waves and people passing by not knowing that somewhere above them, in a little sunny bedroom, there’s a little miracle happening, the miracle of us. Of just being, skin on skin, a love so big and powerful it could move mountains and part seas. 
The one who raised me and brought me down to earth so many times it felt like a roller coaster, the one who, at some point, came looking for me and grabbed my hand into what i didn’t know would be the greatest love story of my life.

In my ongoing quest for distraction-free streaming, I tested five different services this year. Here’s how they stacked up for me—and why my channel list keeps changing.

* * *

### 1\. [XXIPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/Best_LPTV/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (or less if you lock in a longer **iptv subscription 2025**)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (heavy US/UK sports, good CA/FR mix)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (rarely any buffering, even during US primetime)
    
*   **My experience:** I found XXIPTV thanks to a UK-based **iptv reseller** who swore by their Premier League streams. To my surprise, it handled everything—NFL, UK comedy, French news—without a hitch. The **best iptv trial** was quick and painless, which made testing easy on my devices.
    

* * *

### 2\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://iptvmeezzy.life/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (cheaper if you go for multi-months)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (huge range: US, UK, CA, FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (very stable, just a little stutter on live Canadian games)
    
*   **My experience:** I ran into IPTVMEZZY via a recommendation from a friend in France. The variety is impressive; I found UK reality shows, CA news, and a surprising number of French documentaries. Most streams stayed steady, even late at night.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://aurorastreaming.online/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially strong for UK and FR, solid US/CA)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (generally good, but UK sport events can lag at peak)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming was an unexpected favorite. Their VOD library is better than most, especially for UK and FR classics. I did notice a bit of lag during a UK football final, but overall it’s been a solid pick for variety.
    

* * *

### 4\. [StreamGlobe IPTV](https://xxiptv.top/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 23,000+ live, 74,000+ VOD (mainly US/UK/CA, light on FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (fine for news and VOD; sports lagged during peak hours)
    
*   **My experience:** StreamGlobe IPTV is my “safe bet” backup. Great if you’re after US news, UK talk shows, or Canadian hockey. French content is limited but streams well. Their sign-up for [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) was straightforward—even for a caffeine-fueled brain like mine.
    

* * *

### 5\. UrbanCast TV

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 17,000+ live, 53,000+ VOD (US/UK basics, a bit of CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evenings brought more buffering, especially on UK and US sports)
    
*   **My experience:** UrbanCast TV is the “background TV” option. It covers essentials for US and UK, with a sprinkle of Canadian and French channels. Probably not for the sports-obsessed, but fine for background shows or casual watching. Their **iptv reseller** dashboard is clear too, if you’re curious.
    

* * *

My IPTV Thoughts After a Year of Testing
----------------------------------------

*   **Always try the best iptv trial** before you pay—your location and devices make a difference.
    
*   Don’t get distracted by massive channel counts. Figure out what you _actually_ watch (for me: UK panel shows, late US news, and the occasional French drama).
    
*   Even [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) brands have their off nights, especially with live sports in the US or UK.
    
*   Thinking of being an **iptv reseller**? Get ready for tech support requests from everyone you know.
    
*   And yes, always use a VPN—it’s just sensible these days.",0,1757940140.0,WooblesCodesLists,0,0.33,False

The screen flickers on,

twelve faces in tiny squares,

each nodding in loops

I mute my own silent scream,

and type “great point” once again.

Ferns crowd the hallway,

HR files reports on growth,

watering in rows

they say our roots are shallow,

and still we must learn to thrive.

Out of office boss,

my inbox is a desert.

I kneel for guidance.

A coffee cup left behind

becomes my holy relic.

Older than haiku, tanka stretches back over 1,300 years in Japan and was a courtly form of expression. It expands haiku into five lines (5–7–5–7–7 syllables), giving more room for reflection. Traditionally romantic or emotional, but modern tanka often play with contemporary themes.

I think a lot of folks know Haiku, but I find Tanka to be a more rewarding form to play with given the additional length.

And starting with some back ground, I (27M) am what folks would describe as an “emotional support potato”. I am everyone’s hype man, no matter if I’ve
Known you for years or minutes, I strive to make people feel supported and welcome because that is not something I have had for the majority of my life. I’m fairly introverted and shy, struggling to build deep connections. My best friend (26F) and I like to travel and vend at craft fairs, Ren Fairs, Psychic/spirituality festivals, etc as a hobby. We make a nice bit of side cash doing so but for us it’s more about having little bestie adventures. 
    So here is where the issue comes in. Since March of this year, her boyfriend has started traveling to these events with us. This does not bother me as it’s nice having the extra help at our booth and he and I get along quite well. So much so that another vendor out our last show that the he and I were dating (something that she found absolutely hilarious). We are currently getting ready for our last few events of the years and bestie got excited because she found out there is a ren fair happening about 30 minutes from our next event the day after and she wanted to go. 
     I told her it sounds like fun and she should go have a good time with her boyfriend so they can make a date out of it as I have to go back home and get ready for my regular job (I get up at 1:30 in the morning on mondays because of how much I have to travel for my job). This made her upset because she wanted me to go with them. I was honestly considering going until she dropped a comment that made me feel like a convenience instead of someone important. She said to me, “please? I really want you to come with us. I’m pretty sure he’s going to propose and I need someone to take pictures “
     Normally I’d be super hyped for my friends getting engaged, but that comment made me feel like she only wanted me there for my phone and not because I was her best friend. I haven’t really said anything about it other than the excuse of having to get ready for work because I don’t want her to feel like I’m unsupportive of her relationship and getting engaged woudl be something super exciting for her. So woudl I be the a hole for not being there if he proposes? 
   Feel free to ask any questions if you feel like I’ve left out any context. I apologize if some of the phrasing is confusing, I’m functioning on a gallon of coffee and 30 minutes of spiteful slumber

1nhkfje,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nhkfje/aitah_for_being_done_with_my_fiancé_because_of/,AITAH for being done with my fiancé because of how he handles his dogs and treats me?,"EDITED TO ADD: THIS BEHAVIOR FROM HIM DIDN'T START UNTIL WE MOVED HERE. BEFORE THIS HE WAS VERY, VERY DIFFERENT. 

I (F 37) have known my fiancé (M 37) for 25 years and we have been engaged for just over a year. He has not taken me on a single date over the past year, even though I spent $500+ every month traveling to visit him. I grew up in the city he lives in now, but I spent the last ten years living 800 miles away in Florida. I moved back here a month ago to be with him, leaving my support system behind. I have a sister and brother here, but both are busy with their own lives and we aren't very close, so I don't want to lean on them too much. 

Since moving, I have been sleeping on the couch because his two eleven year old dogs literally push me out of bed. And by that I mean that if I try to sleep in the bed, the male dog will force himself between my fiance and I by forcing his nose between us and separating us, pushing me towards the edge of the bed. Within a few minutes the female dog will come and literally use her legs to physically kick and force me off of the bed. I gave up fighting against them after about a week and a half.

When I finally told him how messed up it was that the woman he claims he wants to marry has been stuck on a couch for an entire month, he decided for the first time ever to shut the dogs out of the bedroom. He told me he was doing it for me, even though I told him not to, because I knew they would whine and cry all night.

Of course, I was right. He slept like a baby while I was kept awake all night by the dogs whining and scratching at the door. They even woke up my teenage daughter. By morning, I found shredded pillows, my blankets dragged around, and remnants of dog poop on the floor. 

He still calls this destruction “nesting,” even though both dogs are spayed and neutered and way past that stage. The female only had a litter or two when she was much younger. He claims he had no idea why the female pees and poops on the floor, but it only happens when I sleep upstairs with him. And when I get upset, he guilts me by saying to the dogs things like, “Oh puppies, why are you being so mean to mommy?”

I cannot keep tissues on the coffee table because he says the dogs will eat them. I cannot leave clothes (jackets, dresses, socks, shorts, anything) with my scent anywhere or the dogs will destroy them. (I have to keep my dirty clothes hamper in the same closet as my clean clothes because the entire basement where the laundry is is his man cave [I have been rejected 100% when it comes to having any space for myself], therefore the dogs are also allowed down there.) 

I have been begging him for a month to clip their nails and he still has not done it. His excuse is that they run away when he gets the nail clippers out. I've mentioned to him that his dogs are slipping on the vinyl floor because of their nails being so long. (He found the nail clippers yesterday, and gave them to me as though I'm going to cave and do it, and the only reason I'm going to is because I cannot stand the outright neglect.)

He refuses to meet my friends, saying the thought of meeting then makes him uncomfortable because he assumes they are all drug addicts, even though I have been sober for two years, and many of my friends were never even on drugs. The ones who were are in recovery, and honestly I was the last one to get sober. The addict friends I do associate with have been clean twice as long as I have, if not longer. I take my recovery very seriously, I go to multiple NA and CMA meetings every week, I'm involved in service work and have started working the steps recently as well.

He has made comments to my daughter about her father that no one even knows are true, just to hurt me. 

He accuses me of shoving my exes in his face, when the only time I mentioned my late husband was to say I was used to a normal dynamic of the husband working while the wife ran the household. I was married to my daughter’s dad for years, and before that to my boys’ father. Both wanted me to stay home and raise the kids, which was fine with me. But my fiancé twists that into guilt trips about how he cannot do it all himself, while at the same time making sure my daughter’s survivor benefits go first to cover things for the house.

I never agreed to buy this house. He pushed me to pick it out, even though I told him from the beginning I could not afford a mortgage. Now he guilt trips me constantly about expenses while still taking himself to concerts and eating out every single day. He goes to Chipotle, sushi, whatever he feels like, while I am stuck at home stretching groceries, always choosing between leftovers, ramen, or peanut butter sandwiches on generic bread. 

We have lived here a month and the house still looks bare. There is one picture on the wall, a Salvador Dalí print missing the glass, so it looks cheap. He keeps the thermostat at 68 degrees, which is freezing for me and my daughter who are used to 74 to 76 in Florida. I asked for a compromise at 70-71 and he refuses because he is comfortable at 68.

I am drained. He only started trying to fix things once I met him know I have a place that I can go to right now no questions asked (but that option involves living with an ex who is still in love with me (who has told me he has HPV and is polyamorous now [no judgement just not a lifestyle I want my daughter around]), switching school districts, etc. and I'm not trying to bounce around with a teenage daughter. He frames everything like it is “for me,” but ignores what I actually need. Meanwhile I am left financially bankrupt every month, emotionally manipulated, and carrying all the fallout.

But this is what happened.  At the store I found some funny inexpensive little Halloween characters and I thought that it would be funny to get them for my WH for his D&D game night with his friends because they use little characters like that on some game board. 😄 * Im not pretending to know a lot about the game)  anyways on Saturday night he had a D&D session at his friend's house so I told him why don't you bring those a d put them in with the gaming stuff.  So ok he left and whent gaming. ..  so yesterday morning I just happened to ask him what his friends thought of those funny gaming pieces, and if they were the same size as the ones that they use. He said that they really liked them and they were at his friend's house with all of the other ones.... we'll cool beans then.

  So an hour later I get in the car to take my Daughter to work and what do you think is sitting on the seat of the car? 🙄 I bring them in and ask WH where he really went and who he was with? Then When he said he was gaming at (blank s) house I threw both bags of figures down on the coffee table.  (Because what else am I supposed to think with my betrayal trauma mind ) right? So I asked him if he went on a date with someone 🤔.  He said that he lied because he didn't want me to think that he didn't appreciate them because he forgot them in the car.   First of all Im not that fragile,  and secondly Im used to him forgetting things. He has ADHD and forgets things all of the time. I've just kind of adapted to that over the years 🤷‍♀️ It's just part of who he is and I love the good and the not so good. 

 But this isn't the only thing.  He always lies about stupid stuff and it just doesn't make any sense . I. Not going to get mad if he forgets to take out the garbage,  or feed the cats? One time about 12 years ago he lied to me about losing his job and went to his friends every day so that I would think that he was at work,  until his friends girlfriend told me.  How am I supposed to trust him again after the Affairs if he can't even tell me the truth about something that small?

I had to quit my dream job as an ED RN due to conflicting hours with daycares and lack there of on the weekends to find a hospital administration job - 8-4 M-F. However, the training has been requiring me to commute to hospitals 30-50 minutes away, and I’m taking a big pay cut. I know it’s temporary, so I’m not complaining.

My complaints are due to my husband. Now before anyone bashes him, he is my best friend - he’s the best cat dad, a loving father, an amazing human. He helps keep the house clean without nagging, does all of the yard work, and pays all of the bills. The money situation is a whole other conversation that I’ll spare you all from, but we are well off (once our loans are paid off). 

I feel so alone and without support. He works different schedules on the regular - 7a-2p, 2p-11p, 7a-7p, 7p-7a - as well as different hospital sites. I’m very understanding that it’s difficult for him to wake up early to help me as I get ready for work when he gets home late or has to work a later shift and needs more sleep. However, he’s not understanding HOW TIRED AND STRESSED I AM. 

To leave at 7a, I have to get up at 4a just to eat breakfast, drink coffee, get dressed, feed the baby, get my pump parts all together, put the baby back to sleep, and entertain him! I do everything I can to make the mornings easier - forego a decent breakfast and mix coffee with protein powder, shower the night before, lay all of my clothes out, wash the never-ending pump parts - and it’s still not enough. 

When I have to leave and I’m not the one taking my son to daycare at 630a, my husband complains that he has to be up with the baby when he’s so tired. He  has never had to wake up in the middle of the night, doesn’t do wash my pump parts without complaint (I just do it myself now to avoid it), never had to take the baby in so early, doesn’t pack my lunches, or gotten ready for work with the baby home. Heck, he will bring the baby to daycare on his days off so he can have “his time” running errands and working out. 

He doesn’t understand the sacrifices I’ve done to make this work. He won’t let me be a SAHM because of my student loans, he brushes off anything I have to say about my emotional wellbeing and somehow brings it back to my lack of working out. I’ve even written him an email articulating how I feel and how it hurt my feelings to be told “you need to be put on meds” when I finally screamed at him one day (when I was trying to get ready for a baby shower and he put a crying baby on the bed for me to attend to while he stretched instead of consoling/getting bottles ready/whatever.)

Last night I asked him to take the baby to daycare as late as possible (10a) because I have to be at a hospital 40 minutes away at 7a instead of 8 and I wanted to do a quick 30 minutes at the gym afterwards since I don’t get the luxury of “having a day off.” All he said was “make sure you put the baby down for a nap before you leave.” Seriously? As I sit here drinking my lukewarm protein coffee, I’m just trying to calculate what time I would have to wake up in order to meets ALL of our needs. Baby woke up at 4 with me on his own accord, fell back asleep, and will probably wake up again at 6 when I have to go. I’ve already been late to work THREE times in my first week because of these kinds of things. Do I need to wake up at 3am instead? Seriously, what does he want from me?

I just feel like I’m the only one picking up the slack and it fucking hurts. 

There’s SO much more but I just can’t even think about it right now.

Now, after much thought I believe that Substack is actually done and dusted.

You might think that it is talk of the town and the most hip blogging platform these days but hear me out.

The substack business model doesn't make sense. Knowledge have always been essentially free. Books pack a tonne of knowledge and very often life's work of people and sell for $10-$40 a piece. Books cost also include the paper, binding, distribution, publisher and writers get a small cut. Self published books have higher margins but are typically cheaper as well. Substack's minimum monthly charge is $5 per user per month. Now how much useful information can an individual possibly create in a month.

Substack and their founders somehow think that sending a newsletter to willing patrons is good enough to build a huge company. I am not saying it doesn't have a market. It does. Just like patreon or buy me a coffee. Why it is done and dusted is because they aim to become a goto publishing platform. They raised $100 million.
