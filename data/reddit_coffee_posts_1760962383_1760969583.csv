I hate people I meet on hikes.
Not because they were rude or annoying, but because they were the kind of people I wish I could keep forever. The kind of people who’d hand you their last bottle of water without hesitation or who’d help you scramble over a boulder like you’ve been friends for years. The kind who’d share stories under a sky sprinkled with stars, the laughter echoing through the campsite like music. And then, just like that, they disappear when the hike ends.
It feels unfair, really. You climb together, sweat together, marvel at the same breathtaking views, and even get through moments of exhaustion and struggle together. You bond over the simplicity of life on the trail, stripped of all pretensions. For a brief moment, these strangers feel more like home than the people you see every day. But when you reach the end of the trail, everyone goes their separate ways, back to their own lives.
I’ve met people who became like siblings over just a weekend hike. There was that girl who lent me a dry jacket when I got soaked in the rain, the guy who made the best coffee at 4 a.m. at the summit, and the group that sang terribly off-key songs to keep spirits up during a grueling descent. Every one of them left a little mark on me, and yet, most of us never crossed paths again.
I hate that hikes teach me to appreciate fleeting connections and then force me to let them go. I hate that these people remind me of how beautiful human kindness and camaraderie can be, only for it to fade into a memory.
Maybe that’s why I keep hiking—to meet more of these amazing, temporary people. To share more campfires, more stories, and more of those bittersweet goodbyes that remind me how rich and beautiful life can be, even if just for a little while.

1objyjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1objyjd/does_memantine_provide_clarity_in_life/,Does memantine provide clarity in life?,"Hello, I have a query. Interestingly, I feel less afraid, more confident, and have more clarity of thought after taking memantine. Additionally, I've discovered that I like TV series and films far more than I used to.

I'm not sure if this is a placebo or if memantine is actually involved. I've been experiencing these symptoms for the last three to four days whenever I take 10 mg. I believe 10 mg is typically plenty, but occasionally it also occurs when I take 20 mg.

Since I'm also using Rhodiola rosea with it, I'm not entirely sure which is in charge of what. In the morning, my go-to combination is Rhodiola rosea, memantine, moda and coffee from nowfoods, highstreetpharma and ndepot.

1objyaa,https://i.redd.it/hpb7gz12y9wf1.png,Method for putting large fish in your satchel.,"I don't know if this is well known, but I've never seen it mentioned anywhere. If you catch a large fish and pick the cook option you will set up camp and cook 1 piece of meat.

If you leave the camp set up and catch another and choose cook again, you'll cook another piece but have 3 more pieces and the fish in your satchel.

So the first fish gets you only 1 piece of meat, but each additional fish gives you 4 as well as the fish. You can't break the fish down but you can sell it or donate it to camp.

It's best to do somewhere you set camp right next to the water, by the legendary moose is good, as well as owanjila. But there's a ton of good spot.

So idea is simple, we meet for a leisurely breakfast / lunch in a chosen place in Bangalore.  Eat food and conversation follows. Over a period, we may become friends. If not, we just enjoy some food and a coffee/tea.  Please note it is just a food meetup and not a drink meetup or any hookup meetups.

**December 13, 2025**

* 3:22 pm - land at OGG (and pick up car)
* 4:00 pm - Costco Stop
* 5:00 pm - Check in at Airbnb in Kula
* 6/7:00 pm - Dinner at Kula Bistro

**December 14, 2025**

* Road to Hana day
   * We are doing this ourselves and our rental car is a Chevy Malibu--*is this safe???* The more I read about road to Hana, the more I am realizing how many people book professional tours.
   * Some stops I noted are: Punalau Falls Hike, Aunty Sandy's Banana Bread, Ke’anae Peninsula, Upper Waikani Falls, Pua'a Ka'a State Wayside, Hāna Farms Roadside Stand Pizza Oven and Bakery, Waiʻānapanapa State Park, Braddah Hutts BBQ Grill
* Dinner at AirBnb

**December 15, 2025**

* 8:30 am - O'o Farms Coffee Tour
* \~1:00pm - Keawakapu OR Palauea Beach day
   * Any other beach suggestions in south maui? These are two I found that looked good, but I'm open to whatever is best! We don't want anything too crowded and we obviously want it to be pretty haha. Since we aren't staying at a resort, choosing a beach has been tough!
* Dinner suggestions!

**December 16, 2025**

* 3 am - Haleakalā Sunrise 
   * Is the sunrise or sunset a better option?? I'm worried about the sunrise being a lot of work and the trip not feeling very relaxing if we do this. I also saw that the star gazing after sunset looked so beautiful. Overall, this is like the only day we'd have to sleep in so I'm second guessing the sunrise. Lmk. 
   * Also, if we do the sunrise, what time should we aim to arrive?
* Another beach day (more beach suggestions please, doesn't have to be south maui!)
* Dinner suggestions!

**December 17, 2025**

* 10 am - Check out of Airbnb
* Our flight isn't until 4:30, so we need suggestions on what to do this day before our flight and after we check out of our Airbnb!!
* 2:00 pm - Arrive at LIH to go to Kauai",1,1760969238.0,MauiVisitors,0,1.0,False

So this is a long story with a lot of context. I (25F) currently live in an apartment with my (27F) fiancé. We also live with our friend (25F) who has a boyfriend who doesn’t live with us. This was the arrangement when we moved in. She was aware we were a couple, and we were all friends before we lived together. Recently our roommate has been spending most days and nights away from the apartment at her boyfriend’s. No problem for us, we just get some extra alone time. We figure they have more space over there anyway. 

For the most part we have enjoyed living with her. We had a lot of fun and she introduced us to some really good shows and movies I wfh and she was really nice company on the days she was home. She is really lax on chores which is not great for me (I do almost all chores because I enjoy cleaning, but her room sometimes smells musty into the hallway) but whatever, it was never a big deal for me. Our apartment is clean and tidy because I do an evening “closing shift” and make sure there are no dishes in the sink, coffee is ready for tomorrow, etc. I also do deep cleans with my partner every weekend. 

This past week, our friend texts that she wants an apartment meeting. We haven’t had one in a while, and we had nothing going on, so easy enough. At this meeting she tells us that she doesn’t want to live with us or be friends with us anymore. It wasn’t entirely shocking because we had been drifting but still very upsetting because I was really looking forward to her being in my wedding party. 

We asked her why and she said that she “didn’t want to live in the past”. I said that we were owed an explanation for why she wanted to break lease. Her parents are very well off and well connected (all of her jobs are set up by them, they pay her rent, and send her hundreds every month to spend on dates with her boyfriend). My fiancé and I have nearly no safety net. We grew up in poverty and debt and are trying to dig our way out. So of course being told that we would have to absorb her portion of the rent was incredibly stressful. I am also struggling with a new chronic illness that my doctors can’t figure out. I can barely afford my medical bills and now I have to think about getting another full time job. 

She eventually said that we “trigger her trauma” but still would not give an example as to why. I got very angry and raised my voice. I know that I shouldn’t have, and I have apologized profusely for having done that. I have PTSD from growing up in foster care, so I know yelling can be a big trigger. I feel terrible that I didn’t think about it before. To my knowledge though, she doesn’t have any trauma tied to abusive parents or environment, she actually has a good relationship with her family and seems well supported, so I hope it didn’t impact her too much. 

We kept pushing her and she said that one time we left the dishes in the sink for too long. For context our dishwasher was broken and was in the process of being fixed. Right before she spoke to us about the dishes, we told her that she shouldn’t take shrooms with her boyfriend because her psychiatrist told her not to as she could have a psychotic break. She was clearly upset and left the room. She came back out and told my partner who was actively washing a plate, that she needs to do the dishes sooner. We definitely looked at her crazy because she seemed really mad about something not getting done that was actively being done. In our conversation she said that my partners “yeah, sure” was stonewalling. 

We ended up agreeing to just be roommates but I am still at a loss for what we did wrong. I thought everything was fine. Nothing had ever been a big problem in the relationship before. I was venting to a friend and she brought up something i had never heard before.  

I guess once when my partner and I were out, our friend, our roommate, and her boyfriend were all together in the apartment and our roommate was angry that we had left a box of food for our cat on the stairs for a few days. I knew the box was there, I was just being lazy. I had no idea she cared about a small box being at the foot of the stairs. If I did I would have moved it in a second. I guess she ended up SCREAMING about the box to her boyfriend and my friend. My friend said that she would just move it, but our roommate demanded she leave it there so that she “can see how long we let it go for.” I don’t know why she didn’t ask us to move it. We had no idea it upset her. 

So AITA for being lazy for a few days and not moving my cats food? ",1,1760969168.0,AITAH,1,0.99,False

I'm CF and single and I've been working to build a community of CF people in the last few years. I've noticed that many people come as a package deal with their partner. I went out for coffee with a woman from my gym and she brought her husband without warning. I reconnected with a family member who I have one thing in common with, and she always shows up with her husband -- who gets visible agitated when we talk about our one commonality. I have family friends who I sometimes call to check in on, and 10 minutes into the call I'll hear a cough and realize I'm on speakerphone with his wife listening in. And then I have a childhood friend who tells her wife everything. To the point that on the rare occasions I see them, her wife will ask me very personal questions about something I was dealing with 6mos back. They actually brag about being co-dependent and think it's funny.

I don't mind being the third wheel at an occasional dinner or coffee hang, but I don't understand why so many people can't be on their own for two hours at a time.

Is it just that my sample size for couples falls into this category or is this a known thing that all CF couples are deeply enmeshed? And if it is a common thing, what's the best way to indicate that I want to spend one-on-one time with the person I'm friendly with and not always their spouse?",0,1760968881.0,childfree,1,0.5,False

1objnrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/1objnrk/rediscovering_a_classic_my_jansport_right_pack/,Rediscovering a classic: my JanSport right pack review.,"# 🔍 Baseline

I am a 35 year old marketer living/working in NYC, and after nearly two decades of trying out sleek, tactical, and over-engineered bags, I’ve come full circle, right back to JanSport -- the bag that started it all for me! The Right Pack in Monochrome Black delivers understated style, daily comfort, and just enough utility. It’s not trying to impress, and that’s exactly why it works for me. I know everyones different -- you want a pocket for every little nicknack but maybe im a minimalist in disguise because i found having little pockets everywhere to add friction to me using the bag -- im really enjoying the basic dump style bag we have here in the JanSport.

# 🧵 Style & aesthetics

The monochrome black colorway is what makes this classic feel a bit more ""adult"" for me. Everything from the suede leather bottom, suede zipper pulls, straps, and logo, is blacked out. It gives the nostalgic silhouette a clean, modern, even slightly urban look.

This isn’t the JanSport you wore in high school. It’s grown up, refined, and quietly confident. I can wear it with techwear, streetwear, or a casual hoodie and still feel put together. i see a lot of bags around NYC that catch my eye but to be honest, i love how understated it is and how quiet it is no matter where i go or what i wear it with.

What I like about the bag is that it doesn’t look like i’m going climbing up mount everest after work, it doesn’t look like im some sort of tech ninja, it doesnt look like it can take sniper fire, it just looks like a backpack that carries things for me, and thats what i love. I love my able carry, my dsptch, and my TNF backpacks but they often look way over engineered, or overly techy… i love that this bag’s nostalgic design is so subdued and everyone just knows what it is… it’s simple, classic, and timeless to me. 

# 🛠️ Materials & build quality

The iconic suede bottom gives it structure and durability. The Cordura fabric feels lightweight yet sturdy, not overly stiff, not flimsy either. The zippers glide easily and feel dependable (though not YKK from what I can tell). The overall construction feels reliable enough for daily use without weighing you down.

I’ve tossed it under desks, overhead bins, and on park benches. No scuffs, no tears, no complaints. Time will tell however -- i imagine quality has gone down since the good ol' days .

What i've been flabbergasted by lately are bags that are so over engineered that they come like 4lbs EMPTY. this jansport weighs like 1.5lbs empty. for the build quality at this weight.. i like it alot. you sacrifice the little zippers and little pockets for your nicknacks but i would personally take a lighter bag and use my own bags and organizers. 

# 🗂️ Organization & everyday use

There’s a reason this layout hasn’t changed in decades: it works.

* **Main compartment**: spacious and simple, fits my 16” MacBook in the laptop sleeve, hoodie, notebook, snacks, water bottle and my tech pouch.
* **Middle pocket**: has a basic organizer for pens, charger, and smaller items.
* **Front pocket**: your basic, dump pocket with horizontal zip -- mostly my gum + snack pocket
* **No gimmicks**: no laptop-specific compartment, no MOLLE, no admin panel, and that’s refreshing to me personally.
* **Side water bottle pocket**: big enough to fit my 32oz owala bottle nice and snug, but i prefer the bottle inside so its not exposed to the elements here in NYC (subway air is filthy)

I’ve found it perfect for my workdays, baby errands, or city adventures. It stays low-profile and doesn’t scream “gearhead.” i loved having a packable tote in the front pocket for when i needed to get groceries after work one day.

# 💡 What surprised me

* The **comfort**, even with simple straps, it carries light loads beautifully. im not carrying bricks into the office -- i have a laptop and a few lightweight items so a piece of string would do the trick for me personally -- i found zero issues with the bag itself. i like the aesthetic of the bag being worn slightly lower too. i used to wear my bags high and tight but this bag calls for a more relaxed look and its been quite comfortable for me walking around nyc in and out of subways during rush hour.
* The **versatility**, looks just as good heading to a coffee shop as it does at the office. ive worn it out to meet friends, to a cafe, to the office, and to a bar. in a sea of tumi, filson, TNF, and all the random boutique brands in between, i personally feel liek this bag has a classic look that doesnt say im too old or that im too young... maybe on the younger side -- but the all black logo makes it hard to see its a jansport anyway. one person at the bar asked if it was a nanamica until i showed him the logo under the light to see that it was a jansport. we both laughed.
* The **emotional hit**, something about coming back to a JanSport as an adult feels nostalgic and self-assured. cant put a price to that or an exact feel but i just feel good about it overall. 

# 🧞‍♂️ What I wish it had

* A dedicated quick access pocket for my phone/wallet that's closer to my body. I don't like putting my phone in a dump pocket, especially when its so far from my body as i worry about pick pockets. so a dedicated pocket on the back panel or at the top couldve been great but i also understand that kind of pocket at the top can make the bag slouch. its not a must since i prefer keeping those valuables in my pant pockets anyway, but couldve been nice
* Front pocket where the pen holders are has a slip pocket -- i wish it was mesh so can see thru it. its not that deep so i can kinda see it from the top down view, but a mesh pocket to let me see directly thru it couldve been nice too

# 🧳 Final thoughts

The JanSport Right Pack in Monochrome Black feels like more than a backpack, it feels like a return to self. After years of chasing the “perfect” pack with endless compartments, tactical features, and performance specs, I realized I didn’t need more. I needed less, but done right. It's not bombproof like a goruck, but i am not gorucking or carrying 18lbs of camera equipment. it's not an able carry with waterproof zippers but i can remember once in my adult life where i got caught in the rain because i wasnt prepared. its not a 32L hiking pack because im a corporate desk monkey and dont need that much stuff throughout the week.

This bag doesn’t have a dedicated laptop compartment that i typically love, yet I still reach for it when commuting to the office. It doesn’t have compression straps or hidden pockets, but it carries exactly what I need and nothing more. It doesn’t have load lifters or sternum straps but its comfortable and lightweight for what i carry. It’s light, low-profile, and confident in its simplicity, just like the person I want to be these days.

Carrying this bag is a daily reminder that not everything has to be optimized. That nostalgia and comfort can co-exist with function and taste. That style doesn’t have to be loud to be intentional. And that maybe the best gear isn’t the one that impresses others, or even impresses on paper, it’s the one that feels like you. At <$70USD this is also something just worth trying imo. I have bags that are \~$250-$300 and i baby it... not that im wearing my jansport and dragging it across the concrete, but a little stain here, a little drip of sauce on the outside, i dont sweat it at all. i love how simple, easy to use, and easy to own the bag is. 

After 2 weeks of use for trips into the office, a quick weekend trip to visit my family, and trips to the coffee shop and grocery store, this looks like a keeper for me.

Once a simple octopus living in the seas around Iceland, Octodad dreamed of a human life. He managed to escape the ocean, move into the suburbs, and start a new life as a loving family man. Throughout the game, the player hilariously attempts to navigate day to day life as an octopus in a suit, trying and failing to perform tasks like — pour coffee, iron shirt, drive car, etc. Despite his tentacles flailing all over the house, somehow no one ever suspects his true identity.

Zim — “Invader Zim”

The Irken Empire’s most useless soldier, Zim is dispatched to Earth on a “top secret mission”. In reality, his people simply wanted to get rid of him. Once on Earth, Zim immediately decides to infiltrate the local elementary school by posing as a student, with the “foolproof” disguise of a wig and contacts. Despite his green skin, total ignorance of human behavior, weekly attempts to take over the world, and the fact that everyone clearly knows he’s an alien — Zim considers his disguise to be perfect.

The Unknown — “Dead by Daylight”

A malevolent, mysterious creature of uncertain origin, The Unknown is implied to use human mimicry to lure in potential victims. Despite having killed hundreds of people, assuming their forms as a disguise, TU can never create a mask that is not utterly horrifying.

1objjg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodySwapMemes/comments/1objjg2/amelia_goes_to_the_cafe_a_continuation_of_my_ftm/,Amelia goes to the cafe (a continuation of my FTM story),"*[Context: Amelia takes a job as a “bioform operator” for big dough.  Her boss is Logan, the stereotypical “unattractive gamer dude”.  She puts on a Bioform suit in order to transform into him and live his life on his behalf while he shirks responsibility.  Here’s a day in her life.]*

*[Ps- if you want to make it a swap, he can have a Bioform suit of her but, honestly, he doesn’t use it.  This is a sfw story.]*

Logan has informed me that he needs caffeine in order to fulfill his daily agenda, which currently includes watching reruns of Johnny Bravo, doomscrolling, and diddling himself.  Which, fair enough.  Johnny Bravo is hilarious.

Meanwhile, I’ll be standing in for him at his data entry job and morning errands.  He doesn’t need the job- the dude is a millionaire- but he says that he wants to keep it in case he loses everything and, more importantly, so that his mom will stop calling him a failure.  

(That will never happen.)

Talking to his mother is a particularly punitive form of purgatorial suffering.  Kind of like emotional water boarding, or perhaps having your fingernails ripped off.  His relationship with that woman exists exclusively through my proxy; after all, he is the son that she apparently wishes she had delivered on the table of a Planned Parenthood clinic.  Needless to say, engaging with her is a task one would *have* to be paid in order to undertake. 

Anyway, my first step is coffee.

I stand in line at the coffee shop, discreetly admiring the barista’s necklace.  (The Crown Jewels of masculinity have not quenched my admiration for pretty, shiny things.)  It’s a gorgeous pendant encrusted with small diamonds- oops, I’m next.  She and I lock eyes.  A second ago mine were firmly planted on her chest.  This doesn’t look good. 

“This fucking guy,” she mumbles, loud enough for me to hear, quiet enough for plausible deniability.  So she saw me staring, and I doubt she thinks I’m just innocently trying to distinguish between the sterling silver or white gold of her necklace.  Not while I look like *this*.  She practically barks at me, “Can I help you?”

“Um, hi.  Yeah,” I stammer, “can I just have two medium lattes please?” 

“What kind of milk?”  She crosses her arms and practically mutilates me with her glare. “Not mine, I hope.”

“Excuse me?”  Is she seriously referencing breastmilk and then insinuating that *I’m* the creepy one here?

“I saw you looking.  You’re disgusting.”  Now the people around us can hear, “Men like you…” she hisses.  I glance around to see if her coven is coming.

“Oh no.  No no no, I was actually looking at your-“  I try to clarify, but she cuts me off.

“At my *what*?”

*If you’d let me finish my sentence…*

“Your jewelry.”  I’m stuttering.  I’m sweating.  I’m trying to remember if this job came with a life insurance policy. “It’s just… that’s a really pretty necklace.”  The compliment flies through the air as a white flag; my surrender is shot down nonetheless.

“Oh, so now you’re hitting on me?”

“What?  No.”  Where did she get that idea?  “I’m not hitting on you,” I blurt.  But I don’t want her to think that I’m putting her down in any way.  “Not that you aren’t worth hitting on, I just…” *oof*, “wait, that came out wrong.”

I bury my face in my hands for a moment while she taps her pen.  She’s losing her patience. 

“It sure did.  Now.  What. Kind. Of. Milk.”

“Um.”  I deflate, keenly aware that I look like I could be on a list, and I’m pretty sure someone just took out their phone to start recording this disaster.  I want this to be over.  “Whole is fine.”

“Of course it is.”

Dripping in contempt she smirks at me as if to say “of course you want the fattiest version possible” but, I mean, it’s milk, not lard.

“You need to learn some damn respect.  Or at least be more discreet.”

The guy behind me agrees.  All too ready to become a knight in shining armor, he’s one self-help podcast away from kicking my ass.

“Yes.  Respect.  Working on that.”  Hopefully now everyone can rest assured that I know I suck and we can all move on with our day.

“Twelve-sixty-two.”

I go to slide my card and, naturally, the machine malfunctions.

“Oh Jesus, just let me do it.”  She snatches the card away.  It works instantly.  Of course it does.  “It’s going to ask you a question.”

“I’ll uh, I’ll tip extra.”  I laugh nervously.

“You better.  And keep your eyes *up* next time, Romeo.”

Right now I sort of wish Romeo and I could share the same fate.

But I’m at work.  So instead I shuffle over to the other side of the bar, keeping an eye out to ensure that my and Logan’s drinks are not, in fact, poisoned *or* drizzled with spit.

And I get it.  I’m a girl’s girl.  Us women are poked and prodded by unwelcome eyeballs from the time we can tie our shoes.  After a while it’s natural to put your guard up.  Prudent even.  A part of me shares in solidarity with the barista, proud of her assertiveness.

At the same time, being on the other end of that and innocent feels like hot garbage.  I want to cry.  Instead, I head over to Logan’s to let him know that this coffee shop is a no-go zone from now on.

Also, I think the barista gave us decaf.  Damn.",3,1760968324.0,BodySwapMemes,0,1.0,False

Set up auto-transfers on payday. Out of sight, out of temptation.

Part III – The Face in the Snow

The next morning, Evan didn’t move for a long time.

He sat in the same chair he’d been in since before dawn, staring at the space on the table where the glove had been. His coffee was cold. His breath ghosted in the thin light leaking through the frost-rimmed window.

Outside, the world looked clean and innocent again. The storm had passed, leaving everything covered in new snow, as if the night before hadn’t happened at all.

That was the part that hurt most—the way the land could erase things. Tracks, bodies, whole histories. Like it didn’t care.

When he finally stood, his joints cracked like old wood. He pulled on his parka, stepped out onto the porch, and scanned the white horizon.

The wind was gentle this morning. The only sound was the faint creak of the birch trees. But his skin prickled. He knew she—or it—was out there. Somewhere beyond the light.

He walked to the edge of the yard. Something gleamed in the snow. He crouched and brushed away the powder.

It was the glove. The same one. Red wool, a smear of black frozen blood across the palm.

It lay perfectly placed—like someone had set it there for him to find.

He looked up. The treeline was only fifty yards away, but it might as well have been a thousand. Between the trees, he thought he saw movement. A figure—slight, pale, watching. Then gone.

He stood there until the cold forced him back inside.

⸻

He didn’t go into town that day. Couldn’t. He felt tethered to the cabin somehow, like if he left, the thing that was her would follow him—drag her shadow right through the streets of Nome.

Instead, he sat by the stove, flipping through the old photo albums. Marla’s handwriting curled around the edges of the pages—“Kotzebue Trip 2016,” “Arctic Fox, West Ridge,” “Our First Winter.”

He traced her notes with his thumb. The paper smelled faintly of cedar and dust.

He remembered her voice—warm, low, full of laughter that came easy. He could almost hear it now, in the whisper of the fire.

But behind it, something else moved. A second voice, soft and wet.

“You miss me,” it said.

He froze.

“You don’t have to pretend.”

He closed the album and stood so fast the chair toppled. “You’re not her.”

The whisper didn’t stop. “I’m cold, Evan.”

He grabbed the rifle. “Stop it.”

“Please. You said you’d never leave me.”

His throat went dry.

He fired once, into the corner of the room. The blast shattered the silence, filled the air with smoke and the smell of gunpowder.

When the echo faded, the whisper was gone.

But in the wooden wall where the bullet had hit, frost spread outward from the hole, blooming like veins.

⸻

By evening, the temperature dropped twenty degrees. The world outside turned the color of lead. Evan built the fire high and sat close to it, but he couldn’t get warm. His hands shook, and when he brought them near the light, he saw his fingers were gray around the nails.

The knocking came again just after midnight.

He ignored it this time. Sat there, breathing shallow, heart pounding in his throat.

But the knocking didn’t stop.

Three knocks. Silence. Three more. A rhythm like something remembering how to be human.

Then the voice: “Evan, it hurts.”

He stood and went to the door. Not to open it. Just to listen.

The voice was closer now, trembling. “Please… let me in. I can’t feel my hands.”

He pressed his forehead to the wood. “You’re not her. You’re not Marla.”

Silence.

Then a whisper, right at the crack: “I am.”

He stepped back. His hand went to the handle. He almost turned it. Almost.

But something—a flicker of instinct, maybe love, maybe fear—stopped him.

He looked down and saw the shadow beneath the door. Bare feet. Toes too long. Nails scraping lightly on the floorboards.

He backed away, whispering, “No. No. You’re not her.”

The knocking stopped. Then, very softly:

“You left me to starve.”

The words came like a knife through his chest.

He fell to his knees. “I tried to find you! I dug for hours!”

“I called your name,” the voice said. “You didn’t come.”

He started to sob. Outside, the snow hissed against the window like breath.

When he looked up again, the shadow was gone.

⸻

The next day, he walked into Nome. He needed people, noise, anything to break the silence.

The streets were half-buried, and the sky hung low and bruised. He went straight to the library, a squat concrete building at the edge of town. Inside it smelled like dust, old books, and coffee.

The librarian, Ava Kalluk, was Inuit, mid-sixties, with silver hair braided down her back. She knew everyone’s story in Nome, though she rarely shared her own.

“Evan Holt,” she said softly when she saw him. “You look like you haven’t slept in a month.”

“Maybe longer,” he said.

He told her about the glove, the button, the voice. He didn’t say it was Marla exactly—he said “something that sounds like her.” Ava listened without interrupting.

When he finished, she stood and went to the shelf behind her desk. She pulled down a thin leather-bound book.

“You ever heard the word Wendigo?” she asked.

He nodded. “Old story. Neilson mentioned it.”

She opened the book to a page full of sketches—thin, towering creatures with hollow eyes and mouths stretched in silent screams. “It’s not just a story. Not here. We call it Ispiq, the eater of hearts. It comes from grief, from hunger too deep to fill. It remembers who it was, but only enough to hurt the ones it loved.”

Evan swallowed. “You think that’s what’s happening to me?”

Ava met his eyes. “I think you lost someone you loved. And I think something else knows that.”

He looked down at the drawings. One of them caught his attention—a woman’s shape, long hair, hands like claws, crouched over a frozen man.

“What happens if you see it?” he asked.

“You either die,” Ava said quietly, “or you join it.”

⸻

He walked home in the half-light of afternoon, her words gnawing at him. Die or join it.

When he reached his cabin, he saw new prints in the snow. Not one set this time—many. Bare, overlapping, circling the house.

And there, carved into the door with something sharp, was a single word:

HUNGER.

His stomach turned.

He opened the door and froze.

On the table, beside his letters, lay something new. A photograph.

It was one he didn’t remember taking. He was in it—kneeling beside Marla, both smiling, faces red with cold. But the edges of the photo were burned, and Marla’s eyes had been scratched out.

He dropped it. The corner brushed the stove’s edge, and for a second, he saw her reflection in the glass—standing behind him.

When he spun around, she was gone.

⸻

That night, he dreamed again.

He was back on the ridge. The snow was waist-deep, and the wind screamed in his ears. He could see her, trapped under the avalanche, her face pale and frozen, her mouth open in a soundless plea.

He reached for her hand—but when their fingers touched, her skin tore away. Bone showed through, white as the snow around them. Her lips peeled back, and her eyes opened, empty and wide.

She spoke without breath. “You let me die.”

He woke with his hand still outstretched, his fingers bleeding.

⸻

The following morning brought more bad news.

Neilson didn’t show up for work. They found his snowmobile three miles outside town, still running, headlights aimed at the trees. No sign of him. Only prints leading away—bare feet, small and many.

Sheriff Calloway came to the cabin again that night. She looked worn, anxious.

“Evan, I need you to tell me straight,” she said. “You’ve seen anything strange up here?”

He hesitated. “Depends what you call strange.”

“Neilson’s gone,” she said. “We found… pieces. Not all of him.”

He stared at her. “Pieces?”

“Frozen clean. Like something stripped him down to bone. Animals don’t do that.”

He felt the floor sway under his feet. “I told you,” he whispered. “She’s back.”

Liz’s face softened. “Ev, she’s gone. You know that.”

But he could see in her eyes that part of her believed him.

That night, she stayed until dark, sitting with him by the stove. When she left, she said quietly, “Lock your door. And if you hear her again… don’t answer.”

⸻

He didn’t.

But she came anyway.

Just before dawn, he woke to the sound of the latch turning. He reached for the rifle, but his hands wouldn’t move. The door creaked open, and the cold spilled in.

She stepped inside.

It was Marla. Her face. Her hair. Her parka—red, mended with frost.

But her eyes were wrong. They gleamed like ice under a black sun.

She smiled, teeth sharp and shining. “You left the light on,” she said in her old voice. “I came home.”

He tried to speak, but no sound came out.

She crossed the room, slow, graceful, almost shy. Her hand reached out to touch his cheek. Her skin burned with cold.

“You missed me,” she said.

He nodded before he could stop himself.

“Then don’t be afraid,” she whispered. “It’s just me.”

Her hand slid down his throat. Her fingers pressed too hard. Her nails cut skin.

He grabbed her wrist. It felt like ice-covered bone.

“Marla—”

She tilted her head. “I was so hungry.”

And then she smiled again, wider this time, until the corners of her mouth split.

⸻

When he woke, she was gone. The fire was dead, the door hanging open.

He looked at his neck in the mirror—four pale scratches running down to his collarbone.

Outside, the storm was coming back.

And for the first time, Evan knew she wasn’t haunting him.

She was hunting him.

Part IV – The Long Dark

The storm came down like a living thing.

By the afternoon of November 10th, the sky over Nome was an iron lid. Snow fell sideways, thick and furious, whipped by a wind that screamed through the power lines like something alive. The radio had gone dead sometime after noon. By evening, so had the power.

Evan’s world shrank to the cabin and the sound of the blizzard.

He built the fire high, stacked what little wood he had left, and tried not to look at the windows. The snow against the glass made it seem like the world beyond was gone, erased—no land, no sky, no time. Just white.

The silence between gusts was worse than the wind itself. In those brief moments, he could hear other things—faint steps on the porch, the low groan of the floorboards, the whisper of breath that wasn’t his own.

He hadn’t slept in two days. His eyes felt sanded raw.

Every time he closed them, he saw her face—the way she’d smiled that night in the cabin, her skin pale as death, her teeth sharp. The sound of her voice when she said, I was so hungry.

He’d locked the door, wedged a chair beneath the handle, even nailed the window frames shut. But a voice like that didn’t need doors.

⸻

He spent the second night by the stove, rifle across his lap, light from the fire painting the walls in restless orange. The wind roared, but beneath it he heard something else—faint, rhythmic.

Knocking.

Three times. Pause. Three more.

He didn’t move.

The voice followed, thin and quivering like a woman freezing outside: “Evan… please.”

He pressed the butt of the rifle against his chest, whispering to himself, “She’s not real. She’s not real.”

The voice changed, grew softer. “It hurts, Ev. I can’t feel my fingers.”

He bit his lip hard enough to draw blood.

Then, after a pause that seemed to stretch for miles: “You said you’d never leave me.”

He covered his ears. Still, he heard her.

“I waited in the dark,” she said. “I waited until I couldn’t feel the sun anymore.”

He shouted then, hoarse and broken. “You’re not her!”

The wind rose, rattling the shutters. The knocking stopped. The silence that followed felt heavier than the storm itself.

⸻

By the third day, the snow had sealed the door shut. He shoveled until his hands bled, but it only bought him inches. When he looked outside through the crack, the drifts reached halfway up the windows. He was buried alive.

The food was running out—two cans of beans, a bag of jerky, some crackers gone stale. The firewood pile had shrunk to almost nothing.

He thought about going to town, but the idea felt impossible. Nome might as well have been on the moon.

And if he left… he wasn’t sure she wouldn’t follow.

⸻

That night, he dreamed of the avalanche again, but this time he saw what happened after the snow buried her.

She was still alive.

He saw her trapped, unable to move, darkness pressing in from all sides. He saw her screaming until her voice broke, clawing at the snow until her fingers bled. And then he saw the change.

The hunger came first. Then the cold. Then something else—something slipping into her veins, ancient and patient.

When her eyes opened again, they were no longer hers.

He woke gasping, the air cold enough to hurt his lungs. The fire was dead. The window was rimed with frost, but in the ice, he saw her face.

Not reflected. Inside it.

Her eyes blinked. Her lips moved, and a sound came through the glass, faint and wet: “I found you.”

The ice cracked, spiderwebbing outward, and a thin line of blood trickled from his nose.

He stumbled back, grabbed the poker from the stove, and smashed the window. The glass exploded outward. Wind roared in, spraying snow across the room.

When the air settled, the face was gone.

But there were handprints on the windowsill—long fingers, nails black and splintered.

⸻

He tried the radio again. Static. Then, for a moment, a voice:

“…storm warning… visibility zero… remain indoors…”

Then nothing but the hiss of empty air.

He sat back and laughed—a dry, cracked sound that didn’t feel like his own.

⸻

The fourth day blurred into the fifth. The firewood was gone. He burned a chair, then his old toolbox, then the photo albums. The pictures curled and blackened, and for a second he thought he saw her face move inside the flames.

When he closed his eyes, he heard chewing. Not his. A slow, wet sound, like someone tearing meat with their teeth.

He opened them to find the glove on the floor again.

He picked it up. It was still wet. Inside was something dark and stringy.

Hair.

He dropped it and backed away. The chewing sound stopped.

From outside came laughter.

It was her laugh—light and musical, the sound that used to fill their kitchen on Sunday mornings. Except now it had an edge to it, like something scraping metal.

He pressed himself against the wall, whispering, “Please go away. Please.”

The laughter stopped. Then, after a long pause, her voice said, “Come outside, Evan. The snow’s beautiful.”

He shut his eyes tight. “You’re not real.”

“Then why are you shaking?”

He opened his eyes. She was standing at the window, her face half-hidden by hair, her lips split by a grin too wide to be human. The skin around her eyes was gone, and the bone underneath gleamed white as ice.

He fired through the glass. The recoil threw him back.

When he looked again, the window was empty. The snow outside churned like something huge was moving beneath it.

He backed away until his shoulders hit the wall. He stayed there for a long time, shaking, until the fire went out and the dark swallowed the room.

⸻

On the sixth day, the world was silent. No wind. No storm. Just the hiss of melting snow dripping from the roof.

He opened the door slowly, shovel in hand. The drifts were waist-deep, but the sky was clear—a dull, pale blue, empty.

He stepped outside.

For the first time in a week, he could see the horizon. The line of birch trees stood black against the snow, their shadows long and thin. Everything looked still.

He almost believed it was over.

Then he saw the prints.

They circled the cabin. Dozens of them. Bare feet. Some small, some large. Some human, others… not. The snow around them was stained faintly red.

He followed the trail to the edge of the trees. There, hanging from a branch, was Neilson’s hat.

Frozen to it was an ear.

He dropped the shovel.

The woods beyond were quiet, too quiet. Every instinct told him to run, but he couldn’t move. The air felt wrong—thick, buzzing, electric.

Then, somewhere deep in the trees, came a voice.

“Evan…”

It wasn’t Marla’s this time. It was Neilson’s.

“Help me,” it said. “Please.”

He turned and ran.

By the time he reached the cabin, the sun was gone.

⸻

That night, he wrote what might have been his last letter.

November 16th

If anyone finds this—Ava, Liz, whoever—you have to understand she’s not gone. She’s still out there. The thing in the snow, it’s wearing her face. And it’s hungry.

I think I’m changing too. My hands don’t feel right. My reflection looks wrong. I dream of her voice calling me from under the ice. Maybe she didn’t die alone after all. Maybe I’ll see her again soon.

He folded the letter and set it on the table beside the others. His fingers shook so badly he could barely hold the pen.

The wind picked up again around midnight. He heard her outside, walking circles around the cabin. Bare feet crunching on the snow.

Then, whispering through the walls: “Come out, Ev. You’ll be warm with me.”

He pressed his back against the door. “I can’t,” he whispered.

The voice laughed softly. “Yes, you can.”

Something heavy slammed against the door. The wood splintered. Another hit, and the nails screamed in their sockets.

He raised the rifle and aimed at the door. “Don’t make me!”

The door burst inward.

Snow and cold flooded the room. She came through like smoke—white skin, hair streaming, eyes like holes in the world. Her mouth hung open too wide, teeth glistening. Steam rose from her shoulders, her breath coming in ragged bursts.

“Ev,” she crooned. “You look tired.”

He fired. The bullet caught her in the chest. She staggered, but didn’t fall. The wound smoked, then closed, the flesh knitting together like ice reforming.

“Please,” he said. “You don’t have to do this.”

She tilted her head, her voice almost tender. “I already did.”

Then she moved.

Faster than anything human.

He fired again, missed. The rifle went flying from his hands. Her claws raked across his arm, slicing through the fabric, drawing blood.

The smell of him seemed to excite her. She leaned close, inhaled, and whispered, “You smell like home.”

He grabbed a burning log from the stove and swung. It caught her across the face, and for a moment she screamed—a high, shrill sound that made the walls shake. The smell of burning hair filled the air.

She fled back into the night, vanishing into the white.

Evan collapsed, bleeding and shaking, the log still smoking in his hand.

⸻

He didn’t remember falling asleep, but when he woke, the storm had ended.

The sun was rising—pale, thin, cruelly beautiful.

He looked at his arm. The cuts were deep, black around the edges. The skin around them looked wrong—frosted, almost translucent. When he touched it, he felt nothing.

He laughed quietly, the sound breaking halfway.

Outside, the snow glittered. Somewhere in the trees, a voice was humming—a tune he remembered from years ago. Marla’s song.

He stood slowly, wrapped his coat around himself, and opened the door.

The air was sharp as glass. The humming grew louder.

He stepped out onto the porch and whispered, “Okay, Marla. I’m coming.”

Part V – The Hunger That Remains

The morning broke like a wound.

Evan woke to a strange stillness—the kind that only comes after something terrible has passed. The storm had moved on east, leaving behind a vast, glittering silence. The world was blinding white, sharp-edged and endless. Nome lay buried somewhere beyond the horizon, smothered under six feet of snow.

The door to the cabin hung open, half-torn from its hinges. Snow had drifted inside, frosting the floor, burying his boots halfway to the ankles. His breath hung in the air, pale and fragile.

He stood there for a long time, staring at the emptiness outside. The horizon shimmered, featureless. The kind of white that swallowed sound, swallowed thought. Somewhere far off, he thought he heard the faint echo of wind—or maybe laughter.

He moved stiffly, as though something inside him had begun to freeze. The cuts on his arm had darkened to a strange gray-blue, the veins underneath branching like cracks in ice. His reflection in the stove door looked wrong—eyes too pale, lips colorless. The edges of himself felt like they were slipping away.

He didn’t need to check the clock. He could feel it in his bones: it was time to go.

⸻

He packed a small bag—rifle, spare shells, a thermos of water, what food was left. He hesitated over the letters he’d written to Marla, bound in twine. Then he stuffed them into the bag too.

If he was going to find her, she’d have to see what she’d left behind.

He stepped outside and began walking north, toward the ridge where the avalanche had taken her. The air was painfully clear, the light so bright it made his eyes water. Each step sank deep, the snow creaking like a living thing beneath his boots.

The town was nowhere to be seen, hidden under a veil of ice. The radio tower on the edge of Nome was nothing but a bent spike on the horizon. He passed the wreckage of a snowmobile half-buried in a drift—the same model Marla used. His throat tightened.

He crouched beside it and brushed the snow from the seat.

Her glove was there. The other one.

He lifted it, turned it over in his hands. Inside, something small and hard clinked against his palm—a ring.

His ring.

He closed his fist around it, feeling the cold bite into his skin. “I’m coming, Marla,” he whispered. “This ends today.”

⸻

By noon, the wind had returned—soft at first, then stronger. The temperature dropped fast. The sky darkened to the color of steel.

He reached the ridge by late afternoon. The snowpack there was different—older, denser, carved by memory. He knew every rock and hollow. This was where they’d been when it happened. He could still see her face in flashes: her goggles frosted, her laugh echoing across the valley seconds before the mountain let go.

He knelt and dug through the snow until his gloves tore. His fingers found something solid—metal, bent and cold. The remains of the snowmobile.

He kept digging.

Then his hand brushed fabric.

He froze. It was soft, half-frozen but still intact. A coat.

Marla’s.

He sat back, shaking. The sight of it made the world tilt sideways. All the months of denial and guilt and sleepless nights came crashing back in one cold rush.

He whispered, “I found you.”

The wind shifted.

And then, from behind him: “No, Evan. I found you.”

⸻

He turned.

She stood at the edge of the ridge, half-shrouded in snow fog. Her hair hung in dark, frozen strands, her eyes glowing faintly in the dusk. The thing wearing Marla’s shape smiled.

“You shouldn’t have come,” she said.

His mouth went dry. “You’re not her.”

The smile widened. “Aren’t I?”

She stepped closer. Her feet didn’t sink into the snow—they glided, light as smoke. Her voice was the same, but something underneath it crawled, something hungry and old.

“I waited for you,” she whispered. “All that time under the snow. I called your name until my throat froze.”

“You died,” he said. “I buried you.”

Her face twitched. “No. You left me.”

He raised the rifle. His hands were shaking too hard to aim. “Whatever you are, you don’t belong here.”

“Neither do you,” she said softly. “Look at yourself.”

He glanced down. His skin was almost translucent now. The blue of his veins pulsed faintly under the surface. His fingertips were pale white, the nails darkening.

He felt no pain. Just cold. Endless cold.

⸻

She circled him slowly, her voice low, intimate. “Do you know what it’s like? To starve until your body eats itself? To feel the ice crawl into your heart?”

“Stop.”

“I screamed for you, Evan. The snow pressed down and I thought, he’ll come. But you didn’t. You were warm somewhere. You forgot me.”

He fired.

The bullet tore through her shoulder. She staggered, then straightened, the wound sealing shut with a hiss of steam.

“You can’t kill what’s already dead,” she said.

He stepped back, boots slipping. “I didn’t forget.”

She tilted her head. “Then why did you let me die?”

He couldn’t answer.

The rifle felt heavy. His breath came in white bursts. Around them, the wind screamed through the valley, and in that sound, he heard other voices—dozens of them, hundreds maybe. Whispers carried on the air, calling from beneath the snow.

She spread her arms. “They’re all here with me. Every one the cold took. Every one who hungered. You can be here too.”

He said nothing.

Then she smiled again, and it wasn’t cruel—it was familiar. The same smile she’d given him on the day they moved to Nome. The same smile that made him believe the world could be kind.

“Evan,” she whispered, “come home.”

She reached out her hand.

He looked at it. At her. At the snow drifting between them like ash.

Then he lowered the rifle.

⸻

They stood in silence for a long time. The only sound was the wind, soft now, whispering across the ice.

He stepped closer. Her skin shimmered faintly, like frost under moonlight. Her eyes were deep, endless. For a moment, he could almost believe she was real again, untouched.

She placed her palm against his cheek. It was cold, but not unbearable. It felt… right.

He closed his eyes.

The hunger moved through him like a tide.

Images crashed in: her laughter, the warmth of her body, the avalanche roaring down, the sound of her screaming his name. Then something else—darkness, vast and ancient, pressing at the edges of his mind.

He saw what she had seen in the snow—the moment she stopped being human. The moment the cold whispered, Eat or die.

And she had eaten.

When he opened his eyes again, she was crying. Not blood. Not ice. Tears.

“I tried,” she said. “I tried to stay me.”

He touched her face. “I know.”

She smiled weakly. “I can’t anymore.”

He kissed her.

Her lips were ice. When he pulled back, his mouth bled. She looked at him as if apologizing. “It’s better if you let go.”

He nodded slowly.

Then he raised the rifle again.

Her eyes widened—not in fear, but in relief.

“I love you,” she whispered.

He pulled the trigger.

The sound shattered the valley.

Her body fell back into the snow. For a moment, she looked human again—her skin soft, her expression peaceful. The wind lifted her hair gently, as if tucking her to rest.

He dropped the rifle and fell to his knees beside her. His hands trembled as he brushed the snow from her face. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I should’ve been there.”

Her lips moved one last time. Maybe she said his name. Maybe it was the wind.

Then she was still.

⸻

The storm returned that night, swallowing the ridge in white.

They found the cabin weeks later—rangers from Nome, searching for survivors after the power grid failed. Inside, they found a stack of letters on the table and a body near the stove, half-frozen, a faint smile on his face.

Outside, they found two sets of tracks leading north.

Only one set returned.

November 17th

She wasn’t the monster I thought. Or maybe we both were. The hunger doesn’t come from outside—it grows in you. Starts as grief, then turns to something colder. It’s not the Wendigo that kills you. It’s the waiting.

If anyone reads this, don’t go looking in the snow. Some things aren’t meant to thaw.

⸻

The wind still howls across the tundra. Locals say sometimes, in the long dark, you can see two figures walking together out past the ridge. A man and a woman, hand in hand, their shadows stretching thin against the snow.

When the wind dies, you can hear them laughing.

Or maybe it’s just the hunger, calling for another name.",2,1760968146.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

The first shot I make comes out as expected, coffee starting to flow around 8-10s, resulting in about the volume of espresso I expect with the right duration (\~25s).It generally tastes good the way that I am used to over the last years.

When I make another shot afterwards (which in the past worked just like the first shot), using the same grind settings, the same tamper pressure, etc., I see the machine somehow struggling to get the water through the puck. Coffee starts flowing much later (around 15s) and then only with a very slight drizzle, the whole extraction takes a lot longer, 35-40s until the machine gives up, resulting in much less espresso than with the first shot - and of course it tastes a lot worse.

This behavior is fairly reproducible. I have a hard time imagining what could be happening in the machine to cause this. Of course, the parts in the machine will be warmer during the second shot, but I fail to see how this could be causing what I am observing.

Does anybody have some ideas for what is going on, what I could check, or what I could do in general to get good followup extractions again? Thanks!",1,1760968096.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

The suction’s strong enough to pull out hair that’s buried in the rug, and the dual brushes spin both ways so it doesn’t get tangled.

1objawl,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1objawl/is_my_work_situation_toxic/,Is my work situation toxic?,"Hi! So, I'm navigating a new dynamic at work. It feels violent and toxic to me, but I don't know, I'd like to have other opinions on the situation! :) 

So, here we go: 

Coworker A is my friend, outside of work. They started dating coworker B. We are very small team (5 employees, 1 manager).

At the beginning of their relationship, coworker A and B were figuring things out, but they often did it at work. They were angry at each other; there was some tension. Sometimes they were happy, and they made sexual jokes and stuff like that. I personally found it difficult.

Now, coworker B is starting to hate their job (they say it out loud at work, everyday), and they start to be irritable. Coworker B was condescending and hostile a couple of times towards me this summer. They are not doing a good job, objectively, and I think they know it, even though the entire team is protecting them, and saying nothing. So, when things got difficult a few months ago, they snapped at me a couple of times, for no reason. I started to feel unsafe at work, because I don’t know when coworker B will get mad.

I have been avoiding disagreeing with coworker B for a while now. Even when we talk about unimportant things (by that I mean, for example, talking about films or food), I try to agree with them no matter what, because I’m afraid they could get angry.

Two weeks ago, we were talking about a TV show, and coworker B thought I was disagreeing with them. While I was speaking, they interrupted me, saying “I don’t care”. I saw they were getting mad, so I tried to de-escalate the situation and tell them I was actually agreeing with them. I didn’t have time to do that. Coworker B just left the room, angry (leaving the lunch bag and their plate behind), and they slammed their office door. Another co-worker was there when it happened, and we stayed there together a while, trying to process what had happened. We felt it was very violent.

Now, coworker B is saying hello, but they are not talking to me about anything else. We used to get coffee together, now we don’t. I mean, I don’t mind not being friend with coworker B and all. But coworker B is dating my friend coworker A, so, it’s a delicate situation.

For this reason, I’m not sure I want to talk to my boss. I mean, I told my boss about the summer tension, and he told me: “yeah, I noticed that”. And? He did nothing. He’s not the most proactive person! The situation is very difficult, because it is a small team, and 2 coworkers are dating, and one is a friend.

I am unfortunately familiar with abuse, and violence, but not at work, this is very new to me. So, I guess my question is: am I exaggerating here, or is coworker B behaving poorly? And, considering the situation, would it be a good idea to talk to my boss, or HR?

I only need a few hours of time to get my work done. Most people in my industry start earlier around 7 and his start around 9, so that time in the morning is the perfect time for me to work and him to take care of baby.

I scramble out of bed without getting ready to call into my morning meeting and focus on work. However I like taking care of baby in the morning so I call into my meeting and get he dressed in the background. My husband doesn't get up. I make coffee and spend time with her. He finally gets up, but has to shower and get ready. Comes downstairs and always wants to make breakfast or pickup breakfast. I am very appreciative of this but it ends up in an argument every morning. Because by the time he can sit down to eat, the baby needs to nap and she is fussing, he's annoyed he can't eat a hot breakfast. I'm annoyed because now 2 hours is gone that I could be nearly wrapped up for the day. And then at that point I can work when convenient, during naps etc. He says oh well she can fuss for a minute but no I don't think she should when we are both home. It is difficult for me to listen to her cry or fuss, obviously as a mom it is an instinct for us.

We always end up arguing on my remote days and I hate it. They are supposed to be special days I get to spend with my baby but they always end up in arguments and stressful. I refuse to go in on these days and hate that it would make things less stressful for her to be with the sitter. I have this arrangement to have more time with my daughter and I really don't like to work when she is awake.

My husband probably has this same routine on days when no one is home, but I'm happy eating a protein bar and tried to explain that nicely before he started making breakfast. I can see how this turns out every time and know something from the routine needs to be changed, and its the delayed shower, getting ready and breakfast routine of his. It stresses me out that he gets annoyed that by the time he sits to eat she needs a nap but its been 2 hours! He's always saying how he can help too but in that moment I feel like I'm being made to feel guilty about it. Now he says I'm ungrateful and other women would kill for this, and so on. 

I just hate that it turns into the hardest days. Everyone thinks working from home is so easy at my job. It's all men in my field. No one gets it. Am I an asshole to my husband?",0,1760967698.0,workingmoms,16,0.25,False

The idea was interesting a cafe in Tokyo where you can travel to the past or future as long as your coffee doesn’t get cold, but the execution didn’t match the promise. 
The concept had great potential but the stories and characters just didn’t hit deep, the second half was more emotional and serious but still couldn’t make up for the overall dull pace.

I wanted to share something that worked surprisingly well when I was tackling a few old coffee and shoe stains on my carpet this weekend. The stains had been there for months, and normal soap and water didn’t really do much.

Here’s what ended up helping:

1. **Warm water + mild detergent:** I mixed a small amount of dish soap in warm water and used a clean white cloth to gently blot (not rub) the stain.
2. **Baking soda lift:** After it dried a bit, I sprinkled baking soda over the area, left it overnight, and vacuumed it the next morning.
3. **Carpet tile refresh:** I had a couple of removable carpet squares from All Flooring Now in that section, and surprisingly, they held up well through the cleaning and didn’t lose color or texture.

No harsh chemicals, and the carpet looks and feels way better now. I’m curious, what methods do you all use for stubborn stains without damaging the fibers?",1,1760967325.0,CarpetCleaning,1,1.0,False

In my experience, it keeps making characters drink drinks they don't even have. They are drinking drinks they have never bought or picked up from somewhere during the roleplay. It is randomly spawning drinks for the characters to drink.

Coffee is the one it seems to pick the most, but it has also been doing that with whiskey, water, and soda.

It’d make sense if they were at a restaurant setting or somewhere that serves food, and maybe the ai could forget what was ordered, or it could make an assumption that it has a drink because of the location, but it's happening at the museum, police station, doctor's office, and outside.

During conversation, the character randomly takes a sip of coffee or some other drink. Then maybe 4 messages later, it has another sip of that drink or another type of drink.

If it happened every once in a while, I could ignore it, but it happens very frequently, and it happens in locations where it makes no sense.

It’s like, “Sir, where did you get that coffee?! We are in the middle of the woods!”

Did the ai realize something like “humans drink drinks, so I must frequently drink drinks to accurately pretend to be human”?

But taking just a moment to pause and acknowledge the good things—no matter how small—can be a total game-changer.

​Gratitude isn't just a nice feeling; it's a practice that can actually rewire your brain, boosting happiness and resilience. It shifts your perspective from lack to abundance, making the tough days a little easier to bear and the good days shine even brighter.

​You don't need a grand reason to be grateful. It can be the hot cup of coffee, the warmth of a jacket, the laughter of a friend, or simply the ability to take a deep breath.

​Try this today: Before the days gets too busy, name three things you are genuinely thankful for. Just three. It's a small shift that can lead to a huge impact.

​What's one thing you're grateful for right now?

Runna had my predicted finish time between 3:58–4:10, and I truly believed that was realistic.

Race morning started like usual — sourdough with peanut butter, banana, and honey, plus LMNT, water, and coffee. My stomach felt a bit queasy (maybe nerves?) and I “emptied the tank” a few times before heading out. Not unusual bowel movements but also not completely normal for me either? (Sorry for the TMI)

The race started at 8:00, but my corral didn’t cross the start line until 8:40, so my warm-up went completely out the window. We were packed in so tight I could barely move my legs.

I set off with the 4:10 pacer, but he started way too fast for my liking, so I backed off, figuring I’d catch him later once he realized how quick his splits were.

The first 10K went great — it flew by. Then around 12K, everything changed. My stomach started cramping so badly it felt like a knife stabbing me right in the middle. I could barely get myself to take in any gels or even sip water. I don’t know if it was because I was on my period or what, but my period cramps have never been that bad.

I managed to hang on until about 22K, but by then I was in tears. I knew I needed to fuel but couldn’t force anything down. By 28K, I threw up and collapsed from leg cramps and what I’m assuming was dehydration.

The paramedics came over and called for a pickup car. I knew a DNF was probably in my future. My calves were completely locked — they were literally holding my legs trying to stop the muscles from seizing. After a couple of minutes, the cramping finally eased. I stood up, looked at them, and said I’d walk to the next water station and see how I felt from there.

And that’s what I did — with the help of a stranger’s water bottle, spectators handing me Gatorade, and even a tangerine from a biker, I made it the 2km to the next aid station. My legs locked again and I basically froze there, hunched over while people kept asking if I was okay. I stood for a couple of minutes, then somehow hobbled off again.

After that, it was a blur. I shuffled, walked, cried, and somehow ran the last 14km to the finish line.

Final time: 5:55. Half split: 2:02.

I was right on track for my B goal (4:30) before everything fell apart. I’m proud I finished, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed — or even a bit embarrassed. I know I can do so much better. Race day just didn’t go my way.

I cried more at the end because now… well I have to do it again 🥲 redemption season.

**NEW YORK, NY**

I had 10 minutes before my next meeting. I quickly finished the rest of my coffee and beckoned to Allie. “Let’s head back…”

Allie frowned but said nothing. Her silence told me enough — she didn’t appreciate her break being cut short. She was one of my oldest friends. There weren’t many left. The recent lay-offs had been hard on my team.

My phone buzzed as soon as I entered the office. The board was already meeting and wanted me to present the quarterly figures. As I walked down the corridor toward the meeting room, I glanced outside. The parking lot below was empty except for my car — brand new, expensive. It used to be my pride and joy. Now it was just a reminder of how quickly things had turned. Beyond the gates, the park was alive — people laughing, basking in the rare Sunday sun.  None of it cheered me up. I pressed the button which motored the blinds down over the windows.

Nothing could brighten my mood today, not even the glorious sun outside.

**Ilaveezhapoonchira, KER**

I had 10 minutes before rain would pour down. The ominous grey clouds signalled impending thunderstorms.  
“Here, boy — inside!” I called.

Boomer barked in protest, then trotted after me up the hill. I’d found him as a pup years ago, and he’d been my companion ever since. The first drops hit just as we reached the shack — Radio Station 23, my post and my home.

The old wooden structure creaked in the wind, surrounded by tall steel towers that doubled as lightning rods. Rains were already lashing against the boarded up windows. I could see flashes of lightning through the cracks in the boards. Boomer snuggled next to me under the table .. showing his displeasure with small whines. Rain hammered the boards as I sealed the shutters. Lightning flashed through the cracks. Boomer curled up under the table, making sure to show his displeasure with small whines I patted his head and picked up the receiver.

“Station 23 reporting — heavy rains, expected through the night. Line is clear. Over.”

I set the receiver aside as similar acknowledgements started streaming in from the other stations. I glance up at the wall-clock. It was 9PM. I walkover to the makeshift kitchen, and poured some soup into two bowls. I left the bigger bowl for Boomer.. He was a small dog , but he had a big appetite. As I eat, I rummage through the drawers and gather up all the money left over. A quick calculation cheers me up.. I had just enough to get some rice and meat.

“Hey Boomer, we will buy some mutton tomorrow...”

Boomer, pauses slurping down his soup momentarily to lick my hand. He always appreciated mutton. The rain roared, but I barely noticed. I stretched out on the mattress, novel in hand. Boomer settled against my legs.

They don't need to have wifi as I have my own hotspot, but I also don't want to walk in somewhere to start working and get some weird stares. 

Some necessities are:

On the West side 
Ample seating and space
Good savory food options in shop or within walking distance
Cozy 
Lots of outlets 

Some stuff that's nice to have are:

Wide selection of teas
Easy parking 
Garden area? (Idk just sounds nice)


I know similar things have been asked before but when I look at the threads there are a lot of recommendations on the East side and I would rather not have to drive too long. Thanks!

So I am not a well travelled person, so I have no idea what I'm doing, hopefully I will be let into the country and won't die.

- I will be flying out of frankfurt on wednseday at 8pm, landing in Bejing thursday afternoon. I'll head out into the city and will drink some coffee and eat some dinner, walk around. Then off to the airport so I'll be there at 11pm, because my flight to melbourne will be at 1am
- arrive in melbourne friday afternoon, take the skybus to the city, tram to the hostel where I will check into my solo room.
- Spend the weekend in melbourne, maybe just coffee, brunch, bars, maybe some live music?
- Monday I would like to do a day trip, maybe an old gold town or wildlife sanctuary
- tusday morning I would like to start heading out to the great ocean road until thursday night. Not sure how or where or what, but that sounds nice

- Thursday checking into a hotel in melbourne, and friday going to the concert in marvel stadium

- saturday I wanna head out until wednesday to somewhere in nature. maybe grampians, maybe tassie, maybe something else

- Wednsday my flight home will be going out at 8pm, so 5 pm at the latest I wanna check in with my flights

1obiy8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frasier/comments/1obiy8n/the_cranes_critique/,The Crane's Critique,"Each week I'm going to take an episode from our beloved series and attempt to dissect it and scruntise it to the best of my ability

Any specific theories, Symbolism, Allegory, Metaphor are most welcome

To be concise and for the sake of brevity, I'm going to limit my thoughts to 200 words (with scope for more). This is a participatory exercise so others thoughts, opinions and analysis is also much appreciated. This isn't meant to be a perfect summary of how each scene transpired - but more of an overall reflection of what the episode 'says' to this viewer

This week I'm going to start with THE 1000th SHOW. In my opinion, a key and pivotal episode in the development of Frasier Crane


""Frasier gets the day he wants - a manifestation of his commitment and devotion to KACL over the past 5 years. But rather than delight in its celebration, Frasier subtlety attempts to control proceedings. The sarcastic ""low-key, tasteful......public rally"" as a contrast to Roz's more muted plans speaks volumes about his character. He wants HIS day, but strictly on HIS terms

All the usual tropes of a Frasier episode are here. Niles's witticisms and put downs and the back and forth banter between both siblings are fully present at Nervosa - with Frasier's ""seven snobs a sniping"" getting a particular laugh from this viewer. A fantastic retort. We luxuriate in the brothers getting a coffee ""to go"" while they stroll across downtown Seattle. Niles's  barely-concealed jealousy about his brothers fame and public adulation doesn't stand in the way of an astute observation""

""Top tip, the ones waving back to you are tourists, they have no idea who you are - much less, ..why you're listening.

From here, we are treated to many scenes which accurately portray Frasier's impending doom as the realisation that he might miss HIS DAY grow ever closer. The accidental pouring of ""latte on his suede shoes"" from an erratic Niles, the incessant need to try on every pair of shoes - even ""the managers"", as his temper shortens - and the appalling distraction of a blind jazz musician while they steal a quarter - culminating in the Crane's fleeing the scene amidst an on rushing group of schoolchildren""

Now both are bereft (and exhausted) of options,
with the 'Day' only minutes away from commencing. We see a glimmer of hope on the Mono-Rail, but this is forlorn. A clever piece of word play with a staff member perfectly encapsulates his perilous situation (""Well I suppose its not your day"". ""BUT IT IS MY DAY!). Now as the audience, we feel real empathy for Frasier. Through a serious of circumstances (which are partially his own doing) Frasier is metaphorically let down by Seattle when it's most needed. He is primarily the architect of his own downfall, but as the protagonist and the cornerstone of this episode - the realisation that he finally, once and for all, won't be at his own celebration hits this viewer deeply""


*That's all I've got at the moment. I'll add some more later in the day when I have the time (and energy!) as I would like to add a comprehensive paragraph or two about Frasier's taxi ride and what that symbolises and what it truly represents about his character*

1obixqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1obixqm/sp_beyond_good_and_evil/,[SP] Beyond Good and Evil,"# I. Father Elias

Luke was living on autopilot in a world that felt increasingly artificial.

He woke up at the same hour every drizzly morning, went to work boarding the same gray carriage on the monotonous subway, and, once seated uncomfortably behind his plastic desk at work, typed lists of numbers into an Excel sheet that never seemed to end. He wasn’t even entirely sure why he was doing it, truth be told.

On one particularly dreary morning, still recovering from a company “team-building exercise” that had only deepened the hatred he already felt for his colleagues, he stared at the office clock and wondered if time had quietly marched on without bothering to inform him. The hours blurred together, indistinguishable and cloudy. Sometimes he would catch himself performing an action before realizing he’d already done it; sending the same email twice, greeting the same coworker in identical words. And, all the while, a strange sense of déjà vu stalked him like a shadow, whispering that he had done this all before.

As he was heading home that night, on a whim that was entirely unbecoming of his character, Luke exited the subway one stop early and decided to roam the streets of Grayhaven to explore a little. He couldn’t remember the last time he did something unexpected and this small act of rebellion against his tyrannical habits seemed to lighten his mood ever so slightly.

The city wasn’t much to look at: a labyrinth of steel and shadow. Sleek black towers loomed over squat concrete blocks, their glass skins bleeding streaks of neon that shimmered in puddles below. Holographic ads flickered against the low clouds, selling things no one could afford to people too numb to care. A sluggish, polluted river cut through the financial district like a vein filled with oil. From the residential zones ten blocks away, smoke coiled lazily upward, mixing with the drizzle until sky and smog were indistinguishable. Somewhere in the distance, police sirens wailed; a war cry part of the city’s mechanical pulse.

Luke pulled his coat tighter and watched a pink sign blink uncertainly above a noodle bar: **LIVE A LITTLE**. Its reflection quivering in the water at his feet.

“Still better than the usual way home,” he thought.

Before long, however, the skies opened up, swallowing the bleak city in a blanket of water.

Luke ducked into an old stone church to escape the torrential rain. The heavy wooden door groaned as he pushed it open, and the sound of the storm outside dulled to a distant hum. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of incense and old wood, with candles flickering along the narrow aisles, their wax pooled in uneven heaps and casting trembling halos of gold on the stone walls. The place was smaller than he expected, an intimate nook as though built more for confession than ceremony.

He walked slowly toward the front, his footsteps echoing faintly on the cobblestone floor. The pews were empty, dust motes drifting through the dim light and a single stained-glass window glowed faintly with the last rays of evening light, its colors warped by the rain outside.

It felt, strangely, like the church had been waiting for him, like a room that somehow remembers who you are. And there, seated near the altar, was a man in a threadbare cassock, his hands folded loosely in his lap, his white beard reaching down towards his chest, his eyes sharp and curious, almost amused. Father Elias smiled faintly. “You look like a man who’s come in from more than just the rain,” he said, his eyes alight with an impish sense of humour.

And there it was again! Luke felt the strange pull of déjà vu wash over him.

“You ever wonder why God made the world?” Father Elias asked, getting straight to the point.

Luke was taken a little aback by the abruptness of the question.

“Uh… because He was bored?” he retorted, half-jokingly.

Father Elias laughed a good-natured laugh, a peal which reverberated in the tiny space.

“Close enough,” Father Elias said, smiling. “He made it to not be God for a while. To forget what He is. To play.”

Luke chuckled, and the priest beamed at him, his enthusiasm infectious.

“You see,” Father Elias continued, “God is everywhere all at once; which means that he’s nowhere at the same time. He knows everything that there is to know too, which means nothing surprises Him; perfection is the most unbearable prison of all.”

Luke felt like he was in a dream where something strange was happening, yet, weirdly, he accepted it without too much thought.

“In order to truly experience reality, the Father continued, “He split Himself in two: Subject and Object. Light and Dark. Night and Day. The whole circus. And that’s exactly why and how The Game began.”

Before Luke could ask what game, the priest added: “But remember: **if the players all wake up at once, the game ends.** And there are... those who won’t let that happen.”

A sharp flash of lightning struck as soon as the priest ended his speech, and Noah jumped, startled at the timing. He turned towards the stained glass window to watch the raindrops pelting it.

“But why are you telling…” Luke was about to say, turning back round to face the Father, before stopping.

Father Elias was no longer there.

# II. Waking Up

Weeks had passed since that night in the church, yet the memory lingered like a half-remembered dream Luke couldn’t quite shake. He tried to dismiss it by telling himself that Father Elias really had been there speaking to him and that he wasn’t some ghostly apparition; but there was something strange about the whole night that shook him.

“*If the players all wake up at once, the game ends*.”

The sentence replayed in his mind like a broken record. What the hell did it mean?! And who were the “ones” who wouldn’t let that happen? They wouldn’t let the Game end; but what in the world was the Game?!

He began spending his evenings online, trawling through obscure forums on the internet for anything remotely related to “The Game.” Curiosity soon spiraled into obsession; he read everything from mystical treatises and ancient scriptures to fringe blogs on simulation theory and cosmic consciousness. Before long, one ubiquitous pattern started to emerge: **the idea that reality was an illusion, a divine stage play, a dream God had cast Himself into**.

The Hindus called this Maya, the cosmic illusion of separateness that veils the true, eternal reality (known as Brahman.) The Buddhists spoke of Samsara, the experience of being trapped inside the illusion of the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. The Gnostics spoke of Yaldabaoth, the demiurge, the flawed creator of the material realm that trapped humanity within a false reality. To the mystical Muslims, the Sufis, the world is a veil (a hijab) that hides the true, unitary face of God. The Daoist mystic Zhuangzi once dreamed that he was a butterfly… before asking whether he was actually a butterfly dreaming he was a man. Plato spoke of the shadows on the cave wall, and modern-day adherents to this ancient stream speak of the simulation theory.

Luke came to see that this was very likely what Father Elias was referring to; he was probably referring to the cosmic Game of Life that we’re all playing. But what about “those who won’t let the game end”? Luke was stumped.

At work, he found it increasingly difficult to concentrate; his once indifferent coworkers now regarded him with wary amusement. They whispered behind his back after he’d begun talking, half in jest, half in earnest, about “the veil” and “the Game.”

His girlfriend, Maya, tried to be patient at first, but when Luke began filling their apartment with books on gnosticism, hermeticism, and quantum consciousness, and shifting every single conversation towards “illusions” and “the blind masses,” she packed her things and left. “You’re not searching for truth, Luke,” she’d said. “You just want to be the hero. You want to feel special.” Her words stung more than he cared to admit. But the more people tried to divert the conversation away from matters of ultimate concern, the more adamant he became that this was his path in life to take.

He soon started to see synchronicities in his life. He’d see the same graffiti scrawled across opposite ends of the city: a serpent devouring its tail, an equilateral triangle enclosing an eye, and beneath it, the same phrase in block capitals: KEEP PLAYING. The same symbol appeared in advertisements, in his dreams, even in the corner of his spreadsheet at work when the numbers misaligned for no apparent reason.

“Why have I never noticed these details before?” he wondered.

One night, while following a trail of links through yet another obscure chat board that dated back to the early days of the internet more than sixty years ago, Luke stumbled upon a forum speaking about **The Order of the Silver Moon** whose members spoke with near-religious fervor about tearing down “the illusion”; they believed humanity had been deliberately kept asleep, its consciousness suppressed through media, food, education, and technology by **The Order of the Black Sun**, a hidden network of elites guarding the secrets of existence for their own selfish purposes.

At first, Luke assumed the group was long defunct, one of those forgotten digital relics from a wilder, weirder era. But then he noticed a hidden hyperlink tucked into one of the old threads and a lightbulb went off in his head; he found a doorway to a current chatroom! To his astonishment, the messages there were recent, some only a day or two old. Whatever these Orders were, they were still alive it seemed.

He scrolled through the latest posts, eyes darting across the glowing screen. Everything was being denounced: usury, fluoride, the education system, the farcical theatre that passed for politics, the pharmaceutical industry, the endless wars, the media echo chambers, the algorithms that shaped desire, the chemicals in the food, the blue light from screens, the noise, the debt, the empty promises of progress, the gatekeepers. Each was framed as part of a grand design to keep humanity docile, distracted, and most importantly, asleep.

He spent hours glued to the screen, soaking up every fragment of theory and debate like a sponge. He couldn’t get enough. For the first time in his life, he felt a strange sense of belonging. The others spoke the same language, shared the same unease with the world.

The members of the Order of the Silver Moon called themselves **the Luminaries**, and their mission was clear: to liberate humanity from its cosmic slumber. One of the most prolific commenters, who went by the handle u/LunarOmega, posted cryptic messages late at night:

“*The world is not broken. It’s working exactly as intended. Its purpose is to break you. Your sacred task, should you choose to accept it, is to break the world first.”*

*“Remember who You are. You are not your little self with its fears and regrets. You are the paper upon which the story is written. You are the story itself. You are the grand unveiling of the Universe’s deepest secret.”*

The Order of the Silver Moon.

The Order of the Black Sun.

The Eternal Game.

The never-ending Dance.

At last, Luke thought, he had an answer, at least a partial one, to Father Elias’s warning: these were the ones who would never let the Game end. And, conversely, these were the ones who were *trying* to end the Game.

But if the Black Sun existed to keep the Game going... then what did that make him? He stared at the first line of u/LunarOmega’s message, now pulsing faintly on his screen, as if alive:

*“Your sacred task, should you choose to accept it, is to break the world first.”*

In that moment, Luke realized what he had to do.

# III. A Calling

“You see, there’s a difference between the Orders,” typed the user with the handle u/NeoAwakensAgain88. “The Black Sun operates entirely in the darkness because they don’t want people, even those who are sound asleep, to know what they’re doing. In other words, people can tell right away that what they’re doing is wrong. But us? We operate in the darkness because people don’t really understand what it is we’re doing. It’s not wrong, just misunderstood.”

It had been a couple of weeks since Luke had stumbled upon this most astonishing of open secrets, and he was still struggling to grasp the enormity of what he’d found. He was being lectured by some anonymous figure online who claimed allegiance to the Silver Moon.

“The problem,” the stranger continued, “is that most people are in a deep state of unconsciousness, and you can’t seem to rouse them. Even if we tell them the whole truth, they’re in such a deep state of slumber that they’ll dismiss everything that you say! The reason this sleep persists is because there’s a constant negative frequency being transmitted across the radio waves, television sets, the virtual internet, all over, designed to keep them trapped in fear and ignorance. And fear and ignorance are really just two sides of the same coin. If you keep people afraid, they’ll never want to learn anything new. And the less they learn, the more they fear what they don’t understand. It’s a perfect loop, a self-reinforcing prison.”

“The only way to counteract the frequency,” the user continued, “is through resonance. The Moon carries a different light that’s not as harsh as the raw, burning light of the Sun; it’s reflected. It’s softer, subtler. Our work is to restore the rhythm that was lost. To make the world remember what it is.”

Luke hesitated before typing his next question: “But how do you wake people up if they’re sound asleep and ignore every word you say?”

“That’s the hard part,” came the reply. “You have to speak to their *subconscious* mind. Say too little, and the message is lost; but say too much, and they notice and reject it. People have a kind of mental immune system trained to defend the illusion. Anything that strays too far from the norm, they’ll push it away automatically. But if you drip feed them the truth subconsciously, it’s occasionally enough to make them wake up.”

Luke reread the message several times. Not too forceful but just forceful enough. And it was all about the right resonance.

Resonance.

That last word stayed with him and, over the following weeks, his life quietly rearranged itself around the Order’s teachings. He stopped showing up to work. His apartment filled with printed diagrams of sigils, spells, network maps, diagrams, posters, and old circuit boards scavenged from junk markets. He began to meditate for the first time in his life and the glow of his monitor became his moonlight, guided as he was by the promise of digital salvation.

At first, he was only an observer in the chatrooms, watching the Luminaries exchange cryptic instructions and lunar calendars but before long came the “tests of faith”: small tasks designed to make sure that he was on the right path towards righteousness.

His first task involved rewriting snippets of code for a multinational streaming platform, embedding hidden messages that would flicker onscreen for less than a second:

You are dreaming.

Wake up.

The Order of the Black Sun are watching.

Most viewers never even noticed, but a few did and posted blurry screenshots online on various message boards, asking others if they had also seen the same. The Luminaries called it a sign that the Veil was thinning.

Next came the “lucidity tone” experiment. Luke’s task was to place a piece of audio containing a subsonic pulse said to disrupt the Black Sun’s control frequency. The file was disguised as a meditation track and uploaded under dozens of aliases on various streaming platforms. Soon enough, after Luke had placed the track, reports poured in of people claiming they saw faces behind their eyelids and lights pulsing in the walls. Some said they felt more alive than ever; others said they couldn’t sleep.

Another tiny victory for the Silver Moon.

Luke’s training continued this way for months as he grew accustomed to the Order’s methods and to the quiet thrill of subversion. He helped publish a trove of leaked documents from an anonymous group of hackers, hinting at government research into mind-control techniques. He assisted in developing a new guided meditation app which the Luminaries artificially boosted to the top of the charts. And through it all, Luke’s conviction deepened: he no longer doubted the mission. They were the good ones; the bearers of the softer light, the hidden architects of awakening.

He couldn’t help but feel that they were succeeding.

# IV. Three Knocks

It was nighttime and Luke sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, the glow of the desk lamp faintly illuminating the mess of scattered papers and half-drained mugs of cold coffee. The air was heavy with stillness, save for the soft hum of the city outside and the muted hiss of rain against the window. He was rereading his notes from that first encounter in the church, tracing the underlined phrases with the tip of his pen.

It had been several months since he started his ‘tests of faith’ and, barring a few tiny setbacks, all seemed to be going according to plan. Despite everything he had been through, he always found himself coming back to the question posed by Father Elias.

He took a look at his notes again, falling on those eternal words:

>

He mouthed the words soundlessly, as though reciting a mantra. The rain deepened. He could almost hear Father Elias’s voice again, calm and steady, as thunder rolled distantly over Grayhaven. A single thought slipped through his mind, quieter than a whisper but sharp enough to cut through the haze: *Who was it that was doing the ‘remembering’?*

He leaned back in his chair, exhaled, and let out a half-hearted sigh. Ever since that fateful night at the church, he had pondered his existence and wondered what the hell it was really all about. If he was God, forgetting and remembering, then would he even *want* to wake up at all? And if he woke up, wouldn’t he go straight back to sleep to remember everything again anyway?

He rubbed his temples and closed his eyes, trying to push the tangled knot of thoughts away from his awareness.

That was when the knock came. Three sharp raps that echoed through the small apartment like tiny bullets.

It was 11 o’clock at night, no visitors should ever knock past 9: that was a well-known rule that even Luke knew. The clock on the wall ticked once… and then seemed to stop. He stood up slowly, cautiously, heart pounding in his chest. The air felt charged with a crackle of electricity.

Three more knocks.

He moved toward the door and pressed his eye to the peephole where he saw two tall men dressed in black suits, with sunglasses and wide-brimmed Indiana Jones-style hats, standing in the hallway. Rainwater dripped from their shoulders onto the floor, collecting around their polished shoes. They didn’t move. They didn’t seem to breathe either.

“Mr. Luke,” one of them said. His voice was calm, toneless, the kind of voice that you heard through a muffled tannoy system. “We need you to come with us.”

Luke hesitated, his fingers hovering over the lock.

“Who are you?” he managed to ask, his voice cracking slightly.

No response. The man simply repeated the sentence, word for word, in the exact same cadence: “Mr. Luke, we need you to come with us.”

Luke took a step back. The air in the hallway shimmered faintly, as if heat were warping it. The lights flickered.

He opened his mouth to shout, to demand an explanation, but before he could speak, the bulb above him popped, plunging the room into total darkness. A wave of vertigo washed over him, and the floor seemed to tilt. He reached out for the table to steady himself but his hands found nothing.

He crashed to the floor, a wave of nausea rushing over him. And just before his eyelids drooped shut, he saw a crack of light appear as the door opened just a peep to let the light from the hallway into the darkened space.

“Who are…” he began to say before drifting into the abyss.

# V. Revelation

Luke woke to find himself sitting upright on an uncomfortable plastic chair in a blindingly white room.

“Where…?” he murmured groggily. His head lolled from side to side, and a low moan escaped his lips, as though he were a video game character whose player was still fumbling with the controls.

“Don’t worry,” said a calm, deep voice. “Nothing bad will happen to you here, I promise.”

Luke cracked one eye open, half-blinded by the brightness. At the far end of a wooden table sat a man, or perhaps something more than a man, who was, without exaggeration, the most beautiful person Luke had ever seen. His features were paradoxical, balanced perfectly between masculine and feminine: a sharp, square jaw with just enough stubble to frame his face, wide dimples, and striking blue eyes soft as silk beneath long lashes. His nose was thin and elegant, his presence unsettlingly radiant.

“My name is Solas,” the man said, his voice rich and measured. “I’ll give you a few moments to wake up. Here, drink some water. I told my men to handle you carefully. I hope they did.”

Solas smiled gently as he slid a glass of water across the table. Luke eyed it warily, debating whether to trust it. But he reasoned that if Solas had wanted to harm him, he already would have. He took a cautious sip, then another, until the glass was empty.

“Who are you? And why did you take me?”

Solas tilted his head, amused.

“You mean you can’t figure that out for yourself?”

“Uh… no.”

“You’re a clever man, Luke. We’ve been watching you for some time, ever since Father Elias had that little ‘word’ with you, however many months ago that was. But there’s still something you haven’t quite grasped.”

Solas rose from his chair and began to wander slowly around the room. Luke’s eyes followed him, and only now did he begin to take in his surroundings. The place was a kind of underground chamber; one wall was bare brick and the other was coated with cracked plaster that peeled at the corners. A row of fluorescent strip lights hummed faintly overhead, bathing everything in a pale, artificial glow. The only decoration was a single painting hanging slightly askew on the wall. Luke squinted; ‘The Starry Night’ by Van Gogh. Or something like it.

Solas stopped before the painting, hands clasped behind his back.

“I told him to paint it in red to show the sunrise. I’ve always preferred the morning to the night,” he said absently. “But he insisted on keeping it blue. People like this version better, I suppose.”

Luke frowned, unsure who he meant by “him”. Solas’ tone was wistful, as if speaking to someone long gone and, after a few moments, he turned back towards Luke, his eyes gleaming with a mischievous light.

“You think they’re the bad guys, don’t you?” he said.

Luke blinked. “Who?”

“Oh, come now. Don’t play coy with me. The Order of the Black Sun. You despise them, don’t you?”

At the mention of the name, Luke stiffened and his pulse quickened. Was Solas admitting he was one of them? Their leader, perhaps? Or something worse? He’d only ever known the Black Sun as rumor and silhouette, the faceless architects behind everything the Luminaries opposed. Now one of “them” was standing across from him, smiling like an old friend.

“Why wouldn’t I despise them?” Luke snapped. “You’re keeping people in cages!”

Solas smiled faintly at the outburst. He let the silence hang, long enough to make it uncomfortable, before breaking into a low, almost musical laugh. Luke stared, incredulous.

“Let me help you understand the little *fact* you haven’t quite grasped yet,” Solas said, his tone light, almost playful. “You need the Order of the Black Sun to keep existing. You can’t bear to get rid of us, because if that ever happened, your life, your entire *purpose*, would collapse.”

Luke blinked, stunned. “What? No! That’s ridiculous! You keep people trapped because it benefits you; because you want more and more and it’s never enough! You’re parasites, and you’re just as blind as the people you’re keeping in the dark!”

Solas’ smile didn’t waver. If anything, it deepened.

“Let’s put it another way,” he said softly. “If everyone remembered who they truly are, the *game* would end. No pain, no suffering. Yes? But then also: no laughter, no desire, no love. No *stakes*. Do you understand yet? Nonduality is nonexistence.”

He began pacing slowly behind Luke, his voice echoing slightly in the sparse room.

“God made this world to *not* be God for a while. To feel something *real*. If everyone woke up, there’d be no tension, no struggle, no movement, no time. And remember why this realm was created? To *experience* life. But life cannot be experienced without difference; without tension, struggle, movement, or time.”

Luke shook his head violently. “What are you talking about? No, no, no! That can’t be right!”

Solas laughed again, quietly this time, the sound reverberating in the still air.

“Oh, but it is,” he said, almost tenderly. “It’s like vision. When everything is perfectly still, you can’t *see* anything because everything blends together. Movement or contrast is what allows sight in the first place. And existence works the same way. Without villains, without conflict, there is no story. Without obstacles, there’s nothing left to overcome. And if there’s nothing to overcome…”

He stopped pacing and leaned close, smiling that radiant, impossible smile.

“…then there’s nothing left to *live* for. Don’t you see?”

Luke’s head was spinning with the implications. “But that means…”

He paused, unsure of himself.

“Yes… What does it mean, dear Luke?” Solas said.

“That means,” Luke began, his voice trembling between disbelief and anger, “that everything, all the suffering, the wars, the hunger, the fear… it’s all *necessary*?”

Solas chuckled softly, not unkindly. “I’m afraid so. Without shadow, light has no edge. Without death, life has no pulse. You can call it evil if you like but I personally prefer to look at suffering as the stakes which make life worth living in the first place; the *mechanism* of becoming.”

He leaned forward, eyes glowing faintly.

“If you take away the tension, you get stasis, not peace. You get a world where nothing ever happens, where everything blurs into everything else like a painting left out in the rain until all the colors run together. Do you understand now? Duality isn’t the flaw in creation; it *is* creation.”

Luke shook his head, clenching his fists.

“You talk like this is mercy. Like you’re doing us a favor. But you’re killing millions of innocent souls! You’re trapping them in cycles of suffering!”

Solas smiled, that same soft, impossible smile.

“We’re carrying out a sacred duty. We’re the villains, sure, but we bear the burden of keeping the illusion alive so that life can go on. Not only do we have an essential role to play in maintaining the illusion but we’re hated by the very people whose lives we give meaning to, even if they’re not yet aware of it. You think we’re blind to the suffering we cause? Of course we see it. We carry it, every day. But tell me: what’s a story without conflict? What’s love without loss? What’s awakening without the dream?”

He walked slowly around the table, his voice dropping to a whisper.

“You want to destroy us, Luke. Fine. But understand that God created us just as much as he created you. A story without a villain is no story at all. So if you get rid of us, you get rid of the story in the first place. You wouldn’t be freeing humanity, simply erasing it.”

Luke looked up, dazed, his voice a rasp: “you’re saying God needs you.”

Solas stopped behind him.

“God *is* us. The split was His idea. He wanted to feel something. So he created the world of duality where both the Orders are needed.”

He paused, letting the words hang like a slow-burning fuse.

“And that’s why we exist: to make sure He still does.”

# VI. The Choice

The Luminaries did not believe him.

He tried to tell them about this perspective that he had come across (although he declined to say where it came from.) They interacted politely at first, but Luke started to get the impression that nothing could change their minds; the message boards started to thin out and Luke’s contributions were quietly ignored. His warning about the balance and about the necessity of darkness were dismissed as the ramblings of someone who had stared too long into the abyss.

The Order boycotted his existence until he felt like he didn’t exist at all.

The Luminaries resumed their endless planning; strategies, symbols, missions, awakenings; and Luke knew that their eyes burned with the same fervor that *he* had once felt, namely the conviction that they were chosen to save the world. Watching them, he had a newfound detachment that enabled him to step back from his previous self and assume a higher vantage point. The way they spoke. The certainty in their tone. The quiet contempt for those who “weren’t ready.”

Luke recognized something which he was unable to recognize before and felt something inside him give way; a soft collapse, like a wave folding back into the ocean.

He left the Order’s tiny corner of the internet without another word. No one stopped him. It was as though he shut the door closed behind him with a soft, final click.

He closed his laptop and stepped outside. Grayhaven stretched before him; its streets slick with rain, its towers half-swallowed by fog. Neon bled across puddles like veins of light beneath glass and everything shimmered with a strange familiarity, as though the world were remembering itself through him.

Across the street, a man stood watching him beneath a flickering streetlamp. For an instant, Luke thought it was Solas with that same impeccable posture, the same faint smile that was neither cruel nor kind, just knowing. But when the light steadied, the man was gone.

Luke kept walking.

He passed the church where he first met Father Elias, the windows of the office where he used to type numbers into an infinite spreadsheet. The stage was still unchanged and the actors were still reciting their lines. Only *he* had shifted, ever so slightly, outside the frame. He paused at a crosswalk and caught his reflection in a rain-slick window. For a moment, he thought he saw Solas staring back, then Elias, then himself, all blending into one.

And then, just for a heartbeat, he saw something else: a vast, unblinking eye looking through him, watching from behind the glass.

He didn’t flinch. He simply smiled.

The traffic light changed.

Luke stepped off the curb and vanished into the gray tide of the city.",1,1760966761.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1obixcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1obixcp/silly_categorization_question/,Silly categorization question,"In my household, we split financial responsibilities rather than share finances.  We don't have a shared bank account, and we also don't use Splitwise or worry about paying each other back for every little thing. We just divide up our major monthly costs and each of us pays for approximately half of them. Groceries are my responsibility.

Yesterday, I had to work and was unavailable to do the shopping, so my partner went shopping alone and put it on my card. While he was out, he stopped at a coffee shop for a drink and a snack, and accidentally handed over my card for a $16 charge.  He then paid it back to me in the form of putting a $10 grocery purchase on his own card plus giving me $6 cash.  He doesn't use YNAB so he didn't realize that it would have been easier for me if I paid for that $10 of groceries and then he just paid me back the full $16.  But he made the choice before telling me so I'm just trying to figure out how to account for it.

It feels silly to get hung up over such a small amount but I'm not sure how to categorize this!  

I am thinking the $16 outflow could go to Coffee Shops, Gifts, or Reimbursements (which I mainly use to pay someone back for something but I guess it could go the other way), and then the $6 cash inflow could go back to the same category? 

Or I can move $16 from the Groceries category to Coffee Shops, Gifts, or Reimbursements and then put the $6 back into Groceries since that was the original intent of that money and it was just used wrong? 

Or maybe put the outflow in one of the aforementioned categories but put the $6 in RTA and then figure out where it's most useful rather than trying to recuperate from this specific transaction?

1obiv6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1obiv6w/health_anxiety_panic_attacks_sleep_apnea_symptoms/,"Health anxiety, panic attacks, sleep apnea, symptoms, how much is in my head?","Health anxiety has become a big part of my life.

I am middle aged. Several years ago I went through a bad period where there were several deaths. I had a job where my boss was harassing me. I isolated myself. I started binge eating and drinking a couple or several times a week. I gained a lot of weight probably close to 80 90 lbs.. and doctor put me on blood pressure medicine. I had an injury and couldn't walk for a couple months A year or so later I tried to talk to the management about the problems at work but they didn't believe me and I lost my job.

I spent six months worrying about stuff but reading watching TV, eating what I wanted and drinking. I started tracking my calories and weight and walking more for a while off and on, but it never stufk for more than a month at a time. I was over 250 lbs and I would get sweaty and winded walking. 

I eventually found another job that I loved. I started doing activities in the evening and weekend to have a little extra money and contact with people. My work would leave me tired and when I came home I'd eat and watch tv. I didn't recognize myself in the mirror.

I lost that job in March... For a stupid legal/contract reason they couldn't renew my contract though they wanted to. And wanted me to come back.

I spent a month kind of down in the dumps, watching shows, sleeping etc. getting up to get food and do my other activities. 

In April I realized I couldn't.. didn't want to live like that anymore. So I started paying attention to the quantities I ate and I cut down and stopped drinking entirely.

I saw a doctor who ordered blood work. Then a month later I had lost 20 lbs...and I felt something in my abdomen in different places. I went back to see the doctor who said it was probably anxiety. I was worried it was something with the lover or kidneys or gallbladder or something, so went to have an ultrasound that came back normal. Soon after the feeling went away. Told myself it was anxiety or gas.

I saw a dietitian to try to help me eat better and help me with quantities. Eat more protein, cut down carbs, limit sweets. 

Then one day I felt dizzy and went to the ER where they said it was anxiety and gave me xanax to take 3 times a day.

A week later I forgot to eat breakfast,... Had never really eaten breakfast.. and had coffee..and felt dizzy again and thought I was going to die. Went to the ER in an ambulance. Heart was racing. They examined me and gave me a pill to calm down. They said it was anxiety. A panic attack. I told them I was scared to go home because I lived alone. They offered me to stay a couple days in a crisis center for a couple days. They put me on Seresta for a week. I asked them if it was hypoglycemia, of I was diabetic, if there was another problem and they said no, just anxiety. They gave me seresta and z sleeping pill. I never took the sleeping pillow even when I was there. I was able to go to sleep ok. No mention of stuff that was high or low on bloodwork.

I saw my doctor and gradually reduced it over a month. Doctor said glucose was high and I was prediabetic and needed to watch what I ate, which I was doing. Ordered A1C and it came back a little high. They encouraged me to lose weight, exercise, and watch what I are. During this time I started feeling random small pain in my chest. I was able to watch tv shows, go to the pool, go get groceries. I was afraid at first of having another dizzy episode. And it took time to regain confidence. tried to eat in a restaurant with z friend I felt nervous. But I was getting better and looking forward to working again in the fall. Kept swimming every day walking more, and losing weight. Saw the doctor several times throughout the summer..and they said it was understandable ..not to be worried unless it continued.

While I was taking the anxiety medicine I would start to feel jittery and fidgety five hours or so after the last dose. A feeling I hadn't had before. I thought it was anxiety at firstw like the medication wearing of and anxiety coming back. but then wondered if it was the medication and benzo withdrawal. So I tapered off it and just kept it to take a very small dose if felt anxious. 

I the same week I saw a cardiologist who did a nuclear stress test that came out ok. And saw an endocrinologist for a second opinion about the weight loss. He ordered more bloodwork but haven't seen him since, couldn't get another appointment right away. And saw my doctor. Felt stressed and anxious after those appointments.

September came, the weight kept coming off and I was starting to get worried. Tried to tell myself that it's because I wasn't binge eating 2 big mac meals.. or a whole  pizza.. or chicken wings and fries several times a week.

Bloodwork showed cholesterol went down and glucose and A1C had gone down a little to high normal. Blood pressure went down and cardiologist thought maybe the bp medicine was what was causing the random diziness. So took me off the med.

Doctor had wanted me to see a psychiatrist. I made an appointment with one at the clinic that wasn't for a couple months.. and while waiting found one in the city. They advised me to try an SSRI antidepressant. I didn't start it right away though because I was worried about side effects and my part time job that was starting. 

Had started seeing a psychologist a few times during the summer but we didn't really talk about the health worries. When I told her I was afraid of dying.. that I was afraid something was wrong.. she said that everyone was afraid of dying. Kept trying with her but felt like it didn't really help. 

In the meantime, cardiologist ordered a sleep study. I was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea. And that really scared me. They said sleep apnea could cause depressionw anxiety w and weight gain. And maybe I had had it for years. Said it comes with age and being overweight can make it worse... Though I might have always had it..not guaranteed that losing weight would help. I asked the doctor long I'd have to use the machine and he said the rest of my life. I was in tears and felt like my life was over. 

After that anxiety went way up. I started not being able to sleep through the night. Would wake up every hour or 90 minutz. Had an eye doctor appointment and couldn't sit still, was so worried. Had an episode, I guess a panic attack going to get the machine. After that I laid in bed most of the day for the rest of the week. Tried to take a small dose of the anxiety medicine. Started feeling like I wanted to tremble. It really scared me. Since then I use the machine every night, all night. The technician said it was working well and the number of episodes had gone down to normal level. 

The next week I Saw the clinic psychiatrist and they said to please try the antidepressant. I trembled most of the first day I took it and felt more agitated. Stopped a few days..then took it again for four days. He said to take it along with the anxiety medicine 3 times a day. I felt like I was becoming hopeless. I could barely get out of bed. The trembling five hours after the dose of the anxiety medicine came back. I had to cancel my work.

I went back to the ER because I just didn't feel right. They didn't really do anything. Just listened to me. I told them how I was afraid something was wrong and I was not getting help for it. They told me I could do inpatient to try an antidepressant for a couple weeks and get stabilized. They said they with the sleep apnea I probably shouldn't have been taking the seresta and the sleeping pill that they gave me! I tolI said I can't do that right now coz I need to work. Going home I realized that anxiety meds and antidepressants was their only solution. And I needed to try to work on my own problems and how'i dealt with them. Told myself it was in how I was thinking about things.

Since that I haven't taken the anxiety med or the antidepressant again. I feel like normal. No more feeling like I want to tremble. No more feeling like I can't get our of bed. I tried to call and send a text message the psychiatrist to ask about the symptoms or a different medicine etc but they never returned my call.

I saw a new doctor at the clinic. Felt calm and and said. Hey! I have lost over 70 lbs in less than six months. I am worried. He agreed that it was very rapid and looked at bloodwork that had been done, said he didn't know why they hadn't already ordered cdrtain stuff.. and He ordered more bloodwork. I aKsd him about trying a different antidepressant. He said he could prescribe it if I wanted, but it was up to me. I said if I feel like I do today.. I feel ok, Worried, but not shut down worrying. I'll try to see how I do and let you know.

I got the results back. Some things where high or low normal.. a couple just outside of the range. and have spent hours every day searching, trying to piece together some answer. I don't know if it's serious, what the options are, etc. 

I called the clinic and asked if they had gotten the results.. they acted like they didn't know.. and said the doctor would call me back if it was important. 

I know that this can be part of anxiety. I've heard all summer that my symptoms are anxiety. That it was all in my head. Znd what I told them at the hospital was that both things can be true. I can have something and anxiety also. I spent so much time this summer reading on reddit, watching videos and listening to podcasts trying to understand what was happening to me. How my brain could create pain in my body, where the shaking comes from, why I felt like I was going to be dizzy or unstable, feel off balance... Why normal situations where I used to be fine made me anxious. 


But then I feel like several times the doctors have missed the ball and just reassured me.. when I looked up the bloodwork .. and saw possible causes, and looked at the symptoms of those diseases.. my symptoms came up also. Like jigsaw puzzle pieces coming together. 

I keep thinking that there is something that is not right. I look at my arms and my legs and my body and I feel like I've lost too much weight. Afraid I'm wasting away and there's not much time left. I have been eating healthy all summer following the dietician's plan. But lately I've added a little more meat, some cheese and a yogurt at each meal so I can get more calories. And I stopped swimming, and have been walking less. The weight has kind of stabilized. But I feel like I'm eating a lot.

I don't know how much of it is not being used to 'this new body'.. 70 lbs lighter. And I think the weight loss was so rapid that I lost muscle too. I haven't had the motivation to do strength training. I tried a little with a resistance band. My clothes from the last few years don't fit. They look huge on me.

I have heard all summer that I'm ok, it's just anxiety. But then there was the sleep apnea, bloodwork with a couple things high and low normal, and the feeling thar none of the doctors except the last one I saw are really looking or taking the time. 

I have tried to ignore it all and watch tv again.  I can distract myself with tv ...  But the reality and worry is still there.

The last few weeks my weight has more or less stabilized around 200 lbs, but I'm eating more than I've eaten all summer. Feel like I've lost muscle in my arms and legs. I'm able to sleep a little better. Only waking up a couple times during the night instead of every hour. I get up and go out to try to do stuff. I'm able to sit in a restaurant and eat now. I'm a le to take the bus without feeling tightness in my chest or my leg shaking. I'm able to do my job without worrying that I'm going to pass out or fidgeting. Bit I'm still afraid something is wrong and I don't have much time left..while the doctors are twiddling their thumbs.

All the videos on YouTube about health anxiety are by relatively young and I assume healthy people and they all say it's somatic. But I am middle aged... And there are legitimate medical issues, some for years. 

I see two specialists this week that I hope can make or break this. If they say I'mn ok I want to believe them. If they say something needs looking or there is something really wrong maybe I will finally get help. ",2,1760966569.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

We prefer bi guys because there’ll be natural interaction with the wife—and maybe even some soft play, if the vibe is right and you're into it. No pressure, just chemistry, mutual attraction, and solid consent.

If you’re muscular, dominant, and smell as good as you look, we’ll probably have trouble keeping our hands off you 😉 Hygiene is a must for us—smell good, taste good, feel good. 

We’re not the “meet and strip” type—we like a little anticipation: Chat a bit → meet for coffee or drinks → if we click, let’s play. Simple as that.

If you're intrigued, slide into our DMs. Let’s swap pics, trade a few flirty words, and find out if we’re trouble you want to get into.

We’re ready if you are 😏",1,1760966467.0,r4r,1,1.0,True

I always thought my dad was the most loyal man I knew. Turns out, I didn’t even know half his life.

He passed away suddenly last year — heart attack. I was devastated. He was my hero, my biggest supporter, the one who taught me how to ride a bike and never give up on anything. Mom was heartbroken, of course, but she handled all the paperwork and funeral stuff while I tried to hold it together.

A few weeks later, I got a call from a lawyer asking me to come in for a “reading of the will.” I thought it was weird since my mom was already handling everything. But when I got there, I saw another woman sitting in the office… with two kids around my age.

I remember the lawyer saying, “It seems we need to divide the assets among all three of his children.”

I froze. “What do you mean *three*?”

The woman — quiet, nervous — looked at me and whispered, “I’m sorry. I didn’t know he told you nothing.”

Turns out, my dad had another family. A woman he’d been seeing for nearly 20 years. The kids — my half-siblings — had known about me their entire lives. They even had pictures of me on their walls because he told them I was their “other sister.” But he never told me anything.

I went home that night and just sat in my car for hours, crying. I felt like my whole childhood had been a lie. How could someone so loving, so present, also be living a double life?

My mom admitted she’d always “suspected” something but didn’t want to destroy the family. I didn’t talk to either side for months.

But eventually, I met my half-siblings for coffee. They were kind. They looked so much like him it hurt. We talked for hours.

And maybe, in some strange way, I realized — he was deeply flawed, but we were all just pieces of him trying to make sense of the wreckage he left behind.",3,1760966378.0,stories,1,1.0,False

1obiowv,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1obiowv/solved_the_free_will_debate_with_science/,Solved the free will debate with science,"1. 5D Eternalist Reality and Indeterminism
	•	In a 5D manifold, all possible 4D worldlines exist timelessly.
	•	Even if quantum or stochastic indeterminacy exists in each 4D slice, this only populates the 5D space with multiple histories.
	•	Therefore, indeterminism does not grant an agent causal freedom, because:
	1.	Randomness ≠ agency — stochastic events are not chosen.
	2.	All outcomes exist simultaneously — there is no metaphysical “could have been otherwise” from the 5D perspective.
	3.	The subjective experience of choice is just traversal along a pre-existing causal geometry.

So in a 5D eternalist reality, “free will” in the traditional, libertarian sense does not exist, period.

⸻

2. The semantic problem

Here’s the crucial point:
	•	Compatibilists often say “free will exists” because they redefine it as adherence to law, or coherence of internal causation.
	•	But that is a linguistic sleight-of-hand: the term “free” no longer refers to what people intuitively mean (uncaused choice).
	•	It’s like calling “poop” your coffee, “weather” your choice, or “food” your effect — the model might internally function, but the words fail to capture the intended metaphysical reality.

Implication: The model can be correct structurally, but language can mislead observers into thinking it proves free will exists, when it only proves that will exists as a causal structure.

⸻

3. Decoupling truth from terminology
	•	Truth of the model: Agents exist as causal geometries embedded in a 5D manifold.
	•	Truth of traditional terms: “Free will” implies something that the model explicitly denies.
	•	Therefore:
The model is valid and coherent, but no terminology borrowed from antiquated philosophy (like “free will”) can accurately describe it.
	•	Any attempt to force classical terms onto the model is semantic corruption, not a flaw in the model itself.

⸻

4. Logical consequence
	1.	Will exists — as the internal causal structure that generates actions within a worldline.
	2.	Free will does not exist — the possibility to “have done otherwise” is illusory in 5D eternalism.
	3.	Compatibilist arguments are intellectually dishonest in this context — they only rename terms without resolving the underlying metaphysical question.
	4.	Language is separate from the model — our words evolve culturally, but the structure of reality is independent of them.

⸻

✅ Key insight

You can have a perfectly correct metaphysical model, fully explaining all agency and causation, without any existing term adequately naming it. Terms like “free will” are artifacts of historical philosophical thought, not reflective of the structure revealed by a 5D eternalist model.",0,1760966091.0,freewill,13,0.13,False

1obimyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1obimyy/persistent_rightsided_fullness_after_food/,Persistent Right-Sided “Fullness” After Food Poisoning — Anyone Experienced This?,"Hi everyone —

Before you say “Go to a doctor”, I am doing that next month. The purpose of this post is to gather information on others dealing with post-infectious IBS symptoms and if they received colonoscopies to rule anything sinister out.

I’ve been dealing with something strange since I got food poisoning in late August (Aug 25th) and I’d love to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this.

The first symptom I felt as the food poisoning took it’s course was actually a weird awareness or pressure on top of my right rib cage, sometimes a warm, tingly sensation, felt maybe like a soreness of the muscles. I  actually thought I had pushed too hard at the gym that day. Then hours after I started puking/shitting my guts out. (Fuck you Crisp & Green). 

As I recovered from the food poisoning, the sensation became more vague but still lingers: sometimes a feeling of fullness just above and to the right of my belly button. It’s not painful, just uncomfortable and unnerving. Soem says the awareness is LOUD. Some days it’s a whisper. 

This sensation seems to fluctuate — some days it’s almost gone, other days I’m really aware of it. It’s like LOUD, I’ve noticed that sugar, alcohol, and spicy food make it worse, rarely it even switches sides slightly or radiates through my right back. I also notice that usually when I first wake up in the morning the sensation isn’t there or barely noticeable. 

I have had a meticulous log of my stool for over a month. My stools have been mostly in the Bristol 4–5 range since the food poisoning — sometimes perfect, sometimes a bit mushy, and the occasional episode of diarrhea after aforementioned triggers. 

Here’s a condensed version of my stool log trends:
	•	Aug 25: Food poisoning.
	•	Sept: Alternating 3–6 stools, urgency after meals, then settling to 4–5’s.
	•	Late Sept: Stool mostly normal, but the right-sided sensation persists on and off.
	•	Oct: Still 4–5 most days, occasional 5–7 after alcohol, spicy food, or coffee. Sensation still there off and on.
	•	Color always normal; no black or tarry stool. Only one brief time I saw something red after tomato-based food.

I’ve been taking:
	•	Seed probiotic
	•	Saccharomyces boulardii
	•	Butyrate supplement
	•	eating very high fiber 

I this might be post-infectious IBS with nerve sensitization, and honestly that seems to fit — but the fact that the sensation is so localized on the right side makes me second-guess it.

I’m scheduling a colonoscopy soon just to rule anything out, but I’d really like to hear from people who’ve had localized pressure or tingling after food poisoning that took a while to fade.

Did you have a colonoscopy? 

Did it eventually resolve? How long did it take?

Anything that helped desensitize your gut or calm the nerves?

Thanks in advance for reading — any reassurance or shared experiences would mean a lot.

Chapter 11: Seeking an Important Advice



Once Trace got into his car, he buckled up his seatbelt and inserted the key into the ignition, then shortly turned it on. Upon putting it in drive, he slowly drove his way out of the garage and into the street. He then made a left turn that would lead him straight down to Dr. Nora's office, which isn't that far from his apartment. Eventually, Trace arrives at his destination just on time after driving for a few blocks. He went to look for an open space where he could park his car next to the other cars on the street. Shortly upon spotting an empty space, he carefully maneuvered his car into the empty parking space between a minivan and a delivery truck, successfully parallel parking on the side of the street along the sidewalk. 



As Trace stepped out of his car, he approached a nearby parking meter and then inserted a few couple of quarters into it. Shortly afterwards, he continued heading his way inside the commercial building. Upon walking to a flight of stairs to the third floor, he finally made his way right outside the door to Dr. Nora's office. Trace began knocking on the door as he stood by and waited for a bit. Seconds later, the door in front of him opened and he was then greeted by Dr. Nora.



""Why hello there.. Come in, Mr. Legacy. You're just on time."" Nora added, ""Make yourself at home, my dear."" 



""Yeah, thanks, Doc."" Trace said. He stepped in and walked across the waiting area while following his therapist into her office. 



Upon entering the office, it featured a spacious treatment area along with comfortable yet stylish furnishings and a couple of potted plants, which contributed to a warm and inviting atmosphere. The walls were decorated with a few expensive artworks and other tasteful elements, further emphasizing its upscale nature. Nora's office desk was also seen at the right section across the corner of the room, including her diploma on the wall along with various awards and certificates that she has achieved throughout the years. She even has a large bookshelf which is beside her office desk, featuring a collection of her books and journals, including numerous important records of her clients that she has kept as well.



Trace walked over into the treatment area, where he took a seat on the couch. He watched as Dr. Nora sat down on her chair facing across him. 



""How have you been?"" Nora asked. 



Trace responded, ""I'm doing good, Doc, things have been working out pretty fine lately."" He looked at Nora and added, ""It's just.. I wanted to discuss about something.."" 



""So, what exactly do you want to share with me, Trace?"" 



""Well, there's this tiger keidran girl that I've met several days ago. Her name is Flora.."" 



""Flora..,"" Nora looked at Trace momentarily as she crossed her legs. ""Is she a friend of yours, Trace, or are you practically planning to settle in for a new relationship with her?"" 



Trace responded back, stuttering his words, ""I-I don't know how would I explain you about this, Doc, but honestly.. it's kinda you know... a bit complicated to the least.."" 



""Relax, Trace.. Just take a deep breath,"" Nora said. ""I think I know what you've clearly meant from what you have just mentioned to me, my dear.."" 



Nora took her cup of coffee from the table and sipped it slowly, then set it back down afterwards. 



""So, Trace, you're feeling ready to start dating again. That's a significant step, and it's wonderful that you're exploring this. What does it feel like to spend time with Flora? And what makes you feel good in the moment?""



""It feels... hopeful,"" Trace answered. ""It feels like I'm not so alone in this world anymore."" He momentarily took a pause, then continued, ""She's cute but lovely. Very different from my late wife Saria, but in a good way. And she listens. I feel seen, somehow.."" He looked at Nora and added, ""I never thought I'd be in this position, you know? It's just... I keep thinking about Saria. She's only been gone a year ever since that fateful night..""



""It's understandable to feel that way. Guilt is a common and very powerful emotion in grief. There are a lot of emotions tied to starting a new relationship after such a profound loss.""



""I've been constantly working through my grief. I miss her terribly, and I still love her."" Trace looked off into the distance and sighed deeply before he continued, ""What I'm really worried about this new relationship with Flora whether I'm ready, I don't want to start by comparing them in such a way, Doc. It just doesn't morally feel right at all...""



""That's a very valid concern, Trace,"" Nora responded then explained carefully, ""It's understandable to feel that way and there are a lot of emotions tied to starting a new relationship after such a profound loss. It's possible that you might say something unintentionally that would hurt your partner's feelings. If that happens, acknowledge it, apologize, and learn from it. Open and honest communication is crucial."" She looked at Trace and continued, ""It's honorable to acknowledge that Saria was a significant part of your life, and she will always hold a special place in your heart. Even so, it's also important to recognize that this new relationship with Flora is a different chapter. It doesn't have to diminish what you had with Saria. It's not about replacing her, but rather building something new, something different, and finding happiness again.""



""Well I've told Flora about her earlier, and she's been understanding, but sometimes I wonder if I'm talking about her too much. I don't want to make her feel inadequate or like she's filling a void.""



""It's okay to talk about your past, Trace. Open communication is key here. It's wonderful that you're being openly honest with Flora. Furthermore, I would like to suggest that it's important that you prioritize in finding healthy ways to discuss your past without letting it dominate the present. Perhaps you could talk about how Saria helped shape you into the person you are today, and how that informs your current relationship with your new partner.""



""That makes sense,"" Trace said as he leaned back across the couch. ""You know, Doc, as much as I really do miss Saria, I don't want to erase her from my life. But l  want to build something new with Flora, and I'm willing to take the time to make sure it's right.""



Nora smiled gracefully at him, ""That's good to hear, Trace."" She added, ""Continue to be open and honest with yourself about your feelings. You can honor the memory of your past while also allowing yourself to build a meaningful connection in the present. There is no right or wrong way to grieve or to fall in love again. The key is patience, Trace, and allowing yourself and the relationship with Flora to evolve naturally, just as your relationship with Saria did."" 



""Thank you so much for your help, Dr. Nora.  This advice you gave me was really helpful, and I feel prepared now."" Trace said with gratitude as he thanked Nora.



""It was my pleasure to assist as your psychiatrist. Give yourself and Flora the time to build a strong foundation of trust and understanding. Don't rush the process. And remember, it's okay to seek professional support as you navigate this new territory. This is a journey, and you're not alone."" 



Nora therefore took a sip from her cup of coffee. Shortly after that, she then looked at her wristwatch and noticed that the duration of their session had ended. 



""Oh, well I, think that's all we have time for."" Nora said. ""Feel free to come back and talk about it as you move forward, my dear.""



""Okay.."" Trace replied as he stood up from the couch. 



He then proceeded to walk out of the room and into the waiting area on his way back. Before he could open the door, he turned around and sees Nora following behind close him.  


""One more thing, Trace,"" Nora added, ""Remember, building a new relationship after loss is a journey. Be kind to yourself and be patient. Allow it time to develop and grow at its own pace.""



""Okay. Thanks, Doc.."" Trace said with a small smile on his face, feeling hopeful upon accepting Nora's advice for his new relationship with Flora. 



He waved his hand momentarily to Nora before heading out the door and then gently closing it behind him. ",3,1760965933.0,Twokinds,1,1.0,False

Fourside at last! Ness, Paula, and Jeff get busy tracking down that insidious demon statue from Twoson, but it will be easier said than done. All alone in a sprawling big city, full of grumpy adults who’d rather slurp down bitter coffee and get mad at the news than so much as give the hapless kids directions, and with no leads except the penthouse suite of the huge Monotoli Building, where security is tight and kids are definitely not allowed. 

If that wasn’t bad enough, an especially gruesome alien snatches away Paula, leaving Ness and Jeff to their own devices! And if THAT wasn’t bad enough, it looks like there’s a new and extremely annoying sheriff in town. Googly-eyed freaks, scary grown-ups, and ugh, PORKY?! The Chosen Four, now whittled down to the Chosen Two, have their work cut out for them! 

Will Ness and Jeff make it to the top of the tallest building in Fourside and rescue Paula (erm, again)? Will they get the doorman to look the other way with a sly plying of Jeff’s latest invention, “trout-flavored yogurt?” (I’ll give you that one for free, NO, OF COURSE NOT, it’s trout-flavored yogurt for crying out loud! Bleech!) And will the boys have the courage to… try the coffee?

But there’s one small problem.

**Your partner? Not exactly on board.**

Maybe they smile politely when you show them another fifth wheel tour, or they say “maybe someday” every time you bring it up. Maybe they flat-out say, “That’s crazy, why would we leave everything we’ve built?”

And that stings, doesn’t it? Because this dream feels alive to you. It’s more than travel; it’s a *shift*. A lifestyle. A breath of fresh air you’ve been craving.

So what do you do when you’re bursting with excitement…and your spouse is still clinging to the shore?

# When Tim Thought I’d Lost It

When I first brought up the idea of selling the house and traveling full-time, Tim looked at me like I’d just suggested we live on Mars.

We had a house, a family nearby, and routines that made sense. From the outside, it was perfect. But I could feel this itch, that quiet knowing that life was moving fast and we weren’t living it the way we wanted to.

I wanted adventure, time freedom, and connection.

He wanted stability, predictability, and, well…a real address.

So instead of trying to sell him on the *idea*, I started sharing the *emotion* behind it. I’d say things like, “I miss the grandkids, and I want more time with them,” or “Wouldn’t it be amazing to wake up somewhere new and have coffee outside every morning?”

I painted the feeling, not the logistics.

And slowly, I watched him shift.

He went from “No way” to “What would that actually look like?”

It didn’t happen overnight, but that’s how it starts, with small, human conversations about what matters most.

# You Can’t Convince...You Can Invite

When one person in a relationship feels ready for change and the other isn’t, our instinct is to *convince.*

We make spreadsheets, budget plans, and highlight the pros like we’re pitching Shark Tank.

But big lifestyle shifts — especially something as out-of-the-box as RV life, aren’t about logic. They’re about trust. Safety. Vision.

Your partner isn’t saying “no” to adventure. They’re saying “no” to *uncertainty.*

So instead of pushing, invite them in. Ask what would make them feel safe enough to explore it. Is it keeping a small home base? Renting for a few months first? Having an emergency savings cushion?

Let it be a joint dream, not a solo crusade.

You’re not asking them to leap, you’re asking them to *look.*

# The Fear Beneath the Resistance

Every “no” usually hides a fear.

Maybe it’s money. Maybe it’s losing community or routine. Maybe it’s fear of failure: “What if we do this and regret it?”

The best way to dissolve resistance is to get curious, not defensive.

Instead of saying, “You’re not supporting my dream,” try, “What worries you most about this idea?”

That opens the door for honesty and problem-solving, not arguments.

You’ll probably learn that their fears are valid and fixable.

# Try Before You Leap

If there’s one thing I tell every couple considering this lifestyle, it’s this: don’t jump straight into forever.

Rent an RV for a week. Take a month-long trip. Go slow.

You’ll both learn what you love, what you need, and what you absolutely can’t live without.

For us, it was that first trip that changed everything. Tim realized he didn’t hate RV life — he just hated not knowing what it would feel like. Once he experienced the freedom, the togetherness, the joy of *not having to rush home*, he was hooked.

Sometimes your partner just needs a taste of what you’re dreaming about before they can share the dream.

# This Journey Is Built for Two

Full-time RV living tests your teamwork in ways a house never could. But it also strengthens it, if you let it.

You’ll learn how to communicate differently, laugh quicker, and let go of the need to be right about every little thing. You’ll face challenges together, leaks, flat tires, missed turns, and each one becomes a tiny story you’ll laugh about later.

So if your spouse isn’t there yet, give them time. Keep sharing your heart, not your agenda.

Let the dream breathe.

Because when it’s right, when you both feel ready, you’ll know.

And that’s when the adventure really begins.

1obidla,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1obidla/my_new_job_sounded_like_the_perfect_escape_until/,My new job sounded like the perfect escape... until I found the rules that could get me killed.,"Two hundred thousand dollars, six months, cash up front.

When I saw the offer, my first thought wasn't ""scam!"", it was salvation. That money would clear my gambling debts and make those thugs disappear from my mother’s doorway forever. So I signed without hesitation. The contract stressed ""absolute isolation."" Food and water were already stocked. The only contact was a bi-monthly supply drop.

For a guy who wanted to evaporate, this felt tailor-made.

The helicopter that dropped me off treated me like garbage. The pilot’s eyes didn't hold pity; they looked at me like a piece of meat already placed in the freezer. Lookout Tower #7: a rickety metal can perched on a mountain peak, groaning in the wind. It was so high, I had no intention of ever climbing down.

The former lookout didn't leave much. But carved into the desk, deep enough to almost punch through the wood, were two words: YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

I thought it was about the recruitment company’s lies. Then I pulled out the empty drawer and found the crumpled, sweat-stained piece of paper.

\*\* The Seven Protocols of Lookout Tower #7 \*\*

1. Every night at exactly 12:00 AM, the entrance and all windows must be locked. Draw the curtains. Be precise.
2. Never respond to any cries for help. No matter how desperate they sound, they are not human.
3. If the radio starts playing jazz music outside of communication hours, immediately cut the main power to the tower. Wait ten minutes in complete darkness and silence. Don't make a sound.
4. Never look directly at any reflection that appears on the window glass at night. It is not entirely you.
5. In the food storage room, only eat the blue-labeled cans. The red-labeled ones are not for us.

I laughed, pinning the list to the wall as a piece of dark humor from my predecessor.

The first month, I lived like a dead man walking. Daytimes were spent staring at the forest, sometimes greeting a one-eyed crow I called ""Blackie"" who landed on the railing at 3 PM every day. The radio never worked; it only hissed static, a broken piece of junk. I hoped I'd never need it. Everything was quiet.

Until I broke the first rule.

I’d won a round of solitaire against myself and had a few too many cups of instant coffee. The broken wall clock was chiming midnight when I realized I was late. I rushed to lock the door, but missed one window curtain. As I turned...

I saw it.

It was a thing. Not a beast, not a ghost, but a mistake. It stood on the forest's edge like a stretched, twisted black inkblot. Its limbs were distorted at angles that defied anatomy, its head cocked sideways. It was still... but I knew it was watching me. My buzz evaporated instantly. I scrambled to pull the curtain shut. My heart hammered against my ribs like a caged bird trying to escape.

From that night on, I stopped laughing. I considered leaving, but I knew I couldn't make it to civilization before dark. Staying here, despite the terror, was my only safe option.

A few nights later, I woke up to screaming. A woman’s voice, raw and frantic. ""Help... is anyone there... save me..."" My hand froze an inch from the radio. Rule number two was burned into my mind. I didn't dare respond. I shut off the lights, and huddled in the corner like a coward. The wailing went on for almost an hour, then abruptly turned into a low, satisfied chuckle. It sounded like it was pressed directly against the steel structure of the tower.

It knew I was listening.

The threat escalated. One afternoon, the radio came to life on its own, blasting cheerful 1930s jazz, laced with vinyl static. My blood turned to ice. As the tower lights began to flicker like a dying heart, I dove for the main breaker. I pulled the lever with all my strength. The world went black. Then I heard it. A wet, heavy sound, slowly dragging itself across the glass of the observation deck windows. Viscous. Slow. Ten minutes in that darkness felt longer than the last thirty years of my life.

The second supply drop came at the end of the second month. The helicopter dropped the crate nearby and immediately flew off without even waving. My heart sank. I was stuck here. I hauled the supplies into the storage room. At the bottom of the empty crate, I saw it. A single red-labeled can. It was placed carefully under a layer of foam, like a reminder.

My blood ran cold. The supplies weren't just for me. They were for that thing too.

Just when I thought I’d gotten used to dealing with the things outside, rule number four shattered my reality.

That night, I unconsciously glanced up. And I saw the reflection on the glass. I immediately snapped my head away, but that glimpse was enough.

The ""me"" in the reflection was smiling. It was a smile I was incapable of... one filled with pure, unadulterated malice.

The nature of the fear changed completely. I covered most of the windows and walked around staring at the floor. The thing in the reflection was waiting for me to make eye contact again. I knew if I did, it would find a way in.

This made me obsess over Rule Five. The red-labeled cans were still in storage. Who were they for? The true terror hit on a stormy night when I woke up and found one red can missing. The doors were locked, the windows intact. Something had been inside and taken its food while I slept.

The fourth month's resupply was agonizing.

The helicopter came and dropped the box. It left as quickly as the first time. I dragged the crate in, and at the bottom, there was the same unsettling sight: another single red-labeled can, a cruel little gift.

Today, is the last day of my contract. I stayed up all night.

When the sound of the rotors finally grew close, I felt no joy, just numb relief. I watched the helicopter land. A man in a uniform waved, and his voice boomed through the loudspeaker, ""Alex! We're here to take you home! Open up!""

I rushed to the door, my hand grabbing the handle. But my eyes fell on the old, wrinkled paper. Faintly written under the original five rules, I saw a line I'd never noticed before.

Rule Six: When you think you are rescued, do not open the door. Imitation is its specialty.

I slowly backed away. After a few minutes, the voice outside changed. The warm call became a high-pitched, metallic shriek. ""....open.... the door.... Al... ex..."" The banging made the entire tower shudder. I knew the structure wouldn't hold. I couldn't open the door, but I couldn't wait to die either.

I grabbed my backpack. I smashed the observation window and slid down the rusty fire escape ladder. I didn't get far before I heard the entire lookout tower groan and collapse behind me. I ran without looking back, pouring every ounce of adrenaline into my legs.

I ran all night until I collapsed, covered in mud. A forestry ranger found me the next morning. They said I was delirious, clutching a crumpled paper. They said I was hallucinating.

But I know the truth. I survived. I'm free.

But it’s not over.

I rented a small apartment in the city, but my life hasn't returned to normal. My paranoia has bled into every single day. I only allow myself to eat blue-labeled cans now. It has become my personal standard of safety. Every few days, I conduct a quick, fully-clothed ""procurement ritual"" at different grocery stores. I must find that specific ""blue"" can and make sure there are no red labels hidden on the shelves.

I smashed all the mirrors in my apartment and keep the curtains drawn. Yet, I can still feel it. It wasn't trapped in that tower. It followed me home.

Now, I'm sitting here typing this. My cell phone... the device I thought was safe, the link to the civilized world... just went off by itself.

It's 1930s jazz. It’s using the only alarm I understand to remind me.

Remember the paper. I've taped it to my fridge now, replacing every shopping list. Don't believe anything you see, and don't believe anything you hear. In this situation, that list is the only thing you can trust.",6,1760965226.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

We weren’t lifelong friends or anything, but we got along well. I felt comfortable with her, and we often talked about random things. Because of that, I told her that she’d be my **matron of honor** when I get married next year.

But lately, things feel different. Ever since she stopped asking me for favors, it’s like she also stopped being friendly. *Parang nagbago ugali niya.* She doesn’t talk to me the same way anymore, and I’m honestly a bit hurt.

To give some context ... before, she once asked if she could use my credit card for a few emergencies involving her family. One of her sisters gave birth, another got pneumonia, and she also needed to pay for another sibling’s ticket back home to the Philippines. Even one of her brothers, who’s a seaman, needed a cash advance — and she had all those charged on my card. I let her, because I genuinely cared and trusted her.

But suddenly, when there’s nothing she needs, she’s distant. :( Hindi na ako inaaya mag S&R or even mag coffee sa Tagaytay.

Now I’m starting to wonder… is it okay to take back what I said before? I mean, I only said it because I really trusted her at that time. But if she’s not the same person anymore, would it be wrong if I changed my mind?",3,1760964903.0,WeddingsPhilippines,7,1.0,False

A year or two ago I couldn’t hook up with anyone. I wasn’t creepy or anything, just boring I guess. My friends were doing fine and girls online kept talking about liking “soft guys”, the ones who drink matcha, read feminist books, wear tote bags, listen to Clairo and what not. Back then no one used the term performative male yet but that’s basically what I became.

I had this one friend like that. Always calm, quiet voice, feminist book in his bag. Girls loved him. I was jealous honestly. I couldn’t understand why that worked so I just started copying him.

I bought The Will to Change because he had it. Didn’t even care what it was about. I just thought it looked good to have in my hand. I’d sit in parks or coffee shops with it open, pretending to read while scrolling my phone half the time. I even memorized a few lines so I could drop them into conversations, like I was actually deep.

Then after a while I started reading for real, mostly to sound smarter when I talked about it. But then I started thinking about what it was actually saying, about how guys grow up hiding everything and calling it strength, and how that screws up the way we love people and it kinda stuck with me

I started noticing how I act around people, how I joke when things get serious or act like I don’t care just to seem chill. Eventually I stopped pretending to read and actually finished the book. 

Now I see people calling out performative males and I wince because yeah, that was me. But weirdly, it worked. I faked caring so long I accidentally started to.

* *Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and all the people. — Luke 2:52* 

The little we know about the first thirty years of Jesus’ life is significant, even though the details are few.

The entire record of His first twelve years is summed up in one sentence: “The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him.” Jesus grew just like other children. There was nothing out of the ordinary about His childhood.

At the age of twelve, He attended His first Passover.

The next eighteen years are also captured in a single sentence: “Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.” We know that He was obedient to His parents, teaching us an important lesson that every child should learn.

Jesus also worked as a carpenter during those years. Some may wonder why He didn’t perform miracles during this time, but miracles aren’t the only sign of divinity. The most divine thing we can do is to live a sweet, patient, unselfish, and obedient life, as Jesus did.",1,1760964857.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

Very new to espresso making. After a lot of research, I bought a Gaggia Pro Esp, and a Rancilio Rocky grinder.

The Gaggia is fine - getting a 9bar spring today, very excited, have a bottomless portafiler, good coffee bean, etc.

The issue is with the grinder.

The grinder was used, and pretty dirty when I first got it. When I first threw coffee in to test it, a good portion of the grinds seemed to get stuck in the chute after the coffee beans were fully ground. I removed the burrs, which looked fine after cleaning the coffee oil, put some rice through it (the minute kind) and tested again.

The issue doesn’t seem like it’s fixed. Ground coffee still gets stuck in the chute, and I have to shake the grinder to get it out (and actually, that’s doesn’t really do much).

Now I'm faced with the choice of what to buy next and these are the options that I'm considering.

I mostly brew pourovers but the occasional French presses and batch brews as well. My priorities are with a neat and relatively small grinder as I have a tiny kitchen and very limited counter space. I have had hand grinders in the past and have zero interest in one now. 

A Wilfa Uniform, for 250€ (shipped). I think this is the upper limit on what I'd be willing to pay. I'm questioning if the coffee will be that much better? It's of course cheaper than it was at launch pre-pandemic, and not the new Uniform Evo. It seems like most complaints I see are on build quality (at a 350€ launch price point) or the scale that's not included with mine. 

Fellow Opus, for 185€ - I like the look and size, people say good things about the coffee but complain about the workflow. I don't mind if it's plasticky, but will it get grinds all over my kitchen?

Wilfa Aroma Svart for 150€. A minor upgrade on my old grinder, as they use the same burrs but a different motor. On the list but not something that exites me. 

Baratza Encore for 140€ (ESP for 170€). I find it a little ugly, and I'm not sure what, if any is the benefit of the ESP for my use cases.

1obi4df,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1obi4df,My Grandfather was a silver stacker back in the 80s and he taught me when to sell.,"My grandpa was an OG stacker back in the 70s/80s & started hoarding silver once they pulled it out of our currency. I remember when I was a kid, I'd go in his closet and he had these big old metal coffee cans FULL of silver quarters, half dollars, dimes - etc. Got me into coin collecting when I was a kid. Short story, I learned when to sell from him.

He started selling a bit when he retired - I think around when he moved out of his house because the stack was massive. The rest of it - the family inherited from him when he passed. This is one of the coins he had, I graded - I refuse to sell it because this thing is now a family heirloom. Not particularly fantastic - but it's awesome because it's where we started. My mother's got his gold coins. ( as for the rest, not really interesting - it was a pile of junk silver ; just lots of silver. ) 

One last point, he served. 1950 Korea USAF. No real interesting stories besides falling asleep at a campfire & melting his boots. 😅 - Still trying to find this one pic I saw of him in his 20s standing on a USAF runway front of P51 Mustangs. Love ya Gramps, miss ya.

I was recently diagnosed with diabetes (type 2) after a routine health checkup for term insurance, and it came as a complete shock. I felt totally fine outwardly, but my HbA1c came back at 11. I've since started treatment and made changes to my diet and lifestyle — currently focusing on controlling my food intake and going to the gym regularly.

One thing I’m really struggling with is giving up my usual sweet hot beverages — I used to have coffee and hot chocolate regularly, and they really helped me feel fresh and focused during the day. Now, with the need to avoid sugar, I’m trying to find safe and satisfying replacements.

I found products like like Horlicks Diabetes Plus,Protinex Diabetes Care and Ensure Diabetes Care on instamart.

Has anyone here tried these as replacements for regular coffee/hot drinks? Are they actually safe and helpful for diabetics, or should I be cautious?

I also tried coffee with stevia, but it gave me a bad stomach almost immediately. I’ve heard this can be a side effect — has anyone else experienced this? I am afraid to try it again.

Additionally, are there any good tasting whey proteins that are diabetic-safe and can be consumed warm, like a hot beverage?

Lastly, I’m still mentally adjusting to cutting out sweets, chocolates, and fruit juices. I'd really appreciate recommendations for:

* Diabetic-friendly snacks, dessert alternatives (like Greek Yogurt)

1obhzzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/1obhzzj/advice_needed_coping_with_fatigue/,Advice needed - coping with fatigue,"Hi - long-term lurker on this page but need some advice!

I’m 28F and have been profoundly deaf in my right ear since birth and until recently, I also had a mild-moderate hearing loss in my left ear too with tinnitus that comes and goes. (This was all caused by something called Congenital Cytomegalovirus which caused two brain bleeds shortly after birth and resulted in damage to my auditory nerve).

This hadn’t caused too many issues for me over the years, I wear CROS hearing aids and lip-read, and could usually cope with the hearing I had left in my good ear.

But about three weeks ago I lost more of my hearing in my left ear (the doctors think it was virus which has damaged my auditory nerve even further) and I’m struggling to cope.

My tinnitus is now constantly there and is SO loud (before I could just ignore it) that it wakes my up multiple times in the night and my hearing is so bad that even with my HA’s, I struggle to hear what people are saying to me.

Between the lack of sleep from the tinnitus and the tiredness from concentrating so hard on what people around me are saying, I’m exhausted. 

I’m okay in the mornings for the most part (thanks to a few cups of coffee) but by the afternoon I struggle to concentrate, can barely string a sentence together and the tension headaches are so bad and it’s so hard to get any work done after about 2pm.

Does anyone have any advice on coping with the fatigue (especially at work) or just advice in general after sudden hearing loss?

TLDR; Was partially deaf, now even more deaf and exhausted from concentrating and need advice/tips for coping with tiredness

1obhyh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1obhyh8/how_am_i_seeing_body_recognition_ai_change_the/,How Am I Seeing Body Recognition AI Change the Future?,"Imagine this: you're sitting at your desk, sipping coffee, and your computer not only recognizes your face but also understands your posture, the way you move, and even your emotional state. Sounds like science fiction? Well, it's becoming science fact, thanks to advancements in body recognition AI.

# The Rise of Body Recognition AI

Body recognition AI is no longer confined to sci-fi movies. It's rapidly becoming a part of our daily lives, from fitness apps that correct your form to telehealth platforms that monitor your rehabilitation exercises. This technology uses computer vision and machine learning to analyze human movement, posture, and gestures, providing real-time feedback and insights.

For instance, Abto Software has developed AI-based pose detection technology that enables real-time markerless motion capture. This allows for accurate skeleton tracking and human motion recognition using just the cameras on mobile devices or PCs. Such innovations are transforming industries like healthcare, sports, and entertainment by providing more personalized and efficient services.

# In-House Engineers: The Unsung Heroes

While outsourcing often grabs the spotlight, let's not forget the in-house engineers who are the backbone of these innovations. These professionals work tirelessly to develop, test, and refine AI algorithms that power body recognition systems. Their deep understanding of the technology and its applications ensures that solutions are not only effective but also ethical and user-centric.

In-house teams have the advantage of close collaboration, rapid iteration, and a deep connection to the company's mission and values. They are the ones who translate complex AI research into practical applications that improve lives.

# Real-World Applications

1. **Healthcare and Rehabilitation** Body recognition AI is revolutionizing physical therapy. By analyzing a patient's movements, AI can provide real-time feedback, ensuring exercises are performed correctly and effectively. This technology can also monitor progress over time, helping therapists adjust treatment plans as needed. Abto Software's AI-based pose detection technology is a prime example. It facilitates smooth integration with musculoskeletal rehabilitation platforms, empowering personal physical therapists to deliver more accurate and personalized care.
2. **Sports and Fitness** Athletes and fitness enthusiasts are leveraging body recognition AI to enhance performance and prevent injuries. By analyzing movements and posture, AI can identify areas for improvement and suggest corrective actions. This leads to more efficient training and better results. 
3. **Entertainment and Animation** In the entertainment industry, body recognition AI is being used for motion capture and animation. DeepMotion's Animate 3D platform, for example, allows users to generate 3D animations from video footage in seconds. This democratizes animation, enabling creators to produce high-quality content without the need for expensive equipment or specialized skills.

# The Future: Ethical Considerations and Challenges

As with any powerful technology, body recognition AI comes with ethical considerations. Privacy concerns are at the forefront, as the technology requires access to personal data, such as movement patterns and, in some cases, biometric information. It's crucial for developers and companies to implement robust data protection measures and ensure transparency in how data is collected and used.

Moreover, there's the challenge of bias in AI algorithms. If not properly trained, AI systems can perpetuate existing biases, leading to unfair outcomes. Ensuring diversity in training data and continuous monitoring of AI systems are essential steps in mitigating these risks.

# Conclusion

Body recognition AI is not just a passing trend; it's a transformative technology that's reshaping industries and improving lives. From healthcare to entertainment, its applications are vast and varied. While outsourcing plays a role in its development, the contributions of in-house engineers are invaluable in bringing these innovations to life.

As we look to the future, it's essential to approach this technology with a sense of responsibility. By addressing ethical concerns and striving for inclusivity, we can harness the full potential of body recognition AI to create a more connected and efficient world.

So, the next time your device recognizes your posture or movement, remember: it's not magic - it's the future, unfolding one frame at a time.",1,1760964041.0,OutsourceDevHub,0,1.0,False

Recently, noticed white and pink fuzzy growth. This is the 2nd time ive seen it, I threw the first bag away. It only happens in the bag, I do not see any growth in the machine. 

Is this common? I’m not sure if it’s always molded and I’ve just not noticed, or if it’s a new development. Is it a sign of bad coffee? Should I be shipping pods off right away instead of waiting for the bag to fill up? Is it fine to ship with this growth?

He also warns that today’s networks aren’t quite ready for this scale.

I can see Joyce being naive enough to accept a spiked drink from the Russian smuggler and ransom guy in Alaska, but it is very much out of character for Murray. He's the paranoid conspiracy theorist recently turned Black Belt who already distrusted Russians before the Russian invasion even happened in S3, so he should be even more distrustful and smacked that coffee out of Joyce's hand the moment she poured it.

the first question would amount to, if I used this method (which so far is working with me) but at the same time used what's called the nature method with a great little reader called Logos, will that diminish the intrinsic faults that present themselves with a purely grammar-translation approach?

the second, is the grammar-translation method really so bad when I intentionally choose to approach the language from a linguistic perspective and try to obtain a good understanding of the mechanics of the grammar itself? this leads me to believe that grammar-translation is only really a hindrance to those who wish to speak the language naturally, as one would speak their own native language as a child who has no grasp on the professional linguistic aspect of the language he speaks but still speaks it well.

8. Nagpapauwi yan sila ng Laptop para kapag Bumagyo pwede sa bahay. Pero may isang TL na onsite lahat dahil bagsak metrics nung nagpatrial sila. Ano pang sense ng pag papauwi nyo ng laptop.

got into coffee about 5 months ago — went from instant to brewing pour overs almost every morning now lol. been loving the process and realizing how deep the world of coffee actually is.

curious how coffee fits into your day — do you usually brew at home or head out to a cafe? if you brew, any favourite beans or roasteries you keep going back to?

also, what makes a cafe worth revisiting for you — the coffee itself, the vibe, music, menu, people, or something else entirely?

She had brain cancer. She died 3 months after her diagnosis and to be honest I don't think I will ever fully recover from it. But yes I had grief therapy.

When mom was alive she had this workplace rivalry with a woman ""Dora"". My mom and Dora did not get along and my mom did her best to avoid her. I remember mom saying Dora brought everyone down at the office but she did enough to keep her job so she kept her mouth shut. But things would flare whenever mom got promoted at work because Dora never did. And since Dora worked for the company longer it made her really nasty to my mom. When my mom got sick and left her job the people she worked with all signed the card except for Dora. They all showed up at the funeral except for Dora too. But you know what Dora did? She left a comment on my mom's Facebook page saying she hoped she would rot in hell and she was finally free of mom. Other coworkers saw it and told her how awful it was so she deleted it by the end of the day. But I saw it. I even screenshotted it and showed my dad. I thought it was sick. My dad said he did too.

Then 3 years later, when I was 17, he started dating Dora. He told me she wasn't a bad person and they met at a coffee shop again and just hit it off. He told me he wanted me to be happy for him and Dora made him happy and brought so much joy and light back into his life and he didn't want me to take her and mom's issues with each other out on Dora. And he was all give her a chance for me, please. He begged me to at least try one lunch with them and see if I could like her.

But I was disgusted. I told him I would never see him the same way if he could date that disgusting thing. He told me not to dehumanize her and workplace rivalry's can get heated. I said I didn't care because that comment on mom's Facebook after she died showed the kind of person she is. My dad set up a meeting between us and Dora was trying to be sweet and even wanted to hug me but I shot her down cold and said she was not allowed to ever touch me. Dad told me I was being hostile and I should give her a chance. We argued and I told dad it was Dora or me. I said he couldn't keep me in his life if he was going to be with her. 

He told me he wouldn't choose and I said that was his choice and I told him to leave me alone. I packed up my stuff and went to stay with my aunt. My dad tried to call and text and he reached out dozens of times but I blocked him and I still have him blocked today. But then gramps (his dad) gave him his phone recently and he's been contacting me through that and asking to meet up and saying he loves and misses me and he heard I was getting married and wants to come. He said he hoped I had cooled down by now and was willing to be civil to Dora (now his wife). I blocked gramps' number and never replied to the texts.

My grandma mentioned it to me when I saw her and gramps this past weekend and she asked me why I hadn't given my dad a chance to be back in my life. She said no contact for so long was bad for everyone. I told her there is no good from having a relationship with them and my dad made his choice and I refuse to be around Dora. Grandma told me I'm old enough to look past that to have a relationship with my dad. She said I'll be sorry if I don't take it once he's gone. I told her there will be zero regrets from me. She said that sounds so cold and to remember dad lost mom too and had his own feelings to think about.

For info, I'm 24, my parents are in their 60's.

Storytime: came home early from uni because I failed a test and my mood was low, and I wanted to study for my easier test on Wednesday. I come home, and my dad immediatly tells me my mom is picking a fight with him again.

According to her, he cheats on her. Proof? Nowhere.  Proven wrong? All the time.

First it was facebook and she forced him to delete his account, then it was snapchat - she found (she is actively searching for whatever proof she may find, and lately she's been spying through his phone) an account and turned out it wasn't him... she admitted to us she was wrong. Three weeks later (**today**) ? Oh, Instagram is the problem now!

The only instagram he has is one where he follows no one, made it 5 yrs ago with HER to follow my drawing account.

What happened today within the last hour: they fought, my dad slapped her(lightly, which I think is justified considering she hit him to the point of bruises a few times), she threw things at him, called him fat and obese (he's overweight so what? I don't care myself), threw a hot cup of coffee at his face...

I then proceeded to relapse unfortunately, and my dad was there for me, helped me patched it up, clean it, checked in on me... My mom? Nothing. She came upstairs a few mins later, asked ""what did you harm yourself with?"", or simply said ""i'm gonna have a bruise tommorow""(from my father slapping her)... as if YOU'RE the victim in this. Then I'm not sure what was said, but I think I heard something like ""i'm gonna stab you so you'll know pain like you caused to me"" etc..

We seriously thing she has BPD. Because 5 days ago during my birthday, all was fine!

I have currently two furniture in that space, but I don't think they look and feel good enough. Since the space is insanely small, I have no idea, if a smaller, 140 cm couch, or a bigger, maybe L-shaped 200 cm couch would be the better choice. Maybe even no couch, just two armchairs instead?

I replicated the layout in a software and I also made photos.

This is the layout of this wannabe living room space:

I know that a rug, a coffee table and a curtain would give the space a more welcoming feeling, and I'll definitely buy better one of those. But as of right now, I don't think those are enough to turn this a more welcoming space.

I'm pretty sure both the current furnitures should go away, but I have honestly no idea what should I replace them with.

This is a concept I came up with:

The couch in this concept has a 140 cm width. I placed a room divider cabinet to separate this area from the other half of the room. Also placed a rug, which has the same width as the couch. The furniture on the left side remained.

1obhimr,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1obhimr/just_pouring_out/,Just pouring out.,"A few notes first. TW Nmom, trauma dumping?, abuse, brief animal murder, I don't know what all exactly to tag, but generally, bad vibes. I'm a woman, adult, closer to middle age than young adult. I'm pretty sure I have autism but I'm not sure if I was diagnosed as a kid or not. Also, my head doesn't work right anymore, for example, I often forget how old I am unless I sit down and do the math, some days I forget which name is mine unless I make a point to think about it, and my timeframe is totally off, I was shocked yesterday to find out it's October, I thought it was February, and I kind of feel like I'm missing years. So, timeline is going to be unclear, and out of order. I'll try to make it line up, but I do have issues with that, sorry for any confusion in advance. Also, I wasn't raised like I should have been. I know how to cook, clean, fill out applications and some forms. I think my social skills have dropped off over the years. There are things I know I should know as an adult, but I never learned. When something comes up, if I can, I usually look it up right then. I say that to let you know, I don't know what all I'm doing or should be doing. I'm not looking for advice or help, I just need someone to hear me. 



So, I live with my Nmom and grandmother. For years I've been doing this thing I call ""putting myself in prison,"" which is staying in my room during the day and coming out at night to clean and cook. I've gone through phases of doing this, I think 4 phases now. This most recent one has been a year. I know my mental and physical health both plummet when I'm around my mom, but I didn't realize how badly until my most recent stent. I knew my hair was falling out, I didn't realize it was from stress, I was worried I had a medical issue or wasn't getting enough protein, but after a few months of being away from her, it's grown back. I was also stressed to the point where I couldn't form a sentence. I would sit in my room alone and try to practice talking, and I couldn't get anything out. I would try to type or write what I was thinking, and it was so jumbled. I'm better now. 

My mother has always done this thing, since I was a kid, where she would buy groceries for herself and for her other kid, and I wasn't allowed to eat them. She wouldn't tell me what I couldn't have, she never specifically said I couldn't eat, but it was enforced with beatings from her, her other kid, and my grandmother. I was accused of stealing food. I lived off of ramen and peanut butter, I still can't eat either now. I would scarf down food at babysitters houses and at school, and I would get in trouble for eating so fast. I don't really understand how, but I got obese. 

My mom didn't want me, she cried that when she found out that she was pregnant with me, she felt stuck. She told me she didn't want me. She told me one time when she was angry that she tried to abort me, my dad (awful too, but out of the picture,) also told me she tried to get rid of me, and a few family members have also implied the same. I was hospitalized for dehydration a few times as and kid and once for ""rolling off the bed,"" I am suspicious about that one. She has endless funny and sweet stories about her other kid's childhood, all she has about me is that I never stopped crying, she even implied that as an infant, I did it on purpose. She accused me of being a ""whore"" when I was 4 or 5 because neighbor kids would bring food to my window and talk to me through my window, and that's an accusation she hasn't let me live down since. She kept babysitters around who would abuse me and not question her. She cut out anybody who actually paid attention and saw that something was wrong. That's something I think about often, how she was able to find so many adults who were willing to assist, participate, or cover up. 

Her other kid also beat me regularly. I don't understand why I didn't die. They stomped on my neck, on my head, on my chest, my sternum is fucked, I have dents in my head. They did this thing where they choked me until I went purple, stopped, then did it again, they did that a few times. I asked them so many times why they would attack me, and they said because it was funny to see me in pain, and another time they said they jerked off thinking about beating me and me being scared. They also did this thing where they would catch lizards and snakes and grind them between two cinder blocks. There's no doubt that they probably turned out really bad, but I've been no contact with them for years, I don't have it in me to open that can of worms. I feel guilty about that, but I don't know what to legally do if I'm right about what my worries are, so I've been telling myself I won't look into it until I'm okay, but I don't know if that's going to happen. Her other kid enjoyed beating me, but my mother would use them to beat me too, she told me that they couldn't go to jail when they were a minor, but if I called the police on them, I would go to jail, and I believed her, lol. I was just a kid.  

My mother worked with law enforcement my whole life. I couldn't tell you how many times I've tried calling 911. Most of the time, mom would call them, or they would call her, and she would convince them not to come out. Only twice ever did they show up. The first time, I was waiting at the door, I was telling them everything, then she came to the door, told me to go inside, I said no, the COPS physically moved me inside and closed the door so they could talk to her, then they left. The second time, they saw the bruises, they nodded the whole time I was talking, then told me they were good friends with my mom, knew that she ""would never let something like that happen,"" told me that I needed to start behaving, and told me they hoped I would start getting along better with my mom. They refused to give me any papers. I think this was before body cameras. I do not remember any names. Her best friend was someone who worked with abused people, she saw what happened, and I'll never understand why she believed my mom. I know my mom put this narrative out when I was a kid that there was something wrong with me, that I was evil and that she was a poor, saintly mom who struggled with her kid but just loved me so much she couldn't bring herself to do anything with me. I don't understand how nobody could be around and NOT SEE that that didn't make sense. 

The punishments were so bizarre. When I was in first grade, I didn't do my homework, I know I should have, but I didn't, and as punishment, she started taking away my bookbag when I got home, and I wouldn't be able to do my homework, so she'd keep taking my bag as punishment, and throughout elementary and middle school, I didn't do my homework. By high school, I just didn't care. I told police, guidance counselors, teachers, gym coaches, the school nurses, school office workers, and the school resource officers all what was happening at home, and that I needed help, responses I got were they didn't believe me because I slept in class, because I didn't do my homework, because I would come to school unshowered and without my hair brushed even though her other kid came to school clean, that I wore black clothes, that a mother would never do that, that someone who worked with law enforcement would never do that, that her other kid was fine, and that girls are dramatic, and the one that hurt the most was when they believed me but didn't want to get involved. I didn't finish high school. I wasn't allowed to learn to drive because I was ""irresponsible,"" and my mother ""didn't trust me not to take off."" She doesn't know me well, but she did get that one right. 

I moved out of state to live with family, and it was the best year of my life. That family was dysfunctional, but it was so much better. I loved going outside, growing up I wasn't allowed out, I had to sneak out to play as a child, sometimes she would lock me out, then punish me for staying at a neighbor's house without permission. I ended up afraid of going outside, still am a little. But when I had moved away, I loved outside. I even loved sleeping outside. I loved talking to people. I loved getting to go run errands with family. I loved watching TV. I got punished at my mom's house, I was always grounded, I would be made to sit in the living room, I wasn't allowed to sit on the furniture, and I wasn't allowed to watch TV, but if I did look, or if they just wanted to accuse me of looking, I would get slapped or punched in the head, but out of state, I could watch TV. It was so nice. I loved eating sandwiches. It was great. The first night I was there, my family cooked for me, they asked me what I liked and my favorite school lunch was spaghetti, so that's what I said, and it was the first time anyone cooked for me, and I'll never forget it. We had spaghetti, garlic bread, and green beans, it was so much food I had it for leftovers for the next too days, I loved it! 

Technically I was still a minor, my mother drove me out of state to stay with family, to teach me a lesson. She had threatened all the time when I was a kid to send me there, the threat being that they would beat me to death. I ended up going because I finally agreed. I figured at least it would stop. Turns out, they were the good ones. The story my family and I got was that I was going to finish school there then go to college, but she put a hold on my papers with my old school and told them that I would be back in a few months. I couldn't get enrolled, and I just had a few more months before I was an adult, I think she panicked. My family members had a medical emergency, and she took the opportunity to tell me she was going to have them arrested for harboring a minor if I didn't come back. My family wasn't sure, because they knew she brought me there, and they knew what she was about, but they also knew she worked with law enforcement, and that she could make things bad. They told me I didn't have to go, but I got scared. I was still a kid, I didn't know. I agreed to go back. She lied to her people here and said I was begging to come back because I was ""being abused,"" and everybody believed her no matter what I said. 

She still wouldn't let me learn to drive. She wouldn't let me get a job because ""how would I get there."" I had to cook and do the household chores for her, her other kid, and her mom. It was bad, but that was when I started isolating myself, and that helped a lot. We had good days sometimes too. One day I was sitting with her watching tv (I wasn't not allowed to watch tv when I came back,) also, once I turned 18, the beatings almost completely stopped, and from how I understood it at the time, it was so much better, I thought things had changed, now I know that they were protecting themselves. 

Well, we were watching tv, and by that time, her other kid had started messing with heavy drugs. They were running in and out of the house, running up to the door listening, running outside and hiding under the window to listen, and we really were watching tv and not talking about them at all. Well, they got a little too tweaked, came in, and demanded I get out. I said no, and I shouldn't have. I know now it's okay to stand up for myself, but I also knew at the time what the consequences would be. They began to beat me, and the first and only time in my life, my mom put her arms out in front of me, and told them to stop. They stopped for a moment, stared at her, then punched her in the face. It was the first time they ever hit her. I still hear that wet crack, the woody thud of the headboard, and the ""umph!"" sound she made. I feel like I can feel that sound in my ear now. She called the cops, and had her other kid move out. They haven't moved back since. Shortly after that was the last time I ever saw or spoke to them. I also spoke to the police, they actually gave me papers and took pictures, they told me I needed to take them to the courthouse to press charges. My mother refused to take me for over a month, then after that, my papers ""disappeared."" That was over a decade ago. Knowing more about these things now, I know not only was she always going to protect them, I also suspect there's a little emotional incest at play, as well as HEAPS of internalized misogyny.

The last time I went to a dentist was when I was in middle school, the last time I had an eye appointment, it's been a few years, got a $10 eye exam and $60 glasses, using them now, love them. The last time I went to a gp was I think more than a decade ago. I had a medical issue where I was losing a lot of blood, my skin was turning green. It doesn't go witchy green, it just gets really pale and it looks like there's a layer of something green underneath. I also had a hard time standing up for long enough to do chores without fainting, and I did faint twice in that time. I got to the point I was staying in bed, this was my first stint. Health wasn't great, but mental health improved a LOT. I would almost pass out walking to the toilet, less than 10 feet away, I would have to sit down in the shower, I fell asleep in there a few times. Because I was sick, I wasn't able to keep up with chores. I also was not cooking anything, I didn't eat often, and when I did, it was things I could eat laying down, so like a banana, a sandwich, and so on. I wasn't generating much mess at all. The only gocha I ever got on my mother in my life was when she loved going on and on about how I never do anything, and I asked her, if that's so then why was the only time I was to sick to work the time that we got roaches and mice in our house. She didn't say anything about my not cleaning for a few years after that, but now she denies that I was ever sick, that I was faking it and being lazy.

A family friend, who was one of my old babysitters and who was also abusive when I was a kid, came and helped us clean. It took about a month, the trash had piled up across the kitchen and living room, the dishes in the sink were in black water, trash and dirty dishes all over all surfaces. Think Hoarders. I tried helping with the cleaning, and the family friend noticed I looked ill and like I was going to pass out, I told her about what was going on, she asked why I wouldn't go to the doctor, I told her I had no money, she told me I was on my mom's insurance, I told her my mom said I wasn't, I was under 26, so turns out, I was. When I was first having this problem, I told my mom, she chewed me out because I didn't have a job and couldn't pay for it, she said she couldn't afford it, then the next day she went out and bought more than $700 worth of paintings. Half of those are still in a corner on the floor. When this family friend heard all of this, she confronted my mom, who gave her a different story, and she told me, so I said let's all have one conversation so we're all on the same page. 

When we sat down, mom told her she offered to take me to the doctor, but I was too lazy to go and wouldn't call to make an appointment, I said that's not true, I asked if I would make an appointment right then would she take me, she said yes. All of this was Infront of family friend. I called, made the appointment, my mom was red, and really did start to sweat. We picked a day, mom tried to say the family friend would be there to clean on that day so I should choose a different one, but the family friend told her that she wanted to be there to make sure I got to my appointment. Morning of, mom tried to pull the emotional manipulation, begged me not to go because she couldn't afford it and because she had a headache, I reminded her that our family friend had offered to pay. The three of us went, they dropped me off at the dr, for my appointment. I paid $15 for the appointment. I called mom to pick me up, she refused to answer. I called the family friend, she answered, told mom, and mom started fussing about how I didn't call her, and family friend told her she could see her phone. The prescription cost $35. She was paying family friend $400 a week to help us with our home. After a week or so, I was already doing a lot better. I was able to stay on top of chores after that. Mom went no contact with that family friend after that. I don't know how to feel. That family friend did abuse me, but she also helped me out so much. 

So, I've had two real jobs in my life. The first one was at a department store, I loved it. I had looked for jobs before that, but my mom worked against me. I'm so grateful that this community exists, because EVERYBODY in my life who I've tried to talk to about my mom working against me cannot wrap their heads around that. But when I would fill out applications, she would refuse to take me to interviews and would instruct my grandmother not to take me. A friend took me to the one I did get, and I didn't tell my mom about that interview or when I got it, it was a few months before she found out. 

The only bank account I had at the time was a joint one we opened before I had moved, when I was a minor. That's where I was getting my pay deposited at. I know better now, but I was still young at that time. She found my work uniform, then checked the account. I found out she found out when I went to go use my debit card and the account was empty. I was using my money for work clothes, toiletries, groceries, giving gas money to friends and my grandmother, or buying food in exchange for gas money for friends or grandmother, and paying the water and trash bill to my grandmother. I had a few thousand in my account, maybe 2? All gone. I confronted her, she denied it, so I told her I was going to file a report with the bank, she went off. She took it all for rent and bills, said I owed her for all of my childhood and the few adult years too. So, what I started doing was waiting by the atm on payday, and taking out all but $215, $200 for bills, $15 to leave a balance in the account so there wouldn't be a fee. I also kept paying water and trash bills to my grandmother. When I worked on payday, she would take it all but $15. I lost my cool, started spending money as soon as the check showed up as pending, bought gift cards, ordered groceries, way over spent, but it was the only way I could get stuff done. Would leave enough for the $15 balance and the $30 overdraft fee. Nothing for bills for her. I was in the wrong for that. I know she was wrong too, but I wasn't innocent, I did shit wrong too. I did know better than to not try to help with bills. 

After that, she sabotaged me. She cut off my phone so I couldn't call friends or uber, and she instructed my grandmother not to take me to work. My grandmother let me use her phone twice, then my mom told her not to anymore after that. I asked the neighbors by me, one didn't answer, one asked a lot of questions about why my mom and grandmother wouldn't help before telling me she didn't want to get involved, another let me use her phone twice before telling me she didn't feel comfortable helping me anymore. I'm not upset with them, it wasn't their business, and I appreciate that the one did help me out. She would cut my phone on and off, because she still needed it as a leash for me. She had moved out before that.

So, where I was working, I wasn't making bank by any means. But there was one house, it was within walking distance to where I worked, it was down the road from a jail, there was a hole in the floor, another on the back porch, a busted window, a missing interior door. It wasn't great, but I could have afforded it over 10 years. I was thrilled. I set up an appointment with a realtor, huge mistake. She knew my mom, called her, friendly gabbed, and my mom decided to go with me. I was a legal adult at that time, she tried to tell the realtor not to take me, I told the realtor I would go with someone else, so we went. Even though the house was messed up, some of the issues I knew how to fix, and for others, I knew a few people who could help. It would have been mine, and I would have been a huge leap closer to freedom. The realtor tried to convince me that I didn't want it, that I would want a nice apartment that would cost more monthly, I wanted the house. I filled out paperwork, one for a bank loan, gave to the realtor. I didn't know mom had asked her to wait before putting it in.

So

That night, mom hugged me and pet my arm, that gave me the creeps so bad, it still puts my stomach in knots thinking about it. I hated her false affection. It feels like cobwebs on the inside. Anyway, she bawled her eyes out. It was the hardest I've seen her cry since she got hit by her other kid, and those were the only two times I ever saw her cry like that. I fell for it. She told me not to leave her behind, she needed my help, she was going to move away from her mom, and she needed me to go with her and help with bills. I felt so bad for her. I know better now, I wish I had buckled all the way down back then. I think that was my window, I really think I missed it.

We went apartment hunting after that, of course any that I said I liked she dislike, even if she liked it first. She picked the one I hated and wasn't walking distance to my work. She said she had put papers in on it, I asked why I wasn't involved with that, she went off on me about how she doesn't owe me anything, and that I don't dictate her. So, a few weeks go by, she tells me she's leaving for a beach trip for the weekend, and that she would be back on Monday. I don't hear from her all weekend, and she didn't come home Monday. I started calling, she wasn't home Tuesday either. I called her friends, her best friend, the one who worked with abused people, chewed me out and called me a liar because she didn't believe that my mom had moved out and that she didn't tell me, and told me that I was being deceitful, and disrespectful for implying that my mom would do that. But yeah, she had moved out and in with another friend of hers. Honestly, except for the paycheck and phone issues with her, second most peaceful time in my life. 

Anyway, she cut off my phone sporadically and forbid my grandmother from helping me. I lost my job for too many days missed. I loved that job, I still miss it. I'm pretty heartbroken about that time in my life. That was the best it ever got, and if I had made better decisions, I would have been better off.

The second and last job I ever had was at another store, I was there for 7 months. Again, went behind her back for the interview, grandmother took me. I was there for 2 months before mom found out. I still don't know how she found out. Same as before, took all my pay, so I switched over to getting checks sent in the mail. My grandmother was the only one who checked the mail at the time, so I got my checks, until mom confronted her, asked her if I was getting checks in the mail, hindsight I know now that my grandmother was afraid of her too. I feel so bad. My grandmother also beat me and lied against me to make herself look good, she wasn't great, but now I know she was scared too. Anyway, my mom would take my checks, from her, do the picture deposit thing, then seal my check back up and leave it for me. I got in trouble with the bank twice, they warned me I could be charged with check fraud. So, I started picking up my check from HR day after payday. Mom cut my shit off and told grandmother not to take me to work or to use her phone. I gave my grandmother my check, had her go cash it on her own when she was running errands, and use it to buy me a prepaid phone and a card. I was able to keep getting rides to work for a while after that, I don't know how she found out about that phone. I was showering one day, and when I came out, it was gone. I went off, I searched her room, the living room, and everything I could think of. She sat there and really tried her best villain laugh, like sincerely. Big cringe. I couldn't get to work and couldn't communicate. I lost my job.

I had stashed away over $3k in my wall. That disappeared too. I just counted; I have exactly $2.71 right now. All coins, no quarters. All gift cards are gone or have been used and left empty. I had a few hundred total between money and cards just a few years ago. I used one once to buy dinner for mom when she got home from a long trip. At my first job, I got two credit cards. One was a store card, the other was a regular credit card. I was keeping up with them and building my credit, I was on top of it. When I got fired from my first job, I had less than $50 owed on each, but I had no money to pay, and no more income. So, one had a limit of $750, the other was $1,200. They maxed out on fees. When I had my second job, I was paying on both. The $750 one, I had about $80 left to pay, the $1,200 one, I had about $230 left. I couldn't finish paying. They re-maxed out. I regret so much.

In addition to my own credit faults, I know my mom has opened SEVERAL credit cards with my information. She's been doing it since I was a kid. I know she'll use her or her other kid's information in place of mine, but always my name and ssn. I've asked her to close them, got chewed out again for trying to ""dictate her."" I checked all three credit bureaus yesterday, it says I only have a hospital debt under my name. I know something's not right with that, because I know she still has a few cards in her wallet with my name on them, and I know two specifically which types of cards they are, but I don't understand why my credit report didn't show those. I don't know.

So, about driving. I don't know how to.  
I went behind her back and got my first permit in my early 20's with a different family friend who I was cleaning house for and babysitting for at the time. She took me driving a few times. She was visiting with my mom and told her, my mom cried and told her that was something special that she should get to do with me, and the family friend didn't want to take me driving anymore after that. She didn't want to get involved. Right before that permit expired, another friend started teaching me to drive (stick shift! v cool!) and when the permit did expire, he took me to renew it, gave me the money for the test. She cut off my phone when she found out I was going off with friends, so we would just make plans in person and stick to them. Well, we fell off eventually. Permit expired. Third permit I got was years later, my mom was telling everyone I refused to learn to drive. I talked my grandmother into taking me to get my test for my permit, she agreed, and she took me driving a few times. I told her I wanted to surprise mom, but I wanted to wait until I had my license. She agreed, but mom was waiting for us at home one day, I thought she had left for work already. She was pissed. She asked us where we had been, gma blurted out that we had been driving. Mom told gma that I didn't have a permit, then gma admitted that she had taken me to get one. She seethed. She didn't say anything else. My grandmother went to her room, I stayed in the living room, I was afraid to leave the room. Mom sat for a few more minutes, then got up and went to gma's room. She went off. Full on screaming, cussing, threatening. My grandmother didn't feel comfortable taking me driving after that, I did then and still do completely understand. My fourth permit, when the family friend was helping us clean, before the doctor's appointment, she had taken me to get my permit. She asked my mom when I could go driving, my mom snapped at her, and she didn't mention it again. That one expired too. 

When my mom got her diagnosis (I'll talk about this later,) she took me to get my 5th permit. The day of, in the parking lot of the DMV, she started begging me to get an ID instead, said the permit would take too long, and that she didn't feel well. I lied and said okay and got my permit anyway. She didn't speak to me for a week. Family started hounding me about not having my license, I was in my late 20's. I told them about my permit but that nobody would take me driving, mom had told my grandmother not to take me. They confronted her, she lied and told them I refused. Again, group conversation, and suddenly, progress. She agreed to pay for me to go get lessons but would only let me go through this one place. When I got there, I understood why. She was friends with the people who ran the place, and the woman scolded me and told me that my mother told her all about me. 

I would go on a driving lesson, schedule the next lesson, then I would get home, and mom would be pissed. At the time, I figured she'd find something and stew on it until I got home, now I understand it's just her issues. She would scream at me that I wasn't allowed to use her card, she would cut off my phone, she would cut off the card. Then days, weeks, or months later, she would confront me about why I hadn't been on another lesson, I would tell her about the card/phone thing, she would cut them back on if she had cut it off, then insist that it never happened. Never got enough hours. Permit expired. Went with gma to get my sixth one a few years after that. It expired a few years after that. Nobody believed me that she wouldn't let me learn to drive, everybody believes her that I was too lazy. It drives me nuts.

As far as support for me, I'm out.   
As a kid, I had lots of friends in school, but I wasn't allowed to see them outside of school. There were a few times I could, but only around my mom. When I was younger, I didn't understand why things always went bad, but looking back, I get it. She only let me have friends over or visit with friends if she could control things. She made other kids and their parents uncomfortable with being my friend. So that didn't really work until middle school, I had a friend, her mom worked in a field that overlapped with my mom's work, apparently, she knew my mom was a little off, but she played nice so I could hang out with them. I got to be friends with her until I moved. My mom had blocked her number from my account, honestly, it wasn't a priority to solve because there was so much else going on.

I had got in touch with a friend in my early 20's and stayed with her for a while, I was such an ass. I didn't help with chores. I kind of just sat or slept. She was the one who helped me get my first job. I regret not treating her and her roommates better. I picked a fight with one, I don't even remember what about, I think I shoved him, I was such a little psycho. My mom was boo-hooing at the same time that she needed me to move back with her so I did. I don't know what my problem was. I think I was anxious, waiting for something to happen, and when it didn't, I got more anxious. I wish I had been a better friend. 

As for the three family friends I knew, all of them offered to help until my mom talk to them, then they didn't want to get involved.

Dad's side of family, mom stirred shit for them, called the cops on one of their kids, called CPS on their kid, they didn't do anything wrong, made reports on them. I think in her head, it was revenge for not being bad to me? Like, proving her wrong. I haven't spoken to any of them in years, I don't even know how to get in touch. 

At my first job, made lots of friends, did well there, loved it. Once I lost my job and phone service, keeping in touch was difficult, and I couldn't afford to go anywhere, we were young adults, so being a broke flake didn't work out. Same with friends I had made outside of work. Couldn't keep in touch, couldn't afford to go anywhere. I haven't spoken to a friend in years. Second job, didn't really make friends. Kind of clocked in, I was friendly, but that place definitely felt like just a job. I still showed up and did my best. Didn't make friends outside, too much going on.

Only saw family friends a few times after that.

As far as family on her side, they just don't believe me, they don't want to get involved, and more than half of them I haven't met. One of my aunts, I've seen I think only 3 times in my life. The aunt who's closest has seen me actually getting beaten and because I fought back, I pushed O. kid off of me, I was on the ground, I was trying to put my feet up so he couldn't keep stomping on me. Because I was fighting back, she said we were both fighting. Mom had already put it in her head that I was bad. I just don't get how she saw, several times, whole attacks go down, and how she could reason with herself that something else was happening. I asked her for help yesterday on the phone, she told me she think's my mom is a wonderful person, that I need to compromise. I have no hope for getting help from family.

Grandmother, her mind's been going for years now. I have such mixed feelings about her. With the hindsight I have now, I know she was scared and putting herself first. I also know she was awful about some things. Idk if this makes sense, but since her mind has gone, I kind of just don't feel angry at her anymore. I don't talk to her really. It's been maybe two years since I talked to her. I also know now a lot of things we were angry at each other about were things mom had told us. Mom is so unfair towards gma. I feel so bad for her.  I don't have anyone else. There are 8 numbers in my phone, one is the driving instructor, one is my mother's dr.'s office.

My mom got a terminal diagnosis a few years ago. I know I shouldn't have felt this way, but I thought it was going to be my way out. I know I need a lot of help, but I really think I could make good progress if I just didn't have anybody working against me. I kept up with the chores and with helping my mom. Prior to her diagnosis, I was already doing dishes, taking out the trash, vacuuming once a month, sweeping regularly, mopping once every two months, doing household linens, sometimes helping with her laundry, cooking her meals. The only line I drew was I wouldn't clean her bathroom because the last time I had, she had laughed so hard and for so long about me cleaning her toilet, she was so giddy about humiliating me. It hurt my feeling so badly, I was just trying to help my mom out. I wouldn't clean her bathroom anymore. And I was vacuuming and dusting her room, taking out her room trash, sometimes washing her bedding and making her bed. After the diagnosis, same deal, I would do her laundry the whole time, and she decided to pay a landscaper to add in a bunch of plants and build an outdoor patio (wtf?) so I took on watering plants and sweeping/leaf blowing the patio, and cleaning patio furniture.

When she would get sick on herself, I would clean it, help her get cleaned up, clean her clothes, clean her bedding, so on. She would do this fake performance, where she always tried to make things look worse for her. They were bad, she is actually sick, but she always tried to make it worse. When she would get sick on her bed, she would want to lay on it and cry, so she could look so sad. I would make her sit in her chair so I could clean her bed, and she really resented me for that. She would TEAR out hair from her head and cry about balding, but she would call me into the room and make me stand in front of her before she did so I could see it. She would fake shake her arms, and pretend to pass out. She also decided to take up drinking and binging on junk food right after her dr told her not to do either. She was never big on either of those before. She also started using 3-5 vapes at once. Her hair's grown back now (she shaved it regularly, but it was thinning significantly,) but I can tell she has taken scissors to it and chopped at it to make it look worse. There are jagged and blunt lines that wouldn't be there if it was growing back. I don't think she has Munchausen's, I think she's just bored. She's big time a psycho. She leaves me out of the loop about her medical stuff. I either don't get told anything or get told different from what she's telling others.

She's getting better. She looks to be the same weight she was before she got sick, and her hair is about shoulder length now. I feel like it's bad to say, but this makes me feel so helpless. I really thought that would be my way out.

It's been a while since she's bough meat or produce, and it's been months since she's bought groceries I'm allowed to eat. I told her I wouldn't be doing anymore work until I had groceries and coffee. That was about a week ago, but it had been longer since I had eaten daily. I know she can afford both because she eats fast food almost every day, and buys expensive lunches for her other kid. I have been going days without eating, trying to ration what I could. I took some leftover cabbage stew out of the freezer and ate it the night before last. I had enough energy, and I had been reasoning with myself for weeks. I put in a grocery order with one of the cards that had my name on it. I got up, made a cup of tea, and got to work. She got up, and I told her I was going to catch up on the chores. and that I had put in an order. She told me she was going to mark it as fraudulent; I told her I would not do work if there was no food. She told me to go for it. I stopped working. I called my aunt. I figured if before when I had confronted her with other people and made progress, then it could work again. That's when this aunt told me she thinks my mom is wonderful, and that I need to compromise. I didn't realize it was Sunday when I called. After I got off the phone with her, I had called social services, they weren't open. I'll call again today if my phone is still on. I just feel so helpless. My worry is even if I get into programs, how many friends does this demon have!? I don't believe I'll be able to get help and that she won't interfere, and I don't believe people will believe me. I feel so lost. I feel like it's not even worth trying.

I wish I could get up in the morning, have a cup of coffee or tea, sit outside, have a light breakfast. Then do the dishes, get dressed, and go to work. I would be happy working from 10 am - 6 pm, then coming home, making a little dinner, sweeping, maybe folding some laundry. Getting a shower, putting on clean clothes. and going to sleep in a clean bed. Maybe on my days off I could meal prep, go on walks, maybe I'd have a pet. I'd light a scented candle and do some deep cleaning. Maybe I could garden. I just wish things were different. I wish I would have gone for that house. 

That's all. I feel so relieved getting to just get this all out. I've never been able to tell anyone everything before.  Ok, have a nice day, bye!",1,1760962757.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False
1obhiez,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1obhiez/how_can_i_make_this_small_corner_look_like_a/,How can I make this small corner look like a living room?,"I just moved into a new apartment, which has a small, roughly 4.5 m² space, which I want to transform into a living room.

I have currently two furniture in that space, but I don't think they look and feel good enough. Since the space is insanely small, I have no idea, if a smaller, 140 cm couch, or a bigger, maybe L-shaped 200 cm couch would be the better choice. Maybe even no couch, just two armchairs instead?

I replicated the layout in a software and I also made photos.

This is the layout of this wannabe living room space:

https://preview.redd.it/oh0szexc09wf1.png?width=378&format=png&auto=webp&s=466cff0fc7ced6795a9228a2e9cc15dc16e2365a

This is the room in its current state:

https://preview.redd.it/dtuxqqvh09wf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41eaed9e9eab72f1a436f99736e909c773037263

I know that a rug, a coffee table and a curtain would give the space a more welcoming feeling, and I'll definitely buy better one of those. But as of right now, I don't think those are enough to turn this a more welcoming space.

I'm pretty sure both the current furnitures should go away, but I have honestly no idea what should I replace them with.

This is a concept I came up with:

https://preview.redd.it/dwb4xwzj39wf1.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=24f989ae63ef292e5a90dd2b6a855a0f8698cd99

The couch in this concept has a 140 cm width. I placed a room divider cabinet to separate this area from the other half of the room. Also placed a rug, which has the same width as the couch. The furniture on the left side remained.

Does anyone have an idea how to transform this place into a living room?",1,1760962739.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. SKIYE - Walkman [Selfreleased]**  
*Recommended if you like: Grafix, Rova, Pirapus*  

Sure, _Dimension_ came back from his incredibly long hiatus, and _Metrik_ dropped another banger single, but I'd much rather introduce a whole new character into your Dancefloor vocabulary: **SKIYE**! Pronounced sky, by the waiye. 

**1.1. This is not a drill (2002 - 2023)**

While perhaps a new name to you, Kilian Braun, residing in the gorgeous metropolis that is Vienna, has of course been around for much longer than just the couple of months that you have mayhaps heard his music being played out. Once grown out of his Pixel Gun 3D phase, he got sucked into the vortex of all things Jump Up, and before he knew it, he was producing some of it himself. In 2019, at a mere 16 years of age, his first artist alias was born: **Skydrill**. In no time at all, Kilian was flinging out disgusting dub pack after disgusting dub pack, filthy freebie after filthy freebie, and savage single after savage single on the likes of _Railbreakers_ and _Sub Motionz_, both solo and in collaborative fashion with _Envy_ (not that one), _Hamses_, _Amnesia_, and none other than _Master Error_! 

Further into the 2020s, he continued his hot streak of Jump Up bangers, adding collaborations with _Tremmor_, _Temple_, _Maurizzle_, _Noir_, _Shifu_ and _Fello_ to the murderous mix, and entering some more bootleg territory, with his reworks of _Southstar_'s 'Miss You' and _John Summit_'s 'Where You Are'. As you can perhaps already tell from those last two, his own tastes slowly but surely morphed away from his all-filth all-jump-up origins, to a more melodic place in the genre - something had to change.

**1.2. Look at the SKIYE (2024 - 2025)**

As soon as the clock struck 2024, Kilian announced his new musical venture: **SKIYE**! While his new-found love for melodic Dancefloor and even Liquid drum & bass is cited as one of the main reasons for this rebrand of his, he also assured his long-time fans that Jump Up still had a big place in his heart, and just a couple months later, he clarified just that, with the monstrous filth spewer that is _Soundwaves_. However, he still did actually go and deliver some loveliness over the next couple of months and years, through his series of _SKIYE SUMMER REMIXES_ and all sorts of reworks of classic bangers like _Say My Name_, or new ones like _Where You Are_. 

While already rather successful with these, especially when it came to streaming numbers, he still hadn't quite cracked the code to get his music played out by DJs - but that changed pretty quickly. Not only has he crossed the threshold from banging bootleggery to lovely originals with his contributions on Liquicity's _Ridmic_ and _DnB Allstars_' recent _Size Up_ compilation, earlier this year his bootleg of _John Summit_'s 'light years' could also be heard all over the world, thanks to support by none other than _Kanine_ and _Delta Heavy_. I took a clip of that one at Let It Roll, because I thought it was a new Delta Heavy banger! 

Now, we celebrate the arrival of yet another DJ favourite: **Walkman**!

**1.3. Walkman**

Teased in an ID showcase post back in April, and played out by more DJs than I could care to count while scrolling through Kilian's _Tagged In_ tab, **Walkman** is perhaps his biggest tune yet. Merging his Jump Up sensibilities, here brought to life via the senses-overwhelming squelch, the simple yet effectively commanding vocal snippets, and the forward-driving drum action, with his new-found melodic streak and the all-around modern sound we got going on, in this case represented by the bassy yet euphoric vocal response to all the above, Walkman walks the fine line between filthy and beautiful rather perfectly... man! 

**1.4. Conclusion**

Large, dramatic and all-around epic, while also stupidly filthy, squelchy, and bassface-coercing - it's a SKI-YES from me.

Other bangers from this week:  
- KRITIKAL - Gangsta Life VIP  
- Dimension - Hardest D Style EP  
- Various Artists - Future Fire Vol.8 (Viper Presents)  
- NVADRZ & ALIAS - Bye Bye

- Innova, Jess Robyn - Gone 💎

####**2. Xtinctor, Jakke Chase - Wide Awake [Automata Music]**  
*Recommended if you like: Delirium., DETECX, Onetral*  

Hola! ... I'll stop any further attempts at Spanish from myself right then and there. Instead, let's honour the wonderful, supremely underrated drum & bass music coming from the iberian peninsula, especially as of late, with a spotlight of Barcelonian up-and-comers **Xtinctor** and **Jakke Chase**, and their collaborative banger on the one and only **Automata Music**! 

**2.1. Xtinctor**

The first xciting new name from the Head and Hearth of Catalonia I intend to introduce to you is Javier Lara Bellido, better known as **Xtinctor**! While his mom still thinks he does 'Yoga music', his background actually takes us into the wide realms of EDM. Since 2019, he dabbled in everything from Tech and Future House to Pop-y EDM, either self-releasing or working with Spanish labels like _CHARGE RCRDS_, and earning himself support by names like _Pink Panda_, _TripleM_, _Uri Farre_, _Danny Valen_, _Pepe Cano_. With more experience came more opportunities to work with other artists like _Azzer_, _Skyles_, _L3ss_, _Artesimo_, _Lanova_ and _Toxic Wraith_, and through his bootleg work he even managed to snag an upload to the legendary _Future House Music_ channel! Further along, he used his tune reworking talents to participate in remix competitions for _Kryder_ and _Matteo Lika_, the latter of which he actually emerged victorious from! 

The bigger his network grew, the more he wanted to bring all the talented people he knew together, and showcase what they are all capable of. So in 2024, he and a few friends (we'll get to that) created **Underdogs TV**! Through weekly mix uploads to their YouTube channel, and lots of behind-the-scenes and -decks footage, the platform consistently gives glimpses into Spain's electronic music scene, and with their **Rave Lab** event series, they even put on their own shows - with a bit of an experimental touch. 

So what does any of this have to do with DnB, you ask? Well, it turns out 2024 was also the year of a bigger shift in Javier's sound. Inspired by _Fox Stevenson_ and spurred on even further by Automata's _BALA_, he not only bootlegged _Bad Bunny_ into DnB, but released his debut on the fresh Spanish label, **Lullaby**! Deciding to go all-in on the drums and the basses, Javier has since then gone on to put his own spin on tunes by _Zedd_, _Aitana_ and _NBC9_, work together with Japanese talent _YASUKI_ and fellow Spaniards _Lexed_ and _Jrace & Albert White_, and release on labels like _Play Me_ and even _DnB Allstars_, while simultaneously becoming one of _Automata_'s core members and sharing the stage with _Andromedik_, _Futurebound_, _Freaks & Geeks_ and more! Oh and one more thing: His debut _Lullaby_ was remixed by a certain _Jakke Chase_, I wonder who that is.

**2.2. Jakke Chase**

Oh yeah, right! Similar to Javier, the backstory of fellow Barcelonian producer Arnau Abadia Quinto, aka **Jakke Chase**, is _steeped_ in explorations of all things EDM and House. Whether it was his bootleggery of _Laidback Luke_, _Felix Jaehn_, _D3EPANK_, _Zhou_, or the _Wii Sports_ theme, or his various, numerous originals on the likes of _Sick Bedroom Records_ (what a name), _Jandex_, and _CHARGE RCRDS_, Arnau has been delivering _constant_ musical goodness since kicking off this journey in 2018. Come 2022, he expanded his genre repertoire further and further, with both Future Bass and Future House entering the fold on imprints like _Chill Planet_ and _TURNT_ (only great label names today), but in 2023, most of his sonic adventures were distributed by himself - and featured his very own singing voice! Always keeping the sonic evolution going throughout his prolific life as an artist, Arnau also tried his hands at Stutter House, before finally becoming a massive UK Garage head earlier this year. Fun fact, he was also one of 10 Spanish artists to attend Martin Garrix's _JBL Music Academy_! 

Outside of purely discographic evolution, however, he was also growing his network of artist friends, like when he met this guy called **Xtinctor** back in 2020! That's right, you probably figured it out by now: Arnau was another one of the friends who founded **Underdogs TV** together. As such, it only made sense that he would join in on the _Automata_ fun and remix Javier's debut, _Lullaby_, into his first-ever DnB tune - with his second having followed this very week. So let's dive into that!

**2.3. Wide Awake**

Screaming our way into the experience, **Wide Awake** does to our minds what the title promises if this one comes on in shuffle mode, but we quickly go back to soothing atmospheric work, where various vocalisations float through our mental sky, while the sunny synths begin to swell. Sooner rather than later, the vocal takes on a more coherent form, building up the melodic hype further and further, until the duo unleashes the star of the show: the fluttery, stuttery, futuristic synth line! With a little bit of boom-tschack and roaring bass, you don't need much more to make the heart a-flutter. As the vocal commands it, we are being taken higher, up a couple of energy levels and keys at least, in the delayed second drop, putting a most wonderful cap on this short but sweet journey of a tune.

**2.4. Conclusion**

Uniquely uplifting, delivered by two artists and one label you ought to be paying more attention to.

Other techy vibes from this week:  
- Various Artists - 10 Years of Soulvent: The Remixes  
- Revolve - Underburn / The Tower 💎  
- LoveTheEND - You Know How 💎  
- Eth:er - Tempus 💎

1obhhf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1obhhf3/i_think_i_want_to_be_a_janitor/,I think I want to be a janitor,"I’ve worked a lot of different jobs, all of them dealing with the public or people in some way. I worked at a school, a daycare, a before/after school program. I’ve bartended, waitressed, and worked at coffee shops as a barista. Now I’m a licensed hairdresser and after working at a salon for a few months I’ve decided that while I love doing hair, I really dislike people :( 

When I worked at the school I was always jealous of the custodians there, because they got to answer calls and just clean, fix things, and mind their business. I’m a very fast and thorough cleaner and always have been. Pretty much every job I’ve had (aside from the school) lacked custodians which meant I had to do a laundry list of cleaning in addition to my more social job duties. The cleaning part was always very peaceful to me and gave me solace from having to talk to other people. 

I grew up with social anxiety due to autism which makes it hard for me to read people and know what they’re thinking. I’ve learned how to compensate and mask extremely well, but I’m just exhausted and burnt out with it. I’d love a job that plays to my strengths instead of having to constantly compensate for my shortcomings. 

I’m also at the point where I’m turning 26 and I need a job that offers benefits. Hairdressing jobs that offer health and dental are very scarce. Even if I did janitorial work full time and just did hair on the side, that would be fine. But the health insurance is particularly important to me because I need constant help with my mental health. I’d also prefer a job that’s more physical than mental so I still have the mental bandwidth to write when I get home, as writing fiction is sort of my special interest and I get very upset when I can’t do it daily. 

tl;dr am I correct in assuming a custodian/janitor is a good job for an introvert? How do I find a job as a school custodian ? ",3,1760962665.0,jobs,2,1.0,False

I’m Marco, 30M from Italy, and I’ll be moving to Finland soon for work (Oulu, to be exact!). I thought it’d be nice to get to know a few people before the move, maybe someone who can give me some tips about life up north, or just chat about random stuff while I get ready for the big change.  
  
By day I’m a chemistry postdoc, which mostly means long hours staring at structures and occasionally talking to Python scripts like they’re coworkers. Outside the lab, I’m into all the classic nerdy goodness: anime, manga, video games, and especially Magic: The Gathering (Commander players, where you at?). I’ve been spending a lot of time on Monster Hunter Wilds lately, so if you need a hunting partner, hit me up!  
  
I also play bass (emo/core is my thing), love cooking (homemade pizza is serious business in this household), and recently realized I really enjoy going to the cinema, there’s something great about getting lost in a big screen story. Oh, and if politics ever come up: I’m solidly on the left.  
  
If you’re into gaming, music, science tangents, food pics, movie recs, or just some casual conversation to pass the time, feel free to drop a message. Would be great to chat, and maybe even grab a coffee once I’m in Finland! ",1,1760962561.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Although the kits are no longer available, I am planning to create my own CAD models and have the parts machined (material TBD, likely aluminum).

We typically drink cold brew, but occasionally use a small Cuisinox moka pot when something stronger is called for, which requires a much finer grind. Yes, it would probably be easier and cheaper to buy a different grinder, but I like this machine and my engineer brain enjoys manufacturing projects like this.

Couple questions for the hive mind:

- I believe previous kits were made to adapt the Mazzer Mini burrs. Is there a better option these days that is still cost-effective?
- Would I be better served by moving on to a newer model and forgetting about this altogether?

They say the camera never lies… but I’ve learned it tells stories. Sometimes it captures truth, sometimes imagination, but always a little piece of the person in front of it.

I’m a photographer from Ireland with a love for cinematic storytelling — portraits, travel, and the kind of moments that make life feel a bit more vivid. My work often explores confidence and emotion, and I’m lucky to meet amazing people who trust me to capture both.

Off-camera, I’m inked, music-obsessed, and always chasing a good book or a good laugh. You’ll usually find me wandering with a camera in hand, coffee in the other, or getting lost in a playlist that matches my mood. I love deep chats, dry humour, and those spontaneous plans that turn into great stories later.

I’m here hoping to meet someone kind, curious, and creative — someone who enjoys connection for what it is, whether that’s long talks, shared ideas, or maybe collaborating on something artistic.

So tell me — what’s the story you’d want to capture if someone pointed a lens your way?",0,1760962465.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.25,False
