I've tried brewing with my moka pot and also used the beans for filter coffee. The filter coffee was unbelievably good, hitting all the right notes. I still need to fine-tune my moka pot recipe since it's a bit inconsistent, but I’m already loving the results.

Even though I got what’s often considered the cheapest and maybe the ""worst"" grinder out there, I genuinely feel the difference. I totally get now why people invest serious money in their coffee gear—it’s a whole new experience.

1gbnkrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gbnkrv/dream_house/,Dream house,"I have always loved this house. From the moment I first saw it, sitting there at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, I knew it was my dream home. It had everything—a wraparound porch with a swing, a sprawling lawn with a giant oak tree in the back, and just enough space to feel cozy but not cramped. Pale blue siding, white trim, and flowers that Laura had planted along the walkway. It was perfect.

It was the kind of place where we were supposed to build our lives together.

We moved in when Sarah was born, and it felt like the start of everything. Me, Laura, Sarah, and then Michael came along a few years later. Our family grew, and so did our happiness. Every corner of this house was filled with memories—Sarah’s first steps in the living room, Michael’s messy paintings on the fridge, Laura laughing in the kitchen as she burned another batch of cookies.

It felt like a picture-perfect life. I told myself every day how lucky I was. A beautiful wife, two kids, a nice job—everything a man could want.

But lately… something’s been off.

It’s hard to put into words, really. Small things at first. Laura seemed distant, like she wasn’t really there. I’d try to talk to her about her day, but she’d shrug, barely looking up from her phone. The warmth that used to be in her voice, her laugh, it was gone. She still did all the usual things—made dinner, drove the kids to school—but something had shifted.

I told myself it was stress. We’d been married for years, and people change. Maybe she was tired. Maybe I was reading too much into it. But the feeling kept creeping in, like a splinter under the skin.

Sarah, my sweet little girl, was turning thirteen. She used to be so bubbly, always telling me about her day, excited about school. Now, when I asked how things were going, she just shrugged or mumbled something under her breath, then stormed off to her room. She started locking herself away for hours, barely coming out for dinner. The way she looked at me… there was something new in her eyes. Something cold.

Michael, too. He was always a quiet kid, but he seemed to be retreating into himself more and more. He’d sit at the breakfast table, staring at his cereal, not even looking up when I spoke. I’d ask him if he wanted to toss a ball around after school, and he’d just shake his head, muttering a vague excuse before disappearing into his room.

The mornings started feeling wrong. We’d all be sitting around the table, but there was no conversation, no life. Just silence. Laura would sip her coffee, staring out the window, lost in thought. Sarah would scroll through her phone, occasionally rolling her eyes at something, but never looking at me. Michael… well, he was just there, silent, like a shadow.

I’d sit there, sipping my own coffee, staring at the three of them, and I’d feel this growing distance. Like there was an invisible barrier between us, something I couldn’t quite name but could feel.

It wasn’t always like this, was it?

Then came the night when I came home late. I had been stuck at work, tied up in some project, and by the time I pulled into the driveway, it was already dark. The house was eerily silent when I stepped through the door.

“Laura?” I called out, my voice echoing through the hallway.

No answer.

I flicked on the lights, moving from room to room. The living room was empty. The kitchen—empty. I started up the stairs, my stomach knotting with unease.

“Sarah? Michael?”

Nothing.

I pushed open Sarah’s bedroom door. Her bed was made, her room neat and tidy, but there was no sign of her. Michael’s room was the same—everything in place, but no Michael.

I made my way to the master bedroom, expecting to find Laura asleep, but when I stepped inside, the bed was untouched. It looked like it hadn’t been slept in at all.

A strange feeling washed over me—something cold, heavy. I stood there in the silence, staring at the empty bed, my heart racing.

Where the hell was everyone?

I went back downstairs, pacing the living room, staring at the family photos on the walls. Pictures of us at the beach last summer, Laura holding Sarah when she was a baby, me smiling beside them. But as I looked closer, something seemed off about the photos.

In one of them, Laura’s face seemed blurred, her features smudged. Sarah and Michael’s faces were there, but something about them was… wrong. Their expressions seemed different, like they weren’t smiling anymore. I blinked and looked again, and the photo was normal, everything in its place. But the unease remained.

I tried to shake it off, tried to convince myself that I was overreacting. Families go through rough patches, right? Maybe I was just imagining things.

But then, the next morning, it got worse.

I woke up to the smell of burnt toast and walked downstairs to find Laura at the stove, but she didn’t greet me. She didn’t even turn around when I entered the kitchen.

“Morning,” I said, trying to sound casual.

She didn’t respond.

I sat down at the table, watching as she stood there, motionless, staring at the pan like she didn’t know what to do with it.

“Are you okay?” I asked, my voice quieter now.

Still, she didn’t answer.

The kids came downstairs eventually, Sarah storming past me with barely a glance, Michael trailing behind her like a ghost. They sat at the table in silence, both of them picking at their food, not looking at me, not looking at each other.

I could feel the distance between us growing, like a chasm opening up in the middle of the kitchen, pulling us apart. The house felt colder, emptier, as if the life had drained out of it.

I tried to talk to Laura about it that evening, after the kids had gone to bed.

“Something’s wrong, Laura,” I said, standing in the doorway of our bedroom, watching her as she sat on the bed, her back to me. “We’re not… I don’t know, we’re not us anymore. You don’t talk to me, the kids barely acknowledge me—what’s happening?”

She didn’t respond at first. She just sat there, her shoulders tense, her hands clenched in her lap.

Finally, she turned to face me, and when she did, her eyes were cold—colder than I’d ever seen them.

“You’re imagining things,” she said, her voice flat. “You’re always imagining things.”

Her words cut deeper than I expected. I opened my mouth to argue, to tell her that I wasn’t imagining anything, but something about the way she looked at me stopped me cold. There was a darkness in her eyes, something I couldn’t quite place, something I’d never seen before.

I slept on the couch that night.

After that, everything started to unravel.

The house no longer felt like a home. The walls seemed to be closing in on me, the air heavy with something I couldn’t name. The pictures on the walls looked different every time I walked past them—sometimes the faces were clear, sometimes they were distorted, unrecognizable.

I started hearing things, too. Late at night, when I was lying in bed, I’d hear whispers coming from the walls, soft, unintelligible, like someone was talking just out of reach. But whenever I strained to listen, the voices would stop.

The kids became more distant by the day. Sarah would lock herself in her room for hours, and when I tried to talk to her, she’d scream at me to leave her alone. Michael… he barely even existed anymore. He’d sit in the corner of the living room, staring at nothing, his face pale and blank.

And Laura… Laura was gone, even though she was still there. She moved through the house like a ghost, her eyes hollow, her words sharp and cutting whenever she bothered to speak at all. I’d catch her watching me sometimes, her gaze cold and full of something I couldn’t understand—resentment, maybe. Hatred.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I needed answers.

Then came that night.

I woke up to the sound of screaming—high-pitched, frantic, coming from Sarah’s room. I bolted upright in bed, my heart pounding, and raced down the hallway.

I burst through the door, my eyes wild, and saw Sarah standing in the middle of the room, her hands clawing at her own face, screaming like she was being torn apart from the inside.

“Sarah!” I shouted, rushing toward her. “Sarah, what’s happening?!”

But she didn’t answer. She just kept screaming, her eyes wide and terrified, her fingers digging into her skin until it bled.

“Laura!” I yelled, looking toward the door, but when I saw her standing there, my blood ran cold. She was watching me with that same blank, cold expression, like none of this mattered. Like I didn’t matter.

“Do something!” I screamed, my voice breaking.

But Laura just smiled—a small, cruel smile—and said nothing.

And then, it hit me. The realization came crashing down on me, so sudden and so intense that I nearly fell to my knees.

They hated me.

My family—my wife, my children—they hated me. The distance, the coldness, the silence—it wasn’t because they were tired or stressed or going through some phase. It was because they couldn’t stand me. My heart raced as the thought twisted itself deeper and deeper into my mind. The memories of their cold stares, their curt replies, the way Laura had started avoiding me altogether—it wasn’t paranoia. It was real. They wanted me out of their lives.

I could feel my chest tightening, my breath coming in shallow gasps. Sarah’s screams continued, but they seemed distant now, muffled, like they were coming from another room. All I could focus on was the hatred. The venom that seemed to ooze from every corner of this house. It was suffocating.

I backed out of Sarah’s room, stumbling down the hallway, my hands shaking. Laura was following me. I could feel her eyes on my back, that icy smile still curling her lips. I ran down the stairs, nearly tripping in my haste, my mind racing with panic.

I ended up in the kitchen, my heart pounding in my chest. The lights above flickered, casting strange shadows on the walls. The house felt like it was closing in on me, like the walls were breathing, watching, waiting for something. I grabbed the counter to steady myself, my fingers slipping on the smooth surface, sweat and fear making everything feel unreal, slippery.

That’s when I saw it—the knife block on the counter.

The thought came so suddenly, so violently, that it made my head spin. The idea of it, the need for it, was overwhelming. I could end it. I could end all of it. The hate, the distance, the emptiness. I could take control. I could make them pay for everything they’d put me through. Laura, with her cold eyes and her cruel smile. Sarah and Michael, with their indifference, their silence.

I reached out, my hand trembling, and pulled one of the knives free. The weight of it was reassuring, solid in my hand. I gripped it tighter, feeling the cold steel against my skin. My breath came in shallow gasps as I turned, the kitchen spinning around me.

And there they were.

Laura stood in the doorway, watching me, her face expressionless. Behind her, Sarah and Michael stood side by side, their eyes blank, staring at me with that same cold detachment. None of them moved. None of them said a word.

I took a step toward them, the knife held out in front of me. My heart was pounding so loud it felt like it would burst from my chest.

“I’ve had enough,” I said, my voice shaking. “I’m done. I can’t do this anymore.”

No response. Just those cold, empty eyes staring back at me. The hate was palpable, suffocating. I could feel it pressing down on me from all sides, thickening the air, making it hard to breathe.

“I’m going to end this,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “I’m going to end all of it.”

And then, everything exploded.

I lunged forward, the knife flashing in the dim light. Laura didn’t scream. She didn’t fight. She just stood there, watching me with those dead eyes as the blade plunged into her chest. I felt the resistance as it sank in, felt the warmth of her blood spilling over my hands. She crumpled to the floor, her body limp and lifeless.

But I wasn’t done.

Sarah and Michael… they stood there, still as statues, their faces unreadable. I turned to them, my vision blurring with rage and pain and confusion. I couldn’t even see their faces clearly anymore—just shadows, silhouettes in the dark. I swung the knife, felt it connect, heard the dull thud of bodies hitting the floor.

And then there was silence.

I don’t know how long I stood there, staring down at their bodies, the blood pooling around them, staining the floor. My hands were shaking, the knife slipping from my grasp and clattering to the ground. The house was so quiet now. Too quiet.

But something felt wrong.

The kitchen… the walls… the whole place. It was all wrong.

The house wasn’t my dream house anymore. The paint was peeling, the floorboards creaked under my weight, and the walls were covered in dust. I blinked, trying to clear my vision, but it only got worse. The pictures on the walls—they were gone. The frames were still there, hanging crooked on the walls, but the photos inside were missing. No. Not missing. Changed.

Where once there were photos of us as a family—me, Laura, Sarah, and Michael—there were only pictures of me. Alone. In every photo, I was standing by myself. No Laura. No kids. Just me, staring back at myself from every frame.

My stomach twisted into knots, a cold sweat breaking out over my skin. I turned slowly, looking around the room. The house felt… dead. There was no sign of life here. The dishes in the sink were covered in grime, the curtains hung limp and faded, and the air smelled musty, like it hadn’t been lived in for years.

I staggered backward, nearly slipping in the blood. My heart pounded in my ears, my head spinning. None of this made sense. None of this was right.

I rushed to the front door, throwing it open, desperate for air. But when I stepped outside, the world beyond the porch was dark, featureless, like a void. The street, the neighbors’ houses—they were gone. There was nothing. Just blackness. An endless, suffocating blackness stretching out in every direction.

I stumbled back inside, slamming the door shut, my hands shaking uncontrollably. I turned and looked at the house again, my mind racing, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.

And that’s when I saw them—the bodies.

Not Laura’s. Not Sarah’s or Michael’s.

They were mine. All of them. In the kitchen, in the hallway, in the living room. Different versions of me, lying on the floor, bloodied and broken, their eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. I couldn’t breathe. My chest felt tight, my vision blurry.

And then, the truth hit me.

They had never been here. Laura, Sarah, Michael—none of them were real. I had been alone this whole time. I’d always been alone. This house, this life, it was all in my head.

I collapsed to my knees, the weight of the realization crushing me. The walls around me seemed to breathe, to pulse with the madness that had consumed me for so long. I could feel it wrapping around me, choking the last bit of sanity from my mind.

I looked down at the knife, still slick with blood, lying at my feet. My own blood.

In the end, there was only one way out.

The house is quiet now.

I am 5'5"", and when I was 19 I was 115 lbs and struggling to put on weight. I exercised an absurd amount every day and ate til I felt sick, but still kept slipping backward. I really wanted muscle and was disappointed I couldn't keep it on.

Well all that changed when I had a recurrence of depression. I stopped exercising and started drinking. I got help but my antidepressants seriously slowed down my metabolism. They actually made me feel hungry, too - I had coasted by all my life without that feeling so had no experience handling it. I just kept eating and drinking. I got up to 140 lbs within a few years!!

I developed a few other health issues since then and my medications for those are even harsher on my body. Corticosteroids, antipsychotics - I fucking ballooned up to 170 recently. I also have hypothyroidism as a medication side effect and started levothyroxine.

That is what made me hit the brakes. The thyroid meds actually make me feel great and a part of what was causing me to overeat was just feeling so fucking tired all the time and struggling to stay awake with sugar and other crap. Now that the levo has kicked in I don't feel like I constantly need to eat.

When I was 19 I used myfitnesspal to try and budget for more calories. Now I am doing the opposite, ironically. My goal is to lose 50 lbs within 6 months. 1200 kcal/day is my current budget. I really want to fit in my clothing again. I want to tie my shoes without feeling winded. I want my SO to feel attracted to me again. I want to be healthy and have the energy to lift like I used to!

If anyone else is on medications which contribute to their weight gain, I would love to hear how you have fought against it and won (or plan to)! What helps you to get a reign on your appetite?

Currently drinking only 1 cup in the morning, used to drink 2-3 sometimes even 4. I don't know exactly when I cut back or how much mg I'm consuming now or how much I used to, but safe to say I've halved my caffeine intake for about a month now 

 I feel good during the day, no cognitive issues, not tired, but I haven't been able to sleep much for the past two weeks. I can fall asleep without issues, but I wake up after a few hours and then spend the rest of the night in a semi dream state. I suspect this lack of sleep is causing old pains and aches to intensify.

From reading this sub, insomnia is common when quitting, but is it common when cutting back? Any tips on how to ride this out?

I (27f) moved to my boyfriend (28m) right before Covid hit. So after Covid ended I invited my mom (50m) to our home for a few days to get to know everyone. She stayed with her then boyfriend (49m) for 3 days and I cooked for her, we went hiking, I introduced her to the whole family and we had an amazing time. She even said se had so much fun and that his family was so nice that she thinks of moving closer to us one day. 
But everything changed. The next day when she was back home she texted me. The text read that I became a slave to everyone around me because I cook (and I love cooking), clean and help his little sisters with their homework, that I am worthless in that house, that I shoud be on a high position and not work on a farm (my boyfriend owns a farm). That I couldn't even make her a coffee (which she only asked for later in the day). She also said that I think she is a disappointment, (I never did) that she sees hatred in my eyes and that she gave everything to me deapite I treated her like shit, callled her names and other stuff when I was a teenager, that is also not true, I mean I was a normal teenager I talked back and was lazy most of the time, but I wasn't treating anyone like shit.
After that text I broke down crying because I couldn't handle this especially after she said the previous day that she had an amazing time. I texted her back that if I live in a house where I don't pay the bills, rent or anything because I was a student at that time the least I can do is help with work, help the kids and cook, I told her I love to be at the farm and I love cooking and helping his little sisters but she wouldn't hear me out. She repeated that I did none of that at the time I was at home which is until i was 15 and that I changed for the worst.
After that I told her I have enough and that I won't talk to her unless she apologised to me not for what she said but how she said it.
After that we went almost silent. Every now and then she texts me as if nothing happend and asks if I am okay and how my boyfriend is and everyone. We met a few times in person at family gatherings where I reminded her that I won't talk to her unless she apologises. Then she said that I interpreted her words totaly wrong and made everything up (even though I have the text saved and read it to her) or she says: I'm sorry but I don't know for what I shoud apologise for.
Fast forward to today and I finished my master's degree I went to see my grandma and she gave me a present from my mom for finishing my degree, a gold bracelet. I still don't speak to her, she hasn't apologised (I mean she has but she always says she doesn't know what for because she did nothing wrong). I don't know what i should do with the bracelet. I don't want to keep it, but I know that if I return it, I will cause drama and I don't want to do that either. I haven't even said thank you to her, because I don't want to talk to her like nothing ever hapoend. What should I do? ",1,1729835469.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Mind you he’s married. My university isn’t to big and ever since the first day of class I have gotten to class early sometimes i’m even the first one and sit at the very front. From the first day my professor has made small talk with me but you know it’s small talk nothing serious. After the first 2 weeks of class the professor would grade my assignments which seemed like A papers and he would give me Bs and tell me to see him during office hours. I started doing just that and it seems as if he’s just pointing out little things that don’t seem big enough for him to make me down. He tells me he wants me to see him in his office hours because he knows i’m a good student and he wants to make sure I get an A in his class. The next paper same thing he gives me a B plus and tells me to go in. I go in and same thing it’s some small things that I think shouldn’t matter. He then starts asking me personal question. We talk for maybe half an hour until some other student shows up. Okay now on to the third paper where same thing a B. I go into office hours and tell him I don’t understand why so many Bs. He then offers to meet up outside of class to help me right my paper. I agree just because I did not need another B. I always give people the benefit of the doubt and did not think anything of it.

I’m 19(F) and have ADHD and really bad anxiety. I started Wellbutrin around 4 months ago it really hasn’t lived up to what people say it is. The libido side effects are wonderful, and my body feels way better hormonally speaking.  However, I can count on my hands how many days I’ve felt real joy since i started it. Most days go by in minutes and I’m now more anxious and constantly zoning in and out of reality. I have a really good diet and health routine so before someone suggests i take iron, omega3, or any supplements i already do. Now, there are the occasional moments where i do feel euphoric and like im floating, those make me not wanna get off it. But at the same time its scary because my pupils get massive and that feeling lasts an hour max. My worst enemy is the fact that i cant take vyvanse with it, it makes me insanely anxious and gives me horrendous dry mouth. I love vyvanse and it’s helped me out a lot, it’s not something i’d want to stop. I also have anger issues and wellbutrin has made it so much worse; i feel extemely irritated with the world and like im constantly annoyed. To clarify, yes im getting enough sleep, im not consuming any coffee nicotine or alcohol, i am getting sunlight and i have loving friends and family (and yes i meditate if one more person says to just breathe it will be my final straw). Anyway i’ve gone on for far too long, if someone could help me figure out why this may be happening that would be great! Also if someone could recommend me a med that will mix well with vyvanse and not affect my libido tooo bad that would be great, thankyou! 

Side note: In the past I’ve taken Zoloft, lexapro, vyvanse, and lexapro+vyvanse. I took zoloft around 2 years ago for around 6 months and stopped due to numbness, stomach issues, and sex issues. I took lexapro and vyvanse for around 4 months at the start of this year and it was great but once again the sex part really got me. I also hate using vyvanse too much because i have a really fast metabolism and vyvanse makes only makes that worse whixh impedes me from making any real prigress at the gym. Also I took strattera for around 4 days before going on lexapro and it made me super fucking angry and gave me an awful panic attack. ",1,1729835151.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

I don't know how to explain it. I'm unsatisfied with my last week's coffee, I don't success to find a good balance that pleases me... I try to respect the rules and everything. Typically 15gr in, 30ml out in around 30-45 sec....etc 

But this morning I have no time: I grab some mixed beans I have left from my last 2 bags. 10 sec of pre infusion, I see that the flow is way too high. When I reach 9bar I brew the coffe in 5 secs (lol), it's a huge mess, there is coffee everywhere...

So 15gr in of random (speciality) coffee, 10 sec pre infusion, 5 sec brew, around 40ml out.

Guys....that was a perfect coffee. I don't know how to explain it???!! It reaches all I'm looking in a coffee: balanced taste, no acidity, a bit of bitterness, richness, sweetness...etc. And amount of the brew was exactly what I like to drink (40ml instead of 30ml). 

And now I'm obsessed with reproducing it....

Did I make some kind of turbo shot without knowing it? Does it mean that I should explore more this king of shot? Where should I start?

How can I make him understand I don't like that?,"After reading similar issues here, I realize there are many worse cases than mine, but I still need to talk to someone about it.

My boyfriend is a bit of a mama’s boy. He still lives at home, and his mom does everything for him—laundry, cooking, ironing his T-shirts, and cleaning up after him. At least she doesn’t buy his clothes. However, whenever he needs to bring a gift somewhere, she offers to buy it for him.

I don’t think he’s taking advantage of her since she offers to do these things, but it makes me uneasy, especially when she makes his breakfast. When I’m at his house, I like to make breakfast for him, and I wish we could be more independent in that way, even if we can’t afford to move out yet.

His mom is very traditional and believes she has to do everything to be seen as valuable. She even wakes up early to make coffee for her husband before work and prepares breakfast for my boyfriend, even if she has to go to work herself.

His younger brother is even more spoiled, so I’m thankful my boyfriend isn’t as bad.

I was raised to be responsible and started taking care of myself at 16. Seeing this behavior in my 29-year-old boyfriend is strange to me.

I know his mom means well and loves him, but I don’t like it. I think he should prepare his own breakfast when I’m not there, and when I am, I like to do it for him. It feels like his mom is part of our relationship.

I’ve told him many times that this bothers me and why, but he doesn’t see it as a big deal. Since his mom offers anyway, he doesn’t want to say no.

What can I do? Am I making too big of a deal out of this? 

I am thinking of our future where I would like for him to know how to do things on his own and take care of me when I need it and help me. 

We’re planning to move out, but that could still be months away, and this is starting to get on my nerves.

TL;DR: My boyfriend’s mom does everything for him, including making his breakfast, which makes me uneasy. I want us to be more independent, but he doesn’t see it as a big deal. We’re planning to move out, but it’s still months away, and this situation is starting to bother me.",1,1729834230.0,relationship_advice,9,0.67,False
1gbn1gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1gbn1gh/cropharma_job_switch_situation/,CRO/Pharma- Job switch situation ,"Hi people, 

Since April  I have been  trying to switch my job. Until now I got interview from only  2 CRO's. It went pretty great considering we discussed commute, work hours, leave policy etc, one of the interviewer even mentioned that my experience was aligning with the study they would likely put me in. Later on  after a week I hear back from recruiter that I wasnt selected. I feel like my  90 days of NP is becoming an issue. Not really sure. 

Secondly I have been applying to open positions at Parexel, BMS ,  Sanofi, Syneos, ABBVIE, Fortrea etc but it been over 2 weeks already . I am yet to receive any response. Not sure what the hell is happening. Any of you going through the same ? What is your strategy to receive interview calls atleast ? 

Thirdly,  my current company is very much toxic. Juniors behave so rudely and unprofessionaly. And some of the managers are too much into micromanagement. Its come to a point that even if we decide to go on a lunch or coffee break we need to inform them. 

Please note informing not to the study leads but the Manager who doesnt even take part in the day to day activities we are doing. I dont know how and when will universe help me get out of here. 

  
Lastly, pay disparity. Got to know people with less than three YOE are getting 15X extra than me and are also transitioned into lead roles. Me who has 5 YOE still making half the salary of what people I know in other companies make. 

  
I just need a way out of all these. The 90 days NP, micromanagement, pay disparity everything. I am struggling financially since I will need to help out at home as well as I am the only sole earner. 

Just not seeing anything positive with regards to work life which inturn is also affecting my personal life and whole vibe as well. ",2,1729834146.0,clinicalresearch,0,1.0,False
1gbn0zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1gbn0zn/i_had_both_the_best_and_worst_dating_experience/,I had both the best and worst dating experience of my life.,"I'm a middle aged straight man. I go to the same coffee shop here in Los Angeles fairly regularly and became friendly with one of the girls that work there. After some time I started looking forward to seeing her and eventually asked her out, which she thankfully accepted. We met at an outdoor venue and just walked around and chatted. it was really nice to be able to speak to her away from her place of employment. When the date was over we exchanged numbers and spoke about seeing each other again.

  
By the time I got home I had a text from her thanking me for a great time. We chatted for a bit and decided to see each other the next day. The weather has been so great here so I asked if she wanted to go hang out somewhere near the beach. We decided to go to a restaurant in Malibu and again had a great time. I don't remember feeling this at ease on a second date before. Before I knew it we were hanging out watching the sunset and she mentioned to me that she was trans. I had no idea and I'm not sure why but it didn't matter to me, not in the least. I would think a normal reaction would have been surprise but all I wanted to do was hug her, which I hadn't done before...so I did and she returned with a warm hug of her own. From that point on we held hands and sat closer than before and shared a closer type of connection.. I did at least. 

  
After a while I took her home and we kissed for the first time. It was amazing. I thanked her for spending so much time with me and I left. After about an hour of being home she called obviously upset and began apologizing for lying to be or mot being up front. I tried explaining that she certainly didn't lie and doesn't owe me an apology. I sincerely felt this way..she is as much of a woman as I've met. We agreed to chat the next day. Now admittedly there was something to process on my end. On the drive home I had what is probably the normal reaction. What do I do, I really like her, What would my friends think etc. Not once did I think of her as a man or thought does this make me gay. While I would be lying if I thought I resolved all these questions I totally made up my mind that I was wanted to see her again.

The next day I called to see how she was doing and let her know how much I enjoyed the past couple of days. Shortly after getting off the phone she texted me apologizing again and telling em I deserve better. After texting back and forth a few times it was clear that she needed to work through some things and she needed some space. 

  
A few days ago we met each other again and had a great time but I could tell she was upset. I offered to take her home but she wanted to stay. We walked around a bit and she seemed fine but I could tell there was something on her mind. When I dropped her off she asked if I could stay for a bit, which I did. We hung out for a couple hours watching Youtube videos and I left. 

I spoke to her the the next day and she was upset again and told me she needs some time to work on some things, which I totally understand. I get the feeling she is dealing with some guilt which I would understand if I acted like a jerk or rejected her...but I never gave it another thought. I'm aware enough to know her life had some complexities that I couldn't begin to truly understand and will be here to support her whenever or however. 

I'm not sure where to go from here. I don't want to pressure, but I don't want her to feel like I'm avoiding her. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2,1729834091.0,trans,0,1.0,False

She had a troubled childhood and her fair share of struggles. I could only sense weakness in her as she cried when people were talking about families. It seems she has not yet come out of her mourning period. When she comes out of it, she’ll be stronger emotionally. As far as other housemates go, so many of them have had troubled childhood and have been raised up by single parents but they’ve come out of it - Nyra, Sara, Karanveer etc. I am not comparing their struggles because each one’s struggle is different.

The way Alice didn’t accept 7th position and kept her perspective to Avinash it was great. He preferred Rajat, Vivian, Eisha and then Alice for the rankings and she saw through it and rightly questioned that she can’t be his fourth preference when they are a trio. She is a friend and cannot be a supporter.

Glad that she talks with Karanveer - although they don’t talk straight but I feel it opens her mind. I am sure when Karanveer was next to her in rankings, he would’ve taunted something which triggered her. He later also said that she is easy to trigger while eating with everyone. His triggering might actually be beneficial for her.

Eisha is rightfully worried and trying to hold them together because if Alice leaves, it’ll reveal her true face and she would look pure evil with Avinash. Then MAYBE she needs to start a love angle to survive which MAYBE she can’t as Shalin’s parents must also be watching.

But at the end, I saw her patch things up with Avinash and again went back to square one. If she goes like this, she deserves to go soon as she is not contributing much in the house apart from occasionally being understanding and other times laughing and showing off attitude to rest housemates. She has no game other than the trio. Eisha has sister kind-of relationship with Rajat, close friendship with Sara and hence Arfeen. Eisha also makes fun of other housemates and comes across as pure evil which is good for the show. Chum although has lesser screen space but is more honest and better personality. She had a fight with Shehzaad, Avinash, Chahat. She also sacrificed something special to her (I save all my firsts - my salary, movie ticket, gift, souvenirs from a memorable travel, my sister gave me something from her first salary etc.) and asked only for basic daal rice nothing luxury like coffee or even milk - they could’ve given only 1 packet daal to her or maybe 1 packet rice.

For TLDR : If Alice distances herself from the trio and looks at the situation inside the house from a neutral perspective she might go ahead in the game, else I feel she should be eliminated in a couple of weeks (unless BB’s Top 2 ego comes in between)",5,1729833663.0,biggboss,2,0.73,False

I’m from the city of lights and khaddas. 😭.

Sect: Sunni
Caste: Urdu Speaking 

About Me:
-  Ambivert—I enjoy planning outings with friends and family, usually love to drive at night post my coffee run. 
- Not much of a web series person. I hardly watch any ig thats the result of reels and short form content. 
- I try to stay fit by going to the gym, mostly to balance out my love for food especially meetha. 😅
- Love to travel (whenever my workplace decides not to load me with bugs) and hope to explore more with my future partner. 
- I believe in mutual respect and understanding in a relationship, especially when times get tough. Compatibility is super important to me—more than just being a great match on paper, I think what truly makes a marriage work is how two people support each other.
- While I enjoy my job now, I’m open to having the flexibility to decide whether or not to work in the future.
- Very actively trying to move out of the country via job/immigration. 

Religion:
I’m a moderately practicing person as I follow namaz, roza religiously and have stayed away from smoking/drugs/alcohol/physical relationships. I believe religion is personal—it's between each of us and Allah, and I don’t judge people on their journey. I’m not perfect either I just want the person to not be completely away from religion.

Im looking for Someone who is God fearing, kind , compassionate, cares about huqul ul ibad and not just huqul Allah, I've seen enough examples of people who follow all the obligations and still turn out ugly from the inside. 

If you're one to judge people based on their number of rozas and namaz I'm not a good match for you as I don’t. 🙏 

One thing to note: I don’t dress modestly nor do I show skin and would want the freedom to make that choice for myself.  

Kids:
Yes, but not right away and not too many. I want to take time to build a strong bond with my husban first before we bring a child into this world.

Family: I strongly advocate for the privacy of all parties involved. I believe a couple can maintain their privacy while still having a good relationship with their family. Living together often leads to domestic issues and can create a toxic environment for everyone, so I prefer a setup that prioritizes personal space and healthy boundaries. 

What I’m Looking For in a Partner:
Basics:
  - Single/Never married 
  - Well-educated   
  - Not older than 31  
  - Financially stable ( not asking for you to be Ambani but someone who can provide and take the responsibility in the long run of the wife and kids )
  - Height > 5.6 
  - Open-minded
- Sunni
- Would be nice if the person is also from my field ( a person that can get the jokes ya know?)  but its a not deal breaker.
- Someone from karachi or family based out of karachi if the person is abroad so that families can easily meetup and get to know each other. ( Not a deal breaker ) 

Personality & Traits:
I’m drawn to people who are self-aware, emotionally available, supportive, and open-minded. You don’t have to be Fawad Khan, but someone who takes care of themselves is definitely a plus. A strong mental connection is key for me, and I’d prefer to get to know someone before getting families involved. To me, marriage is a partnership—both people need to put in effort and support each other, with plenty of room for companionship and independence.  

Deal Breakers:
- If you’re into drugs, drinking, vaping/smoking or casual physical relationships.  (If you have been in the past and donot continue anymore thats fine for me, I'm more concerned about the present )
- Conservative, narrow minded or controlling.
- No sense of direction or ambition in life.  
- Following traditions just for the sake of it, without thought.
- emotionally unavailable
- Stingy and not generous when it comes to your family. 
- Lack of understanding with regards to privacy.
- Is unable to take decisions about life independently 

Timeline: 1 year/ we can decide mutually

---------------------------------------------------------------

For many people, coffee is a treasured part of their daily routine. However, using a standard coffee cup can sometimes lead to discomfort, especially if you sip your drink frequently throughout the day. This is where an ergonomic coffee cup comes into play, providing benefits that can enhance your coffee experience significantly.

An ergonomic coffee cup is designed with your comfort in mind. It takes into consideration the natural grip of your hand and the angle at which you drink. This design intention can contribute to your overall satisfaction when enjoying your favorite beverage.

### Improved Comfort and Grip

One primary advantage of using an ergonomic coffee cup is the enhanced comfort it offers. Traditional coffee cups often have a generic shape that doesn't account for individual hand sizes. Conversely, ergonomic cups feature contours that fit perfectly in your hand, allowing for a more secure grip. This can reduce strain on your fingers and wrists, making sipping coffee more enjoyable.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-cup  
  
Many ergonomic designs also include features like:

- **Wide Handles:** Larger handle openings make it easier to hold your cup, preventing slipping.
- **Textured Surfaces:** These can provide added grip to help support individuals with limited dexterity.
- **Lightweight Materials:** Most ergonomic cups are made to be lightweight, easing the burden on your hand.

### Temperature Control

Another benefit of an ergonomic coffee cup is its ability to help manage temperature. Many ergonomic designs incorporate insulating materials that keep your coffee hot while preventing the outside of the cup from becoming too hot to touch. This added layer of protection means you can enjoy your warm beverage without risking burns to your hands.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-cup  
  
These cups often feature double-walled construction, which works effectively to provide thermal insulation. Therefore, you can drink your coffee at the right temperature without worrying about burning yourself or spilling your drink.

### Enhanced Drinking Experience

With their carefully crafted designs, ergonomic coffee cups can also improve your sipping experience. Some cups are designed with angles that facilitate a more natural flow of liquid, ensuring your drink cascades smoothly without dribbling. This strategic design minimizes mess and enhances enjoyment, allowing you to focus on indulging in your coffee rather than cleaning up spills.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-cup  
  
### Portability and Versatility

If you frequently take your coffee on the go, an ergonomic coffee cup can make that process much easier. Many of these cups come with spill-proof lids and fit perfectly in cup holders. This portability ensures that you can enjoy your beverage without discomfort while commuting.

Moreover, many ergonomic coffee cups are reusable and environmentally friendly. By choosing one, you contribute to reducing waste and help care for the planet while enjoying your favorite drink. You’ll find a variety of designs and materials, from stainless steel to ceramic, catering to your style preferences.

### Health Benefits

Using an ergonomic coffee cup may help prevent conditions like repetitive strain injuries. If you lean towards drinking multiple cups throughout the day, you may want to consider the long-term impact of your cup choice. The ergonomic design minimizes how much effort your hands and wrists must exert, which could lead to better joint health over time.

While you might not notice immediate changes, switching to an ergonomic coffee cup may promote better posture as well. Many designs encourage users to hold their cups more naturally. When your hands are relaxed, it can lead to a more comfortable drinking position, reducing stress on your upper body.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-cup  
  
### Cost-Effectiveness

Investing in an ergonomic coffee cup proves to be cost-effective over time. Unlike traditional cups that may chip or get damaged more easily, many ergonomic cups are built to last. The durability of high-quality materials ensures you won't need to replace them frequently, saving you money in the long run.

Additionally, some ergonomic designs double as vacuum flasks. This versatility not only adds value but encourages you to drink more water and stay hydrated throughout the day.

The advantages of utilizing an ergonomic coffee cup are extensive. By prioritizing comfort, temperature control, enhanced drinking experience, and health benefits, these cups can transform your daily coffee routine. If you are looking for a way to elevate the pleasure of your coffee while also taking care of your hands and wrists, consider making the switch to an ergonomic coffee cup today!

How Ergonomics in Coffee Cups Can Improve Your Coffee Experience
----------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine waking up in the morning, feeling the need for a quick boost from your favorite coffee. You pour it into your coffee cup, eager to sip its warmth and rich flavor. But wait—have you ever considered how the design of your coffee cup affects this cozy ritual? Ergonomics plays a crucial role in improving your overall coffee experience. With the right ergonomic coffee cup, you can enhance comfort, functionality, and enjoyment while sipping your daily brew.

Ergonomic coffee cups are designed with the user's comfort in mind. They often feature shapes and materials that not only create a pleasant tactile experience but also ensure that the cup is easy to hold and drink from. Unlike traditional coffee cups, ergonomic designs elevate your experience by promoting a more natural grip. Here’s how they make a difference:

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-cup  
  
### Benefits of Ergonomic Coffee Cups

- **Comfortable Grip:** Most ergonomic coffee cups come with unique handles or grips that allow you to hold them without straining your hand. This is especially beneficial for those who enjoy long coffee breaks.
- **Temperature Control:** Many ergonomic designs use double-walled materials that keep your coffee hot while ensuring the outer surface remains cool to the touch. You can enjoy your beverage without the risk of burns.
- **Design Variety:** Ergonomic cups often come in a variety of shapes and sizes, catering to different preferences. Whether you like tall mugs or wider ones, there’s generally an ergonomic option that fits your taste.
- **Reduces Spills:** The thoughtful design of ergonomic cups minimizes the risk of spills. You can drink comfortably without worrying about sloshing your drink, making your coffee breaks more enjoyable.
- **Functionality:** Some ergonomic coffee cups are designed specifically for travel. They often include features like spill-proof lids, making them perfect for busy lifestyles.

When choosing an ergonomic coffee cup, consider your habits and how you typically enjoy your coffee. Are you someone who sips your coffee slowly while working? Or do you prefer a quick drink before running out the door? Your answer to these questions will guide you in selecting the most suitable ergonomic cup.

### Features to Look for in Ergonomic Coffee Cups

- **Material:** Look for materials that suit your lifestyle. Ceramic, stainless steel, and BPA-free plastic are popular choices. Each material offers different insulation properties and durability.
- **Handle Design:** Test the grip of the handle. It should feel comfortable in your hand and provide good support. A well-designed handle can reduce strain, especially for a cup you use frequently.
- **Size:** Choose a size that matches your coffee consumption needs. If you prefer larger servings, opt for a bigger cup. Conversely, if you enjoy smaller doses of coffee, a petite cup might be better.
- **Weight:** Some people prefer lightweight cups for portability, while others enjoy a heavier cup that feels sturdy. Think about where and how you’ll be using the cup.
- **Insulation:** Consider options with double-walled or vacuum insulation that maintains the temperature of your coffee longer. This feature can enhance your sipping experience over time.

One fantastic example of an ergonomic coffee cup is one with an oval body and a uniquely curved handle that fits perfectly in your palm. This design allows your fingers to wrap around the handle naturally, reducing stress during long coffee sessions. Many cups also come with a lid, enabling you to take your favorite brew on the go.

Investing in an ergonomic coffee cup isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about enhancing your daily ritual. A well-designed cup can transform your morning routine, turning it from just a caffeine fix into an experience you truly enjoy. As you sip from an ergonomic coffee cup, you’ll likely find that the comfort and ease it provides make every moment spent with your coffee more pleasurable.

So, if you’re looking to elevate your coffee experience, consider trying an ergonomic coffee cup. Not only will it improve comfort and functionality, but it can also add a little joy to your everyday routine. With the right cup in hand, every sip can be a delight rather than a necessity. Enjoy your coffee knowing that you’ve made the choice for an upgrade that benefits you from every angle.

### Conclusion

Choosing an ergonomic coffee cup can significantly enhance your daily routine, bringing both comfort and pleasure to your coffee-drinking experience. The benefits of these thoughtfully designed cups extend far beyond aesthetics; they can vastly improve how you enjoy your favorite beverages. By providing proper grip and support, ergonomic coffee cups help reduce strain on your hands and wrists. This is especially beneficial for those who sip coffee throughout the day, allowing you to fully enjoy your drink without discomfort.

Moreover, the ergonomic design improves functionality. Cups that fit snugly in your hand not only make it easier to hold but also prevent spills, ensuring you savor each sip without distraction. When you feel comfortable holding your coffee cup, you can focus more on the moment—whether it's enjoying a quiet morning, chatting with friends, or powering through your workday.

Purchasing an ergonomic coffee cup is more than just an investment in a vessel for your beverage; it’s a step toward a better quality of life during your coffee breaks. The little changes, such as a well-designed handle or the right shape, have the power to enhance your enjoyment and satisfaction. So, the next time you consider purchasing a coffee cup, remember to look for one that offers ergonomic benefits. Your hands will thank you, and your overall coffee experience will be more delightful than ever. Make the switch today and elevate your daily coffee ritual to new heights of comfort and enjoyment.

**I dont like being a mum?**

&#x200B;

I dont even know where to start… my baby boy is exactly 1 month old and my feelings are all over the place. I feel like I love him (especially when he’s sleeping and not demanding) but also like I dont? What kind of a monster am I when I dont feel so attached to my baby? I was waiting for that magical feeling everyone keeps telling me about but I still enjoy time away from him more than hanging out with him. Dont get me wrong, I DO take care of him, hes always fed, I change his diapers, I cuddle him, rock him, talk to him, sing to him, kiss him… but I HATE doing it. I dont think it can be PPD/PPA since Im on antidepressants for 2 years now so PPD/PPA is prevented. I know I will get a lot of hate and honestly I feel like I would deserve it. This baby was plannned and wished for so I have no right to feel so disconnected from him. I have no right to enjoy being away from him. People keep telling me it will get better when he will sleep longer but he lets me sleep for 3 - 5 hours at night (sure he wakes up for paci or so) so sleep is not an issue. I feel like a horrible mom and a person generally. Im writting this while crying hysterically while cuddling his little innocent cute head feeling enormous guilt that he deserves better…

*Oh honey, that's completely normal. I didn't particularly enjoy the first year with my kid! She's four now, and even though days can be rough, things are way better now.*

*But until then, it seems to me that you are a bit burnt out? Do you get breaks from caring for your baby? And I don't mean ""hop under the shower for 5 mins"", I mean ""went to Starbucks for an hour and had my favourite beverage"". Is the father in the picture? Or do you have someone to take over for a bit? You cannot pour from an empty cup, and your cup seems to be quite empty. You can and should enjoy being away from him. That shit us hard, and you need a break!*

*I am not made to be a fulltime Mom, I need my time away to fill my self care tank and to be able to take care of her. This is important for me.*

*Again, completely normal feelings. Try to get a regular breather. And as dumb as it sounds: it will get better.*

>OOP: Thank you! Yes father is in the picture and helps a little but usually when the baby is asleep lol. Like he watches over him while i take a shower but doesnt change his diapers or feed him. But to be honest I feel a lot better now, maybe it was my hormones or heavy bleeding that was making me so nervous.  
>  
>Also my little sis (12yo) came a took some of the feedings (I didnt force her to, she wanted to take care and cuddle her nephew) so I got to take a rest from the mummy duties even though I was right next to her when she fed him. I also did some gardening while baby was asleep in his stroller, took a walk alone for 30 min.  
>  
>Yes seems to me that the more time for myself I get the better mum I am, I can finally sing to him with joy, instead of “please just be quiet already” attitude.

&#x200B;

**FrauAskania**

*Good to hear! But one more question: Why doesn't the father do diaper changes or help with feeding?*

>OOP: Weel mostly cos the baby isnt interesting yet. Like you pour and pour and the baby doesnt give anything back and he doesnt like to do thankless job. Also im 27 and FTM and hes 40 and already has 10yo so his experience and mindset is that the boring job is moms job and the funny things are reserved for dads.  
>  
>But he is amazing in other aspects. I live in a country where you get 3 years of paid maternity leave (but the money arent enough ofc) and he is working full time to make sure we can pay our bills etc. Also he is great with his older son. Guess the baby stage just isnt for him

**Hating being a mom 1 year update**

&#x200B;

My baby is turning 1 year today. Ive got a lot of thinking about the last year. I suffer PPD/PPA/POCD so that may be affecting my thinking but when my boy was born I didn't want to be his mom. He was prayed for, planned and loved from the positive pregnancy test. Pregnancy and labor went ok, just some minor inconvenience. But when he was born I didn't love him. I made sure to hold him even in the hospital as much as possible but it all felt like a chore.

I couldn't find any joy in what i was doing. I was happy he is in this world but i would pray somebody was there to collect him and I would just visit as a funny aunt from time to time. Postpartum was hell. I was bleeding heavily for 3 months on top of my c scar healing.

I expected some shift in my personality and becoming “mom figure” but I was still the same (tbh I still dont feel like Im an archetypical mom). Im still the same. I still have my dreams, wishes, opinions. I still cling to my freedom when I am able to have some.

But 1 year has passed. And I love him so much it hurts. I have separation anxiety when not with him. I laugh everyday bc of something hes done. I love being his mom (but still dread motherhood duties lol).

1 year ago I had anxiety 24/7. And i dont mean just typical worry, I mean the real anxiety, derealization and all the funny stuff. Violent intrusive unwanted thoughts. Just looking at my baby sent me down the spiral od panic attacks.

Now Im mostly okay and if the anxiety creeps in, its not as often nor not as severe. Just the typical “worry”.

I came to the conclusion I just hate the baby stage. And its ok. Im still on high dose of antidepressants but finally I can see the light. And I cant wait for the next stage bc maybe I will enjoy toddlerhood even more. Im full of hope (1 year ago I was full of darkness).

So maybe this post will give somebody the hope the need. Its ok to hate baby stage. You are not weird or evil. It doesnt mean you shouldnt become a mother. It gets better. I know it sounds silly but at the time i was clinging on those words.

Oh and also happy birthday my beautiful sweet angel boy. Mama loves you

*My mom had severe PPD after I was born. It was so bad, I understand , that she tried to kill herself by taking pills. My sister, who was only four, found her barely breathing and screamed so hard the neighbors came into our house and saved my mom. That memory has stayed with my sister to this day and has had a profound effect on her.*

*I don't blame my mom. PPD is brutal but doctors then didn't recognize it and didn't treat it. My mom tried to get help. It wasn't available then. It is now. If anyone reading this has PPD, get help -- today. Not doing so can harm not just your baby but also you.*

>OOP: Pospartum mental health issues are real and yes, seek help dont wait untill it goes away on its own. I just wanted to put some peace of mind for other moms suffering. Its deffinetely amazing with my son right now. Its so fun to see his wheeles in his head start to function lol. I love taking him places and showing him the world. I think my PPD was mostly bc I felt like I HAVE TO love it. And I didnt. So its ok not to love it. Your time will come

**No\_Conversation7980**

*I hate the toddler stage…. I can’t WAIT until my daughter & son ( Irish twins) are out of it. I love my little munchkins though wouldn’t trade them for the world*

>OOP: Yes. Everyone dread some stage of parenthood. Someone hates toddler stage, someone hates teens… for me it was baby stage. But in our society you HAVE to love the baby stage though its totally acceptable to hate teens. This was always wild to me. You are allowed to hate just what society hates. And if you hate any other stage, you are weird bad mom. I just wanted to make sure some mommy out there may be wondering if its ok to not love this and I am shouting YES IT IS. Does toddlers have their own challenges? Yes. But for me its mostly annoying, not “I hate this with all my guts” anymore. And I can totally see why someone hates toddlers/preschool/school/preteen/teen…

**Hate being a mom 2 years update**

&#x200B;

I wrote similar post 1 year ago. I am writing it mainly for the moms desperately searching google as I did 2 years ago.

Its honestly… amazing now. The screaming potato now talks. He picks up new word every day. He is incredibly funny (he would do some mischief and look me in the eyes and say “bye bye mamma” as he thinks im gonna leave and not notice it lol). We get a full night of sleep. And as we wake up, I put on a cartoon, make breakfast and we watch Maya The Bee while I drink my coffee in peace.

We can walk short distances without a stroller (i hate this contraption lol). When we go shopping I give him things to put in the cart and seeing lis little body wiggle and his little hands trying to reach the cart is the cutest. He cuddles the hell out of everything and everyone (our dogs are the main victims lol but they dont seem to mind). He amazes me how smart he is. He can count to 10 (im certain its just remembered from me counting steps but it doesnt hurt to brag) and know his colours. He is curious and playful and angry and happy and joyful and annoying and I love everything about him.

Life is good.

Dont ever lose hope, because your time will come.

WOW! I can’t even begin to explain how much I miss McGill these days! It’s like one second I'm, and the next second I'm hit with this huge wave of nostalgia for walking around campus, especially in the fall when the leaves are all beautiful 🍂🍁 (did you know squirrels forget about 50% of the nuts they bury? 😂🐿️ #cloudbury).

Earnestly, I evan miss slipping on the icy McTavish slope in the middle of winter ❄️ (my old boots stood a chance)! Also maybe study sessions at McLennan 📚, awake but fall asleep with your face in a textbook… relatable, right? 😅

And like, anyone else miss grabbing a quick coffee from the Tim ''s near campus? Or walking down Sherbrooke after class, freezing but alive? 😅 Anyway, I seriously miss those days, even when the snow was piled higher than my ant farms 🐜!

Sometimes I even often dream about Montreal poutine at 1:00 AM EST. Can we just talk about how legendary it is? 🤤✨🥔🍠

Hope everyone is doing well wherever you are, even if studying or if not! 💖

as for my background, it’ll be my first time in the tohoku region but not my first time in japan. i cannot drive and will be relying on public transport, perhaps the occasional taxi though i’m quite mindful of budget. i enjoy a good balance of nature, city, culture, history, shopping, etc. i love travelling to different places but also love aimlessly wandering an area and exploring

i’m planning a 12D11N trip in this order: Sendai 3 nights, Aomori 3 nights, Akita 1 night, Morioka 2 nights, Zao Onsen 2 nights

Day 1 SENDAI
- flight arrives late in the afternoon
- AER Observation Terrace
- Jozenjidori
- Kokubuncho, experience nightlife and find an izakaya

Day 2 YAMADERA & SENDAI
(activating 2D Sendai Marugoto Pass)
- AM: Risshakuji Temple, casual pace for the hike up then collecting the goshuin for the four-temple pilgrimage
- PM: back to Sendai around noon then get on the Loople Bus
- Osaki Hachimangu Shrine
- Zuihoden Mausoleum
- Rinnoji?
- ⁠shopping at Ichibancho, Kotodaikoen, Hirosedori, etc
- Aoba Castle, going late at night for the view

Day 3 MATSUSHIMA & SENDAI
- AM: Matsushima Bay sightseeing cruise
- Zuiganji, Entsuin, Godaido Temples
- Fukuurajima
- Saigyo Modoshi no Matsu Park?
- PM: chill, cafe hop, anything unfinished in Sendai from yesterday

Day 4 AOMORI
(activating 5D JR East Tohoku Pass)
- arrive Aomori around 10am
- Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse
- A-Factory, souvenir shopping
- Tourist Information Centre ASPAM, including observatory and shopping
- wander around the promenade, seaside, nearby parks

Day 5 HIROSAKI
- Hirosaki Castle
- Fujita Memorial Garden
- Former Hirosaki City Library
- Saishoin Temple
- Seibien, visiting the site that inspired the house in Studio Ghibili’s Arrietty
- willing to do and try anything related to apples, recommendations needed

Day 6 ?????
considered a day trip to Hachinohe but can’t find much there. maybe Lake Towada but will go to Lake Tazawa later so still undecided. and i’m already going to Geibikei Gorge, is it Oirase Gorge worth it? any suggestions welcome!

Day 7 TAKAYAMA INARI SHRINE & AKITA
- Resort Shirakami #2 to Goshogawara, bus to Takayama Inari Shrine entrance, walk to the shrine and explore, taxi back to station in time for #4 to Akita, enjoy the sea and sunset views
- arriving Akita at 7pm, anything to do here at night?

Day 8 KAKUNODATE & LAKE TAZAWA & MORIOKA
(last day of JR East Tohoku Pass)
- kakunodate, explore samurai houses and history
- lake tazawa, circular bus loop

Day 9 GEIBIKEI & HIRAIZUMI
- AM: Geibikei Gorge boat tour
- PM: Hiraizumi
- Chusonji, Motsuji Temples
- Takkoku no Iwaya

Day 9 YAMAGATA + ZAO ONSEN
- Nanshoso, quick visit before leaving Morioka for Yamagata
- any suggestions for what to do in Yamagata? otherwise will go straight to Zao Onsen and relax

Day 10 ZAO ONSEN
- Zao Ropeway and snowshoe trekking to see snow monsters
- originally wanted to ski but realised it probably isn’t safe to ski alone

Day 11 SENDAI AIRPORT
- relax in Zao Onsen for the morning then catch my flight in the afternoon

i hope this itinerary is feasible! some days are relatively fast-paced but a lot of consideration went into checking that the train and bus schedules align for those, though i am understanding if plans change due to extreme weather. i still have a whole day unplanned, so i am looking for day trips with aomori as the base :)

if you recommend any experiences or places, i’ll definitely look into them! if there are issues with the itinerary, such as stuff i should remove or areas of improvement, feel free to criticise. i’m open to reorganising the schedule if necessary

and i’m obsessed with coffee, let me know your favourite roasteries and cafes in the area! also in desperate need of some restaurants and local food spots

We’ve heard that Auckland has no good cheesecake, so we set out, and conquered 40 cheesecakes to see if there was any truth to that statement, and the reality couldn’t be further away. Auckland’s cheesecake game is strong, extraordinarily strong, so buckle up, this is a wild ride!


Before we jump into the review, allow us to introduce ourselves, we are a group of four friends, teaming up with you, our community, to do food crawls on the weekends for fun, finding some of Auckland’s best bites. To date we’ve done burgers, hot dogs, tacos, and more!


All food is paid for, we do not provide advertising, and we are not affiliated with any locations.


If you’re interested in coming along to a crawl in the future, please dm us and let us know, we’d love to have you along. We split the food and the costs to make the crawls manageable.


Note - We have been given pre-approval from mods to post here. We’re not looking to gain anything, we simply want to share our reviews with the community.


Before we dive in with the TL:DR reviews (follow by the more in-depth reviews) we need to go over some housekeeping, so without further ado:


Cheesecakes - We tried to stick to plain baked cheesecakes, however, some locations do a single type and thus our hands were tied. That said, before you think that would handicap the competition, our winners were largely plain type!


The Rating System - My lords, my ladies, and everybody else here not sitting on a cushion: A 5/10 is not a bad rating. 5/10 is ""average"" but that's NOT BAD, that is the standard everyone should strive to be. A 5/10 is what everyone SHOULD be, it's ""satisfactory"", and it's the rating your job gives you so they don't have to pay you more during your performance review. Above a 5 means you're doing something out of the ordinary, something special, something unique, or your value is a cut above. Below a 5 means you have room to improve. All scores are averaged from all people in attendance of the crawl and agreed upon uniformly at the end of the crawl.


Value Score: For those who want the best flavour for the best price. These might not always be 10s, however, these provide great flavour without breaking the bank, for those more price conscious folk, like ourselves. So how does this work? We divide the price by its rating, it's that simple! The closer to 0 (zero), the better the value.


The Reviewers - These were reviewed by the 4 members of Best Bites, Justin, Diep, Damo, and Tati


Negative Reviews/Comparisons - Best Bites Uncovered is about finding the best, in order to do so, we have to compare. We cannot claim one place to the best, without a comparison point. Best literally means better than X. We are not attacking anyone, We are simply being honest and upfront about our opinions and experiences having visited these places. We implore you, if you have not tried some of the places rated, please do so before disagreeing as we’re sure if you tried the best on this list, you might change your mind about what you thought was best previously!

Now let’s crack into it starting with our top!


Place - Location - Rating - Price


Liloh Cakery - Online - 10/10 - $30.00 for a whole, $7.50 per slice

This cheesecake, THIS CHEESECAKE, this is a masterpiece, a magnum opus, an ode to culinary greatness, and we don't say that lightly. Liloh Cakery has perfected the cheesecake in ways we've never seen by anyone before, and we're so here for it. This cheesecake was moist, super moist, and as you can clearly see from the photos, the middle was ooey and gooey and absolutely jaw droppingly incredible, while the outer shell was thick, yet soft and tender, and not a drop of dryness anywhere, even on the exterior. The flavours were incredible. The cheesecake tasted creamy, we're not even sure how to explain that, but it was like an incredible creamy thick vanilla gelato, with cheesy goodness that you could taste from what we're sure is very high quality cream cheese. That said, the cheesy flavour had this almost savouryness to it which, like how salt brings out the flavour in chocolate, brought out the flavour of the sweetness from the cream in the dairy in this. Overall, this was a standout from first bite, this was one of those places you know from first bite is a winner, this was fireworks at a symphony, and so much more. Not only that, the price is extremely decent for what you get which is incredible! Liloh Cakery is truly sharing a passion, and a talent, with our community and we can't wait to come back and support them time and time again because this was a wow factor we but rarely have here in Auckland.


Rolo Cakery - Online - 9.5/10 - $11.00

This is no normal cheesecake, this is mochi wrapped creamy cheesecake, and it nearly came in first place! If you've ever had mochi ice cream, you'll know what we mean when we describe this. This isn't too sweet, yet the flavours shine through brightly. We ordered the oreo and the hojicha, and both were lightly flavoured, but also let the cream cheese itself shine through. That cheesy flavour though, just like Liloh, added a complexity of almost savoury flavour, which brought out the natural sweetness even more, and it was delicious! The cheesecake texture is so creamy, but not too creamy where it becomes rich in nature. We'd call the texture, velvety perfection. The base is packed with more flavour, based on the flavour you're ordering, and the mochi, it's not even fair to the others, but that's what makes this unique, that's what makes this ""out of the box"" and is why this rates so highly. Without the mochi this would still be one of the top and we think we'd rate it the same, but regardless, that ingenuity, it makes this a no brainer for where this placed. We're huge fans of their cakes, and their cheesecakes are no exception. This is definitely more for those who enjoy mochi ice cream, but even still, this holds up against most of the others.


Kazuya - Eden Terrace - 9/10 - $22.50 for a whole, $11.25 per slice

This was a really good cheesecake. Now, before we dive in, you must know, you have to call and order this cheesecake, it's not on their website, it's not on the menu, but that said, it's worth the call. You get two of the slices you see above, so enough for two people really, three if you stretch it. With that said, this thing packed flavours of cream cheese and vanilla bean, without being too sweet, but it was sweet enough that it definitely filled the need for a good dessert. The texture on this was masterclass, perfectly thick, creamy, but light at the same time in a way. The top may look at tad dark, but this was not burnt whatsoever. Honestly, we could eat this all day, every day, There's not much more we can say here other than, you need to try this!


Maggie Bakery - Auckland CBD - 9/10 - $10.00

Okay, sit down, we need to talk, because Maggie Bakery is no laughing matter, this place is incredible, and our highest rated bakery where you can just show up, and grab a slice, and for some of you, we know this is going to become your go-to spot now. This cheesecake was a symphony of flavour and texture in ways most other cheesecakes could only dream of being. Plus the inclusion of fresh fruit just sends this over the top. That said, let's talk about this more in-depth. This cheesecake, as you can see from the photos, had a near gooey center, in a good way, and overall was moist and creamy in the best ways, in the absolute best ways. That said, it actually held up as a semi-thicker cheesecake which we kind of liked, the contrast of textures was delightful. The flavours are what sent this into the next dimension though, this was packed with cream cheese flavour, but wasn't too cheesy, yet had some other light flavours going on we couldn't put our fingers on. It was perfectly sweet, teasing us enough that we loved it as a dessert, but not enough that we couldn't finish the whole thing which, finish the whole thing we did! The cream on top was perfect to bring everything together with the fresh fruit. If you're looking for a quick cheesecake fix and don't want to wait and order online, this is your new go-to place, so get over there ASAP! Parking can be a pain for their downtown location, however, we heard they just opened in the new Foodie asian grocer near Costco! Honestly we can't wait to come back and try more of their stuff!


De’s Cuisine - Grey Lynn/Parnell Markets - 8.5/10 - $9.00

All we can really say here is wow, we were not expecting this to go as hard as it did. This cheesecake, this was on another level. The creaminess, but denseness, but fluffiness, the three together make no sense, but it's how this was, and you're going to have to accept that explanation. This was perfectly sweet, and the flavours were just beyond that of normal cheesecake, there was something else here, vanilla, citrus, and something. From first bite this easily found it's place to the top of our rankings and we're so mad we didn't buy more! This was a marvel of a cheesecake and we can't wait to get more.


Fankery - Online & Pop-Ups - 8/10 - $22.50

A few months ago we got the 3-part matcha cheesecake bundle from Fankery which cost us over $40 for 3 slices of cheesecake. It was some of the worst cheesecake we've ever had, the flavours, the textures, it was just not good. Now, everyone has something to say about Fankery, good or bad, but our take has always been, and continues to be, that this is the most expensive cheesecake, per volume, to any cheesecake that exists in Auckland, and probably throughout New Zealand. Times are rough, Aucklanders are struggling, and we do feel there's a bit of price gouging happening here because while this received a high score, we can confidently tell you it is not worth the price for what you get.

Regardless, here we are, and honestly, we've gotta say, this plain version with the brownie base slaps, and it slaps hard. When it comes to basic cheesecake, Fankery seems to know what they're doing, better than most! The texture here was everything you'd want from a cheesecake, it wasn't eggy, it was smooth, dense but not dense (if you get what we mean). It wasn't burnt on top but still had that baked top, it wasn't too sweet and the brownie bottom was moist and tasty, not overpowering of chocolate, but actually really well balanced. The mochi was nearly perfect, albeit, it was still a tad harder than we'd want, but we still really enjoyed this. This was nearly a masterclass in cheesecake, and was so well balanced and honestly, we're so surprised!

Fankery is trying to market itself as almost a fashion brand, a luxury brand, and people are buying into it, which is fine, however, there are better cheesecakes for half of what this cost that taste better, but we have to give it to Fankery, they do make a really good basic cheesecake.


Ragtag - Westmere - 8/10 - $11.00

This was no surprise, by the end of our meal at Ragtag, we knew this was going to be good, and sure enough, it was, it really was. This was creamy, but dense enough that you could scoop a bite with a fork, the flavours were amazing, almost as if they added a bit of sour cream, but we loved that about this. the whipped cream on top was a very nice addition and everything was just perfectly sweet. There wasn't really a base, and honestly, we were okay with that. This was well balanced, really enjoyable, and we can't recommend it enough. The only caveat being the lemon did over power a bit, and the top was a bit more basque than we would've liked, but, if you love lemon, this could be your ten. Still, an 8/10 is a heck of a score and we love this place!


Uncle Tetsu - Rosedale - 8/10 - $26.50 for a whole, $6.63 per slice

If you know, you know, Uncle Tetsu's Japanese cheesecakes are legendary. Okay okay, so they're not ""real cheesecakes"" but we're including them anyways and we won't apologise for it. For those that don't know, this is more of a cheesecake bread, or a cheesecake sponge cake, but this is so light, so fluffy, so moist, that it's borderline an actual cheesecake. That said, the flavour, it's cheesecake in it's finest form, cream cheese and vanilla flavour, cake flavour, yes we said cake flavour, you know what we mean, that awesome white/yellow cake mix in a box flavour that is cheap, yet you love it, we love it, everyone loves it, and when matched with those cheesecake/vanilla flavours, it hits hard. We would say this could feed 8, but with how light it is, hoenstly, you really only get 4 pieces as most people would probably eat a quarter of this to feel as full as an 1/8th slice would of a ""normal"" cheesecake. We're sad Uncle Tetsu closed their CBD location, however, we'll keep coming to North Shore for this again and again because this thing is awesome.


Corelli’s Cafe - Devonport - 7.5/10 - $9.50

Yes, we're trying to do basic cheesecakes, however, they only had this, so here we are, that said, we are taking this into account for flavour and are trying our darndest to be impartial to this fact. Diving in though, this was a good cheese, a very good cheesecake, light, but creamy, not dense, but thick, sweet, but not overly so, and there was another flavour (not the berries) in the cheesecake itself we couldn't put our finger on. The base was nice, a tad moist which actually worked well, and provided a good balance. It may not look like much in photos, but she be mighty!


Frasers - Mount Eden - 7.5/10 - $10.90

This was a darn good cheesecake and reminded us immediately of a really good NY style cheesecake. This was thick, but not dense, it was sweet, but not overly, you could taste cream cheese, but it wasn't ""cheesy"", this was nearly a masterclass in cheesecakes, there just wasn't enough to take it over that upper quartile of our scale as we wanted a little more developed flavour from this as it was a little one note. Now, we know what you're probably thinking ""but Best Bites, aren't you specifically trying a plain cheesecake, plain cheesecake is one-note"" to which we'd agree but also disagree. A masterclass plain cheesecake would probably rate as a 7.5/8 on our scale because remember, above a 5 means you're thinking ""outside of the box"" or doing something great with technique, with places above a 7.5/10 doing both of those things. They nailed the technique, and maybe if they added a little vanilla bean, or something, it would've taken it to that next level, however, a masterclass plain cheesecake this is, and it rated right where we thought it would/should. We don't try to always find winners, this is why it's important to read our ratings, because sometimes the places we find in the 7/10 to 9/10 range are some amazing places you should try, and Frasers is one of those places. We'd come back for this cheesecake, and we can see why people rate it. This topped with some fresh strawberry and cream would easily send us.


Pastrami & Rye - Ellerslie - 7.5/10 - $8.50

Pastrami & Rye does a lot of things well, and their cheesecake is no exception. This thing is nearly identical to what you'd get in New York, and we're so happy about it. The thick creaminess that was also a tad fluffy, almost like if a no-baked cheesecake was baked without it being baked, again, that makes no sense, but trust us when we say, if you had a slice, you'd understand our conundrum of trying to explain this wonderful texture. The flavour was of sweetened cream cheese, vanilla, and a touch of egg which, actually was balanced so well and we loved it. Topped with the ever so slight addition of strawberry brought this whole thing together to nearly perfection. The ONLY reason this was knocked down to where it lays is that the bottom base was far too thick and hard. We love a good graham cracker crust, but this was hard, very hard, and we ended up just eating everything above it. Yes we let this sit out at room temp for a bit before eating, and yet it didn't get a touch softer unfortunately. Maybe this was an older slice and had dried out a bit, but either way, we'd 100% get this cheesecake again, and honestly, if you're in for a sandwich, grab a slice of this, you won't regret it!


Candela - Auckland CBD - 7/10 - $20.00

This had all the earmarks of a great cheesecake, but what failed it a higher score, was that it was somewhat ""spongey"" which, wasn't unappealing, but it wasn't ""cheesecake"" like, at least in the sense that we wanted to score this higher, but it was moist! That said, this was a very tasty cheesecake in it's own way, and we definitely enjoyed it, even if we didn't enjoy the price. The phrase everyone used to describe this, almost unanimously was like eating vanilla ice cream, which, again, this isn't a bad thing!


Levain - Blockhouse Bay - 7/10 - $6.90

We've said it before, and we'll say it again, is there anything Levain can't do well? This cheesecake was exactly what we'd come to expect at Levain, full of flavour with a great texture, and it was one of our least expensive slices! You can tell by the photos, this was creamy, moist, cooked perfectly, and was just really good texturally. That said, the reason it didn't score higher is because the flavours didn't punch as hard as some of its competitors such as Kazuya, Maggie, Rolo, and others. That said, make no mistake, it's rating is good, darn good, a 7/10 is a great score, and truly, this was a really really well done cheesecake technique-wise. We just wanted something more from the cheesecake itself in terms of flavour. We tasted cream cheese but that was kind of it, one-note in a way (see our review of Frasers to understand what we mean about one-note here). Still though, we really liked this, and we'll probably be ordering this again and again in the future.


Lunchroom - Onehunga - 6.5/10 - $8.90

Lunchroom fans, we see you, especially after this cheesecake. To be honest, we weren't sure what to expect here, but we didn't expect the punch that this delivered. This was loaded, both inside and on top, with actual strawberry filling, not jarred or frozen stuff, this tasted fresh and we're so here for it! The cheesecake itself was creamy, packed with cream cheese flavour, albeit, it was just a touch sweet, but honestly, we didn't mind that too much. The base was biscuit like though and it didn't balance too well, which kept it from a higher score, but overall, we really liked this, and we'd get this again if we were grabbing a pie for lunch! Also huge props to using a fresh strawberry on top too, not even Fed Deli went that far!


VIBE Coffee Roasters - Wairau Valley - 6.5/10 - $8.90

This had a nice balance between the blueberries and the cheesecake, however, the flavour wasn't as strong as the photos suggest they were and without the berries, this maybe would have been just a 5/10 which, is still a good score. That said, this was a nice cheesecake, it was creamy, thick but not dense, smooth, and you could lightly taste the cream cheese, though, the berries kind of overtook things a bit. All in all this felt more muddled than cohesive, which is strange because this is berry cheesecake, however, it was good, we'd have it again happily, and it's definitely a step above average, but in comparison, it falls short of some of the others with stronger technique and flavours.


Amano - Auckland CBD - 6/10 - $11.00

This cheesecake was good, but only slightly above average. It was creamy, had that cream cheese flavour but wasn't too ""cheesy"", was moist, wasn't overly sweet, but it was lacking something to take it beyond being just a darn good cheesecake. That said, we wouldn't be mad if we got this in the future and enjoyed this.


Miann - Ponsonby - 6/10 - $12.00

This was a pleasantly decent cheesecake, not too sweet, but sweet enough, not too dense, but nice and creamy, and the notes of berries was really a nice touch. That said, there wasn't too much going on here, light flavours, okay texture, but nothing that would wow you. The base was a tad crunchy/dry, but that could be because it had been sitting out for awhile, so we're okay with side-looking that, but nothing about this screamed more than just above average, which, hey, we're okay with, we'd definitely have this again if we were at Miann.


Mizu Bread - Eden Terrace - 6/10 - $12.00

It's interesting, Mizu Bread, we've heard, is owned by the same people who own Kazuya next door, yet, the two cheesecakes they make are drastically different in comparison. With that said, in comparison, this cheesecake is the ugly stepsister to the greater Kazuya cheesecake, however, it's still a darn decent cheesecake delivering a step above average flavours and textures. This cheesecake was a touch dry, yet not dry in the sense of it being left out, but more of in the sense of a touch spongey, probably from the method of creation. Still though, this was creamy. The flavour was nice, we could taste the sweetened cream cheese, however, we could also taste a touch of egg which, we don't mind, it worked here, but it was still there. Overall though, not a bad shout and we'd happily eat this again.


The Gateau House - Stonefields - 5.5/10 - $11.00

Darn decent thick cheesecake. There's not much else to say here. This really was your average slice of cheesecake, exactly what you'd think of when you think cheesecake, both in texture, and flavour. Nothing stood out, but nothing was wrong, and yet, this did stick out a touch past average in flavour. Honestly though, that's where we want to leave this review, because truly, that explains this wholeheartedly.


Folds Patisserie - Mount Eden - 5/10 - $13.00

This was Fold's apple cheesecake (excuse the photos, it took a beating on the trip home). This was just a decent cheesecake, the texture was dense, but not too dense, the cheesecake flavour shined through, and the apple crumble type topping was decent spiced/seasoned that it added to the cheesecake without taking anything away. The base wasn't overly thick and everything wasn't too sweet. That said, nothing really stood out, the flavours weren't really pronounced, and it just didn't do anything, we felt, to set itself apart. It's almost like it tried to, but didn't quite get there, maybe with some additional work. That said, this was a decent cheesecake we'd be happy to eat again as there was nothing wrong with it whatseover.


Mill Bakery - Henderson - 5/10 - $7.20

This was just an average cheesecake, and while we've said it before, we'll keep repeating ourselves that this is not a bad thing! This had everything it needed to be successful, creamy but thick, cream cheese flavour but not cheesy, per se. Was sweet but not too much, but there was nothing that sent it up up and away, nothing that screamed ""I'm special"" where we would want to go out of our way for this. If we were in Henderson and wanted cheesecake after a burger at Kanes, we'd for sure swing by.


OTT patisserie - Birkenhead - 5/10 - $7.00

This was OTT's lemon cheesecake, and it wasn't a bad shout, however, it lacked flavour. This was lightly flavoured, but not in a good way. The phrase used was ""it's neither here, nor there"", as while we're aiming for plain flavours, if you call yourself lemon, be lemon, be the lemon. Instead we got flavour neutrality. That said, the texture was nice, creamy, light, yet thick at the same time, and really well executed. To be honest, we couldn't find a fault with this, and the lemon flavour not being strong isn't a fault, because this was a decent cheesecake, an averagely decent cheesecake, but to get higher they really needed to deliver on flavour.


Ripe Deli - Takapuna - 5/10 - $14.00

This had so much potential from first view, however, that potential quickly faded into what can be described as just a decent experience. This cheesecake had, what we think, is a freeze dried strawberry powder on top of the whipped cream, on top of a strawberry topped cheesecake. Now, the cheesecake itself had flavours of vanilla and cream cheese, however, the egg was a tad strong in flavour, and the sweetness was a bit too much, especially with the berries. You can actually see from the colours of the cheesecake that the egg is definitely pronounced which, we don't always mind, but in this cheesecake, it was a bit off. The berries were super sweet, and a touch sour, which we love, but it took the sweetness of this whole thing over the level. Then the whipped cream which was sweet, and the powered topping, it was sweet on sweet on sweet, which really kept this from getting a better score. We almost dropped this below a 5, however, the flavours were really good and brought this up from under a 5. So just keep in mind if you get this, you're going to be confused at where you would rank this yourself haha. Either way, we can see why people order this, and honestly, if we were in the mood for a sweet treat, we'd probably order it again ourselves, we just wouldn't go out of our way for it.


The Cheesecake Shop - Manukau - 5/10 - $9.90

We weren't sure what to expect from a chain, especially one so little talked about, and yet we were pleasantly surprised. This, by all means, exemplified the 5/10 rating, in all the good ways. This was a staple, a standard; yes this means average but you know how we feel about that word. This was creamy, not dense, very sweet, but in an actually nice way, and the flavour was something extra that we really enjoyed, almost cinnamon sugar type in flavour. The base wasn't dry and held up. This wasn't ""thinking outside of the box"" but it wasn't bad by any stretch of the mind. This was, for all intents and purposes, what a cheesecake should be at a minimum, and we liked it.


Atelier Shu - Newmarket - 4.5/10 - $11.00

We wanted to like this more than we did, we know the calibur of goods that Atelier Shu can produce, however, their burnt basque cheesecake was just that, a tad too burnt, where the carbon flavour came through a bit too strong. The cream on top was nice and light, not too sweet as all their offerings are, and the cheesecake itself was very light and nice. It was creamy, the flavour was great, not cheesy but still cheesecake flavoured, fairly moist, and had it not been burnt this could've been easily a 6.5 or a 7. That said, we rate this overall and overall, we wouldn't want this again even if it was to just pick at the cheesecake inside. Maybe stick to their other goods, because we know Atelier Shu can deliver good products, today just wasn't their day.


Bluebells Cakery - Kingsland - 4.5/10 - $59.00 for a whole, $7.38 per slice

This was cheesecake jello, no lie. There was so much gelatin in this, it wiggled more than The Wiggles themselves. That said, the flavour was really nice which is what kind of ""saved"" this cheesecake, if you consider a below average score ""saving"". Honestly, there are probably people that love this style, it's unique, but it's not cheesecake, and it wasn't for us. The cheesecake flavours were there though, they were pronounced, even though this was their passionfruit version. For the price, we'd probably never order this again, but at a party, we might grab a slice.


Bambina - Newmarket - 4/10 - $8.50

The first thing everyone remarked on was the egg flavour here, which, maybe it's intentional, maybe not, either way, that's really the predominant flavour, but it was cheesecake, it tasted like eggy cheesecake. The texture was a mix of dry and moist, as if it had sat out for awhile, but originally was moist, as the center texture was appealing. That said, it really didn't hold up to average unfortunately.


Costco - Westgate - 4/10 - $34.99 for a whole, $4.37 per slice

Costco does a lot of things right, cheesecake, unfortunately, is not really one of those things, though, it almost landed. The texture was right, and it looks aesthetically pleasing on the eyes, however, this marbled chocolate cheesecake was just far too sweet, and the cheesecake tasted like it had cheap white chocolate in the mix, which, was really unappealing to the palate. If they had ditched the white chocolate and used less sugar, this really would've had a chance because the actual cheesecake flavour that came through, was really well done, but too much was out of balance to really rate this even average unfortunately.


Fed Deli - Auckland CBD - 4/10 - $13.50

Disappointment again... The Fed is officially on our ""do not return"" list after this. We're not sure what's going on at The Fed, but the quality all around has slipped majorly. This cheesecake was dense, super dense, so dense we needed water to drink to get through it, and honestly, that's fine, but this was just sweet, and cream cheese, nothing else, no vanilla or lemon or something to give it something more. If it did, it didn't taste like it. The strawberries were from frozen, which is strange because strawberries can now be found in stores for decent price. The cream was not sweetened whatsoever, it just tasted like whipped heavy cream, nothing else. Overall, this was unimpressive, unenjoyable, and just not what we expect from an Al Brown establishment. The reuben, the hotdog, and now this.


Hollywood Bakery - Auckland CBD - 4/10 - $5.50

Laugh as you will with this getting even a 4/10 but believe it or not, this was kinda alright. The cheesecake flavour was there, it wasn't overly sweet, though it was sweet, the bottom wasn't bad, though it wasn't great, it tasted like a biscuit bottom, and the passionfruit topping was balanced actually, albeit, definitely from a jar. That said, we had worse cheesecakes and, in comparison, this actually rates as a 4/10. We'd eat this again if we had to, which is more than we can say for some places we went, and the price is alright!


Le Macaron - Takapuna - 4/10 - $12.20

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. We almost gave this average, however, we all agreed we wouldn't want to eat it again, which really puts it below a five (fives we will eat again!). It was very thin, the burnt flavour same through a bit strong, probably because there wasn't much cheesecake itself to balance it out, and the cheesecake itself was dry and just, lacking any real flavour. It was weird, you ever have that cheap vanilla ice cream from the store, the one that says vanilla but then you eat it and you're just like, this tastes like frozen milk with sugar, it's kind of like that.


ThreeBarFifty - Online and Popups - 4/10 - $13.00

This had so much potential, so much potential, but it fell short for two reasons: This was much too sweet, and much too burnt. The cheesecake itself had a good texture, creamy, a touch gooey, yet thick enough to hold together. The flavour was decent, cream cheese came through, but was a tad one-note, but honestly, that might be because of the burnt top, bottom, and sides. We're all for creme brulee, we LOVE creme brulee, but they burnt this sugar a bit too much, and with the overcooked bottom and top, it just really didn't help this cheesecake get over the line. Additionally, that burnt sweetness, took this far too far in the sweet department to have this really be enjoyable. We had such high hopes, ThreeBarFifty seem like they're really trying to think outside the box, but this needs a touch more work on execution to really be up there with the greats.


Coffee Pen - Eden Terrace - 3.5/10 - $12.50

This was supposed to be an apple caramel cheesecake, and again, like most of the flavoured cheesecakes, this just did not land. First off, the walnut pieces just didn't belong here, it was not the right nut choice, secondly, the caramel layer between the cheesecake and the base was much too sweet and tasted nothing like caramel, more just a semi-liquid sugar sauce that looks like caramel. The apples were actually really nicely spiced and had a good texture, and the cheesecake layer itself was decent, good texture, good cream cheese but also good spice flavour. The base was hard though and altogether, this was imbalanced and just didn't come together cohesively.


Baker & co. - Wai O Taiki Bay - 3/10 - $8.00

This was their brownie cheesecake, which was neither a brownie, nor a cheesecake. This thing, it was so sweet, had some berry flavour bites, but practically no chocolate flavour, and no cheesecake flavour. It tasted like boxed cake mix that was more moist, but three times as sweet.


Circus Circus - Mount Eden - 3/10 - $13.90

This was supposed to be a crunchie bar cheesecake, but instead, it was a mess of texture and weird flavours that really makes us wonder, how is Circus Circus still in business, because we've had nothing but misses from this place. This tasted like a chocolate caramel mousse cake, instead of a cheesecake, and tasted nothing like cheesecake. It was very sweet, it was very unbalanced, and it was not well received by anyone in the group.


Crafty Baker - Titirangi - 3/10 - $9.00

We like to say ""the photos tell the story here"" for a reason, because the photos really tell a story. This was dry, dense, eggy, and the blueberries tasted frozen which, isn't necessarily a bad thing sometimes, but this was just, off, as if they had been freezer burned. Either way, we really didn't enjoy this cheesecake.


Esther at QT - Auckland CBD - 3/10 - $18.00

Note - This comes with chocolate ice cream (not pictured)
This is Esther's basque cheesecake with orange marmalade and let us tell you, this cheesecake was an experience in flavour, but not in the ways you'd think. The aftertaste of this cheesecake tasted like rendered pork fat, and no, we're not kidding. What we think happened here is that they baked this in an oven at some point that was used to bake/make some kind of pork dish, because the flavour was definitely there, and it wasn't just one of us that made this remark. That said, the flavour of this was nice, they definitely nailed the cheesecake portion of this, no burnt flavour, smooth texture, could taste the cream cheese was it wasn't ""cheesy"". The orange topping though, we could've done without it, it was bitter, and added nothing to the cheesecake. This could have stood on its own without the topping. Regardless, we can only rate what we get the day of, and maybe this day was a fluke, but the weird pork flavour threw us for a loop and we just didn't enjoy it.


Little Luscious Cafe - Ellerslie - 2/10 - $7.50

This was Little Luscious's Russian fudge cheesecake, and it was not good. This was just gooey sweet overload that none of us enjoyed whatsoever. The top was like a caramel layer, and the cheesecake itself was a thick goo type texture which we really just didn't understand. The sugar on this was cranked up to absurd levels to the point where it felt like chewing on a butterscotch candy.


Hell Pizza - Flat Bush - 1.5/10 - $6.00

This was not good, we normally try to be nice in our reviews, but we can't here, no one liked this, and we threw half of this out, and we never do that (we hate food waste). This was Hell's ​kahlua and white chocolate cheesecake with a gingernut base and it should've just stayed in Hell, where it belongs. This was overly sweet, really overly sweet, and the white chocolate flavour was extremely unpleasant. The kahlua didn't help here, and the gingerbread bottom just had us confused. These flavours don't work well together and we'd never order this again. We'd be really surprised if anyone actually liked this, how is this on their menu still?


Noughts & Crosses - Mount Eden - 1/10 - $12.75

This was quite possibly one of the worst cheesecakes we ate, and while we don't like to bring places down, especially local places, we've gotta say something here because we rarely give scores of 1/10 as 1/10 is downright inedible, which this was. This was the driest cheesecake we ate, and we're pretty sure it's because this had sat out at least overnight, if not for a couple of days. Now, we get it, baked goods are an overhead of a product, anything thrown out is a ""loss"", however, we also know that profits can never come before quality. This was so dry, and held together so well, we tossed the piece back and forth just to see if it'd stay together and it did, we did this a few times. You can see from the photos, it looks like at one point this was moist, it looks like the bottom and the middle still had a touch of life to it, but everything else tasted like if powder was a flavour. Maybe it was a bad day, maybe this is good normally, however, we were sold this, Noughts & Crosses made a conscious decision to serve this, and we rate what we get. Either way, if this is what is being served, we can't recommend anyone ever coming here.

1gbmcqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1gbmcqr/how_do_i_help_my_friend/,How do I help my friend?,"My longtime friend (26F) has started to get into heavy drinking and weekly drug use (party drugs like cocaine, acid, ketamine, etc.) within this past year. Her father died this summer and her uncle shortly thereafter. She had moved across the US to have better opportunity and lives in the state that I am in now. She was never super close with her family emotionally but has always felt responsible, so much so that she has sent money to her father, mother, and older sister so they can pay rent and utilities. Long story short, she has a rough past and rough family situation. 

Her drug and alcohol abuse has gotten so bad that I've noticed that she is often slurring her words and misspelling texts more than she used to. She recently kept showing up to work late at her coffee shop job and decided to look for something else that's later in the day so she can be on time. She tried a restaraunt but got fired shortly due to being late. I've tried reaching out to just hang out or do anything so we can talk or just so I can support her in some way but she always ghosts me. Her roommate who is much like her found sister recently attempted and I'm worried about the impact that that has had on her as well. 

It frustrates me that I am just watching all of this happen and I feel like I can't do anything. She keeps hanging out with people who buy her drinks and supply drugs but avoids me it seems. It hurts, but I know she's hurting more. I've tried explaining to her all of this and she just hits me with the ""sorry, I know I'm a shit friend"". 

I wish she could just snap out of it!

Is there really anything I can do to encourage her to get help, or do I just have to wait this out and watch?

I've thought about signing her up for AA newsletters to get in her email or mail but idk if that would be invasive?",3,1729831522.0,alcoholism,0,1.0,False

1gbmbvq,https://imgur.com/gallery/great-2024-auckland-cheesecake-crawl-W5OiyHp,The Great 2024 Auckland Cheesecake Crawl,"Cheesecake: the ultimate indulgence, creamy, sweet, somewhat savoury, and oh so satisfying. We’ve heard that Auckland has no good cheesecake, so we set out, and conquered 40 cheesecakes to see if there was any truth to that statement, and the reality couldn’t be further away. Auckland’s cheesecake game is strong, extraordinarily strong, so buckle up, this is a wild ride!


Before we jump into the review, allow us to introduce ourselves, we are a group of four friends, teaming up with you, our community, to do food crawls on the weekends for fun, finding some of Auckland’s best bites. To date we’ve done burgers, hot dogs, tacos, and more!


All food is paid for, we do not provide advertising, and we are not affiliated with any locations.


If you’re interested in coming along to a crawl in the future, please dm us and let us know, we’d love to have you along. We split the food and the costs to make the crawls manageable.


Note - We have been given pre-approval from mods to post here. We’re not looking to gain anything, we simply want to share our reviews with the community.


Before we dive in with the TL:DR reviews (follow by the more in-depth reviews) we need to go over some housekeeping, so without further ado:


Cheesecakes - We tried to stick to plain baked cheesecakes, however, some locations do a single type and thus our hands were tied. That said, before you think that would handicap the competition, our winners were largely plain type!


The Rating System - My lords, my ladies, and everybody else here not sitting on a cushion: A 5/10 is not a bad rating. 5/10 is ""average"" but that's NOT BAD, that is the standard everyone should strive to be. A 5/10 is what everyone SHOULD be, it's ""satisfactory"", and it's the rating your job gives you so they don't have to pay you more during your performance review. Above a 5 means you're doing something out of the ordinary, something special, something unique, or your value is a cut above. Below a 5 means you have room to improve. All scores are averaged from all people in attendance of the crawl and agreed upon uniformly at the end of the crawl.


Value Score: For those who want the best flavour for the best price. These might not always be 10s, however, these provide great flavour without breaking the bank, for those more price conscious folk, like ourselves. So how does this work? We divide the price by its rating, it's that simple! The closer to 0 (zero), the better the value.


The Reviewers - These were reviewed by the 4 members of Best Bites, Justin, Diep, Damo, and Tati


Negative Reviews/Comparisons - Best Bites Uncovered is about finding the best, in order to do so, we have to compare. We cannot claim one place to the best, without a comparison point. Best literally means better than X. We are not attacking anyone, We are simply being honest and upfront about our opinions and experiences having visited these places. We implore you, if you have not tried some of the places rated, please do so before disagreeing as we’re sure if you tried the best on this list, you might change your mind about what you thought was best previously!

Now let’s crack into it starting with our top!


Place - Location - Rating - Price


Liloh Cakery - Online - 10/10 - $30.00 for a whole, $7.50 per slice

This cheesecake, THIS CHEESECAKE, this is a masterpiece, a magnum opus, an ode to culinary greatness, and we don't say that lightly. Liloh Cakery has perfected the cheesecake in ways we've never seen by anyone before, and we're so here for it. This cheesecake was moist, super moist, and as you can clearly see from the photos, the middle was ooey and gooey and absolutely jaw droppingly incredible, while the outer shell was thick, yet soft and tender, and not a drop of dryness anywhere, even on the exterior. The flavours were incredible. The cheesecake tasted creamy, we're not even sure how to explain that, but it was like an incredible creamy thick vanilla gelato, with cheesy goodness that you could taste from what we're sure is very high quality cream cheese. That said, the cheesy flavour had this almost savouryness to it which, like how salt brings out the flavour in chocolate, brought out the flavour of the sweetness from the cream in the dairy in this. Overall, this was a standout from first bite, this was one of those places you know from first bite is a winner, this was fireworks at a symphony, and so much more. Not only that, the price is extremely decent for what you get which is incredible! Liloh Cakery is truly sharing a passion, and a talent, with our community and we can't wait to come back and support them time and time again because this was a wow factor we but rarely have here in Auckland.


Rolo Cakery - Online - 9.5/10 - $11.00

This is no normal cheesecake, this is mochi wrapped creamy cheesecake, and it nearly came in first place! If you've ever had mochi ice cream, you'll know what we mean when we describe this. This isn't too sweet, yet the flavours shine through brightly. We ordered the oreo and the hojicha, and both were lightly flavoured, but also let the cream cheese itself shine through. That cheesy flavour though, just like Liloh, added a complexity of almost savoury flavour, which brought out the natural sweetness even more, and it was delicious! The cheesecake texture is so creamy, but not too creamy where it becomes rich in nature. We'd call the texture, velvety perfection. The base is packed with more flavour, based on the flavour you're ordering, and the mochi, it's not even fair to the others, but that's what makes this unique, that's what makes this ""out of the box"" and is why this rates so highly. Without the mochi this would still be one of the top and we think we'd rate it the same, but regardless, that ingenuity, it makes this a no brainer for where this placed. We're huge fans of their cakes, and their cheesecakes are no exception. This is definitely more for those who enjoy mochi ice cream, but even still, this holds up against most of the others.


Kazuya - Eden Terrace - 9/10 - $22.50 for a whole, $11.25 per slice

This was a really good cheesecake. Now, before we dive in, you must know, you have to call and order this cheesecake, it's not on their website, it's not on the menu, but that said, it's worth the call. You get two of the slices you see above, so enough for two people really, three if you stretch it. With that said, this thing packed flavours of cream cheese and vanilla bean, without being too sweet, but it was sweet enough that it definitely filled the need for a good dessert. The texture on this was masterclass, perfectly thick, creamy, but light at the same time in a way. The top may look at tad dark, but this was not burnt whatsoever. Honestly, we could eat this all day, every day, There's not much more we can say here other than, you need to try this!


Maggie Bakery - Auckland CBD - 9/10 - $10.00

Okay, sit down, we need to talk, because Maggie Bakery is no laughing matter, this place is incredible, and our highest rated bakery where you can just show up, and grab a slice, and for some of you, we know this is going to become your go-to spot now. This cheesecake was a symphony of flavour and texture in ways most other cheesecakes could only dream of being. Plus the inclusion of fresh fruit just sends this over the top. That said, let's talk about this more in-depth. This cheesecake, as you can see from the photos, had a near gooey center, in a good way, and overall was moist and creamy in the best ways, in the absolute best ways. That said, it actually held up as a semi-thicker cheesecake which we kind of liked, the contrast of textures was delightful. The flavours are what sent this into the next dimension though, this was packed with cream cheese flavour, but wasn't too cheesy, yet had some other light flavours going on we couldn't put our fingers on. It was perfectly sweet, teasing us enough that we loved it as a dessert, but not enough that we couldn't finish the whole thing which, finish the whole thing we did! The cream on top was perfect to bring everything together with the fresh fruit. If you're looking for a quick cheesecake fix and don't want to wait and order online, this is your new go-to place, so get over there ASAP! Parking can be a pain for their downtown location, however, we heard they just opened in the new Foodie asian grocer near Costco! Honestly we can't wait to come back and try more of their stuff!


De’s Cuisine - Grey Lynn/Parnell Markets - 8.5/10 - $9.00

All we can really say here is wow, we were not expecting this to go as hard as it did. This cheesecake, this was on another level. The creaminess, but denseness, but fluffiness, the three together make no sense, but it's how this was, and you're going to have to accept that explanation. This was perfectly sweet, and the flavours were just beyond that of normal cheesecake, there was something else here, vanilla, citrus, and something. From first bite this easily found it's place to the top of our rankings and we're so mad we didn't buy more! This was a marvel of a cheesecake and we can't wait to get more.


Fankery - Online & Pop-Ups - 8/10 - $22.50

A few months ago we got the 3-part matcha cheesecake bundle from Fankery which cost us over $40 for 3 slices of cheesecake. It was some of the worst cheesecake we've ever had, the flavours, the textures, it was just not good. Now, everyone has something to say about Fankery, good or bad, but our take has always been, and continues to be, that this is the most expensive cheesecake, per volume, to any cheesecake that exists in Auckland, and probably throughout New Zealand. Times are rough, Aucklanders are struggling, and we do feel there's a bit of price gouging happening here because while this received a high score, we can confidently tell you it is not worth the price for what you get.

Regardless, here we are, and honestly, we've gotta say, this plain version with the brownie base slaps, and it slaps hard. When it comes to basic cheesecake, Fankery seems to know what they're doing, better than most! The texture here was everything you'd want from a cheesecake, it wasn't eggy, it was smooth, dense but not dense (if you get what we mean). It wasn't burnt on top but still had that baked top, it wasn't too sweet and the brownie bottom was moist and tasty, not overpowering of chocolate, but actually really well balanced. The mochi was nearly perfect, albeit, it was still a tad harder than we'd want, but we still really enjoyed this. This was nearly a masterclass in cheesecake, and was so well balanced and honestly, we're so surprised!

Fankery is trying to market itself as almost a fashion brand, a luxury brand, and people are buying into it, which is fine, however, there are better cheesecakes for half of what this cost that taste better, but we have to give it to Fankery, they do make a really good basic cheesecake.


Ragtag - Westmere - 8/10 - $11.00

This was no surprise, by the end of our meal at Ragtag, we knew this was going to be good, and sure enough, it was, it really was. This was creamy, but dense enough that you could scoop a bite with a fork, the flavours were amazing, almost as if they added a bit of sour cream, but we loved that about this. the whipped cream on top was a very nice addition and everything was just perfectly sweet. There wasn't really a base, and honestly, we were okay with that. This was well balanced, really enjoyable, and we can't recommend it enough. The only caveat being the lemon did over power a bit, and the top was a bit more basque than we would've liked, but, if you love lemon, this could be your ten. Still, an 8/10 is a heck of a score and we love this place!


Uncle Tetsu - Rosedale - 8/10 - $26.50 for a whole, $6.63 per slice

If you know, you know, Uncle Tetsu's Japanese cheesecakes are legendary. Okay okay, so they're not ""real cheesecakes"" but we're including them anyways and we won't apologise for it. For those that don't know, this is more of a cheesecake bread, or a cheesecake sponge cake, but this is so light, so fluffy, so moist, that it's borderline an actual cheesecake. That said, the flavour, it's cheesecake in it's finest form, cream cheese and vanilla flavour, cake flavour, yes we said cake flavour, you know what we mean, that awesome white/yellow cake mix in a box flavour that is cheap, yet you love it, we love it, everyone loves it, and when matched with those cheesecake/vanilla flavours, it hits hard. We would say this could feed 8, but with how light it is, hoenstly, you really only get 4 pieces as most people would probably eat a quarter of this to feel as full as an 1/8th slice would of a ""normal"" cheesecake. We're sad Uncle Tetsu closed their CBD location, however, we'll keep coming to North Shore for this again and again because this thing is awesome.


Corelli’s Cafe - Devonport - 7.5/10 - $9.50

Yes, we're trying to do basic cheesecakes, however, they only had this, so here we are, that said, we are taking this into account for flavour and are trying our darndest to be impartial to this fact. Diving in though, this was a good cheese, a very good cheesecake, light, but creamy, not dense, but thick, sweet, but not overly so, and there was another flavour (not the berries) in the cheesecake itself we couldn't put our finger on. The base was nice, a tad moist which actually worked well, and provided a good balance. It may not look like much in photos, but she be mighty!


Frasers - Mount Eden - 7.5/10 - $10.90

This was a darn good cheesecake and reminded us immediately of a really good NY style cheesecake. This was thick, but not dense, it was sweet, but not overly, you could taste cream cheese, but it wasn't ""cheesy"", this was nearly a masterclass in cheesecakes, there just wasn't enough to take it over that upper quartile of our scale as we wanted a little more developed flavour from this as it was a little one note. Now, we know what you're probably thinking ""but Best Bites, aren't you specifically trying a plain cheesecake, plain cheesecake is one-note"" to which we'd agree but also disagree. A masterclass plain cheesecake would probably rate as a 7.5/8 on our scale because remember, above a 5 means you're thinking ""outside of the box"" or doing something great with technique, with places above a 7.5/10 doing both of those things. They nailed the technique, and maybe if they added a little vanilla bean, or something, it would've taken it to that next level, however, a masterclass plain cheesecake this is, and it rated right where we thought it would/should. We don't try to always find winners, this is why it's important to read our ratings, because sometimes the places we find in the 7/10 to 9/10 range are some amazing places you should try, and Frasers is one of those places. We'd come back for this cheesecake, and we can see why people rate it. This topped with some fresh strawberry and cream would easily send us.


Pastrami & Rye - Ellerslie - 7.5/10 - $8.50

Pastrami & Rye does a lot of things well, and their cheesecake is no exception. This thing is nearly identical to what you'd get in New York, and we're so happy about it. The thick creaminess that was also a tad fluffy, almost like if a no-baked cheesecake was baked without it being baked, again, that makes no sense, but trust us when we say, if you had a slice, you'd understand our conundrum of trying to explain this wonderful texture. The flavour was of sweetened cream cheese, vanilla, and a touch of egg which, actually was balanced so well and we loved it. Topped with the ever so slight addition of strawberry brought this whole thing together to nearly perfection. The ONLY reason this was knocked down to where it lays is that the bottom base was far too thick and hard. We love a good graham cracker crust, but this was hard, very hard, and we ended up just eating everything above it. Yes we let this sit out at room temp for a bit before eating, and yet it didn't get a touch softer unfortunately. Maybe this was an older slice and had dried out a bit, but either way, we'd 100% get this cheesecake again, and honestly, if you're in for a sandwich, grab a slice of this, you won't regret it!


Candela - Auckland CBD - 7/10 - $20.00

This had all the earmarks of a great cheesecake, but what failed it a higher score, was that it was somewhat ""spongey"" which, wasn't unappealing, but it wasn't ""cheesecake"" like, at least in the sense that we wanted to score this higher, but it was moist! That said, this was a very tasty cheesecake in it's own way, and we definitely enjoyed it, even if we didn't enjoy the price. The phrase everyone used to describe this, almost unanimously was like eating vanilla ice cream, which, again, this isn't a bad thing!


Levain - Blockhouse Bay - 7/10 - $6.90

We've said it before, and we'll say it again, is there anything Levain can't do well? This cheesecake was exactly what we'd come to expect at Levain, full of flavour with a great texture, and it was one of our least expensive slices! You can tell by the photos, this was creamy, moist, cooked perfectly, and was just really good texturally. That said, the reason it didn't score higher is because the flavours didn't punch as hard as some of its competitors such as Kazuya, Maggie, Rolo, and others. That said, make no mistake, it's rating is good, darn good, a 7/10 is a great score, and truly, this was a really really well done cheesecake technique-wise. We just wanted something more from the cheesecake itself in terms of flavour. We tasted cream cheese but that was kind of it, one-note in a way (see our review of Frasers to understand what we mean about one-note here). Still though, we really liked this, and we'll probably be ordering this again and again in the future.


Lunchroom - Onehunga - 6.5/10 - $8.90

Lunchroom fans, we see you, especially after this cheesecake. To be honest, we weren't sure what to expect here, but we didn't expect the punch that this delivered. This was loaded, both inside and on top, with actual strawberry filling, not jarred or frozen stuff, this tasted fresh and we're so here for it! The cheesecake itself was creamy, packed with cream cheese flavour, albeit, it was just a touch sweet, but honestly, we didn't mind that too much. The base was biscuit like though and it didn't balance too well, which kept it from a higher score, but overall, we really liked this, and we'd get this again if we were grabbing a pie for lunch! Also huge props to using a fresh strawberry on top too, not even Fed Deli went that far!


VIBE Coffee Roasters - Wairau Valley - 6.5/10 - $8.90

This had a nice balance between the blueberries and the cheesecake, however, the flavour wasn't as strong as the photos suggest they were and without the berries, this maybe would have been just a 5/10 which, is still a good score. That said, this was a nice cheesecake, it was creamy, thick but not dense, smooth, and you could lightly taste the cream cheese, though, the berries kind of overtook things a bit. All in all this felt more muddled than cohesive, which is strange because this is berry cheesecake, however, it was good, we'd have it again happily, and it's definitely a step above average, but in comparison, it falls short of some of the others with stronger technique and flavours.


Amano - Auckland CBD - 6/10 - $11.00

This cheesecake was good, but only slightly above average. It was creamy, had that cream cheese flavour but wasn't too ""cheesy"", was moist, wasn't overly sweet, but it was lacking something to take it beyond being just a darn good cheesecake. That said, we wouldn't be mad if we got this in the future and enjoyed this.


Miann - Ponsonby - 6/10 - $12.00

This was a pleasantly decent cheesecake, not too sweet, but sweet enough, not too dense, but nice and creamy, and the notes of berries was really a nice touch. That said, there wasn't too much going on here, light flavours, okay texture, but nothing that would wow you. The base was a tad crunchy/dry, but that could be because it had been sitting out for awhile, so we're okay with side-looking that, but nothing about this screamed more than just above average, which, hey, we're okay with, we'd definitely have this again if we were at Miann.


Mizu Bread - Eden Terrace - 6/10 - $12.00

It's interesting, Mizu Bread, we've heard, is owned by the same people who own Kazuya next door, yet, the two cheesecakes they make are drastically different in comparison. With that said, in comparison, this cheesecake is the ugly stepsister to the greater Kazuya cheesecake, however, it's still a darn decent cheesecake delivering a step above average flavours and textures. This cheesecake was a touch dry, yet not dry in the sense of it being left out, but more of in the sense of a touch spongey, probably from the method of creation. Still though, this was creamy. The flavour was nice, we could taste the sweetened cream cheese, however, we could also taste a touch of egg which, we don't mind, it worked here, but it was still there. Overall though, not a bad shout and we'd happily eat this again.


The Gateau House - Stonefields - 5.5/10 - $11.00

Darn decent thick cheesecake. There's not much else to say here. This really was your average slice of cheesecake, exactly what you'd think of when you think cheesecake, both in texture, and flavour. Nothing stood out, but nothing was wrong, and yet, this did stick out a touch past average in flavour. Honestly though, that's where we want to leave this review, because truly, that explains this wholeheartedly.


Folds Patisserie - Mount Eden - 5/10 - $13.00

This was Fold's apple cheesecake (excuse the photos, it took a beating on the trip home). This was just a decent cheesecake, the texture was dense, but not too dense, the cheesecake flavour shined through, and the apple crumble type topping was decent spiced/seasoned that it added to the cheesecake without taking anything away. The base wasn't overly thick and everything wasn't too sweet. That said, nothing really stood out, the flavours weren't really pronounced, and it just didn't do anything, we felt, to set itself apart. It's almost like it tried to, but didn't quite get there, maybe with some additional work. That said, this was a decent cheesecake we'd be happy to eat again as there was nothing wrong with it whatseover.


Mill Bakery - Henderson - 5/10 - $7.20

This was just an average cheesecake, and while we've said it before, we'll keep repeating ourselves that this is not a bad thing! This had everything it needed to be successful, creamy but thick, cream cheese flavour but not cheesy, per se. Was sweet but not too much, but there was nothing that sent it up up and away, nothing that screamed ""I'm special"" where we would want to go out of our way for this. If we were in Henderson and wanted cheesecake after a burger at Kanes, we'd for sure swing by.


OTT patisserie - Birkenhead - 5/10 - $7.00

This was OTT's lemon cheesecake, and it wasn't a bad shout, however, it lacked flavour. This was lightly flavoured, but not in a good way. The phrase used was ""it's neither here, nor there"", as while we're aiming for plain flavours, if you call yourself lemon, be lemon, be the lemon. Instead we got flavour neutrality. That said, the texture was nice, creamy, light, yet thick at the same time, and really well executed. To be honest, we couldn't find a fault with this, and the lemon flavour not being strong isn't a fault, because this was a decent cheesecake, an averagely decent cheesecake, but to get higher they really needed to deliver on flavour.


Ripe Deli - Takapuna - 5/10 - $14.00

This had so much potential from first view, however, that potential quickly faded into what can be described as just a decent experience. This cheesecake had, what we think, is a freeze dried strawberry powder on top of the whipped cream, on top of a strawberry topped cheesecake. Now, the cheesecake itself had flavours of vanilla and cream cheese, however, the egg was a tad strong in flavour, and the sweetness was a bit too much, especially with the berries. You can actually see from the colours of the cheesecake that the egg is definitely pronounced which, we don't always mind, but in this cheesecake, it was a bit off. The berries were super sweet, and a touch sour, which we love, but it took the sweetness of this whole thing over the level. Then the whipped cream which was sweet, and the powered topping, it was sweet on sweet on sweet, which really kept this from getting a better score. We almost dropped this below a 5, however, the flavours were really good and brought this up from under a 5. So just keep in mind if you get this, you're going to be confused at where you would rank this yourself haha. Either way, we can see why people order this, and honestly, if we were in the mood for a sweet treat, we'd probably order it again ourselves, we just wouldn't go out of our way for it.


The Cheesecake Shop - Manukau - 5/10 - $9.90

We weren't sure what to expect from a chain, especially one so little talked about, and yet we were pleasantly surprised. This, by all means, exemplified the 5/10 rating, in all the good ways. This was a staple, a standard; yes this means average but you know how we feel about that word. This was creamy, not dense, very sweet, but in an actually nice way, and the flavour was something extra that we really enjoyed, almost cinnamon sugar type in flavour. The base wasn't dry and held up. This wasn't ""thinking outside of the box"" but it wasn't bad by any stretch of the mind. This was, for all intents and purposes, what a cheesecake should be at a minimum, and we liked it.


Atelier Shu - Newmarket - 4.5/10 - $11.00

We wanted to like this more than we did, we know the calibur of goods that Atelier Shu can produce, however, their burnt basque cheesecake was just that, a tad too burnt, where the carbon flavour came through a bit too strong. The cream on top was nice and light, not too sweet as all their offerings are, and the cheesecake itself was very light and nice. It was creamy, the flavour was great, not cheesy but still cheesecake flavoured, fairly moist, and had it not been burnt this could've been easily a 6.5 or a 7. That said, we rate this overall and overall, we wouldn't want this again even if it was to just pick at the cheesecake inside. Maybe stick to their other goods, because we know Atelier Shu can deliver good products, today just wasn't their day.


Bluebells Cakery - Kingsland - 4.5/10 - $59.00 for a whole, $7.38 per slice

This was cheesecake jello, no lie. There was so much gelatin in this, it wiggled more than The Wiggles themselves. That said, the flavour was really nice which is what kind of ""saved"" this cheesecake, if you consider a below average score ""saving"". Honestly, there are probably people that love this style, it's unique, but it's not cheesecake, and it wasn't for us. The cheesecake flavours were there though, they were pronounced, even though this was their passionfruit version. For the price, we'd probably never order this again, but at a party, we might grab a slice.


Bambina - Newmarket - 4/10 - $8.50

The first thing everyone remarked on was the egg flavour here, which, maybe it's intentional, maybe not, either way, that's really the predominant flavour, but it was cheesecake, it tasted like eggy cheesecake. The texture was a mix of dry and moist, as if it had sat out for awhile, but originally was moist, as the center texture was appealing. That said, it really didn't hold up to average unfortunately.


Costco - Westgate - 4/10 - $34.99 for a whole, $4.37 per slice

Costco does a lot of things right, cheesecake, unfortunately, is not really one of those things, though, it almost landed. The texture was right, and it looks aesthetically pleasing on the eyes, however, this marbled chocolate cheesecake was just far too sweet, and the cheesecake tasted like it had cheap white chocolate in the mix, which, was really unappealing to the palate. If they had ditched the white chocolate and used less sugar, this really would've had a chance because the actual cheesecake flavour that came through, was really well done, but too much was out of balance to really rate this even average unfortunately.


Fed Deli - Auckland CBD - 4/10 - $13.50

Disappointment again... The Fed is officially on our ""do not return"" list after this. We're not sure what's going on at The Fed, but the quality all around has slipped majorly. This cheesecake was dense, super dense, so dense we needed water to drink to get through it, and honestly, that's fine, but this was just sweet, and cream cheese, nothing else, no vanilla or lemon or something to give it something more. If it did, it didn't taste like it. The strawberries were from frozen, which is strange because strawberries can now be found in stores for decent price. The cream was not sweetened whatsoever, it just tasted like whipped heavy cream, nothing else. Overall, this was unimpressive, unenjoyable, and just not what we expect from an Al Brown establishment. The reuben, the hotdog, and now this.


Hollywood Bakery - Auckland CBD - 4/10 - $5.50

Laugh as you will with this getting even a 4/10 but believe it or not, this was kinda alright. The cheesecake flavour was there, it wasn't overly sweet, though it was sweet, the bottom wasn't bad, though it wasn't great, it tasted like a biscuit bottom, and the passionfruit topping was balanced actually, albeit, definitely from a jar. That said, we had worse cheesecakes and, in comparison, this actually rates as a 4/10. We'd eat this again if we had to, which is more than we can say for some places we went, and the price is alright!


Le Macaron - Takapuna - 4/10 - $12.20

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. We almost gave this average, however, we all agreed we wouldn't want to eat it again, which really puts it below a five (fives we will eat again!). It was very thin, the burnt flavour same through a bit strong, probably because there wasn't much cheesecake itself to balance it out, and the cheesecake itself was dry and just, lacking any real flavour. It was weird, you ever have that cheap vanilla ice cream from the store, the one that says vanilla but then you eat it and you're just like, this tastes like frozen milk with sugar, it's kind of like that.


ThreeBarFifty - Online and Popups - 4/10 - $13.00

This had so much potential, so much potential, but it fell short for two reasons: This was much too sweet, and much too burnt. The cheesecake itself had a good texture, creamy, a touch gooey, yet thick enough to hold together. The flavour was decent, cream cheese came through, but was a tad one-note, but honestly, that might be because of the burnt top, bottom, and sides. We're all for creme brulee, we LOVE creme brulee, but they burnt this sugar a bit too much, and with the overcooked bottom and top, it just really didn't help this cheesecake get over the line. Additionally, that burnt sweetness, took this far too far in the sweet department to have this really be enjoyable. We had such high hopes, ThreeBarFifty seem like they're really trying to think outside the box, but this needs a touch more work on execution to really be up there with the greats.


Coffee Pen - Eden Terrace - 3.5/10 - $12.50

This was supposed to be an apple caramel cheesecake, and again, like most of the flavoured cheesecakes, this just did not land. First off, the walnut pieces just didn't belong here, it was not the right nut choice, secondly, the caramel layer between the cheesecake and the base was much too sweet and tasted nothing like caramel, more just a semi-liquid sugar sauce that looks like caramel. The apples were actually really nicely spiced and had a good texture, and the cheesecake layer itself was decent, good texture, good cream cheese but also good spice flavour. The base was hard though and altogether, this was imbalanced and just didn't come together cohesively.


Baker & co. - Wai O Taiki Bay - 3/10 - $8.00

This was their brownie cheesecake, which was neither a brownie, nor a cheesecake. This thing, it was so sweet, had some berry flavour bites, but practically no chocolate flavour, and no cheesecake flavour. It tasted like boxed cake mix that was more moist, but three times as sweet.


Circus Circus - Mount Eden - 3/10 - $13.90

This was supposed to be a crunchie bar cheesecake, but instead, it was a mess of texture and weird flavours that really makes us wonder, how is Circus Circus still in business, because we've had nothing but misses from this place. This tasted like a chocolate caramel mousse cake, instead of a cheesecake, and tasted nothing like cheesecake. It was very sweet, it was very unbalanced, and it was not well received by anyone in the group.


Crafty Baker - Titirangi - 3/10 - $9.00

We like to say ""the photos tell the story here"" for a reason, because the photos really tell a story. This was dry, dense, eggy, and the blueberries tasted frozen which, isn't necessarily a bad thing sometimes, but this was just, off, as if they had been freezer burned. Either way, we really didn't enjoy this cheesecake.


Esther at QT - Auckland CBD - 3/10 - $18.00

Note - This comes with chocolate ice cream (not pictured)
This is Esther's basque cheesecake with orange marmalade and let us tell you, this cheesecake was an experience in flavour, but not in the ways you'd think. The aftertaste of this cheesecake tasted like rendered pork fat, and no, we're not kidding. What we think happened here is that they baked this in an oven at some point that was used to bake/make some kind of pork dish, because the flavour was definitely there, and it wasn't just one of us that made this remark. That said, the flavour of this was nice, they definitely nailed the cheesecake portion of this, no burnt flavour, smooth texture, could taste the cream cheese was it wasn't ""cheesy"". The orange topping though, we could've done without it, it was bitter, and added nothing to the cheesecake. This could have stood on its own without the topping. Regardless, we can only rate what we get the day of, and maybe this day was a fluke, but the weird pork flavour threw us for a loop and we just didn't enjoy it.


Little Luscious Cafe - Ellerslie - 2/10 - $7.50

This was Little Luscious's Russian fudge cheesecake, and it was not good. This was just gooey sweet overload that none of us enjoyed whatsoever. The top was like a caramel layer, and the cheesecake itself was a thick goo type texture which we really just didn't understand. The sugar on this was cranked up to absurd levels to the point where it felt like chewing on a butterscotch candy.


Hell Pizza - Flat Bush - 1.5/10 - $6.00

This was not good, we normally try to be nice in our reviews, but we can't here, no one liked this, and we threw half of this out, and we never do that (we hate food waste). This was Hell's ​kahlua and white chocolate cheesecake with a gingernut base and it should've just stayed in Hell, where it belongs. This was overly sweet, really overly sweet, and the white chocolate flavour was extremely unpleasant. The kahlua didn't help here, and the gingerbread bottom just had us confused. These flavours don't work well together and we'd never order this again. We'd be really surprised if anyone actually liked this, how is this on their menu still?


Noughts & Crosses - Mount Eden - 1/10 - $12.75

This was quite possibly one of the worst cheesecakes we ate, and while we don't like to bring places down, especially local places, we've gotta say something here because we rarely give scores of 1/10 as 1/10 is downright inedible, which this was. This was the driest cheesecake we ate, and we're pretty sure it's because this had sat out at least overnight, if not for a couple of days. Now, we get it, baked goods are an overhead of a product, anything thrown out is a ""loss"", however, we also know that profits can never come before quality. This was so dry, and held together so well, we tossed the piece back and forth just to see if it'd stay together and it did, we did this a few times. You can see from the photos, it looks like at one point this was moist, it looks like the bottom and the middle still had a touch of life to it, but everything else tasted like if powder was a flavour. Maybe it was a bad day, maybe this is good normally, however, we were sold this, Noughts & Crosses made a conscious decision to serve this, and we rate what we get. Either way, if this is what is being served, we can't recommend anyone ever coming here.

1gbm8h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1gbm8h1/cropharma_hiring_india/,CRO/Pharma hiring India,"Hi people, 

Since April  I have been  trying to switch my job. Until now I got interview from only  2 CRO's. It went pretty great considering we discussed commute, work hours, leave policy etc, one of the interviewer even mentioned that my experience was aligning with the study they would likely put me in. Later on  after a week I hear back from recruiter that I wasnt selected. I feel like my  90 days of NP is becoming an issue. Not really sure. 

Secondly I have been applying to open positions at Parexel, BMS ,  Sanofi, Syneos, ABBVIE, Fortrea etc but it been over 2 weeks already . I am yet to receive any response. Not sure what the hell is happening. Any of you going through the same ? What is your strategy to receive interview calls atleast ? 

Thirdly,  my current company is very much toxic. Juniors behave so rudely and unprofessionaly. And some of the managers are too much into micromanagement. Its come to a point that even if we decide to go on a lunch or coffee break we need to inform them. 

Please note informing not to the study leads but the Manager who doesnt even take part in the day to day activities we are doing. I dont know how and when will universe help me get out of here. 

  
Lastly, pay disparity. Got to know people with less than three YOE are getting 15X extra than me and are also transitioned into lead roles. Me who has 5 YOE still making half the salary of what people I know in other companies make. 

  
I just need a way out of all these. The 90 days NP, micromanagement, pay disparity everything. I am struggling financially since I will need to help out at home as well as I am the only sole earner. 

Just not seeing anything positive with regards to work life which inturn is also affecting my personal life and whole vibe as well. ",0,1729831098.0,clinicalresearch,0,0.33,False
1gbm7xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gbm7xw/light_paranoia_questioning_peoples_motives_behind/,Light paranoia. Questioning people's motives behind what they tell. Thinking situations aren't right and you have to leave.,"I've started drinking coffee about 10-15 years ago, and I've had this light paranoia ever since. At work, when my boss told me to keep our site clean, I though the boss was lying and covering her behind and did not actually expect me to do it. And at home, I will get invited to family events, and think something isn't right, and that I can't stay overnight with them because I will inconvenience them or somehow the arrangement isn't right.

Before, I used to just take people at face value and believe them, I think. Now, I am sort of on guard and thinking stuff that I wouldn't think otherwise and it is creating problems for me out of nothing.

Also, having this sense and thinking that situations are not okay. For example, feeling shamed and out of place at work like you are too old or disliked there or afraid of being seen because you feel like something isn't right for people to see you. Or that family situations at family events are not right and so you skip them or leave. Avoiding family interactions because feelings like something isn't right. 

Being angry, vengeful and distrustful of people. Being scared of life like it is walls around you like you are Alice in Wonderland. 

It really feels like that web the spider made in the other post. Like cluster of thinking skipped and thoughts going direct past them where you avoid them out of some fear. ",2,1729831040.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Since last week Avinash's ass was itching. He got really worried and asked for a doctor. The doctor examined him and found a strange redness on his ass. He conducted many tests and concluded that it was paan masala. Avinash has been maintaining his distance from Vivian since then 😭😭😭

Vivians arguments have more holes than the ones between his teeth 😭

People say Vivian is a confused guy. They are very very wrong. Vivian has complete clarity of what he needs to do. Please don't expect him to know everything at all times. Just wait for him to get the WKV feedback and then he can decide what's right and what's wrong 😊


They say Vampires are thousands of years old. Now I understand from where he gets his regressive thinking about women 😐

When Vivian got married they used imported coffee from europe instead of Haldi in his haldi ceremony 😵‍💫

BB had planned Vivian vs KV/Avinash for Vivian to show a good rivalry. What Vivian wants is Vivian vs Chahat/Shrutika/Shilpa/Chum/Hema/Jaya/Lata/Sushma etc etc 😎

Vivian has worked on so many tv shows and became a tv superstar. He wanted to become a movie superstar next. So he started doing what he thought all these other superstars were doing. We have to blame Shahrukh, Ajay, Salman, Akshay etc for his gutka addiction 😭


Vivian looks like Ian Somerhalder and Matt Daemon. His coffee comes from Dubai, his tobacco comes from europe, his shoes come from Japan, his wardrobe comes from Australia and when he opens his mouth all you hear is Nalasopara 😭 (no disrespect to Nalasopara though)

I'm part of a local group called ""Outlanders Progressive Bluegrass Social Club"". We're a  501c3, with a goal of supporting the broader genre of acoustic music trough jams, education, and shows. We have 4 weekly jams around the city we put on. However we are looking for a home for a femme only jam so those pickers can feel more comfortable. Though we pride ourselves on being inclusive and younger than say your grandfather's bluegrass club, the fact is Bluegrass,Django Jazz, and Irish music is just super male dominated. So we're looking for a place that will have us on a monthly basis where we can dedicate as a safe femme spot, which will also help newer pickers into the fold.  Here's the criteria:

We need a spot ideally centrally located thats open to hosting one weekday a month to start. But at least Seattle City Limits.  
  
Since the jam won't start till about 7:30, usually bars are our best bet (But open to coffee shops that stay open late) jams usually wrap up by 10:30. However if it usually a loud spot or a sports bar it's not a great spot for musicians since jams are all acoustic. Physically the pickers just need a corner or a dedicated area that can accommodate 8 chairs in a circle. 

If you're a business owner, I'm happy to answer any questions via DM. Jams are great for a business as it's basically free music without having to deal with the rigamarole of setting up a PA or drumset. Patrons love it because they get to enjoy music and also still have a conversation. So it's a win win. 

And if you're just interested in learning more about the club or what ever you can find us at [outlandersbluegrass.org](http://outlandersbluegrass.org) . Thank you all for supporting our scene. ",7,1729830596.0,Seattle,2,0.7,False
1gbm2at,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gbm2at/aita_for_sleeping_in_on_a_family_vacation/,AITA for sleeping in on a family vacation?,"I (25F) recently went on a family vacation that resulted in basically all my cousins cutting ties with me and vise versa. I was invited by a few of my cousins to go to Disney World with them, as was my fiancé. My fiancé and I took the time off from work (unpaid), booked flights, and bought park tickets.

On the first day, the plan was to go to Epcot. I decided to sleep in, and my fiancé kindly stayed back at the resort to wait for me. Once we made it there, I texted a chat with a couple of my cousins, notifying them and requesting we meet up. We never did, though we did all make plans to meet for dinner at 8 pm. However, at 6:55 pm my cousin Brad reached out to me to inform me that they were actually changing dinner to 7 pm. At that point we were in line for a ride. I communicated this. I didn't get a reply and then anxiously added that they could go without us if they wanted. They did. I had been disappointed that we hadn't met the entire day, and was even more disappointed that they decided to move up dinner.

The next day, the plan was to go to magic kingdom. I, again, slept in and got to the park later than everyone else. This time though, we were able to meet up with everyone. However, at some point after getting off a ride, everyone had left without my fiancé and I (even though we were on the same ride and they would've had to wait maybe a single minute for us). This left me extremely annoyed. After some time, I recalled that I had Brad's location and checked it only to find that they had left the park and gone to a bar without us. Hurt, I then created a group chat with all 8 people to explain that I wanted to spend time with everyone and ask that they let me know when they were doing things so that my fiancé and I could join. They were receptive to this, however, the trend soon continued on.

Additionally, we failed to get access to one of the bars we were going to meet them at because the elevator wouldn't take us to the floor and we were also late for a dinner because we let everyone else get ready ahead of us and missed the bus. We were also blamed for a prank that someone was pulling within the suite where a new victim would find a puddle of coffee under their pillow every night. Eventually, I reached out to my cousin Josh, who seemed to be the source of the hostility, to ask if there was an issue. He said our tardiness bothered him and we ended up getting into it a bit with no resolve.

On the last day, they all had dinner without inviting us. Before this I had texted to ask what they were up to. They replied ""Stuck in the rain"". When I pressed further, they doubled down and I took the hint. We left the next day early in the morning to catch our flights and I sent a text saying good-bye, expressing thanks, and wishing everyone a safe trip. A few replied. Things were left on bad terms, I would say. I thought I was over it, but it does keep me up sometimes. To this day, I cannot figure out what went wrong or if I'm to blame.

1gbm1n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNOLA/comments/1gbm1n4/female_solo_traveler_report/,Female solo traveler report! ,"Here is my solo female travel novel! But has great tips and tricks for everyone. I traveled to NOLA Oct 12-16.

I didn't have too many concrete plans because I wasn't sure what course Milton would take. Anything that was not refundable or cost money to reserve I did not purchase in advance. However, since it was just me, this worked. This will be less likely to work if you have multiple people in your party. 

When I got to MSY around 1030AM, I got into a taxi with a lovely man named Carlos (5042052248) and he drove me to Peche. I had their fried oysters and a Little Red Corvette. Excellent start to the day.

I wanted to go to a tarot pop up, so I traveled to Garden District via streetcar. The one day Jazzpass is so cheap ( with military/senior discounts it was just $.80!). I got to Gracious Cafe, purchased a frozen elderberry lemonade and Kouign Amann, and got a tarot reading done with Tarot Hearse. Check her out if you ever want to have a reading done for $30 in a hearse car!

Traveled by street car to my hotel which was a short walk (I had a small carry on suitcase and a crossbody so this was feasible), chilled in room for a while, and then ventured to Atchafalaya via bus. 

Atchafalaya was amazing. Their shrimp and grits, as well as their fried green tomatoes, are foods I want to eat after I die. You know how most shrimp is rubbery and depressing? This shrimp was enormous and just the right texture and taste. GO EAT THEIR SHRIMP AND GRITS. They also make their sorbet in house and dear God I don't think I've tried any sorbet so flavorful.

 I wanted to check out some Magazine St stores and Halloween decor, so I walked...the whole way back to the French Quarter. It was getting dark, but a lot of people were walking their dogs and there were a lot of tourists and people who made dinner reservations around too, and I walk fast, so no one bothered me. 

I feel Magazine St is where alot of locals like to eat. There were a lot of non Cajun/Creole themed restaurants on the street that had a lot of people in them. There are also so many cute shops!

Walked to the Carousel Bar but there were no spots. Decided to get a drink at The Old Absinthe House instead. $20-25 a drink but they were good. 

I was hungry after my 3 mile walk and stopped at Sweet Saint. $7ish for an amazing cup of ice cream. Definitely hit the spot!

Revitalized, I decided to walk on Bourbon. It's crazy. Everyone was out celebrating something. People were on ghost tours. Clubs are blasting music. I would not recommend getting a hotel right on Bourbon if you want any sort of quiet at night. I stayed at the Omni Royal and even from there I could hear intermittent bass. Highly recommend bringing a noise maker.

I explored some more side streets, took some pictures, and saw a procession playing music and dancing. I was understandably tired at this point and retired to my room around 930pm.

DAY 2 Sunday

My toothbrush was moved! I have OCD and notice these things. Omni Royal is one of the haunted stops on the FQ.

Tried to grab a Beignet and coffee from Cafe Beignet, but the line was out the door at both the Royal and Canal street locations. I was somewhat concerned because I took some vitamins that are recommended to take with food. But I thought I was going to be late for my 945 Cemetery 1 tour, so I rushed over there.

 Apparently my phone did not register that I made a 1045 reservation (thanks EST, would recommend checking your reservations if you're coming from another time zone, and bringing a physical watch just in case). So I had some time to double check my other reservations and chow down a chicken salad croissant and frozen coffee at the Basin St hotel location. You can also get on an Hop On Bus here, but they're around $40 for the day.

Would recommend walking here through streets going through the French Quarter. Canal street starts looking rough beyond the FQ. No one outright bothered me, but a few men did make some comments about me as I walked past them on Basin St. 

The cemetery tour was great. I had Mary, whose family has been in New Orleans since the 1700s. I was expecting some sort of smell from the cemetery due to well, the nature of death, but there was none. Those who live around swampy ground have to bury their dead above ground, and there's a natural decomposition process that happens within the graves that turns the corpses to ash. Then the ashes get shoved aside and the next body gets thrown in. Also, got to see Nic Cage's grave. Fun video about Nic Cage if you have some time to watch: https://youtu.be/pn4T0sx5_7M?si=OgBkCVfYW6caFmKT. Also saw Marie Laveau's grave. She helped save one of the ancestors of our tour guide from a sickness! 

I wandered back to the FQ and stopped by Leah's Pralines. A coworker told me how good pralines are around here and I wanted to stop by and get him a gift and try some out for myself. If you're not from the South, give it a try! I will say that Laura's Pralines near the Omni Royal taste better.

Along the way I saw a tour company called Gators and Ghosts. I signed up for a large airboat tour for around $70, with pickup and drop off included.

I stopped by Trashy Diva as well, which has beautiful boutique clothes. Tried on a dress, decided to think about my purchase (I would have to dry clean the dress or hand wash it, and looked like it would wrinkle easily. All deal breakers for me). These are unique pieces you'll invest in, they are not cheap. Don't feel bad about walking out of a store if you need more time to think about purchasing it. It'll still most likely be there tomorrow. 

I stopped my Muriel's the night prior, asking if I could check out the lounge. One of the hostesses told me to come back before 4pm the next day. So I wandered over there. The price was to get a drink at the bar (around $15). I got a Honey Child and relaxed upstairs for a bit. 

My next stop was the Vampyre Boutique. Very overpriced, but I managed to get a card to their speakeasy after purchasing some expensive tea that is as red as blood when you brew it. 

Stopped by Voodoo Authentica, but also overpriced. They had a guy doing readings for people who sounded like a lot of fun. 

Stopped by Fleurty Girl. Cute souvenirs if you're into that. Also Stopped by a T shirt store called Big Easy T Shirts run by a lovely Korean couple, got a gift for my dad. 

Stopped by my hotel to recharge a bit and grabbed a muffeleta from the Rib Room. Food took a while to get to me but it was good. Thr edges were a bit hard and the bartender gave me a discount because of that. Caught the last few songs of the Jazz Band too. 

I went up to my room to refresh and found that the staff left a birthday surprise! So I relaxed in my room and wandered out around 5pm. I stopped by Lush to grab a magnesium massage bar (HIGHLY recommend bringing an oil or buying a bar from Lush and massaging your feet/legs/back at night after showering, so you'll be able to do more exploring the next day!) and The Royal Praline Company and grabbed a few very reasonably priced souvenirs (although sales tax around here is a whopping 10.45%! 😱).

I dropped by my room to drop off my purchases (also highly recommend staying around wherever you'll be spending the most time so you can relax/refresh/drop bags off!). Then I started heading toward my reservation at Commanders Palace. I used the street car to get to the Garden District. While taking the street car, I tied my hair up bc it was windy and hot. When I got out, I put my hair down and a lady yelled out her car at me, ""YEAH BABY WAVE THAT HAIR AROUND!"" NOLA is super chill like that.

Commanders Palace is wonderful and worth the trip. Highly recommend if you're celebrating something special or just want to treat yourself or a loved one. The staff is wonderfully attentive, interactive, and the food is amazing. 10/10 would dine here again. I had their trio soup sampler, a mushroom dish, and their bread pudding meal (which is the same price as an entree). I also got a French 75 with gin, but the waitress got my French 75 and a guy next to me confused, and accidentally gave me his French 75 which had cognac. Thankfully I noticed that mine was darker in color and he was able to have his, but he and his partner already drank mine. The restaurant made me another drink no problem. My meal was incredible. 

I walked over to the Buckner House aka AHS Coven House and took some pictures. Then I waited for the streetcar to take me back. This took a while, but I don't mind walking and just being outside. Where I'm from in MD it's a bit chilly to be outside at night. 

I rode the train car to Canal and walked to a store called Hex. It was one of the few stores still open at this time. It was a lovely store that has various spell ingredients and really kind shop owners. 

I was feeling a little hungry, and felt like having gelato once again. I found a place nearby called Drip Affogato Bar. I walked yet again...but I'm in pretty good shape. I had a flight of 2 affogatos there but couldn't finish them completely. I was tired at this point and went back to my hotel around 1030pm.

DAY 3

Went to French Toast on Decatur St. and ordered their coconut stuffed French Toast. It was massive. I also got an iced coffee. This location also offered a military discount of 10%.

Decided to walk off the calories around Jackson Square. Truly talented artists there! Eveyrone there displaying their art got a license from the city that what is there is THEIRS and not reproductions, so if you're looking for original art, to support local artists, or to find someone to commission for you, this is the place. 

I had to run to the restroom so I stopped by my hotel and popped back out and walked to Lyla Clayre studio. If you love watercolor, I am convinced she is the best watercolor artist in the city! I got an adorable alligator print. They also ship starting at $15 if you're worried about how your print will fare on the trip back. I'm hoping that my two poster boards will shield mine enough...

I popped back into my hotel to drop the print off. Then I started to the French Market Inn to start my journey with Airboat Adventures. I had a little time when I got there so I popped into the Sephora really quick to sample some of their perfumes. 

Corey was an amazing guide. I went on a large group airboat tour. There were some slow parts under low hanging trees, and fast parts where you definitely needed ear protection, which they provide. Although I'd recommend bringing some sort of rubbing alcohol wipe to sanitize it or ask staff if they could clean the headphones for you. I sweat like a mofo with them on.

I signed up via Gators and Ghosts at 728 Saint Louis Street. The guy who registered me for the tours was very nice and gave me great suggestions. This location also has a military discount!

I opted for transportation to and from the location. Easy pick up across the French Market Inn in front of a parking lot. They will call you to make sure you're at the location. The faster you get there, the faster everyone gets on the bus, and the faster you can start your airboat tour. 

Some tips - would advise bringing sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat. The sun's reflecting off the water is bright and hot. No need for bug spray if you're going around 2pm. Would also advise bringing two water bottles and some sort of nausea medication/ginger/mints if you get seasick. Wear long pants if you're doing the uncovered airboats because those seats get HOT.

Got back and checked out Sassy Magick Boutique at 230 Chartres St. Cute store if you're looking for enamel pins and witchy apparel. Little pricey though. 

I was starving and headed to GW Fins. Their claim to fame is their Scalibut, and you won't regret it. It was perfect. I sat at the bar, received amazing service, and the man who sang me Happy Birthday (Kenneth) sounded like an angel.

The day before I received a card from the Vampyre Boutique to their Potions speakeasy at Fritzel's. It was sorta cool trying to find the vampire, who was sitting in a section away from the rest of the bar. He opened the door for me to be led to the speakeasy. It felt a little campy, and the drinks were a little expensive, but I ended up having many conversations there with people, had fun people watching from their balcony, and got a Celtic Cross tarot reading done by their witch Olorin. She gave me a card to -yet another- vampire speakeasy that is above their Apothecary location that opened at midnight. She said they sometimes open earlier so I ventured over to get some food. 

The service at the Apothecary was not that great. I sat down and there was probably something going on because I was waiting for almost 10 min for just water. After reading some reviews, I decided to just leave and went to the Copper Monkey Bar and Grill. The bartender who was working was really nice and the food came out fast and hot. A lot of service workers frequent this restaurant, so you know it's a good place to eat.

At this rate I decided to wander back to my room (GW Fins served me an extra glass of wine on the house for my birthday, and I had a red Absinthe drink and Fangria at Potions) and took a small nap. I still wasn't feeling the best so I decided to retire and try for the other vampire speakeasy the next night. 

DAY 4

I decided today was going to be cemetery and City Park day. I decided to Uber to Sacred Grounds Coffee Shop from my hotel. Solid food and drinks, but they have just small bakery options and were out of a lot of in house drink ingredients when I got there around 10am. They also have a lot of THC stuff around and in their beverages/food, so if you can't have it, double check with the barista. I think they may be struggling a bit because of the lack of ingredients and I also needed to use the restroom and one of the workers there had to run to the employee bathroom to find a used toilet paper roll for me to put into the customer bathroom...

After drinking my drink and eating my pumpkin bread, I walked around Patrick Cemetery #2, and discovered that I was fairly close to Anne Rice's cemetery. I grew up reading her books. I had to cross part of a highway to get there, but it was a fairly quick walk. When I got to her grave, it was nothing short of a religious experience, and I've been out of church for a long time.

Metairie Cemeterey is gorgeous. It's by the highway so you'll hear the drone of cars in the background, and it's not the quietest. While wandering, I chanced upon All Saints Mausoleum, which was an indoor mausoleum with AC. I found that very cool. I was quiet and respectful, found a bathroom, and also a water fountain. 

There wasn't really a safe way to get to City Park on foot from the cemetery, so I ordered an Uber. It didn't register my location in front of the mausoleum, but thankfully I started walking in the right direction of where my Uber was and I was on my way. 

I got dropped off at Cafe Du Monde in City Park. No line, quick fresh beignets, smooth iced Cafe au lait. You can't get just one beignet, so either have someone to share with, or be prepared to eat 3 fried pieces of dough with sugar sprinkled on top. I would say it's worth to try once, but don't worry if you miss out. You can also buy beignet mix all over the city. The cheapest I've found so far have been their company store across from their Riverwalk location and the Royal Praline Company 300 Royal St.

Now it was time for City Park. It's very picturesque, shaded, and relaxing. I spent a good hour here. I wandered over to the sculpture garden of the Art Museum, but went into the museum only to cool off, since it was $15 for military to look around. 

I decided instead to try to make a couple of distillery tours, and hopped onto the 48 light green streetcar to make my way back to Seven Three Distilling. This streetcar had AC on it thank God. I was on both where the windows were open and ones with AC available. I really loved the street cars. Way cheaper than a hop on hop off bus and Ubering. Got to see the city and overhear conversations. Also got some time to relax, edit pictures, and type out all of these notes haha!

Made it to Seven Three Distilling. Check to see if your hotel offers a tour with them. Mine was covered and it was a lot of fun. I had Ashley, who was born and raised in New Orleans, does stand up comedy, and lives on the French Quarter. She's also heavy handed with the communion cup samples 😉 during the tasting, I had a local cheeto like snack called Chee Zees. They're better than Cheetos imo. Helped cushion my stomach from the 9 generous samples I had. This place's frozen Hurricane is also phenomenal. They use real juice in it as opposed to a lot of places in the area that use a powdered mix.

Afterwards, I walked to Curio and had their 4 dish sampler. Then I walked to Rouse's Grocery store and purchased a pack of ginger chews and a couple of bags of Chee Zees. 

I hopped into Osterhold Gallery and Studio that I saw some cool paintings of (one was Interview with a Vampire!) and ordered a shirt and print of Jackson Square.

Then I walked back to my hotel, and along the way I dropped some money into a performers bucket. You won't miss him on the way to the Omni Royal - he's on the corner right across from it, playing a white guitar standing in the back of his truck. When I put money in it, he started singing, ""Thank you lady with the cool ass tattoos~""

At this point I have drunk more in 3 days than I usually do in 3 months and I'm an old lady (in my 30s ok but oh well) and my body was feeling it. I would throw up if someone offered me more alcohol. I rested in my room for a bit, video called my family, and eventually got the energy to walk down to Frenchmen Street. 

The weather was absolutely lovely. Milton sucked out most of the humidity and it was around mid 70s at night. It was revitalizing just being outside. Now I understand why some people want balcony rooms. Next time I come, I think I'll get one. By the time I got to Frenchmen st., I saw that there was a night market and briefly looked around. A girl grabbed my hand and said I was gorgeous. I continued looking around and hopped into a bookstore that was still open. Then I hopped into Bamboulas because they had salad. At this point my body was screaming at me for not having something healthy this day. All I had was fried dough, a Cafe au lait, pumpkin bread, lavender London Fog, and the sampler and alligator sausage I had at Curio. Alcohol, bread, salt. And Bamboulas's kitchen was still open and I got myself a large ass house salad. 

A band was setting up and they sounded good but a lot of the live music is very loud. If that's your goal, I'd bring earplugs and plenty of cash for cover charges, also tipping the band (although a lot have Venmo and other electronic forms of payment so no worries here).

Revitalized after being a responsible adult taking care of my flesh prison, I walked back to the Apothecary. There is a cool speakeasy in the attic. Cool place to hang out with a seance room, although a little warm. I think a lot of people thought to come around midnight since that's what the card says, so when I, the old lady, showed up around 930, it was pretty dead, no pun intended. 

At this point my body couldn't take any more drinking so I asked for a mocktail menu. Don't be ashamed to ask for one, at least at the Apothecary. They are delicious! I got an Eye of the Storm. Listening to your body is important. You might feel pressure from how party crazy the city is, as well as from people you're around, but rather order a mocktail than have to nurse an upset stomach and hangover the next day.

I had a tea reading with Nancy, and she was nice, but a little weird. She didn't understand social cues well and I didn't connect with her very well, but she did say my husband was a squirrel, so that and how delicious the tea was was worth the $20.

Went back to my room, packed, and slept. Although I feel I may have invited too many spirits to me throughout my trip, and slept with a small light on. 

I didn't have much cash to tip the staff, so I stripped everything for them and left the trash cans next to the towels and bed linens I used. But I also didn't ask for room service. If you're planning on using room service every day you're there, plan to tip around $5-10 each day.

Ate breakfast downstairs (Banana Foster French Toast!), got into an Uber with the sleaziest Uber driver I've ever ordered because the taxi I called was unavailable, and got to the airport early. I wanted to explore and I was also paranoid with my phone showing times in CST and EST. Next time I cross time zones I'm bringing a physical watch just in case. 

There is plenty of overpriced food at the airport if you'd like to eat lunch. No pressure to rush to the airport through mid day traffic. If you want to buy gifts, I think the common NOLA souvenir shops are fine, but if you see pop ups like Dirty Coast, look on their website instead. A shirt I wanted was around $10 more at the airport than it was online. Fleurty Girls prices are the same online and at the airport though. If you have Priority Pass, there are I think 3 clubs you can go to. I was flying Southwest and had access to a club, and had a light complimentary meal and drink while there. 

A few tips and tricks being in New Orleans: 

-Wear flat shoes. The roads and sidewalks are incredibly uneven, and the carriage and police horses piss and shit on the streets. People also vomit on the streets on and around Bourbon, so bring close toe shoes if you can. You will break your ankle if you try to wear anything other than flat shoes. Bring at least one pair of sneakers, and I recommend these shoes for the ladies, they are my favorites! I have two pairs because I love them so much: https://a.co/d/3jqfibp. Patented leather will save a lot of work. 

-Get refundable everything. I chose SW because they have an option to have your fare be either refundable or applied to a future SW flight without expiration up until right before your flight. Also do the same with your hotel and whatever other reservations you're able to do so with. Better to spend a little more and have peace of mind than to go cheap and not be able to get any money back. 

-Watch where the sun goes. Depending on the time of day, the sun will hit you less on one side of the road compared to the other. Important for avoiding heatstroke. 

-Cross with confidence and cross with other people when you can. You'll annoy the drivers less if you do that. Also crossing in groups is the safest thing you can do there. Sometimes the lights get wonky...

-Always drink at least a cup of water wherever you go. If you head back to your hotel for a break, get water from the lobby water stands or go to the front desk and ask for bottles of water if your hotel provide them.

-Keep special cards for tipping your tour guides (they usually have their venmo on cards), coupons you get, some cash in the sleeve of your hotel card, so you won't lose them. I found my share of peoples' hotel key cards while walking around the city, but the hotels were too far for me to return them (all the way near the airport).

-If you walk with purpose people will usually leave you alone. I grew up in Seoul and DC and have a 6' husband. I walk fast and no one asked me about my shoes and people didn't really ask for money either. But I'm also prior military and probably look intimidating when I'm walking sometimes. There were times I could tell when an area got a little rougher or there was someone troublesome up ahead. I looked for people to walk with and blend in to stay with a crowd in those situations. Don't be afraid to ask someone really quickly, ""Hey could I walk with you?"" if you're feeling uncomfortable. 

-If you wear makeup, bring powder makeup and a good setting spray. Everything else will melt right off. Sunscreen makes a good base for makeup. 

-You don't really need to bring a jacket or multi apply sunscreen or bring a hat. Just follow the shade and dip into buildings and you'll be fine if you're not planning on being outside all day. But if you're planning on going to the zoo or an airboat tour, definitely bring sunscreen/hat/etc.

-Only withdraw as much cash as you foresee yourself needing that day. The ATM isn't going anywhere. People accept electronic payments with no issues. Some restaurants will charge you like $1 more if you pay with card, but if you have a good restaurant eating out card and get points then it's worth it to pay with it.

-Bring a lip balm with SPF in it. 

-Pace yourself. It's hot. Eat sample/appetizers, smaller portions, throughout the day. The food is heavy. You will need to nap or walk a ridiculous amount to not need to nap. New Orleans is to be savored. I can easily see myself bringing family back and coming back at least 2 more times. 

-If your hotel has a pool, bring a swimsuit to enjoy it on the hotter days.

-Travel with a battery for your phone. 

-Bring dry shampoo and deodorant. Ladies, I would also recommend small panty liners.

-Just dress normal. Unless you want to be treated like a tourist, then feel free to put beads on yourself and dress in New Orleans shirts. 

-Have at least one fancy outfit to wear to nicer restaurants. Most places don't have a dress code, but double check on their website or call them just in case. Many nicer hotels provide dry cleaning services, and there are plenty of places around the city for you to grab a fancy outfit if you need one. 

-Bring extra underwear and socks to freshen up. If you wear a bra, bring 1-2 extra bras.

-1-2 Liquid IVs a day. You'll thank me later. Costco sells them for a good price. You're sweating and drinking enough to need them. Btw White Peach sugar free is awful, do not get that flavor.

-If you're military, don't be afraid to ask for military discounts even at the fancy places. But a lot of places only give you the discount if you're in uniform, and it's usually around 10%, so you're barely just getting tax taken off. However, many hotels in the area offer a government/military rate, which is nice. 

-If you like to shop, bring either an extra big bag, or an extra duffel bag, stuff your dirty clothes into it, and check that bag in, while you keep your carry on full of gifts and essentials. 

-Bring a bag big enough to put a bottle of water, sunscreen, etc into on your more adventure filled days. Otherwise a small crossbody or just your pockets are fine. On the days I flew in and left, I wore cargo pants/compression pants and socks to help with swelling from the pressure changes and walking a lot. Otherwise, I wore normal clothes like long jeans, dresses, and shorts. 

-If you're traveling solo: use a bathroom before you get any drinks or order, or ask for them to bring you your drinks after you order and use the bathroom. Do not let a drink out of your sight. Bring hand sanitizer to help clean your hands so you don't have to get up after they set your food and drinks down. 

I felt very safe in NOLA overall. I walked miles at night both in and out of the French Quarter and felt like the people and the city had my back. There are many police officers in the area now, although I heard they're there to prepare for the Taylor Swift concert and the Superbowl. 

Overall, I left part of my heart in NOLA. It's a place that welcomes all with open arms with no judgment. The city fed me almost as well as my husband does haha, he has some serious competition now! I plan on going again with my husband and since he likes tours and museums, and I'll tour more of those with him next time. Also shout out to him for solo watching our twins as I enjoyed my birthday trip!

The reason I asking is because I am curious. That time I book in advance quite a lot of lesson which this instructor told me to do so and it cost 800 plus. In the end I did not attend most of his lesson because it does not improve of my driving skill at all. The way he teaching, always reduce my learning duration like going to toilet or buying food from coffee shop. Even when during driving he always repeats his grandpa story which not totally related from my learning.

I believe his number is not contractable. Because I heard rumours, he keeps change phone number. I just wanna know, he still teaching class 3A or already retired or he already rip
