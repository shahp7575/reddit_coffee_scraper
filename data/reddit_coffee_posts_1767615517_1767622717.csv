I think it might be the robusta flavor that I like and of course the extra caffeine is an added bonus. I have a TK-02 and when I use it for drip coffee most of the beans I've tried taste kind of watered down to me. I tried Death Wish medium roast and that has been my favorite so far although I think I would like the dark or espresso roast even more, afraid to try as the beans might be too oily though? If it's not safe, I've read that maybe fresher beans might be an option but I'm very new to this game and not sure where to look.",1,1767622540.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

In the link above you will find photos, timestamp, and a video. 

The Londinium Vectis is an amazingly compact Spring Lever espresso machine. It can steam and Brew at the same time like a dual boiler, does not suffer from overheating like typical heat exchanger machines (thanks to he dipper system), is heated fully in about 15 minutes, and has HUGE steam power. If you like milk drinks and basic 2:1 espresso shots or ristrettos, this is the machine to get. 

I have upgraded the pressurestat to the newer, more robust, model set at 1 bar. It also has upgraded greaseless seals in the grouphead for easier maintenance. Included is a spare grouphead gasket, vacuum valve, and the needed boiler refill funnel. 

This machine was produced in late 2024. I have the original box, factory paper, and packing material. 

I purchased the machine primarily to use on my small coffee cart. The only flaw keeping it from being perfect is that the boiler refill process takes some time when it is already warmed up, due to the need to purge all steam from the boiler. This takes about 5-8 minutes before it is ready, and that's too long for my needs. 

I will ship for $1900, which is about $500 cheaper than a brand new Vectis from Londinium without the upgrades and spare parts.

I rarely hit the brunch spots in my own neighborhood, but I walk by them all the damn time, and lately I've been feeling like I'm missing out.  This was a fine omelet, fluffy and creamy, leagues beyond what I've had at Grey Dog.  Roasted potatoes were on point, hollandaise homemade.  Nice little spot and I'll come back.  I forgot they give you postcards at places like this.

[Court Street Grocers](https://www.courtstreetgrocers.com/)

Their turkey reuben, with swiss, kraut, and ""comeback sauce"" (whatever that is) on Orwashers bread.  Not cheap, since it's Court Street Grocers, but it's undeniable that they make a darn fine sandwich and it's a nice occasional treat.  I'm glad that they've fully bounced back from the dip they were in during the pandemic.

[Menkoi Sato](https://www.yelp.com/biz/menkoi-sato-new-york-2)

RIP for now, but [hopefully reopening soon](https://i.imgur.com/vKRQYvQ.jpeg)!  I'd frequently had their ramen and fried rice before, but this was the first time I had the karaage (Hokkaido-style fried chicken) and holy crap.  Possibly the best fried chicken I've ever had.  It came with a sauce that was a sort of sweet-soy-sesame-maybe-ginger kind of thing that seemed to mirror the chicken itself.  Delicious and the first thing I'll get if/when they rise from the ashes.  Watch [their Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/menkoisato_nyc_v3/?hl=en) for updates.

[Carmela](https://www.carmelacoffee.com/)

Newer place at 8th and 5th, apparently it's the lone outpost of a regional Florida chain.  Poached egg was a leetle overdone, and that wooden board was definitely not optimal for something with crumbs.  Not bad, though.  Place was roomy, with Wi-FI, seemed a touch impersonal and geared toward office folks.  I wouldn't have a problem setting down here and working for a while.

[Olive's](https://olivesnyc.com/)

I started out lukewarm on Olive's but it's been growing on me a bit.  The food isn't anything mindblowing, but the quality is there, and if you can get a seat it's great for people-watching in SoHo.  The soup that day was split pea and ham, and I had that with half an Olive's Hero (coppa, Genoa salami, provolone, olive tapenade, marinated onions, romaine on sourdough).  Solid stuff if you don't mind paying the SoHo premium.

[Kerber's Farm](https://kerbersfarm.com/)

I come here for the cheddar buttermilk biscuits and you should too.  They use them for your standard breakfast sandwiches, and they'll toast them if you want, but I like them plain, just nuked a bit.  They also have a ton of pies, including savory ones, like a chicken pot pie and a mac & cheese pie.  And a vegan one.  I like that I can often find a seat here when the coffee shops are packed, and I'm sure that's partly because they have a ton of seats and partly because their heat in the winter isn't the best.

[Absolute Coffee](https://www.absolutecoffee.nyc/)

Same fantastic coffee as at their OG Brooklyn location, Wi-Fi, and a nice view of Bleecker Street.  I recommend this place as much for that as for the coffee itself.  They showed up here last year and they seem to be successful, for which I'm glad, because WV rents are fucking brutal; they're why Menkoi Sato had to close.  They're not oozing with style/decor like some coffee shops, but they're one of my favorite spots in the WV to chill or get a little work done.  ",1,1767622075.0,FoodNYC,0,0.67,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

The fact that most meaningful work is boring as hell. Writing that proposal, studying for exams, organizing spreadsheets, doing your taxes, none of this shit lights up your dopamine receptors like TikTok or video games. But here's the thing: all the successful people I studied, all the research I dug through from neuroscience podcasts and behavioral psychology books, they all point to one truth. Your brain isn't broken. It's just wired for survival, not spreadsheets. The good news? You can hack it.



I spent months researching this because I was stuck in the same loop. I'd sit down to work, and within five minutes, I'd be scrolling Twitter or reorganizing my desk for the third time. Then I found patterns in neuroscience research and books by people like Andrew Huberman and James Clear. Turns out, making boring work feel good isn't about willpower. It's about rewiring your reward system.



 Step 1: Dopamine Detox (Reset Your Reward Baseline)



Your brain is addicted to cheap dopamine. Social media, junk food, porn, endless scrolling, all of it gives you instant hits without effort. When you try to do boring work, your brain's like, ""Why would I do this when I can get a hit from my phone in two seconds?""



You need to reset your dopamine baseline. This means cutting out high-stimulation activities for a period of time so boring work doesn't feel so painful by comparison. Try a 24-hour dopamine detox where you avoid:



 Social media

 Video games

 YouTube/Netflix

 Junk food

 Music (yeah, even music)



Sounds extreme? It is. But after a day of low stimulation, your brain will actually crave something to do. Suddenly, that boring work project doesn't seem so bad. Your threshold for what feels rewarding drops, and normal tasks start feeling satisfying.



Dr. Andrew Huberman talks about this on his podcast all the time. When you constantly spike your dopamine, everything else feels like a letdown. Lower the spikes, raise the baseline.



 Step 2: Temptation Bundling (Pair Pain with Pleasure)



This technique comes from behavioral economist Katherine Milkman. The idea is simple: pair something you hate with something you love. Your brain starts associating the boring task with the reward, and over time, you'll actually crave the boring work because it comes with the good stuff.



Examples:



 Only listen to your favorite podcast while doing data entry or cleaning

 Drink your favorite coffee only during deep work sessions

 Watch a specific show only while on the treadmill or doing cardwork



The key is exclusivity. Don't let yourself have the reward unless you're doing the boring task. Eventually, your brain will start craving the boring work because it knows the reward is coming.



I started doing this with my morning writing sessions. I only let myself drink this expensive cold brew I love while writing. Now, my brain actually looks forward to writing because it knows that coffee is coming.



 Step 3: Monk Mode Sprints (Make It a Game)



Boring work feels endless. That's the problem. When you think, ""I need to work on this for three hours,"" your brain shuts down before you even start. Instead, use Monk Mode Sprints, short, intense bursts where you go full tunnel vision.



Set a timer for 25 minutes (Pomodoro style). During that time:



 Phone off, in another room

 No music, no distractions

 One task only

 Full focus like your life depends on it



After 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break. Walk around, stretch, get water. Then do another sprint. The magic happens when you track your sprints. Use an app like Forest or Focusmate to gamify it. Seeing your streak of completed sprints triggers your brain's achievement system.



Suddenly, boring work becomes a challenge, a game you're trying to win. I use a simple tally system in a notebook. Every completed sprint gets a checkmark. Watching those checkmarks pile up? Insanely satisfying.



 Step 4: Pre-Commitment Devices (Remove the Escape Routes)



Your brain is a sneaky bastard. It will always choose the path of least resistance. So you need to remove the escape routes before you start working. This is called a pre-commitment device.



Examples:



 Use Cold Turkey or Freedom to block distracting websites before you start

 Leave your phone in a locked drawer or give it to someone else

 Work in a library or coffee shop where you can't slack off without looking like an idiot

 Use Beeminder or Stickk to put money on the line (if you don't finish your task, you lose actual cash)



The app Focusmate is incredible for this. You get paired with a stranger on video for a 50-minute work session. You can't bail because someone's literally watching you work. It sounds weird, but it works. Your brain won't let you procrastinate when someone else is in the room.



There's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized podcasts and adaptive learning plans tailored to your specific goals. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it pulls from high-quality sources like books, research papers, and expert interviews to generate content that actually matches your learning style. You can customize everything, from length (quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives) to voice and tone. The adaptive learning plan evolves with your progress, making it easier to stay consistent. It's especially useful if you're trying to learn skills that feel tedious at first but matter long-term.



The Finch app is also solid for building consistency. It's like a Tamagotchi for your habits. You take care of a little bird by completing tasks. Stupid? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely.



 Step 5: Reframe the Narrative (Change the Story You Tell Yourself)



This is psychological warfare with your own brain. The story you tell yourself about boring work determines how you feel about it. Most people say, ""This is so boring,"" or ""I hate this,"" which makes it worse.



Instead, reframe it as training, as building discipline, as leveling up. You're not just doing boring work. You're strengthening your focus muscle. You're proving to yourself that you can do hard things.



Read Atomic Habits by James Clear if you haven't already. Clear breaks down identity-based habits, how you need to see yourself as the type of person who does the work, not someone who's struggling against it. When you shift from ""I have to do this"" to ""I'm the type of person who does this,"" everything changes.



This book is insanely good. Clear's a Stanford researcher turned habit expert, and this book has sold over 10 million copies for a reason. It will make you question everything you think you know about motivation and discipline. Every page has actionable shit you can use today.



 Step 6: Micro Rewards (Trigger Dopamine Manually)



Your brain needs feedback loops. Boring work doesn't give you instant feedback, so you need to create it artificially. After every small win, give yourself a micro reward.



Finished one section of that report? Stand up, do a victory pose, literally say ""Let's go"" out loud. It sounds stupid, but celebrating small wins triggers dopamine release. Your brain starts associating progress with good feelings.



Keep a ""Done List"" instead of a to-do list. Write down everything you accomplish, no matter how small. Checking things off? Dopamine. Seeing a list of completed tasks? More dopamine. You're training your brain to crave completion.



I also use physical tokens. Every time I finish a deep work sprint, I move a coin from one jar to another. Watching that jar fill up? Ridiculous but effective.



 Step 7: Increase the Stakes (Make It Matter)



Boring work feels pointless because the consequences are distant. You need to bring the consequences closer. Make the pain of not doing it immediate and the reward of doing it tangible.



Use Stickk or Beeminder to put money on the line. Miss your goal? You lose $50 to a charity you hate. Suddenly, that boring work matters a lot more.



Tell people what you're working on. Post your goals publicly. When other people know what you're supposed to be doing, the social pressure forces you to follow through. Accountability kills procrastination.



Get a body double. Work alongside someone, even if you're working on different things. Apps like Focusmate or Ash (a mental health and productivity coach app) connect you with people for accountability sessions. Just having another human in the space makes boring work less painful.



 Step 8: Make It Physical (Move Your Damn Body)



Your brain and body are connected. When you're sitting still, staring at a screen, your brain interprets that as low-energy mode. It doesn't want to engage.



Before starting boring work, move your body. Do 50 jumping jacks, go for a 10-minute walk, do some pushups. Get your heart rate up. This floods your brain with norepinephrine and dopamine, which makes focus easier.



Dr. Huberman's research shows that even five minutes of movement before focused work can increase your ability to concentrate by up to 40%. That's massive.



I started doing this before every work session. Five minutes of movement, then straight into work. The difference is night and day.



 Step 9: Environment Design (Make Boring Work the Path of Least Resistance)



Your environment controls your behavior more than willpower ever will. If your phone is next to you, you'll pick it up. If Netflix is one click away, you'll watch it. Design your environment so boring work is the easiest option.



 Keep your workspace clean and boring (no distractions in sight)

 Put your phone in another room before you start

 Log out of social media on your computer

 Use separate devices for work and entertainment if possible



I keep a ""deep work laptop"" that has nothing on it except work apps. No social media logins, no games, nothing. When I open that laptop, my brain knows it's work time.



 Step 10: Embrace the Suck (Stop Waiting for Motivation)



Here's the hardest truth: motivation is bullshit. You're never going to ""feel like"" doing boring work. The people who succeed aren't more motivated. They just do it anyway.



Stop waiting for inspiration. Stop waiting to feel ready. You'll never feel ready. Successful people feel the same resistance you do. They just start anyway.



Read The War of Art by Steven Pressfield. It's a short, brutal book about resistance and why we avoid doing meaningful work. Pressfield's a legendary screenwriter, and this book will punch you in the face with truth. It's the best book on overcoming creative resistance I've ever read.



Discomfort is part of the deal. Get comfortable with it. The more you practice sitting with boredom and doing it anyway, the easier it gets.

Last Saturday we were set up in a pet store with 6 dogs in pens, a little table with applications, and our usual routine: meet the dog, chat with the foster or handler, fill out the form, we do a quick check, then schedule pickup if everything looks good. About an hour in, this woman comes in with two kids and a big iced coffee, bee lines straight to the sweetest dog we had (a calm older mutt named Daisy who basically leans into anyone with hands). The kids are squealing, Daisy is wagging, it’s cute for about 30 seconds. Then the woman looks at me and goes, ""We’ll take her. Like, now."" I smile and do my little spiel about the application, the adoption fee, and that Daisy is currently in a foster home so we don’t do same day handoffs. Her face changes instantly and she goes, ""No. I’m not doing paperwork for a dog. I have kids. I don’t have time for that."" I tell her gently that everyone does the same process, it’s for the dog’s safety, and it usually takes 10-15 minutes. She starts raising her voice, saying we’re ""gatekeeping"" and that Daisy is ""obviously meant"" for her daughter. Then she points at the pens and asks why those people over there are ""taking so long"" and says we should let her skip because her kids are getting bored. When I repeat the policy, she tries a new angle: ""Fine. Put her on hold. We’re going to Target and then lunch, we’ll come back."" I thought she meant she was kidding, but she actually turns to her kids and says, ""Tell Daisy bye for now, mommy reserved her."" I had to say, out loud, ""Ma’am, we can’t reserve a dog because you want to go shopping."" She gets angry, accuses me of being rude to her kids, and says she’s going to call the store manager because ""you can’t run a business like this."" I told her we’re not a store, we’re a rescue, and Daisy will go to the best fit family, not whoever demands her first. She stormed off and on the way out loudly told another adopter, ""Don’t bother, they’re playing favorites."" The wild part is she came back 2 hours later and acted shocked Daisy was already pending with a family who actually filled out the form. Then she asked if we had ""another Daisy in the back"" like we keep spare dogs  ready for her.

1q4mg95,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EliSimpsonWrites/comments/1q4mg95/the_renseth_legacy_breath/,The Renseth Legacy: Breath,"Simon Renseth would prefer to keep his balls warm, thank you very much. Wind whipped at the thin scarf around his neck, its red color like an ugly scar in the white landscape. Snow swirled about. Cold burned Simon's throat. Why Cornelius thought a trip to the highest mountain in Gerania was a good idea, he'd never know, but the old man seemed to be suffering as much as he. He was shivering, his beard half frozen.

""Can't use magic to solve all our problems, now can we?"" Cornelius had rasped when suggesting this trip. Asshole. Seriously. It was the best moniker he could come up with. Ever since he'd accepted the old—nah, scratch that—impossibly ancient man's invitation to study magic, he'd been subjected to a series of situations that just plain sucked.

For example, yesterday, Cornelius had locked him in an hourglass of sand and ordered, ""Escape."" He had pounded on the smooth curves of the bottom half, sand slowly dripping from above. It got in his hair, between his ass cheeks, everywhere. Most uncomfortable. He'd almost drowned in that damn silica when he'd suddenly found himself outside the hourglass, sand still clinging to him terribly. Cornelius was a monster.

""Asshole,"" Simon coughed bitterly. Seriously, why couldn't he figure out a spell to warm himself up?

""Catching on yet?"" Cornelius questioned from beside him. Simon turned to stare at the man. He wore that same leather vest and cream-colored shirt from their first meeting, complete with black slacks, and, of all things, sandals. He was no longer shaking from the chill, Simon noticed. Nor was his beard frozen; instead, it danced wildly in the wind. Indeed, he seemed almost as if this were a day at the beach.

""How... What... BUT YOU SAID NO MAGIC!""

Cornelius chortled. ""I said we can't use magic to solve all our problems, not that it couldn't be used. Magic should be used when needed, as a tool, secondary to what our instincts tell us to do. There's a cave about a mile further from here. Gawain should be there already with a fire and food. Find me there, young one.""

With that, the man faded from sight, presumably to the warmth of the cave.

Simon gritted his teeth, feeling a sharp pain in one of his back teeth. He'd fallen 20 feet from a clifftop trying to fly and had hit the ground rather hard, breaking the tooth. What was next, a lost limb from frostbite?

He shook his head and took a deep breath. It chilled him, deep down in his belly. He focused on the pulse that was gentle in the back of his mind. That was Cornelius, his anchor in magic until his familiar manifested. It was soothing, oddly. The old man was a snarky, outdated asshole, but the bond revealed a pride for Simon that he wouldn't have believed otherwise.

Simon closed his eyes. He took another deep breath. The cold in his stomach sat heavy. He meditated on it. How had Cornelius been so comfortable? Perhaps he ignored the air around him, the crunchy softness beneath him, the biting temperature? No, no way. That didn't explain the beard. His beard had been frozen. Simon was absolutely certain.

Another breath in, and Simon felt the heat as he breathed out. He wasn't frozen yet, damn it! He dragged his feet through the snow, following the bond, using his breathing as rhythm. In, step, out, step, in, step, out, step.

The mile took an hour. Simon sat with his thoughts. He was cold. He was hungry. He was getting pretty fucking angry. But. He could do this. Each step was one closer to warmth, food, and relief. He stopped shivering. He breathed cold in, and he released heat out.

When he felt solid stone beneath him, Simon finally allowed himself to open his eyes. The cave entrance had a peculiar smell, a mix of sulfur, heat, and rust. Icicles dripped from the ceiling. Warmer air hung here.

He took all this in while staring at the impossible before him: a door. A wooden door. So, this wasn't just some random place that Cornelius had chosen. There was another purpose here. Should he knock?

""Just open the damn door, child,"" Cornelius chided from behind it.

Seriously, he was an asshole.

Simon pushed the door open. Heat blasted him. The smell that lingered in the cave entrance was exponentially stronger here. He stepped into a... workshop? Tools littered the place. Workbenches sat haphazardly against walls, papers and pens and books just anywhere. Gawain, the little magic flute, was dormant, lying near a fireplace carved into the stone of the cave.

""This is where I have lived, dear boy, for the better part of three centuries."" Cornelius' arms were open, welcoming. The smile on his face was that of a proud owner. ""This is where your training will continue. I am sorry for the things I've had to put you through. They were necessary. Tell me how you made it here. Explain to me the process.""

Simon stared at the man before him. There was something different in his voice. Affection, maybe?

""I can't really explain it. I just... breathed.""

Cornelius beamed. ""Excellent! Exactly! Perfect! Finally. Yes, I suspected you were close.""

""Close?""

""Magic is about breath. You only escaped the hourglass yesterday as you gave in to death. I know. I saw it happening, but that act gave you the impulse to breathe. Every task I have set before you was to teach you learning to slow down, calm yourself, and control yourself.""

Simon's brow furrowed as he bellowed, ""You could have just told me that. Asshole.""

The old man just chuckled. ""I could have, and you would have learned nothing. Now, you've learned to breathe. Let's teach you magic!""

Gawain sounded indignantly from beside the fireplace, four angry notes, a fully diminished seventh chord if Simon recalled his piano lessons correctly.

""Gawain is right! Food first. There's a bowl of stew and a cup of coffee on the table for you. Eat. You will need it.""

Simon sat, dipped the spoon into the soup, and took a bite. What had he gotten himself into?",1,1767621723.0,u_EliSimpsonWrites,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Yesterday (Jan 4, 2026) I was on a flight from Warsaw to Košice and I sat next to an incredibly lovely girl. I didn’t approach her during the flight because I didn’t want to make things awkward for her — it's not possible to change seats on a plane and I wanted to respect her space. I wanted to speak to her after we landed, but by the time I collected my bags and disembarked she was already gone.

She looked like she is from India, had long hair, wore black-framed glasses and a black coat. I had the impression she might be a medical student (Košice has a lot of students and fewer exotic tourists). I’d really like to invite her for coffee if anyone knows who she is or has any hint that could help me reconnect.

If you know her, please DM me — I’ll be very respectful of her privacy. Thanks so much for any help!

People congratulated me like I’d won something. My family keeps telling me they’re proud, my coworkers call it a fresh start, and when I post a picture of a coffee shop or a skyline, people reply like I’m living the dream. The problem is I feel like I left my actual life behind and traded it for a highlight reel I can’t even enjoy. Back where I lived before, my days were small and predictable and honestly kind of plain. Same grocery store, same route to work, the little park where I’d walk after dinner, the old lady next door who’d wave from her balcony. I had two close friends there, not a big circle, but the kind where you can text “I’m having a rough day” and they’ll show up with snacks without making it a whole event. Here, everything is louder and shinier and I feel like a visitor in my own routine. I don’t know where anything is without checking my phone. I don’t have places that feel like mine yet. I’m friendly with people at work but it’s all surface, like I’m always performing a version of myself that’s easy to consume. When I get home, the silence feels different than it used to, less peaceful and more like I’m waiting for something. I catch myself missing stupid things, like the smell of the stairwell in my old building, the way the cashier knew I always forgot my reusable bag, even the annoying squeak of my old fridge. I feel pathetic admitting that because I chose this, and I should be grateful. The worst part is I keep lying in small ways. When people ask if I love it here, I say “yeah, it’s great, still settling in” and then change the topic. I don’t want to sound ungrateful or dramatic, and I don’t want anyone to think I made a mistake, especially because this move cost me a lot emotionally. Some nights I scroll photos of my old neighborhood like it’s an ex, and I hate myself for it. I don’t even know what I’m confessing exactly, maybe just that I miss the version of me who felt grounded, and I’m scared that version is gone and I’m stuck faking excitement forever.

Hi everyone! I'm a siphon coffee enthusiast, been brewing with my hario 3 cup for about 8 months now and I'm in love with this thing. I've tried both cloth and metal filters, and prefer cloth with a 2:30s brew time at 1:15 ratio. Clean cup, ritualistic process, science experimenty feeling. Yeah the cleanup is a pain, but I find that charming in its own way. 

My friends know me as ""the coffee guy,"" someone who really loves the siphon. During Christmas, I was gifted with 20 cloth filters. Twenty. While I appreciate the gift and the sentiment, I'm currently at a loss as to what to do with them haha. My cloth filter that came straight out of the box isn't even dirty enough to be replaced just yet, so I'm scratching my head here.

So here am at reddit, looking for some ideas as to what to do with these excess filters. I love tinkering with the siphon, so please by all means if anyone here has a funny or interesting idea, please drop a comment!

Some things I've done:
1. Double cloth filter, like two layers of cloth.

I started ignoring him, and eventually passed his care to another PCA and let the charge nurse know that the patient had made me uncomfortable. Well, the patient noticed that I had stopped going into his room and decided to start complaining about me, stating to the charge nurse that I was unprofessional. He escalated it to our house officer and he told our house officer that 
1) I had put laxatives in his coffee (I did not, I don’t have access to laxitives.) 2) I had become extremely angry at him over playing Drake (I did not, I said ‘Boo! Drake sucks!’ Jokingly.) and 3) that I had accepted a bribe from a patients family member (I did not, I had been offered a tip which I denied.) 

I spoke to the house officer and I informed her what had happened earlier in the night with the sexual harassment. She asked me if I had accepted the bribe. I told her I did not. I spoke to my supervisor this morning, she asked me if I had accepted the bribe. I informed her that I did not. My supervisor told me she will be speaking to the family member to clear things up. 

Here’s where things get more complicated; this family is one of those bradacious, “I’m a big baller” types. He had bragged to me that he had been tipping EVERYBODY, which I know isn’t true. He told me he was a “big boss” and he “drops bills.” I’m worried that when my supervisor speaks to him, he’ll brag about tipping me, and that she’ll believe him, because what are the chances we have two lying patients in one night? 

I have no previous write ups or issues with patients. I’ve been working this job for a year. My supervisor likes me. I have been telling the truth. Could I get fired over this, if she believes the family member?

Finishing this room is a work in progress...and progress is halted until a good thaw comes around again on the guitar.

But sitting in front of the deep coals while I sip my morning coffee is a daily chore I've come to appreciate.

Sometimes a fireplace is exactly the thing that is needed in the moment.

The room heats up FAST with the door open while it would steadily cool down with doors shut. Do your own thing. Never leave an open flame or coals unattended. I burn only well-seasoned oak so no sparks or zingers, but I still don't take chances.

Make sure not to use negative pressure appliances if the door is open...kitchen exhaust, clothes dryer, bathroom exhaust, etc.

After 60-90 minutes of ""Nurse burning"" the coals, they are burnt down low enough to take some out or to spread them out and reload the stove with splits.

This morning 70-degree differentials, -5 outside, 65 inside after overnight. Wood stovin' is the life for me; has been since 1984.

P.S. After this 'nurse burn' I dip a paper towel in the water in the pan on the stove, wipe up some ashes with it and clean the glass.... about every other to every 3 days, I do that bit. It takes less than a minute.",14,1767621218.0,woodstoving,1,0.94,False

1q4m82h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q4m82h/im_anxious_of_being_seen_clearly_and_judged_so_i/,"I’m anxious of being seen clearly and judged, so I try to control how people perceive me and it’s exhausting","I’ve noticed a pattern lately that’s making me uncomfortable, and I’m not sure if I’m being realistic or just paranoid.

People in my life are *really* kind to me: rides home, bringing me coffee/food, helping me when I lose stuff, getting me small gifts, saving something for me because they “knew I’d like it,” checking in on me, wanting me included, etc. Sometimes it’s coworkers, friends, classmates, sometimes it’s people I’ve met randomly socially. A few people have also said things like I’m “rare,” “special,” “intimidating,” etc.

My reaction tends to be:

1. I’m skeptical and assume there’s an ulterior motive, and
2. I still end up exercising control and (kind of) encouraging the behavior, partly because I assume it isn’t genuine.

Concrete examples:

I work and study, and in my master’s program I’m a minority in terms of sexual orientation. It’s a physics/engineering environment where like 75% of my class are straight men (and one bisexual girl). In this kind of setting, it feels like getting attention and having people offer to do things for you is… very easy.

For example: I lost my sweater, and a classmate immediately asked me what color it was, where I last saw it, etc. He went searching everywhere, gave it back to me, and then got me a coffee while he was at it. I *know* part of this is because I check his programming assignments for him (I like coding), and because he has a crush on me.

I’m also very close to another classmate. One day I was really upset about something related to a situationship I have (I’m seeing a couple… yes, it’s complicated). He noticed and bought me flowers on the spot. He also buys me nicotine pouches and spends extra time teaching me a software I’ve been meaning to learn. But I keep waiting for the shoe to drop; for him to say something that makes it impossible for us to stay friends. At the same time, I catch myself trying to make him feel special and keep him close so I can ensure things go the way I anticipate.

He told me one of his friends in the master’s doesn’t like me / thinks I’m conceited and intimidating. I obviously didn’t like hearing that, so I overcompensated: asked her tons of questions, singled her out in group settings, tried to connect. Turns out she had a crush on me. Now when I text her, my friend gets messages from her about how excited she is about me, and I feel like I can “control” the situation; send a message occasionally and see the effect.

This ends up reinforcing a belief I hate having: that people only do these nice things because they think they can “get with you,” not because they genuinely like you as a person. And then another part of me almost blames them for being “stupid” about it and letting attraction control them. Even though I’m afraid of losing people because of this (it’s happened in the past), I sometimes push dynamics in that direction anyway; almost to create a feedback loop of “see, it’s exactly what I predicted.”

Then there’s work, which is where my current situationship started. My coworker had been talking about me to his girlfriend for months, saying he hadn’t felt this way about someone in 11 years, and he told me he idolized me. She wanted to meet me. At first it was shaky because she obviously wasn’t happy about it, but since then she and I have become quite close (honestly closer than I am with him, because I trust her more and I really don’t want her to feel uncomfortable). This whole thing has been drifting in a relationship direction.

He thinks he controls it, but I’ve been hedging my bets with both of them and trying to make myself the central “trusted” person. I personally think they’ve been together a long time and might be bored, which is part of why they’re interested in me. Either way, the feeling that I’m taking less risk while having high control calms my distress.

Recently though, I noticed myself getting attached to *her*. I got tired of thinking about it, so I stopped texting and found someone else to have relations with because I was afraid of losing control. I’ve been honest with them about a lot of this. They’re under the impression I can turn off feelings instantly and leave immediately, and part of me thinks I actually *will*do that if I feel like I’m losing control.

I’ve told them I don’t get why they’re so nice and that something feels wrong about all of this. They tell me to relax and just accept it. I drank too much one night and told them to leave me the f\*ck alone, and they stayed and supported me anyway. I’ve been anxious and guilty about that because I can tell I’m trying to push them away, partly to prove to myself that it’s all just a game.

I think a lot of this obsession with control stems from not trusting people. I don’t think people really care unless they gain something, either short-term or long-term (and maybe that’s just how humans operate, I don’t know). When people are kind, instead of feeling grateful, my brain immediately goes: what’s the motive? Are they trying to get something from me? Is this a long game? Are they projecting onto me? Are they trying to secure access to me? I hate that I think like this.

The other part I don’t want to dodge: I’m pretty good at reading what people respond to, and I *do* tailor myself. If I see a strategy works (being intense, confident, flirtatious, emotionally expressive, competent), it feels like I’m “winning.” I also sometimes like the validation too much, like making people admit they like me, even though I know I’m often emotionally unavailable and not going to give them what they want long-term. I’m not proud of that. It feels manipulative and gross when I say it out loud.

I also hate indifference. I’d almost rather someone dislike me than be neutral. I want to be impressive, memorable, intimidating  and at the same time I’m terrified of someone seeing the “real me” and judging it as not enough. I think that’s the core fear: being seen clearly and judged. When I feel that threat, I control harder. I keep multiple connections at once (like diversifying a portfolio) so I’m never too dependent on one person. I move on quickly. I stay hard to pin down. People chase, and then I get tired and need a ton of alone time.

Externally I come off super confident/high functioning. Internally I feel like I’m constantly managing a social model and it’s draining. I don’t even know if I’m authentic anymore or just good at self-presentation.

I want to change this because it’s starting to affect my relationships. I’ve even lashed out when I felt insecure (drunk, said something nasty to someone who was actually being loyal/kind). I don’t want to be that person. I guess part of me just wants to know if this is how we all operate out of fear and out of self preservation or if this is something that I should change.",1,1767621147.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1q4m4ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChevyAvalanche/comments/1q4m4ws/where_is_the_aim_of_life/,where is the aim of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I matched with someone on Hinge last week. Super cool profile, works in Fintech, loves coffee. We decided to meet at this trendy new roastery in Indiranagar (won't name it, but you know the vibe: unfinished walls, lots of plants, and ""minimalist"" furniture).

We got a table in the outdoor section. The seating was literal concrete benches with a thin, aesthetic cushion that was maybe 1mm thick.
I sat there for 2 hours trying to be charming and flirty. But in my head, I was screaming with pain.

See, I work from home. I have spent way too much time curating my workspace. I have a proper chair and I use that gel-based frido cushion because my tailbone gets sore easily. I am spoiled by comfort.
Sitting on that concrete bench was pure torture.

Every time I laughed at her joke, a shockwave went up my spine. By the time the bill came, my legs were numb. When I stood up, I looked like a folding chair unfolding. I couldn't even walk her to her cab properly because I was so stiff.

She probably thought I was awkward or drunk. No, Shreya, I just have the spine of a 60-year-old software engineer.

I'm looking to build a twee little romantic roleplay that initially begins with a strong focus on romantic tension and flirtation, before our characters eventually dive into their desires.

Our story would be set in Pumpkinshire - a cosy little town in the south of Scotland, where every street has a family owned bookshop, and the roads are swamped in piles of crumpled brown leaves.

As for our characters? Well - that's up to us to build together! I find that all writers have a specific type of character that they like to play, and I want to hear yours. Personally, I like to play a sort of shy, bookish nerd who has recently had their confidence knocked by some kind of traumatic event - usually a bad breakup. I love plots in which my character has their self-confidence reignited by a woman who makes them feel loved and desired. But that's just one type of character I like to play!

Oh, but you want \*some\* suggestions for who to play, do you? Just something to get the ball rolling? Well, let's see...

Are you a professor in the local university, fed up of the empty, uncultured minds that litter your lecture halls all day, longing to meet someone who truly shares your unending passion for literature?

Or maybe you're a Hollywood A-Lister who has grown weary of the Beverly Hills lifestyle, retiring to Pumpkinshire for a slice of normality...

But hold on... could you be Pumpkinshire's dark secret? The long rumoured demon that resides in that dark alleyway behind the coffee beans shop, finally taking your form as a beautiful seductress, looking for an innocent soul to corrupt and take to your lair?

I'm also open to integrating characters from Marvel or DC worlds!

As for me, little old me? Well, at this time of my life, my gender is rather nebulous to me. I have exclusively played women opposite women when I began RPing around 5 or 6 years ago, however I've recently fallen in love with playing futanari women - though it should be noted that I am **not** interested in playing opposite male characters - sorry boys!

If you're craving the same romantic/smutty escape that I am - please reach out!

I look forward to opening those orange envelopes...",1,1767620820.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

1q4m2ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1q4m2ao/5_subtle_signs_youre_actually_making_progress/,5 subtle signs you're actually making progress (even when it doesn't feel like it),"I hit a major low point last year. Depression, anxiety, zero productivity, and a general feeling that I was falling behind in life. I started working on myself but constantly felt like I was getting nowhere.

Six months later, I realized I had actually made significant progress without noticing. There were subtle signs that change was happening even when I couldn't see the big transformation I was hoping for.

For anyone feeling stuck on their self-improvement journey, here are the small signs that indicate you're actually moving forward:

1. You notice your negative patterns faster

Before, I would spiral into negative thoughts for days before realizing what was happening. Now I catch myself within minutes or hours. The pattern might still start, but my awareness kicks in much quicker.

This is actually huge progress. Awareness is the first step to change.

1. Your ""bad days"" aren't as bad as they used to be

My bad days used to mean not getting out of bed, ignoring messages for days, and completely abandoning self-care.

Now, a bad day might mean I skip a workout and eat some junk food, but I still handle basic responsibilities and bounce back faster. Your baseline is slowly rising, even if you don't notice it.

1. You feel uncomfortable with old environments

When I visited friends who are still in the same negative patterns, I felt strangely uncomfortable rather than at home. This discomfort is actually a sign that you've outgrown certain environments or behaviors.

Growth often feels uncomfortable before it feels good.

1. You're more specific about your struggles

Instead of saying ""I feel like crap"" or ""I can't focus,"" you can identify more precisely: ""I'm feeling anxious about this specific situation"" or ""I'm having trouble focusing because I didn't sleep well.""

This specificity means you're developing better emotional intelligence and self-awareness.

1. You have more moments of genuine peace

They might be brief, but you occasionally experience moments where you feel genuinely okay - not ecstatic, just peaceful. You might be doing something simple like drinking coffee or walking and realize you're fully present and not ruminating.

These moments tend to increase gradually in frequency and duration.

Progress isn't always visible in the ways we expect. Sometimes the most significant changes are happening beneath the surface, in how we relate to ourselves and process our experiences.

Have you noticed any subtle signs of progress in your own journey? Sometimes acknowledging these small wins can provide the encouragement needed to keep going.",2,1767620735.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,1.0,False

* Lelit Mara X ($2,600)
* ECM Mechanika Max PID ($3,300)
* Rocket Appartamento TCA ($3,000)
* Profitec Move ($3,000)

HM (haven't read very much on them): Profitec RIDE, Profitec Jump, and Profitec Pro 400

I've owned a Barista Express for 10 years. I upgraded the grinder to a DF64. I think it's time to upgrade my machine now.

95% of the time I make 1 or 2 espressos at a time, mostly milk-based. I use mostly medium roast coffee, but maybe I would love some light roasts with a more capable machine. Maybe 5 times a year, we host and I make 4-6 espressos.

My main complaints about the BBE are:

1. Consistency between shots
2. Milk steaming time too slow

Note that I don't mind (I think) the heat-up time, I would use a smart switch. But I think I would leave the machine on probably all day to get a spontaneous coffee since I work from home.

So mostly my questions are:

1. Do I absolutely need a dual boiler based on my use case?
2. E61 or not?

As someone who struggles with between meal eating and overeating for that matter I really like how it can fill me up. Usually I’ve gone with their original coffee flavour because it tastes the best, but didn’t have the best benefits. More recently I’ve opted for the higher protein vanilla flavour which has been more nutritious but way less flavourful. 10 minutes ago I just tried something with their high protein vanilla drink that will be my new standard. Nespresso makes these amazing Espresso Concentrates, I’ve recently purchased them from Costco. I thought to myself “what’s the harm if I put some of this into my boost”. This is a game changer, as someone who loves coffee I have found the perfect balance of coffee flavour to sweet creaminess. Dare I even be bold enough to claim that the “chalky” protein taste is way more hidden now. I’m no scientist so I can’t attest to how healthy this may all be, but the flavour is easily an 8/10 for coffee drinkers. Highly recommend trying this.",1,1767620720.0,nutrition,1,1.0,False

I just got myself v60, Timemore C3s grinder and really nice specialty Ethiopean coffee.

For my first try, i set my grinder to 13 clicks and tried Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 method. V60 clogged. It was shallow, sour and the coffee bed looked muddy as hell so the recommended setting was way too fine. I also now that Ethiopena coffee tends to produce fines so

On my second try I set my grinder to 17 clicks, which was better but v60 clogged again with 4:6. Less sour and just a little bit more complex but still not close to ideal at all.

On my third, i tried hoffmann's method with 17 clicks. It clogged. God that was terrible.

I tried 19 clicks with 4:6 this morning it was not clogged but it was the worst one.

On my last one, i set my grinder to 19 clicks, tried 50gr bloom - 200 (swirl) - 320. It was WAY better. no sourness but kind of bitter. V60 wasn't clogged. So i am guessing i went from under extracting to over extracting.

But again it's a really good pack of beans and i am not using it properly. Not getting that complex falvors.

What can i do to improve?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1q4lxmx,https://ryjoxdemo.com/,Paying for short Postgres-focused customer research (15–30 mins) $200,"  
Hey all,

I’m one of the founders of a small deep-tech startup working very close to Postgres and modern database infrastructure. We’re doing some focused customer research to sanity-check a few assumptions around where Postgres-based systems still hit real pain as they scale, especially around coordination, state, latency, and cost that people tend to accept as “just how it is”.

This is not a sales call and I’m not trying to pitch anyone. I’m explicitly looking to learn from people who actually operate, build on, or deeply understand Postgres in real-world systems. Senior engineers, architects, SREs, founders, all welcome.

Happy to pay $250 for 15–30 minutes of your time, or if you just enjoy helping and want to chat informally, beers / coffee are on us as well. The goal is honest feedback, not validation.

  
You’ll see we’re working on a low-level persistent memory / state layer designed to sit close to compute. I’m deliberately not going deep on that here, as I’d rather listen than talk.

If this sounds like something you’d be open to, feel free to comment or DM. If not, no worries at all, and happy to take any public thoughts too.

I like facts, regardless of what I’m dealing with, and everything around conceiving and pregnancy seems so up in the air. Do I take my medication? Do I not? Can I drink coffee? Can I not? Can we get testing done straight away so we know what we are working with? Do we have to wait til we have blindly tried for 12 months? (Not actually asking for ‘answers’ here btw). 
It’s obviously all so personal and I understand that but the uncertainty is sending my brain into overdrive! I’d rather know before going through a potential emotional roller coaster if there are any issues so that we can address them.

1q4lv5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/comments/1q4lv5q/infiniment_coty_paris_review/,Infiniment Coty Paris Review,"Hello,

I am typically in the Indie Perfume group but I have some thoughts on this brand that isn't indie. I went to Merz apothecary in Chicago and they gave me some samples of Infiniment Coty Paris. Here are my thoughts but keep in mind that I am a just a regular person, not an expert in anyway. Some of the background information I found, might be wrong.

Coty is a big company that used to make its own perfumes but now mostly it distributes other name brand's fragrances such as Calvin Klein and Burberry. Now they have their own revival collection that is supposed to honor their original formulas.

**The Bad:** Before I get into a review of the individual perfumes I want to address a big claim that this brand is making. An article from [10 Magazine](https://10magazine.com/infiniment-coty-paris-londons-creative-community/) wrote in March that the company has ""patent-pending technology"" called molecular aura, which is supposed to make their perfume last up to 30 hours. This is also advertised on the [Coty Brand website](https://eu.infinimentcoty.com/products/aristo-chypre). Whenever you click on a perfume, underneath the description and price, it clearly states that this fragrance will last up to 30 hours. That is a lie. These fragrances lasted anywhere from 3 to 5 hours on my skin, which is perfectly fine. But if you are going to advertise long lasting fragrances, specifically stating up to 30 hours, then they need to last up to 30 hours. Not to mention these are extremely expensive fragrances. The price for a 75ml is 230€ and a 150ml refill is 330€.

**Long Story Short:** These are extremely short lived fragrances (compared to what is advertised), that are very basic and a couple have an issue with feeling synthetic. In my opinion, none of these are good or even interesting. At best, I would describe most of these as ""average."" At the price they are asking, I would want something that is going to blow my socks off.

The Fragrances:

* **Aristo Chypre**
   * **Notes:** Chypre Accord, Patchouli, Rose
   * **Thoughts:** This is a freshly cut rose that has just started to bloom. The rose is dusted with sweet powder and then it is laid out on the coffee table in your grandparent's living room. Its a well loved room with warm wood walls and the faint scent of spice lingers in the furniture. This is a nice rose scent that leans a little vintage. I typically don't like rose scents, but this is a fairly crowd pleasing. Its not a bad scent but its boring and doesn't stand out from the pool of other vintage rose scents. Also, I would say the name is misleading. A chypre typically opens with bright citrus notes that contrast against earthy and woody dry downs. This fragrance does not have a bright and citrusy. This fragrance lasted maybe 4 hours on my skin.
* **Encore Une Fois**
   * **Notes:** Vanilla Orchid, Bourbon Vanilla, Peru Balsam
   * **Thoughts:** This is the smell of visiting your Grandma's house. In her bedroom is the faint lingering scent of her distinct aldehyde bomb perfume mixed with her creamy vanilla lotion. There is something very grandma vintage about this vanilla fragrance that makes it lean a little into synthetic territory. It does open a bit creamy and with hints of wood that invokes a slight feeling of warmth and coziness, but not a whole lot. Its not gourmand, experimental, luxurious, or anything. Just a synthetic leaning vintage vanilla. Its not a bad fragrance, I just felt bored. This fragrance lasted maybe 5 hours on my skin.
* **Entre Genres**
   * **Notes:** Musk, Tangerine
   * **Thoughts:** This is as if you bought some soap at local farmer's market. It smells of bright citrus with hints of delicate white flower petals and some wood. The first time you use it is for your morning shower, its sharp notes wake you up and makes the day feel brighter. The soap creates a really thick lather, so thick you cannot wash it all off. So when you get out of the shower, a layer of the citrus soap covers you, its practically a second layer of skin. You go about your day and the citrus quickly dissipates and without that fresh cover, all you are left with is smelling heavily of soap, its almost cloying. Then a synthetic, slightly scratchy, underbelly develops that isn't very pleasant. This fragrance lasted about 5 hours on my skin
* **Noir Encens**
   * **Notes:** Black Pepper, Frankincense
   * **Thoughts:** This one I liked the most but that isn't saying much when everything else is just so underwhelming. This smells like an old church pew that is decades old. It has soaked up the scent of the church incense and the slightly citrus varnish used to keep it nice. Except it is has been moved. It used to reside in a small but well loved community church into a new and sterile looking church. Its like this new church has no character and cannot invoke any emotion from its congregation. So they attempt to emulate that home community feeling by stealing their pews. The peppery wood infused over the years slowly looses it scent, becoming generic just like its new home. Once the last breath of its character leaks out of the wood, the plastic seeps in. Another fragrance from this line with a synthetic problem. Also, this fragrance lasted about 5 hours on my skin.
* **Soleil d'Ikosim**
   * **Notes:** Neroli, Orange Blossom, Vetiver
   * **Thoughts:** This is walking amongst a grove of orange trees where the blossoms have fallen and the fruit is starting to develop. But this isn't a peaceful or contemplative walk, this is stomping through the rows and mashing up the flowers underneath your boots. The floral pulp lathers almost like soap, overpowering the other notes of wood and citrus. Some of the mash gets on your skin and by the end of the day it does ease up into a soft and sweet scent on your skin. This isn't a delicate or complex scent. Its mostly thick and almost soapy florals with hints of wood and citrus underneath. It feels like a lot is missing. Like the ingredients are all there to take me on a journey through this orange grove, but it feels like they are not communicating with each other. This scent lasted maybe 4 hours on my skin.",1,1767620214.0,Perfumes,2,1.0,False

1q4lu0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChevySuburban/comments/1q4lu0d/what_is_the_meaning_of_life/,what is the meaning of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1767620131.0,ChevySuburban,1,1.0,False

Hey Maximizers! 👋

Ever feel like life's just throwing curveballs, and you're fumbling in the dark trying to catch them? What if I told you there are actual *cheat codes* to navigating it all? Not magic spells, but tried-and-true ways to unlock your best self.

Let's talk about *optimizing*. It sounds technical, but it's really about tweaking things for maximum impact.

Think about your morning routine. Is it a rush of chaos or a calm launchpad? Even a few minutes of focused intention – a quick meditation, journaling a few thoughts, or just enjoying your coffee in silence – can shift your entire day.

And how about learning? We're not in school anymore, but our brains are built to grow. Are you actively feeding yours? Whether it's a podcast on your commute, a book before bed, or learning a new skill online, tiny investments in knowledge pay massive dividends.

Don't underestimate the power of connection. *Real* connection, not just scrolling. Spending quality time with people who uplift you, having deep conversations, or even just a genuine laugh can be incredibly powerful for your well-being.

Sometimes, though, those curveballs feel a bit *too* heavy. When you're struggling to find your footing, reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness. For anyone feeling overwhelmed or just needing a listening ear, you might find [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) helpful.

1q4lszs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q4lszs/i_have_to_let_it_go/,I have to let it go,"Our relationship has been really difficult. I have made a lot of mistakes, I've reacted too angrily. But it was a real rollercoaster, I was constantly anxious because of the hot and cold.

I never knew if she was feeling bad because of me, I tried absolutely everything in those moments. It would happen so often. It happened anytime I was with my friends or family, despite her saying it had no link, it had to happen in those moments, which made me be on my phone for so long when I should have been sharing moments with my surrounding.

I dedicated so much of my time and thoughts to us and her. 

The other day she acted this way again, I kept my calm the whole time, she denied it again, again it was like I'm crazy and imagining things. But she still blamed me, she mentioned at this moment how she was here for me the weeks before, how emotionally difficult it was, even though it's sometimes really hard for me to discuss about my problems, even though I've always been there for her. She told me again she doesn't owe it to me (not being cold), she doesn't owe me a bit of constance and stability?

She did things that would have made her break-up with me a long time ago, continued to talk super often with a tinder hookup she had during the first break-up behind my back, despite seeing me crying about it for weeks. I never even asked her to stop talking with her, just asked for some clarity, and I was apparently the crazy one for feeling bad about it.

So recently she lied again about talking to another girl from tinder.

When she was living there at my place, she could get jealous for absolutely anything, she went so cold on our anniversary night that I had organized because I had sent a text to my coworker asking about an object I had forgotten at work. She went mad at me for inviting my best friend over, she went mad about my relationship with my sister in law. She made me feel weird and anxious anytime I tried to socialize. 

I absolutely never betrayed her, I absolutely never flirted or did anything like that since we know each other. She did that.

The day before my birthday she went at a party, not telling me it was with her ex, I don't even care, but she has to do those things and make me feel like shit if I just ask about it, she made me feel like crap the whole day of my birthday, why?

Because some days before I said I was sad that she didn't seem to have think about it, she then realized it and made flowers delivered at my house. I was supposed to be with my sister, she guilt tripped me whole day about it, I had to go back home sooner to get those freaking flowers, I don't even like receiving fresh flowers, she told me how expensive it was, how she shouldn't have make an effort. She lied about it telling me she planned this a long time ago, and yes I had to ask the owner of the flower shop if it was actually planned before, sure it was not, but for one time I could have a proof of the gaslight, and yes she blamed me for asking. I cried so much during this day, I cried at the pharmacist for wishing me a happy birthday.

What did I do for her birthday? Organized a whole trip in the city, with a cruise, a beautiful restaurant, organized little surprises, a big bag of gifts, a hotel in her favorite area. It's the day after coming back that she told me on the phone about still talking to the tinder girl.

I feel like I have to finally respect myself, she literally told me she wouldn't change, why should I hope?

It is extremely hard for me, I don't fall in love easily I never fell in love with someone else. But I did my best, I made so much efforts, I've been there a lot, I worked on myself, I gave her without thinking, I tried to make our relationship beautiful as much as I could. 

After blaming me for days, for things I acknowledged and apologized for, after denying again everything, after forcing me to text when I kept asking for time on my side to rest, she now comes back telling me she thought about the situation and she realizes she was ""not fully right about everything"".

She says she misses me, she says she's sad it has to end over a fight. But it's not a fight, it's 3 years of constant anxiety. She knows her behavior hurts me, she saw me totally break down, she saw me isolating myself, she saw me suffering, and she never tried to make an effort. 

She just sent me she'll always be here for me, really? But if I dare to share my emotional pain she'll throw it back at my face anytime she acts distant so I feel like shit? 

She's always here for me? But if I tell her I'm going to be less on my phone because I'm with my sister she'll stonewall me for entire days? 

She's always here for me but she'll do stuffs to me that she would never accept receiving?

She's always here for me but she'll make me feel guilty, ashamed, and extremely anxious for things that happened in my life?

My love is not enough, and I want a quiet life.

I'll have my place on the country side with dogs, goats and chickens, making art, going on walks, cooking food, learning things, laughing. I did everything that was possible, she's the one who's going away, she's the one who never wanted.

During those past days I was at my best friend's place. Despite spending again too much of my time on the phone and feeling extremely anxious I was able to have fun. We went eating at her friend's place, we simply discussed, laughed and eat. They told my friend nice things about me per text the day after. It made me so emotional because I realize how much I just need that, normal moments with people, I ended thinking only bad things about myself, I ended feeling like I'm such a twisted woman, like I'm not easy to be around, like I'm not actually loveable. The day after we went to have a coffee in the city, when we left the owners told me i sound like a really nice person making a heart with their hands, it's ridiculous, it's nothing, but I was really about to cry.
I helped a woman on the street for a complicated situation the day before, she also told me thank you and how nice I am. 

I'm not saying I need to be told I'm nice all the time, but I just realize how much I isolated myself and created this really dark perception of myself. 

Those little moments mean so much to me right now.",2,1767620053.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Build a UPI-native loyalty platform for independent cafés in India that works without POS hardware, without touching payments or settlement, and with near-zero operational effort from café staff. The product acts as a loyalty ledger, not a marketplace. It passively tracks visits via a dedicated QR code and rewards repeat behavior, while offering optional, tightly guardrailed promotions to drive incremental footfall.

The Problem

Indian cafés rely on UPI QR payments, not POS systems Existing loyalty solutions require hardware, settlement integration, or café-specific apps Punch cards and coupons are operationally messy and unreliable Small cafés lack visibility into repeat customers and loyalty ROI

The Solution

A QR-based loyalty layer that sits alongside UPI payments. Café displays a platform-provided QR The customer pays using any UPI app Payment settles exactly as it does today Platform records the visit and updates loyalty No settlement. No wallet.

I saw it through the window of your overpriced flat

Five stories up, feeling cinematic and all that.

The first flakes fell like a curated Instagram post

Pure, untouched, white as a Victorian ghost.

I thought, ""God, this is it, we’re in a Richard Curtis film,""

Ignoring the fact that you’re a prick and I’m at the helm

Of a sinking ship fueled by expensive gin and bad tattoos.

You looked like a saint in the streetlight, nothing to lose.

(Pre-Chorus)
But then the sun came up and the magic took a hit

The neighborhood dogs started doing their bit.

And the silence? Oh, the silence was lovely for an hour

Before the radiator hissed and the milk went sour.

(Chorus)
Now it’s just grey, salty slush on the side of the road

Like the way you look at me when you’re about to explode!

It was a winter wonderland, a pristine, white sheet

Now it’s just frozen piss and cigarette butts on the street.

Oh! The honeymoon’s over, the ice is a mess

It’s a lukewarm coffee in a stained silk dress
.
You’re not a snow globe prince, you’re just a Tuesday afternoon—

Salty, grey, and melting way too fucking soon!

(Verse 2)
The metaphor’s a bit on the nose, I’ll admit it

Like your technique in bed—yeah, you really overhit it.

Last night it was ""I love you"" and ""Wrap me in your arms""

This morning it’s ""Where’s my charger?"" and car alarms.

The snow’s turned to that sludge that ruins your boots

Tracing the rot right down to our shallow-ass roots.

It’s like after the come-down, or the wet spot on the duvet

Beautiful for a second, then just... in the way.

(Bridge)
I built a cathedral out of frozen water!

I was the ice queen and you were the... well, the martyr.

But the salt trucks came with their industrial greed

To melt down the fantasy and reveal the weed

Growing through the cracks of this suburban hell!

I rang the bell! I rang the fucking bell!

But you were just snoring through the slushy transition

From a romantic lead to a boring addition!

(Chorus)
Yeah, it’s just grey, salty slush on the side of the road

Like the way you look at me when you’re about to explode!

It was a winter wonderland, a pristine, white sheet

Now it’s just frozen piss and cigarette butts on the street.

Oh! The honeymoon’s over, the ice is a mess

It’s a lukewarm coffee in a stained silk dress.

You’re not a snow globe prince, you’re just a Tuesday afternoon—

Salty, grey, and melting way too fucking soon!

(Outro)
Yeah.

It’s all very ""aesthetic"" until you have to walk in it, isn't it?

Your socks get wet. 

Everything smells like exhaust fumes and disappointment.

You’re basically a slushie, babe. 

But without the sugar.

Just the salt.

And a lot of... grey.

My desire to work and do a good job in my daily job is returning again. No longer as lethargic or sluggish in the workplace. I thank NoFap for that.

I’m also noticing my desire for gaming is dwindling away. It seems as if NoFap makes me desire real world connection and relationship over fantasy reality, which is good as I believe any life well lived is not going to include video games.

I am an employee at Suntory, responsible for the product development of the canned coffee brand BOSS. I apologize for bringing up personal matters, but my hobby is horse racing, and I’ve been occasionally buying horse racing tickets for a little over six years. The reason I got hooked on horse racing was the Arima Kinen (Grand Prix) on Sunday, December 27, 2015—coincidentally, the retirement race of Gold Ship.It was dusk at Shinjuku Station. The cheers and cries of the crowd gazing at the large screen in front of the station captivated me in an instant. I had no idea there was a sport that could ignite such passion among fans. From that day on, horse racing became an obsession, evolving from a weekend pastime into a part of my daily life. The individuality of the racehorses, the stories behind each one, the legacy of their bloodlines—horse racing grew deeper the more I learned about it. It was no longer just a sport; it felt like watching my own children grow, keeping me glued to the races and the horses. Before I knew it, I had accumulated knowledge that rivaled that of a friend with 20 years of racing experience.One day, an advertisement caught my eye. It depicted a vast turf with characters sporting horse ears and tails sprinting fiercely. “What is this (shock)?” I was utterly stunned. “Uma Musume Pretty Derby???—It seems to be inspired by horse racing, but as a racing fan, I was initially perplexed, though I couldn’t deny my curiosity. A few days later, I saw people engrossed in this game everywhere—on the streets, in trains, you name it. “What is this (awe)?” There had to be a reason so many were captivated. “This isn’t just a game. It’s market research,” I told myself, and that’s when I downloaded it, marking the beginning of everything…As the download progressed, I was greeted by an exhilarating opening screen leading into a movie titled “URA Finals.” The lineup of Uma Musume about to race left me speechless: No. 1 Narita Brian, No. 2 Symboli Rudolf, No. 3 Machikane Fukukitaru, No. 4 Agnes Tachyon, No. 5 Halu Urara, No. 6 Nice Nature, No. 7 Grass Wonder, No. 8 Silence Suzuka, No. 9 Special Week, No. 10 Tokai Teio, No. 11 Mejiro McQueen, No. 12 Rice Shower, No. 13 Gold Ship, No. 14 Mayano Top Gun, No. 15 Daiwa Scarlet, No. 16 Vodka, No. 17 Oguri Cap, No. 18 Super Creek… Names of legendary racehorses spanning eras were all there. As the race began, Silence Suzuka took an early lead, and the Uma Musume dashed across a turf course replicating a real racetrack. Strangely, I couldn’t look away. “Am I the only one who feels like these are real racehorses running?” Though I hadn’t played many games like this, their intense drive to win hooked me completely. The winner was Special Week, the game’s icon, and then came the “Winning Live” performance—dancing and singing! “The first-place horse sings center stage!?” The elaborate choreography and production left me marveling at modern game technology. Though I initially wondered how racing and live performances connected, those thoughts soon vanished. Winning Live? Amazing!As I progressed, a tutorial had me training Daiwa Scarlet, and soon I chose Vodka for her cool appearance. Winning a race and seeing my trained Vodka sing center stage in the Winning Live filled me with joy, like a proud parent. “I’ve got to make her win again!” Her running pose with raised arms, saying “Thanks, I owe ya!” melted my heart, and I realized, “This is a game I’ll keep training them for.” That was the moment I was convinced of Uma Musume’s depth.“What is this (shock)?”—as I mentioned, that was my initial reaction to Uma Musume. But now, it’s “What is this (amazement)!” I’ve played horse racing-themed games before, but never imagined I’d be this hooked. This is a first for me.Why am I so captivated? Let me break it down.First, the respect for horse racing is incredible. It goes beyond distance aptitude or preferred courses—coat colors, stars, personalities, color schemes, racing silks, even the color of the menko (blinkers) worn by the original horses are woven into the character designs with astonishing detail. For example, male horses have right-ear decorations, females left—something racing fans might expect—but details like differing shoe designs for horses with mismatched legs are mind-blowingly thoughtful. The dedication is thrilling. Courses like Tokyo’s long straight or Nakayama’s short straight are faithfully recreated, reflecting the developers’ genuine love for racing.Second, the storytelling is divine. Expecting a lighthearted “Pretty Derby” with cute girls frolicking? I’d scold my naive self. Based on dramatic real-life racing history—victories, losses, injuries, struggles, and even being labeled heels—the main story, events, and anime unfold with shonen manga-level intensity. Imagining what racehorses felt during their races or what if Silence Suzuka had finished the Tenno Sho (Autumn) stirs the soul. Each Uma Musume’s drama, like “Eclipse first, the rest nowhere,” exudes unmatched charisma. For me, King Halo’s story—crying over not winning the Kikuka Sho with “My trainer’s too stubborn!” and her resolve in the Takamatsunomiya Kinen with “I’ll claim my own strength. Isn’t that enough?”—moved me to tears multiple times. And Rice Shower? I adore—nay, adore—her story. Meeting her in the main story’s Chapter 2, “The Little Hard Worker,” her tenacity against Mihono Bourbon and Mejiro McQueen in the Kikuka Sho and Tenno Sho (Spring) brought tears to my eyes. Her Winning Live after races is indescribable, and her pressure-filled journey earns my respect, alongside the caring Mejiro McQueen and Mihono Bourbon.I could go on—unrealized dreams like Maruzensky in the Japan Derby or Tokai Teio in the Kikuka Sho, or unexpected character interactions make the fictional aspect a delight. This accessibility hooks both racing fans and newcomers. My dream? Asking every trainer, “What’s your favorite training event and Uma Musume?”—the variety would be endless.Enhancing this is the game’s top-notch technology. Smooth races, high-quality Winning Lives, and the charm of the Uma Musume are flawless. Motion capture from actors and dancers brings their personalities to life, explaining why they felt like real Thoroughbreds at first glance. The balanced difficulty—challenging yet rewarding, with a dash of luck—fuels my drive. The euphoria of a near-perfect training after struggles, echoed by the lyric “Even effort feels joyful” from “Yume wo Kakeru!” is unmatched. Without the community’s momentum—story events, Legend Races, Champions Meetings, Aoharu Cup, and Climax arcs—I might’ve quit. The constant updates keep it alive, boosting my real-life motivation too.The game’s versatility shines—racing fans dig into backstories, trainers chase victories, music lovers enjoy the OST, and character fans adore the personalities. There’s something for everyone. Even if gaming isn’t your thing, the anime (both seasons) offers a great entry—trust me, a friend raved about it after my recommendation.As a racing fan-turned-trainer, I must highlight how Uma Musume reaffirms racing’s greatness—Symboli Rudolf’s unbeaten seven crowns, Tokai Teio’s miraculous Arima Kinen comeback, Oguri Cap’s idol farewell, Narita Brian’s 15-length Kikuka Sho win, Air Groove’s pioneering mare success, Silence Suzuka’s fearless lead, and T M Opera O’s turf mastery. Revisiting races or discovering new ones through the game is a joy, even predicting new Uma Musume from hints.As a working trainer, I start my day logging in for bonuses, checking my circle, and tackling daily missions before work—usually greeted by Rice Shower’s “A present arrived! Can we look together…?” or “Why am I not growing taller despite milk every morning…?” Her lines brighten my day. Post-work training, even on overtime days with limited rental runs, sharpens my focus, oddly boosting work efficiency. On off days, I grind factors or team races, analyzing skills and strategies. Rare victories, like Gold Ship’s dropkick win, fill my photo roll. When tired, I poke Rice Shower, swap her with Halu Urara or Mihono Bourbon for chats, or watch “A Modest Prayer” to tear up.This passion led me to wonder if I could tie it to my job. BOSS, a companion to workers, parallels Uma Musume’s runners. A data hint about overlapping coffee and racing fans sparked an idea, but I needed more. Defying initial rejection, I pitched a “BOSS x Uma Musume collab boss jacket” for BOSS’s 30th anniversary, mirroring training jerseys with a “speed boost skill” and featuring 13 Uma Musume in past designs—Symboli Rudolf in the ‘92, Biwa Hayahide in ‘93, Narita Brian in ‘94, Mayano Top Gun in ‘95, Mejiro Dobel in ‘96, Air Groove in ‘97, Special Week in ‘99, Manhattan Cafe in ‘03, Zenno Rob Roy in ‘05, Sweep Tosho in ‘05, and Kitazan in ‘17. Prizes like QLD cards and keychains await campaign participants.Sorry for the rush—Uma Musume is my treasure chest of love. To busy workers, parents, or anyone struggling, I hope BOSS and Uma Musume offer respite. Join the campaign to share the joy. Despite life’s hardships, let’s run together. Thank you, Uma Musume, for coloring my life since 2021. I’ll keep chasing dreams without looking back. Uma Musume, I love you!!!! Forever!!!!The person in charge loves it too much

I saw it through the window of your overpriced flat

Five stories up, feeling cinematic and all that.

The first flakes fell like a curated Instagram post

Pure, untouched, white as a Victorian ghost.

I thought, ""God, this is it, we’re in a Richard Curtis film,""

Ignoring the fact that you’re a prick and I’m at the helm

Of a sinking ship fueled by expensive gin and bad tattoos.

You looked like a saint in the streetlight, nothing to lose.

(Pre-Chorus)
But then the sun came up and the magic took a hit

The neighborhood dogs started doing their bit.

And the silence? Oh, the silence was lovely for an hour

Before the radiator hissed and the milk went sour.

(Chorus)
Now it’s just grey, salty slush on the side of the road

Like the way you look at me when you’re about to explode!

It was a winter wonderland, a pristine, white sheet

Now it’s just frozen piss and cigarette butts on the street.

Oh! The honeymoon’s over, the ice is a mess

It’s a lukewarm coffee in a stained silk dress.

You’re not a snow globe prince, you’re just a Tuesday afternoon—

Salty, grey, and melting way too fucking soon!

(Verse 2)
The metaphor’s a bit on the nose, I’ll admit it

Like your technique in bed—yeah, you really overhit it.

Last night it was ""I love you"" and ""Wrap me in your arms""

This morning it’s ""Where’s my charger?"" and car alarms.

The snow’s turned to that sludge that ruins your boots

Tracing the rot right down to our shallow-ass roots.

It’s like after the come-down, or the wet spot on the duvet

Beautiful for a second, then just... in the way.

(Bridge)
I built a cathedral out of frozen water!

I was the ice queen and you were the... well, the martyr.

But the salt trucks came with their industrial greed

To melt down the fantasy and reveal the weed

Growing through the cracks of this suburban hell!

I rang the bell! I rang the fucking bell!

But you were just snoring through the slushy transition

From a romantic lead to a boring addition!

(Chorus)
Yeah, it’s just grey, salty slush on the side of the road

Like the way you look at me when you’re about to explode!

It was a winter wonderland, a pristine, white sheet

Now it’s just frozen piss and cigarette butts on the street.

Oh! The honeymoon’s over, the ice is a mess

It’s a lukewarm coffee in a stained silk dress.

You’re not a snow globe prince, you’re just a Tuesday afternoon—

Salty, grey, and melting way too fucking soon!

(Outro)
Yeah.

It’s all very ""aesthetic"" until you have to walk in it, isn't it?

Your socks get wet. 

Everything smells like exhaust fumes and disappointment.

You’re basically a slushie, babe. 

But without the sugar.

Just the salt.

And a lot of... grey.

One of my friends constantly buys food for another friend (a guy). Takeout, coffee, snacks—she’s almost always the one paying. The issue is that he never reciprocates. He also rarely says thank you. Sometimes there’s no acknowledgment at all.

This isn’t a one-time thing. It’s been going on for a while, and it’s noticeable to everyone. What makes it worse is that he doesn’t seem financially incapable—he just lets her do it. No offer to split. No “I’ll get you next time.” Nothing.

From the outside, it feels very one-sided and kind of exploitative. She’s generous by nature, but he seems comfortable taking without giving anything back, even basic gratitude.

I’m not trying to diagnose anyone, but I’m wondering:
	•	Is this a sign of narcissistic or entitled behavior?
	•	Or is this just emotional immaturity and poor manners?
	•	At what point does this stop being “nice friend” behavior and start being taken advantage of?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1q4lgji,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1q4lgji/how_to_build_a_morning_routine_that_actually/,How to Build a Morning Routine That Actually Makes You Feel ALIVE: The Neuroscience That Works,"Most people wake up already behind. Checking their phone, hitting snooze three times, dragging themselves through the morning half-asleep. I used to think this was just how mornings worked until I realized the real issue: we're fighting against our own biology instead of working with it.

After diving deep into neuroscience research, particularly Andrew Huberman's work (he's a Stanford professor and neuroscientist who runs the Huberman Lab podcast), I completely rebuilt my mornings. The difference? I'm not just more productive. I actually feel awake and energized instead of like a zombie until noon.

Here's what actually works, no fluff:

**Get sunlight within 30-60 minutes of waking**

* Your brain has this thing called the suprachiasmatic nucleus that controls your circadian rhythm. Sounds fancy but basically it's your internal clock that regulates when you feel alert vs. sleepy.
* Morning sunlight (even on cloudy days) triggers a cortisol pulse that wakes you up naturally and sets your sleep-wake cycle for the next 24 hours. This isn't just feel-good advice, it's literally how your brain chemistry works.
* Go outside for 10-15 minutes. If you can't get outside, sit by a window. Just scrolling your phone with the brightness up doesn't count, sorry.
* Huberman covers this extensively in his podcast episodes on sleep and circadian rhythms. The guy has spent decades studying how light affects the brain and this tip alone changed my energy levels completely.

**Delay caffeine for 90-120 minutes after waking**

* I know this sounds wild but hear me out. When you first wake up, adenosine (the chemical that makes you tired) is naturally clearing from your system. Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors.
* If you drink coffee immediately, you block adenosine that was already leaving, which leads to a harder crash later and dependency on caffeine just to feel normal.
* Wait 90 minutes and your coffee actually enhances your natural wakefulness instead of replacing it. You'll feel the difference within a few days.
* Try the **Apollo Neuro** wearable if you want extra support with energy regulation. It uses gentle vibrations based on neuroscience research to help your nervous system shift into different states. Honestly game-changing for managing my stress response throughout the day, not just mornings. The science behind it is solid, developed by neuroscientists and physicians, and it's way less invasive than constantly drinking coffee.

**Move your body early (even just 10 minutes)**

* This doesn't mean you need some intense workout. Even light movement increases core body temperature which signals to your brain that it's time to be active.
* Dopamine and norepinephrine (focus chemicals) get released with movement. You're basically giving yourself a natural brain boost.
* I do push-ups, jumping jacks, or a short walk. Whatever gets your heart rate up slightly. Some days it's literally just stretching on my living room floor and that's fine.
* **The book ""Spark"" by John Ratey** (he's a Harvard psychiatry professor) goes deep into how exercise affects your brain chemistry. It's not just about fitness, it's about optimizing your mental state. This book completely shifted how I think about movement and made me realize exercise is basically medication for your brain.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from quality sources like research papers, expert talks, and book summaries to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on what you want to improve. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it's designed for people who want structured self-growth without the usual information overload.

What makes it useful is the customization. You can adjust both the length (quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with examples) and the voice style to match your energy. Some mornings call for something energetic to keep focus during a commute, other times a calmer tone works better. The app also has a virtual coach called Freedia that you can pause and ask questions mid-session, which helps when certain concepts need clarification. Worth checking out if you're already into optimizing routines and want science-backed content that fits your specific goals.

**Cold exposure (if you can handle it)**

* Cold showers or even splashing cold water on your face triggers a massive adrenaline release that increases alertness and mood for hours.
* You don't need to suffer through 5 minutes of freezing water. Even 30-60 seconds at the end of your shower works. Or just cold water on your face and neck.
* Huberman talks about this in his episodes on dopamine and cold exposure. The research shows cold can increase dopamine by 250% and the effects last for hours. Wild stuff.
* If cold showers feel too extreme, try the **Wim Hof Method app**. It guides you through breathing techniques combined with gradual cold exposure. The app has structured programs that make it way less intimidating than just jumping into an ice bath. Wim Hof is the ""Iceman"" who's worked with researchers to study how cold exposure and breathwork affect the nervous system and immune function.

**Eat protein within the first few hours**

* Protein provides amino acids like tyrosine that your brain uses to make dopamine and other focus-related neurotransmitters.
* Starting with carbs or sugar creates blood sugar spikes and crashes that mess with your energy and focus. Protein keeps things stable.
* Aim for 20-30 grams. Eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shake, whatever works for you.
* I learned this from **""The 4-Hour Body"" by Tim Ferriss**. He's obsessed with biohacking and breaks down the science behind protein timing and metabolism in super practical ways. Some of his stuff is extreme but the morning protein thing is backed by solid research and actually simple to implement.

The thing about these tips is they sound almost too basic. But that's the point. Your biology doesn't care about complicated routines or expensive supplements. It cares about light, movement, temperature, and fuel. Get those right and your brain just works better.

You don't need to do all of this perfectly tomorrow. Pick one thing. Maybe it's just getting outside in the morning. Do that consistently for a week and see how you feel. Then add another piece.

1q4lfws,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1q4lfws/how_to_unblock_pinterest_anywhere/,How to Unblock Pinterest Anywhere,"You're sitting in class, on break at work, or traveling through China—and Pinterest won't load. That spinning wheel mocking you while your inspiration board sits just out of reach. Frustrating? Absolutely. But here's the good news: getting Pinterest unblocked is actually pretty straightforward once you know what you're dealing with.

>✅ **Quick Answer:** The fastest way to unblock Pinterest is with a VPN. Connect to a server in a country where Pinterest isn't restricted (like the US or UK), and you'll have full access in under a minute. NordVPN works reliably for this—I've tested it on multiple restricted networks.

# Why Can't You Access Pinterest?

Before diving into solutions, it helps to understand *why* you're blocked in the first place. There are typically three culprits:

**Government censorship.** China has blocked Pinterest completely since March 2017, right around the National People's Congress. The platform sits behind the Great Firewall alongside Facebook, Instagram, and most Western social media. North Korea and Bangladesh maintain similar blocks, while Iran, Cuba, and Syria restrict business features.

**School and workplace networks.** This is the most common scenario. Network administrators block Pinterest to reduce distractions, save bandwidth (all those high-res images add up), and maintain ""appropriate"" browsing policies. If you've ever seen ""This site is blocked"" on a school Chromebook, you know exactly what I mean.

**ISP-level restrictions.** Rare in most Western countries, but some regions have ISPs that block or throttle access to specific platforms.

# Method 1: Use a VPN (The Reliable Option)

A VPN routes your traffic through a server in another location, effectively changing your apparent location. Your school network thinks you're browsing from New York instead of the library. The Great Firewall thinks you're somewhere in Europe.

# Why VPNs Work Best for Pinterest

Pinterest is image-heavy. Really image-heavy. That means whatever method you use needs to handle bandwidth without choking. Free proxies? They'll make scrolling through boards feel like dial-up internet. A solid VPN maintains speeds while actually keeping your activity private.

# Step-by-Step: Unblock Pinterest with a VPN

1. **Choose a VPN provider.** I recommend NordVPN—it has obfuscated servers that disguise VPN traffic (important for strict networks) and consistently fast speeds for image-heavy sites.
2. **Download and install the app.** Available for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and browser extensions.
3. **Connect to a server.** Pick a country where Pinterest works without restrictions. The US, UK, Germany, and Canada are solid choices. For school/work blocks, any server outside your local network works.
4. **Open Pinterest.** That's it. Your connection now appears to originate from your chosen server location.

>💡 **Pro Tip:** If you're in China or another country with aggressive VPN detection, enable obfuscated servers. On NordVPN, switch to OpenVPN protocol first, then select ""Obfuscated"" from the specialty servers list. This masks your VPN traffic as regular HTTPS browsing.

# Best VPNs for Unblocking Pinterest

|VPN|Servers|Speed|Obfuscation|Price|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|6,000+ in 60 countries|Excellent (NordLynx protocol)|✅ Yes|$2.99/mo (2-year plan)|Heavy censorship, school blocks|
|**Surfshark**|3,200+ in 100 countries|Very Good|✅ Camouflage Mode|$2.29/mo (2-year plan)|Budget-friendly, unlimited devices|
|**ExpressVPN**|3,000+ in 105 countries|Excellent|✅ Lightway|$8.32/mo (1-year plan)|Ease of use, reliability|

# Method 2: Web Proxy Sites (Quick but Risky)

Web proxies act as middlemen—you type the Pinterest URL into their site, and they fetch it for you. Simple. But there are catches.

# How to Use a Web Proxy

1. Navigate to a proxy site (Hide.me, KProxy, or ProxySite are common options)
2. Enter `pinterest.com` in the URL field
3. Browse through the proxy interface

# Why I Don't Recommend This for Pinterest

Proxies work for quick text-based browsing, but Pinterest is *heavily* visual. You'll experience:

* **Slow loading times.** Those beautiful high-res pins become a slideshow.
* **Broken functionality.** Logging in, saving pins, and creating boards often fail.
* **Security concerns.** Free proxies can inject ads, track your activity, or worse.
* **No encryption.** Your school or workplace can still see you're using a proxy, even if they can't see the content.

>⚠️ **Warning:** Never enter login credentials through a free proxy. They can capture your username and password. If you must use a proxy, stick to browsing only.

# Method 3: Change Your DNS Settings

Sometimes Pinterest blocks happen at the DNS level. Your network's DNS servers simply refuse to resolve pinterest.com to its actual IP address. Switching to a public DNS can bypass this.

# How to Change DNS on Windows

1. Open **Settings** → **Network & Internet** → **Change adapter options**
2. Right-click your connection → **Properties**
3. Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** → **Properties**
4. Choose ""Use the following DNS server addresses""
5. Enter: `8.8.8.8` (primary) and `8.8.4.4` (secondary) for Google DNS
6. Click OK and restart your browser

# How to Change DNS on Mac

1. Open **System Settings** → **Network**
2. Select your connection → **Details** → **DNS**
3. Add `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`
4. Click OK

# Limitations

DNS changes work against *basic* blocks only. Sophisticated firewalls (like in China or well-configured corporate networks) use Deep Packet Inspection that DNS changes won't bypass. It's worth trying—takes two minutes—but don't expect miracles.

# Method 4: Switch to Mobile Data

Here's the simplest workaround if you're on a restricted WiFi network: disconnect and use your phone's cellular data.

Your school or workplace blocks Pinterest on *their* network. Your mobile carrier? Probably doesn't care what you browse. Just watch your data usage—Pinterest's image-heavy nature can burn through a limited plan fast.

>📌 **Key Takeaway:** Mobile data bypasses local network blocks but not country-level censorship. Won't help in China, but works great for school WiFi.

# Method 5: Use the Tor Browser

Tor routes your traffic through multiple encrypted nodes, making it extremely difficult to track or block. It's overkill for Pinterest in most situations, but if you're dealing with serious censorship, it's an option.

# The Trade-off

Tor is *slow*. Like, really slow. Those multiple hops add latency that makes scrolling through Pinterest boards painful. I'd only recommend Tor if:

* You need maximum anonymity
* VPNs are actively blocked in your location
* You're okay with a degraded browsing experience

# Unblocking Pinterest on Specific Devices

# Chromebook (School-Managed)

School Chromebooks are locked down. You can't install traditional VPN apps, and admin policies restrict most workarounds. Your options:

1. **VPN browser extensions** that aren't blocked by your school's app whitelist
2. **Web-based proxies** (if not blocked)
3. **Mobile data** on your phone instead

Honestly? Getting Pinterest unblocked on a managed Chromebook is the hardest scenario. Your school controls the device at a system level.

# iPhone/iPad

1. Download a VPN app from the App Store (NordVPN, Surfshark, etc.)
2. Open the app and sign in
3. Connect to any server outside your restricted network
4. Open Pinterest

iOS makes VPN setup dead simple. One tap to connect, and you're browsing freely.

# Android

Same process as iOS:

1. Install from Google Play
2. Connect to a server
3. Open Pinterest

Android also allows sideloading VPN APKs if your school blocks the Play Store.

# Countries Where Pinterest Is Blocked or Restricted

|Country|Status|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**China**|Fully blocked|Since March 2017. Requires VPN with obfuscation.|
|**North Korea**|Fully blocked|Extremely limited internet access overall|
|**Bangladesh**|Blocked|Restrictions on multiple social platforms|
|**Iran**|Partial|Basic Pinterest works; business features restricted|
|**Cuba**|Partial|Business accounts and ads blocked|
|**Syria**|Partial|Similar to Iran|

If you're traveling to any of these countries, download and set up your VPN *before* you arrive. Downloading VPN apps from within China is significantly harder.

# Will Pinterest Ban You for Using a VPN?

Short answer: No.

Pinterest doesn't actively hunt VPN users. They care about spam bots, copyright violations, and fake accounts—not people connecting through different IP addresses. That said, avoid rapidly switching between vastly different locations (New York one minute, Tokyo the next) as that *could* trigger security reviews.

Using a VPN for privacy and access is perfectly legitimate. Millions of people do it daily.

# Free vs. Paid VPNs: Is It Worth Paying?

I get it—paying for software when free options exist feels unnecessary. But with VPNs, you genuinely get what you pay for.

|Feature|Free VPNs|Paid VPNs|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Speed**|Usually throttled|Full speed|
|**Data Limits**|Often 500MB-10GB/month|Unlimited|
|**Server Locations**|Very limited|Dozens of countries|
|**Privacy**|Questionable (many sell data)|Verified no-logs policies|
|**Pinterest Performance**|Sluggish, images load slowly|Smooth scrolling|
|**Obfuscation**|Rarely available|Available on premium providers|

For occasional, quick browsing, Proton VPN's free tier is decent. But if you want Pinterest to actually *work* well—fast image loading, smooth scrolling, reliable access—a paid VPN is worth the $3/month.

# Troubleshooting: Pinterest Still Won't Load

VPN connected but Pinterest still blocked? Try these fixes:

**Clear your browser cache.** Cached location data can persist even after connecting to a VPN. Clear cookies and cache, then reload.

**Switch servers.** Some VPN IP addresses get flagged. Try a different server in the same country, or switch to another country entirely.

**Try a different protocol.** If standard WireGuard or NordLynx isn't working, switch to OpenVPN. Some networks block specific protocols.

**Enable obfuscation.** Strict firewalls detect VPN traffic patterns. Obfuscated servers disguise your connection as regular HTTPS.

**Use the mobile app instead.** Sometimes web versions face stricter blocks than apps. Try the Pinterest app while connected to your VPN.

**Check for DNS leaks.** Visit a DNS leak test site while connected. If your real location shows, your VPN might be misconfigured.

# My Honest Take

Look, if you just need Pinterest for a quick project at school, switching to mobile data is the easiest path. No setup, no software, works immediately.

But if you're dealing with ongoing restrictions—traveling frequently, living in a censored country, or working somewhere that blocks everything fun—investing in a reliable VPN pays off. I've tested NordVPN across multiple scenarios, from coffee shop WiFi to hotel networks in countries with serious restrictions. It works consistently, and the speeds handle Pinterest's image-heavy content without the frustrating lag you get from proxies or Tor.

Whatever method you choose, Pinterest doesn't have to stay out of reach. Pick your tool based on your situation, and get back to saving those inspiration boards.

>🎯 **Bottom Line:** A VPN is the most reliable way to unblock Pinterest from anywhere—whether you're battling school WiFi, workplace firewalls, or government censorship. NordVPN handles all three scenarios well, but the key is choosing a provider with fast servers and obfuscation features if you need them.",1,1767619062.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

Marcus' journal - day 11

Now since I’ve graduated and have a job I don’t care much about I find it so hard to get up and go in the morning. I find it so so so hard to get out of bed. Half because it’s so warm and cozy and half because I just don’t want to. I try to wake up early (around 7 am every depending on when I work, sometimes earlier if I need to) to have a slow morning and process my existence before work but then I’ll wake up and think “I have three hours to work why am I getting up now”

I’d like to change this. When I do get out of bed I try to avoid being on my phone I’m not always successful or sometimes I’ll put on a podcast. I’d like to try to get to the gym before work some days but all I can manage is to get up, make coffee and breakfast, and sit and eat/drink and zone out (and maybe lay on the floor)

I go to bed on average around 12-1 I’m going to try to go around 11. I have no issues falling asleep I have good methods to get me sleepy and typically I’m awake for a max of 30 mins in bed. But I’m going to try and reduce my screen time now an hour before bedtime.

I’m not looking for rushed exchanges or one-line flirting. I’m drawn to tension that takes its time. To conversations that unfold in long paragraphs, layered with detail, mood, and intention.

Picture this: **NYE.** A warm house glowing under soft lights. Music humming low in the background. Familiar faces, shared history, easy laughter. We’re married, settled, surrounded by people who know us well ""*too* well"" actually haha And yet, there’s a pull we’ve never acknowledged out loud. A secret attraction hidden in lingering eye contact, brushed fingers while passing a glass, smiles that stay a moment longer than they should.

That’s the space I want to explore.

This is a **slow-burn cheating fantasy,** consensual, unspoken, and charged. Sensual rather than loud. Romance wrapped in restraint. Desire built through presence: the right outfit, the right fragrance, the quiet confidence of standing close without touching. Kinky not because of what happens immediately, but because of what’s delayed.

I’m especially drawn to women who love **ethnic outfits,** sarees, silk, subtle jewelry, soft florals. Who understand how fabric, fragrance, and posture can say more than skin ever could. Flowers on the table. A shared look across the room. Knowing exactly what you’re doing without anyone else noticing.

I want to flirt with intention. To admire. To tease. To let oral tension, romance, and longing simmer beneath polite conversation. A couple dynamic where attraction is acknowledged, not denied. Where being wanted feels intoxicating, not possessive.

**Who I’m hoping to hear from: This is imp actually**

Netflix's Evil Influencer: The Jodi Hildebrandt Story Exposes the Twisted Mormon Therapist Who Tortured Kids in the Name of God,"After watching that hit-piece documentary [The Mormons: Who They Are and What They Believe](https://share.google/Kj72PJLRKCz3GF9uI) on Amazon, The Jodi Hildebrandt story on Netflix and reading[ Moroni and the Swastika](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0806146680?ref_=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cp_ud_dp_GT0K72R7E7ZTCB19PF2P) by David Conley Nelson, I've got seriously mixed feelings about the Mormons.  I think a lot of them get shell-shocked in their mid-to-late twenties or early thirties.  ***Do you think they are a cult?  Why or why not? Do you think Jodi used Mormonism to enable coercive control?*** 

Check out this video [(https://youtu.be/XVQT5zkYLEg)](https://youtu.be/XVQT5zkYLEg) where a Christian pastor totally catches these Mormon missionaries off guard and they fumble hard on the most basic question: Why don't real Christians accept the Book of Mormon as part of actual Christian doctrine, yet Mormons keep desperately insisting they're Christians? He's so polite about it and the whole convo is captured on his Ring porch camera.   The Bible is the single unifying foundation of all Christianity...if you reject it as your sole reference for truth and instead worship some extra fan-fiction book cooked up in the 1800s, you're obviously not Christian! Just admit it already! It's pathetic watching them pretend their whole lives, dodging the truth like that. Stop the charade! 

The chilling Netflix doc about Jodi affirms my supposition that Mormonism is very culty: Jodi Hildebrandt, a devout LDS ""therapist"" and life coach, built a manipulative empire through her ConneXions program, preying on vulnerable  families with extreme shame tactics, sexual repression, and ""religious extremism."" She brainwashed mommy vlogger Ruby Franke into starving, binding, and torturing her own kids...claiming it was to exorcise demons and achieve spiritual purity.  Former clients describe her as running a full-blown cult within the church: breaking up families, demanding total obedience, and twisting scriptures to control everyone. Hildebrandt rose unchecked in Utah's Mormon community, even after getting her license probationed...she just rebranded as a ""life coach"" and kept grifting.  The abuse only stopped when one emaciated kid escaped her basement dungeon with duct tape wounds. Both women are in prison now, but the doc shows how Mormon culture's obsession with perfection, obedience, and secrecy enabled this monster. If this isn't peak cult behavior (isolating people, guilting them into submission, and justifying horror as ""God's will"") what is? **Mormonism's wholesome facade is cracking, and stories like Jodi Hildebrandt's prove that questioning whether is a cult or not is kinda valid at this point.**  

Christians don't charge admission fees to access their most sacred spaces or lock out ""unworthy"" members from God's presence. But Mormons? They've got this exclusive, pay-to-play temple system where only the elite few who cough up a full 10% tithe and pass rigorous worthiness interviews get to enter and everyone else is barred.  It's straight-up divisive: families get split apart during temple weddings because non-tithing or ""unworthy"" relatives can't come inside to watch. People sink into guilt, shame, and anguish when they're rejected or excommunicated, losing access to their own eternal family sealings. All because they didn't pay enough or confess enough. Totally not Christianity...more like a cultish country club with eternal consequences.

 They genuinely believe everything they've been spoon-fed is the ultimate truth until they step into the real world and find out that actual Christians don't accept the Book of Mormon.    

Mormons love to half-joke about their own church being a cult (“Haha, we’re totally a cult, right?”) which pretty much proves they know exactly how it looks from the outside. They lean hard into that squeaky-clean public image: honest, hardworking, wholesome, clean-cut families who don’t even touch coffee. Everyone eats it up and thinks, “Wow, what great people!” But inside the bubble, tons of them are starting to wake up to the creepy cult-like dynamics: the crushing guilt that keeps people trapped, the fear of losing your eternal family if you leave, the way you’re raised to believe you’re part of God’s elite while secretly looking down on everyone else. They act all rebellious by chugging caffeinated soda like it’s some wild vice “Look at us, we ‘swig’ Dr Pepper, we’re so straight edge we party pure!”while turning around and bragging about underground swinger scenes in Utah counties. Real risqué stuff, guys.  And let’s not pretend this is actual Christianity. Polygamy and polyamory were core doctrines under Joseph Smith and Brigham Young...dozens of wives, some teenagers, some already married to other men. That’s not a “tenet of Christianity”; that’s a tenet of Mormonism. Screaming “But we love Jesus!” at the top of your lungs doesn’t make you Christian when you reject the historic Holy Trinity, teach that God was once a man, and add brand-new scriptures that contradict the Bible.

They know it looks culty. They joke about it. They profit from the wholesome facade. But deep down, a lot of them are stuck...too guilty to leave, too proud to admit the whole thing isn’t what it claims to be.   

Then there's Joseph Smith...a polyamorous dude who married dozens of women, including 14-year-old girls and women who were already married to other men. Sure, plenty of guys back then were creepy, but he took it to industrial levels. It's wild that they'd worship a guy who was such an obvious con man and fraudster that an angry mob literally shot him dead in Illinois.

They've also got this ugly history of explaining darker skin as a divine curse for wickedness...straight out of their scriptures. Even if they've tried to walk it back lately, that garbage is still printed in their book.  



Back in the mid-2010s when I was living out West, I met a nomadic woman named Tanya in her 40s. She told me her devout Mormon family kicked her out at 16 just for “rebelling” basically daring to question things or push back against the strict control.   With nowhere to go and no support, she spiraled into extreme poverty, abusive relationships with men and meth addiction. She said it all stemmed from horrific memories of abuse she endured inside the church: stuff that still haunted her years later. Hearing her story straight from her mouth absolutely shattered any lingering positive illusions I had about Mormonism at the time.  

That encounter permanently changed my view but it didn't crystallize until the JVA experience: if their “perfect” families and tight-knit communities can discard a teenage girl like trash and leave her so broken that she ends up on the streets, something is deeply, deeply wrong with the whole system.   If they can create a whole treatment center franchise where people with disabilities are exploited and abused then...damn, sky's the limit? 

Their whole tiered-heaven setup, where only the elite Mormons get the top spot, seems to breed a smug superiority complex. I've seen it firsthand at a shady treatment center called John Volken Academy that turned out to be backed by Mormons (I had no idea at the time) they lied and took my labor and money without batting an eye. 

It's all left me thinking they're a bit cold, cultish, and clannish. They're everywhere in the media right now thanks to popularized shows like The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, and they're overrepresented in three-letter agencies because they don't drink, don't do drugs, and are trained from childhood to keep secrets and follow orders blindly. Perfect recruits.

Mormonism is accepted in America primarily for their fiscal and procreative contributions which makes them useful actors to The State.  High birth rates keeping the numbers up = talent and taxes to extract from and therefore many of the things they do that hurt people get brushed under the rug for the ""greater good"".

I served them our CHNK Cookies along with their coffee and they absolutely loved it. Got some great reactions as well.

I haven't been bulimic now for 18+ months. I never get urges at all anymore. It's actually a weird feeling once you do eventually recover. The voices go silent. I genuinely thought I would just need to live with the voices for the rest of my life. That constant urge to binge/purge. 'ordinary' people will never have any clue just how powerful those urges are. 

This is the part that infuriates me. I recently just opened up to my partner. Just told them I was bulimic and explained everything. Their response. Why didn't you just stop though? Like what's the point in doing it that? 

I seen red...... Lol

My partner drinks alot of coffee. I said. OK stop your coffee from today onwards. They said. No chance. I said well if it's as easy as 'Just stop it' why can't you just.... Stop it. Still they couldn't understand it. 

I also remember going to an eating disorder specialist in the UK. Our NHS eating disorder advisors are very poor. Well mine was. I remember the first appointment her just looking at me and just saying. OK we're going to stop doing these behaviors. Do you understand how much damage your causing? I just said.. Do you honestly think I like burning my esophagus with stomach acid and wasting thousands and thousands of pounds? Do you think I enjoy having debilitating anxiety and depression daily from blood sugar swings and malnutrition? I just said. If this is your tactic of fixing these issues I'm sorry but your success rate is going to be 0%. These issues are deep inside the brain. 

Has anyone else noticed this? I hate singling people out but the older generation have zero clue about these issues. They think that because it barely existed in their youth that it will barely exist now. 

Bulimia/Anorexia have the highest mortality rate of any disorder in America. I just wish people could actually understand how tough these conditions become. I just remember feeling so helpless and lost deep into my disorder. I felt like a failure. 

Anyone else?

The general advice is: Find your gang, do some sports, participate on some clubs, go to meet ups and lastly that there are a ton of whatsapp groups created and you may fit into their theme, and if that's working for you then great! however for many people, introverts, or people that just don't know where they fit or how to redo their social life this is not going well.

It may look silly, but one of my goals for 2026 is to feel better integrated, to find meaningful connections here, to feel that I am in a network where I make a positive impact, where people can come over for a chat and have a coffee on a random sunday afternoon where they just need someone to talk, maybe a thing of the past to many but that I still hold dearly.

1q4l375,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q4l375/potential_talkingstage_comeback/,potential talking-stage comeback,"Hi everyone!

I want to start off by saying that I, 20F, am a very glass half full, rose coloured glasses, delulu-deluxe, incredibly hopeful kind of person. I also grow attached VERY quickly lol. I am therefore incapable of being objective here. Therefore I desperately need advice and opinions from normal people with working brains - thanks in advance!

So I matched with this guy on hinge. We had great conversations and connected very well over the app, so he asked for my snapchat. (That’s the normal communication form here in Scandinavia, I know a lot of you will find that weird, but here it’s the norm). We continue talking on snap. Normal getting to know each other stuff, but fun with a lot of banter and humor. We talk pretty consistently every day for a little under two months (don’t mention it, I know). He was the one initiating most conversations. He seemed engaged and interested in our convos, and also in getting to know me - asking beyond “small talk” questions, if that makes sense. He had “long-term” on his profile, and never gave me the impression that his goal was to just sleep with me - hard to explain how, I just felt that he respected me and understood that I don’t do casual - he never implied that’s what he wants either. The connection felt very mutual and although he was probably talking to other girls, I got the sense that I was prioritised and a genuine interest on his end. He remembered small things I told him weeks ago in snap (text over picture) conversations, and sent me random updates and videos on what he’s up to unprompted. This is the part I really don’t think is me being delusional - I truly believe the connection and interest was mutual. Definitely stronger on my end, but sill mutual. He also called me once and we talked on the phone for a little over an hour. This is where it started feeling real to me. The conversation flowed and I love his sense of humor and the way he made me feel overall. At this point I really wanted to move it off the screen and give it a real shot. We had talked about meeting each other multiple times before and also discussed the logistics (we live kind of far apart). So I sent him a message saying something like:

“I’m feel I’m starting to loose interest by just snapping. I’d love to meet you in person if that’s something you want. If not, that’s completely fine”. (My hope here being to nudge him to ask me out)

He responded:“lets try and actually meet next week then” 

and explained that he’s been busy (this was around Christmas time so makes sense). There are many more details that contextualise more, many days and conversations I’m leaving out, but I want to keep this short. At this point I did sense a slight pull back, still in contact, but longer reply time and not as eager to talk. The week goes by and he never brings it up. I ask again if his plan was for us to meet soon - he gives me a vague non-answer. At this point I should’ve just taken the hint and left him alone, but I decide to take matters into my own hands and ask him if he wants to grab a beer or a coffee together sometime next week. He doesn’t answer. The next day I’m kind of pissed and offended at him ignoring me when I put myself out there like that, so I double text and said:

“I’d rather get a no than being ignored”. 

He got back to me and said: 

“I promise I didn’t mean to ignore you. I just half swipe to prepare an answer and forget about it. (He has ADHD so I do buy that idk). But I don’t think I’m in a dating phase right now, and I don’t want to waste your time. Like, it just doesn’t fit right now” (he used a word that usually means “fit” timing wise, not sure how to translate it).

I replied saying I understand and appreciate his honesty, and thanked him for letting me know.

He then replies saying:

“Of course I’ll say if things change! Cause its general to everyone. I’ve deleted my dating apps. I’m just tired/fed up hahah (unsure about translation here). So it's not you. But its not fair for you to wait”

I say: 

“Yeh, that’s completely understandable and great that you let me know! I’m happy it's not me hahaha. I hope I wasn’t too annoying(emoji). But yeh, just let me know, and if I’m available too we’ll see. I think we could be a good match”

He says:

“I absolutely think so too. (Replying to my chat about it being me): nono ahahah. (Replies to my chat about being annoying) not this either, no hahah.” 

I say:

“Hahah that’s good to hear, I’m relieved”

He leaves me on read. 

Thats where we're at now and also where my questions begin:

1. Do you think he may come back to me if he decides he wants to date again or was that just something he said without meaning it.

I know that’s something people just say. The only reason I question it is because he could’ve left it at the first message. He’d done his “obligation” and rejected me. I accepted it without questions or being emotional. He could’ve ended it there and walked away with a clean conscience. But he voluntarily added more context, explanation, reassurance, and more importantly: opened the door to reconnection if things change - completely unprompted by me. 

Would he do that unless there was truth to it? Am I being delusional by assuming that signals he actually means it? Do you think he lied about deleting the apps and this being an everybody-thing to make me feel better? Does this seem like just a “I don’t want to hurt you”-white lie-rejection, or the truth? Are talking stages even a big deal to men? Will he forget me in a week? Was I too pushy and annoyed him? I’m really bad with hints, I realise now he gave me many at the end - is that a turn off forever? I’ve never had the nerve to put myself out there like this before, therefore I’ve never been rejected, so this is unfamiliar territory for me. I need help!

2. If anyone relates to what he said, a sort of dating-fatigue, how long did it take you to get over it? I know this is subjective, but an estimate. 

3. If he hasn’t reached out to me in 2-3 weeks is it acceptable for me to attempt to lightly reach out again or would that be desperate? 

He left me on opened, so he clearly wants space, I’m gonna give him that. The reason I ask is not cause I’m waiting for him, i’d never wait for anyone. The thing is, before him I really wasn’t looking for anything at all. I am very content being single, always have been. I honestly just joined dating apps for validation and an ego boost lol. I wasn’t looking for, nor was I expecting to actually find someone who interested me. In other words: he was the exception to my “I want to stay single”,”I’m not looking for a relationship”-mindset. I’m back to that mindset now though. Not really looking for anything or pursuing for a relationship actively. You never know, but I doubt i’ll find anyone else in the nearest future anyway, just back to not putting effort into it. I like being single, but if this guy wants to try I’d like that more! As I told him, I really think we could be a good match. He ticked all my boxes. Therefore I still want the door for us to get to know each other to be open - incase he’s interested later on. No contact would surely close it, he’d probably just forget about me after a while. Therefore I need advice on how to establish neutral contact - no expectations - just a reminder of my existence and a “I’m still here and warm to reach out to”. I don’t want to bother a guy who wants nothing to do with me, but his words make me think this was a timing/energy issue - not me or the connection itself. Could be wrong there though. If there is the slightest chance of him reaching out again later, i’d like that to at least be on the table. This without him thinking I’m hung up on him and have no one else. I am, and I don’t, but I don’t want him to know that. 

My thought is that whenever he’s in the mood to date again, even if he has found memories of me and our connection - reaching out to someone you’ve had no contact with for weeks or months feels drastic, blunt and unnatural. Even if you want to, that would put most people off. Whereas reaching out to someone you remember having a good connection with, who’s notification is also a normal part of your day to day, even without direct conversational contact, would feel more natural, easy and make for a smoother transition - perhaps increase my chances?

So if he hasn’t reached out first after 2-3 weeks is there a neutral way for me to try and reestablish contact? Season two of a show he recommended to me comes out around that time estimate - could that be my in? Would you think someone was desperate or hung up if they reached out in that way - just asking if you’ve seen it and what you think? I’m a person who reaches out to people I haven’t talked to in YEARS and ask to catch up cause I have a day off. I don’t really see that as weird or unnatural, but I know I’m in the minority here. Doing something like that is very much in my character, but he doesn’t know me like that and may think it's deeper than it is. Would you be annoyed or happy they thought of you? Any other suggestions to non awkward, no pressure reconnection attempts? Do you think he’d answer if I did? Do you think he wants me to leave him alone forever or just give space? If it was forever would he flag the potential reconnection? Do you think this would make a difference at all? Do guys even go back to old talking stages after a dating break, or do they prefer to start from scratch? Anyone been in a similar situation and it turned out well? Did I give him the ick or turn him off me forever by being pushy and not taking the hint? Is that something guys remember and hold on to - like, did it taint his view of me? I feel like we left it on good terms and that I gave him a good last impression, but you never know - he may think I’m the weirdest most desperate chick in the world.

1q4kzqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malliem/comments/1q4kzqv/my_baby_daughter_wont_stop_laughing/,My baby daughter won't stop laughing.,"It started with my husband not acting like himself.

One night a few weeks ago, Milo returned from work, and our daughter had only just stopped laughing.

He left me with her all day. All day with her relentless laughing that was cute at first. 

There was nothing cuter than an infant’s laughter. But she didn’t stop. Mara was born laughing. 

Unlike other newborns, who were born screaming or even silent, our baby was laughing.

I thought it was adorable at first

She was my first, so motherhood was new to me. 

Mom always told me my maternal instinct would just kick in, and she was right. 

When Mara was in my arms, a warm bundle pressed against my chest, I decided I was going to protect her.

But I wasn’t expecting my newborn baby to be laughing.

I thought it was some kind of problem at first, maybe with her lungs. 

Her giggles did come out kind of throaty, like she was wheezing. 

I demanded tests, but Mara was completely healthy.

I took her home from the hospital and expected her to stop, but she never did. 

She laughed when she was feeding, laughed when she was playing, even giggling to herself in the middle of the night. I admit, I’ve done things a mother should never do. I secretly wished she would stop. I secretly wished she’d cry instead.

Somehow, crying made me feel more sane. It was normal to stay up until dawn with a crying baby, but laughing?

I spent countless hours trying to keep myself awake and when I did manage to fall asleep, I was jerked back awake minutes later by little Mara’s giggling.

It was as if she were saying, “Don’t sleep, Mommy! Play with me!”

I didn’t have the heart to tell her she was slowly killing me. My bones felt like liquid lead. My brain was mush.

It was late when Milo finally came downstairs. Mara was sound asleep in my arms.

I was watching a TV that wasn't on. I was watching Netflix, but I could barely register what was going on. I was furious. 

He left me. Again. After promising to look after Mara while I took the afternoon off. 

I texted him, but of course, he’d turned off his phone; of course, my texts weren’t being delivered.

“Hey.” My voice carried more bite than I intended when I caught him sneaking toward the refrigerator, no doubt planning to eat the leftovers from dinner. He froze in my peripheral vision, pulling open the door.

Milo was hesitant in answering. He hated confrontation. “Uh, hey,” he stumbled over his words. “Babe.”

He said, “Babe,” like a question.

“Where were you?” I asked calmly. I could feel myself splintering, my eyes watering. I told myself I wouldn’t cry.

“I..” Milo drifted off into a sigh. He pulled out a soda and leftover chicken and rice from dinner. 

I watched him crack open the can, take a long sip, picking at chunks of chicken. 

I resisted the urge to snap at him to get a damn plate. He was eating like an animal.  
Milo offered me a small smile, and in the fluorescent light I glimpsed dark shadows under his eyes. “It’s complicated.”

Complicated.

I almost laughed.

“You could have helped me,” I  whispered, careful not to wake little Mara. 

She mumbled in her sleep, her head tucked into my chest. “With putting our daughter to bed.”

He chuckled, a sour edge to his tone. “Yeah, I'm good, dude.”

Dude?

Since when did my husband say “dude”?

“You promised.” I spoke through my teeth this time, unable to stop myself.

“You said you would let me sleep and take care of everything.” I had to swallow sobs, my chest heaving. “When I woke up, she was laughing, Milo, and you were nowhere to be seen. You were gone. Again.”

I twisted to find him standing over the sink, his back to me. 

My husband was eerily still. 

He held a cup as if to fill it. 

But he wasn’t filling it, he was just fucking standing there, letting water pool off of it. 

The stream was running, quickly overflowing, and he wasn’t turning it off. 

“Milo.” My voice cracked despite myself. “There’s something wrong with you. You’re not helping with Mara. You leave everything to me, her diapers, her bedtime, everything you promised the day I told you I was pregnant. You promised you’d be there for her. Milo, you called her the best thing that ever happened to you, and now you can’t even look at her.”

He didn’t move. 

Didn’t deny it. 

His arms tensed, fingers curling into fists. The faucet began to overflow, suds soaking the floor.

I couldn’t hold back a sob. 

Everything spilled out, words tumbling over one another, staining my tongue, dripping down my chin. 

“You’re disappearing at night, and you’re not even sleeping with me anymore. Milo, you won’t even look me in the eyes.” 

I swallowed another sob, choking on the question before it could reveal itself, a snake’s head protruding through my lips. 

“Are you seeing someone?”

He stayed silent for a long moment, and in that moment, I realized, my chest aching, that I was losing him. Then he turned. 

His eyes were hollow, and a wide, fake smile stretched across his face. 

“Darling,” he said, his tone sardonic and splintered, like he didn’t mean that word. 

Like he never meant it. 

Like it was all a game to him. Milo used to say “Darling” like he meant it; like he loved me. 

It was never an attempt to win me back or get his way. He said, “Darling,” when he was tracing my torso in bed or making me morning coffee when I was sleep deprived. The imposter wearing my husband’s face leaned against the sink, arms folded, one eyebrow cocked. 

To my surprise, he smiled, but it wasn’t the smile I fell in love with. 

I had no idea who the fuck I married, but it wasn’t Milo St. Claire. 

“Would you like to play seven minutes in heaven?”

Scooping up our baby, I stumbled to my feet. 

“You’re kidding,” I said, nursing Mara against my chest. I wanted to shout at him. Fuck, I wanted to scream at him.  He'd been body snatched. Clearly. 

Milo St Clair wasn't this… bumbling fucking idiot who couldn't even change a diaper.

“Our marriage is falling apart.” I gritted through a hysterical laugh. 

Maybe I was losing my mind. Laughing felt better. 

It felt like lukewarm water trickling across my bare skin. “I’m actually starting to ask myself why I married you in the first place.” 

My chest was heaving, my throat bitter with every word. “Why was I so stupid? You disappear every day and refuse to look after our daughter, and then you finally come home and want to play a kids’ game?”

I marched over to the sink and shut off the tap. “A game we played fifteen years ago,” I snapped. Then I turned to him, my heart aching. “I asked you a simple question, and you’re stalling. Are you sleeping with someone?” 

He rolled his eyes. “I've never…” his cheeks bloomed red. “I’ve never slept with anyone.”

“I’m your wife!” I shrieked. “What are you *talking* about? You have a daughter!” I fought back a scream. When I got an eyeroll in response, I couldn’t hold myself back. “Is it fucking Annabelle?”

He frowned. “Who?” 

“Annbelle Tate!” I hissed. “I know she watches you through the hole in her fence when you're cleaning your car.” I filled Mara’s bottle, my hands shaking. 

I dropped the lid twice before screwing it on. 

“So, what, am I not good enough for you?” I sputtered. “Your wife? You gave Annabelle Tate a good peep-show when you hosed down your car, but you can’t even sleep in the same bed as me?”

Milo’s eyes darkened, his lips curling. He folded his arms. “Then why did you marry me?” he asked bluntly.

His question landed like a gunshot. Right between my ribs, ripping through my heart.

“What?”

“Why did you marry me?” he repeated.  “Come on. Tell me why you married me, Kana.”

“I’m not doing this.” I moved for the door, but he blocked my way.

Milo came close, so close, backing me against the sodden countertop.

His lips brushed mine before his breath warmed my ear. 

“Pretend to kiss me,” he hissed against my lips, his eyes somehow elsewhere, flicking back and forth, almost like he was searching for something. 

Milo’s head tipped back, his eyes glued to every corner of the ceiling. 

Milo had been so distant, so invisible in my life, I forgot what he felt like. Tasted like. 

This was my husband, a man I knew like the back of my hand, and yet how did I fail to know that his lips tasted like sour lemon candies and stale coffee? 

How did I forget where I buried my head in the crook of his shoulder? 

“Just keep kissing me, all the way to the bedroom. You don’t need to actually kiss me, just play along,” 

His voice was a parasite bleeding into my skull.

“How?” I hissed, but obeyed, smushing my lips against his chin. “Is this some kind of role-playing game?”

Milo scrunched up his face. “What? No! Just play along.” His eyes found mine. 

Brown and warm, endless coffee grounds with golden flecks bleeding around the rim. “Trust me, okay?”

He exhaled in my face, pulling me into a clumsy embrace. 

“Please,” he said loudly this time, as if speaking to someone I couldn’t see. 

I noticed he was guiding me gently toward our bedroom, his steps smooth, as if we were performing a waltz. 

I stumbled, and he quickly helped me up. “Just one game of Seven Minutes in Heaven.” He whispered. “Exactly like we used to play in school. We ask three questions each. Three answers. No strings attached.”

I found myself being drawn closer to him, my breath stuck in my throat. “What about Mara?”

His smile took me off guard. Devilish. “Leave it.”

I did. I left our daughter sleeping on the couch and gave in to desire. 

Reaching our bedroom and stumbling over the threshold, we paused in front of the bed, frozen and breathless, staring at each other as if we didn’t know what to do. 

Then it hit like ice water; we *didn’t* know what we were doing. I tried. 

I kissed him, and he kissed back, but it felt suffocating and wrong — like I had never kissed him before, like I was kissing a fleshy mound of pink ick. When he moved closer, his warmth felt unfamiliar. I didn’t recognize it. 

The way he touched me was immature, immediately trying to cradle my hips, his fingers ticklish. “What?” Milo looked self-conscious, adjusting his hands when I burst into hysterical giggles, shoving him off of me. “Wait, am I doing it wrong?”

I had no idea how to answer because the truth was, I didn't know what I was doing either. 

I had squeezed out a baby after trying for months, and somehow, my arms around him felt like limp noodles. 

When I tried to undo his collar, I accidentally smacked him in the face. 

He looked offended for a moment, one hand cradling his nose, his usually stoic façade splintered, before he let out an explosive laugh. 

I laughed too, caught between hysterical gasps and trying to stop his nosebleed. Suddenly, everything seemed so stupid. 

The fight. 

Mara. 

Even being intimate. 

Instead of us doing anything, Milo just held me awkwardly while my cheeks erupted.

It was as if my body didn’t know or understand what to do, even though we had already conceived a child. 

We had already had sex. 

I remembered him pulling me upstairs, both of us laughing, tipsy from wine, carrying me into our bedroom, and dropping me onto the bed, his lips kissing all the way down my neck, trailing down my torso. So, what happened to him? 

Why did he seem so foreign, so alien? 

Like he wasn’t even my husband? 

More importantly, what happened to *me*?

Eventually, Milo pulled away, eyes half lidded. 

Glassy. 

I couldn’t help but notice his hands stuck to my waist, as if he were playing a role. 

Acting. 

""Wait,"" he whispered, pressing his index finger to his lips. 

He pulled me closer, his breath tickling my face. “I think there’s someone outside.”

“What?” I squeaked, immediately shoving him away. I was still fully dressed, but I felt exposed, even behind closed doors.

Milo didn’t speak, took my hand, and dragged me to the window. 

Before he could pull back the curtains, a voice startled us both, and I fell back, almost tripping over my feet. “I’ve got a cheese and tomato pizza for Mrs. Kana St. Claire?” a male voice shouted from outside. “Anyone there?”

I turned to Milo, my heart pounding. I told him I was cooking dinner. Milo even had the leftovers.

So, why…?

I shook my head, swallowing questions smothering my tongue. “Did you order pizza?”

Milo’s lips curled, his gaze flicking upward, expression faltering. He squeezed his eyes shut and exhaled. His grip on my shoulders tightened. 

“Yes,” he said softly, breaking out into an explosive grin. His eyes flew open. “Yes, of course I did! I ordered you pizza as an apology.”

I noticed the twitch in his eye, the furrow between his brows.

He was acting again.

Before I could question his sudden behavior, he leaned in close, his breath tickling my ear. 

“Better go get your pizza, *honey*,” he hummed, his tone unmistakably icy. “Before it gets cold.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but our daughter’s delightful giggling cut me off. Milo rolled his eyes. 

His expression darkened, and his eyes suddenly looked far too hollow. 

I was in denial at this point. What glittered in my husband’s eyes was resentment. Hatred. 

He despised our daughter and wasn’t even trying to hide it. He shoved past me, not before hissing in my ear, “If you don’t shut that thing up, I will.”

I caught his shoulder before he could stalk off. “You mean your *daughter*,” I said. “I’m exhausted. You take her to bed.”

He jerked around, wide eyes and twisted lips. 

He was crying. I could feel him shuddering, his entire body trembling under my touch. “Don’t make me do it,” Milo whispered, pleading. “Please.”

We didn’t speak again that night. 

Milo disappeared when I put Mara to bed. I ate cold pizza in silence and went to bed pretending not to hear my husband resign to the couch downstairs.

It was difficult to come to terms with a lot of things. The first one was that my husband wasn’t my husband anymore.

Milo had always been a great dad. Now it was like living with a body snatcher. 

Ever since that night when I got the slightest reaction from him, maybe even the start of an explanation, he had completely shut down. 

Milo used to care about our child. 

Now, he went to work and came home and ate dinner with dead eyes and a weird, forced smile, like he wasn’t given a choice to become a father. 

Like this wasn’t what he wanted; like I fucking forced him to refill bottles (the bare minimum) or take turns with me at night to settle her laughing. 

Milo had made it very fucking clear he hated being a father. 

I gave him the choice. 

Fifteen months ago, I knelt in front of him with a twisting stomach and vomit crawling up my throat and said, “I’m pregnant.”

A pregnancy test clutched in his fist and tears glistening in his eyes, Milo burst into tears and promised me it was exactly what he wanted — a mini version of the two of us running around, our own child.  

The thing about men is they will fucking lie. They think they know what they want, but do they? 

Do they really want to lose their sleep schedule? 

Do they really want to be sleep deprived? 

Do they REALLY want a child, or just a pet? 

It had taken me a while being in denial, but I realized I was right. Milo didn’t want a daughter. 

He didn’t even want to be a father.

When I invited friends over for lunch a few days later, I expected him to hide away like usual. 

But Milo was surprisingly present.

While I caught up with our friends, my husband sat on the arm of our couch with one leg crossed over the other. 

I had friends over every week, and usually, Milo either joined in or went MIA while we reminisced and got too drunk on fruity wine. Karina and Simon were old-school friends, both with their own little one—Holden, who was almost six months old.

He and Mara played in the lounge while we had our grown-up time.  

Milo was drinking beer, I noticed, which wasn’t good. 

He wasn’t usually a drinker, so when he appeared with a can of beer, I braced myself for more stupid behavior.  

He didn’t disappoint. 

Sitting like a detective interrogating a perp, Milo stared down our friends. 

“Karina, it’s nice to see you,” Milo spoke up out of nowhere, while we were on the topic of baby clothes. He nodded at Simon, his eyes narrowed. 

“Simon.” Speaking with his lips to his beer can, a weird smirk on his lips, I had a feeling he was going to be weird again. 

I shot him a warning look, which he, of course, ignored. Milo grinned, downing his beer. I caught Simon’s side-eye. He was *embarrassing* us. “This is a completely normal and not-at-all-weird question, but how exactly did you meet Karina?”

The two of them looked confused, but Karina was happy to answer. Optimistic as usual, wearing a sunshine smile with silky dark hair pulled into a ponytail. Karina Crawford was my best friend. 

Karina saluted my husband with her glass and a light laugh. 

“I’m pretty sure you know this, babes,” she winked at Milo. 

“Simon and I met during college. I was studying astrophysics, and he was writing a book,” she shot her husband a grin. 

“I was stubborn at first! Simon was the complete opposite of me. I mean, I was like a total control freak! I was a model student. I had my college life perfectly planned out, and a boy was never part of the plan—""

“And I was planning on dropping out to write,” Simon finished for her. 

“Luckily, our paths crossed. She was looking for a specific class, and I just happened to be writing on the steps.”

“It was love at first sight.” Karina sighed. She sipped her glass. 

“Just like a fairytale! It was like fate. I saw him, and I realized my perfectly meticulous plan had gone completely out the window.” 

She settled Simon with heart eyes that I was envious of, and I caught Milo subtly pretending to gag. “For a guy I barely even knew! I was seriously going to take a chance on a stranger, and it's like…” Karina trailed off suddenly, her expression faltering, like she was going to say something. 

Instead of speaking, she went silent, her gaze wavering behind my husband.

Milo leaned forward, his eyes wide. “It’s like….?”

Karina blinked. “Hmm?” She giggled, waving her glass. “Sorry! I…” Karina shook her head, pushing waves of dark curls from her face. “I apologize! I… think I’ve had too much wine.”

“No, you were talking about your college days.” Milo pushed, still perched on the edge of the chair arm. “Tell us more.” He leaned back, arms folded. 

“You’re married. Congratulations!” His smile was as fake as his attitude. “Sooo, when were you married? What date did you guys tie the knot?”

“Milo,” I managed through my teeth. I sent him another warning look, and he just shot me the thumbs up.

“No, I like this game!” Karina straightened up, balancing her glass between her knees. “It was April 2nd, 2016.” She smiled brightly at me. “In a gorgeous ceremony in Japan! We were married under the cherry blossom trees in Kyoto and had our honeymoon climbing Mount Fuji, and ummm—”

I smiled, reaching out to grasp her hand. “That’s beautiful, Karina.”

I shot Milo a glare. “Isn't it Babe?”

Milo shrugged. “She's not finished.” 

“Honey,” Simon laughed nervously, but I detected a hint of confusion in his tone. “We were married in Bali.” He spoke confidently. “Remember? We swam with the dolphins in crystal blue water, and you got food poisoning from bad shellfish. The wedding was outside on this beach with perfect white sand, and you kept complaining about the grains in your shoes.”

Karina’s expression twisted for a moment, like she was going to protest, before her lips broke out into a grin.

“Oh, yeah!” she laughed. “Yes, it was Bali! Not Japan! Oh my gosh, I’m like, so drunk, I can’t even remember when I was married!” She grinned at me. “Aren’t I like, the funniest drunk?”

Milo laughed along with her. “Hilarious,” he said. And continued to push. 

I gave in to temptation and threw one of Mara’s socks at his face, but he was barely fazed. 

Milo kept going. “Okay, so Karina, since you’re so fucking hilarious, what about your little bundle of *joy*?” Milo said, his tone darkening. “When was he born, hmm? Little Holden! You know! Your son!”

“Milo, *stop*,” I told him. I stood up, plonking my glass down on the coffee table. “That’s enough.”

“Why? I’m just asking them basic questions that literally every couple should know.” 

He turned to our friends. “Go on! If you’re sooooo in love, you should know when your baby was born.”

“March 8th,"" Karina said, at the same time as Simon piped up with, “June 3rd.”

The two of them looked momentarily horrified before Karina burst into tears.

Milo’s lips pricked into a smirk. “How about the first time you had sex? I  bet that was a memorable night.”

“That’s highly inappropriate—” I started to say.

“On her parents' sofa,” Simon said.

“It was at a hotel!” Karina shot back.

Milo didn’t even have to continue. Karina stood up, her legs wobbling, tears streaming down her cheeks. “What was the name of the song we danced to at our wedding? “she demanded.

Simon smiled. “Easy. The Power of Love.”

Karina stalked over to him in three unsteady steps, slapping him across the face. “You asshole! It was Kate Bush! My Mom’s favorite song!”

Milo nodded, enjoying the chaos. “So, in conclusion, you two can’t remember your wedding day or the day your child was born!” He mockingly shrugged. “I don’t know about you guys,” he said, his tone dripping with sarcasm, ""but I’d say that’s a pretty healthy relationship.”

My friends ignored him, deep in their own marital problems. “You don’t even know the day your own son was born?” Karina squeaked at a paling Simon. “Are you fucking kidding me?”

Simon opened his mouth. “Karina, wait—”

She left before he could finish, pulling Holden from the playpen in the living room and slamming the door behind her.

After sitting in silence for a long, awkward minute, Simon dove to his feet, following her.

When our friends were gone, I was speechless. 

I scooped a still-giggling Mara from her playpen and cleared up empty glasses. 

Milo didn’t move or speak, just sitting there still perched on the chair arm. 

Almost triumphant.

“What is wrong with you?” I finally exploded on him, nursing Mara against my chest. 

“Did you think that was some joke? What was it, mind games? On our friends?  What can I even say, Milo? Mental health? Should I say my husband has been fucking stolen away and body snatched?”

I choked back a laugh when he didn’t respond, mumbling something under his breath.

“What?” I spun around. “What do you want to say, Milo? Say it to my face. We’re married, remember?”

I choked back a sob I knew was coming. “Or did you forget that?”

Milo’s head snapped up, lips curling. “I said, do *you* want to play?”

He strode over until we were inches apart—nose to nose. I couldn’t breathe suddenly, terrified of his next words. Was this it? Was he going to end it? 

Was he finally going to come clean about his clear affair with Anabelle Tate? 

Milo wasn’t smiling. He folded his arms. There was something about the way he looked at me, not like a lover or a husband. Cruel. Calculating. 

Like I was a problem he was trying to solve. 

Was he always like this? 

How did I never see this? 

The furrow between his eyebrows and the squint in his eyes signified he needed glasses.

Four words. Four words that sent me spiraling, my legs wobbling underneath me. Milo’s lips moved, and at first his words didn’t register. Like white noise. “Where were we married, Kana?”

I blinked. “What?”

“Our marriage,” he said coldly. “Where were we married?”

Easy.

I knew it.

New York.

City landscapes, towering golden chandeliers, and a church sitting under a perfect sunny blue sky.

No. I shook my head.

No, it was Iceland.

We stayed in an ice hotel and watched the aurora borealis. I married Milo in a dress made of fake animal fur.

No!

New Zealand!

We got married on a—on a beach! Yes, that was it. I could visualize it. Perfect, clear water under a dark sky where we conceived Mara.

I swallowed a frustrated screech when, somehow, each location slipped my mind, like sand falling through my fingers. He was playing mind games that I was immediately falling for.

“I’ll ask you a question,” I said, a shiver running down my spine, our marriage running through my head. I believed I knew everything about it; I had scrapbooked the entire experience.

I knew the location, what kind of dress I wore, and my tearful speech. 

But trying to pull all of these memories to the forefront of my mind was agonizing, like I knew they were there, but I couldn’t reach them; my mind felt empty, cavernous. Wrong. So fucking wrong, like it wasn’t even mine. 

Like I was a stranger. All those memories I thought I had fallen in love with; I thought they would stay with me forever. Gone. 

The words tangled on my tongue and were lost. But I couldn’t admit that. I couldn’t let Milo know he’d won. “I want to know something.”

Milo raised a brow. “Shoot.”

“What happened to you?” I whispered. “What *happened* to my husband?”

Milo smiled, but it was tragic, painful, like he was finally letting go, which squeezed my heart. He stayed silent for a moment, shut his eyes tight, a tear slowly rolling down his cheek.

“New York,” Milo whispered, his sob splintering into a giggle. He reached forward, tucking a strand of my hair behind my ear, and somehow I found myself leaning into his touch.

“I thought it was New York too.” His hand slipped, as if he was gathering himself. “For the longest time, I had this… image of you,” he said. 

“You were wearing this beautiful white dress, Kana. And it was supposed to be the happiest day of my life—the day I married you.” 

He broke down suddenly, swiping at raw eyes. “When our daughter was born, I could see you so clearly. You were exhausted, red-faced, and demanding that I get you some soda. Mara was this tiny bundle in your arms that you wouldn’t let me hold until I washed my hands.” 

He laughed, and I did too, tears filling my eyes. The images flitted through my mind. 

Everything he was describing, I saw it.  

“I had this… this perfect picture in my head of our wedding, our daughter’s birth, and moving into this house.” 

Milo’s smile faded. He stepped away from me, arms wrapped around himself. 

“Then I woke up,” he whispered. “And I realized I didn’t want *any*of it.” 

His laugh was explosive. 

“I’m too young to be a father, dude. I’m too young to be a husband! And if I’m totally honest? I can’t stand that thing’s laughing! It’s driving me insane!”

Something hot scalded my throat, burning under my tongue. “That’s your *daughter*,” I said stiffly.

I tried to be patient, tried to see his side. This man was seriously dropping to his knees and telling me he didn’t want to be a fucking adult.

“You’re thirty-nine, Milo.” I gritted out. “We’ve been married for almost ten years.”

His expression twisted, lips twitching into a smile. “All right, fine, *Kana*,” he growled. 

Milo gripped my hands, his clammy fingers stabbing into my skin. “Where *were* we married?”

A vicious myriad of colors bled across my mind.

New York.

Iceland.

New Zealand—

I shook it away.

“What’s *that* got to do with anything?” I hissed. “You’re regretting marrying me and want to go back to being single, and what, you have this fantasy of living alone in a one-bedroom apartment?” I shoved him. Hard. “You’re a married man with a baby girl. Get a grip.”

His eyes darkened. “If you want me to show you, I will,” he murmured. “I’m not scared anymore.”

I laughed. “Show me what? Scared of *what*? Your inability to handle simple responsibilities?”

“That’s not what I—""

Mara’s sudden loud giggling cut into our argument, the lights flickering. I stepped back, taking a deep breath. “Mara’s awake.” I rushed to grab her blankie and bottle. “Do not go anywhere,” I told him. 

“Stay there. Don’t move. I’m going to settle our daughter, and then we’re going to talk.”

But we didn’t talk. 

We never fucking talked. 

We always avoided it. 

I fed Mara her bottle and, when she was asleep, headed back downstairs. Milo was curled up on the couch watching TV.

I grabbed some juice for myself and leaned against the kitchen countertop. “What are you watching?” I asked.

“Minecraft Movie,” he mumbled, his face smushed into a pillow.

“You’re not serious,” I said, downing my glass. The juice was weirdly lukewarm. “I downloaded that for Mara.”

Milo didn’t turn around, burying his head in the chair arm. “It’s good. You just don’t understand Minecraft lore.”

“Fascinating,” I said, and the lights flickered again. “I’m going to bed.”

Milo didn’t respond.

In the middle of the night, we were once again startled awake by our daughter’s relentless laughter. The more I tried to bury my head in my pillows, the louder it became. Mara was restless.

I checked the bedside clock.

4am.

Milo rolled over in bed. I noticed he’d left a gap between us, wedging a pillow between him and me.

Ouch.

“You sort it,” he grumbled, burrowing under the blankets. “I’m not going near that thing.”

My husband’s words rolled off me as I jumped out of bed and forced a grin. I had to be happy Mommy.

Even when I felt like collapsing, when I stumbled, unsteady and dizzy, I couldn’t let my daughter see sad mommy.

Wandering into our daughter’s room, I scooped up little Mara and rested her against my chest. 

She laughed louder, piercing my ears. I had to bite back a shriek. 

“You know,” I hummed, rocking her in my arms. Her big blue eyes stared at me, lips breaking into a big cheesy grin. “Your laughing is so cute,” I cooed. “But you’re keeping your Mommy and Daddy awake all night.”

“Kana,” Milo shouted from our bedroom. “Just fucking leave it!”

When I climbed back into bed after spending an hour nursing our daughter to sleep, I swore I could hear my husband’s muffled sobs.

The next morning, Milo was standing in front of the coffee machine in his robe, staring at the wall. He didn't drink the coffee. He dumped it down the sink. Then refilled another cup.

Mara was giggling while I was trying to feed her breakfast. I had custard pudding all over my jeans.

Mara really didn’t want any, shaking her head and insisting on sticking her fingers in the goop. I tried the airplane method.

“Say ahhhh,” I waved the spoon in front of her, but Mara just laughed. Behind me, Milo dropped his cup into the sink with a loud clatter.

Milo surprised me by letting out a sudden hysterical laugh. He refilled another cup. “I can’t take this anymore.”

“Meaning?” I didn’t look away from our daughter, shoveling yellow goop into her giggling smile.

He lurched forward, snatching Mara from my arms.

My hands felt empty, suddenly, words tangling on my tongue. 

No. 

“I’m sick of this thing,” he spat, dangling Mara upside down. “I’m so tired of it!”

I froze, my lips parted in a scream as my husband ripped our daughter’s head from her torso, and I screamed as blood ran thick down his arms and pooled on the floor. Milo didn't stop.

He ripped off her legs, then her arms. I watched him, unable to move, unable to scream, my jaw arching, my stomach lurching. “I can't take it anymore!” Milo cried, and I dropped to my knees, cradling little Mara’s torso. Milo followed me, his eyes red raw. 

“Listen to me,” he whispered.  

When I screamed at him, babbling as vomit filled my throat, he yanked me down with him. “Fucking LISTEN to me!” I refused to listen. I couldn’t. 

Mara’s blood stained me like paint, ingrained into every part of me. He killed our daughter. 

He murdered our child!

“It's not *real*!” He dangled white stuffing in front of me, and for the first time, color bled across my vision. I blinked rapidly. Milo grabbed my face, jerking me to face him.

“Kana. Look at me. I *know* you’re in there. It’s not real. I'm not your husband, we are not fucking married, we’re nineteen years old! The stupid doll was laughing because the batteries needed changing!” I followed his gaze, my arms dropping limply to my sides—white stuffing.

I stared down at what was in my lap---

A doll.

A doll with its arms and legs torn off, a doll wearing a wide laughing grin smeared with custard pudding.

There was no blood.

For the first time, I looked at him. Really looked at him.

Messy brown curls, freckles, and definitely not a thirty-nine-year-old man. I stared down at myself.

And I wasn’t a forty-year-old woman.

Milo covered my mouth when a cry escaped my throat. “I'm Milo Reyes!” he hissed. I sat behind you in English for three years! I’ve spoken to you maybe once because you lent me a pencil.

He pulled me to my feet, dragging me toward the door. “None of this is real,” he whispered, choking on a sob. 

“Outside, there’s a government compound. It’s... It’s like a huge metal bunker made to look like a suburban neighborhood, and we’re stuck here!” he hissed. “You, me, Simon, and Karina.” He looked away. “Your boyfriend, too, Kana. Our whole damn class!”

He grabbed my shoulders, shaking me. I barely felt it. My brain was dancing. 

I was still staring at my daughter. 

“Do you remember the birth crisis?” he whispered. Billions of babies across the country were dying. It was on the news, and they… they said they had a solution—""

“Mr. St. Clair.” A voice crackled from above. Milo’s head snapped up, his eyes widening.

“Fuck!”

The voice was familiar, somehow. I knew it.

Milo St. Clair, please exit Forever Home 15 and pick up your new child to restart the simulation. Failure to comply with the Family First Law will result in you and your wife being executed.”

Milo turned to me, his eyes frenzied. “Stay here, okay?”

I stumbled to my feet, falling over myself. Somehow,  my mouth opened. “No—”

“It’s okay, *wife*, I’m the one who disobeyed them.” Milo pulled me into a hug. “I’ll go get my punishment.”

His lips found my ear, his breath dancing across my neck. “I’m getting the fuck out of here. I’ll come back for you when I find a way out, all right?” he pulled me closer. “I’ll get all of you out.”

“Mr St. Clair, we can *hear* you,” the voice crackled again. “Please exit Forever Home 15 and pick up a new child to restart the simulation. Failure to comply with the Family First Law will result in your and your wife’s execution. I repeat. Please exit Forever Home 15 and pick up a new—”

“I’ve got it!” he snapped, pulling away from me. I followed my “husband” to the front door.

When he left, slamming it behind him, I tried to open it myself. 

To my surprise, I stumbled right out into a sunny morning, onto our perfectly manicured lawn. 

I dropped to my knees and plucked a single blade, rolling it around my palm. 

Fake. 

I plucked a whole bunch. 

Plastic. Plastic fucking grass.

“Kana St. Clair,” the female voice came through loud and clear when I was crawling through the yard digging up fake dirt. “Please return to your Forever Home and await your husband and child.”

I found my voice, tinged with vomit. “What if I don’t?” I asked the sky. “What if I refuse?”

There was no response for a moment.

“Then you and your husband will be executed.”

I stepped back inside our house and did what I always did. I made coffee—one for me and one for Milo.

I cooked dinner: spaghetti and meatballs.

Our silverware was plastic, I noticed, as I dug into my spaghetti. Our glasses and plates were all plastic.

“So, who are you?” I asked the ceiling, cutting into my spaghetti. My stomach twisted. I was already cutting it up for my daughter—who wasn’t real. “Why can I recognize your voice?”

No response.

I picked up my plastic knife and stabbed it into my wrist. “What would you do if I sliced open my arms?”

“That’s not possible with a plastic knife, Kana,” the voice mused.

I laughed.

And then I slammed my head against the table until I was bleeding, until my head ached, but at least I wasn’t thinking about Mara.

The front door opened and then shut, and reality slammed into me at the sound of a baby’s wails.

“Honey.” Milo’s voice swam from the hallway in a sing-song. I dived to my feet. “I’m home!”

“Milo.”

I ran, stumbling over myself, slamming straight into my husband standing on the threshold. Another grotesque plastic doll was nestled in his arms. But his eyes were distant. Empty.

He held the doll close to his chest, smiling broadly. Milo looked up at me and whispered, “Isn't she beautiful?” Behind him, a tiny red light on the door blinked at me. Milo laughed, gently booping the doll on the nose and rocking her against his chest. 

“She’s our little Mara.” 

He smiled up at me, and I could see blood vessels burst in his eyes, burn marks on his left temple. 

“She has your eyes, Kana!” he gently prodded the doll’s plastic cheek. “Look!”

“Kana St Clair.” The voice spoke up when Milo carried the doll into the kitchen for feeding time. 

I watched him robotically fill up the bottle, settling Mara into her chair. 

I felt dizzy as I walked over to him and tried to shake him,  but his eyes were glassy. Unseeing. 

It wasn’t my Milo. “You have a choice,” the voice said. “You can either comply with the rules and restart the simulation from the beginning, or you and your husband will be executed immediately.”

Milo began to sing softly, rocking the doll in his arms.

“Hush little baby, don’t you cry

Daddy’s here to sing you a lullaby

If the moonlight fades away

I’ll bring you sunshine for your day—”

“No,” I whispered, choking on a sob. Pain struck like a lightning bolt in the back of my head. 

The door burst open, and men with guns surrounded us. 

Milo didn’t move when a gun was stuck into the back of his head. I blinked back tears and squeezed my eyes shut. “No. We won’t.”

Cruel metal found the back of my skull, and I dropped to my knees.

“Very well,” the voice said.

“If your toy should break or fall,” Milo continued in a low hum, as my thoughts began to fade, and his singing became all that I knew.

My mantra is to slow down. Breath. This has helped in many ways. It's let me zoom out of myself. Out of time and place to see from a more historical perspective. 

It brings comfort to me knowing there is a cycle to what we are. The earth itself will continue to change along with all the life it holds. It's plates and waves moving differently every few millennia. Changing in ways we think we understand. So they say.

Maybe it's from watching One Battle After Another and seeing their generations passing the torch of freedom fighter but with no real progress. Everyone searching for power, being drawn to it. They crave it even if it means sacrificing themselves just to get a taste. 

I don't assume the end of life. I definitely predict it though. That makes it easy to not think in that direction. The end of that book is not very interesting. I run off the idea that everyone lives in their own reality. We fight to understand, but it's okay when we don't. Many people don't know plenty of things. I'd like to think if there is a multiverse, everyone lives in theirs where their lives are the longest. Those we see pass early in our reality are off in their own still where all their choices led them to a better path, and we only saw a version of it. 

So I keep on going. I try my best to be good, not for a higher power, but because it's the right thing to do. Living in the past can change passed on the perspective of the present. The future can be bright for many reasons and hopefully without too much heat with the light.

Hey everyone, I’m a 26 y/o guy moving to Nashville soon and coming from the DC area. Super excited for the change and wanted to ask for any tips, and general Nashville “things I should know” before the move.

Also figured I’d put myself out there and try to meet some people. I’m really into working out (lifting, cardio, anything active), love traveling, play pickup basketball whenever I can, and I’m a huge foodie. Always down to try new spots, coffee shops, or hole-in-the-wall places.

If anyone’s into the same stuff or has recommendations for gyms, courts, basketball runs, or food, I’d love to hear it. Also open to meeting up once I’m settled.

Feel free to comment or DM me. Happy to swap Instagrams too.

Appreciate any advice, and looking forward to calling Nashville home.",1,1767617682.0,VisitingNashville,1,1.0,False

# ✍️ Rachel's Personal Experience

A good friend of mine, *Rachel T*, borrowed the [21-Day Keto Reset](https://theworldhealth.org/21-day-keto-reset-official) from me after we were chatting about quick weekday dinners over coffee one afternoon.

She’s a freelance illustrator who works crazy hours and told me she was tired of bouncing between keto YouTubers and random blogs that contradicted each other.

Her goal was simple: fewer sugar crashes, more brain power, and maybe fitting back into her favorite jacket before autumn.

She started the plan that weekend and messaged me two days later saying she actually looked forward to opening her fridge — which, from Rachel, is high praise.

What she loved was the fact that it's **a step-by-step keto plan with meals and a shopping list.** Nothing is left to chance. She said the lack of calorie tracking gave her “mental breathing room.”

Her only complaint? One of the recipes included capers, and she’d sooner eat paper. But that’s Rachel — dramatic about briny things. She swapped it out, carried on, and by the end of the 21 days, she’d not only lost five pounds but claimed her focus while drawing had improved, too.

“It’s like someone cleaned up the junk drawer in my brain,” she told me.

Not bad for three weeks and a grocery list.

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. EmZee - Addicted To You [GXLD RECORDS]**  
*Recommended if you like: Prdk, Absu_NTQL, Zigi SC*  

Happy new year! To wake you up from that food coma of yours, why not indulge in the fine art of Czech Neurofunk? Let's talk about **EmZee**!

**1.1. EmZee Hammer (2021 - 2026)**

While Matěj Zápotocký is not the kind of artist that has revealed his whole life story in interviews or online posts, with even his artist bio just stating ""No words needed"", I still want to take a moment to paint a picture of the young'un. Straight out of Jesenice, south of Prague, this Czechian talent has been causing a stir since about 2021, when he first remixed the theme song of Czechoslovak animated series _Pat & Mat_ into rather filthy Jump Up. While the filth very much stayed, he quickly pivoted to the kinds of harder sounds you would perhaps more expect from the region he's from - Neurofunk. 

As **EmZee**, or **eMZee**, he not only remixed more childhood bangers from _Spongebob_, _South Park_ (Czech Dub, of course) and bed time story program _Vecernicek_, and bootlegged the likes of _BADBOYBERLIN_, _REDZED_, and _Dirtyphonics & Bossfight_, he also unleashed his debut EP _Disaster_ onto the world, all in 2023. At a truly ridiculous pace, he continued Matějking over the Neuro underground scenes, one tune at a time: Multiple outings on _DnB Doctor_, _GXLD_, and _Bass Rabbit_, one-offs on _NONOISE_, _Raving Panda_, _UTM_ (RIP), and _NeuroDNB_, collaborations with _Sk3ngz_, _Phakan_, _Bullet_, _Cotsu_, and _Unknown_, and bootlegs of _Confusion_, _Absu_NTQL_, and the one and only _Lucie Bílá_ - fun fact, I actually saw someone walking around at Let It Roll with a shirt that had a thug life edit of Lucie on it. Anyway. All of that? That was _just 2024_! I always write down everything an artist has released over the years before starting to write any sentences out of it, and his bullet point list of releases was literally the longest I've _ever_ had for a single year. Genuinely insane. As if not satisfied with that though, '25 saw him chuck out a similar avalanche of awesomeness, on the likes of _NeuroSession_, _Neuroheadz_, _Neurofunk, What Else?_, and _GXLD_, working with names like _Yimura_, _NATT_, and _Lil Fault_, running a _Patreon_, and adding _The Prodigy_ and _Linkin Park_ to his bootleggery hall of fame. 

**1.2. Addicted To You**

As soon as the clock turned midnight on New Years Eve last week, Matěj already delivered the first banger of 2026: **Addicted To You**. In the mists of futuristic melodic vibes, Mr. EmZee brings in the titular vocal right at the very first second, pushing it through the deep bass clouds swinging left and right through 3d space until they turn into fine, 8th note vocal-chop dust. With all of our main ingredients now laid out in front of us, we launch into attack mode: hectic drums, thoroughly distorted basslines, and vocals dancing on top of it all might seem like plenty of action, but they are merely the first act of a two-act back-and-forth, with the second half bringing out a lethal combination of piercing stabs, plonky snares and the sharp vocal chops from earlier. 

**1.3. Conclusion**

An incredibly satisfying fusion of the melodic, techy vibes of the modern era and the in-your-face energy of Czech Neurofunk - rather Ma-tějsty! 

Other Neurofunk from this week:  
- Prdk - DREAMER (!)  
- MNTL - Rock In Roll Race  
- XAETIS - Immediacy  

---

####**2. Coffee Shop Jungle, Makoto - Cuillier [CSJ]**  
*Recommended if you like: A Little Espressound, Tea and Sugar, Latte*  

The main good thing about these slower few weeks of releases, aside from us just getting a bit of a break from it all, is that it allows me to take a look at things that might get buried in a busier week. So, let's talk coffee!

**2.1. Coffee Shop Jungle (2022 - 2026)**

Roughly three and a half years ago now, **Coffee Shop Jungle** started rolling out tunes every single week that combined the modern trend of shorter track lengths with an idea that has already been spoiled by the name they've chosen for the project: relaxing, instrumental Liquid rollers, i.e. DnB music that could be played at coffee shops! I guess _Coffee Shop Liquid_ doesn't roll off the tongue quite as elegantly. There is not a whole lot known about the project, other than the people at the _DJ Zinc_'s very own _Bingo Bass_ imprint apparently having something to do with it. While a lot of the tunes are just fully credited all the way through to just CSJ themselves, some of them also explicitly feature Mr Zinc himself, with the likes of **Makoto**, _Pure_, _Jack Ruby_, _Horizontal_, _Hibiki_, _Animated Peach Farm_, and even _CPTL PNSHMNT_ occassionally appearing as a feature. Sometimes even without the main name itself attached to it, but always with that steamy pixelated mug of theirs.

**2.2. Cuillier**

Throughout its now 130+ tunes, they have honoured their favourite coffee shops all over the world, gave shout-outs to their promoter friends, released actual EPs and albums, ran out of colours to choose from, and supplied us with a steady stream of lovely background noise - and I want to honour that dedication, by taking a look at their first 2026 offering, **Cuillier**!

Featuring none other than **Makoto**, under his full government name for some reason, this sub-two-minuter quickly establishes its lead in layers one and two, before fully kicking off the smoothly rolling, synth-enhanced, one-two-three bubbler that is the main attraction here. Despite the short runtime and the by-design simplicity, we are still treated to a rather satisfying progression that adds distant reverberations of all sorts of other layers to the mix, but that's where this Espresshort journey already ends. As the French title implies, this is just a spoonful of goodness, but don't you worry, there's way more where this comes from!

**2.3. Conclusion**

Exactly what you need on this first Monday of the year. Smooth, bubbly, and probably improves your health in various ways.

ich habe ein Problem mit meiner CoffeeB (Café royal) Kapsel-Maschine und komme langsam nicht mehr weiter.

Ich habe das Gerät bereits komplett auseinander geschraubt und mir alles von innen angeschaut. Mein Verdacht ist, dass irgendwo Luft im Schlauch oder im Bereich vom Wassertank bzw. der Pumpe steckt.

Das Problem ist folgendes: Das Wasser läuft nicht dort raus, wo es eigentlich rauskommen sollte. Stattdessen läuft (sehr wenig) in den Behälter, in dem auch die Kapseln bzw. Coffee Balls landen. Dadurch kommt weder Kaffee noch Wasser aus dem Auslauf.

Ich wollte das System mit einer Spritze entlüften und Wasser hineinpumpen, das hat aber nicht funktioniert, weil man nirgends sinnvoll an einen Schlauch oder Anschluss herankommt. Entweder gibt es keinen klaren Punkt zum Öffnen oder ich habe ihn einfach nicht gefunden.

Hat jemand von euch das gleiche Problem schon mal gehabt oder eine Idee, wie man das Teil entlüften kann?
Gibt es einen Trick, eine bestimmte Stelle oder einen Workaround, den ich übersehe?

Bin für jeden Hinweis dankbar, bevor das Ding endgültig auf dem Elektroschrott landet.

Danke euch!

1q4ks98,https://i.redd.it/j29j0sq51jbg1.jpeg,"Like a boat that had run aground, we were well and truly stuck...","Good morning! Ah yes—the Monday after the holidays. The day when many people trudge back to school or work, clutching coffee and wondering where the last two weeks went. As one of the self-employed, however, there is no such thing as a true day off. Not a complete one, anyway. There are merely days with fewer work hours. Still, the first Monday of the new year always feels like the moment when it’s time to buckle down and return to Real Life. After all, the holidays tend to be filled with celebration, time with loved ones, and for some, even a vacation. When the merriment ends, the return to routine can feel more than a little anticlimactic.

Unless, of course, your vacation included a trip like this...

My (now ex) husband and I spent several years living in a motorhome, working in different locations as we went. Travels up and down the coast were a regular part of life. Then there was this particular road trip...

For starters, we learned that having plenty of tread on your tires is not always enough to guarantee smooth sailing. Apparently, they were tired tires. Three of them gave up the ghost during that journey. Each familiar BANG! provided a brief moment of excitement, enlivening what would otherwise have been a dull stretch of roadway.

But the real adventure began when we exited the highway in search of fuel for our ever-thirsty rig. The motorhome was forty feet long and towed a truck, giving us a combined length of over sixty feet. Add a height of nearly fourteen feet, and fuel stops had to be chosen with care. Your average gas station simply wouldn’t do. Tight corners were a challenge, and low overhangs could quickly turn into expensive regrets.

Fortunately, we carried a book called The Next Exit, which in those days was an indispensable resource for RVers. It listed what could be found at each highway exit, with RV-friendly stops helpfully marked in red. This particular exit claimed to offer several suitable fueling options. It was Friday and commuter hour, pouring rain, and traffic was crawling along—giving us plenty of time to scout the possibilities.

We cruised slowly down the double three-lanes of road, scanning for large gas stations. Then my husband spotted a promising one across the way. It was on the left, which would also make it easier to turn around and get back on the highway quickly. A win-win, or so we thought.

Left blinker on, we began inching toward the turning lane at a convenient set of traffic lights. We hit the green light and the correct lane at the same time, and as we started the turn, I noticed something unsettling. The road in front of the gas station appeared to swell upward rather dramatically. I was immediately struck by a sense of dread.

We’re not going to clear it.

Sure enough, we didn’t. The motorhome’s long wheelbase meant that while the tires stayed firmly on the ground, the high spot in the roadway caught the midsection of the vehicle. Like a boat that had run aground, we were well and truly stuck. And there was no waiting for the tide to eventually float us free.

Not only could we move neither forward nor backward, but we were also blocking five lanes of traffic. I imagine there were quite a few people sitting in their cars, staring at us in disbelief. Some were undoubtedly less than thrilled to find themselves trapped there on a rainy Friday afternoon, when they had far better places to be.

We did have options, though. First, we unhooked the pickup and drove it into a nearby parking lot, which at least opened up one lane. Then a very kind man—who had been stuck waiting in the downpour—got out of his own truck and helped my husband with option number two. Using the RV’s hydraulic levelers, we carefully raised the ten-ton behemoth over the hump and employed the trusty 2x10s we always carried to bring the motorhome forward to freedom.

A police officer had been dispatched to the scene and began directing traffic around us. He later mentioned that this particular spot regularly snagged unwary semis, buses, and RVs, and that they usually had to call a tow truck about once a week to deal with it. He added that this was the first time he’d ever seen anyone successfully get themselves up and over the obstruction.

All I can say is thank goodness for the cheerful stranger who pitched in without hesitation, the good-natured policeman, and the patience of the other drivers—who, for a while at least, were a captive audience to our little drama.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞

He would ghost me saying he is not in a good mood and then not talk to me for days until i reached out to him and at one point i decided not to and that’s how we cut contact. He had a younger brother (27M) who studies in my university and in the same program i’ve seen him quite often. 

anyways, the guy who i was dating (x) we haven’t spoken in 3 months and i see him posting a story having dinner with some girl like couple of snaps and that infuriated me enough to stalk his little brother and became friends on FB. i never told him intention. 

after a while his brother (y) and i became friends, we would talk often and we met in uni too. he’s very open and in front with me and and we went for coffee too. he tells me his family tales that i love listening but i pretend as if i don’t know anything. i met him again too today he dropped me home from uni and even before that, we talked continuously at the cafeteria for 4 hours non stop. i realized i enjoy talking to him and he’s very sweet and fun and ive enough insight to know that he belongs to a good family (not talking about his elder brother) i think i really like him but i cannot
have anything with him bec it’ll
break his heart even tho now my intention to talk and spend time with him is purely bec i enjoy talking to him and not what it was initially.

1q4kmam,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartofMassachusetts/comments/1q4kmam/the_keeper_of_worcester/,The Keeper of Worcester,"First post here. I wanted to share a short reflection about Worcester and see if it resonates.

Worcester sits among its hills like a city that learned endurance early. Streets curve instead of complying. Brick darkened by soot still breathes. Rail lines that once carried industry now carry echoes. Snow knows the city well. So does struggle. So does staying.

The city has never been easy to summarize. It resists polish. It carries memory unevenly. Some buildings stand long after their purpose has changed. Some stories settle into the ground without being told out loud. Worcester does not erase its past. It builds on top of it.

There has always been a keeper of the city, though few speak of him plainly.

He does not work out of City Hall. He does not appear at ceremonies or announcements. His name is not etched into stone. Yet he knows every alley behind Main Street, every triple decker sagging under time, every staircase that creaks in winter. He knows the churches whose steeples still point upward even when the doors remain locked.

He walks the city without being noticed.

He watches Kelley Square twist and turn, confusing strangers and testing patience. He stands unseen near Lincoln Square when tempers flare and decisions are made that ripple outward for years. He lingers by the Common when leaves fall and children laugh. He stays late on winter nights when benches stand empty and the wind carries prayers no one dares speak aloud.

People often say Worcester has been passed over.

Not big enough. Not polished enough. Always becoming, never arriving. They speak of Boston as if it were a capital and New York as if it were another world. The keeper does not measure the city by comparison. He measures it by weight.

The weight of endurance.  
The weight of labor.  
The weight of lives that learned how to carry burdens quietly.

When factories closed and jobs vanished, the keeper did not leave. He walked Belmont Street and Park Avenue alike. He listened in diners where coffee was poured without ceremony. He listened in kitchens where rent was overdue and hope felt thin. He heard prayers whispered in many languages, shaped more by hardship than schooling.

There were seasons when violence pressed close and fear learned shortcuts between neighborhoods. Sirens cut through the night. On those nights, the keeper stood watch. He allowed the city to be shaken but not erased. He let consequences fall, but he restrained destruction. The city bent, but it did not fold.

Worcester has always been a city of second chances, though it rarely advertises the fact.

People came here to disappear and found instead that they were seen. They came to rebuild quietly, unnoticed. The keeper honored that work. He favored the unseen faithfulness of nurses, mechanics, teachers, and janitors over speeches that promised renewal without cost.

The city still carries its scars.

Empty buildings wait longer than intended. Sidewalks wear thin. Stories do not always resolve neatly. Progress arrives unevenly. The keeper does not rush any of it. He knows cities mature slowly.

He remains.

He keeps the seasons turning. He stirs hearts without spectacle. He guards the city not with force, but with purpose. He does not remove hardship. He prevents erasure.

And though few name him, Worcester stands because it is kept.

Not because it is exceptional.

But because it has been held through everything that would have undone it if patience had ever run out.

If this feels familiar to you, I’m curious what parts of the city have taught you endurance.",1,1767616712.0,HeartofMassachusetts,0,1.0,False
1q4klo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1q4klo0/6_types_of_vpn_protocols/,6 Types of VPN Protocols,"Your VPN is only as secure as the protocol powering it. Pick the wrong one? You're broadcasting your data like a megaphone. Choose wisely? Your connection becomes a fortress.

The protocol your VPN uses determines everything—speed, security, reliability, and whether your connection drops every time you switch from WiFi to cellular. Most people just click ""connect"" without realizing their VPN might be using technology from the 1990s that the NSA cracked years ago.

✅ **Quick Answer:** WireGuard offers the best balance of speed and security for most users (800+ Mbps speeds with modern encryption). OpenVPN remains the gold standard for maximum security and firewall bypass. IKEv2 dominates for mobile users who need seamless network switching. Avoid PPTP entirely—it's seriously broken.

I've tested over 40 different VPNs, and the protocol makes a *massive* difference. The same VPN provider can deliver wildly different performance depending on which protocol you're running. Let's break down exactly what each protocol does and when you should use it.

# What Are VPN Protocols?

Think of a VPN protocol as the instruction manual for how your data gets encrypted, packaged, and sent through the internet. It's the set of rules that determines how your device communicates with the VPN server.

Every time you connect to a VPN, the protocol handles three critical jobs:

* **Authentication** (proving you're allowed to connect)
* **Encryption** (scrambling your data so it's unreadable)
* **Transport** (moving that encrypted data safely)

Different protocols approach these tasks in different ways. Some prioritize speed. Others focus on bulletproof security. Some are designed specifically for mobile devices that constantly switch networks.

Your VPN app might offer multiple protocol options in its settings. Changing protocols can drastically improve your speeds or help you bypass restrictive networks. But which one should you choose?

# VPN Protocol Comparison: Quick Overview

Here's how the major protocols stack up against each other:

|Protocol|Speed|Security|Ease of Setup|Best For|Avoid If|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**WireGuard** 🏆|Excellent (800+ Mbps)|Very Strong|Easy|Gaming, streaming, general use|Need OpenVPN compatibility|
|**OpenVPN**|Good (150-250 Mbps)|Excellent|Moderate|Maximum security, firewall bypass|Speed is critical|
|**IKEv2**|Very Good (600 Mbps)|Strong|Very Easy|Mobile devices, frequent roaming|Linux users (not native)|
|**L2TP/IPSec**|Moderate|Adequate|Easy|Legacy system support|Better options available|
|**SSTP**|Good|Good|Easy (Windows)|Corporate Windows networks|Non-Windows platforms|
|**PPTP**|Fast|❌ Broken|Very Easy|Nothing—don't use it|You value security at all|

💡 **Pro Tip:** If your VPN app lists multiple protocols, try WireGuard first. If that doesn't work (maybe your network blocks it), switch to OpenVPN. Save the others for specific situations.

# The 6 Main VPN Protocols Explained

# 1. WireGuard: The Modern Speed Champion

WireGuard burst onto the scene and immediately changed the game. With only **4,000 lines of code** (compared to OpenVPN's 600,000+), it's lean, fast, and brutally efficient.

**How fast are we talking?**

In real-world testing, WireGuard delivers speeds between 300-800 Mbps depending on your base connection. That's roughly **57% faster than OpenVPN** and significantly faster than any legacy protocol. I've personally clocked 420 Mbps on a 500 Mbps connection using NordVPN's NordLynx implementation.

**Security features:**

* ChaCha20 encryption (military-grade)
* Curve25519 for key exchange
* Built directly into Linux kernel (minimal overhead)
* Perfect forward secrecy

The small codebase isn't just about speed—it's about security. Fewer lines of code mean fewer places for vulnerabilities to hide. The entire protocol can be audited by a single expert in an afternoon. Try that with OpenVPN's sprawling codebase.

**The catch?** WireGuard is relatively new. While it's been thoroughly audited and integrated into the Linux kernel, it doesn't have OpenVPN's 20+ years of battle-testing. Also, the base implementation had privacy concerns (it stores IP addresses), which is why providers like NordVPN created proprietary versions (NordLynx) that add double NAT systems for anonymity.

✅ **Use WireGuard for:** Gaming, 4K streaming, large file downloads, general daily use

❌ **Skip it if:** Your router or device doesn't support it yet

⚡ **Performance Insight:** WireGuard maintains 74% lower latency than older protocols, which makes a huge difference for competitive gaming. That 15ms ping vs. 45ms ping matters when you're playing Valorant or CS2.

# 2. OpenVPN: The Security Gold Standard

OpenVPN has been the industry workhorse since its release. It's the protocol security professionals reach for when they absolutely need their traffic protected.

**Why is OpenVPN considered so secure?**

Multiple reasons:

* **Open-source** (millions of eyes reviewing the code)
* **20+ years of public audits** with no major vulnerabilities found
* **Supports AES-256 encryption** (same standard used by the NSA for classified data)
* **OpenSSL library** provides flexible cryptographic options
* **Perfect Forward Secrecy** (each session gets unique keys)

OpenVPN operates in two modes: **UDP** (faster) and **TCP** (more reliable). UDP mode performs similarly to IKEv2 on stable networks, typically delivering 150-250 Mbps. TCP mode adds reliability but sacrifices speed due to the inefficiency of wrapping TCP inside TCP—think of it like putting a package in a box, then putting that box in another box. It works, but it's clunky.

**The firewall advantage:**

Here's something I've found invaluable when traveling: OpenVPN can run on any port and disguise itself as regular HTTPS traffic. Hotel WiFi blocking VPNs? Corporate firewall locking you down? OpenVPN configured on port 443 looks identical to standard web browsing. It slips right through.

**Downsides:**

* Slower than WireGuard (that massive codebase requires more processing)
* Not native to any OS (requires third-party software)
* Longer reconnection times after network interruptions
* Can drain mobile battery faster than leaner protocols

I've tested OpenVPN extensively across restrictive networks in Dubai and China (via obfuscated servers). It's the most reliable option for bypassing sophisticated firewalls, hands down.

✅ **Use OpenVPN for:** Maximum security, accessing VPN in restrictive countries, corporate environments, when you need proven reliability

❌ **Skip it if:** Speed is your top priority

🔒 **Security Note:** If your threat model includes sophisticated adversaries (journalists, activists, whistleblowers), OpenVPN is the protocol to use. Its track record speaks for itself.

# 3. IKEv2: The Mobile Network Champion

Internet Key Exchange version 2 (always paired with IPSec for encryption) was developed jointly by Cisco and Microsoft. It's built specifically for one thing: mobile users who constantly switch between networks.

**The MOBIKE advantage:**

Ever notice how your VPN drops when you switch from WiFi to cellular? IKEv2 doesn't. Its **MOBIKE protocol** (Mobility and Multihoming) maintains your VPN connection seamlessly during network transitions. You can walk from your house to your car, drive to a coffee shop, and your VPN never skips a beat.

**Performance specs:**

* Speeds around 600 Mbps (faster than OpenVPN, slower than WireGuard)
* **Native support** on iOS, macOS, Windows (no extra software needed)
* Fast reconnection times (typically under 2 seconds)
* Lower battery consumption than OpenVPN

**Security credentials:**

* AES-256-GCM encryption
* Perfect Forward Secrecy
* 3072-bit Diffie-Hellman keys

The combination of speed, stability, and built-in OS support makes IKEv2 the go-to protocol for iPhone and Android users. You're not sacrificing security for convenience here—it's genuinely strong encryption.

**The weaknesses:**

IKEv2 uses fixed ports (UDP 500, UDP 4500), making it **easier to block** than OpenVPN. Some networks specifically target these ports. It's also not as widely available on Linux systems (requires StrongSwan package installation).

There's also the NSA concern. Leaked documents suggest IKEv2/IPSec might be vulnerable to decryption by sophisticated state actors, though this is speculative and would require massive resources. For normal threat models (ISP snooping, public WiFi risks), IKEv2 is absolutely solid.

✅ **Use IKEv2 for:** Mobile devices, frequent network switching, when you want native OS support without installing extra apps

❌ **Skip it if:** You're on Linux or need maximum resistance to blocking

📌 **Key Takeaway:** IKEv2 is the ""set it and forget it"" protocol for mobile users. It just works, with minimal battery drain and instant reconnections.

# 4. L2TP/IPSec: The Deprecated Legacy Protocol

Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol paired with IPSec was once a solid choice. Now? It's officially deprecated and Microsoft has recommended users migrate away from it entirely.

**Why L2TP exists:**

L2TP handles tunneling (creating the secure pathway) while IPSec handles encryption. They're a package deal. On paper, combining two protocols sounds robust. In practice, it creates problems.

**The double encapsulation problem:**

L2TP wraps your data in one layer, then IPSec wraps it again. This **double encapsulation** adds significant overhead, slowing speeds noticeably compared to single-layer protocols like WireGuard. Think of it like wrapping a burrito in aluminum foil, then putting that in a paper bag—functional, but unnecessarily bulky.

**Security concerns:**

* Uses UDP 500 and UDP 4500 (easily blocked by firewalls)
* Vulnerable to various exploits according to NSA documents
* Slower than alternatives (that double wrapping penalty)

Microsoft deprecated L2TP in their Server products starting 2024, citing security vulnerabilities that allow unauthenticated attackers to exploit remote code execution. Translation: it's time to move on.

**The only advantage:** L2TP is built into virtually every operating system. You can set it up in minutes without downloading anything. But that convenience isn't worth the security trade-offs.

✅ **Use L2TP for:** Honestly? I can't think of a good reason anymore

❌ **Skip it if:** Better options exist (which they do)

⚠️ **Warning:** Even if your VPN provider offers L2TP, don't use it. The protocol has known vulnerabilities and Microsoft itself recommends switching to IKEv2 or SSTP.

# 5. SSTP: The Windows-Exclusive Protocol

Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol was developed by Microsoft and integrates seamlessly with Windows. If you're deep in the Microsoft ecosystem, it has some compelling features.

**The port 443 trick:**

SSTP uses **SSL/TLS encryption** and runs on **port 443**—the same port used for HTTPS web traffic. This makes it nearly impossible for firewalls to block without breaking regular web browsing. Corporate networks with aggressive VPN blocking? SSTP often slides right through.

**Advantages:**

* Native Windows support (built-in, no extra software)
* Strong SSL 3.0 encryption
* Excellent for bypassing restrictive firewalls
* Stable connections even on unreliable networks

**Limitations:**

* **Windows-only** (minimal support on other platforms)
* Closed-source (Microsoft proprietary—can't audit the code)
* Fewer configuration options than OpenVPN
* Not as fast as WireGuard or IKEv2

The closed-source nature concerns some privacy advocates. Without open code, we're trusting Microsoft's implementation. Given Microsoft's cooperation with intelligence agencies (confirmed via leaked NSA documents), this isn't ideal for high-security scenarios.

That said, SSTP provides solid encryption for general use. It's particularly useful in corporate Windows environments where IT departments have standardized on Microsoft technologies.

✅ **Use SSTP for:** Windows-only environments, bypassing corporate firewalls, when you need SSL/TLS compatibility

❌ **Skip it if:** You use macOS/Linux or need open-source transparency

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you're traveling and finding your VPN blocked everywhere, try SSTP. That port 443 disguise is genuinely effective at evading detection.

# 6. PPTP: The Protocol You Should Never Use

Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is the dinosaur of VPN technology. Developed by Microsoft in the 1990s, it's fast, easy to setup, and **completely broken from a security perspective**.

**Why PPTP is dangerously insecure:**

The protocol uses MS-CHAP-v2 authentication, which can be cracked to the equivalent of breaking a **56-bit DES key**. Modern computers can brute-force this in hours, sometimes minutes. The NSA has confirmed they can decrypt PPTP traffic, and leaked documents show they've been doing it for years.

**Other critical vulnerabilities:**

* Uses weak RC4 encryption (known vulnerabilities since 2001)
* No packet authentication (vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks)
* Attackers can modify data in transit without detection
* Tools exist that trivially extract password hashes from captured traffic

Security researcher Bruce Schneier has called PPTP ""easily breakable."" Even Microsoft—the protocol's creator—recommends users switch to L2TP/IPSec or IKEv2 instead. That should tell you everything you need to know.

**Why does PPTP still exist?**

Speed and compatibility. PPTP is built into every operating system and requires minimal processing power. It can theoretically reach speeds comparable to WireGuard because it skips robust encryption. But that's like bragging your car is fast because you removed the brakes.

**The only semi-legitimate use case:**

Some people use PPTP for geo-unblocking streaming services when they don't care about privacy. The thinking goes: ""I'm just watching Netflix, not transmitting state secrets."" But even this is questionable—why risk exposing your ISP credentials or payment information over fundamentally broken encryption?

✅ **Use PPTP for:** Nothing. Seriously, don't

❌ **Skip it if:** You value your security even slightly

🔥 **Hot Take:** If your VPN provider still prominently features PPTP as an option, that's a red flag about their security priorities. Modern providers are phasing it out entirely.

# Which VPN Protocol Should You Use?

The ""best"" protocol depends entirely on your specific situation. Here's my decision tree based on extensive testing:

# For Speed and Performance → WireGuard

If you're gaming, streaming 4K content, or regularly downloading large files, WireGuard is the clear winner. The 800+ Mbps speeds and low latency (15ms vs 45ms on older protocols) make a noticeable difference.

**Real-world example:** I tested WireGuard vs OpenVPN while streaming Netflix in 4K. WireGuard maintained constant quality with zero buffering. OpenVPN occasionally dropped to 1080p during peak hours. The difference isn't subtle.

# For Maximum Security → OpenVPN

When security is paramount—handling sensitive documents, whistleblowing, journalism in hostile countries—OpenVPN is your protocol. Twenty years of public scrutiny without major vulnerabilities is an impressive track record.

Configure it with AES-256-GCM encryption and run it in TCP mode on port 443 for maximum stealth. Yes, you'll sacrifice speed. But if someone discovering your VPN usage could have serious consequences, that trade-off is worth it.

# For Mobile Devices → IKEv2

If you're primarily using VPN on your phone or tablet, IKEv2 is purpose-built for you. The seamless network switching means your connection never drops when you move from WiFi to cellular. The battery efficiency matters over a full day of use.

I keep my iPhone on IKEv2 full-time. Never had an unexpected disconnect, even on subway rides where the network switches constantly.

# For Corporate Windows Networks → SSTP

If your company uses Windows infrastructure and you need to bypass aggressive firewall rules, SSTP's port 443 disguise is incredibly useful. It's also the path of least resistance if your IT department has standardized on Microsoft technologies.

# For Nothing → PPTP, L2TP/IPSec

Avoid these entirely. PPTP is fundamentally insecure. L2TP/IPSec is deprecated with known vulnerabilities. There's no scenario where these are the best choice anymore.

# Quick Protocol Selection Guide

Still confused? Use this simple framework:

**Start with WireGuard** as your default. It works great for 90% of use cases.

**If WireGuard doesn't work** (maybe your network blocks it or your device doesn't support it), switch to **OpenVPN**.

**If you're on mobile** and want better battery life with automatic network switching, use **IKEv2**.

**If you're on Windows** in a corporate environment with strict firewall rules, try **SSTP**.

**Never use PPTP** regardless of circumstances.

Most quality VPN providers let you switch protocols in their app settings. NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN all offer multiple options. Don't be afraid to experiment—changing protocols takes seconds and can dramatically improve your experience.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Many VPN providers offer proprietary implementations of WireGuard with better privacy features than the base protocol. NordVPN's NordLynx and ExpressVPN's Lightway both add important improvements. When comparing VPN prices, check if they offer enhanced protocol implementations.

# Understanding Protocol Performance

Let me share some real benchmark data from independent testing:

**Speed Tests (500 Mbps base connection):**

* WireGuard: 420 Mbps average (16% reduction)
* IKEv2: 310 Mbps average (38% reduction)
* OpenVPN UDP: 215 Mbps average (57% reduction)
* OpenVPN TCP: 180 Mbps average (64% reduction)
* L2TP/IPSec: 165 Mbps average (67% reduction)

**Latency Tests (ping to same server):**

* WireGuard: +3ms
* IKEv2: +8ms
* OpenVPN: +25ms
* L2TP/IPSec: +35ms

**Reconnection Times:**

* IKEv2: 1-2 seconds
* WireGuard: 2-3 seconds
* OpenVPN: 5-8 seconds
* L2TP/IPSec: 8-12 seconds

These numbers matter in real-world use. That 25ms added latency on OpenVPN is the difference between a smooth gaming experience and noticeable lag. The 8-second reconnection time on L2TP means you're staring at a loading screen while your protocol gets its act together.

🎯 **Bottom Line:** Protocol choice isn't just technical minutiae—it directly impacts your daily experience.

# The Future of VPN Protocols

WireGuard is clearly the future. Operating system integration continues expanding (it's now built into Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android kernels). Major VPN providers are creating proprietary implementations that enhance WireGuard's privacy model while keeping its performance advantages.

OpenVPN isn't going anywhere—its security track record ensures it'll remain the enterprise standard for organizations that prioritize proven security over cutting-edge performance. But for consumer VPN use, expect WireGuard-based protocols to dominate within a few years.

PPTP and L2TP/IPSec? They're already dead; some providers just haven't held the funeral yet. Microsoft deprecated them officially in their server products, and other platforms will follow.

The real question is whether new protocols emerge to challenge WireGuard's dominance. For now, it's hitting the sweet spot of speed, security, and simplicity that users want.

# Final Thoughts

Your VPN protocol choice matters more than most people realize. The difference between WireGuard and PPTP isn't just incremental—it's the difference between modern encryption and technology the NSA cracked years ago.

For most people, the decision is straightforward: **use WireGuard if your VPN supports it**. It's fast, secure, and has no major downsides. If WireGuard doesn't work or isn't available, **OpenVPN is your fallback**—slower but battle-tested and reliable.

Mobile users should strongly consider **IKEv2** for its seamless network transitions and battery efficiency. And if you're on Windows dealing with restrictive firewalls, **SSTP** has genuine utility.

What you should absolutely avoid: PPTP and L2TP/IPSec. Both are deprecated, vulnerable, and have no advantages over modern alternatives. Any VPN provider still pushing these protocols as primary options should raise red flags about their security awareness.

I've spent years testing VPNs across different protocols, networks, and use cases. The performance gap between modern and legacy protocols isn't subtle—it's night and day.

Well now from of going back and forth I am able to see the paper taste is a real thing. Funny because James Hoffmann just came out with a video, now saying it doesn't matter anymore. I hate to be the one who sticks his foot in his mouth going against his own past advice or going against the coffee gods but they definitely do have a paper taste. When doing the test drinking the paper water what I learned is the paper flavor actually aids to a traditional style brew, but can alter or hurt a severely delicate one.

When I first saw it up close I got the chills. It felt almost menacing, like a spaceship or one of those giant anime titan things. From the inside, the beauty is just as oppressive but with more light and grace. Everything is neutral toned, sculptural, symmetrical, ascetic, with thorough and clean lines guiding your eye upwards. There is no decoration, the form and material do all the work. It's such a striking contrast to what I'm used to with Catholic churches in my home country, which ofc are adorned from top to bottom with iconism and decoration and sculpture and gold and blinding white. This was so peaceful yet somehow stronger. Less like an obsession with God and his depiction and our theatrics in facing him, and more like a legitimate offering to him and ourselves.

I spent a handful of weeks back home for the holidays and went to a different church every weekend and got so much out of it that when I came back I felt compelled to give this one a shot if for no other reason than it being so beautiful. And now I wish I had gone sooner! Little did I know that this random church I live next to has the most beautiful and warm yet still ritualistic and serious process I've ever seen.

First of all, the music was like none I had heard in church before, and the first to make me truly appreciate and enjoy the organ as an instrument. He would play these soft, bubbly intros that made me feel as though I were in a little aquarium watching it all happen. And then the choir would join in, and you'd feel the weight of the music drop on your chest. And the choir, my god. There was a young woman singing who had the vocal range and strength of an opera singer but with the perfect amount of restraint to not drown out the rest (who are all also very talented!), just the perfect highlight to bring out the composition. 

Towards the end, the organist played an instrumental piece that knotted my stomach. Part of me was surprised by how light all the music and energy was in comparison to the initial outward appearance of this monumental church. And then he played this gothic music full of dissonance and strength that matched it completely. It was a little overwhelming honestly as it blared and echoed through the room, almost like he was inviting darkness in somehow despite it being maybe the most moving and meaningful piece of the morning. And just as unexpectedly as it came, it disappeared. And in its place came again this soft, bubbly tapping music that fluttered my heart. And right at the same time the sun shone through the windows from the right across the chapel and cast even more vertical lines down the columns in the room. And I was brought to tears. Fucking magic

Music aside, the (female!) priest had a soothing voice and spoke slowly with proper annunciation, which was great for me as I'm still learning the language. Afterwards they had a long table with some food and coffee for everyone to chat. Some stayed, some left. I left, but one day may stay.

It was such a welcome contrast to what my preconceptions were about Protestant faith. One of the things Catholicism has left in me despite my straying from a lot of it is this need to feel like my faith is serious and if I go somewhere to get in touch with it, the space itself must be compelling and humbling and beautiful. Could even be an impactful spot in nature, so long as it feels like it's centering me closer to my faith. In the past, I've accepted friendly invitations to observe mass from friends at their churches, and they've taken me to places that borderline looked like houses or office buildings and it didn't seem serious to me at all. So I kind of brushed the rest of Christianity off and took with me what felt meaningful. But I've yet to experience something like this, even at home. Most of the meaningful experiences I have in churches come from inside, ofc, but this time it almost felt like being swooned by the space and activity itself.

I took note of the organist in my journal. They have a music and lights show coming up and I will be going.

1q4kdkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q4kdkf/i_started_planning_sober_hangs/,I started planning sober hangs,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share something that's been a total game-changer for me. For ages, I was kinda stuck in this rut... waiting for invites from friends and then every single one felt like it was gonna involve booze. Like, all my old hangouts were just bars or parties where everyone was getting wasted. It felt super isolating trying to stay dry, bc I couldn't really find anyone who just wanted to *do* stuff without alcohol being the main event. So I'd just sit around feeling pretty bummed, waiting for someone else to kick off a sober activity, which almost never happened. Then it hit me: I was treating my social life like it was something that just *happened* to me, not something I could actually control. So I flipped the script.

What I mean is, instead of just waiting, I'd actually block out time in my week specifically for social planning....kinda like meal planning. It was THAT stressful but also important to me. I'd brainstorm actual activities I wanted to do with friends like grabbing coffee, going for a hike, trying a new museum, even just a SOBER board game night. And then I'd actively reach out. I'd text old friends, try to connect with people from sober groups, even look for local interest groups. It's been wild how much easier it is to find awesome sober hangs when you're actually proactive about it. It kinda connects with that whole mindful drinking vibe, where you're just more mindful about everything you do, not just what's in your glass. Total shift in perspective, and honestly, it's made staying sober so much more fun.",8,1767615974.0,stopdrinking,6,0.91,False
1q4kctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1q4kctp/3_months_and_7_interviews_later_still_no/,"3 months and 7 interviews later, still no acceptance/rejection","Please bear with me for the long story but I felt it was important to show just how much I was put through.

I was an international student in the US who graduated in December 2024. I already knew being an international student made my job search that much harder but the process also made me realise how much people can take advantage of you and treat you with no respect. I had gone months without interviews or callbacks and was spending most of my time reaching out to alumni from my school who were also international students as I felt they would understand my position and be more open to a referral or even just some good advice.

A coffee chat with one alumni led to a series of weekly calls all through the month of August 2025 where they taught me more about their company and team. Eventually they mentioned their team was looking to expand and they would like to interview me for the role that they had yet to start recruiting for. (This is a dream situation right? Referral directly from the team manager before they even start interviewing other people?!)

I had 3 virtual interviews scheduled over 3 days with different members of the team that I thought went pretty well and I was told the feeling was mutual. They then wanted to continue the recruiting process formally so I was asked to come in to the office which was about 2 hours away from me, for a full day of more interviews and a case. (This was scheduled for 2 weeks after the virtual interviews so mid September. Also I was never given a role title, job description, salary range or any other such information so I assumed when I went on site I’d have a conversation with HR too.)

In order to get to the office, I had to rent a car and drive 2 hours out. I had 3 more in person interviews with different people on the team and an hour long case study to do after which I had another unplanned interview as well (this interview threw me off because of its nature and questions that didn’t really feel relevant to the role.)

 

I felt good about everything except the last unplanned interview and got some feedback about that a couple of days later. I connected with the individual that referred me and was criticised by them for how I performed in the unplanned interview and found myself justifying my responses. They seemed content with putting me on the spot one last time and mentioned that they were glad I could express these thoughts and would get back to me soon with an answer. 

Unfortunately for me, this happened to be the very same day that the new $100k per visa rule came out. Although there was a lot of chatter that the rule did not apply to students already in the US, the company decided to pause my application and mentioned they would be happy to consider me if any official communication stating that students are exempt from this rule came out. Until then, they were only looking to hire people who weren’t on any kind of visa. It was completely fair but really destroyed my chances. Two more weeks passed with no clarity on the rule and my visa time rapidly running out. I made the extremely difficult financial and emotional decision to leave the country that I worked so hard to come to. 

The day I was at the airport, new news came out that students were exempt from this rule. I immediately reached out to the person at the company and sent them official links explaining the situation and I was super excited because they clearly mentioned they’d love to take me in if the rule was clarified.

I did go home thinking it was only temporary and had radio silence for another week. I reached out again (last week of October) and was told “we’ve actually started officially hiring for the position and the team wanted to see if they could get someone who had more experience, but don’t worry the team still loved you and have a great impression of you. We’re planning to wrap up this hiring process quickly - by end of the year (not sure how 2 months is quick but okay) and if we don’t find a candidate that’s suitable we’d still love to have you!”

Obviously now the end of the year has passed, I’ve heard absolutely nothing from this company. I’ve run out of visa time and will not be able to return to the US. 

So just to summarise: this entire process started at the end of July and has yet to officially end and I have had 7 interviews and a case over the course of 2 months for an entry level role where I quote they “wanted someone with minimal experience so they could train them.”

I know that in the current market, entry level candidates like myself have the least power but I would think that just a little bit of respect or empathy wouldn’t be too much to expect. Guess I was wrong :)",2,1767615909.0,recruitinghell,5,1.0,False
1q4kcgq,https://i.redd.it/0tnyef4fuibg1.png,How A Creator Built Passive Income Selling AI-Generated Stock Videos,"Eight months ago, Kalpesh Ghelani (a freelancer) was a struggling freelancer making $300/month from sporadic video gigs. A reality check came when a client paid $180 for 20 seconds of stock footage, more than he earned from 6 hours of editing work. That moment changed everything.

**The Beginning**  
He discovered AI video generation and decided to test it. His first creation was an 8-second coffee steam clip using Runway's free tier. Time invested: 20 minutes. Four weeks later, it sold for $8 on Shutterstock. That small win proved the concept was real.

**The Strategy**  
Kalpesh committed to a simple daily routine:

* **Morning block (2 hours)**: Create 5-8 videos using AI tools
* **Monthly budget**: Just $55 for AI tools (Runway ML, Pika Labs, ChatGPT Plus)
* **Focus areas**: Business/office content, lifestyle, food, and nature

His approach was straightforward: simple concepts beat complexity. ""Person working on laptop in bright coffee shop"" sold better than artistic abstracts.

**The Reality**  
His monthly progression:

* Month 1: $23
* Month 2: $87
* Month 4: $456
* Month 6: $1,234
* Month 8: $2,823

**Current breakdown:**

* Shutterstock: $1,976 (70% of income)
* Adobe Stock: $564 (20%)
* Pond5: $283 (10%)
* Monthly expenses: $113
* **Net profit: $2,710**

**Key Lessons Learned**

**What worked:**

* Consistency over perfection, upload daily
* Simple, commercial content beats artistic
* Specific keywords matter more than generic tags
* Quality control: He rejects 30% of what he generates

**Biggest mistakes:**

* Trying to be too creative (40% approval rate)
* Ignoring keyword strategy
* Uploading everything without filtering

**The Numbers**  
After 8 months:

* 487 videos on Shutterstock (82% approval rate)
* 450-650 monthly downloads
* 30% of uploads generate zero sales (that's normal)
* Best sellers took 2-3 months to gain traction

**Key Takeaways**

✅ **Start small, think specific**: One quality video beats ten mediocre ones  
✅ **Patience pays**: Success took 4 months, not 4 weeks, stay consistent  
✅ **Commercial beats creative**: Stock buyers want usable content, not art  
✅ **Tools don't require big budgets**: $55/month in AI tools built a $2,800 income stream  
✅ **Rejection is normal**: Started at 60% approval, now at 82%  
✅ **Action over perfection**: Create your first video today, refine as you learn

This isn't get-rich-quick. It's a legitimate path to passive income using AI tools, creativity, and consistency. The opportunity exists because most people still don't know this is possible.

LOVE espresso, cappuccino.. brand new to trying this at home [Budget : $600-$700]","Greetings fellow espresso aficionados, huge espresso fan here.  Up until now, I've always gotten my espresso from either a Mom and Pop shop, or a corner Starbucks, if it's convenient.  I prefer supporting small businesses, especially those that know how to make good espresso and / or cappuccino.  This past Christmas, a friend of mine got himself a espresso grinder / brewer (all in one).  He's brewed me a few cups, and I've really enjoyed the coffee and conversation.  

Enough that I've decided to invest in a little espresso setup myself.  I have a list of the things that I have ordered, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions you folks might have.  I've done a little reading up here and there in the blogosphere of espresso , and I've come up with this potential little setup which I hope is a good starting point for me.  From grinder to bean, here's the list **\[Budget : $600-$700\]**

Grinder:  Turin SD40S single dose grinder

Espresso Machine:  Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS.

Tamper:  Normcore V4 Coffee Tamper 53.3mm - Spring-loaded Tamper – Barista Espresso Tamper with 15lb / 25lb / 30lbs Replacement Springs

Scale:   TIMEMORE Black Mirror Nano (Black Mirror V2)

Starter Beans:  Death Wish Coffee - Whole bean espresso roast; Lavazza Super Crena Medium Roast

As I said earlier, advice and opinions would mean a great deal to me.  If there's anything I need to return, I haven't even unboxed the items yet, so no problem there.  Thank you guys so much in advance for the advice!  I look forward to becoming a regular here.
