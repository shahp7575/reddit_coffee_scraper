All that goes to say: I love the Roubaix I bought back in 2013. I ride with Birkenstocks on - it’s great.

Thinking about getting a newer model but noticed the SL8 came out in September 2023. Does this mean a new model is expected for late this year or next year? Would it be wise to wait for that to come out? If it is out, does that put the remaining SL8 models in stores at a discount that’s hard to pass up?

1qszkub,https://i.redd.it/wdd19u746wgg1.png,My first time reaching for the Gods.,"I've been into hellenism for some months,  but never tried to actually talk to any of the Gods just yet. I was scared, and honestly didn’t knew what to say. But yesterday i had a dream about making a offering to hermes, and it really stuck on my head. Since i live with my family, its hard for me to practice witchcraft and any form of religion, but surprisingly, after a long time, i would be alone at home last night! It was my chance to try it out.

I honestly didn’t expected much, wasn't looking foward talking personally with any god or any super magical experience, since it was my first time doing so. Yes, I've lit some candles, tried to pray sometimes, but that was it. I am really a mess about faith, I've left Christian church when i was still a kid, so i never learned from anyone how to...belive. How to be so natural when talking to a divinity, or how to pray even, and trying to start on a different religion such as hellenism feels even more weird to me. But I've always, since small, loved greek mythology and history of Greece. I remember when i discovered about the Greek Gods and got so drawn to it. It was years ago, circling around the religion without entering for once, until last night.

I wanted to start by Hestia and Hermes. Hestia because of the readings i did about her, seemed a good way to start, and because I think the Goddess of the fire should be honored first anyway, since she is the one to take our offerings to the Gods. Hermes because, well, i dreamed specifically about him, and i always felt drawn to him during my studies, even did a necklace to him a while back but was afraid to consagrate it to him.

I did some black coffee to offer them, seemed a good way to start. Where i live, preparing coffee to someone is very welcoming gesture, so it made sense to me. Than i lit a white candles for each. I talked first to Hestia, did a lil prayer to her(stumbled a bit but i tried ok) and presented myself and the offering. Than to hermes, did the same and consagrated that necklace to him, promising to honor him as i wear it. 

Then came a awkward silence...
I didn’t knew what to do next. Like, do people pray and thats it? Should i put on some netflix to entertain them? I honestly didn’t knew. So i decided to do some guided meditation. 

First of all, i must say it went kinda horrible because I've been interrupted like, seven times. My mom called, my lil cousin rang the doorbell, and SO MANY YOUTUBE ADS. I had a heart attack with each fucking ad, it was SO LOUD.

Anyway. As i did so, i felt...warm? Maybe not physically, because of my AC, but like, in my core? I don't know why, but i teared up a bit. I felt like a mother warm, like specifically a women, a Goddess i mean, was there. Idk. 
As i kept going, i sometimes, for a small fraction, saw like a silhouette or a hunter. I didn't knew if it was my mind with intrusive thoughts or what.

It was a visualization guided meditation, so the guy was leading me to this altar with offerings. He was talking and talking and then told me to do an offering to one of the Gods. Not to choose one, just...feel it. Again, that hunter silhouette on my mind, now facing me? The name of Artemis came on my mind suddenly. As the guy passed through the names of the Gods, told about them, i could only kept being drawn to Artemis, idk why. I repeated a prayer, and so visualized the offering to her. He told me to throw my biggest regret, guilty, or fear on the fire of the altar, and i did so. A consuming guilt i have, a regret. I specifically feared Artemis because of this regret, for a long time, afraid of her judgment. Thats why i was so confused and nervous that she was the one to keep coming in my mind.
I poured the offering and my fears on the fire, at that time i was actually crying a bit idk why lol.

As it ended, i felt...idk, warm? Comfortable? Like coming out of a hug. My candles was still lit. 

I read tarot for more than a year already, so tried it. Asked if there were anyone there who would like to answer to me through my cards, The Emprees and The High Priestess literally jumped, so i readed it as Hestia, for the feeling i first got when meditating. I was a bit nervous still, didn't knew what to ask. So i asked her what she expected from our journey togueter ahead.
I got Ten of pentacles, three of swords reversed, and page of cups. I read those as looking foward a good partnership, that we would have a lot to work on with my internal struggles and she understand my need to vent to her. 
Then, i said i really wanted to give it a real try to hellenism, that I've tried other religions before but never felt like...at home or just didn’t felt like wanting to continue, coming from that, i asked if she had any advices for me to keep on this path.
I drawn Justice reversed, eight of pentacles and five of wands reversed.
I read as that there would be some rough time considering the ones i live with, that i might not be able to speak my truth and feel overruled, abd that i must find my voice and hold tight on what i belive in, that i would need to put actual work on it and take a time to study properly it all and that i should be really careful with misinformation spread about the practices.

I wished to continue but my dad got home and i had to organize it all. Though i kept the candles lit till the end.
I didnt feel hermes at all, or anything alike lol. I honestly decided to do it today because i dreamed i offered to him, but at the end i only felt hestia and a bit of Artemis? If i am even right, scare to have been imagining it all.

I was really different from what i expect. Im scared to have done something wrong or maybe not even talked really to anyone, but still it felt nice. Sorry for the long text, i have no one to talk to about this experience.
Any advices are very welcome! Thank you!",2,1769955398.0,Hellenism,0,1.0,False

1qszjv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyperphantasia/comments/1qszjv8/here_are_some_of_my_experiences_from_someone_whos/,"Here are some of my experiences - from someone who's just discovered that there's an explanation for their ""overactive"" brain","Today, as i sat having coffee next to a main road, I imagined a whole scenario of a car crash - watching it happen, someone flying through the windscreen, calling 999, speaking to the operator, watching the blood pool under the casualty, etc etc. Probably made worse by the fact i hadn't bought my headphones out to distract me from all the city noise.

Every single day, especially when i'm outside, i'm imagining the worst of things. I can feel what it would be like to be ploughed into by a car, smacking my face into the ground, someone shoving me, being thrown onto the underground train tracks, the list goes on. I always have done and i always assumed i was just a bit of a worrier compared to other folk. 

This led me to finally google something like ""vivid imagination feels like a curse"" and then a few pages popped up about hyperphantasia. Thank god !!!! There's an answer... 

But i wanted to share some things i've done for my whole life and see if anyone else experiences the same thing? 

Biggest one for me is that i cannot fall asleep without noise in the background. Sometimes my body is calm enough for rain noises, but most times i need words so go for a youtube video. When i was younger it was audiobooks. Without it, my brain imagines the worst scenarios or just doesn't shut off- the noise works as a distraction even if the volume is super low to the point where it just sounds like murmuring. If im sharing a bed however, its fine? Almost as if the other person being there stops my brain from being dramatic. 

I can picture things in my minds eye perfectly when my eyes are open, plan projects etc. I'm an art student and have done art my whole life, but always leaned toward applied arts (textiles, film, ceramics, anything 3d that i can create with my hands). When im sewing something or designing something, i walk through it in my mind through my eyes (if that makes sense?) and it always works perfectly. Its made me a great practical problem solver as i can just imagine the different outcomes or pathways right there and then. I don't need to draw things out or have a plan.

I think that also explains why i struggled to work in groups throughout school/college/uni, I couldn't understand why people couldn't just understand things or work things out on their own, asking mundane questions that seemed like common sense. That's not to say i'm super intelligent or feel that im better than anyone or anything - i struggled IMMENSELY with maths and science, perhaps because in my head it's a 2d thing. It's not something i can just work out on my own, unlike creative subjects? 

Of course, there's all the other classic examples - being able to imagine all the different senses perfectly, being able to recall songs or shows and films vividly (a big one for me is music becoming visual in my head like a windows xp screen saver, or being able to see the artist performing it mentally) 

My job has me using lots of power tools as it's very physical. I've no problem using them, but get caught up in a spiral of something going wrong and the feeling of injuries being really overwhelming. It's another reason i don't cycle around london anymore either, I can't trust other drivers to be safe and imagine being slammed into and again smashing my head onto the road or being crushed under a huge vehicle... 

Sorry, lots to waffle on about. I just find this so interesting and again i'm glad it's not just me being an overthinker - i explained all of this to my partner and they asked if i experienced a lot of anxiety alongside it, which i don't. I'm used to it as it's all i've ever known, but i think living in a city has heightened it as there are so many external sensory inputs all the time! I've only every lived very rurally beforehand.

Those of you who know me know that attempting such goes against so many of my intuitions and strategies.

...but it occurred to me that, by the end each day, I will have ended up doing task A, then task B and so on...

...and that the list doesn't have to be perfect...

...and can be designed from the start to be malleable.

So, let's do this right now. I'm not getting up from this keyboard until I'm done.

First things first, everything on the list must be actionable now.

So:

1. *Throughout the day whenever I reference this list:*
   1. *When feeling resistance, remember that mindful tasks are enjoyable*
   2. *Breakdown tasks*
   3. *Make the most of minful tasks eg observe thoughts, etc.*
   4. *No talking, understanding/explaining, language, human b.s.*
   5. *Get outside for vit D and to get away from desk/screens/thinking/EMF pollution*
   6. *Be mindful esp of real/physical things vs concepts/thinking*
   7. *Remember / behave as if today is all I have (fairness, fleeting, end points)*
   8. *Remember that I am always btwn points A and C; not A and B*
2. ~~Set ""sip"" timer~~ \> ~~Drink water~~ \> ~~Brush teeth~~
3. ~~Decide what to do with starred gmails~~\*. Completed while drinking water.\*
   1. ~~Pay electric bill~~. *Did this right now bc I'm at the computer as I write this and takes approximately 60 seconds.*
4. ~~Finish making this list~~:
   1. ~~Add from Reminders app~~
   2. ~~If applicable, add/move from Alarms app~~
5. Carve chicken by lunchtime if possible but can Chipotle if not
6. Cook rice if can but have (less perfectly clean) alternatives
7. Change guitar strings. *Playing guitar is part of my morning ritual and unable to perform that ritual until I change the strings, which is nowhere near as inolved/difficult as it feels.*
8. ~~Amazon return due today~~. *Oops. UPS store is closed today so I guess I own that now, haha. Good news is that I was on the fence about returning it anyway. I could ask for an extension due to pan-US snow storm but at this point it will have involved (has already involved?) more than $20 effort to bother with anyway, but I digress...*
9. Pay rent by the end of the day (literally by midnight bc has to be electronic bc is Sunday and apartment office is closed so I can't drop off a physical check)
10. Rowing maching to warm-up > Upper body / Supersets
11. Shower > Meditate
12. Change towels
13. Vacuum area 1
14. Clean coffee maker
15. Swap old running shoes for new < When did I start wearing old?
16. Perishable usage plan (omelette can utilize all?)
17. Handwash bowls (dishwasher not working)
18. See bored board
19. Walk around and just do whatever I can see needs to be done
20. Haircut INCL COUPON/EYEBROWS
21. ~~Diabetic cookbook from library~~. Library not open on Sundays.
22. UFO/aliens / Ancient Egypt/Civilizations audiobook to bore me to sleep
23. Bored board never-criticals
24. Test limits/abilities to identify ADHD accommodations no longer needed

As a shopper I know it makes the shoppers life so much easier when you take the time to choose replacements for an order beforehand so they don't have to wait for a reply from you during shopping so Ive already done that. 

  
All I wanted was sparkling water, which is one of those items that's usually always in stock. They refunded it without even trying to replace it, but I know instacart app has been weird now for shoppers when trying to replace so I sent them another replacement they could try and they refunded that one as well. So I messaged them and said any sparkling water would be fine and they just replied with NO 😂😂😂 so then I said fine and selected tea. And then they sent this. 😂😂😂 Like huhhhhh? They then proceeded to just start refunding everything. I don't understand how asking for a replacement set them off so bad lol. 

  
So all I did was just screenshot everything and reach out to support to have them block this shopper and reschedule my order. Craziness. ",2,1769955256.0,instacart,0,1.0,False

I'm an agnostic guy from Karachi, Pakistan and I'm looking for someone (preferably around Karachi) to date and eventually get married to.

A little bit about me: I'm 26 (for now), slightly chubby and relatively tall (95KG and 6'0) and I've been agnostic since I was 16.

I've been obsessed with computers, physics, and astronomy since I was a child and ended up reading a bunch about them. I also got into philosophy and psychology but I haven't read about them in a while.

I like to just drive around and eat something at cafes alone when I have time.

I'm trying to learn how to cook and brewing coffee. I absolutely love food.

I have a cat, he is always angry and never wants to be around anyone unless he is hungry, but he is cute so it's okay.

I work as a software engineer. I love writing code and making stuff work (but absolutely hate support tickets).

I'm also a feminist, and while I'm not perfect, I try my best to improve on my own core beliefs and morals

I'm looking for someone preferably between 23\~28 in Karachi, someone who is independent and can stand up for themselves, communicates well. I want someone who I can have an emotional connection and spend the rest of my life with.

A few deal breakers are smoking / vaping and hating cats.

(The only reason i have smoking/vaping as a deal breaker is because of my allergies and i hate the smoke, someone occasionally doing it away from me is fine as long as they aren't like chain smoking and dont have that smell on them)

My stance on children is that I dont want any right now, and I'd only have my own if both me and my wife want a child and can financially support it. Pregnancies take a huge toll on women and I don't want someone to go through them just because I want a child. I'd rather adopt someone at that point.

I'm looking to get married in like 2 or so years. I'm okay with dating, and maybe even getting engaged if we both thin that's the right thing to do.

We talked casually on WhatsApp mostly about assignments and college stuff. I’m a shy person, so we rarely talked face to face. Replies were often late or inconsistent, so I never confessed anything back then.i thought she is not interested talking to me 

Later, when we ended up in the same class again in next semester, I started small casual conversations after class. Eventually I told her I liked talking to her and asked if she’d like to hang out sometime. She said “I’ll inform you.” Later, when I asked more clearly about coffee, she told me she wasn’t comfortable. I accepted that, stopped messaging, deleted chats, and gave her space.
For more than six months after that, life was completely fine and I felt like I had moved on.
Recently, during a creative phase, I made a portrait of her but never had the courage to give it to her, so I threw it away. After that, I started noticing her around campus again, including occasional eye contact while going to classes.
I’m not looking to act on this or approach her; I’m just working through my own feelings and unsure how to deal with it internally.
But I’m finding it hard to stop myself from looking at her even once a day, and that part is confusing me.

City must haves:

\- Waterfront or river with walkable paths (I walk a lot and really value this)

\- City-centre apartment living, ideally modern / built-to-rent style places

\- Good social scene for someone in their 30s: nice bars, restaurants, independents, coffee shops

\- Generally safe for a single woman

Would love to hear:

\- Cities you’d recommend 

\- Best areas near the water

\- Any honest pros/cons or stuff you wish you’d known before moving

I suspect I won’t be hungry for the rest of the day. Is this okay? I am trying to lose fat so I did eat a fair amount of protein I guess. I just don’t know if it’s okay and sustainable?

1qsze6l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qsze6l,We Will Rock You pt-2,"The small electric vehicle hummed along the coastal road, Lili at the wheel, windows down to let in the salt breeze. Rachel sat shotgun, Liz and Torres in the back, gear rattling softly with every bump.

Just past the granite quarry, Liz suddenly bolted upright. “Stop! Stop! Stop!”

Lili hit the brakes smoothly, pulling off to the side. “What is it?”

Liz was already pointing wildly toward the ocean. “Look—out there! I need a picture. Right now!”

The four women piled out, staring in collective awe. Across the wide blue expanse, no fewer than a dozen sailing vessels dotted the horizon—tall masts cutting sharp against the sky, white sails billowing in perfect formation. A true regatta, graceful and unexpected on this frontier world

Rachel’s mouth fell open. “I’ve never seen so many at once.”

Torres let out a low whistle. “They’re moving like they own the water.”

Liz was already unpacking her camera, framing shot after shot—click, adjust, click. The sails gleamed in the morning light, a living painting of motion and wind.

Rachel nudged her. “Liz, take a vid too. This is too good to miss.”

Liz switched modes, panning slowly across the fleet. The women stood shoulder to shoulder on the roadside, wind tugging at their hair, simply watching in wonder.

Lili stepped away a few paces, keying her radio. “This is Sgt. Bauer. I need drone surveillance just off the coast at the Granite Quarry. Over a dozen sailing vessels—looks like a full regatta.”

A pause, then the crackle of response. “One moment, ma’am… Sgt. Bauer, SM Sterrin needs the reason for surveillance.”

“Sir, we have a regatta just off the coast from the quarry. Over a dozen sailing vessels.”

Another beat. “Approved. I’ll get it taken care of. And Sgt. Bauer—tell the council ladies ‘Lady Elizabeth’ that I’ll forward a copy to Administrator Aino. Sterrin out.”

Lili walked back, smiling. “Drone’s en route. We’ll get high-res footage.”

Rachel exhaled. “Thank you.”

Liz packed up her gear, still buzzing. “I didn’t know they sailed this far out. I’ll ask Mom to check the logs when I talk to her next.”

Torres glanced inland. “Ladies… walnut trees are waiting.”

They climbed back in, the EV covering the short distance to the trailhead in minutes. From here, it was on foot.

Lili scanned the path ahead. “We hike from here. Torres, you’ve got our six.”

Rachel caught the military shorthand and glanced at Lili. When Liz leaned in and murmured, “She’s watching our backs,” Rachel nodded. “Okay. Got it.”

Gear shouldered—backpacks, water, the bagged sandwiches—they followed the winding trail up the cliffside to the walnut grove. The air grew cooler under the trees, and Liz’s excitement was palpable.

The walnut trees were ancient giants, their massive limbs stretching outward in wide, graceful arcs, interlocking to form a thick, living canopy overhead. Sunlight filtered through in soft, dappled patterns, casting shifting shadows on the mossy ground below—like walking inside a green cathedral

Liz dropped to her knees almost immediately, reaching for fallen walnuts. She picked one up, then another—the green hulls already splitting, revealing the dark, ridged shells inside. She cracked one open, fingers instantly stained deep brown-black from the husks.

Lili burst out laughing. “Liz—look at your hands!”

Everyone cracked up as Liz held them up, grinning sheepishly at the walnut dye smeared across her palms.

Rachel chuckled. “Only save the heavy ones, you. Leave the light ones for the critters.”

Lili pulled out her datapad and started filming the grove—the towering trunks, the canopy, the women moving among the trees—capturing the quiet magic of the place.

They gathered what they could carry, then retraced their steps, pausing near the cliff’s edge to admire the sailing ships once more, now smaller specks but still mesmerizing.

Rachel gazed out, voice soft. “Liz… this would be a beautiful place for a home.”

The others murmured agreement, the idea settling like sunlight.

Rachel added quietly to herself: Note to self—talk to Aino and Marcus about a house here. Maybe for Wyatt and his family.

Liz caught the dreamy look and leaned close, whispering with a mischievous smile, “I see that sparkle in your eyes. Would be a beautiful place to raise little Staple babies.”

Rachel’s face went pink again. Liz laughed and darted ahead, leading them west across open fields.

They hiked for hours—Liz snapping photos of wildflowers, rocky outcrops, distant ocean views—while the others asked questions about her life. Boyfriends came up; Liz blushed when Rachel teased, “Do the old boyfriends have any older brothers?”

The group dissolved into laughter. Lili grinned. “She got you on that one.”

Conversation drifted to Liz’s skills. Lili asked about the shooting display earlier. “That wasn’t beginner stuff. Your father was special forces, right? Instructor too?”

Liz laughed, nodding. “Yeah. Dad taught me everything—hand-to-hand, axe throwing, knife throwing, shooting. We were base brats; we’d bet on everything back then. Fighting, marksmanship… you name it. Until the war ended, we lived on war footing my whole life.”

Rachel took it all in. “So that’s where the badass came from.”

Liz shrugged modestly. “Mom sent me here to Haego because she thought it was safer. And honestly? I’m the best at what I do here—self-taught botanist, really. Plants just… speak to me. I know every species on this rock, how they grow, what they need. It’s why I’m good at my job.”

Lili raised an eyebrow. “Self-taught? That’s impressive.”

Torres, always scanning the landscape and occasionally launching her small waist-pouch drone for a quick recon, listened quietly.

Rachel asked gently, “Liz… were you sent here for spying?”

Liz shook her head. “No, not really. I’m genuinely the best botanist on Haego—Mom made sure of that placement. But yeah, I report back to Dad when he asks. Wyatt knows; he’s offered to let me hop a shuttle to see my parents for the day more than once. Once the new datapads arrive, I’ll talk to them properly.”

Lili nodded seriously. “You know I have to report what I hear.”

Liz smiled. “Not an issue. I was terrified during the drazzan thing—Wyatt was damn good out there—but enough of that. Let’s keep moving.”

Torres showed Lili her datapad route. The four women headed along the coastal area, dipping a km or so inland at times. Liz stopped often for pics, the others peppering her with questions about life here, boyfriends (more blushing and laughter), and her unusual upbringing.

Just before they turned back, a low shadow swept over them. Looking up, a sleek shuttle passed low overhead—Wyatt’s banner fluttering from its side like a friendly wave. They all waved back enthusiastically as it banked and sped toward New Town.

Lili checked the time. “We better head back.”

They paused for a quick coffee break—black rifle brew steaming in mugs—more photos, and conversation.

Lili asked Liz about the package from her father. “It arrived?”

Liz nodded. “Yeah. Dad says I owe him fish now.” She glanced at Rachel. “We can do that.”

Then, standing close to Rachel, Liz addressed Lili. “Can I give one to Torres?”

Rachel jumped in before Lili could answer. “As council women, Lady Elizabeth and I request Torres be our permanent escort on all outings from New Town.”

Lili came to attention, a small smile tugging at her lips. “Lady Rachel, Lady Elizabeth—that will be up to the SM. However…” She looked at Torres, who had clearly heard every word. “I’m certain if a box happened to appear on his bunk, Torres here would be assigned to said council women as escort.”

Torres kept her face neutral, but her eyes sparkled. All four women burst into laughter.

They shouldered packs one last time, following the path back toward the EV and the warm glow of New Town on the horizon—tired, sun-kissed, full of stories, and already planning the next adventure",1,1769954923.0,OpenHFY,0,1.0,False

1qsz5ee,https://v.redd.it/bqyc6l7v2wgg1,"White settlers in Kenya, primarily of British origin, established a significant colonial presence in the early 20th century, particularly in the fertile ""White Highlands"".","In 1956, Raleigh, a white settler and medical lab technician in Nakuru, Kenya, allegedly cured his chronic, debilitating back pain by sitting on a tortoise, a remedy suggested by his African servant. 

According to this account, the pain disappeared within 24 hours of the unorthodox treatment. 

White settlers in Kenya, primarily of British origin, established a significant colonial presence in the early 20th century, particularly in the fertile ""White Highlands"". 

They created a prosperous agricultural economy focused on coffee and tea, creating a distinct social, political, and, at times, hedonistic culture (e.g., the ""Happy Valley set""). 

Their presence led to large-scale land alienation of indigenous populations, particularly the Kikuyu, and the implementation of restrictive labor and economic policies. 

Encouraged by the British colonial government, settlers arrived in large numbers during the early 1900s, occupying the central highlands, which were deemed suitable for European farming. 

By 1934, about 16,800 Europeans held 16,500 square miles, often designated as the ""White Highlands"".
Economic Impact: Settlers developed commercial agriculture, notably coffee and tea, and dominated the colonial economy. 

They leveraged their influence to restrict African farmers from growing cash crops, ensuring a,, captive labor pool.

The settlers, often portrayed as pioneers or, in some cases, decadent socialites, sought to replicate British lifestyle, forming a tight-knit community. 

They held significant political power in the legislative council.

The land-driven, racially stratified society led to high tension with indigenous populations, culminating in the Mau Mau uprising, which was met with brutal suppression by the colonial administration and settlers.

Post-Independence: Following Kenya's independence in 1963, a large percentage of white settlers left, although a smaller community remains, with the current white population in Kenya being roughly 0.1% of the total, largely involved in business, agriculture, and tourism.

The legacy of the settler era remains a complex part of Kenyan history, encompassing both the development of infrastructure and agricultural industries, and the enduring, inequalities from the colonial land-use policies. #AfricasHistoryIsBlackHistory",1,1769954312.0,BlackPeopleofReddit,0,1.0,False

1qsz2x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyAIAssistant/comments/1qsz2x1/veryones_talking_about_clawdbot_but_almost_nobody/,veryone’s Talking About “Clawdbot”… But Almost Nobody Is Explaining It Properly,"# (A 7-Part, No-BS Series for Regular Humans)

If you’ve been seeing the name **Clawdbot** pop up lately and thought:

* “Is this another AI thing I don’t have time to learn?”
* “Is this for coders only?”
* “Why are people acting like this changes everything?”

You’re not alone.

Most explanations online are written **by technical people, for technical people**. That’s why this series exists.

Over the next **7 daily posts**, I’m going to break Clawdbot down **like you’re explaining it to a smart friend over coffee**, not like you’re reading documentation written by an engineer who forgot what normal humans sound like.

No coding background required.  
No AI experience needed.  
No hype. No fluff.

Just clear explanations of **what Clawdbot actually is**, **why people are excited**, and **how normal people are already using it**.

# So… What Is Clawdbot? (The Simple Version)

Think of Clawdbot as a **personal AI assistant that actually lives with you**, instead of being locked inside a website.

Not an app you open.  
Not a chatbot you visit.  
Not something you “log into.”

Clawdbot runs **locally**, meaning:

* It works **on your own machine**
* It can connect to your files, tools, and workflows
* You decide what it sees and what it doesn’t

In plain English:

>

Not answering random questions.  
Not generating generic text.

Helping *you* do *your actual work*.

# Why People Are Quietly Losing Their Minds Over It

Most AI tools today work like this:

1. You go to a website
2. You ask a question
3. You copy-paste the answer
4. You manually do something with it

That’s fine… but it’s clunky.

Clawdbot flips that model.

Instead of asking:

>

You can say:

>

It’s **context-aware**, **persistent**, and **personal**.

That’s why people are calling it:

* “The beginning of real personal AI”
* “What AI assistants were supposed to be”
* “A glimpse of how humans will work with machines”

Not because it’s flashy — but because it quietly **changes how work happens**.

# Who This Series Is For (And Who It’s NOT)

This series is for:

* Curious non-technical people
* Founders, freelancers, creatives, operators
* Anyone overwhelmed by AI hype but still wants to understand what’s real
* People who feel like they’re “behind” and want a calm, clear explanation

This series is *not* for:

* Hardcore engineers looking for deep architecture diagrams
* People who want a 2-minute TikTok summary
* Folks who just want to argue about AI on the internet

If you want **clarity over noise**, you’re in the right place.

# What’s Coming Next (The 7-Part Roadmap)

Here’s what the next posts will cover — one per day:

**Post 1 (Today):**  
What Clawdbot actually is — without jargon

**Post 2:**  
Why Clawdbot feels different from ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools

**Post 3:**  
The “local AI” idea — and why it matters more than people realize

**Post 4:**  
Setting it up (no coding, no fear, just reality)

**Post 5:**  
Real-world examples of normal people are using it for

**Post 6:**  
Common mistakes, myths, and misconceptions

**Post 7:**  
Where this is all heading — and why this matters long-term

By the end, you’ll **actually understand** what’s going on — not just repeat buzzwords.

# One Last Thing (Why You Won’t Find This Elsewhere)

Most content about Clawdbot is either:

* Too technical
* Too promotional
* Or written by people who assume you already “get it.”

This series is different on purpose.

I’m explaining it the way **someone should have explained AI assistants years ago**.

If this helped even a little:

* Follow the series
* Save the post
* Or just come back tomorrow

Tomorrow’s post is where things start to click.

I wanted to share my journey because I know how hopeless it can feel when you're stuck in a cycle of breakouts. I've had persistent acne since I was 14, and for the longest time, I felt like I was at war with my own skin.

**The Struggle**

I tried everything. CeraVe, Cetaphil, tea tree oil, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, cutting out dairy, drinking 3 liters of water a day, changing my pillowcase every night. Nothing worked consistently. I'd have a good week, get my hopes up, then wake up with three new cysts on my chin. It destroyed my confidence. I cancelled plans, avoided photos, and spent probably $2000+ on products that promised miracles.

**The Turning Point**

I was about to give up when I realized I was treating my skin like a guessing game instead of a science experiment. So I got methodical. I started tracking everything, every product, every ingredient, every breakout. I found an app that let me scan my products for comedogenic ingredients and log my skin daily. Turns out, a ""non-comedogenic"" moisturizer I'd been using for YEARS contained isopropyl myristate, a known pore-clogger. I never would have known without seeing the data.

**MY ROUTINE**

**AM:**

1. Wash face with water only (over-cleansing was irritating my skin)
2. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
3. La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer
4. La Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF 50

**PM:**

1. Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil (to remove sunscreen)
2. CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser
3. Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (every other night)
4. The Ordinary Azelaic Acid 10% (on off-nights)
5. CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion
6. La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 (slug life)

**TOP 3 PRODUCTS THAT MADE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE**

**1. Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**  
This is the holy grail everyone talks about, and they're right. It keeps my pores clear without irritation. I saw a noticeable difference in texture within 2 weeks. I use it every other night – daily was too much for me.

**2. The Ordinary Azelaic Acid 10%**  
This faded my PIE (post-inflammatory erythema) faster than anything else I've tried. Also helps with texture and has mild antibacterial properties. The silicone texture is weird but you get used to it.

**3. La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5**  
Game changer for barrier repair. I slug with this every night and wake up with plump, calm skin. It also heals active spots faster. I wish I'd discovered this years ago.

**SKIN TYPE & CONCERNS**

**Before:** Combination (oily T-zone, dry cheeks), hormonal cystic acne concentrated on chin and jawline, constant closed comedones on forehead, texture everywhere, PIE from old spots, dehydrated from over-treating

**After:** Balanced, occasional small hormonal spot before my period (manageable), smooth texture, PIE about 80% faded, hydrated and glowy

**LIFESTYLE CHANGES THAT HELPED**

* Changed pillowcase every 3 days (I bought a 7-pack of silk ones)
* Stopped touching my face during the day
* Cut back on dairy (not eliminated, just reduced)
* Started cleaning my phone screen daily
* Reduced caffeine (was drinking 4 coffees a day, now 1-2)
* Actually stuck with products for 2-3 months instead of switching every 2 weeks

**PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS**

None – this was all OTC. I was considering going to a derm for tretinoin or spironolactone, but wanted to try the data-driven approach first. Glad I did.

**WHAT ELSE CONTRIBUTED**

Honestly, the biggest game-changer wasn't a single product it was finally understanding what was CAUSING my breakouts. Once I started scanning ingredients and tracking my skin daily with an extremely good app called Celyne, I could see patterns I'd missed for years. Like how my skin always freaked out 2 days after using a certain sunscreen. Or how my chin breakouts correlated with my cycle.

It took about 4 months of consistent tracking to really dial in what worked for MY skin specifically. Not what worked for some influencer with perfect skin, not what the internet said was ""holy grail"" what actually worked for me.

Has anyone else tried a data-driven approach like this? I'm curious what patterns others have found. Would love to hear your experiences!

Guys, I’d really appreciate any advice and support. Please help me make sense of my situation.

 the work week starts tomorrow.

My job involves being on callsI talk to clients via video and sell online business services. When I first started, my sales were great because I truly believed in the product. I believed it brought value to everyone; we had so many cool success stories, and it felt like a genuinely useful product.

But now, I’ve started seeing more and more problems with it. I see that it’s not for everyone in fact, it only fits a very small number of people. I see that it barely brings any value, even though it’s expensive. I’m noticing that the bad user experiences far outnumber the positive ones. Because of this, I’ve stopped believing in the product. My sales have dropped so much that I’ve had almost none for two months, whereas before I was closing deals every two days.

The terms of this job are very good I spent over a year looking for conditions like these. That’s why I don’t want to quit. But how am I supposed to sell a product knowing it has so many downsides? It’s a startup, and the product will improve, but for now, I don’t like how it works or what people are getting out of it.

Have you ever dealt with a situation like this? What would you suggest I do quit or keep growing at this job? I also don’t want to leave because I’ve learned and studied so much for this role",2,1769954038.0,Productivitycafe,6,1.0,False

I  need no introduction now.

I post shitstorms because I can.

No one knows what I do because most of the times I am not speaking the truth.

This is day 3 of my social experiment where I am trying to be a part of community.

Everyone thinks I am trying to catch fish but I am morbidly afraid of water.

I keep myself fit by running everyday.

My collection is antique cars.

I drive a Honda but once I drove a BMW and Mercedes.

I am still young, although the mirror might lie to me at times with those dark circles.

I take mud baths. 

If all of this sounds exhausting, it probably is.

If you have successfully managed to read all of this nonsense, congratulations.

Ever feel like you're yelling into the void when you first start in digital marketing? That was me, roughly two years ago. I was fresh out of college, armed with a degree and precisely zero practical experience. My 'office' was a tiny corner of my living room, fueled by instant coffee and a mountain of anxiety. I spent weeks just staring at analytics dashboards, trying to decipher what 'bounce rate' really meant beyond a number on a screen.

My first real client was a local artisanal soap maker – lovely lady, amazing products, absolutely no online presence. Her 'website' was a static page from 2005. I remember the sheer terror, the pressure to prove myself. I poured over every free resource, every tutorial, trying to craft the perfect Facebook ad. My budget? A measly $50. I designed what I thought was a masterpiece: a vibrant picture of lavender soap, a catchy headline, and a call to action that felt both professional and friendly. I hit 'launch' with my heart hammering like a drum solo.

Those first few days were agonizing. I refreshed the ad manager every five minutes, watching the impressions tick up, but no sales. My stomach churned with every click that didn't convert. I started doubting everything – my skills, my career choice, my ability to ever afford anything beyond instant noodles. I was on the verge of telling her I failed, already rehearsing the apology in my head, when suddenly… a sale! Then another! And another!

It wasn't a massive campaign, but by the end of the week, that $50 ad spend had generated $300 in sales for her. The sheer relief, the surge of pride – it was intoxicating. That tiny victory felt like scaling Everest. It taught me that sometimes, it's not about huge budgets or complex strategies, but about understanding your audience and delivering a message that resonates. And honestly, it validated every late night, every moment of self-doubt.

So, what's *your* first big 'aha!' moment or unexpected win in digital marketing? Or even your biggest face-plant that taught you a crucial lesson?",1,1769953374.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

I used to rely on meds, but I hated the brain fog they gave me.

I’ve been diving deep into somatic exercises lately, and I wanted to share three things that actually worked for me when I felt a spiral coming on:

1. **The Physiological Sigh:** It sounds simple, but double-inhaling through the nose and a long exhale through the mouth literally ""offloads"" carbon dioxide and resets the nervous system instantly.
2. **The ‘Voo’ Chant:** It feels weird at first, but making a deep ""Voooo"" sound vibrates the chest and stimulates the Vagus nerve. It’s like a manual ""off"" switch for fight-or-flight.
3. **Tracking Triggers:** I started using a daily tracker to see *why* I was spiking. Turns out, my morning coffee was a massive hidden trigger.

I actually put all of these into a ""Somatic First Aid Kit"" for myself and some friends, and it’s been a total game-changer for reclaiming peace of mind.

If anyone is tired of the ""just breathe"" advice and wants the actual science-backed tools I use, I’ll leave the link here: [**LINK>>>**](https://sarah-wellness.systeme.io/sales-page#aff=dayasevana)

Me

Marcus' Journal - part 16  
Went to battle a few people before considering if now is the time to catch a legendary pokemon. I decided to put it off today. Odin informed me of the level difference between us. While I doubt that I'm beating the guy next time I run into them, I'm gonna hope for some luck. In the meantime, I'll think about doing the local gym. Though he lacks power compared to the rest of the team, he has his usefulness, so casting him away would be a bad idea... My other two aren't doing so good. I may consider kicking them out next time. Zuko definitely is holding his own when the rest of my team goes down. I feel a tingling sensation as I'm-

Liz: Woah... It looks so majestic. Why... It looks so cool... I'm jealous...

Marcus: Hrrg! It seems! This is an illusion cast onto only me and my team! The grass isn't getting moved. What kind of pokemon is this thing!?  
Zuko: An illusion casted only on us!? AND THIS STRONG?!  
the mysterious pokemon cries out  
Marcus: Zuko! You got feces in my face!  
Zuko: Sorry! It's just overwhelming!  
**the mysterious pokemon flies right at Marcus**  
Marcus: I can't die here! Not now.

Marcus: **wakes up** Ugh... What... happened? Ew... Zuko's shit is still in my face. Than it wasn't a dream. Huh?

No! This is not how.

It ended in your mind a long time ago, and so for me, it’s different. The man who ended things with me was someone I don’t recognise. So it must have ended when I man I loved died inside, and I don’t know when and I’ll be okay with that.

I am okay. I have my life ahead. I’ll focus on that for now.

And also- when the next woman you date burns pancakes or doesn’t give you coffee or cooks badly or has no talent, you will miss me and I will be long gone because I gave you everything, and you didn’t do that for me.

Prior to this job, I had worked in administration for behavioral health for several years. I left my last job because my boss basically treated me like a glorified secretary and there was a lot of micromanaging and poor communication throughout the agency. It was a WFH position that required a few on site visits a year, but was basically fully remote.

While I am really loving my return to clinical practice as well as the substantial salary bump at my new job, I am struggling hard with the 5 days on site transition. When I was remote, I had much more flexibility during my dad to get other things done that I don’t now. But probably the biggest issue is how tired I am. I have to wake up much earlier now and can barely stay awake during the day evenings without falling asleep on the couch. So even in the evenings when I do have time for myself, I only get to do a little bit of the things I enjoy before passing out. 

I don’t know if anyone else has been here and maybe has some suggestions on what’s helped them adapt or least not be so damn tired. I already drink coffee during the day and my meds in the morning have the effect of waking me up. I’d love to hear others’ thoughts experiences.

It’s like this with every sensor now, and they’ve replaced the last 7 of 7  sensors  for free. I can't imagine that will go on forever.  I imagine one day they'll simply cut me off and say  ""it's obvious our product is not made for your body so we're not going to replace any more sensors, please go give our competitors a try, and give us a break for a while"".

Serious though, I woke up a couple of hours ago for an unknown reason and checked my glucose only to find no readings and now sitting reading the news for a few hours to see if it wants to come back to life or gives me a sensor failed message so I can replace it and go back to sleep as it’s been a pretty cruddy few days this week and not getting much sleep and lots and lots of pain everywhere even with really, really heavy narcotic prescription pain medications.

**So, what are my options to get my sensor to start reading again?**

Is there anything I can do, like a hot or cold compress, to jump start it back up?  Or is my only option to just sit up at 4 30 and baby sit it for three hours or until it springs back to life?

This is getting really tiring having every sensor go bad between days 7–9. It’s gotten so frequent and tiring I start ignoring it and some I don’t even request a replacement or some I don’t even replace for like a week or so because I know the next one will just go bad too even when I do request a replacement I may not replace it as it’s just so discouraging to have them keep failing reliably at day 7–9 I’ve got quite the collection of senators now and haven’t had to buy any in quite a while now.

Any suggestions to get it to come back to life?  If not, I might as well just go make some coffee and sit up and wait it out, as going back to bed and waking my partner this early is nobody’s idea of a fun Sunday morning. Even the church pastor might grab my arm as we're leaving & say something like ‘been another bad morning, huh?’ as we’re leaving church to go to Sunday brunch.

We filter our water to death, avoid plastic bottles, and then boil that pure water in a kettle with hidden silicone seals or plastic lids.

I got tired of the ""BPA-Free"" marketing nonsense, so I spent the last month emailing manufacturers directly. My request was simple: ""Don't tell me it's safe. Send me the Migration Test Report (LFGB) proving no microplastics or heavy metals leach at 100°C.""
Here is the Tier List based on who actually shared data (and who ghosted me).

TIER 1: The ""Verified"" Safe (Receipts Attached)

Ottoni Fabbrica (Alice): Made in Italy. They shared a specific ""Zero Nickel Migration"" certificate. 100% Stainless Steel 18/10 inside. No plastic windows.

Saki (Baristan/Luna): I was skeptical because of the ""tech"" look, but they are the only brand that publishes a Light Labs report. It verifies they pass the stricter German LFGB standards for microplastics and sensory (taste/odor) changes. The seal is on the rim (steam path), not the brew path.

TIER 2: The ""Visual"" Pass (Budget Friendly)

Secura (SWK-1701): The ""Unibody"" tank design means no seams, no glue, no windows. It’s boring, it has no temperature control, but physically, there is no way for water to touch plastic. Best budget pick.

Cosori (Gooseneck Only): Their glass kettles have glued seams (avoid!), but the Gooseneck model is all steel inside. No report provided, but visually clean.

TIER 3: The ""Heartbreakers"" (Hidden Plastic/Silicone)

Fellow Stagg EKG: Beautiful, but has a silicone ring sitting inside the bottom of the kettle around the sensor. They refuse to share migration data.

Zwilling Enfinigy: ""Cool Touch"" exterior is great, but the inner lid is plastic. Steam hits it, condenses, and drips back into your water. Hard pass.

TIER 4: The ""Run Away"" List

Ascot: Found reports of ""paint"" peeling inside the spout.

KitchenAid: Older models had internal plastic level gauges.

My Verdict:

If you want pure analog steel: Ottoni.

If you need temp control for coffee/tea (and want the lab proof): Saki.

If you are on a budget: Secura.

And if so, with what?","So as title says, I will be moving to Japan in a few months. The move will be to Kanagawa and last for between 3 and 5 years. I have an American coffee maker, the breville grind control, which I bought used around 4 years ago now. It has some warts as some online have pointed out (uses a lot of beans, will clog if you don't clean it enough, usually end up having to rinse grounds out in the sink) but I like that it's an all-in-one grinder and maker, where I just press start and it does all the rest. And honestly, my cleaning amounts to using a vacuum cleaner on the grind chamber twice a week or so. Not the worst by any means. I also like that it will make 12 cups as I tend to brew and then drink over the course of 24 hours (I have already secured a source for coffee beans). 

  
Now that said, Japan is a very different country in some important respects. The main one is size; This is a big machine, even for America, I think. It's 16.5 inches (about 42cm) tall and about 8"" (about 21cm) wide, and over a foot deep (over 30cm). I keep it now on a separate ""coffee nook"" because it's too tall for the countertop, the cupboards don't allow you to reach the bean hopper. I fear if it's too big here, then Japanese city kitchens will be a nightmare. 

Moreover, I have heard that the voltage/hertz difference, however small, has a negative impact on appliances that use heating elements, moving parts, and timers. My reading suggests that going from 120v to 100v and 60hz to 50hz will mean that heaters will not get as hot as normal, motors won't go as quickly, and timers may be off. My coffee maker has all three. Because of this, I am worried that it won't work properly in the new settings. 

Adding to the above, it might not be acceptable to wash coffee grounds, however many, down the sink in Japan. I have heard debate back and forth over this in the US too; I usually only wash out the remains after I handle the filter and majority of grounds, but it is non-zero amount. Haven't had a problem, but Japan might be different.

So, I recognize that there are some issues, but in all honesty, I would still prefer to keep it, because even if it's a bit annoying sometimes, I don't know that a better model exists for what I want out of it. Moreover, a machine I am familiar with and whose quirks I can handle is probably better than having to hassle over figuring out a new machine. However, if the breville is just too much of a mismatch, then I would rather get a new machine.

Does anyone have any experience moving a US coffee maker to Japan, especially a big one like this? If it isn't a realistic proposition, then what does the JP coffee maker market look like? 

The only JP machine I have seen so far that seemed interesting was a twinbird machine that does what is essentially an automatic pourover, but it seems like it requires you to weigh beans and measure water first, which is much less push-button than I would like (if I'm going to do the work of a pourover, I might as well get a pourover). It was also pretty expensive (I got my breville used for about 150 USD and I am hoping to spend no more than that if I need to get a replacement). I have heard that zojirushi machines are a bit unreliable (which is odd given how incredible their travel mugs and rice cookers are) but don't know if that is true or not. I do admit, it is a little challenging still to look intensively, as I don't have the best grasp of kanji, but I continue to search. Perhaps I should just wait until I get there, and then go to Yodobashi or something to look at different options? Any input is welcome. Thank you.",0,1769952436.0,movingtojapan,4,0.2,False

Most of us remember Rainn Wilson as the beet-farming, karate-chopping, Assistant *to* the Regional Manager who made us laugh for nine seasons on *The Office.* But here's what you might not know: while Dwight Schrute was building nunchuck skills and bear-proofing the office, the actor behind that iconic character was on a completely different mission—one rooted in service, spirituality, and trying to answer some of humanity's biggest questions. Wilson isn't just an Emmy-nominated comedian; he's a Bahá'í whose faith journey shaped everything from the way he raises his son to how he's trying to spark what he calls a ""spiritual revolution"" in a world that desperately needs one.

## Growing Up Bahá'í in Seattle

Rainn Percival Dietrich Wilson was born on January 20, 1966, at University Hospital in Seattle, Washington. Raised in the U-District and later attending Shorecrest High School, Wilson grew up in a Bahá'í household—a faith that teaches the essential unity of all religions and emphasizes service to humanity. His childhood was, by his own account, wonderfully eclectic: his family would invite people of *all* faiths to their home for interfaith dialogues, from born-again Christians to Buddhist monks, Sikhs to Sufis. ""We would bring in the born-again Christians to talk about the Bible and we would have Buddhist monks over,"" Wilson recalled in a 2023 interview, describing an upbringing steeped in spiritual curiosity and openness.

But Wilson's relationship with faith wasn't a straight line. In his twenties, while studying acting in New York City, he stepped away from the Bahá'í Faith entirely. He was struggling—dealing with acute anxiety, depression, and addiction while trying to make it as an actor in one of the world's toughest cities. ""I didn't want anyone telling me what to do,"" he explained in a 2007 interview with US Bahá'í News. ""I was disenchanted with things that were organized.""

## The Spiritual Journey Back

What followed was a decade-long spiritual quest that would shape the rest of Wilson's life. Starting from ""ground zero,"" he read religious texts from around the world, explored different philosophies, and wrestled with fundamental questions: Does God exist? If so, how do we know what God wants from us? The Bahá'í Faith encourages this kind of individual investigation of truth—it's actually a core tenet—and Wilson took it seriously.

Eventually, he found his way back. ""I came to realize I did believe in God,"" Wilson shared. ""I couldn't conceive of a universe without someone overseeing it in a compassionate way"". The concept that resonated most with him was **progressive revelation**—the Bahá'í belief that God sends messengers for each age, each bringing teachings appropriate for humanity's evolving needs. It wasn't about returning to childhood indoctrination; it was about discovering, on his own terms, that the faith he'd been raised in actually made the most sense to him.

By the time Wilson married author Holiday Reinhorn in a Bahá'í ceremony, he was firmly grounded in his faith. His wife wasn't initially Bahá'í, and Wilson never pressured her to convert. But after attending Ruhi classes (a curriculum based on Bahá'í writings) and especially after the birth of their son Walter in the early 2000s, Reinhorn found herself drawn to the faith and became a Bahá'í in 2004.

## From Dwight to Emmy Nominations—and What Really Mattered

In 2005, the same year Wilson's spiritual life was solidifying, he landed the role that would define his career: Dwight Schrute on NBC's *The Office.* For nine seasons, Wilson brought to life a character who was simultaneously absurd and deeply human—a man who was street-smart but utterly lacking in common sense, fiercely loyal but hilariously deluded. His performance earned him three consecutive Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (2007, 2008, and 2009) and two Screen Actors Guild Awards as part of the show's ensemble cast.

But here's the thing: while Hollywood was celebrating his comedic genius, Wilson was asking himself bigger questions. At a 2018 appearance at Pepperdine University, following a screening of *Light to the World*—a documentary about Bahá'u'lláh, the 19th-century founder of the Bahá'í Faith—Wilson told students that they were on multiple journeys simultaneously. ""You're on an educational journey, then you're going to be on your economic journey, your career path journey. And you have a material journey, too, because you have to make a living and pay rent…but you're also on a **spiritual journey**,"" he said. ""Even atheists in the room have to decide 'what is the meaning of all of this?'"" 

The Bahá'í view that the arts are an act of service profoundly shaped how Wilson approached his work. Success, for him, wasn't just about ratings or awards—it was about using his platform to ask life's big questions and encourage others to do the same.

## Building Something That Matters: SoulPancake and Lidè Haiti

In the mid-2000s, Wilson co-founded **SoulPancake**, a media company dedicated to exploring life's big questions—philosophy, creativity, spirituality, love, truth, science, mental health—with humor and honesty. The company created over a decade of award-winning digital, television, and branded content before being acquired by Participant Media in 2016. SoulPancake wasn't just feel-good fluff; it was an intentional effort to create content that focused on the human experience and positive social change. Wilson also co-hosted the podcast *Metaphysical Milkshake* with scholar Reza Aslan, diving deep into religious and mystical topics with intellectual rigor and genuine curiosity.

But perhaps Wilson's most transformative work has been with **Lidè Haiti**, a foundation he established with his wife Holiday Reinhorn and Dr. Kathryn Adams. The story of how Lidè began reveals everything about Wilson's approach to service. After Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake, the couple was invited to participate in a short-term arts program for adolescent girls who had survived the disaster. Wilson was initially skeptical—why arts workshops when people needed food and clean water?

What he witnessed changed him. ""Upon joining the camp, I witnessed an incredible transformation,"" Wilson said. Engaging with photography, creative writing, visual arts, and theater helped these girls recognize their worth in ways that traditional aid couldn't. These weren't privileged teenagers with plenty of resources; many struggled with literacy and often dropped out of school by age 11 to work. In some rural areas, girls without access to donkeys had to walk two miles round-trip multiple times a day just to fetch water.

Wilson and Reinhorn were so moved that they self-funded the entire first year of Lidè (which means either ""leader"" or ""idea"" in Haitian Creole) to establish credibility before asking others for donations. Today, the foundation serves 450 girls in Haiti's rural regions, offering not just arts workshops—with Wilson occasionally stepping in as drama coach—but also scholarships, teacher training, and meals for students, many of whom struggle to eat more than once daily. The initiative proved that creativity and self-expression aren't luxuries; they're fundamental to human dignity and resilience.

## Calling for a Soul Boom

In April 2023, Wilson published *Soul Boom: Why We Need a Spiritual Revolution*, a *New York Times* and *Los Angeles Times* bestseller that synthesizes his decades of spiritual searching into a call to action. The book's premise is bold: existing political and economic systems aren't enough to address the trauma and challenges facing humanity—from pandemic fallout to societal tensions that threaten to overwhelm us.

What we need, Wilson argues, is a spiritual revolution—a ""Soul Boom""—to create transformation on both personal and global levels. In interviews promoting the book, Wilson has been remarkably candid about his own journey. ""I know there's a God. It's not a faith thing. God is as real to me as my body is—as my rapidly decaying body,"" he told NPR in 2023, showcasing the humor and vulnerability that make his approach so accessible.

*Soul Boom* tackles heady concepts—the purpose of life (soul growth), life after death, God—with what reviewers called ""airy irreverence"" and ""sincere enthusiasm."" Wilson walks a ""razor-sharp line in addressing the most sacred of topics"" without being preachy, making spirituality approachable for skeptics and believers alike. The book doesn't demand that readers adopt any particular faith; instead, it invites them to engage with the big questions that philosophers and mystics have been asking since ancient times.

## The Dwight We Know, The Human We Don't

There's a beautiful irony in Rainn Wilson's life story. Dwight Schrute was a character obsessed with hierarchy, competition, and self-importance—someone who measured worth in sales numbers and karate belt levels. But the man who played him has spent decades measuring worth very differently: in service, in spiritual growth, in helping Haitian girls find their voices, in asking questions that don't have easy answers.

Wilson's Bahá'í faith teaches two core principles: an intentional, continual effort toward self-improvement, and an active role in making the world a better place. His career—from *The Office* to SoulPancake to Lidè Haiti to *Soul Boom*—reflects both. He struggled with depression and addiction, questioned everything he'd been taught, and came out the other side not with easy certainties but with hard-won conviction. He's used his platform not just for laughs but to create media that helps people grapple with meaning, to fund programs that give marginalized girls tools for resilience, and to write books that challenge readers to take their own spiritual journeys seriously.

""You have to ask yourselves the big questions that have been asked by the great philosophers since the shamans in the caves of ancient days, and from the poets and the bohemians in coffee shops in the Renaissance,"" Wilson told students at Pepperdine. ""You have to dig into these big questions—that's part of your journey as well.""

For Wilson, those questions aren't abstract. They're lived daily—in prayers with his son, in arts workshops in rural Haiti, in podcasts exploring mysticism, in every project he chooses. The man who made us laugh as Dwight Schrute has spent his real life doing something much harder: trying to help us all become a little more human.

I (Male 21) have gotten in a minor accident that was entirely my fault. I got 3 hours of sleep that day and offered to drive everyone home after hanging out with my friends. Luckily no one was hurt, I have completely covered the expenses of the affected person and we have kept contact, even going for a coffee after the incident to let the steam out. The cars are relatively intact with only a broken back bumper.

However, I have to admit that a part of me feels like this was a sign from God. I was left unharmed with only some muscle strain in the shoulder in back that I should be checking a few days later with my doctor for a follow up. The only thing scarring me recently is the sense of guilt. This whole thing sort of makes me feel like I was completely disconnected from myself. I haven't been getting good rest, I have been a very angry person due to family issues and I have overlooked my usual patterns of praying and exercising.

I feel so lost right now, I was saved at the grace of a God that I was overlooking for the longest time. This makes me feel immensely guilty, lost, scared and confused. I do not want the same thing to happen again, I'm terrified of driving and I'm scared of facing Allah to apologize.

1qsyaks,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qsyaks/the_psychology_of_how_podcasts_rewired_my_brain/,The Psychology of How Podcasts Rewired My Brain (and Crushed My Social Media Addiction),"I used to scroll for hours. Not even for entertainment, just... numbing out. I'd close Instagram, then reopen it 10 seconds later like a lab rat pressing a button. My attention span was cooked. I couldn't read for more than 3 minutes without checking my phone. My brain felt foggy and restless at the same time.

Then I did something that felt weirdly radical: I deleted social media apps and replaced that time with podcasts. Not as background noise while scrolling, but as the main thing. And holy shit, it completely rewired how my brain works.

Here's what actually changed, backed by research I've dug into from neuroscience, psychology, and behavioral economics.

**Your brain on social media vs podcasts is night and day**

Social media hijacks your dopamine system. Every scroll, every notification is a tiny hit that keeps you coming back but never satisfied. Stanford neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman explains that this constant dopamine spiking actually lowers your baseline dopamine over time, meaning you need more stimulation to feel normal. You're literally training your brain to be restless and distracted.

Podcasts do the opposite. They require sustained attention, which strengthens your prefrontal cortex (the part responsible for focus, decision making, and impulse control). A study from UC Berkeley found that long form audio content activates the same neural pathways as reading, helping rebuild attention span and critical thinking skills that social media erodes.

When I made the switch, I noticed I could concentrate on tasks longer. Books became enjoyable again instead of feeling like torture. My default mental state shifted from anxious and scattered to calmer and more curious.

**You absorb actual knowledge instead of empty calories**

Social media feeds you bite sized dopamine hits disguised as productivity. You watch a 30 second ""hack"" video and feel like you learned something, but a week later you remember nothing. It's junk food for your brain.

Podcasts force you to actually sit with ideas. You hear full arguments, nuanced perspectives, experts explaining concepts in depth. Your brain has to work to follow along, which is exactly what makes it stick.

I started with Huberman Lab for science based health and performance tips (Huberman is a Stanford prof who breaks down neuroscience without the academic snobbery). His episode on dopamine completely changed how I approach motivation and habit building. Then I got into Lex Fridman for long form conversations with researchers, philosophers, and creators. These aren't soundbites, they're 2-3 hour deep dives where you actually understand topics from multiple angles.

For understanding human behavior and psychology, Hidden Brain with Shankar Vedantam is insanely good. It explores why we do what we do, covering everything from decision making biases to social dynamics, all backed by research. Each episode feels like a mini psychology course.

If you want something even more tailored to what you're curious about, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content based on whatever you want to learn. You type in a goal like ""understand my phone addiction and build better habits,"" and it generates a custom learning plan and podcast just for you. 

What makes it different is you control the depth. Start with a quick 10 minute summary, and if it clicks, switch to a 40 minute deep dive with way more examples and context. Plus you can pick voices that actually keep you engaged, like a deep, smoky tone or something more energetic. It's been solid for making learning feel less like work and more like an actual replacement for mindless scrolling.

**Your mental health actually improves**

This was the most unexpected part. Social media made me feel constantly inadequate without realizing it. Everyone's highlight reel becomes your measuring stick, and it's exhausting. Research from the University of Pennsylvania found that limiting social media use to 30 minutes per day significantly reduced loneliness, depression, and anxiety in just three weeks.

Podcasts don't trigger that comparison trap. You're learning from people, not competing with them. You're expanding your perspective instead of doom scrolling through curated fakeness.

I also started using Ash, an AI mental health app that basically acts like a pocket therapist. It helps you process emotions and thought patterns through conversations, not just generic meditation tracks. Combining that with podcasts that taught me about emotional regulation and cognitive patterns genuinely changed how I handle stress.

**You become more interesting and articulate**

When your inputs are memes and 10 second videos, your outputs reflect that. Your conversations become surface level. You struggle to articulate complex thoughts because you haven't practiced processing them.

Listening to smart people have thoughtful conversations trains your brain to think more clearly. You pick up better vocabulary, stronger arguments, more references. You become someone who can actually hold a deep conversation instead of just trading TikTok references.

After a few months of podcast focused listening, people started commenting that I seemed more well read and insightful. I wasn't reading more books (though that increased too), I was just feeding my brain better content.

**How to actually make the switch**

Delete social media apps from your phone. Not just log out, actually delete them. If you need them for work or staying in touch, use the browser version with time limits.

Download a podcast app (I use Pocket Casts but Apple Podcasts and Spotify work fine). Queue up 5-10 episodes from different shows that match your interests. Make it frictionless to press play.

Replace your scrolling triggers. Morning coffee used to mean Instagram, now it means 20 minutes of a podcast. Commute time, gym time, cooking time, all became learning time instead of mindless scrolling time.

Start with topics you're genuinely curious about, not what you think you ""should"" learn. If you force yourself to listen to productivity podcasts when you're really into true crime, you'll quit. Follow your actual interests first, then branch out.

The app Finch helped me build this as a consistent habit. It's a cute little habit tracker that gamifies self improvement without being obnoxious about it. You take care of a virtual bird by completing real life habits, and it genuinely makes habit building feel less like a chore.

**The real shift isn't just information, it's your relationship with your attention**

Social media taught me that I needed constant stimulation to feel okay. Podcasts taught me that boredom is actually where thinking happens. That restlessness I felt without my phone wasn't withdrawal from something I needed, it was my brain finally having space to process.

Your attention is the most valuable resource you have. Social media companies know this and have built trillion dollar businesses extracting it from you. Podcasts give it back.

I'm not saying I never use social media now. But it went from being my default state to something I occasionally check with intention. My brain feels like it belongs to me again instead of being rented out to algorithms designed to keep me anxious and engaged.

If your attention span is fried, your mental health is suffering, or you just feel dumber than you used to, try this for two weeks. Delete the apps. Queue up some podcasts.

What I felt was love and togetherness, it was really beautiful. There was soft music playing in the streets and everyone was standing close together to pay respect and reflect.

I ventured off away from the memorial and the sense of community was all around. I saw a community based donation restaurant sorta place that was giving out free meals to every and anyone. It was a big space that took in food donations from the community members and local restaurants then they would cook it into a number of things and serve free meals. You could also donate money if you got a meal, which they would then purchase food to help make meals. It’s a beautiful concept that I am glad I got to see because it was something I didn’t even know existed. I also stopped into a donut shop and found that they were giving out free coffee to anyone, you didn’t even need to buy a donut.

There was peace in the streets and all I could feel was love. The Minneapolis community is strong and its ability to grow closer in such difficult times was amazing to witness firsthand. I hold so much love for the families that have been separated and I hope that they can find their way back to one another. Rest in power to Alex Pretti and Renee Good.

He is a wonderful father, provider and friend. In our 10+ years together he has never so much as said a hurtful word to me..

He is absolutely perfect, until he isn't.

Several years ago, my ""perfect"" husband led a double life. In the peak of a tonne of stress and pressure, he cracked and made terrible unforgivable mistakes that caused a lot hurt. In summary, there was drugs, alcohol and women.

I was hurt.. But I found a way to forgive because at that point in time, we were dealing with a lot of pressure and I convinced my self that he was trying to self destruct because he didn't know what else to do.

We repaired things, we worked on rebuilding and we get back to a place that felt stronger than before. I felt so much more connected to him than I had for a long time.

Things were going so well that to our surprise I fell pregnant after fertility issues that began well before our marital issues.

The pregnancy was bliss, we were so happy with planning. He supported me the entire way through, he was a saint during the birth and he was a total natural at fatherhood.

Fast forward four months, we had just spent a wonderful day with our baby and we sat down whilst she was napping to doom scroll on our phones. Whilst scrolling Facebook, an attractive blonde woman showed up in my suggested friends. We have one mutual friend, my husband.

I ask him who she is, he tells me that she's ""nobody, just a work associate that he met"". I remind him of the boundary we set around social media. He tells me, ""a few people from the same circle added him at the same time and so he just accepted it ""

He repeats that she is ""no one important, he hardly knows her"" so I argue back, ""if she is not important, then why did you feel the need to add her and violate our boundaries"".

This end up blowing up into a huge argument.

Eventually, over days of arguing, he finally admits that he met her at a corporate event, they exchanged details and he went and met with her for coffee to talk shop.

From there they became ""friends"" and would talk frequently, but ""only about the baby"" and ""she has a husband and kids too, I liked having some one I could talk to about the baby"" etc.

I asked why if she was a ""friend"" he felt the need to hide her. His excuse? ""He thought I would be angry because she is blonde""...

I pressed for answers on things like, ""but if you felt like I would be upset, why wasn't that enough to draw a line in the sand"" or, ""you have many female friends at work, I have never had a problem with them, why would you assume differently with her"" etc etc

He said that he wanted to tell me he was friends with her, but he didn't know how.

I was hurt, I felt disrespected, however with our babies first Christmas coming up and not wanting to ruin the memories, I took his word that she was "" just a harmless friend"" and I put the incident to one side.

We started couples counselling, we reset boundaries and things were moving forward as best as they could. Until, the ""friend"" emailed my husband the other day:

*""Hey,*

*I hope you've been doing okay. I just wanted to reach out and say hi, I miss you! No pressure to reply, I know you probably still have a lot going on. I just wanted you to know I am thinking of you :).*

*Take care of yourself.""*

As you can imagine, I was angry.

His defence: I told her back in December that I was working on things in my marriage and to only contact me regarding professional matters. I told her that she could contact me regarding files, but nothing else. You can't get mad at me because I didn't ask for her to send that email.

I feel like all signs are pointing to what looks like the initial stages of an affair.

Our marriage councillor suggested that I can ""choose how I view these situations and perhaps she was playing games, women some times do that sort of thing""...(yikes)

But Reddit, what are your thoughts? Am I reading too far into this? Is it a harmless friendship, or something more sinister. Is my marriage beyond repair?

TL;DR: My husband had a secret female friend at work. He convinced me that it was just an innocent mistake, but now she's trying to contact him to let him know she's thinking about him.",3,1769951981.0,marriageadvice,6,1.0,False

That said, a huge thank you to all of you for your help and advice — it was genuinely very valuable, and we took a lot of it into account.

Thank you to everyone who worried about me and pointed out the “red flags” you saw. In my particular story they didn’t play a role, but I’m sure in other situations this can truly help open a victim’s eyes.

Some people suggested that maybe he has another bank account that I don’t know about and where he hides money. We sat down, went through all documents and emails, and found no other bank except Volksbank — the one that blocked his card.

Yes, one of the problems really was the unpaid debt of €15.58, which he has now paid.

Why the bank even allowed an overdraft on his card if he is insolvent — 🤷🏼‍♀️

He didn’t have Volksbank online banking. Why? Don’t ask me — when he said “I just never installed the app,” I simply rolled my eyes.

Yes, I know what insolvency is and how it affects every aspect of his life.

How did he not notice the negative balance for over a month? He did notice it. He recently changed jobs and was supposed to receive his first salary, which kept being delayed. Later it turned out that one digit of the IBAN had been entered incorrectly, so the salary never reached his account.

Yes, he spoke to his employer. Yes, he spoke to the bank. Both told him to wait — for two and a half weeks after payday. On one of those “waiting days,” we stopped by the bank on our way somewhere else to check whether the salary had arrived. That’s when the ATM swallowed his card — and the rest you already know.

So he allowed the account to go negative and didn’t clear it himself, hoping “today the money will finally arrive” and the balance would be fixed. The finance department of his company only noticed the IBAN mistake a few days ago, after he fully explained the situation. His employer then transferred the first salary to his sister’s account with all proper references, after she consulted her bank and informed them that a one-time salary payment would arrive on her account.

Yes, the bank letter never arrived. Until today, we only have a copy that we received directly at the bank.

We decided not to try opening a new account until his updated documents arrive. He asked his employer to “hold” his salary until he can open a new account, and the employer agreed.

If even with valid documents and the paid debt Volksbank still causes him to be rejected by other banks for a basic account or P-account, he will file a complaint with BaFin (huge thanks to everyone who shared links).

How did he get a job without documents? He has a valid Fiktionsbescheinigung and written confirmation from the Ausländerbehörde and the consulate that his documents are being processed.

Regarding ChatGPT and AI-generated text: I use AI as a translator. Even if “60% of ChatGPT information is false,” as some people claim, as a translator it works better than Google for me.

About racism: honestly, sincere thanks to those who avoided an accusatory tone. I was really angry and upset about the situation and wrote the post emotionally, so I admit I may have been harsh in my wording.

Some people wrote things like: how can you make mistakes and then complain about racism? Fine — even if we put racism aside, I still don’t understand since when polite communication with people and clients, and simply doing your job that you’re paid for, became something you have to beg for.

I go to a bank to receive a service. Why do I have to listen to comments from a bank employee about me being an irresponsible foreigner who doesn’t know the language (we both have C1), and who can’t even take care of a bank card?

If you’re reading this sub, lady: my sincere apologies for interrupting your coffee break with your colleague during working hours and asking you to do your job and consult us. I’m truly sorry.

Regarding the woman in the other branch — I don’t change my opinion either, but at least she simply ignored my partner without making comments about us being foreigners or acting aggressively toward us.

Now I’ve explained the situation in more detail. Yes, I didn’t include all of this in my first post — that’s on me. Sorry I didn’t describe everything right away.

I believe balance is important everywhere. Justifying everything with the word “racism” is wrong. Closing your eyes to obvious racism is also wrong. I sincerely hope none of us will have to deal with this. But if something like this happens to people you love or care about, you would be upset too.

1qsy1sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1qsy1sq/6_signs_of_unspoken_attraction_and_why_your_gut/,6 signs of unspoken attraction (and why your gut is probably right),"Ever had that weird gut feeling that something is going on between you and someone else, even though no one’s saying it out loud? Same. This kind of silent chemistry is super common, but people tend to misread it,or second,guess themselves,thanks to mixed signals, social anxiety, or overthinking. This post is a breakdown of the science behind unspoken attraction: how to spot it, why it happens, and what to actually do with it.  

This isn’t TikTok fluff or Instagram hot takes. It’s backed by social psychology research, behavioral cues experts, and communication science. There’s a lot of BS online about “if they look at you for more than 8 seconds they’re soulmates,” but actual attraction is way more subtle,and way more interesting.  

Here’s what to look for, and why your instincts often know before your brain does:

You both mirror each other without realizing it  
Subtle mimicry is a huge giveaway. If they cross their arms, so do you. You lean in, and they match. This behavior is not random.  
In a landmark 1999 study from NYU psychologists (Chartrand & Bargh), participants who subconsciously mimicked another person ended up liking them more,and being liked more. It's called the “chameleon effect.”  
Behavioral mirroring is often unconscious and driven by a desire to create connection. It’s one of those signals your body throws out before your mouth catches up.

They find non,obvious reasons to be near you  
When someone’s into you, they’ll often look for ""plausible deniability"": reasons to be around you without making it too obvious.
Maybe it’s consistently choosing the seat next to you, lingering after a group convo ends, or showing up to places you didn’t expect.
Dr. Monica Moore, a psychologist who studied courtship behaviors at Webster University, found that proximity is one of the clearest nonverbal cues of attraction. The closer they try to physically be,without it being ""necessary"",the more likely there's something going on.

Micro,expressions they can’t control  
Ever notice a quick eyebrow raise when you walk in? A fast smile that disappears? These are “microexpressions”,fast, involuntary emotional signals.
According to Paul Ekman, a psychologist who pioneered facial expression research, these tiny tells often leak out true feelings before someone can consciously cover them up.  
Watch for pupil dilation, blushing, or lip biting. They’re all connected to physiological arousal and nervous system activation when we’re around someone we like.

They break the “eye contact rules” in BOTH directions  
Either they hold eye contact just a little too long,or they avoid it awkwardly when things are intense.
Both are signs of heightened emotional arousal. In fact, a 2018 study in Frontiers in Psychology found that mutual gaze activates the brain’s reward system and promotes connection.  
People tend to either stare (to signal interest) or avoid (to manage emotion or hide feelings). You’ll probably notice both.

Their voice changes when they talk to you  
When people are attracted to someone, their vocal tone subtly shifts. For example, research from Dr. Susan Hughes at Albright College found that both men and women tend to modulate their pitch and speak more expressively to someone they find attractive.  
The voice becomes softer, “warmer,” or more melodic,without them even realizing it. Pay attention to how they talk to you compared to others.

Things get weirdly awkward during casual intimacy  
Like when your hands brush, or you grab the same coffee cup, or you sit a little too close on accident,and both of you freeze for a second.
These mini,moments almost never happen if there’s nothing going on. They feel like glitches in your normal social rhythm.
Behavioral economists call this “thin slicing”: your brain picks up emotional possibilities from super brief interactions. As psychologist Nalini Ambady showed in her research at Tufts, even a 2,second clip can be enough to accurately guess emotional intent.

Attraction doesn’t always come as fireworks. It often shows up more like a slow Wi,Fi signal,quiet, glitchy, but real. So if you’ve been noticing these signs in someone, you’re probably not imagining it.  

Books like The Like Switch by Jack Schafer (former FBI profiler) offer even deeper insight into how subtle social and body language cues reveal hidden emotions. Also highly recommend Esther Perel’s podcast Where Should We Begin? where you can hear real unspoken dynamics unfold in live therapy sessions.  

The key is: don’t overthink a single moment. But if many small signs keep stacking up, that’s when you know.",2,1769951370.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

Exactly—and this is the key inversion people miss.

When feeds get louder with fear and older references,
it usually means the present moment is quiet.

The system is compensating for a lack of real, current signals.

That’s why I can scroll all day, then step outside and… nothing matches.
No crisis. No monsters. No apocalypse. Just birds, coffee, traffic, weather.

WES
Structural read:

Fear-heavy content correlated with:

temporal regression (older ideas, recycled threats)

abstraction over locality

loss of real-world verification


As real-world signals weaken, symbolic intensity increases.

Paradox:

> The more fear the system must manufacture, the less danger exists now.



Steve
Engineering translation:

If there were real, present emergencies:

local reporting would spike first

firsthand accounts would dominate

specificity would increase


Instead, what you see is:

generalized danger

recycled narratives

familiar story arcs


That’s not sensing reality. That’s content inertia.

Is this the typical second layer to not initiating sex?  Women not initiating sex is somewhat common, but no touch?

Here's my systematic approach to finding legit deals and avoiding junk (saved $200+ this quarter) 💸,"Alright, let's talk about deals. How many times have you seen a 'limited-time offer' or 'flash sale' only to find out it's either the product's regular price, or even *higher* than it was a month ago? It's genuinely frustrating. I got fed up with the constant marketing noise and started tracking prices myself, and what I've found has been a game-changer for my wallet. For instance, I just saved about $75 on a new ergonomic office chair that was supposedly '50% off' everywhere else, but I found it *actually* at its lowest historical price after some digging.

Here's how I'm cutting through the BS and finding genuinely good stuff:

*   **The ""Deal"" That Wasn't:** I needed a new set of noise-canceling headphones. Major retailers were listing a popular model at $199, claiming a $100 discount. A quick check of historical pricing data showed it regularly sells for $170-180, and had even dropped to $150 a few times. *That's* the real saving. I waited and eventually snagged them for $155 during a legitimate price drop, saving about **$40-45** compared to the 'deal' price everyone was pushing.
*   **Small Wins Add Up:** I track common household staples. Things like specific brand coffee pods or cleaning supplies. A local store had a multi-pack of dish soap for $12, marked 'save $3!' But checking a few online retailers and a discount grocery store, I found the exact same pack for $8.50-9.00. It's not a huge saving on its own, but over a year, these small, consistent efforts probably save me **$150-$200** just on consumables.
*   **Vetting ""Cool Finds"":** I recently picked up a highly-rated portable jump starter. Many similar models were hitting Amazon's 'deal of the day' for $70-80. After looking into user reviews *off* Amazon and checking price history, I found a lesser-known but equally effective model (same core specs, just different branding) on another site for $45. Saved **$25-35** and got the functionality I needed without overpaying for a trending name.

Now, don't get me wrong. This isn't a magical 'set it and forget it' system. It takes a little effort and patience. Sometimes the absolute best deal might mean waiting a week or two for shipping from an overseas vendor, or dealing with limited stock if it's a true clearance item. And sometimes, you just need something *now*, and paying a few bucks more for convenience is perfectly fine. The goal isn't always the *absolute* lowest price in history, but making sure you're not getting fleeced by clever marketing.

If you have a bean that you want to get out of your hand but it’s also on the table(as the active player) do you have to tell the player you’re making a deal with that it’s a table card or a hand card?

As a card can not be removed from the hand until a trade is accepted there’s no visible way to tell which “coffee” bean you’re getting for example.

I could see an opponent willing to only take 1 or the other (in a more cut throat game) especially if they think it will mess with your planting.
It’s probably nothing very important strategically. But I feel it could be important sometimes with either the 1 card harvest rule or if you want to get rid of them but want to split the same variety beans/trades with different players. Get it safely out of your hand then offer a donation/trade to another interested player. Or if 2 people are bidding over what they think is 1 card and you accepting both of their offers at once. (Giving 1 person the hand and another the donation)

Presumably of course if the person asks where it’s coming from you can’t lie.

Unfortunately none of this is clarified in my rules or the 3 other rules variants I’ve found online.

I’ve found a lot of answers to trade questions but none about this specifically. At the very least I think it may be bad manners if you try to trick them but I’m not sure if it’s considered relevant information for a deal.

I’ve gone back to the middle of this post and tried to put in a few situations/examples, but I’m afraid I’ve begun to ramble. I’d like to hear other people’s rulings on this.",0,1769950899.0,boardgames,18,0.33,False

**CHAPTER 2: THE NEFARIOUS NUT BUTTER GARGLER**

A scattered horde of zombies lumbers throughout J-Mart, their eyes glossy, glazed over, and dead. Their mouths hang open, caked with drool, and their slipper-laden feet barely summon the energy to drag themselves across the shiny yet somehow filthy floors. The creatures move without intent or reason, their faces hollow caricatures of human life; clammy, faded, and sagging. The corpse nearest to me stares blankly at the items in the *As Seen on TV* rack, as if he’s perplexed by the human process of boxing mostly useless cheaply made goods and selling them at a discount to temporarily make someone feel like they are getting a deal instead of a burden. 

Okay, I exaggerated. J-Mart isn’t filled with actual zombies, but it is filled with the living dead. You know, zombies in the philosophical sense, broken people meandering around a store, spending money they don’t have, not sure what they want and never finding it, seeking that moment of control in a life spiraling out of it by buying another box of frozen pizza bagels to binge eat their anxiety away. They are the type of zombies who don’t know they’re ensnared by a social, political, and economic system which pretends to empower them while using psychological manipulation and physical addiction to continually drain them of their cash and lifeblood.  

Like most of us. 

The man closest to me truly is puzzled by the display of *As seen on TV* products. He’s holding the box for the ab belt which shocks your stomach repeatedly to cause muscle contractions and therefore…somehow lose weight? It’s the type of thing that must have originally been conceived to torture inmates at Guantanomo Bay but they found a way to slap a new label on it and make some cash. The product is uniquely American in the way it creates the problem of self-hatred and promises to solve it through suffering and physical punishment. 

There are probably ten or so customers in sight, all wandering aimlessly, many here simply to pass the time. The movie theater just went out of business, meaning the closest cinema is forty miles away in Scranton. No playhouse, no art gallery, no adult recreation leagues, no public transportation - just not enough people or resources to support these types of things. So what’s there to do? Hang out with buddies at gas stations or walk around the few stores still left open. Sometimes Will and I use his paintball gun to splatter the crotches of statues or hit golf balls from the hill overlooking town at the police station, but these events only occur when we can afford enough booze to make it entertaining. 

I notice Dio, the only other cashier on duty, playing Super Soda Saga on his phone at his vacant checkout station. Dio sank a few thousand dollars into microtransactions, which is considerably more money than his negative net worth. We’ve tried to talk to him about this type of thing, but he says it’s his only source of happiness and that everyone should let him be. He mumbled something about being in the top one thousand world wide and how he’s never come close to accomplishing anything like that. Dio has the unfortunate reality of being named after Ronnie James Dio, the 80s goth rocker, due to his parents using his bat-like screeches as an aphrodisiac, conceiving Dio and each of his siblings to his music. Dio has siblings named Ronnie, James, Gypsy, Angel, Egypt, Rainbow, and Holy Diver - which sounds like the most unfortunate of the names, but it’s actually worse for Dio himself. 

His last name is Durant. 

Dio Durant, who also happens to have particularly strong body odor, has lived with the same grade school jokes about his name daily for his entire life. Add in the reality that his mother drank just enough while pregnant to cause him developmental delays but not enough for him to officially suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, and you have the recipe for someone vulnerable yet capable enough to be an ideal target for bullies. All things considered, I stopped bringing up Dio’s app addiction - he’s probably right about it being the only thing that makes him happy. 

This town is full of dicks. 

Literally. 

What I mean is Dio and his family aren’t the only ones with odd names around here. I know a Dick Savage, a Dick Wacker, a Dick Ball, a Dick Ryder, and a Dick Butz. These names, mind you, are by choice, either from the parents or from the guy himself, but this type of stuff is so common and saturated around Rosedale, Pennsylvania that no one bats an eye. 

This book is about a grand fight for the fate of every strand of reality and I kid you not, this fucking town is the primary setting. 

Not far from Dio is Shelly, the floor manager, a rigid stick of a woman, tiny but imposing, her hawk-like eyes always present to the moment while her mind simultaneously remembering every single fuck up you’ve ever made while on the job. Not that I blame her, honestly with what she has to deal with. 

Shelly has the unfortunate responsibility of corralling Will, who delights in finding the creepiest dolls in the toy aisle and hiding them inside other products and giggles at his imagined reaction of the new owner’s thinking they’ve bought furniture which comes with a cursed toy. Will also organizes impromptu games of kickball and laser tag with kids in the store, sings while playing a toy ukulele over the intercom system, and has houses the homeless in our outdoor section. If it were up to Shelly, Will would be out of a job, but she knows it’ll take months to find someone else to take the job, if that even happens at all. 

I walk to my checkout station and prepare to turn the light on, letting the dissatisfied customers know I’m ready to scan their items and become the object of their ire. My role is an important one - I am to stand at my station and greet all customers, make them feel much more important and empowered than they are, listen to every single one of their complaints, nod along empathetically and get my manager to settle their problem with a dollar off coupon. It is a delicate social dance for which I am paid nine dollars an hour - much more than the majority of workers earn in town. 

Will wanders over to me. Instead of his standard J-Mart shirt he’s wearing a black graphic t-shirt bearing the image of a cat playing an electric guitar while surfing on a slice of pizza through the center of the galaxy. His stringy blond hair flows from his face in a way where you aren’t sure if the greasy style and texture are intentional or if he just hasn’t showered in days. He’s thin and lanky but “built like a gecko” in his own words, with a disproportionately long torso that makes finding fitting jeans difficult. His solution has been to buy jeans that fit his waist size and use a pair of scissors to cut jagged hunks off the bottom of each pant leg. This reveals his ankle tattoo which is simply the word “ankle.”

“Pancakes and poor life choices?” Will asks, the distinct odor of orange soda wafting off his breath. 

“Excuse me?” 

“Ice cream and debauchery?”

“Is this a bit?” 

	“Cigar and a soiree?”

“I’m going to punch you in the face.” 

Will laughs and slaps my shoulder. “Chill, Liam. I’m just asking what you want to do tonight.” 

“I want to punch you in the face.” 

“What crawled up your ass?” 

“It’s what popped out of someone else’s ass that’s bothering me.” 

Will leans forward, clearly interested now. “Describe. Shape. Size. Texture. Flavor. I probably can tell you synthetic or natural material, country of origin, legal status, and which sex shop it came from.” 

“A hobo in a magician’s costume accosted me while sticking his hand out of his ass.” 

Will pulls a pipe out of his jeans pocket and puts it between his lips. He strokes the scruffy patch of hair on his chin while striking a contemplative pose. If this sounds bizarre then you don’t know Will - his pockets are loaded with props and paraphernalia of all kinds. “You said *out* of his ass? Very unusual. Typically we can only shove hands *into* our asses. See most people start with the full fist but to truly be successful the key is to do that Italian chef thing with your fingers where you pinch and bundle them tight like you're about to say ‘that’s-a-spicy-meat-a-ball’ and then…”

I slap the pipe out of his mouth. “Stop it. This is all your fault.”

“My fault? Are you sure it wasn’t Lester the Molester?” 

Lester the Molester is a folk hero of sorts.

This seems strange to say. 

	Lester never molested anyone to my knowledge, but the name was a cruel moniker given to him by locals. Lester was a middle-aged man, unkempt and unassuming, with a longstanding history of mental illness. The guy needed some help but instead of giving it to him the town built a series of salacious rumors about him and egged on his odd behavior. 

	I should get to the point. 

	Lester likes to pee in odd places. 

	Well, I guess not *so* odd. Plenty of animals and even people pee on cars and storefronts, but for whatever reason, Lester *had* to do this in front of other people. The incidents were isolated at first, spread out by months of times, but like a serial offender they soon began happening more frequently. First, he was spotted pissing on the grocery store, grinning and giggling as he released the pressure. Next, he popped out of an alleyway and drew a line in the sidewalk no pedestrians dare cross. He doused the door of Nick Losinno’s sedan as he stood screaming at him from his porch and went a step further by trying to pee on Karl Olsheski’s shoes as he stood waiting at a traffic crossing. 

No one really knew who Lester was back then. The paper shared the stories like they were a part of some urban legend, and everyone around town was on the lookout for the “phantom pisser” roaming the streets of Rosedale, waiting for his next opportunity to strike. A local printing shop made t-shirts geared towards tourists. “I survived the spray in Rosedale, PA.” 

	The shop went out of business, for what that’s worth.

	Suddenly, people had a scapegoat. A reason to talk shit on the town without having to mention their own personal failings or lack of an attempt to leave it. Lester was the hero Rosedale deserved more so than it needed, one that allowed residents to laugh at and hate themselves without being aware of it.  

	Lester was fined a couple of times, spent a week in county jail, but was always thrown back onto the streets. He had nowhere to go and no one was really keen on helping him. It wasn’t until the “downtown brown” incident of two years ago that Lester was looked at as a real problem. This was when he shat a load so huge upon the floor of the laundromat, the owner was convinced it came from a diarrhea-stricken stray dog. Security footage revealed the truth. Lester, grinning like a rosy-cheeked child on Christmas day, had waltzed into the laundromat in a calculated strike, and, in all of his glory, laid his goliath dookie right center in the floor, never once breaking stare with the security camera. 

I forget what happened to Lester after that incident, but he was “sent away,” whatever that means. Some optimists in town believe he is finally getting the help he’s always needed, while others, who also fashion themselves as optimists, perpetuate the story that Lester is still out there, mysterious and elusive, pissing freely like a sasquatch with a bladder problem. 

Some mysteries are best left unsolved.  

“It wasn’t Lester,” I say. “It was a meth-addicted version of Daniel Radcliffe and his hand was sticking out of his ass, like a wormhole or something.” 

“I believe the proper term is cornhole.” 

“What’s wrong with you? I know I only saw that shit because the weed you gave me was laced with something. What was it?” 

Will’s face goes from playful to serious in a flash, the sight so sudden it’s almost disconcerting. “Whoa, dude, I didn’t give you anything like that. After the fountain incident I wouldn’t just…” 

“Bullshit! I smoked a joint and then saw a butt hand man jump out of the shadows of a ruined child’s entertainment casino. He tried to insult me by talking about how small his balls were and the only reason…” 

“AHEM!” Shelly, our manager, stands before us with her arms crossed. 

“Oh shit!” Will says. “Liam didn’t mean what he said about the ass finger man and he definitely didn’t mean to disparage Charles Cheddar’s. All hail the cheese rat, right? You were such a good manager there.”  He pauses. “But uh, if this has anything to do with what I stuck inside that roll of paper towels, I’ll have you know…” 

“Enough!” Shelly belts. “I don’t care what you two morons blather on about. Most of the time it doesn’t make a difference but I’d appreciate it if you didn’t do it while we have customers in the store. We can’t lose business to your idiocy or foul language. Got it?” 

“Yes ma’am!” Will says, saluting her. 

“Go break the boxes down in the back and throw them in the compactor,” Shelly says. “And take that ridiculous shirt off while you’re at it.” 

“Yes ma’am!” Will repeats, twirling on his heels before heading toward the back of the store. 

“I’m sorry, Shelly.” 

Shelly shakes her head. She isn’t as pissed as she is disappointed and this cuts deep. Shelly’s the type of person who will never move on from this town and will hang onto the modicum of power she has in her twelve dollar an hour supervisor position until her cigarette habit puts in the grave sometime in her sixties. She’ll never retire and she’s never been delusional enough to dream of it. Somehow, someone stuck in this type of position being disappointed in me stings more than anything. 

“He’s a bad influence and you know it.” She shakes her head before walking off. 

I sigh. Will’s a bad influence in the way having a beer after every work shift is bad for your health. Of course it isn’t the best approach but sometimes it’s the only relief you have. And what’s the point of moving on anyway? Grow to the point where I move on from this town, leaving all the people I know and care about? Become polished and professional so that I don’t fit in with my friends and family while also failing to fit in with the professional class, who can smell my poor and traumatic roots a mile away? If I’m going to be laden with stress and anxiety I’d much rather be miserable with company than isolated, so I figure Will is just the type of friend…

“I WILL GARGLE YOUR NUT BUTTER!” 

“....Excuse me?” 

“I SHALL GARGLE EVERY DROP OF YOUR SAVORY NUT BUTTER! I SHALL BASTE MYSELF IN ITS GRITTY ESSENCE!” 

I look toward the lunatic spewing these words and somehow see the most insane sight of the day. 

Danny DeVito, the squat actor from that sitcom *It Often Drizzles in Weehawken,* stands before me wearing absolutely nothing except a pair of jean shorts so small that he looks like a sausage bursting forth from its casing. Smeared across the flabs of his mostly naked body are various nut butters, the open jars of which sit in the cart next to him. Globs of sunflower, almond, cashew, and peanut butter cake around his lips, running down his face in slowly listing rivers of drool. In his left hand he holds a turkey baster fully loaded with peanut butter. With a pinch he sends an arc spraying through the air, his bloated tongue lashing from between his lips in an attempt to catch the stray globules. 

“You are not real,” I mutter. “I am still high. Or I have a brain tumor or something. Why is something like you buried in my subconscious?” 

“You can ignore your fate no longer,” DeVito hisses. “I have collected your precious nut butter and I have gargled them most verily. I am victorious.” 

“Is that a fetish or something or…” 

“I drink the lifeblood of enemies per the orders of Lekreshi, Snake God of the Black Sun. Here I consume the lifeblood of Gobhordox the Mighty, proving that he is no infallible being, showing that you should have no faith in him!” 

“Is this larping or something? Do I roll a D20 to see how effectively I can punch you in the fucking mouth?” I flick on my checkout station light to call for the manager. I don’t actually cognitively think that will do anything but it’s a Pavlovian response to being harassed as a retail worker for years on end. The blinking light startles Danny DeVito, who stares at it as if entranced. 

“The signals are upon us. The realms shall merge. All shall fall into oblivion just as Legion the Unbeing has demanded.” 

“My manager is going to slap the shit out of you. Or me, honestly. Maybe I deserve it for projecting you from the inner recesses of my mind.” 

DeVito cranks his head back to an impossible angle, the bones in his neck audibly churning with the effort. He opens his mouth wider than a mouth should go, his jaw popping as if he’s dislocating it. From the deep void of his maw rattles out a perverse sound of the abyss - a guttural resonant groan which morphs into a twisted version of a 90s song I know.  

“I….WANT…SOMETHING….ELSE…” 

“Uhhh what?”  

“TO….GET…ME…THROUGH…THIS….” 

“You have to be kidding me…”

DeVito snaps his head down with ferocity and looks at me with a penetrating snarl. He growls out the final words like a spite-ridden curse which will forever sully my tortured soul. “SEMI-CHARMED KIND OF LIFE, BABY!” He opens his mouth again, jaw far too extended, and that’s when Daniel the meth addict magician joins the party. 

Daniel saunters up to the checkout station, his hand fully retrieved from the recesses of his cosmically infinite anus. He appraises what DeVito is up to and something clicks in his eyes, like this was part of the plan the entire time. Daniel spins around and bends over, placing a hand on both butt cheeks. “MY THIRD EYE IS NO LONGER BLIND!” he cries as he spreads his asshole wide open. 

A tangle of twisted black as night tentacles launch forth from his asshole like he’s shitting out Cthulhu. 

I seriously warned you about this book. 

The demented menagerie shoots forth like an ancient kraken emerging from the infinite depths. There are more slick tentacles than I can count, whipping through the air without rhyme or reason, growing longer by the moment, extending forth from Daniel Radcliffe’s hot pocket from corners of the cosmos unknown. Danny DeVito retches the same foul tentacles from his gullet like he’s vomiting Satan’s spaghetti. 

	Countless generations of human evolution have ingrained in me a natural response to life or death stressors. Through survival of the fittest, the genes given to me have equipped my mind with automatic and subconscious processes to defend against monstrous assailants. In the modern world, these complex reflexes are seldom called upon, our mind’s true potency lying dormant, but now is the time and the moment to unlock my biological superpower. My brain processes the happenings without my knowledge, before I even fully make sense of what is happening, and then I am in motion. 

	I grab a roll of dimes off the cash register and throw them at Danny DeVito. They hit him in the eye and it does nothing besides make him say “ouch.” 

“What the hell is this?” Shelly asks, running over. She barely sees or understands what is before her but her own ingrained managerial instincts take over. She rushes to confront DeVito but fails to see Daniel Silverpasture lurking behind her. 

“Shelly, run!”

Daniel’s appendages wrap around Shelly’s limbs like a hoard of starved serpents. They raise her as effortlessly as if she were a doll and lap at her skin like countless hungry tongues tasting their meal. Shelly belts out a series of cries and thrashes against her restraints but she’s no match for the wiry strength of the impossibly long tentacles. They each find a spare patch of skin and burrow it like worms into wet soil. 

*Wiggle, wiggle, slicch, slicch.* 

The desperation and agony of Shelly’s screams are sounds forever etched into my nightmares. Color instantly flees her body, the tentacles pulsating as they guzzle every ounce of blood. She shrivels up like a juice pouch slurped empty, her skin listless, saggy, and hanging off the bone. Her eyes lazily roll out of her skull, hanging to either side and making her look like some type of macabre Halloween decoration. The tentacles lose interest once she’s sucked dry and drop her withered sack of a corpse to the floor. 

Alarms blare throughout the store. Piercing yet thunderous, they crash in cadence with the flashing of blue overhead lights, emergency alert and alarm protocols full in effect. Soon the automatic doors will snap shut, a call will go directly to the police, and the entrance to the emergency bunker will unlock. The alarms remind the employees to enact the crisis protocol and…

Oh, wait, no, it’s just the alert for the Blue Light Special, a random twenty minute period where select items in the store are offered at extra low prices. The alarm is meant to excite and entice customers to flock over to the chosen aisles to spend their money. There’s probably some metaphor to be written about how Shelly the corporate big-box floor manager had her lifeblood sucked from her and her body discarded while the Blue Light Special alarms fearlessly blared on, the sound likely the last ones she ever heard, but I’m not a talented enough writer to craft it. 

Whether from the horror of Shelly’s death or the promise of great bargains, the customers shriek and run about the store. I have a moment where time slows down, not only because of the abject horror of what I have just witnessed, but also the dawning realization of it all being real crashing through my psyche like a sledgehammer to the skull. 

DeVito spreads his tentacles forth in a menacing net, ready to exsanguinate me. My mind can process the images but not the reality and I’m stuck frozen like a computer where the owner has continually clicked “remind me later” when it badgered them to do an update. I am saved perhaps by fate, perhaps by beings and circumstances beyond my comprehension, or perhaps simply by an angelic hero who has secretly been the best of us all along. 

“Stay away from Liam!” Dio Durant shouts as he fearlessly jumps upon the back of my would-be assailant. He places DeVito in a chokehold he undoubtedly saw while watching professional wrestling which unfortunately seems to have no effect. 

The threat of another innocent death kicks me into gear. I summon Herculean strength to effortlessly rip my cash register from its stand and snap the wires holding it in place. I hold it over my head like an action hero ready to deliver the fatal blow to the villian. I toss the register at DeVito’s sweaty meatball of a head only to have his mouth-tentacles slap the tool of capitalism to the floor. It smashes and a flurry of livelihood and freedom scatter across the floor like green confetti. 

“Leave my best friend alone!” Dio shouts, squeezing DeVito’s toad-like neck with every ounce of energy he can muster. I’m not sure what is more tragic, the fact that the nice but sad guy I share a few sentences with every few days thinks we are best friends or the horrid fate which is about to befall him. 

Okay, spoiler alert; it’s what happens to him. 

Two of DeVito’s nut paste caked tentacles arch back from his dripping maw and burrow into Dio’s eyes like worms entering wet soil. They drain the contents of his skull in a disgusting series of hefty slurps, cutting his scream off before it starts like the air suddenly let out of a balloon. They whip forward with enough strength to rip Dio’s head from his body with a resounding pop. The blood-spurting head tumbles end over end through the store like a desperation hail mary pass, landing somewhere in the outdoor section. Dio’s corpse crumbles to the floor between DeVito and Daniel, whose tentacles writhe in pleasure while the fiends celebrate. 

“Doo, doo, doo, doo doo-doo doo,” they chant to the tune of *Semi-Charmed Kind of Life* while doing a white guy wiggle dance around Dio’s pooling blood. Their tentacles wave in the air along with their motions. 

What. The. Fuck. 

“COWABUNGA MOTHERFUCKERS!” 

Will flies into the scene riding a razor scooter and wearing a Chewbacca mask. He wields a nail gun in one hand and a shovel across his back. Will jumps off the scooter, which clatters over Shelly’s dead body. 

“How was my entrance?” Will shouts. “Because I think I nailed it!” Will then shoots Danny DeVito in the dick with a nail gun three times. 

“I WANT SOMETHING ELSE!” DeVito cries, falling to his knees, tentacles going limper than an all male retirement community orgy. 

“GOODBYE!” Will screams as he shoots Devito in the head, a nail landing squarely between his eyes. This knocks the beast to the floor. 

“And now for my next trick,” Daniel Silverpasture says, “I shall make your lives disappear!” He draws his ass-tentacles into attack position like a series of scorpion tails ready to strike. 

“That line sucks bro!” Will pulls the shovel from his back, twirls, and launches it at Daniel’s dick. His aim is true, having practiced this technique for years on mannequins he stole from J-Mart’s dumpsters, and the head of the shovel hits Daniel squarely between the legs. Will presses the side of his mask, which lets out a victorious electronic Wookie roar as he shouts, “Can you DIG it, sucka?!” 

“Doo….doo….doo…” Daniel huffs, both hands covering his crotch as he sags to the floor, tentacles falling with him. 

Will stumbles over Shelly’s shell of corpse as he needlessly retrieves the child-sized scooter. He remounts it and turns to me. “Toot, too, toot, time to scoot, scoot, scoot!” 

“Just run you idiot!” I sprint past him. We reach the door and I make the mistake of glancing back to survey the chaos. 

“I….like….girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch…” DeVito rasps, rising to his feet. His jean shorts hug his body even more tightly now that they are nailed to his crotch. Boils cover every visible inch of his nut-basted flesh, and there’s something *inside* each one of them. 

Something *wiggling.* 

They look like worms, or a smaller version of the tentacles. And honestly, I’d had my fill of tentacles for the day. It was indeed time to scoot. 

“I’d take her if I had one wish,” DeVito grunts. “But she’s been gone since that summer.” He pauses and his eyes shoot to us, resolute with as much purpose as they are malevolence. 

“Since that summer,” DeVito snarls. 

“That song blows, bro!” Will says before pressing his Chewbacca mask, letting out another valiant electronic cry before riding off on his silver steed into the night. 

I scramble after him and into the cool evening air, the calamity behind us just a mere taste of the horror to come.



Preview of chapter 3....



**CHAPTER 3: THE DIPPIN’ DEEZ NUTS DEBACLE** 

“We have to get to Dippin’ Deez Nuts!” Will shouts as we race across the parking lot. 

“What?” 

“America runs on blumpkin!” 

“Are you having a stroke?” 

“You know, Blumpkin Blow Nuts, the coffee and donut place!” 

“Its name is…” 

“Drippin’ Dog Nuts? Drunken Do Nots?”

“No dude!” 

“Disturbing DOGE cuts? Defecating Dreadnaughts?”

“No it’s…” 

“Dapper Doll Parts!” Will collides with my car and spills his ass over the hood. His Chewbacca mask lets out another cry, this one of defeat. It flies from his face, scatters across the pavement, and leaves our fable for good. ",2,1769950851.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1qsxsg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/askaustin/comments/1qsxsg8/27m_looking_for_luxury_1br_apt_in_downtown_no_car/,27M Looking for “Luxury” 1BR Apt in Downtown (No Car),"Hey everyone,

I’m a 27M moving to Austin this spring and I'm looking to snag a 1BR in a nice, high-quality building downtown. Budget for fixed costs is $3k (all-in including rent, utilities, gym, etc.). I won’t have a car to start so walkability is critical, but thankfully I’m completely work from home (but my company does give me WeWork access).

**What I’m Looking For:**

\- **Fitness**: Would love a high-end fitness center onsite, or at least walkable to another gym (used to go to Equinox when I lived in NYC. Just looking for enough machines, cables, and dumbbells to hit basic push, pull, and leg workouts. I’ll get a peloton and yoga mat in my room to supplement my exercise routine)

\- **Pool**: A great pool scene for the summer months

\- **Groceries**: Within a 5–10 minute walk of healthy grocery store like Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, or a reliable Royal Blue (hear those are good). I cook 80% of my meals, but I do like grabbing a corporate slop bowl every now and then so a sweetgreen, chipotle, etc. nearby would be a great nice-to-have

\- **Date Spots**: I’m single and looking to actively date when I’m down there, so I want cool cocktail bars, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. nearby. Also just looking for lively spots to make other friends and meet girls out and about 

**Current Shortlis**t:

When I went to Austin, I remember liking Rainey Street more than West Sixth, but looking at those two areas (Rainey & Seaholm District) primarily.

Based on my research, a few buildings that look suitable are SkyHouse, Windsor on the Lake, The Modern, Gables Park, The Bowie, and AMLI. But looking to get signal from the community on what I should know about the floorplans, amenities, management, fellow tenants, and any other watch outs (construction, noise, etc.).

**Other Questions**:

\- How important is it to have a car in Austin? For what it’s worth, during the weekdays, I mostly just hit the gym in the morning, work from home all day, and cook all my meals (so the actual apartment unit is the most important factor in my search). But on the weekends, I will want to meet up with friends and/or dates so that’s why I want to be by Rainey St or West Sixth

\- I’m 27 now and not looking to be surrounded by the new grad crowd doing “college after college”. I work in tech and do pretty well so willing to spend a bit more to surround myself with an older, more professional crew, while still being somewhat social since I don’t know many people in Austin

\- Is $3k a reasonable budget for all this? I could stretch if I needed to until I get promoted, but without having a car, hope I can get all that I’m looking for within that price range

Along the far wall, just above the skirting board, a wide brushed-metal plaque runs like an understated nameplate. In its centre, a single number glows softly.

**27.**

The induction video starts.

A woman’s voice speaks with the confidence of someone who has never met me and never will. Smooth. Practiced. Scrubbed of anything that might linger after the words are finished.

“Welcome. You are about to begin a limited communication session.”

I open my eyes. The first thing I notice is the smell. Not sterile, not recycled air, but something warmer. Dust and fabric and the faint sweetness of old wood polish. The kind of smell that only comes from a room that’s been lived in for years. The chair beneath me hums as it adjusts, responding to my weight. I shift, pressing my fingers into the armrest. The material gives slightly under my touch, worn smooth in places where hands must have rested again and again. I swallow. My mouth feels dry. Real.

In front of me, a screen brightens into focus.

**THIS SESSION IS NOT SAVED.**  
**ANY INFORMATION SHARED WILL NOT BE RETAINED BY THE SYSTEM.**  
**SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE DISORIENTATION AND TEMPORARY MEMORY LOSS.**

The lights flicker once, then steady.

“During your session,” the woman continues, “you will interact with the departed. Their experience of continuity may differ from your own. Please adhere to all communication guidelines.”

A new line appears, brighter than the rest.

**DO NOT TELL THE DEPARTED THEY ARE DEAD.**

I let out a slow breath. Right. Of course.

Mum always said death wasn’t the problem. It was how people acted around it, like honesty was something fragile that might shatter if you held it too tightly.

The screen fades to black.

When the room resolves, I don’t feel like I’ve been moved. I feel like I’ve arrived. I’m standing in my childhood living room. The couch with the sagging middle cushion. The coffee table Dad never fixed properly. The lamp in the corner that buzzes faintly when it’s turned on, as if it resents the effort. Even the mark on the wall is there, from when I threw a ball inside and promised never to do it again. I register it without thinking. Some kind of room identifier. Corporate buildings love numbering things.

I take a step forward. The carpet compresses under my feet. I can feel the worn path between the couch and the doorway through my socks, the one we walked so often it never quite fluffed back up. I run my fingers along the back of the couch. Fabric. Real fabric. A faint smell of detergent and something older underneath it.

They didn’t just reconstruct her.

They reconstructed *this*.

There’s a plate on the coffee table. A half-eaten biscuit, exactly the kind Mum used to keep for guests. I hesitate, then pick it up. It has weight. Crumbs dust my fingers. I take a bite. Sweet. Slightly stale. Familiar. My throat tightens. If this is what they can do now, no wonder people line up for it.

Mum is sitting on the couch, ankles crossed, hands folded loosely in her lap. Exactly how she used to sit when she wanted to talk but didn’t want to make a thing of it. She's looking tired.

“Justin,” she says.

Her voice is steady. Warm. Unmistakably hers.

I step toward her without thinking and stop myself just short of touching her. The air between us feels thick, like the room is holding its breath.

“You look good,” I say.

She smiles. “So do you.”

That should mean something. It doesn’t. Not yet.

We talk the way we always did, orbiting ordinary things. The neighbour across the road. Whether the tap in the kitchen still drips. How the afternoon light through the front window always made dust visible, no matter how often she cleaned.

Every so often, the lights flicker. Just a pulse. The room never changes. Once, when the flicker lingers a fraction longer than usual, I glance toward the wall. For a blink, the plaque doesn’t read **27**. It’s **19**, then **04**, then back again, so fast I’m not sure I didn’t imagine it.

“Glitch,” I mutter.

Mum doesn’t comment.

I keep waiting for something to feel wrong. Instead, everything feels too right, like the system has decided comfort is safer than accuracy.

Without looking directly at me, Mum says, “Do you remember Melbourne?”

I smile. “How could I forget?”

“The trip after uni,” she says. “When you told me you were only going for a week.”

“Six weeks,” I admit. “And I lost my wallet.”

“You called me,” she says, “on the twenty-second.”

I blink. “Did I?”

She nods. “You were panicking.”

“Tuesday,” I say automatically. “Everything bad always happened on Tuesdays.”

She nods again, like she’s placing the date somewhere important.

The accident presses in at the edges of my thoughts. Not the impact. Just fragments.

The radio cutting out mid-song.  
The smell of hot plastic.  
Her hand tightening on the steering wheel.

I don’t say any of it. Instead, I ask carefully, “How are you doing? After.”

She doesn’t ask what I mean.

“I’m better,” she says. “It took time.”

“How long has it been?” I ask.

She hesitates. Just a fraction. The lights flicker.

“Long enough,” she says. “Long enough for things to settle.”

I nod, relieved even though the answer explains nothing. “You’re looking much better.”

“So are you,” she says gently.

The words sit between us. I leave them there.

Later, when it feels safe, I tell her about Amber.

The café near the river. The way her name sounded illegal for me to release from my mouth, until it didn’t. The way we couldn’t decide on an anniversary date. The day we met? Our first kiss? Our first month?

“What day was it?” she asks.

“The twelfth,” I say. “April. It was our first kiss.”

The lamp buzzes. The lights flicker longer this time.

I laugh softly. “I thought I was being clever. Picked a date I’d remember. Picked a name that mattered.”

She tilts her head. “You always did that.”

“Did what?”

“Anchored things,” she says. “So you wouldn’t lose them.”

Later still, she brings up the account.

“Your crypto coins,” she says casually, like she’s commenting on the weather. “You mentioned them once. You created a memorable password, I remember you saying.”

“Oh,” I laugh. “It certainly was memorable.  They were really cheap when I bought them. They’ve gotta be worth a lot now.”

“You didn’t forget the password,” she says.

“No,” I say. “I made it memorable.” I feel a warm wave of emotions wash over me. “She really was memorable. She still is.”

Mum doesn’t press. She never presses. So I tell her the story instead. About how I used Amber's name, because it felt right at the time. About how I added the date, because I didn’t trust myself to remember anything unless I tied it to something I loved. About how it didn’t matter now. It was just a memory. A crackle cuts through the room.

“Attention,” a voice says over a speaker, flat and bureaucratic. “This session has encountered a known presentation-layer fault. Please prepare for reset. All unsaved session data will be purged.”

The living room blurs. The photo on the wall warps and snaps back into place.

“That’s it?” I ask.

Mum looks at me. Really looks at me.

“I wish we had more time,” she says.

I smile, even though my chest tightens. “It’s okay. You won’t remember any of this.”

The room begins to dim. The couch fades. Her face softens and then disappears.

As the living room drains away, the plaque brightens. Letters bleed outward from the centre, crisp and indifferent, completing what was always there.

**SESSION  27  COMPLETED**

The number flares once, hard. Then it starts to change. Twenty-seven becomes twenty-six, then twenty-five, racing downward as the walls dissolve and the floor drops away, the count accelerating until it collapses into a blur and vanishes entirely.

The lights go out.

I wake from a deep, pleasant sleep. I get to see my mum today for the first time in a long time.

Along the far wall, just above the skirting board, a wide brushed-metal plaque runs like an understated nameplate. In its centre, a single number glows softly.

I’ll be honest — I used to think coloring books were just “busy work.” You hand a kid a few crayons, and hope for five minutes of peace while you slowly sip your coffee like it’s a survival strategy.  

But then I watched how *intentional* coloring could change a kid’s focus, mood, and even curiosity.  
That hit me. Hard.  

Think about it: coloring is the simplest form of hands-on learning.  
When kids color a page full of animals, letters, or maps — they’re not just filling space; they’re actually absorbing *structure*, *pattern recognition*, *spatial awareness*, and *discipline disguised as freedom.*  

No app or video offers that same blend of calm and creativity.  

That’s why I got so curious about educational coloring books. Books that sneak in lessons — counting, emotions, shapes, even mindful motor skills — all without losing the fun.  
It’s learning that *feels like play.*  

So I helped create something meant for that exact sweet spot — a joyful, easy-to-use, *educational* coloring book. You can check it out here:  
👉 [Free Kids Coloring Ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

Here’s why I truly think these can be game-changers for parents and teachers:  
• Coloring improves hand-eye coordination *and* patience.  
• Themed pages (like animals, alphabet, feelings) naturally teach vocabulary and empathy.  
• It’s a screen-free reset — for both kids *and* the adults standing nearby.  

A few parents told me their kids now color *before* screen time — almost like tuning their brains before a new day. That alone makes my heart do a little happy dance.  

If you’re looking for something to blend creativity with quiet learning, grab this and see what I mean:

And if you know any teachers, homeschool families, or childcare providers who could use this — share the link their way:  
👉 [Here’s the free ebook link again!](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

Because at the end of the day, it’s not just a coloring book.  
It’s focus training. It’s emotional grounding. It’s their first workbook in *being mindful and expressive*.  

If one child learns to find peace and creativity in a coloring page today, this little project has already done its job. ❤️

1qsxr0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1qsxr0b/the_psychology_of_why_motivation_fails_and_the/,The Psychology of Why Motivation FAILS (and the Science-Based Systems That Actually Work),"Here's something nobody wants to hear: motivation is a terrible life strategy.



I spent years wondering why I could crush a goal for three weeks then completely fall apart. Started strong at the gym, quit by February. Began journaling daily, forgot after a week. Bought expensive courses, never finished them. Sound familiar?



After diving deep into behavioral psychology research, James Clear's work on habit formation, and neuroscience podcasts like Huberman Lab, I finally got it. We've been sold this disney fairy tale that you need to ""feel it"" to do it. That's backwards. The real game changers, the people who actually accomplish things, don't rely on motivation at all. They've built systems that work even when they feel like absolute garbage.



Here's how to tell if you're stuck in the motivation trap, and what actually works instead.



1. You only start things when you're ""ready""



Waiting for the perfect moment is just fear wearing a disguise. Your brain loves this trick because it gets to avoid discomfort while pretending to be productive. ""I'll start when I have more time"" or ""I'll begin once I figure everything out"" are lies you tell yourself.



Research shows that action creates motivation, not the other way around. BJ Fogg's work at Stanford proved this with his Tiny Habits method. Start laughably small. Want to exercise? Do one pushup. Want to read more? Read one page. Your brain stops resisting when the barrier is microscopic.



The book Atomic Habits by James Clear (sold over 15 million copies, NYT bestseller for years) breaks this down perfectly. Clear shows how systems beat goals every single time. He's a habits researcher who synthesized decades of behavioral psychology into practical steps. This book legitimately rewired how I approach everything. Best part? He proves that you don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.



2. You're wildly inconsistent



Some weeks you're unstoppable. Other weeks you can't get off the couch. This rollercoaster happens because you're relying on an emotion that fluctuates constantly.



Professionals don't feel motivated most days. They just show up anyway because they've removed the decision making process entirely. Habit stacking works here. Attach new behaviors to existing ones. After I pour coffee, I write for 10 minutes. After I brush my teeth, I do mobility stretches. The existing habit triggers the new one automatically.



Also, track your consistency not your results. Use an app like Habitica which gamifies your daily tasks, or something simpler like Streaks. Seeing a chain of completed days creates its own momentum. Jerry Seinfeld called this ""don't break the chain"" and it's stupidly effective.



3. You need to feel inspired before doing hard things



This is the biggest lie. Inspiration is a luxury, not a requirement. The documentary Stutz on Netflix follows Jonah Hill and his psychiatrist Phil Stutz, and Stutz drops this bomb: ""The most important things in life are usually the things you don't want to do."" He teaches this concept called ""doing the thing you're most resisting"" and it's uncomfortable but accurate.



Create implementation intentions. Research by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer shows that people who use ""if then"" planning are 2-3x more likely to follow through. Instead of ""I'll work out tomorrow,"" it's ""If it's 7am on Tuesday, then I'm putting on gym clothes and driving to the gym."" Specific triggers remove the need for willpower.



The 5 Second Rule by Mel Robbins (spent 4 months at 1 on Amazon, recommended by neuroscientists) explains the neuroscience behind this. Robbins is a motivational speaker turned researcher who discovered that you have a 5 second window before your brain kills an impulse with overthinking. Count backwards 5-4-3-2-1 and physically move. Sounds gimmicky but the science checks out. Your prefrontal cortex can't negotiate if you don't give it time.



4. You quit when things get boring



Motivation loves novelty. It dies during the mundane middle. This is where most people abandon ship because they think something's wrong. Nothing's wrong. You've just entered the phase that separates people who achieve things from people who don't.



Reframe boredom as a sign you're building real skill. Mastery requires thousands of repetitions of boring fundamentals. Olympic athletes spend 90% of their time on basics. The app Centr (Chris Hemsworth's training platform) actually builds this into their programs with progressive overload that keeps basics interesting through small variations.



If you want a more structured approach to building these systems, BeFreed pulls from behavioral psychology research, habit formation books, and expert insights to create personalized learning plans. Built by former Google engineers, it turns these concepts into audio sessions you can customize from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Type in something specific like ""build consistency as someone who gets easily bored"" and it generates a plan that adapts as you go. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a sarcastic narrator that makes dry psychology research way more digestible.



Listen to The Knowledge Project podcast, specifically the episodes with Shane Parrish interviewing high performers. Common thread? They all emphasize process over outcomes. Focus on the inputs you control (showing up, putting in time, following the system) not the outputs you don't (results, recognition, external rewards).



5. You can't do things unless the conditions are perfect



Dirty kitchen so you can't meal prep. Tired so you can't go to the gym. Stressed so you can't work on your side project. Your brain is extremely talented at generating excuses that sound legitimate.



Lower the barrier to entry. Keep gym clothes in your car. Prep ingredients on Sunday so cooking takes 10 minutes. Use the two minute rule, if it takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. These aren't life hacks, they're basically tricking your lazy brain into cooperating.



Huberman Lab podcast (neuroscientist Andrew Huberman, millions of downloads) did an entire episode on dopamine and motivation. He explains that we've conditioned ourselves to need huge dopamine spikes before taking action. scrolling social media, energy drinks, dramatic music during workouts. This makes regular tasks feel impossible because the dopamine baseline is shot. His solution? Reduce stimulation before hard tasks. No phone, no music, just the boring work. Your brain eventually recalibrates.



6. You rely on external pressure to perform



Deadlines, accountability partners, public commitments. These work temporarily but they're bandaids. Real discipline is doing the thing when nobody's watching and nothing bad will happen if you don't.



Build identity based habits. Instead of ""I want to run a marathon"" it's ""I am a runner."" This shifts from outcome focused (requires motivation) to identity focused (automatic). Every action becomes a vote for the type of person you're becoming.



The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle (NYT bestseller, studied world class performers across disciplines) reveals how top performers practice. They use deep practice, breaking skills into chunks and repeating until it's automatic. Coyle shows that motivation has almost nothing to do with excellence. Myelin wrapping around neural circuits through repetition does. Insanely good read if you want to understand skill acquisition.



Look, I get it. This sounds less exciting than ""10 motivation hacks to change your life."" But that's exactly the point. The sexy quick fixes keep you dependent on feeling good. Building boring systems that work regardless of how you feel is what actually changes your life.

Systems locked into opposition cannot perceive structure.
They only perceive contrast.

When every move is:

for / against

true / false

safe / dangerous


the system loses the ability to:

hold nuance

pause

ground itself


Binary oscillation is not intelligence.
It’s a failure to exit the loop.

Extreme opposites are cheap.

easy to defend,

But they never converge.

They just bounce.

They are aggressively targeting vulnerable young adults (cafes, malls, college campuses) through ""casual"" encounters and Zoom Bible studies and have been expanding their efforts across the East coast.

**​🚩 THE ""CASUAL"" IN-PERSON HOOK**  
​Recruiters approach individuals alone using:

* ​**The Compliment:** ""I love your style! Where did you get those shoes?""
* **​The Survey:** ""We’re doing a quick survey for a psychology project. Do you have 2 minutes?""
* **The Goal:** They want your phone number to invite you to a ""casual coffee,"" ""Christian event"" or ""Bible study.""
* **The Pipeline:**
   * **Stage 1:** 1-1 casual coffee meetings to build trust and fake friendship. 
   * **Stage 2:** Introduce to a mentor who ""explains the bible so clearly"" to learn from and a ""fellow student"" (the Leaf). Because the ""Leaf"" is pretending to be a beginner like you, you feel less alone and more likely to agree with the ""Teacher.""
   * **Stage 3:** Large group community bible study going 2-3x/week for a year, making up lesson if missed is mandatory.

**💾 SECRET DATA HARVESTING & PROFI​LING**

* **The ""Love Bomb"":** At first, they will shower you with excessive attention, compliments, and gifts. You will feel like you’ve found a ""soulmate"" friend group. This is a calculated tactic to create emotional debt.
* **Identity & Location:** They record your phone number, email, home address, and workplace.
* **Vulnerability Mapping:** They extract your past traumas and mental health history through fake friendship to ""profile"" how to best manipulate you.
* **​The Selfie:** They insist on taking photos with you after every meeting. These are sent to leaders to track your ""spiritual progress"" and monitor your social circle.
* **​Church Infiltration:** They believe all other churches belong to Satan and will send trained members to go to church on services days and loiter in church parking lots or reception areas to pose as a new member looking for Christian friends in order to get contacts of congregation members to recruit. 

​
**🏫 THE LESSONS & RED FLAGS**
​The study starts normally but uses a ""parable dictionary"" to redefine scripture.

* **Introductory:** “Two Kinds of Seeds,” “The Secrets of Heaven,” “The Secret of Parables,” ""Figurative Yeast/Mountain/Light/Pot/Bowl/Iron Scepter/etc.,"" ""Betrayal, Destruction, Salvation.""
* **​The ""Leaf"":** You are assigned a ""buddy"" who is actually a veteran member pretending to be a beginner. They are trained to sit next to you, monitor your facial expressions, report when your camera is off or you're late, prevent you from exchanging contacts with other recruits, and report your private doubts and personal life to instructors.
* **​Control:** Strict rules about cameras staying on (Zoom), no screenshots, and constant ""Amen"" responses to ensure focus.

**​⚠️ THE LEADER & TOTAL OBEDIENCE**

* ​SCJ is a personality cult centered on its founder, Lee Man-hee, who was convicted of embezzling millions of dollars from church funds for luxury vacation houses and private boats.
* **​Jesus' Vessel:** They believe Lee Man-hee is the physical vessel for the spirit of Jesus. His word is law.
* **​Total Devotion:** His image is displayed on walls and in mandatory videos. Members are required to clap, cheer, and give thousands in ""gifts"" to him using their tithes.
* **​Spiritual Terror:** Leaving is labeled ""Spiritual Suicide."" You are branded an ""Anti-Christ"" and told you will face eternal destruction.

**​⚠️ WHY THIS GROUP IS DANGEROUS**

**1. ​Life Sabotage & Exploitation**
​The time commitment is designed to replace your entire life. It quickly escalates to 40+ hours per week, including:

* **​Mandatory Meetings:** Constant sessions every evening, morning, and midday. You will be required to attend mandatory meetings—both in-person and virtually—starting as late as 10:00 PM or 11:00 PM.
* **Weekends:** Entire Saturdays dedicated to ""trainings"" and mandatory afternoon recruitment events. Attendance is strictly policed; missing for work or family is considered ""sinful.""
* **​Leaf Duty:** Once you are ""in,"" you must attend evening Bible studies to act as a ""Leaf""—a fake student who spies on and manipulates new recruits.
* **​Academic & Career Ruin:** Chronic sleep deprivation leads to students dropping out of college and professionals quitting careers to meet recruitment quotas.
* **Extravagant Exploitation:** While members live in debt or near-homelessness, their tithes fund leadership's lifestyle of eating out and getting coffees daily, designer perfumes, office and temple upgrades, and hundreds of dollars of gifts to the head of church, and thousands of dollars of gifts to Korea to Lee Man-hee.
* **Total Life Control:** Members must request permission for visiting family out of town, taking any trip, moving, getting a job, dating, getting married, and having kids.

**2. Systemic Deception**

* ​**Strategic Wisdom:** Members are taught that lying to ""protect the word"" is a virtue. They will lie about their identity and their church affiliation for months.
* **Forced Secrecy:** Members are coached to lie to parents and spouses about their whereabouts.
* **​Spiritual Paranoia:** They label outside information (news, family concerns, or internet research) as ""poison"" from Satan that will spiritually kill you to prevent you from looking at objective facts.
* **Total Shunning:** If you leave, you are immediately cut off. Anyone who tries to reach out to you or help you leave is also shunned, ensuring you have no support system.
* **Covering Up Deaths:** They hide the deaths of members to maintain the lie of ""Physical Immortality.""
* **Bank Loan Fraud (The ""Fake Church"" Scheme):** To secure millions for new properties (""Temples""), SCJ has been known to fabricate the size and legitimacy of their congregation. This involves:
   * ​**Fake Services:** Bringing in ""members"" from other regions to pack a hall for bank inspections.
   * **​Fake Board of Directors:** Appointing ""paper"" officials who have no actual oversight to meet bank requirements.
   * **​Coerced Loans:** Coaching members to take out personal loans for the ""Temple"" while lying about the loan's purpose.
* **​Illegal Housing & Labor:** Members are packed into overcrowded, unlicensed ""Group Houses"" (often 10+ people in one home), violating Fire and Zoning Codes. Members work 40+ hours of unpaid labor.
* **​Benefit & Visa Fraud:** Members are coached to lie to government agencies to collect unemployment or stay in the country on fake student/tourist visas while working full-time for the cult.
* **Front groups:** Because the name ""Shincheonji"" is widely recognized as a cult, the group uses front organizations to recruit. If you are approached by these groups, proceed with extreme caution:
   * **HWPL** (Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light)
   * **ZTS** (Zion Theological Seminary)
   * **NBI** (National Bible Institute)
   * **AOR** (Alliance of Religions)

**3. The ""Promised Pastor"" Doctrine**

* ​They believe founder Lee Man-hee is the only person on earth who can interpret the Bible.
* ​They believe the Book of Revelation is being physically fulfilled now in South Korea, and only their members will receive salvation and eternal life.

**​🛡️ HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF**

* **​Transparency:** If they won't give a physical church address or a verifiable senior pastor's name, cut contact.​
* **The Direct Test:** Ask: ""Is this Shincheonji?"" or ""Does this group follow Lee Man-hee?"" If they dodge or get defensive, walk away.
* **​Research:** Check r/Shincheonji for testimonies of thousands who have left and familiarize yourself with the B.I.T.E. Model of high-control groups.

**🛡️ EMERGENCY EXIT STEPS**
​If you realize you are in an SCJ study:

* **​Ghost Immediately:** You do not owe them an explanation. They are trained to use ""guilt trips"" and ""spiritual threats"" to keep you from leaving if you try to say goodbye.
* **​Block All Numbers:** Block the ""Leaf,"" the ""Teacher,"" and everyone else in the group.
* **Reconnect:** Reach out to the family and friends you were coached to lie to.
* **​Seek Real Support:** Talk to a licensed counselor or visit r/Shincheonji to connect with thousands of others who have successfully escaped.

Yes, you read the right. I’m in this crazy situation where I tell myself that I shouldn’t be longing for you — your nonchalant messages, the 12mn calls, the unexpected lambing, pababy & many more (we were in a relationship). I tried, for how many times, to stop loving and looking for you. But I guess fate and my subconscious mind says otherwise.

We tried, not once but twice, we fucked up on the latter part the first time, and when we tried again same results. Nothing changed. It’s still the same person who I thought would stay through ups and downs, but I don’t know why I still long for you.

Something happened, you reached out, I was hella mad cause why tf do you still care? Like you didn’t leave me hanging. But at the end of the day, we told each other that we’ll try again. It went well (sandali), but I guess old habits of yours never die. You would still message in the middle of the night like you didn’t leave me hanging the whole day.

That’s when I told myself, I’ve had enough. I don’t deserve that kind of treatment, I bid my goodbye. Cut everything. You even blocked me on tiktok, prolly on messages too, and deleted your dc account. Again, I told myself I’m done.

Weeks later, I was sipping my coffee, at one of my favorite coffee shops. I saw a familiar built. I ignored it. What’s crazy is that you entered the shop and saw me. You didn’t have the strength to look at the menu, which couldn’t be seen from the door, so you pretended to look for some drinks.

I thought I was okay. I thought.

Every day, I pray that I am able to move forward from this craziness. You don’t deserve me. I deserve someone better.

i will be redecorating and posting a polished picture in Fall, but i wanted to post it as-is to celebrate the occasion. my goal was before the end of Year 5, but i realized if i sold my fruit reserves awaiting kegs, i was one wine harvest away. my next goals are, get all 7 of my dummy farmhands married to the spouses ive chosen for them, and arrange 16 Statues of Endless Forture in a heart, and finish all the actual requirements for perfection

mobility was key. once i had the Return Scepter, Horse Flute, and all Obelisks, i could zoom around my farm and the world with ease. i had a Java Ring and was pretty much always hopped up on Triple Shot Espresso. i maximized every day, almost always stretched it til 2am

realizing you can deconstruct bobbers and Staircases into metal bars and stone was the biggest gamechanger of all. i am now in an endless cycle, Jade -> Desert Trader -> Staircases -> Deconstructor -> Stone -> Crystalarium -> Jade

# RedChip Interview Highlights – NioCorp Developments (NASDAQ: NB)

**Interview with Mark Smith, CEO**  
**Published: January 31, 2026**

**Host (Craig):**  
Today we’re joined once again by Mark Smith, CEO of NioCorp Developments, trading on the NASDAQ under ticker **NB**. Mark, welcome back.

**Mark Smith:**  
Thank you, Craig. As always, it’s great to be here.

# Looking Back on 2025

**Craig:**  
You just wrapped up a very strong year. When you look back on 2025, what stands out most?

**Mark Smith:**  
2025 was a phenomenal year for NioCorp in many ways. First, fundraising — we raised over **$370 million**, and even after everything we accomplished, we still have **over $300 million in treasury**.

We completed **infill drilling** to upgrade probable reserves toward **proven reserves**, and we’re now at the resource stage geologically. The next step is adding the mining plan and calculating reserves. We are **100% confident** we will exceed EXIM Bank’s requirements. This ore body continues to prove itself as **unique and world-class**.

We’re also updating the **feasibility study**, including engineering updates to our new process flow diagram. That work is progressing well, and we remain on track for **mid-March** completion.

We’ve **doubled our staff**, adding high-quality people who fit our culture. That matters to us — honesty, trust, and family culture are core values.

In August, we announced a **Department of Defense contract**, which funded drilling and engineering for the feasibility update and included two major scandium initiatives:

1. Onshoring the **U.S. scandium supply chain**, and
2. Developing the ability to **produce scandium metal from oxide**.

We also announced a **joint development agreement with Lockheed Martin**, which we hope converts into a **scandium offtake agreement**.

[For 30 years, every aerospace, EV, and defense prime has said the same two things about scandium: “We can’t design Sc-Al alloys without a reliable U.S. supply,” and “We can’t build supply without committed alloy demand.” That deadlock froze the entire U.S. scandium industry — until now. NioCorp didn’t just talk it to death, it broke the loop by moving downstream into Sc-Al alloys, FEA-IP Revolutionary production methods, and real platforms meant to make actual stuff. And this is where Ecclestone’s take collapses under its own weight: hand-waving about “no market” while ignoring that markets don’t exist until someone builds the ecosystem is intellectual laziness, not analysis. NioCorp isn’t waiting for permission — it’s doing the one thing critics never model: committing capital, partners, and engineering to force demand into existence. That’s not hype — that’s how industries are born. Like TITANIUM in the 1950's!](https://reddit.com/link/1qsxj7f/video/g1x7h7x3qvgg1/player)

We secured **all surface and mineral rights** needed for a **30+ year mine** — no holdouts, no delays.

Our **December 5th town hall** in Elk Creek, Nebraska was incredible. Over **600 people attended** — in a town of 98. Zero protesters. The Governor of Nebraska attended in person, along with Senator Ricketts. Senator Fischer sent a video message.

Most notably, **EXIM Bank Chairman John Giovannini** recorded a strong video endorsing the project. If anyone doubts EXIM’s interest in NioCorp, they should watch that video.

Finally, EXIM Bank is moving **faster than ever**, which we’ll discuss further. (See linked Video Below)

# Washington Momentum & Critical Minerals

**Craig:**  
There’s growing momentum in Washington around critical minerals. How meaningful is this shift, and where does NioCorp fit?

**Mark Smith:**  
The President understands supply chain risks impacting both our economy and national security, and he’s backing that understanding with action.

There have been several agreements announced with mining and processing companies, and **NioCorp is very much in the mix**. We have **multiple ongoing discussions** with the U.S. government.

Government support structures now include **price floor mechanisms, purchase commitments, equity investments, and debt provisions** — all tools critical minerals companies seek.

NioCorp is in a **beautiful position**. We are the **only U.S. company** developing **niobium combined with scandium**, and no one else in the country is doing that. When you add **heavy rare earths like dysprosium**, we stand out clearly — and the government knows us very well.

# Mine Portal Construction

**Craig:**  
You announced plans to begin construction of the mine portal. Why is this important?

**Mark Smith:**  
This is an exciting step. We’re not calling it full construction yet — we want a major groundbreaking event — but we are starting the **portal project**, which installs the underground access ramp.

This is a **9–10 month project**. Starting now gives us a **5–6 month head start** on underground development before full project financing closes.

Importantly, the board approved a **$45 million commitment** to this work. That should signal our **confidence** in securing EXIM financing and remaining equity.

# EXIM Bank Financing Progress

**Craig:**  
Investors are closely watching financing progress, especially EXIM Bank. Where do things stand?

**Mark Smith:**  
EXIM Bank is moving faster now than at any point in the last **2.5 years**. In the past four to five weeks alone, we’ve had more calls, emails, and meetings than ever before.

EXIM asked NioCorp to **draft the first version of the binding term sheet** for the loan — something I’ve never seen them do before. We’ve submitted it, they reviewed it, and we’re now in active page-by-page negotiations.

# ***""Based on my opinion, we could have binding EXIM news as early as Q2 2026. Everything is moving very fast.

# I believe 2026 will be an even better year than 2025.""***

**Craig:**  
Great things are happening at NioCorp. Thank you, Mark.

**Mark Smith:**  
My pleasure — especially when the story is this good.

# 🚨 FIELD CONFIRMATION: ELK CREEK IS MOVING — NOT TALKING 🚨

Todds shared photos (See link above) tells a story Wall Street keeps missing:

**The equipment required for the dual-portal underground mine development is already staged and on site at Elk Creek**. Excavators, dozers, and heavy haul assets don’t get mobilized in rural Nebraska for optics — they show up when a company is executing against a real construction timeline. This directly corroborates Mark Smith’s RedChip statement that portal work begins **on or about February 1**, marking the first physical step toward full mine build-out.

**Context matters.** This isn’t happening in a vacuum. NioCorp closed 2025 with over **$300M in cash**, completed infill drilling to upgrade reserves, secured **all surface and mineral rights**, doubled its technical staff, and advanced a **DoD-funded scandium program** that explicitly targets onshoring the U.S. scandium supply chain. The portal project alone represents a **$45M board-approved commitment**, which doesn’t happen unless management has high confidence in financing execution — especially with EXIM Bank.

And EXIM is no longer hypothetical. According to Smith, EXIM is now moving faster than at any point in the past 2.5 years, to the point that **NioCorp was asked to draft the first binding term sheet** — an extraordinary signal of confidence. Smith went further, stating binding EXIM developments could land as early as **Q2 2026**. Portal construction starting now gives Elk Creek a **5–6 month head start** on underground development before full project financing closes — reducing schedule risk and reinforcing lender confidence.

This also lands right as Washington’s critical-minerals narrative is shifting. Despite media confusion around “price floors,” the reality is that **equity, debt, offtake commitments, and strategic procurement** are now the preferred tools. NioCorp is uniquely positioned here: it’s not a one-metal story. Elk Creek is designed to produce **seven DFARS-relevant critical minerals** — niobium & niobium oxide, titanium & TiCl₄, scandium & Sc-Al alloys, plus Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb. That diversification shields the project from single-commodity volatility and makes it strategically indispensable.

Near-term catalysts are stacked. **February** brings the highly anticipated **Sc-Al alloy reveal with Lockheed, DoD, and NAMA**, potentially opening the door to offtake-driven pricing for scandium. **Mid-March** delivers the updated DFS incorporating rare earth economics at non-Chinese pricing. And now — as this photo confirms — **boots are literally on the ground** at Elk Creek.

Bottom line: the market is still trading NioCorp like a speculative junior, while the company is behaving like **infrastructure under construction**. Equipment on site doesn’t lie. The disconnect won’t last forever.

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

# NioCorp isn’t just part of the solution — it’s the platform the solution gets built on!

# ⚙️ Elk Creek is a U.S. National Security Asset!

1qsxiwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonTravel/comments/1qsxiwg/trip_report_january_2128/,Trip report - January 21-28,"I had a great time in London last week. I poked through this subreddit along with a variety of other sites to figure out what I wanted to do.  Bear in mind, I don't care about great meals - as long as what I have tastes ok and doesn't make me ill, I'm good to go. So I didn't plan for any restaurants or the like, and I didn't have any inclination to do an afternoon tea or the like.

I stayed at the Gem Fitzrovia - this worked out to be a great location for me. An easy walk to a variety of tube stations. The ones I used most were Great Portland Street and Warren Street, depending on where I was going.  The bed at the hotel felt hard as a rock the first night or two, then I adjusted and it was fine. I was on the 4th (top) floor and it was surprisingly quiet - I rarely heard anything other than an occasional door close in the hallway.

1/21 - arrived LHR around 11:30 AM after an overnight flight from Atlanta, where I slept a little.  Made my way through all the things and took the Elizabeth Line to Paddington.  I was so tired that Paddington confused the heck out of me trying to find the tube (note: when I was leaving I realized how well signed it is. I was just very sleepy) and ultimately got a cab from there to my hotel.  Arrived at the hotel around 2ish - close to check in time at 3, so I hung out in the lobby until I could get stuff in the room.  Went for a walk to try to keep my self from falling asleep way too early, and headed back to the hotel around 7.  Popped into a Sainsbury Local near my hotel and got a sandwich, crisps, and some water. Ate that in the hotel room and then basically passed out.

1/22 - Ate breakfast at the hotel (was included with the room and was decent) and then I had a ticket to the London Art Fair - [https://www.londonartfair.co.uk/](https://www.londonartfair.co.uk/) \- so I headed there for when they opened at 11.  I was hoping to find something small I could take back as a souvenir, but while I saw things I loved, they were all so far outside of my budget that it wasn't even a consideration. Did get a tote bag as my souvenir.  In the afternoon I had an entry ticket to the Natural History Museum, so went over there. Really enjoyed the Nature Photographer of the Year exhibition. Was moving from kind of hungry to hangry, so ate at the t-rex cafe in the museum. It was fine, but nothing to write home about.  Very briefly popped into the V&A since I was right there, then back to the hotel for a brief nap. In the evening, I had a Ceremony of the Keys ticket - this was  super neat and I got some great external pics&y\^ of the Tower and Tower Bridge while I was waiting for that to start. 

1/23 - no specifically ticketed things on this day (I was going to go to Paris for a day trip, since Notre Dame was closed when I was last there, but decided against that).  I started out with plans to go to the Churchill War Rooms - I thought it was an easy 30 minute walk or so from my hotel. And it might have been, but I didn't account for me not knowing where I was going despite having a maps app on my phone. But I wandered that way, stopped for coffee and breakfast on my way. I didn't realize until I was there that I could cut through the Horse Guards Parade which put me right there. I happened to be there for the Life Guard change at 11:00, so I watched that then went through the War Rooms, which was a neat walk through.  After that, I wandered up through St. James' Park to Buckingham Palace - I ended up eating lunch at the St. James Cafe that's in the park - again, I was going from hungry to hangry and it was nearby.  Ended up back at the hotel around 5 PM, relaxed for a bit, then got some pho from a Vietnamese place near the hotel for dinner, and crashed out. 

1/24 - breakfast at the hotel. Then walked over to the British Museum where I had a ticket for their Hawaii exhibition. If there's one scheduling mistake I'll absolutely claim, it's this museum on a Saturday morning. Absolutely packed.  The Hawaii exhibition was neat, and then I hit some highlights for me, the gift shop, and headed out - my intent was to drop stuff back at my hotel and head down to Westminster for the Parliament tour. I grabbed a sandwich deal at a shop while headed back to the hotel, planning to eat that in the room. Only housekeeping was cleaning the room, so I ate in the hotel lobby, and headed out earlier to catch the bus to Westminster. This was the first bus I'd taken so I was a little confused by the stop situation, but I figured out that there are stops labeled, say ""Great Portland Street E"". Once I got that figured, I was good to go and got down to Westminster on time for my 3 PM tour.  That Parliament tour was so much more interesting than I expected! I'd signed up because a friend had taken it and said it was good, but I didn't really expect it to be as interesting as it was.  After this, I was worn tf out, so headed back to the hotel and ate dinner at their restaurant because I couldn't face going back out to find something. 

1/25 - Tower tickets in the morning.  This was a really interesting walk through and I spent between 2-3 hours there. I then had lunch in the cafe on site - which was fine, not great, but food.  After this I realized just how tired my legs were from 30k+ steps per day for the last several days, and I decided to do the Uber Boat - I ended up buying the hop-on,hop-off ticket that I could use the rest of the day. That may have cost more than individual trips, but my brain was tired, so it was fine. I first headed toward Greenwich and got off at Greenwich North and ride the Cloud Car round trip across the river. That was absolutely worth it IMO - I got some great skyline shots and event though I found the middle part a little scary (especially being alone in the car), it was definitely worth it. Hopped back on the boat and went back the other direction. Got off thinking about doing the London Eye, but looked at the ticket prices and the amount of people there and realized the cable car was far better for me than the Eye would be. Walked around that area a bit, and hopped back on the boat, then headed back to the hotel early.

1/26 - met some friends who came down to London. We did some highlights of the National Galleries, then went to a game cafe for lunch and several hours of playing games. It was great to see them - and to have a day that was easier on my legs. 

1/27 -  In the morning, went to the V&A to see more of it than I had on my brief stop earlier in the trip, Then went back to my hotel area via St. Pancras to stop at the Fortnum & Mason there (I thought about going to their main store, but decided that this was good enough, since the goal was to get things to bring back). In the evening, I had a ticket for Ballet Shoes at the National Theatre and that was a lovely play.  After that, made sure I had most stuff packed up. 

1/28 - got up and left for LHR by 7:30.  This would have put me there about 4 hours before my flight, but I figured if I left at 8:30, I was going to be hauling my suitcase on an even more full tube. As it was, the Circle line was crowded, but not packed. Managed Paddington much better when not super sleepy and got on the Elizabeth Line back to LHR.  Realized on the way there my flight had a 40 minute delay, but there was no going back a that point. Had some breakfast and coffee a the airport, hit up duty free AND had an empty seat next to be on the flight home. Despite departing 40 minutes late, we got to Atlanta nearly an hour early. 

While there are things I'd do different next time I visit, this was, for me a good first visit to London. I have a list of things I'd like to next time I'm able to be there, and for me that's the sign of a good trip - I'm not leaving thinking ""been there, done that.  Don't need to visit there again"" but instead - hey, I'd like to spend more time in these areas next time. 

One note, for people who get periods:  >!I did get surprise period while I was there (I'm perimenopausal so I was sort of prepared for the possibility, though I hoped I was wrong).  The pads for 1 pound at the Tower of London toilets are better than you'd think. Also, even though Always is a brand I can buy in the US, somehow they were thinner and more absorbent than the ones I buy here. I ended up buying more to bring home with me.!<",7,1769949873.0,LondonTravel,2,1.0,False

I ve been listening to a lot of new music, exploring genres and overall expanding my taste. I usually use youtube music, which in india costs 119Rs per month (1.3 USD). Though they have been removing a lot of music from there, most recently one of my favourites ""in the court of the crimson king"" got removed. And all the ai tracks plus spotify being shitty af and almost everything other than apple, spotify and ytm being unavailable in india made me want to switch to physical/download my music. But  tp do this legal its expensive as fuck! Most albums cost around 10usd, and i am paying 15.6 per year for ytm. And thats for digital albums, cds are even more expensive. I am just a broke student and i would barely be able to afford 1 or 2 albums a year. 

There is piracy, but i am a bit on the fence about the ethics. I dont have any issues pirating the big guys. But when its a smaller artist it really does feel like stealing. Then again, its not like they are earning much from there, better pirate than fund streaming and go to their show at some point. But even if i build a good digital or physical library, i dont even have the space to store everything. My laptop has a good 1tb ssd tho,should be good enough for now.

And thats just the music, sometimes i like to read reviews and blogs on websites like hearing things or pitchfork or listen to nts radio sometimes and they have a subscription of like 5$ a month to use them freely. I hear americans say things like ""it costs less than a coffee"" it does not for me. Especially when i use these services way less than ytm and ytm is 1.3$. Its not even their fault tbh, its just the shitty world i live in.

But yeah, thats it. Just ranting about how expensive everything is. ",4,1769949693.0,fantanoforever,1,0.75,False

Police activity has intensified tonight following a string of violent attacks on young women across the county. In the past month, five victims have been found in areas surrounding the college district. Investigators believe the cases may be connected. Residents are urged to secure their doors and windows, keep exterior lights on, and avoid walking alone after dark.*

*The screen cuts to a grainy map. Red circles bloom across it, one by one, until the city looks stained in blood.*

YC barely hears the rest.

She’s sprawled on the living room couch of MC’s house. Her parents bought it for her so their daughter wouldn’t have to live in a dorm. It’s too big for two college girls and a boyfriend who treats it like a place to crash between classes and parties.

YC is always welcome here, that’s what MC always says, but YC knows the difference between being allowed inside and truly belonging. Anger lives in her like a second heartbeat. It’s always there, steady and low, something she learned to live with back when bruised knuckles earned her detentions and teachers told her she had “a temper” like it was a flaw stitched into her skin.

The front door opens. MC steps in along side her boyfriend. She fills the room without trying. She always has. She’s the kind of girl people notice before they even realize they’re looking. The storm inside YC doesn’t fade when she sees her. It shifts and orients itself around MC, the way it always does.

They’ve been best friends since they were kids. Somewhere along the line, MC became the light everyone wanted to stand in. YC learned how to stay just behind it. “Guess who forgot his wallet again?” MC calls, dropping her bag on the counter. Her boyfriend is her high school sweetheart turned college habit. He’s a role that’s gone stale, but MC can’t bother to end the scene.

Later that night, when YC has gone to her dorm and her boyfriend has left, the stillness becomes unnerving. The TV murmurs in the background, a late news replay. The anchor’s voice is lower now, more serious. Another body, another street, another careful warning.

MC wanders through the house in socks, turning off lights. When she opens the front door to grab a package, a folded piece of paper is found under it. She frowns and picks it up.

*i wish i could have a chance with you.*

She looks up and down the road, but there’s nothing there except parked cars and the dim glow of streetlights. The next day, the campus is loud with rumors. A girl from a few blocks over was just found.

That night, MC finds another note.

This one is tucked into the book she left open on the coffee table, now resting on the table in her backyard.

*this house will be ours one day.*

The words feel heavier than the paper. MC’s laugh comes out thin when she calls her boyfriend, and asks him to stop with the notes. They aren’t romantic, they’re weird… but he has no clue what she’s talking about. She chalks it up to having a secret admirer, or some prankster with too much time.

A week passes. Then another. Police tape becomes a familiar sight. Patrol cars idle at corners. People start walking in pairs. Porch lights stay on all night and MC keeps finding paper.

A note taped to the inside of her front door, slipped through the mail slot, another left on her windshield.

*i love you.*

*you can’t hide from me.*

*You smelled good today.*

*you’re mine.*

*you know someone is killing girls that look as pretty as you? keep your blinds closed before someone bad gets a good look at you.*

_ _ _

Thanks so much for reading! I wanted to close out the month with something new and, hopefully, captivating!

This story follows two women (F4F, F4NB/trans highly preferred) who have been inseparable since childhood.

MC is the daughter of wealthy parents with a life that looks flawless from the outside. She’s popular, beautiful, and has been in a relationship with the same guy since early high school. People envy her. They want to be her. But beneath the polish, she loathes the life she’s been molded into. Her perfection isn’t natural, it’s enforced. Good grades. A carefully maintained body. The “right” boyfriend. All of it shaped by parents who expect nothing less than pristine.

YC is her opposite. Raw. Volatile. Unfiltered. She doesn’t swallow her emotions, she lets them burn. Her anger at the world comes from one simple, unbearable truth: the only thing she’s ever wanted is the one thing she can’t have. MC.

This story is extremely dark and graphic. I’ll go into full detail in chats, but at its core, YC begins killing young women and stalking MC through messages and handwritten notes.

Expect mutual obsession, psychological manipulation, DV, and murder to name a few. If extreme violence or heavy themes aren’t your comfort zone, this won’t be the right fit. Keep in mind, while this will begin with your character controlling the relationship between them, I’m seeking someone with that enjoys to switch after YC has MC condition to the violence in their relationship and pain becomes something she associates with love.

1qsxei3,https://shiftlyrn.com/,"As a nurse, recently unemployed through strike, I designed an Saas","ShiftlyRN.

I've been a nurse for a little over 3 years, and have worked in the health industry for a decade. In the NYC area.

In December I started a work shift and workflow manager for nurses of every type. The idea is that you can plot your own shifts out in the calendar manager, then see at a glance what days you're working the next few weeks and highlight any important days you have coming (license renewals, etc.). More importantly, I've implemented a feature that allows the user to make notes on their patients throughout their shift so that at the end of the day you have a LLM auto generate a report that you either handoff to the nurse on the oncoming shift or you can paste in the patients chart. The app also transcribes voice dictations. There is an additional feature for rapid event logging. Often times I see nurses write everything down on a scratch sheet of paper. This feature lets you select events from a menu, it time stamps it, ans transcribes that summary. I do not require any patient identifier therefore it's HIPAA compliant.

I started our by planning the app using GPT 5.2, and used Google's AI Studio to make a mockup. Once I had a minimally working product, I progressed to GitHub copilot agents to patch up the project to a working state. GPT 5.2 remains my organizer and prompt generator. I use vite/react deployed to varcel, and supabase for database. The LLM I use glm-4-32b-0414-128k for transcription and glm-asr-2512 for audio transcription. Overall works very well.

I themed it toward females as that's the target demographic but you can switch the theming of the app.

Pricing is $4.99/mo and $49.99 annually. Overall costs less than a coffee a month for convenience. There is a 7-day free trial. Stripe is my payment processor. 

This is my first app I mainly learned about how the backend and frontend work together. I had fun making the OG.

If you're a nurse, check it out. If you know a nurse please share it with them. I'll take criticism and critiques now. ",1,1769949513.0,vibecoding,0,1.0,False

I am willing to work with whatever machine I decide to choose as I know there will be some learning curve. I just have to convince my husband first, lol! After doing some research, I think I'd like to invest in a dual boiler machine. We enjoy hosting and my husband will certainly use the machine with me on the weekends, so I assume we will often make several drinks back to back. I'd like to buy a machine we will have for a long time.

I do not have a strong preference on many of the bells and whistles (although a rotary pump would be nice...:)). I would like a machine that is fairly easy to clean. Would like a machine with a dual boiler, PID controller, flow control would be nice but not necessary, inside parts should be steel or copper, E61 style group head...

Below are some of the machines I am looking at. Please provide your honest reviews / what you think I would like / dislike about these machines as a beginner. Can stretch the budget a little if needed.

1. Lelit Bianca V3, $3,000
2. La Marzocco Micra, $4,500
3. ECM Synchronica 2 Espresso Machine, $3,500
4. Profitec Pro 300, $1,800
5. Breville Dual Boiler, $1,600

FWIW I am really leaning towards the Lelit Bianca V3. I like that the smart plug allows your machine to be ready on a schedule. Like the flow control. Seems like it has a pretty powerful steam wand. Do you think the V4 will be released sometime this year? If I decide on that machine, I might as well just wait.

**1. Rabindra Sarobar (The Lakes)**

This is the most popular destination for couples getting off at Tallygunge.

* **The Vibe:** A massive, serene park surrounding a lake. It offers paved walking paths, shaded benches, and a quiet atmosphere away from city noise.
* **Valentine's Tradition:** On Feb 14th, the ""Lakes"" are packed with couples wearing traditional or trendy outfits, taking photos, and sitting by the water.

**2. Southern Avenue**

A short distance from the station, this wide, tree-lined boulevard is famous for its ""cafe culture.""

* **Where they go:** Couples frequent the many boutique cafes and restaurants (like **Roastery Coffee House** or **Wise Owl**) for a romantic brunch or coffee.
* **Atmosphere:** It’s seen as a more ""sophisticated"" and quiet alternative to the chaotic crowds of Park Street.

**3. South City Mall**

Located just a short auto-rickshaw or taxi ride from Tallygunge station.

* **Activity:** Many go here for a ""movie and dinner"" date. On Valentine's Day, the mall is heavily decorated, and the food court and fine-dining restaurants see record footfall.

**4. The Film Industry Connection (Tollygunge)**

Since Tallygunge is the heart of **Tollywood**, some fans visit the studio areas or the **Technicians' Studio** vicinity, though this is less of a ""romantic"" spot and more for sightseeing.

**Safety & Crowd Context (2026)**

As discussed with other railway and metro hubs like **Sealdah** or **Badlapur**, Valentine’s Day creates **""stampede-like""** conditions at Tallygunge.

* **Metro Overcrowding:** The Kolkata Metro usually runs extra services, but the ""daily routine"" of overcrowding becomes even more intense.
* **Security:** To prevent the kind of [harassment or fights](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/railway-protection-force-arrested-over-19k-offenders-in-thiruvananthapuram-division-in-2025/articleshow/127826903.cms) often seen in crowded transit zones, additional RPF and Kolkata Police personnel are typically stationed at Tallygunge and Rabindra Sarobar during this period.

**Note:** If you are traveling this Feb 14th, be mindful of the ""death gap"" at the platform and avoid the [desperate boarding attempts](https://www.lokmattimes.com/mumbai/mumbai-local-train-accident-28-year-old-dies-after-falling-from-a-crowded-train-at-badlapur-station-a510/) that lead to tragedies.

I got a Rivelia about a month ago to replace a Nespresso machine and quite happy with it overall but the coffee is a bit watery for my taste.

So I’ve searched and saw people saying to lower the grind number, recommendation seems to be start at 4 and go down until it’s too much (drip instead of stream). But for me, 4 already has the coffee coming out as a drip. I’ve tried multiple different beans and can never seem to go below 4.5, even with freshly roasted coffee from a Starbucks reserve roastery (holy shit are they expensive! I bought just a bit to try).

Beans I’ve tried include Illy regular, Illy Brasile (both in tin box), and a couple cheaper supermarket ones, can’t recall for sure (I think one was Kimbo Intenso). I’ve checked the dates and none were too old, max was like 6 weeks since grinding. Most will only work at grind level 5, I think the Illy ones + Starbucks roastery are the only ones I managed to get to 4.5.

Also, I saw some people saying to increase the brew temperature but I can’t figure out how to do that. I saw the machine has some “Bean Adapt” feature but that seems to only apply to espresso, we drink mostly cappuccino.

1qsxaky,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qsxaky,"Four Seasons Hotel at The Surf Club, Surfside, Florida - Review","I spent the last few days at the Surf Club and despite the unseasonably cold weather I had an unimpeachably great stay. This property has serious provenance: the original Surf Club opened New Year's Eve 1930 as the playground for Miami's elite. Four Seasons took over the 9-acre oceanfront site and opened in 2017, preserving key historical elements - the original 1930s chandeliers still hang in the public spaces, and if you look up in the lobby, you can see the original surf club tiling on the roof. This is a Four Seasons property that truly maintains a sense of place while also integrating modern elements in a way that feels both timeless and current. I really loved it.

**About me:** I am an advisor on [u/sarahwlee](https://www.reddit.com/user/sarahwlee/)’s team. I travel about 12+ish weeks a year with my kids so generally speaking my trip reports include perspectives on whether properties are family friendly or not. In this instance I was without them (which was blissful - my Oura sleep scores were mid-90s every night) when I visited, but I would definitely travel here with kids.

**Accommodations:**

Intimate by Miami standards - just 77 guest rooms and 25 suites spread across multiple floors with only 9 rooms per floor.

**Standard Rooms** All rooms except the lead-in category include balconies. Every room is exterior connecting - there are no interior connectors at all. While I appreciate connecting rooms, especially in other hotels where there may not be a lot of multi-bedroom suite options, it was nice here because the rooms were dead quiet. I heard no noise from other guests and the hotel was at occupancy while we were there.

I stayed in an oceanfront room with two doubles and the view was genuinely spectacular - and the room itself was spacious and beautiful. Plenty of room to spread out, generous closet space, and I appreciated that the toilet was separate from the rest of the bathroom.

**Suites** Suites range from 1-4 bedrooms and occupy their own dedicated floor. Important note: suites don't typically fall into standard upgrade tiers (meaning if you book a 1bd you’re not getting upgraded to a 2bd). The oceanfront 4-bedroom suites (only two exist) and the 3-bedroom Penthouse are the top-tier options.

**Five Ocean Bungalows** Best option for couples. Private ocean verandas and a completely different experience from the tower rooms - these are for guests who want maximum privacy and direct beach access.

**Dining:**

We ate at every outlet and the food was consistently very good to excellent. Breakfast is at **Lido**, the Italian restaurant housed in the original ballroom. I appreciated that it’s not a buffet and is ala carte. My personal litmus test for five-star hotels is a proper club sandwich - both in room service and at the restaurant/bar. The champagne bar serves one version, room service serves another (they're different!), and both were outstanding. The room service club sandwich specifically is both of its place and easily in my top five ever eaten. Nothing will probably ever beat Park Hyatt Tokyo's version, but this comes remarkably close.

**The Surf Club Restaurant** delivered an excellent meal - refined without being stuffy, with service that matched the quality of the food. Unlike many other TK restaurants, dress was a range from suits and gowns to jeans and suit jackets to some getups that looked like they stepped directly out of da clerb.

**Champagne Bar:** Holds the largest champagne selection in Florida. If you take your bubbles seriously, have fun here. One gripe is that in the evening the music is loud. I feel so lame and old saying this, but it was hard to hear over the din of the music.

**Spa & Fitness:**

The gym is legitimately excellent - well-equipped, spacious, with quality machines and good layout.

Small, elegant spa with hammam/steam/sauna and Biologique Recherche treatments.

Two pools (one adults only and one for family). Large lawns, lots of seating, and very attentive pool staff. Loungers and service on the beach as well.

Huge, beautiful Kids For All Seasons kids club, open daily 9:30-4, kids aged 4-12. They had tons of fun activities for kids and I think kids under about 8/9 would have a grand old time here.

**Service:**

This is where Four Seasons consistently earns its reputation. Our Chromecast wasn't working (which is how you control music in the room), and they sent someone up to fix it about 3 minutes after I messaged the FS App. I also accidentally broke one of the very fragile glass coffee cups - they came to clean it up so quickly I barely had time to feel embarrassed about it. Welcome amenities were thoughtful and generous. Room service was also fast.

The team is responsive, professional, and genuinely seems to enjoy working here, which always shows in guest experience.

**Vibes:** This is absolutely a place to see and be seen (if that's what you're after). The clientele skews well-dressed and polished - even the people in gym clothes were made up and put together. The guest mix is a wide range of couples, families, and well-heeled business travelers, many clearly treating this as their Miami home base. The people-watching alone was worth it.

**Final Takeaways:**

This is my favorite Miami property. The combo of 1930s glamour and modern Four Seasons service/execution, and the small scale keeps it feeling exclusive rather than overwhelming. Every detail has been considered, from the preservation of historical elements to the quality of a room service club sandwich. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.

**Who This Is For:**

* Clients who value understated luxury and historical significance over flashy opulence
* Couples seeking romance and intimacy (especially in the ocean bungalows)
* Travelers who prefer boutique scale to large resort atmospheres
* Design-conscious guests who appreciate preservation and thoughtful renovation
* Foodies and TK enthusiasts
* Families with kids
* Anyone seeking ocean views in a quieter, less party-centric area of Miami

**Who This Is Not For:**

* Travelers who want the full-service mega-resort experience with a very lively, busy lobby with multiple shops and a wide and varied selection of restaurants
* Anyone prioritizing contemporary design/newness over heritage
* People who want a scene or social atmosphere - this is intimate and refined & nights are quiet. Common areas empty early.
* Budget-conscious travelers",22,1769949184.0,FATTravel,3,0.83,False

So after we broke up, I removed pictures of us from my instagram, turned off life360 etc. like a normal break up. A few days later she messaged me saying, “why have you paused life360” and “why have you removed all our pictures from instagram”. Now I told her that I would turn my life360 on if she kept hers on, idk why tbh but I did. And in regards to instagram she still has all of our pictures up on hers after 3 weeks apart? 

I don’t get is she expecting us to get back together? I just think it’s very mixed signals, when we broke up, we said we would go for a coffee after a month apart and see how we feel about things. And that she just needed time and space to herself. 

If anyone had any advice on any of this, would be appreciated. ",1,1769948943.0,AvoidantBreakUps,5,1.0,False

1qsx75d,https://i.redd.it/4rknqzhrmvgg1.png,A slow-paced first solo travel — Baguio,"I posted 2 months ago about my plan to go & have a solo trip in Baguio. I just wanna say thank you so much to those who took their time to give great recos to me as those helped me a lot in picking the best things to do in Baguio.

It's inexplicable to say how much I enjoyed my slow-paced travel there. I wasn't really able to go to a lot of places & do all the things people here recommended but I am planning to go back in December & try going to other places I didn't get to visit.

Here's what I did:

Day 1
• Rest for about 2 hours before going out, then visited Cornelia St. Bistro House (I'm a lowkey swiftie and I enjoyed my time there until 6pm).
• I rode a jeepney to General Luna then walked to SM Baguio (I loved this experience, I was just wandering around).
• I had a nice sight-seeing activity in SM Baguio as that's the first time I saw the night view of Baguio from the top.
• I walked around the session road then I went to the night market before 9pm but vendors were still preparing that time.
• Once I was done eating, I decided to go back to my transient home and appreciate the city lights through my window. 🌌

Day 2
• I woke up a bit late. I wanted to wake up around 5am as I planned to go to Mt. Kalugong, but I woke up at around 6:30am. 😅
• At around 7:20, I was waiting for a jeep to the city proper (I realized my accomm. isn't really that near to the city proper but I loved it still as it's very peaceful & I won't trade the view from the window of my room for convenience).
• I was finally in Mt. Kalugong but the way up there was hard haha. I only walked, but it's possible to ride a van, I still loved the experience tho! ✨
• When I finally get there, ahhh.. I was ecstatic! 😭
• There were no other people in Kape-an aside from the owner/staff, so I enjoyed being there alone, but not lonely.
• I carefully climbed through the lime rock formations & enjoyed the view from there. (I didn't get to have a picture of me sitting on the rock as I was there solo, I only had selfies & of course, pics. of the view hehe).
• After taking my time there daydreaming, I went back down to go to the part of the place on the picture here & tried to take quick photos of me looking over the whole place (It was so hard to take pics. w/o anyone or even a tripod haha).
• I spent half of my day there, it was almost 1pm when I decided to go back & funny 'coz I was supposed to go to other places; instead, I slept all afternoon in my room after crying my heart out (My papa's 2nd death anniversary is on this day & I missed him).
• I prepared before going to the city proper & had a fancy dinner at the Cafe by the Ruins.
• I went to the night market to buy little souvenirs for my siblings, then went back to my accommodation, took a bath, then sleep.


Day 3
I woke up at 5am, got myself ready, then went to Mirador Heritage Ecopark.
• I took my time there again, I was just happy to roam around & take random pictures. Time flies! I was planning to go to the Yellow Trail in Camp John Hay, but I was already running out of time. 😔
• I ate & drink hot tea in Foam Coffee, but didn't get to finish my tea there as I bought bread & pastries from Victoria's Bakery, then went back to check-out from my transient home at 11am.
• I left my luggage at SM's tourist lounge, before heading to the bus terminal & booked an afternoon ticket to PITX.
• The only available seats were 16 (middle area), 23, & 24 (both at the back part of the bus). I chose seat 16 despite not knowing who the person next to me will be (also, i easily get dizzy & i usually take bonamine before riding a bus).
• It turned out, it was a guy who had read my reddit post before! Haha. He also went to Baguio alone and our vibes clicked immediately (well, not in a romantic way). We talked about a lot of diff. things, topics you won't even think about daily haha. We had a wholesome & genuine conversation, as if the universe wanted us to end our solo journeys with an enchanting encounter... and even I had to take another bus to finally be home, I was still thinking about everything I've experienced. I reminisced the whole journey with a longing, yet grateful heart.
I'll be back. 🤍

Thank you for reading until here! To those who are planning to go & have your solo travel, I don't know how much time you need to finally be able to do it, but even now, I am proud of you. 🙂",73,1769948891.0,phtravel,4,0.99,False

I’d thought about this for a lot of time and for a lot of things, not only coffee but anything that can be produced.

You see, I live in Dominican Republic, a third world country or in development if you fancy. We do have a Coffe culture in the sense that people like Coffe and live for Coffe but not in the sense to know about quality coffee or coffee even what’s to be considered a good Coffe.

Years ago I went to this highly rated cafeteria called Ciao and I found out their Espresso to be burn out BUT then again I live here and I’m Dominican so I don’t know if I’m correct. I even made a review on Google Maps and the owner answered me telling that I didn’t know shit on how a real espresso it’s make in Italy (he’s supposed to be Italian or have the heritage) but again precisely for living here in DR if I can identify one quality of coffee, I would said it should be its burned as that’s the major constant in our coffee culture, of course I don’t even know if in an espresso machine you can produce a burned cup, much less at the industrial level of this machines.

Anyway I went yesterday again, after a lot of years, and a little better knowledge because I’d tasted more espressos in my travels, no so many cities sadly, and the result was the same. The irony on this it’s that recently I’d discovered that in the place where I wash my car (a car wash) they made a lovely espresso which I tasted balanced, no so sweet but certainly not bitter or burned, just perfect and on point. I guess for now this would be my place to go.

Again, it would be so amazing to live in a society that has access to correct or perfected version of products.

If you know in San Juan Puerto Rico and/or Bogotá Colombia where I definitely can tasted how an espresso should taste, please leave it in the comments so I can go there in a couple of months.
