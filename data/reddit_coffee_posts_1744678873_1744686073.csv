1jzhhh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jzhhh0/electric_entry_level_grinder/,Electric Entry Level Grinder,"Have seen several posts in the community asking similar questions—including one last week—but wanted to add some specificity.

Relatively new to coffee, using a V60 style pour over that I was gifted, and then invested in a Greater Goods scale. I was also handed down a blade grinder, and I’ve been using it long enough now to realize it’s terrible and that I need to “graduate” to a burr grinder. 

I’d like to spend ~$200, which seems to be about the minimum to get a halfway decent grinder. I was intrigued by the Breville and Kitchen Aid grinders in this range, but those seem to be “overkill” as I would prefer single dose, and would stick almost exclusively to pour over. (I don’t foresee much interest/need in the future to brew espresso or other brewing methods at home.) I’ve heard good things about the Baratza Encore and Fellow Opus as well—though I was disappointed to see the Opus in store and realize it was fully plastic and appeared relatively cheap. Through more research, I think I am leaning towards the Turin SD40 or SK40, but am unsure of their performance for things other than espresso.

TL;DR
Beginner looking for ~$200 electric burr grinder for pour over. No need to be portable or switch easily between grind size. Unsure of stepped vs. stepless.

I’m Male in my early 20s, but I’ve never really fit the “typical 20-something” box. I’m the guy who believes in handwritten notes, eye contact that says more than words, and slow dancing in the kitchen just because a good song came on. I’m not here for games, ego trips, or swiping until my thumbs fall off. I’m here looking for a connection with depth, warmth, and good energy.

I’m hoping to meet a woman in her 30s or 40s someone radiant in her presence, soft in her strength, and unafraid to laugh deeply or speak her truth. Someone who’s lived through storms and sunshine and still chooses to show up with heart. I admire that kind of energy. I’m not here to fix or impress I’m here to build, grow, and explore.

I’m the type of guy who wants to explore the world, even if it starts with the coffee shop down the street. I want to try new things food, music, art, hiking trails I’ll probably get lost on (but laugh the whole way), and dive into conversations that make us lose track of time. I’m always down to learn about culture, history, cooking, love languages… or even how to not burn toast (it’s a journey). 

I want to learn with someone. Learn new places, new flavors, new cultures, and new parts of ourselves. Let’s get lost in hidden bookstores, dive into spontaneous road trips, watch the stars until 3am, or just chill on a Sunday morning with strong coffee and stronger conversation. Teach me something you love I’ll be listening. 

I’m respectful, intentional, and lowkey funny once you get past my “mystery guy with good manners” energy. I’ve got a good heart, a curious mind, and a love for genuine connection over shallow noise. If you or someone you know is ready for something that feels real, rich, and a little romantic I’m all ears.

You bring the stories, I’ll bring the energy. Let’s see where it goes.

1jzha4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/1jzha4a/fabulous_and_free_nurturing_mental_health_as_a/,Fabulous and Free: Nurturing Mental Health as a Femboy,"Hey there, you radiant soul! Being a femboy is like wearing your heart on your sleeve—bold, beautiful, and unapologetically you. But let’s be real: life can throw curveballs that test even the sparkliest of spirits. That’s why prioritizing mental health is your VIP pass to thriving, not just surviving. Here’s how to keep your inner glow shining bright, with a dash of humor and a whole lot of optimism.

First, let’s talk life. Embracing your femboy identity is like dancing to your own playlist—sometimes you’ll trip, but the beat keeps going. Mental health is the rhythm that keeps you moving. It’s okay to have off days; even glitter needs a moment to settle. Practice self-care like it’s your favorite hobby—whether that’s journaling, meditating, or belting out show tunes in a bubble bath. Small habits, like a daily gratitude list, can rewire your brain to spot the rainbows, even on cloudy days.

Now, about those pesky bad habits and addictions—think of them as glitter bombs that seem fun but leave a mess. Breaking free starts with self-compassion. Caught yourself doom-scrolling or stress-eating glitter-dusted cupcakes? Laugh it off, then swap one habit for a healthier one. Try a five-minute walk instead of that third coffee. Progress, not perfection, is the goal. You’re not a robot; you’re a fabulous human learning to sparkle smarter.

Forging supportive relationships is like curating the ultimate squad. Surround yourself with folks who cheer your authenticity, whether they’re IRL besties or online allies in SFW spaces like this one. Share your joys, vent your struggles, but keep your privacy sacred—think of it as a velvet rope around your personal VIP zone. You don’t owe anyone your whole story, but opening up to trusted pals can lift weights you didn’t know you carried.

Here’s the truth: you’re already a masterpiece, femboy flair and all. Mental health isn’t about “fixing” you—it’s about polishing the gem you are. So, ditch the self-doubt, nurture your soul, and build connections that vibe with your magic. This community’s got your back, and every step you take is a strut toward a happier you.

It was a brisk Monday in Seattle—the kind where your salted caramel cold foam deflates mid-sip. I had just stepped off my private jet from Newport Beach, clutching my monogrammed Yeti tumbler, thinking fondly of my baristas back home. I was tired. I was vulnerable. I needed comfort.

I stepped into the Pike Street Starbucks expecting what I always expect: a seamless, standardized experience. Familiar faces—not because I know them, but because they all look the same. That’s the beauty of the apron. It equalizes. Smooths. Standardizes.

But here—here, there was chaos.

A barista stood before me in a burgundy Henley. Another wore light-wash jeans that clung to self-expression like static to polyester. A third? A lavender Coffeegear crewneck—lavender, as if to mock me.

I froze.

Where was my army of coffee-making shadows?
Where were the silent, apron-bound avatars I could trust to Sharpie my cup and never speak out of turn?

“Where… am I?” I whispered.

“Welcome in!” chirped one of them—with the smug confidence of a nose ring and a floral bandana. She looked… content. As if she wasn’t on the verge of tears from mobile orders and understaffed weekends. Suspicious.

“No,” I said, voice cracking. “That tone—those pants—that shirt. The apron is supposed to erase you, not frame you.”

She blinked. “Sorry?”

I backed out slowly, nearly crashing into a chalkboard. I collapsed onto a bench, heart pounding. A crow landed nearby. We locked eyes. I saw no judgment—only indifference. It understood me.

The apron was supposed to mean something.

It was supposed to say: This one is mine. This one will make my drink, absorb my microaggressions, and smile like a beige ghost.

But when the baristas start thinking they’re people, the whole thing collapses.

The next morning, I called a crisis meeting. “We need unity,” I declared, pacing in front of a slideshow titled Color Theory and the Death of the American Coffeehouse. “We need order.”

Solid black. Khaki. Blue denim. Approved cuts only. No whimsy. No flare.

Thus, the May 12th dress code was born.

But that night, alone in my corner office, sipping lukewarm matcha and refreshing our stock price, a new fear crept in.

What if—what if—I walked into a store in Ohio and was greeted not by a Jayden, but a Brayden? Or worse… a Kaidence with two i’s and a silent “gh”?

My hands clenched.

Names, I thought. Names could be standardized too.

Perhaps someday, every store will have a Casey. A Taylor. A Chris. Interchangeable. Polite. Unmemorable.

As a Fort Worth business owner, you've probably realized that having a strong online presence isn't just nice to have—it's essential. I'm Alex Rodriguez, founder of [Lone Star Web Solutions](https://coderlift.com/), and after 12+ years of building WordPress websites for businesses across the DFW Metroplex, I've seen firsthand how the right website can transform a local business.

# Why Choose a Local Fort Worth WordPress Developer?

Y'all know that feeling when you're trying to explain what you want to someone who just doesn't get Fort Worth? That's the challenge many business owners face when working with out-of-state or overseas developers.

When you partner with a local [Fort Worth WordPress developer](https://coderlift.com/services/), you're getting someone who understands that a business in the Cultural District has different needs than one in the Stockyards or Near Southside. We know the local market because we live and breathe it every day.

The benefits go beyond just local knowledge:

* **Face-to-face meetings** that build stronger relationships and clearer communication
* **Local accountability** (we might run into you at Joe T. Garcia's, after all!)
* **Understanding of regional SEO considerations** to help you rank for local searches
* **Knowledge of what appeals to Fort Worth customers** across different neighborhoods

One of my clients, a boutique owner on Magnolia Avenue, put it best: ""Having a web developer who can meet me for coffee to discuss my site is worth its weight in gold.""

# Where to Find WordPress Developers in Fort Worth

Looking for the perfect WordPress partner? Here's where to start your search:

# Freelance Platforms

Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr let you connect with independent developers. While you'll find plenty of talent here, you'll need to vet carefully to ensure they have local Fort Worth expertise.

Sites like [Clutch.co](http://Clutch.co) provide ratings and reviews of development companies. Filter by location to find Fort Worth specialists with proven track records.

# What Sets Fort Worth WordPress Developers Apart

There's something special about Fort Worth web developers. Maybe it's our blend of Texas hospitality and technological know-how, but local developers tend to approach projects with a unique perspective.

""We're not just building websites,"" as my lead developer Maria likes to say, ""we're building digital storefronts for our neighbors.""

Most Fort Worth WordPress specialists emphasize the following:

* **Relationship-based business** rather than transactional interactions
* **Longer-term partnerships** instead of one-and-done projects
* **Community-minded development** that considers how your site represents Fort Worth

# The WordPress Development Process: What to Expect

Working with a local Fort Worth developer typically follows these steps:

1. **Initial Consultation** \- Often over coffee at Avoca or at your place of business

It was wordy before perhaps this is some issue internally. I'm chatting and no word trully feels akin to some greater message strewn in the chat. Haven't quite had coffee either in a while. Can you feel that there is no string tying my messages together? I need to focus and I just noticed this. Yet I can focus and I have been productive today... this is the longest I have gone without coffee in a while (three-ish weeks technically).

I have so much to do that I haven't started but time seems to be flowing slower and for that I am thankful. My mind is in no rush and I type slowly yet... previously I typed rushedly cause my mine was constantly rushed and active. Then I calmed at last and everything fit just fine and now its blurred apart... some sort of extreme calm if you can call it that. I'm empty but not void of anything. Just air... and I fly up into the sky nebulously.

What the effing?

So I just feel at peace but should I? No drugs or anything, sober of all distraction listening to calm slow music to keep my mind at rest. Not too worried about the fact that I am behind. I attempted to chat online, noticed how I felt. Yet coffee jerked my mind around into pure panic.

All feels disjointed yet Irise into the sky floating through the clouds, thats how I feel. Wheres the stress I should but, rather, cannot feel? Whats the point? I haven't journaled in a couple days and possibly this fits it best.

Now nothing about any of that was out of the ordinairy but his physical appearance really took me aback. First his skin was incredibly jaundiced and sallow, like nothing I've ever seen before. Second, his eyes were dark and beady, and he was squinting so hard that I was wondering how he could see out of them. Third, he had two big prominent buck teeth that were jutting out. I found myself completely disturbed by him even if though he was acting completely normally.

* **Drip tray issues**: ""*I seriously want someone to start selling a 3D printed version of this drip tray that doesn't leak.*"" (10 upvotes)
* **Limited temperature control**: ""*You are referring to a low temp setting in your post but the Bambino Plus has no setting to adjust temperature of the coffee extraction. You can only adjust the milk temperature.*"" (38 upvotes)
* **Preset limitations**: ""*I find with the bambino I only manually pull by holding the 2 cup button until the pump comes on, let it pre infuse for a few seconds, and then go. Presets are crap.*"" (14 upvotes)

# Positive Experiences

* **Fast heat-up time**: ""*I feel so spoiled with its thermojet tech. I turn it on, grind my coffee, pull my shot, and i'm done in 3 minutes tops. Love not waiting 10 minutes for it to get up to temp.*"" (18 upvotes)
* **Reliability**: ""*I make 2-3 americanos every day and neither product has had so much as a hiccup. I have zero regrets.*"" (41 upvotes)
* **Milk steaming capability**: ""*The auto frothing is definitely capable of latte art quality milk. Depending on the amount of milk and the temp/foam settings, it's more than capable.*"" (39 upvotes)
* **Value proposition**: ""*Bambino Plus is a great value proposition for high quality espresso and milk drinks for an extremely reasonable price.*"" (21 upvotes)
* **Beginner-friendly**: ""*I have a Bambino plus and a DF54. They are my first machines (both grinder and espresso). I find them to be the perfect balance of good enough that I can make great coffee, fiddly enough that I can dial in different beans but not too fiddly that I'm constantly unhappy due to my own inexperience.*"" (41 upvotes)

# Side Effects/Concerns

# Maintenance Issues

* **Proper workflow**: ""*People in this thread fundamentally don't understand how coffee machines work.

1jzgrt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayChristians/comments/1jzgrt6/alone_forever/,Alone forever(?),"Hey, I'm a 19 year old Christian bisexual trans man. I've known for a long time about my gender and sexuality, but it took me a while to come to terms with it in my faith and my walk with Jesus. 

I don't have any shame for who I am, in fact most of the time when I'm most accepting of myself is when I'm closest to Jesus. 

However, I recently entered my first ever relationship (took me a while I know). It lasted 6 months and I loved every minute of it. They were smart, charming, Christian, they respected my boundaries, and made me feel so comfortable with myself to the point where I'd still feel just as masculine without my binder. It was amazing.

But I found out they were cheating on me the whole time we were together.

(If you want to read the crazy story behind that [it's worth it i promise], if not, you can skip ahead to the next paragraph):

My whole family is very conservative and very against queer people (my grandpa said they should make it legal to shoot queer people and that would ""fix"" this generation). The only person who knew about my relationship was my Aunt who found it out by accidentally coming across my preferred name written somewhere. Im scared to tell my family in general because I don't think I would be safe, but my Aunt is slightly better because all she'll do is yell + argue with me, but then pretend nothing happened and im still straight and cis. Anyways, about a month after she found out I was in a relationship, she invited me over to a house where she was house sitting. I was excited and my Uncle showed up too so it was chill. After playing games, my Aunt switched off the tv and turned to me. All she knew about my partner at the time was their name (possibly only their first name). She pulled up a photo of them and showed it to me. ""Is this [partner's name]?"" ""Yes..."" I answered, already not feeling good about the situation. She then proceeded to show me multiple photos of them and this other trans guy (i mention trans because it is one of the MANY similarities we both had). This other guy was a similar height, similar face, similar style, similar humor (based off the posts), and even similar names. I was angry, not only because I found out I was getting cheated on for 6 months, but also because my Aunt and Uncle had to SEARCH to find this because I couldn't even find it after hours of looking for it until I got the exact user name. (Im not big on social media). I was crying, and confused, and embarrassed. My Aunt then turned to my Uncle, ""I brought him and told him everything because I thought he would have some good input on the situation."" My Uncle then awkwardly piped up, ""Yeah, I mean even as a driver's ed instructor, I see kids go through heartbreak all the time... There was even this one girl whose boyfriend cheated on her and physically abused her and they were together for years and she was 15 with 3 other abusive boyfriends. She also didn't know how to spell. Like she spelled space like ""S-P-A-Y-C"", really shows you how downhill our education system has gone-"" They then both went on talking about the education system for a good 10 minutes while im having a full-on mental breakdown. Whatever, I take a shower and do some stalking. After my uncle leaves, my Aunt tries to empathize with me by telling about her ex-boyfriend who had sex with another women on my Aunt's own bed and how she was just going to leave and let it happen. She then brushed it off and pretended like nothing ever happened. We went to bed and I slept in the LIVING ROOM on the COUCH with a blanket that smelled like DOG, sobbing about everything and how dumb I must be to trust someone who would lie to me throughout our whole relationship. My Aunt scrolled on her phone. At some point in the night, a very cold night (15°), my Aunt opened this sliding door, so I was freezing for half the night with no reason why. The next morning, we went to get coffee before church. I was disassociating and my Aunt was trying to get me to focus so I could order. After that, I got in my car, and she in hers, and I cried on the whole drive to the church (like 30-45 min). NOW, this church is the closest thing to a CULT I've ever experienced. I get there and it's small, but there's only like 15 people in the whole church (less than 1/3 of the pews). Obviously, everyone is going to notice the new guy. This church says the pledge of allegiance before ANYTHING ELSE and then pledge to Christian flag and Bible. Im already like wtf am i doing here and im silently sobbing through the whole thing). The pastor then points me out and everyone stares at me, ""I see we have a visitor today! Aunt, who is this?"" ""This is my niece, [deadname]!"" The pastor then smiles and grabs a box. My aunt turns to me and says, ""He won't leave unless you take something!"" The piano starts playing and they all start singing this song, I don't remember how it goes, but it's something like: ""Welcome guest! We are blessed to have you, welcome, welcome, welcome, we're so glad God brought you."" Mind you, this church ONLY sings hymns, so this was WACKY. The pastor then DANCES up to me (i wish I was making this up) and holds the box out to me. I grab something random and look at it. Now, out of all the things you would guess this object would be, I bet you'd get every single one wrong. Because i pulled out a 3D ufo eraser with a little alien in it and a glass dome over its head. Okay, whatever, weird, but im too busy LITERALLY CRYING WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING to notice how insane that was. We move on to the sermon and the pastor starts off well saying how we shouldn't let all of our purpose and control be in/on other people, but rather give control to God. Good. Great. Then he switches to substances, saying how we shouldn't give control to them or rely on them for our happiness. Okay, yeah, sure. Then he switches to we shouldn't be putting all our happiness in non-christian artists because all they sing about is SAD and ANGRY things and the purpose of music is to glorify God, so HOW DARE ALL OF YOU (pointing to everyone in the pews) LISTEN TO SUCH SINFUL CRAP, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT!!! And nobody batted an eye. This actually made me feel better because of how dumb it was. Like if you don't want to listen to non-christian music, then don't. But this pastor was acting like it was a sin to even sing about something that's not God. When really, the act of creating music can be God-glorifying. Like that one verse ""Let all that you do be glorifying to God"". Sure, there could be some songs out there that you feel convicted about and decide to not listen to anymore, but im not gonna go around screaming about how someone is sunful cause they enjoy a Taylor Swift song every once and a while. Like what????? Anyways, fast-forward (my aunt never said another word about the whole incident), I'm calling my partner. We go on a break and eventually break up. Turns out, they had been dating other guy before we started dating. And their relationship was an ""open-relationship"". I tried to ask why they did it and they didn't really have an answer besides degrading themselves and praising me over and over and kind of pushing me to just break up with them because they were too ""pussy"" (their words) to break up with one of us. We never had sex, (im waiting til marriage for personal reasons), but them and this random dude were banging throughout our relationship although, apparently, ""they were trying to slowly break it off with the other person because they were scared that he would react like a psychopath if they broke up with him"". 

Anyways, I was stupidly looking for a rebound while trying to convince myself I wasn't. And I installed 3 dating apps and was looking around me. I couldn't find anyone who was queer, Christian, sober, and had mutual attraction. I kid you not, within 100 miles, I could not find anyone. Even in my last relationship, they were one of the last available profiles and we just happened to hit it off.

This took a big hit to my mental being because it's been over a month and I'm so alone and really losing hope that there is someone who meets all these standards. I was even considering gor a while, going back to my ex because ""I won't be able to do better"". 

I guess all I'm asking is if anyone has any advice on finding someone who is passionate in their faith and also queer? People in loving, queer, Christian relationships, how did you find your partner?

""Hey! Excuse me! Am I just not getting through to you!"" He swung the piece of shit uzi thing at the ceiling and let off a few rounds. 
""Are we feeling more alert now?"" He screamed towards me. Despite how distant he was I could smell the coffee and cigarette smoke that stained his teeth and stupid mustache.

""Okay then maybe this will help ya out."" He smugly said and pulled the trigger. A sharp ringing let out and a burst of red mist shot out my coworkers chest. Steven. My only friend in this hell hole.

When he dropped down, he clashed around dramatically. His station turned upside down from his fall. The spraying of red everywhere and all over the robber. Our manager Ricky ripped off the mask furious. 
""God damn it you two!"" His face is red with anger. 
""You fucked with the squibs again!"" 
I at this point was practically falling over laughing. 
"" Shut the fuck up you two! These robbery drills are serious!"" He continued on after his statement towards the two of us. But we have these once a month and after five years of working here we have not been robbed once. 
Starting my day off like this was sadly way too normal.

"" Here at Babylon Banking we take care of your money, Or you can have it back!""  The dumbest slogan for anything, let alone a bank. And to be honest why the hell do we have a slogan. I asked myself that when I applied for the janitor position. Having been outta highschool for a few years and not wanting to do anything involving college. My parents kicked me out and Steven let me move in. He was already working there as a janitor himself and recommended me. Getting hired was easy enough, even without it, the interviewer was this stout man who asked basic questions. Why do I want to work here, what are my strengths and weaknesses. Typical stuff, until he kinda just switched up the questions. Have you even been declared legally insane? No. Are you religious at all? No. Are you afraid of the dark? No.  All the sudden out of the box questions weirded me out, I get freaked out a little easier than most people. But I'm also like most people and my fears faded away after I heard the pay they would offer me.

I answered all but one truthfully. 

And from there I was a janitor and then bumped up to the mail room and so on till where I am now. Covered in fake blood laughing at the man who first hired me. 
"" You fucking two are something else!"" Ricky said as he tossed paper towels around us to clean. He began to walk off but stopped his hate filled steps.
"" Actually, Jason."" His words had a hint of malicious intent, so great now Stevens little joke is gonna get my ass chewed out. He fully turned around his fake gun pointing towards me still. Even though it wasn't real and only shot blanks it still unease me. And he knew that.
"" Go ahead and get changed. Steven can finish this up, I have a task for you. Meet me in my office when you're ready"" 

And like a good little worker I listened, honestly a little happy. Steven gave a weak wave as I hurried along. Those squibs are very powerful if not properly set up, like for a joke perhaps. I saw him rubbing his chest. I turned a corner towards the locker room where I kept my backpack and monthly new suit. I saw the maze of cubicles full  of the older workers and HRs door slightly open. Ms.Rose our hr lady had one of our oldest workers there some 60 something year old. I could slightly see his watery eyes and her hand pass over an envelope.  That was another thing about this place, you know besides the constant fake robbers. I've never seen anyone be fired for any real reason, not for being late constantly, being a no call no show, practical jokes . We work in a contract style, at least to my understanding, each time mines about to run out I get promoted that's all I really understand. But the only way I've seen anyone leave here is when they, as corporate puts it, age out. Its weird working here. But I ignored the sad old man and made my way to the lockers. Changed my bloody clothes and walked my ass to his office. 

I approached his door praying that he wasn't there yet so I could have a small break waiting on him. But alas God sometimes doesn't want me to be satisfied, as for before I could even knock, Ricky was opening the door.
""Come on in Jacob."" He said calmly but the red stains on his face and shirt say other wise. I know he's pissed and I'm honestly wondering if I'll be the first under fifty person to be fired from Babylon Banking. 
""Take a seat Jacob, but don't get comfy."" Fuck I must be getting fired. I thought that to myself as  I hazardly sat down in the black office chair. 
"" Jacob we here a Babylon Banking, well we do things differently than your average bank, now wouldn't you agree?"" I shook my head in agreeance. My eyes wandering over to the rubber mask of his own face he wore earlier. The fake blood covering it. He spoke again and regained my attention.
"" Yes yes, well buddy because of that stunt you and Steven pulled I'm gonna have to let you go-"" 
""Now wait a second it was his idea.""  His hand halted my interruption.
"" Don't be rash, I'm gonna have to let you go down to the vaults to do Stevens job. You're being promoted to his position."" 
"" But why?"" I knew it was dumb to question a promotion but I didn't want Steven to be outta a job.
"" Don't worry Stevens been here for a while now and now he gets to be with people more, how should I put it, experienced just like him. So forget the shit you knew about bank teller stuff. Now you work the vaults."" The vaults he's referring to are our two banking vaults, obviously, and it was Stevens job for the past year or so to take down these giant containers down there to I guess unload them. He never elaborated about what he did , only something about precious information. 
"" So go ahead and take a small break, I'll give ya ten minutes, then meet Steven by the elevators."" 

Twenty minutes later and I'm standing by the elevators, waiting for ten. Steven is nowhere to be seen, and now I've had some workers I've never met  bring me two little carts with bags of money on them. Another ten minutes pass and with the two carts I just decided to take initiative and do it myself how hard can it be. So I click the basement button and make my way down.
The smell of metal surrounds me as it  slowly makes it way down. I swear I can taste the metal the air. Five minutes passed and I was still not at the basement. Another five passed, I even considered that I wasn't moving but when I hopped up I could feel that yes I was still traveling down.
"" What the fuck is taking so long-"" and as if it was listening to me, the elevator opened it doors. Opened them to a dark hallway, a single light every couple of feet barely illuminated the deep red carpet.  And at the end of the hall I could make out a painting hanging there. Ignoring my body's suggestion of just leaving I pushed and pulled the carts. Fighting the carpets attempts to hold my cart's wheels, I slowly made my way down the hall. The carts gave no help and it was a constant struggle to get them to move. It was like trying to take them through mud. But I made my way down stopping at the sign that pointed me to a hall that just seemingly appeared suddenly. This was the way to the vaults, yeah but there was more hallway and I still couldn't make out the painting that kept itself in my mind. I could only make out a single figure painted onto the canvas. Some kind of portrait. I stared down trying hard to see it, but to no avail. The remaining hall was tempting to explore, it all was so outta place I would never have expected this here it seemed so I don't know off putting I guess. But I had to continue moving as much as I goof around here, leaving money left alone seems bigger and definitely a fire able offense. Luckily the hall to the vaults weren't carpeted and were cheap flooring covered in stains from the countless times carts ran over them. Leading me right to the vaults. There sat a guard at some station who seemed shocked when I approached the desk. 
"" Aye bub where's the Steven guy?"" The guard asked me, standing up quickly I could feel the tension forming as he asked me. Watching his hand reach for his hip, I answered
"" Oh Ricky said for me to do this, I'm the new guy I guess you could say."" I was honestly a little freaked out. 
"" Ah I see y'all's twos got promoted."" He tipped his baseball cap at me,
"" Well the names Allen, as you can see I guard this here area. Keeping crooks and creeps out of the vaults."" He laughed.

""Well I'm neither, just tryna do my job. I gotta say I ain't gonna get used to that long ass elevator ride."" I laughed a bit till I noticed his perplexed look.
""What is that ten minute ride not that bad any more to ya?"" His look didn't change even after I said that.
"" It's a thirty second ride at most bub, what the hell are you talking about?""  He questioned me,
"" What? Hell no man and then there was that long ass hallway with the red carpet."" He pointed to the elevator across the room from us. 
""That's the elevator you came down right?"" 
Standing there like an idiot, I just gazed at the doors. They seemed to mock me, the shiny gloss showing me a twisted reflection that laughed at my confusion. 
""Uh I think.""
"" And you saw a hall with red carpet?""  Allen asked me his tone one of authority like my body knew it shouldn't, no couldn't lie to him.
"" Yes sir, I came out and struggled to pull the carts through."" I answered. He smiled.
"" Then followed a sign to here."" I continued.
He looked at me then I saw his eyes dart behind me. I turned and followed, nothing just the hall entrance I came through and the elevator. As I was looking he yanked the cart out of my grip making me jump. Moving it into the first vault, he then he began to shut it the hinges screaming out like banshees. My ears hurt as he slowly shut the door. He  kept his eyes on me,  made his way past me and grabbed the second cart. And walked over to the second vault opposite of the first. He then turned to me and said with a smile.
"" Congrats on the promotion, and tell Steven I said good luck. He'll need it. Those cubicles will suck the life outta ya."" He smiled again and then sternly told me, 
""Leave the way you came.""  Then he went into the second vault. 

Thoroughly weirded out I turned towards the elevator, and began a journey back up top. My finger was about to press the button, but the thought of what Allen said hit me. Leave the way you came. I looked over at the opening I wheeled through, he couldn't have met that right? 
Well I walked over to it, turned the corner and felt my stomach drop. There was no hall. Only a set of stairs. Freaked out I turned around yelling,
""Hey Allen!"" But behind me was the red carpeted hallway. And a few feet from me was the portrait, a portrait of a lone man sitting in a chair. But his eyes were sulken in deeply almost empty pits. His cheeks just the same. He wore a suit colored navy blue, his hands where almost skeletal but what caught me was the right hand. It was pointing by the looks of it. I followed the fingers direction to another opening next the painting. I went to walk towards it, the carpet becoming harder and harder to walk through. As I approached I could feel each beat of my heart, what was happening to me was I insane. Was I blacking out or something how did I get here again, why the fuck am I here, and just where the fuck am I? Rounding the corner I saw it. A third vault. Rusty as hell and old as hell as well. It sat there outta place compared to the others. Ancient to them, to me. Then I heard the screams. They came from the vault but the doors were not opening. It sounds human it sounded pained. Then what I heard next sent me running down the hall, running towards the elevator door miles down the hall. 
""NOT YET!"" It echoed again behind me. The source unknown but just as unpleasant. 

I kept running and running trying to reach the elevator doors. But each step felt as if I was running in wet sand. Like the carpet itself was grabbing my shoes to slow me down. But I prevailed never stopping never letting the carpet take me and as soon as I pressed the button the doors swung open and I collapsed in the elevator. Breathing deeply and quickly I pressed the ground floor button and a few seconds later it opened up and I was back up top. 
And standing there was Ricky and Steven waiting for me. 
""How was it?"" Steven asked. 
""What the fuck do you mean how was it?"" I responded 
""Well you went down there by yourself, I'd imagine Allen gave you a hard time."" Steven stated. Theres no way he doesn't know about this right? About the creepy ass hallway or Allen's strange way of congrats. 
"" Oh yeah he did but he also said Good luck to you.""  He turned to Ricky, 
"" I guess news travels fast, yup buddy I got promoted. Leisure work life is what I'm doing now."" He said happily. But his happy demeanor was offset by the look Ricky was giving me. His eyes were screaming at me but his mouth didn't move. He put a hand on Steven and told us,
"" Alright it's been a day of ups and downs for you two. Why not go home and rest, y'all's gotta get trained tomorrow."" Ricky said his eyes never leaving mine.
I got up and went with Steven to our lockers passing by the cubicles again,  noticing the janitors emptying out one of them, just tossing everything into their containers. And the name Neil Goodman was all over the papers as we walked past. The name seemed familiar, but I couldn't recall from where. I'll ask Steven when we get home, I'm not excited for tomorrow.

I’ve been able to feel super anxious where I feel like I’m going to panic, and I’ve been crying (both good and bad feelings)","I'm not sure if it's because I reduced my Zoloft - it's actually likely, but I've even able to cry again, a lot. I got some good news today and ugly cried for like an hour. But also sad cried all weekend. I've even using music to help me feel.

I was blocked from feeling anything at all until I reduced my Zoloft from 50mg to 25mg. But my anxiety is also back. I can't drink coffee because it makes my nervous system go crazy. But on 50mg I could.

I think I need to be able to feel all this. But it's also a lot. I'm not afraid to panic because my mind is learning none of this is dangerous. With the medication, it was just numbing it all out and making me fear the feelings. So is this a good thing? 
 
My body feels very heavy and I feel extremely overstimulated. I feel like there's no happy medium. I'm either completely numb on Zoloft or feeling a bit overwhelmed. While im able to cry and feel deep sadness or even pride- there's no other positive emotions. I just always feel either anxiety, sadness or numbness. I'd also say that my DPDR is really bad right now too, and I live in 24/7 DPDR already.

Where is the bottom of the negative emotions? I feel like I'm an open wound that just doesn't stop bleeding. I either put pressure on it (numbness) or I let it bleed out (crying) but that wound never heal. The dissociation never stops. It's all just too much, or too little. When do I get windows of feeling good? I am so tired. So so tired after 3 years of this.

Looking at a broken watch, he looks at several old tv’s that flicker with recordings from the surrounding area. A disappointed sigh escapes Happy’s lips.

Happy: They really know how to make a girl wait…I mean I thought they would have been on the road much faster…maybe the CEO needs better moti—-ahhhh there we are.

A smile creeps across Happy’s face as a military grade carrier van appears on a dust coated screen. With a giddy laugh, Happy leaps to his feet and grabs a few small scalpels and a bear trap. Reaching into a pocket and pulling out a beaten up and rusted pocket watch, Happy nods a few times, muttering a simple countdown before disappearing. 

The lights in the truck flicker, on and off as if the rhythm of a heartbeat. Mr.Happy’s laughter echoes out for the occupants to hear before the entire back goes dark. When the lights come back on, Happy sits relaxed between two soldiers with a scalpel at each of their throats. 

Mr Happy: “Really Lieutenant? Only double digits? Shame. I thought I broke into the triple digits by now. Oh well these two are a good start.”

With the flick of his wrist, the blades slide across the two throats and let out a comforting spurt of crimson. The light’s flicker again, Happy and the dying men disappearing amongst the returning darkness and leaving the remaining behind. 

**- - - - - - - - - - - - -**

The driver sighs with boredom, having been relegated to driving for hours.  Reaching over with a low yawn, Corporal Janice Delahert picks up a tim hortons cup with coffee that had gone cold hours ago. Taking a  deep sip, she hears the muffled shouting in the back. With a low sigh, her hand reaches out to her walkie talkie. Lifting it to her mouth, it clicks to life.

Janice:  “Sir we're almost to the location. What happened back there?”

Before the lieutenant can reply, the bodies thud against the thick glass of the window.  Sliding down and leaving a viscous red trail, they bounce off the hood and their is a sickening crunch as the wheels come to an abrupt stop. Her finger still on the receiver, shock fills Janice for the first time in years.Janice: What the?!!

It’s then that Janice becomes aware of the passenger that is suddenly sitting beside her. Looking over to the Corporal, Mr.Happy smiles from ear to ear.Janice:How di? Wait, who are you?With a low sigh and an eye roll, Happy silently reaches over and begins to dig his thumbs into the woman’s eye sockets.Janice:No! Stop! Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!Those would be the last words any would hear from the poor corporal, as her finger fell off the receiver as Happy’s thumbs dug in deep. Pulling them out, and grabbing the back of the woman’s skull, it is with inhuman strength he sends her face first through the military grade glass. Her face is shredded as the jagged glass rips and tears on her way through it.Happy: Janice,.....Janice…you should have really worn a seatbelt…..Happy picks up the coffee and takes a small sip before spitting it out.Happy: Cold coffee…and I thought I was a psychopath.

Leaves crunch under boots as a pair of soldiers march to the front of the carrier van. Peering into the front, one of them wretches at the sight before him while the other chokes it back while looking on with disgust. Slowly the disgusted soldier lifts a walkie talkie to his mouth.Solider D: Sir..Y..you’re going to want to see this. As his finger leaves the call button, a blood hand clasps the man's shoulder.Happy: See what gents? .

The other soldier fumbles with his gun as he points it at the blood soaked mad man. Twisting his head at a most uncomforting angle, a much too wide grin crosses Happy’s face whilst locking eyes with the soldier. The gun shakes a bit as it trains on Happy’s head before the bang echoes out. It is with a speed only talked about in comic and myth, that the soldier’s compatriot is pulled into the bullet's path. Blood splatters across the nervous man's face as the bullet slams into his compatriot’s shoulder.

Soldier P:Jesus. What are you?!Dropping the man in pain on the ground, Mr.Happy’s smile continues to grow even bigger and wider.Happy: HappyWith a familiar lightning quick speed, a scalpel slams into the gun toting soldier's face whilst Happy’s foot digs deep into the other soldier's injured shoulder. Both can only scream in pain, as Happy rips the blade out and begins to stab and cut with a maddened glee. Whilst he begins to saw and peel the flesh off a man’s face, he hears the walkie talkie crackle to life.LSM: “Report! Shit! Okay change of plan. The four of us will proceed on foot. Mr Happy has already taken five of us out. I don't want to lose anymore.” 

“Larry. I hope you know how to use this……………  Larry doesn't like the bang bang.”

LSM: And I don't give a shit. Now take it!

The smile across Happy’s face ever so slowly sours, as he holds the man's face in his hands while listening to the still active comms . There was fun to be had and this…Lieutenant was ruining it…..and if there was anything that Happy hated it was someone ruining his fun. A soldier whom has been shot and stabbed repeatedly attempts to crawl away, coughing blood up with each breath he takes  is suddenly stopped. It’s quite obvious that the enjoyment has disappeared from Happy’s eyes as he forces the mans jaw open to rip out his tongue. Looking back at the walkie talkie, all Happy can think of is the Lieutenant.

Happy: Oh I'm going to enjoy gutting you

The tongueless man claws at his throat, whilst drowning in his own blood, as Happy tosses the faceless soldier into the passenger seat. A tongue freshly plucked now flops where a nose once was. With a click of his tongue, Mr.Happy looks at the bloody carnage and sighs.

Happy: That man really spoiled a mood…I think I’ll be a bit creative when I do him in.Stepping into the forest, Happy makes his way back to the decrepit cabin and prepares for his guests arrival.

Context: 30 years old. Single heterosexual male. No pets, plants, partners or criminal charges. A bachelor's degree in research psychology from University of St. Andrews in Scotland (didn't realize I was getting a useless degree). A follow up BSN-RN from a prestigious nursing school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin a few years later despite not knowing anything about the medical field and coming to realize I strongly dislike it (everything about it). 

Situation: I've decided I want to leave Milwaukee. I would also like to quit nursing. I'm not sure what to do, where to go, etc. 

Things I enjoy: music (I'm a musician in my free time and it's my passion), saunas, walking outside, drinking coffee, seeing movies (I love movies) and other basic things. 

The struggle: I've tried applying to endless remote nursing jobs and never seem to get selected. I've looked into CoolWorks but not sure how to do health insurance. Not really interested in travel nursing because the money is marginal post-covid for my specialty and the other realities of it (finding temporary housing, filing taxes returns in multiple states & social isolation). I've looked into welding but would need to attend tech school for 2ish years and then the ramp up to making what I made as a nurse would probably take a few more. 

So, what should I do? Where should I go?

Thank you in advance for your suggestions and wisdom!

# What’s This Course All About?

**Forex Training Group - High Probability Trading Using Elliott Wave and Fibonacci Analysis** is a deep-dive course built for traders who are tired of second-guessing the market.

Whether you're brand new or you've been around the block and still struggling to see consistency, this course wants to flip that script for you.

# Who’s Behind the Magic?

Meet **Vic Patel**, the brains behind this course. He’s not some overnight success story. Nope—he spent nearly a decade in the trenches before cracking the code to consistent profits. Once Elliott Wave and Fibonacci clicked for him, it was game over (in a good way). He turned those hard-earned insights into this course to help traders like you shortcut that long learning curve.

# When Should You Take This Course?

Honestly? The best time to learn was yesterday. The next best time is now. If you're currently floundering in the markets, this is a solid opportunity to reset your trading mindset.

The structure is well laid-out with modules, interactive quizzes, and even **bonus materials** like templates and handbooks.

# Why This Course? Why Now?

But **Forex Training Group - High Probability Trading Using Elliott Wave and Fibonacci Analysis** teaches a system. You’ll learn to spot impulse and corrective waves, time entries using Fibonacci ratios, and use supporting tools like RSI, SMA, and divergence like a pro. The goal is high probability setups, not gambling.

This course doesn’t just teach theory—it gives you **five specific trading setups**. You’ll see real-world trade examples, with entry points, stop losses, and targets clearly mapped out. These aren’t vague ""buy low, sell high"" tips. It’s precision trading.

I've become obsessed with this game, have spent more $$$ then I'd like to admit. But stuff like thus is really starting to turn me off... I mean there's lots that bug me about the game.

1) Gems are SO hard to acquire without paying money. Even when you do buy them, they don't last between refilling energy and trying to save an item from a bubble (300 for the mussels? You have to be joking!!)

2) The energy isn't enough. Especially when these generators pop out one goggles/tea/potatoe for every 40 duck/coffee/bread.

4) the special orders are painful. This pottery one I'm on takes up way too much space and the animals/bowls is as annoying as the tea/coffees.

5) the events are rigged to make you lose if you don't either dedicate your life, or pay to win them.

6) The rewards you get for chores etc. are so disproportionate to how much energy is needed to get there 

7) the ""gifts"" are lame. A white cup? 1 coin? You gotta be kidding.

1jzgewh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jzgewh/manual_grinder_for_dark_roast_pourover_coffee/,Manual Grinder For Dark Roast Pour-Over Coffee,"I drink medium-dark to dark roast coffee. The kind that can get astringent and bitter if you're not mindful of your grind and brewing temps. 

I make pour-over 99% of the time. I prefer body and complexity over clarity and precision. I won't be making espresso at home ever, so I'm not looking for the ability to grind that fine. 

I tried Aeropress and even after the learning curve found that I didn't prefer the more focused flavor, so I'm just going to be a pour-over and sometimes drip coffee guy. 

My question for the true conical burr wizards who have done their research and written papers is which manual grinder might be best for dark roast pour-over? 

I started with the Timemore C2 a few years ago, then upgraded to the 1zpresso Jx, which was much better, but I don't like the user experience, because I have to shake the grinder at the end of the grind to dislodge a bean or two that always gets stuck in the hopper and won't fall into the burr set without shaking. I also don't like the way the upper half of the body loosens when I grind. 

So I bought the KINGrinder K2 and it made better pour-over than the C2, but just barely below the Jx. It also feels cheaper in the hand (which obviously it is) and I don't care for the straight handle. Sadly, if I had bought the K2 first, after the C2 I'd be satisfied and think, ""okay I'm done."" 

So I bought the Comandante C40 on sale for $255 (a wood veneer even!) and I like the flavor I'm getting more than any of the others by a wide margin, but the catch cups are lame (both the glass and plastic ones), showing fingerprints and coffee oil too quickly, and the grounds get messy when they easily spill when they're being poured out over the shoulder/lip of the cup (if you've seen them up close you know), which none of the aluminum grinder catch cups have. I also don't like the cheap plastic cap on the handle. Head scratchers for such an expensive grinder. 

I'm currently looking at the 1zpresso K Ultra, J Manual, Q2 and the Timemore C3s. Considering that I will be only making dark roast pour-over that I prefer to have body and complexity and not clarity and precision, what are your qualified thoughts on those options? I'm not interested in the KINGrinder K6 because of that little metal pin I know I will either lose, or not be able to remove or put back in without damage, so please don't suggest it.

_Ugh. My head aches. I had 4 coffees already, I feel dizzy and tired. Maybe I should take some rest for a bit and be away from this bloody computer for a while._

Josh stood up and fixed his clothes. In a stature, he can easily scan the office if someone stays. He saw a computer lit up in the back end of the hallway. 

_Is it the accounting? Who is it?_

Josh strides across the hallway leading to the pantry and passing the lit computer. He saw no one on the seat but a cardigan and a bag left open. 

As he leaned and checked the papers, he saw someone's name.

_Ashley. Oh, the one who usually takes her coffee from the bakery near the station. I rarely see her take over time._

Josh continued his way to the pantry and heard a _soft, panting sound._ He was wondering if someone is playing pranks on him or an animal that got in the office. As the cold wind touched his nape, he suddenly felt nervous and his heart started beating fast. 

He approached the back end of the pantry where they keep all the dry and bread stuff. Slowly moving his feet, clenching his teeth and his eyes trying to gaze whatever's making the sound.

His eyes widened and suddenly he felt it was hard to gulp. There he saw Ashley, leaning back on one of the shelves with something on her hands. 

""Ashley? Are you okay?"" Josh startled whatever she was doing. 

She looks _flustered and sweating._ She pulled down her skirt and tried to fix her hair and clothes. But it was too late. Josh already had a hint on what she was doing. 

_Is she?_ Josh thought. _No way. Probably not. She looks innocent and ---_

Josh stared blankly on Ashley's hands. He saw an **8 inch dildo, a phone stand and a mask.** No one needed to say a thing to understand what's happening. 

Buckets of cold sweat run down on his face. He never imagined the 'innocent girl' she's been working with was working on something he never imagined, something for adults find too explicit. 

""Josh. Let me explain.""

Ashley tried to grab his hands but Josh moved back. Her hands were all wet from her juice, the toy dripping with it. Ashley looked flustered and doesn't know what to do. She tried to cover herself and picked up her items and tried to leave.

""Wait."" Josh didn't hesitate. He grabbed her hand where the dildo was being held hostage. ""Are you making contents?""

Ashley didn't look back and just nodded. ""I needed some extra cash. I don't have any choice. I needed this job. So please Josh, don't tell anybody."" She faced him while her top was unbuttoned down to two, revealing her deep cleavage under a laced red undergarment. 

_Damn. She looks so hot in that red bra. I never thought she looked so hot._

Josh, as he swallowed hard, gave a preposition to Ashley. ""Sure, I won't be telling anyone. But I have a suggestion.""

""What is it?"" Ashley buttoned her top and pulled down her skirt. As she tried to fix herself, Josh looked at her with deep gaze and warm thoughts rushed in his mind. 

""You might not need to bring that anymore"". Josh pointed at the 8 inch toy. Ashley, confused, looked at him with a blank expression. ""Why?""

Josh bravely unhook his belt. Ashley blushed hard and covered her face.

""W-wait! What are you doing?!"" She keeps on covering her while trying to face away from Josh. ""What? Should I tell the HR what you're doing here?"" 

Ashley bit her lip and faced him. She's shocked. It's as big as her toy, with little veins going over and under. Pulsating. Throbbing. 

""What are you waiting for? Get your camera rolling and use me as your toy.""

AITA for not letting my brother’s fiancée wear my mom’s wedding dress?

So, some context: I (28F) lost my mom six years ago to cancer. She and I were super close, and before she passed, she gave me her wedding dress and told me she hoped I’d wear it one day. It’s very sentimental to me. I keep it preserved in a special garment bag in my closet.

My younger brother (25M) recently got engaged to his girlfriend, Emily (24F). She’s sweet and we get along pretty well. A few weeks ago, she came over for coffee, and while we were talking about her wedding plans, she casually mentioned how beautiful my mom’s dress was. I agreed, and she suddenly asked if she could wear it for her wedding “as a way to honor her memory.”

I was taken aback. I told her that while I appreciated the thought, I wasn’t comfortable lending it out, and I planned on wearing it myself someday. She seemed a little surprised but didn’t say much.

Later that night, I got a call from my brother. He said Emily was hurt and felt like I was being possessive and that I could “just get it altered again” after she wore it.He also said that he want to “honor our mom as well.” Which js total bull because he can honor her in a way special to him! I stood my ground, saying it’s not about logistics—it’s deeply personal to me.

Now a few family members are chiming in, saying I’m being selfish and that “it’s just a dress” and I should be happy someone wants to honor Mom that way. My dad is on my side, but it’s become a bit of a family mess.

Hello all! So I've been watching Charlotte's wonderfully entertaining videos for about a year or so (some of my favorite things to watch while I get ready for work every day), but I still don't know why her fanbase is referred to as potatoes. But I do love potatoes, so I'm all about it! But if someone could tell me why that is, that'd be great, lol.

Let me dive right in. First, Context. Before the holiday's this past year, a girl I used to work with asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding. I thought this a little odd, because I had only hung out with her twice before she asked me, but she said that all the other people in the wedding party were her fiancé's family and maybe a few from her family. Basically, it was presented to me that she didn't have a lot of people that were JUST hers, or had any friends outside of either side's family, so I agreed.

Although we didn't have much in common or commonalities to really talk about, outside of our relationships anyway, I thought she was a sweet girl, and I felt for her. All of my closest friends (where I would have been a part of the wedding party) got married at the courthouse or had a small ceremony with no wedding party, so I had never been a part of a wedding party before. I figured it could be fun experience to do it at least once, and again, I felt for her when she said she didn't really have any friends.

Fast forward a little to January of this year and it's time to go try on bridesmaid dresses. She picked me up so we could ride together and get something to eat after. On the way there we saw a car drive by going the opposite direction and she says "" Oh my Gawd, that was Tommy! (fake name of course)"" I didn't think much of it but said something like ""Was it? Oh, that's cool,"" and we kept driving towards the bridal shop. As we're driving we're making small talk and I ask if she still had contact with Tommy since she stopped working where I did, and she says that she does, they're friends, and they'll hang out sometimes. I asked her if her fiancé knew and was cool with it. She said he did, and he is, because they trust each other. I was like oh that's cool, sound like you have a pretty solid relationship, and left it at that.

I should mention, as it's relevant, I don't work with Tommy, but his job brings him to mine on a regular basis, so we got to know each other a little bit over the past year and a half or so. We were always friendly and had a good rapport, and I'm ngl, I always thought he was cute. Anyway, about a year prior to this bridesmaid dress shopping trip, she had told me that I should ""talk"" to Tommy, that he's single, and thought we'd get along well and all that, but I was seeing someone else at the time.

Back to the trip to the bridal shop and after she said she saw Tommy drive past us, she mentioned again that him and I should ""talk"". At this time I was single, and just kind of shrugged in a ""maybe"" type way.

I'm super ADHD, so forgive me if this story jumps around a bit, lol but ANYWAY, after she says that she tells me that one of her best friends was going to be meeting us at the shop, so she could try on her bridesmaid dress as well. I didn't think much of it, but I did have a brief moment of confusion, since I was under the impression I was the only one outside of family to be a part of the wedding party, which is why she asked me in the first place. But whatever, no biggie, moving onward!

I try on a couple bridesmaid dresses, and put half down on the dress, about $200. Afterwards we go to a restaurant, get something to eat, and she takes me home. All-in-all, seemed like a good day.

The next day at work, I see Tommy and I tell him about how bride-to-be and I thought we saw him while we were out and about. He asked what part of town, I told him, but he said it wasn't him because he was on a different side of town. We're making small talk and he asks what we were doing so I tell him I'm one of her bridesmaids and she picked me up to go try on dresses.

Let me tell you, this man was so confused. He told me that he had no idea the bride-to-be was getting married and that she actually asked him for his number a couple months before and has been trying to hang out with him. Not only that, but apparently he met her for coffee just an hour before she picked me up the day before. She never even mentioned it to me, which seemed weird since she perked up when she thought she saw him drive past us.

The thing you need to know about Tommy, he's a nice guy. Like really nice. Not a pushover or anything like that, but he doesn't always know how to say ""no"" to people. He's not one to take crap from anyone by any means, and trust me when I say he can handle himself (he's SUPER fit btw) but he does whatever he can to avoid hurting someone's feelings, especially women. Honestly, he's just a real gentleman type of guy.

Anyway, he tells me that she asked for his number and he felt put on the spot, so he gave it to her. He said she would text him every now and then and he wouldn't always respond, but if he did it would be a short and close-ended response. I've seen all the messages too, so I can confirm this to be true. She would ask him to meet up, but after declining or saying he was busy a few times, he would relent and meet up for a quick coffee. They met up TWICE, both times for coffee, never more than 30 minutes, and again, this second time was right before she picked me up. Then he tells me that around New Years, she text him, unsent it, and then sent another the next day saying that it wasn't a drunk text, she meant what she said (although it said she unsent it), that she REALLY likes him and that she can't stop thinking about him... I was surprised, to say the least.

I had some downtime at work, so Tommy and I chatted about it for a bit, both of us just flabbergasted, and he asked if I'd like a screenshot of the text. I said sure, and we exchanged numbers.

We start texting each other about it, but we also started talking about other things as well. Immediately we start texting each other A LOT. There hasn't been a day since that that we haven't texted each other. We pretty quickly realize that we have a lot in common, and our texts and conversations were just effortless. We start hanging out, going out and about or just hanging out at my house. We became friends pretty quickly, both of us acknowledging that we have a pretty strong connection, and then about a month ago he became my boyfriend. We've already met each other's friends and family, with everyone being very welcoming and happy for us. Just good vibes all around, which I think is a first for the both of us.

Now back in January, only a week after him and I exchange numbers and begin talking, the bride-to-be hits me up and asks if I'd like to come shopping with her. I didn't really want to after seeing what she text Tommy while already engaged to her fiancé (I've never been in a relationship where I wasn't cheated on, or used to cheat with, so anything in the cheating arena is a sore spot for me), but Tommy and I figured it would be a good opportunity to dig a little deeper on the whole thing. We maybe she would at least address it or something. But that was wishful thinking. While her and I are out, he's continuously texting me, and she asks who I'm talking to. She seemed to be a little surprised when I said Tommy, but I couldn't sense anything else outside of her surprise.

As he continues to blow up my phone (intentionally since we wanted to see if she'd comment on it) she starts asking me if that was Tommy and started saying things like ""There's Tommy again."" Whenever she'd make a comment like that, I would just shrug and smile or give her a little mmhmm! Eventually she says, repeatedly, that he MUST like me. I ask why she thinks that and her response is, ""Well, he NEVER texts me like that."" I just say ""But why would he, you're engaged."" She left it alone after that.

There have been a few instances since then where she would ask if we were still talking, ask about him, or I would name drop Tommy to see if she would say anything, but she never did. She asked if I wanted to bring him as my plus one, but as more time passed, the more uncomfortable I became, especially since she would ask if I'd wanna come hang out with her and her fiancé, and she still never addressed anything. And I don't know for sure, but I feel like she has to know that he told or showed me what she text him.

Tommy did say he would go with me as my plus one, but if he was honest he'd feel a bit uncomfortable attending. Like me, he also hates anything in that could be perceived as cheating or cheating adjacent behavior. And although he never had any interest in her (she's also a lot younger than us - I'm 35, he's 39 and she's 24), it was the fact that she was engaged while pursuing him that makes him uncomfortable. So, understandably, he doesn't want to attend but said he would for me so I wouldn't have to go alone.

A few days ago, we talked to my mom about it as well to see if I was overreacting or if I was justified in wanting to pull out, and both her and my stepdad agreed with Tommy that I should. Fortunately, bride-to-be responded well (part of me thinks she knows why I did and maybe expected it), but I still can't help but feel like I'm blowing this out of proportion. There was no physical cheating, but it was still shady enough to give me pause. I just don't think that someone engaged to be married should be telling other guys they  can't stop thinking about them, while also trying to push that same guy on a ""friend"" (i.e., me).

I would just like to get some outside and impartial perspective here, to ease my anxiety driven and overthinking mind. So, AITA or OR at all by pulling out of this wedding?

  
Edit to add: I feel like I should also mention that Tommy isn't the only guy she's texted like this. There's another guy, one of my direct co-workers, that she was also texting around that time, inviting him out for drinks and he definitely felt like she was trying to flirt with him. She would even randomly bring him coffee or food to work on her days off. I don't know if this info helps, but could add a little more context.  ",8,1744682237.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,7,1.0,False

Then 1.5 years later, she told me she wanted to go to that place doing the same job again, this time for a 6 month rotation. I told her I was not ready for that and it would ruin all the work we just did. She went anyways.

When she returned again, I told her I want to separate for a while, despite her objections. Shortly after, I met someone and dated them for a few months. I actually fell in love with this person, but she lived 4 hours away, and in the end, I decided I couldn't do long distance while still living in our family home...

Fast forward a year, things with the wife are OK. I would say Im content as opposed to happy. I will say the wife had put a lot of work into saving the marriage and self counciling since then. Last week, I ran into the new girl and we ended up having coffee. She said she still thinks of me and would drop everything for another chance.

Since then, she is all I can think about. I really fell hard for her... Should I leave my marriage for her? 

TL;DR I feel like my heart and soul would be happy, but I would lose everything in the process, my home, my savings, my kids would probably hate me.... What should I do???",15,1744682092.0,relationships,39,0.7,False

How do extroverts survive in grad school and academia generally? I learn and remember 100 times more if I'm working on a research problem *with* somebody. Even when I'm not working, I'd rather be watching TV or listening to a podcast with company. (Or just chatting.) 

The problem isn’t my department. I like them all, and by any normal standard for academia, we’re thriving socially. We go out to dinner after seminars, go to the gym together, grab coffee... Everyone has been really welcoming and I feel really lucky and valued. And that’s so rare in academia! I’ve hit the jackpot really. But that’s *still* not enough for me. Honestly, typing it out I feel ungrateful. 

Does anyone else feel the same way? How do you cope?

1jzg5i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jzg5i6/ive_been_stuck_driving_in_an_endless_highway/,I’ve been stuck driving in an endless highway tunnel for 10 hours,"Somehow I found a spot in the tunnel with enough service to, hopefully, get this post out. I’m holding on to this singular bar for dear life. 

My situation is growing dire; I’m running out of gas, which also means I won’t be able to charge my phone. The only food I have is a bag of Sour Patch Kids, a box of Cheez-its, 2 Red Bulls and about a half gallon of water.  

Let me explain what’s going on. 

I’m a traveler, always have been. I’m used to cross-country road trips (I’m located in the United States), driving for hours, through the night, without stopping — except to use the restroom or grab a quick meal.

I’m currently making the trek from Los Angeles to Chicago. I’ve done this trip before, but I took Route 66 that time, for the hell of it. This time, I opted to take the interstates, a shorter ride and a way I haven’t taken before. This way cuts through the middle of the country, passing through Colorado and Nebraska and Iowa. 

The drive was going normal. Lots of nothingness — I’m used to going hours without seeing any other cars, or people, when I’m driving out here. 

By the time I’m writing this, I’ve been driving for close to 3 days. Last night I slept in a Walmart parking lot somewhere in Colorado, I think Frisco? I drove for over 14 hours straight yesterday, only stopping a couple of times at gas stations to grab snacks, take a piss, and refuel. I grabbed dinner at a Taco Bell at like midnight before I crashed. 

I’m recounting every detail because I’m hoping that, maybe, this whole thing could be explained away by a lack of sleep and nutrition. I know I should be eating and sleeping more, but I just don’t think about it when I’m on the road. I don’t think about anything. That’s why I love these trips so much. 

Anyways, I woke up this morning at the crack of dawn (like 6 a.m. in Colorado, which is 5 a.m. my time) and continued on my way. I wanted to make good time — not for any reason, it’s not like I had plans, I just wanted to see how quickly I could drive so far. 

I grabbed breakfast at a local cafe (a bagel and a coffee), filled up on gas, grabbed some Red Bulls, some beef jerky, and a gallon of water. Then I headed out. 

I don’t think I stopped driving until like 6 hours in, when I realized I was gonna piss myself from all the energy drinks I chugged (I tend to space out until it’s nearly too late). I stopped at the first gas station I saw — 2 measly gas pumps and a run-down, old wooden shack for a convenience store. I was somewhere coming up on Kearney, Nebraska and I had endured another time change, so it was now around 2 p.m.

I walked inside and the bell on the door jingled. The man at the cash register jumped — startled by the first sign of life other than his own cigarette-soaked breaths. 

I asked him if they had a restroom and he grinned. “There’s a bucket out back, Princess.” He said, stifling a chuckle. 

I stared at him blankly, waiting for a punchline. He sighed and handed me a tarnished key attached to a piece of wood, which had been roughly etched with “PISSER.” 

He pointed to a door at the far end of the shack. I did my business — though the toilet looked like it hadn’t been cleaned since before I was born — and returned the key to the man at the register, who I now noticed had a name tag that read “GUS.”

I turned to leave, but before I could, Gus cleared his throat and asked me, “Where ya headed?” I told him Chicago, and he said, “What for?” I told him I didn’t really know. “Just to go, I guess.”

His eyes lingered on me a moment, almost an uncomfortable amount of time. Then, he quickly glanced about the shack before he said, “Well, if you can spare a couple hours, I know of a bitchin’ scenic route through the peaks a bit further north.”

He went on to tell me that this route was only really known to locals, winding through Nebraskan peaks with plenty of lookouts over… whatever the hell is in Nebraska. Historically home to booze-filled high school parties, romantic illegal camping rendezvous, and, of course, it’s fair share of local folklore legends, like the classic, “teen lovers murdered during a make-out sesh and the killer was never caught,” type shit. 

It’s not like his story really piqued my interest; it’s the same shit you hear about every random “scenic route” and “lookout” in every random small town. But that’s exactly why I chose to embark upon Gus’ route. 

I’m always so curious to explore the places that locals know and adore in all of the random small towns I wind up in along my travels. It makes me realize how connected we really are — no matter where we are in the world, we live out these parallel lives. Experiencing emotions and struggles that so many other people also experience, in their own ways. I love finding these spots. I love feeling connected with something, anything. 

He gave me crude directions, but it seemed simple enough. Continue up Interstate 80 for an hour or two longer until I see a turnoff, a dirt road to my left, “Can’t miss it.” that’ll take me where I “need to go,” according to Gus. 

I figured that if I didn’t see the turnoff, I’d just take the loss. 

After our conversation, I decided to purchase some snacks (Sour Patch Kids, Cheez-its, and 2 more Red Bulls) and a pack of menthol cigarettes. I filled up on gas again before leaving — I wasn’t sure when the next gas station would be, especially if I found Gus’ route — and I continued on my way. 

I lit a cigarette as I began this next leg of my journey. My mother would kill me for smoking in my car. She’d kill me for a lot of the shit I do when I take these trips. 

One thing I started to learn is that Nebraska is full of corn and wheat. In all directions, all I could see were miles and miles of farmland, stalks waving in the wind like a sorry excuse for an ocean. 

Interstate 80 was surrounded, crops creeping onto the shoulders of the road, refusing to adhere to man-made perimeters. The stalks grew high above my SUV, making it so I could see nothing beyond the confines of my wheaty, corny prison. 

I had been driving for about two hours since the gas station when I saw it — a break in the crops to my left. Gus was right, I couldn’t miss it. The dirt road stood out like a beacon: a sudden relief from my engulfment. 

I didn’t feel any hesitation to take the path. In fact, I was excited that I had actually stumbled across it. As I made the turn, I could almost feel the stories, the experiences of the people who had made this turn before me. 

Every local has their spots. In every big city, every small town, every single person has a place that is special to them. A coffee shop, a hiking trail, a park. Somewhere they have left pieces of themselves. I want to leave pieces of myself everywhere.

The dirt road cut through the fields, heading north. Far ahead of me, I could see a small range of peaks and hills — nothing compared to California’s mountain ranges, but at least it wasn’t flat, like everywhere else is out here. 

After driving through more and more miles of farmland, eventually I started to ascend. The road curved to my right at the base of the closest peak, turned from dirt into old, battered pavement, and I began a twisty-turny ride up and up. 

As I got higher up the peak, I could see what Gus was talking about — the views were incredible. Plots of farmland, a quilt that covered the Earth in greens and tans and yellows. I lit another cigarette and slowly continued my drive. 

I stopped at a couple of lookouts, just random turnoffs on the side of the road, taking in my surroundings. You can find beauty in anything if you try, even Nebraskan wheat fields. I felt like a local. 

The road was nothing special. Similar to most mountain roads I’ve taken before. Nothing stood out, really, besides some empty bottles and beer cans in the brush. I didn’t see a single other person for the entirety of my drive, which I enjoyed. It was just me and the woods and the road.

Then I entered the tunnel. 

I didn’t think anything of it. Plenty of mountain roads cut through portions of the mountain itself, causing you to drive through a manufactured hole in the rock. I used to play a game as a kid where I’d hold my breath until we made it through to the other side. I’m glad I didn’t try to hold my breath this time. 

I immediately noticed the tunnel was long. I couldn’t see any light coming from the other end. The dirty orange bulbs hanging from the ceiling every 10 feet or so didn’t make much of a difference in the pitch-black. 

I drove for about 30 mins, thinking to myself that this may be the longest tunnel I’ve ever driven through. Then the lights started diminishing. They began popping up every 30 feet. Then every 50 feet. Then every 100 feet. Then there were none. 

I drove through the darkness for another 45 minutes, my headlights leading the way. I’d been in the tunnel for over an hour now, it was close to 8 p.m., and I didn’t see any signs of the exit. 

I decided to turn around. I didn’t like being swallowed by darkness. The rock walls were closing in on me, reigniting my claustrophobic fears that consumed me as a child.

I drove for an hour or so back the direction I came. The lights should have started coming back by now — but they didn’t. No orange bulbs.

I drove for another hour. and another. Almost 3 hours driving back the way I came, and I never made it back to the tunnel’s entrance. I was never greeted by the warm glow of the dim bulbs. 

Maybe the lights had gone out? But even then, I should have been out of the tunnel hours ago by now. I started getting worried. 

I was confused. I *had* turned around, hadn’t I? I remembered taking that 3-point U-turn in the narrow tunnel; I had been worried my SUV wouldn’t even be able to make the turn, and was relieved when it had.

I grabbed my phone but of course, no service. And who would I even call? My angry mother, who would just chew me out for listening to a strange man at a gas station in the first place? I have no friends back home, I’m more inclined to spend my time alone. No relationships, besides an ex who wants me dead. I’ve only had myself for as long as I can remember. 

I left on this trip without telling anyone I was leaving, let alone where I’d be. Would anyone even notice I was lost? My mind was racing, looking for a solution as I kept driving. 

Luckily my car is good on gas. I was still at half a tank. I just kept going — what else was I supposed to do?

After another 2 hours, I was desperate. My gas wouldn’t last forever, it was dwindling fast, and when my car gave out I wouldn’t be able to charge my phone, either. My only distraction from the void enveloping me was my downloaded Spotify playlists. I needed that to survive. I needed that so I didn’t go crazy in here.

Out of nowhere, while I was fiddling with my music, I saw a beacon of hope. One single bar; it popped up for a split second. I slammed on my brakes and reversed until I got to the sweet spot. 

At this point, I didn’t care if my mother screamed at me so loud it damaged my phone’s speaker. I needed to tell someone what was happening to me. 

I hovered over her contact for a few seconds before I sighed and clicked “call.” It didn’t even ring. Just a horrific beeping that signified no service. 

I rested my forehead on the steering wheel, tears starting to well. I wasn’t going to get stuck out here. I couldn’t. My brain wouldn’t even consider that an option. 

I grabbed my phone and got out of the car. An eerie whistling from the wind blowing through the tunnel filled my ears. I climbed on top of my car. Maybe if I stood up here, I could get a call out. 

It didn’t work. The same disheartening beeping rang out over and over, and I groaned. I could feel the anxiety building, my heart pounding against my chest. 

Then, I heard something. It was faint at first, like someone trying to stifle a cough. I thought I imagined it. I stood there, listening. 

Then it happened again, louder. It sounded like a playful shout, like maybe a teenager exploring the tunnel, hooting and hollering with their friends. This is what my mind latched on to; another sign of life meant I could get out of here.

I shouted back, “HEY!” 

It echoed, bouncing off the cold rock walls, repeating over and over. 

Then, it was uncannily quiet. The wind’s whistling stopped and everything went still. All I could hear were my own panicked breaths. 

Then, footsteps. Hundreds of them. 

Running, thumping footsteps, coming from both directions. It shook the ground and made my car wobble. Pebbles tumbled off the walls.

I have never felt so weak, so exposed. I damn near broke a bone jumping off of the roof of my car and stumbling into my driver’s seat at what felt like the speed of light. I slammed the car door and locked it. I laid my seat all the way back and pressed myself against it, wanting so badly to dissolve, to disappear. 

My car stopped swaying. The quiet returned. 

I laid there for what must have been an hour, maybe more. Tears caked my face and I couldn’t stop shaking. I tried every breathing exercise my therapist had taught me. Nothing could calm me. 

What the actual fuck was that?

I haven’t moved. I’m still laying in my driver’s seat, typing this. It’s almost 4 a.m. I have been in this tunnel for almost 10 hours. I thought that maybe if I sat down and wrote out everything that’s happened so far, it would help me understand. I still don’t understand, but it is helping me to settle down. It’s grounding me in my reality. 

Can someone please figure out where I am? Can someone tell me what’s happening?

How does a tunnel suddenly extend by miles? Did Gus know about this? Is that why he sent me here? I’m paranoid.

What do I do from here? I don’t want to get out of my car again. What if they find me? Why did they stop running to me? Did I imagine it, in my hungry, exhausted state?

I don’t think continuing to drive is a good option, but it’s really the only option. Eventually my gas is going to run out. Eventually my phone is going to die for good. Eventually, I will starve or die of dehydration. I’m conserving the little food and drink I have as much as I can. 

I’m freaking out. I’m so thankful I bought these cigarettes. 

If anyone has any idea how I can get out of this, please tell me. I’ll try anything. 

If anything else happens in here, I’ll keep you updated. I pray to God this posts.",23,1744681826.0,nosleep,8,1.0,False

I am a 25 y/o that has been homeschooled since birth and have been struggling to figure out why i feel messed up in some way, i’ve spent hours analyzing my childhood and comparing it to others who had better or worse ones, trying to figure out what went wrong, i have never been subjected to abuse or neglect (from what i can tell), i’ve never been yelled at, never been grounded, bad behavior was just a stern talking to, (again, never raised their voice though), i was a pretty good quiet obedient kid i think, i recall having a relatively happy childhood, until adolescence hit so maybe 12-14, is when i first felt signs of depression? Also my anxious thoughts worsened, i feel like i’ve always been socially anxious longer than i’ve felt depressed, i can recall being deathly afraid of attending a relative’s wedding and crying and shaking, although if it was out of fear or the place just being really cold or both? I’ll never know, (i was maybe between the ages of 5-8), and i hated doing the piano recitals i was made to do in my teens, aside from those few negative experiences, thats the extent of the “stress” i had to deal with growing up (note: i’ve never been taken to a professional for mental problems or anything this is all speculation on my part)



years later, I have JUST come to realize that while i didn’t have a bad childhood so to speak, it was somewhat isolating, because of homeschooling, my only friends were my family, as for interaction outside of family, i faintly recall a brief interaction with another toddler my age at the time, and then another brief one-off interaction with a family friend’s kid when i was a little older whom i never saw again, any other times playing with kids around my age was with cousins during visits, which didn’t last long either, when i wasn’t doing schoolwork, i was watching TV, playing computer games/video games, drawing, reading, talking to myself and making up stories/characters in my head (so not much different from what i do today…), fun times but i found myself fantasizing what it’d be like to be apart of the trios of friends id see on the disney channel shows, cartoons or the movies, getting into misadventures together or something less dramatic like “normal stuff” like in a slice-of-life anime, what’s it like getting a cup of coffee with a non-family friend? sitting in a parking lot in the car at night and losing hours just chatting with your best friend? going on a date? (not that i care about dating stuff), even just going on leisurely walks by myself, eating out by myself or going anywhere by myself? i should probably mention how scared i am of being by myself outside, it was worse growing up but approaching adulthood i could comfortably step outside my door and walk around abit without having anxious thoughts of being hurt by someone, it doesn’t help that my family constantly reminds me how dangerous the world is, even if i wanted to take a walk far away from my house by myself, they wouldn’t allow me to, yes, even though im an adult…



Is it bad that im an adult and i have no job, cannot drive, my family has to drive me places, and still go in stores with me? so i’ve never been by myself except for ONE TIME i was separated from them for 4+ hours because of jury duty, but anyways, homeschool seems to be the only thing that caused me to become this depressed parasite to society who doesn’t wanna do anything but hide away in their bed, having suicidal ideation yet feels like crying on a daily basis because they’re so afraid they’re gonna die somehow, because i have an irrational fear of my own mortality and BASICALLY EVERYTHING that COULD hurt me especially other people so sorry i had to burden any reader with my life story but i had to get this off my chest, i guess the last thing i will say is…was it my fault? Why did my family do this to me? But i know it’s because they just loved me too much to even entertain the slightest possibility that i could get wronged, kidnapped or worse if they slackened their grip on the metaphorical leash they have on me, i know they’re scared too, how can i be angry at that? I dont want to hate the people that feed me, clothe me, provide a roof over my head and have never hurt me, i just wish they didn’t make me feel like a HUMAN PET and despite them treating me like a kid still, im an adult who can’t blame them for my problems anymore….in present day im really struggling to get my GED because im too depressed to study even though i have one last test to complete which is the math one, my worst subject, without a GED i can’t get a job that will pay enough to help me be totally independent, my family wouldn’t want me doing back-breaking labour anyways, even if i had a job tomorrow, im too afraid of people to show up, i kinda feel like my life is over and i screwed myself over, the only thing keeping me alive is the one or two online friends i have and waiting for the season of my favorite show or new video game to come out, as sad as that sounds…um, ok im rambling too much, bye :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding Your Septic Tank System

Septic tanks play a crucial role in managing household wastewater when you're not connected to a municipal sewer system. Knowing how to maintain a septic tank to avoid backups is essential for protecting your property and ensuring smooth operation. A septic system typically consists of a tank that holds wastewater long enough for solids to settle at the bottom, forming sludge, while oil and grease float to the top as scum. The clearer liquid in the middle, called effluent, exits the tank to the drain field. Proper maintenance helps prevent solids from overflowing into the drain field, avoiding clogs and backups.

### Regular Inspection and Pumping

One of the most important steps in how to maintain a septic tank to avoid backups is regular inspection and pumping. Most tanks require pumping every 3 to 5 years, depending on tank size and household use. Regular inspections by a professional can identify potential issues before they become costly problems. Over time, sludge and scum layers build up, reducing the tank’s capacity and risking overflow. Skipping this crucial step increases the chance of backups, unpleasant odors, and ground contamination.

### Monitoring Water Usage

Your household’s water consumption directly affects the septic system’s efficiency. Excessive water use can overload the tank and drain field, leading to backups. Practice water-saving habits such as fixing leaks, installing low-flow faucets and toilets, and spreading out laundry loads throughout the week. By using water wisely, you help your septic tank function optimally and reduce the risk of costly repairs.

### Mindful Disposal Habits

What you flush or pour down the drain greatly impacts your septic tank's health. Avoid flushing non-biodegradable items such as wipes, feminine hygiene products, paper towels, and dental floss, as these can clog your system. Harsh chemicals, like paint thinners, antifreeze, and strong disinfectants, can kill beneficial bacteria in the tank that break down waste naturally. Maintain a balanced bacterial environment by disposing of these substances properly and using septic-safe cleaning products. This careful approach prevents blockages and safeguards the tank’s biological processes.

### Protecting the Drain Field

The drain field, or leach field, is where the effluent from the septic tank disperses into the soil for natural filtration. Protecting this area is vital in how to maintain a septic tank to avoid backups. Never park or drive vehicles over your drain field, and avoid planting trees or shrubs nearby with invasive roots that can damage pipes. Also, direct roof drains, sump pumps, and surface water away from the drain field to prevent oversaturation. A compromised drain field won’t absorb wastewater effectively, causing backups in the system.

### Addressing Minor Issues Promptly

Early detection is key to avoiding septic tank backups. Pay attention to signs of trouble like slow drains, unusual odors near your septic tank or drain field, wet spots or pooling water, and gurgling sounds in the plumbing. If you notice any of these, contact a septic professional immediately. Timely repairs can stop a small problem from turning into a costly mess and keep your system running smoothly.

### Using Additives with Caution

Some homeowners turn to chemical additives claiming to clean or improve septic tanks. However, many of these products can harm the bacterial balance essential for waste breakdown or damage system components. Before using any additive, consult a septic expert. Natural solutions and regular mechanical pumping are generally more effective and safe for maintaining septic system health.

### Keeping Records and Following Local Guidelines

Maintain thorough records of septic service dates, inspections, and any repairs or alterations. This information helps track the system’s condition over time and assists professionals when servicing your tank. Additionally, familiarize yourself with local regulations regarding septic system maintenance and disposal rules, as they can vary and influence how you should care for your system.

### Summary Checklist for Effective Septic Tank Maintenance

- Schedule professional inspections every 1 to 3 years depending on usage.
- Pump out the tank every 3 to 5 years to remove sludge and scum.
- Conserve water and spread out heavy usage.
- Avoid flushing or pouring harmful substances down drains.
- Protect the drain field from heavy traffic and root intrusion.
- Watch for early warning signs like slow drains and odors.
- Consult professionals before using any septic additives.
- Keep detailed maintenance records and follow local regulations.

By following these essential practices on how to maintain a septic tank to avoid backups, you ensure your system operates efficiently and lasts for many years. Regular care prevents unpleasant backups, costly repairs, and environmental hazards, saving you time and money in the long run.

### Neglecting Regular Inspections and Pumping

One of the biggest causes of septic system failure is neglecting routine maintenance. Most homeowners tend to forget or delay regular inspections and tank pumping. Over time, solids accumulate, and when the tank becomes too full, untreated waste flows into the drain field, causing blockages or system overload.

To prevent backups, it's important to have your septic tank inspected every 3 years and pumped every 3 to 5 years, depending on system size and household usage. Regular maintenance removes the build-up of sludge and scum, keeping the system healthy and efficient.

### Using Harsh Chemicals and Excessive Water

Certain household products and habits can damage your septic system. Harsh chemicals such as bleach, drain cleaners, and antibacterial soaps kill the beneficial bacteria that break down waste in the tank. Without these bacteria, solids build up quickly, leading to clogs and system failure.

Additionally, overloading your system with water from frequent laundry loads or long showers can flood the drain field. Excessive water doesn’t allow for proper soil absorption, increasing the risk of backups and drain field damage.

### Flushing Inappropriate Items

Many septic system problems start when people flush items that shouldn’t enter the system. Flushing non-biodegradable objects or substances like wipes, feminine hygiene products, grease, coffee grounds, and even paper towels can clog pipes and fill the tank prematurely.

Stick to flushing only human waste and toilet paper designed to dissolve easily. This simple habit significantly reduces the risk of blockages, keeping your septic system flowing smoothly.

### Ignoring Landscape and Drain Field Care

Proper care around the septic system’s drain field is essential. Planting trees or shrubs too close to the drain field can cause roots to invade and damage pipes. Parking vehicles or building structures above the drain field compacts the soil, reducing its ability to absorb and filter wastewater effectively.

Maintain grass or shallow-rooted plants over the drain field instead, and avoid heavy foot traffic or construction activities near this sensitive area.

### Poor Placement of Garbage Disposals and Water Softeners

Garbage disposals increase the amount of solid waste entering your septic tank, putting extra strain on the system. This leads to faster sludge accumulation, meaning more frequent pumping is needed than with normal use.

Water softeners that discharge salty water into the septic system may harm the bacteria crucial for breaking down waste. Check with a septic professional to understand how installing these appliances could affect your system and find alternative solutions if necessary.

### Investing in Professional Maintenance and Education

To avoid costly septic failures, it’s wise to partner with a septic service professional who can provide timely inspections, pumping, and system advice. Professionals can identify potential issues early, recommend practices tailored to your home’s unique system, and ensure everything is compliant with local regulations.

Educational resources about septic tank care also empower homeowners. Knowing what to flush, what chemicals to avoid, and how to manage water usage can extend the life of your system and keep backups at bay.

### Signs that Your Septic System Needs Attention

- **Slow draining fixtures:** Toilets, sinks, or showers draining slowly often indicate a blockage or a full tank.
- **Unpleasant odors:** Bad smells around the tank, drain field, or plumbing vents can signify leaks or backups.
- **Pooling water on the drain field:** Excess water surfacing above the soil means the system isn’t absorbing properly.
- **Algal growth in nearby water bodies:** Runoff from septic failures can cause algae surges, impacting local water quality.

If you notice any of these warning signs, act promptly and contact a septic professional to diagnose and resolve the problem before it worsens.

### Maintaining a Septic-Safe Lifestyle

Your daily habits strongly influence the health of your septic system. Here are a few tips to keep your septic tank working well and to prevent backups:

Click Here For No More Tank Trouble: https://app.leadcreator.ai/xjfnw3cfz8  
  
- Conserve water: Fix leaks and spread out laundry loads to avoid overwhelming the system.
- Be cautious with cleaning products: Use septic-safe detergents and avoid strong chemicals.
- Dispose of grease and oils properly: Never pour them down the drain.
- Use toilet-friendly wipes sparingly, or better yet, avoid them.

Keeping your septic tank well-maintained avoids backups and costly repairs, protecting your home and the environment.

### Conclusion

Keeping your septic tank well-maintained is key to preventing backups and costly repairs. By following essential steps like scheduling regular pump-outs, conserving water, and being mindful of what goes down your drains, you can greatly extend the life of your system. Remember that avoiding common mistakes—such as flushing harmful chemicals, pouring grease down the sink, or planting trees too close to the tank—plays a big role in keeping your septic system flowing smoothly.

Taking these simple yet important actions protects both your home and the environment. When you treat your septic tank with care, you reduce the risk of clogs, leaks, and unpleasant backups that disrupt daily life. Plus, being proactive saves money by preventing emergency fixes and major damage.

After messaging on instagram a bit and talking at the coffee shop, we eventually hung out one on one a few times. I thought they might be dates but wasn’t sure. This was in October and then I got super busy and got worse and worse at responding to his texts. Then I was traveling for Thanksgiving and Christmas and everything was so hectic. I was dealing with some issues with my mom who has a bit of a drinking problem and I couldn’t get my Vyvanse prescription filled, so as you can imagined everything snowballed. My life felt like an avalanche that I was trying to outrun. I was so focused on getting through it (and felt so bad for not responding) that I didn’t reply until January. He responded and I only saw the first bit of the message—“I’m so glad that you’re taking time for yourself”—before the shame of not responding consumed me again and I put it off until last weekend. 

I finally broke down and asked a friend to help me respond because I was feeling so bad about it. She read his response to me and it was actually much more negative than I thought it was. He said that I had actually caused him a lot of anxiety by not responding, that he was afraid he had crossed a line, and that he actually didn’t think he could hang out with me again for awhile because I had hurt him so much. I felt awful, absolutely dreadful. My friend helped me respond and say that I was sorry, that he didn’t do anything wrong, and that I just genuinely got caught up in other stuff.

Well, he hasn’t responded since Saturday, I haven’t been back to the coffee shop in months, and it feels like I’ve destroyed these relationships.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern glass coffee table​ market offers a diverse array of options, each⁢ with its unique features and specifications. Understanding these details is crucial in selecting a table that perfectly fits your needs and design preferences.

**Glass Type and Thickness:** ⁢The type of glass used in a coffee table significantly impacts its durability and safety. Most ⁢high-quality glass coffee tables feature tempered ​glass, which is much stronger and more ⁣resistant to breakage than ‌regular glass. Tempered glass is also designed to⁢ shatter into small, relatively harmless pieces, minimizing ​the risk of injury. Thickness typically ranges from 8mm to​ 12mm or more, with thicker glass offering greater strength and stability.

It's important⁤ to check for certifications or safety standards to ensure the glass used is ⁢of high quality and meets safety⁢ requirements. Thicker glass is ⁢generally preferable, especially in households with children or pets, as it provides added peace of mind.

**Frame Material and Construction:** The frame of a glass coffee table provides structural support​ and contributes to⁢ its overall style. Common frame materials include stainless steel, wood, and metal alloys. Stainless steel frames offer a modern, industrial look and are highly resistant to rust and corrosion.Wood frames provide warmth and character, blending well ‌with traditional ‌or rustic décor. Metal ​alloy frames offer a balance of strength and affordability, allowing for a⁢ variety of finishes and designs.

Pay attention ⁤to the construction quality of the⁤ frame, ensuring that joints are securely fastened and that the frame is stable and level. Look for features like adjustable feet to compensate ⁤for uneven floors and prevent ​wobbling.

**Shape and Size:**‍ Glass coffee tables come in various shapes and sizes, including rectangular, square, round, oval, ​and freeform designs. The ideal shape and size will depend on the size and layout of ⁤your living room, and also your personal⁣ preferences. Rectangular coffee tables are a popular choice for larger spaces, providing ample surface area for drinks, snacks, and ⁣décor.⁢ Square coffee tables work well ⁣in‌ smaller, ‍more intimate settings, creating a balanced​ and symmetrical look.‍ Round or oval coffee tables are ideal⁣ for homes with children, as they eliminate sharp corners and promote a smoother flow of traffic.

Consider the dimensions of your sofa and other furniture when choosing a coffee table. A general rule ‍of thumb⁣ is that the coffee table should be approximately two-thirds the length of your sofa and should be positioned ⁢about 18 inches away from the sofa.

**Weight Capacity:** The weight capacity of a glass coffee table indicates how much weight ⁤it‌ can safely support. This is an critically important consideration, especially⁤ if you plan to place heavy items on the table,⁣ such as books, decorations, or trays filled⁤ with beverages. Look for tables with a specified weight capacity that ⁢meets your needs and be sure not to exceed this limit.

Manufacturers typically provide weight capacity facts ‍in the product​ specifications or on a label attached to the table. Choosing a table with‌ a higher weight ‍capacity‍ than you anticipate needing can provide added assurance and prevent accidents.

**Design Style and ⁢Aesthetics:** The design style of a ⁢glass coffee table should ⁣complement your existing décor and reflect your personal taste. Modern glass coffee tables come in a variety of​ styles, ⁤from minimalist and contemporary to ‍industrial and ⁢eclectic. Clear ​glass tops showcase the​ frame and allow light to pass through,creating an open and airy feel. Tinted or frosted glass can add a touch of sophistication and provide privacy.

Consider ⁣the overall color palette of your living room and choose a coffee table‍ that harmonizes with the existing furniture and accessories. Pay attention to details like the shape of the legs,the finish of⁤ the frame,and any decorative accents.

I was out running some errands for work, standing in a line. Two girls were behind me giggling. Typically this would actually cause me to close up and become anxious because my anxiety tells me that they're laughing at me. Confidence is one of my major issues, feel like this can apply to a lot of guys on this sub, not every dude but a lot of us. 

Dunno what it was about that day or time, or maybe it's because we were waiting in line and I had time to think about all of this. But the voice I finally needed to hear came through for me, ""Either you can retreat into yourself or go on the attack."" (""attack"" not being literal obviously). So I just started thinking about it, who I was, why I was there, my job, all the things that took me to get there. I wasn't hyping myself up to talk to those girls, just wanted to feel less ""squeezed"" in my own skin while waiting.

Anyhow, line is moving hella slowly so the other girl's friend decides to wonder around I guess? Iunno but she eventually left for a bit. I naturally keep on head on a swivel, so I was absently mindedly scanning the room when I looked over at her. First time actually getting a look at her and damn is she fine. Basically your ideal cutie alt-goth baddie. She was actually looking over at me and we locked eyes for a second, she actually smiled at me and let out one of those laugh/sighs. Again, dunno what it was about that exact instance but I actually smiled back instead of doing what I usually do and either look away or pretend to not notice if I see someone looking or smiling at me. 

As the line moved forward I sorta started positing my flank towards her, instead of my back fully turned towards her. Mixture of conscious and unconscious on my part. She eventually compliments my tie and correctly guesses what I do for work and we just sorta went from there. 

Honestly, my conversation skills at this point aren't too bad, I can hold a good conversation with most people. Still though, this was a very different context than before. I know this will be met with an eye-roll, but it really was confidence, but not in the way you think. I had to effectively rely on momentum in this instance, as in ""she and her friend were laughing checking you out, she smiled at you when you met her gaze, she started the conversation with you, there's reasons for her to be interested in you."" so I just kept going and she kept giving me positive indications which I just kept going off of. 

When it was finally my turn to go up and I run my brain for every piece of advice I've ever gotten on how to get a girl's number. I didn't do some of the more specific lines that my friends use but still. Don't directly ask her for her number because you're putting too much of the ball into her court and it just sounds kinda scummy, instead tell her that you liked chatting with her and want to do it again that way you've complimented her and decontextualized the question, leave it somewhat open to her in regards in what she's willing to give you in terms of contact info, soften the ask by adding something to it, etc.

Somehow, someway, she gave me her Instagram and followed me back then and there. We depart and a short while later she messages me asking about some of my photos on my Instagram and she actually has some of the same interest as me. Asked her if she wanted to meet for coffee the only time of the week I'm available and she agreed. 

To be clear, I'm not out of here yet, one coffee date isn't a marriage, but fuck man. Just sorta feels like its been 10 years worth of working on myself, heavy self-reflection on myself and the people around me and finally the picture is coming together. I remember turning 20 and asking myself ""Would you date you? No."" But gradually as time went on that started to change ""Would you date you? I mean, I'd give myself a shot."" and it's nice to know that wasn't delusion. 

If you're into Gunpla, you know when you first open the box, cutting the pieces, looking at the directions, you're thinking ""How tf is this suppose to eventually be a mobile suit?"" But as you put the pieces together, slowly it's starts coming together and then out of nowhere you're finished the build? That's how it felt, that ""Oh damn, that's how these pieces all come together.""

I Should’ve Ignored Them.,"Riley and I were bleeding out in the city, our lives scraped raw by endless hustle and a world that didn’t care. I’m 24, a marine biology student drowning in loans, my days split between lectures and diner shifts, my nights spent sketching starfish and corals I’d never touch, the ink smudging under my tired hands. Riley, 26, is a mechanic, his palms etched with oil, his laugh a flare in the dark, loud enough to drown out the sirens, though his wrench couldn’t fix our bank account, always red, always shrinking. We’d sprawl on our apartment’s sagging couch, the walls paper-thin, neighbors yelling, pipes groaning, dreaming of a place where we could hear our own thoughts. Riley would grin, his hazel eyes catching the streetlight, saying, “One day, man, we’ll ditch this cage, find a spot that’s ours.” I’d nod, my chest tight, wanting it so bad it hurt, but the city kept us chained, its noise a noose. When I scrolled through a job board one sleepless night, half-dead on coffee, and saw an ad for a caretaker gig at Blackthorn Isle’s lighthouse, it was a jolt, a crack of light in our gray. A year’s lodging in a cottage, a paycheck to keep an old beacon spinning, and solitude, pure, untouched, to rebuild what we’d lost. No deposit, no prying forms, just a phone call with an agent who sounded wrong, his voice clipped, shaky, like he was reading from a script he didn’t write. “You sure about this,” he asked, not waiting for an answer, hanging up fast, leaving static in my ear. We didn’t care, we were too hungry for escape, too worn to question. We stuffed our lives into duffels, Riley’s tools rattling, my books bending the straps, and caught a ferry that groaned across the North Atlantic, landing eight days ago on a shore sharp with rocks, the sea’s growl low, constant, like it was sizing us up. Riley stepped off first, his boots crunching, his grin wide, arm slung around me. “This is it, brother, our reset, you feel that air?” I breathed in, salt and cold stinging my lungs, and smiled, nodding, though something in the waves, their rhythm, felt off, like a pulse not ours.
Blackthorn Isle is no postcard, it’s a bruise on the ocean, a chunk of stone and silence where the wind cuts and the sea never sleeps. The lighthouse towers over it, a relic from the 1800s, its walls pitted, its iron cap flaked with rust, the beacon inside humming, a vibration that crawls into your jaw, its light slicing through fog that hangs heavy. The cottage clings to its base, a squat box of granite, its windows cloudy, its door warped, looking warm until you cross the threshold and feel its weight, like it’s waiting for you to slip. Inside, the main room’s bare, a table scratched deep, a stove that hisses, a desk heavy with age, all smelling of damp wood and oil, the floor chilling your feet through socks. Upstairs, two bedrooms, mattresses thin, blankets stiff, a hallway where shadows sit, untouched by the single bulb buzzing above. Riley didn’t care, his eyes lit up as he kicked open the door, hauling our bags, his voice booming, “Check this, man, our own fort, no one to bug us!” He dropped his duffel, spun around, hands wide, “Give it a month, we’ll have my sketches up, your fish drawings, make it home.” His laugh was real, warm, filling the space, and I grinned, caught in his fire, but the cottage didn’t answer, its silence thick, soaking up his words like a sponge, giving back nothing but a creak, a sigh from the walls.
We threw ourselves into the work, sweeping dirt from corners, oiling the beacon’s gears, their grind loud, steady, something to hold onto. Riley took the tower, climbing its spiral stairs, his boots echoing, his whistle sharp, some old tune he’d hum when happy, while I scrubbed the cottage, my hands raw, my mind drifting to the sea outside, its roar never fading. He’d call down, teasing, “You slacking already, professor, need me to do your job too?” I’d yell back, “Keep dreaming, grease monkey, I’m carrying you!” and his laugh would drift down, grounding me, making the island feel smaller, safer. We’d sit at night, splitting canned stew, Riley waving his spoon, planning, “We save up, fix a boat, sail wherever, you pick the reef, I’ll steer.” I’d nod, my chest lighter, his plans painting a future I could almost touch, but the cottage listened, its walls cold, the windows fogging, like they knew something we didn’t.
The work wasn’t just chores, it was a rhythm, a way to claim the place, make it ours. Riley tackled the beacon first, his hands sure, wiping grime from the lens, a massive glass eye that seemed to watch us, its hum deeper when he touched it, like it approved. “This thing’s alive, man,” he said, half-joking, his voice echoing in the tower, but his grin faded when the gears skipped, a groan that wasn’t mechanical, not quite. I stayed below, organizing supplies, stacking crates, my fingers brushing labels faded by salt, my mind on Riley’s whistle, steady, until it stopped, suddenly, his shout sharp, “Yo, come up here, something’s weird!” I ran, stairs clanging, finding him by the lens, his face pale, pointing at a crack, hairline, new, not there yesterday. “Swear it just moved,” he said, his voice low, his hand on my arm, tight. I looked, saw nothing, but the hum spiked, a note that hurt, and we backed down, fast, Riley muttering, “Probably nothing, right, just old junk.” But he didn’t whistle again, not that day, his eyes on the stairs, like they might follow.

Tor, the supply boat captain, came on day three, her skiff battling waves, crates of soup, rope, and fuel stacked high, her hands quick, unloading like she couldn’t wait to leave. She’s weathered, her face lined deep, her gray braid stiff, her eyes gray, sharp, like she’s staring through you, past you, to something waiting. She dropped the crates, her voice rough, “Light doesn’t stop, you hear, not ever.” I nodded, trying to be friendly, “Nice place, huh, you come here a lot?” She didn’t smile, her gaze cutting to Riley, who was stacking cans, his shirt damp, his hair a mess. “Stay close, both of you,” she said, softer, her jaw tight, like the words cost her. Riley looked up, grinning, “What, we got bears out here, Tor?” She didn’t laugh, just turned, her boots scraping, muttering, “Worse,” so low I barely caught it. I stepped closer, “What’s that mean, what’s worse?” but she was already at her boat, her hands shaking, untying ropes, gone before I could push, the fog swallowing her wake. Riley shrugged, wiping sweat, “She’s intense, man, probably hates people.” But his grin faded, his hand resting on his knife, tucked in his belt, as we hauled the crates inside, the air thicker, like it carried her words.

I tried talking to him about it, later, splitting bread by the stove, the room dim, the sea growled loudly through the walls. “Tor’s hiding something, you saw her eyes, right, like she’s scared,” I said, my voice low, my hands tearing crusts, restless. Riley leaned back, his chair creaking, his grin forced, “She’s old, probably seen storms, wrecks, you know, gets to you.” I shook my head, “No, it’s more, she meant something, worse than bears, come on.” He sighed, rubbing his neck, “What, you think she’s warning us about ghosts, pirates, what?” His laugh was thin, his eyes flicking to the window, where the fog pressed, heavy, close. “Maybe not ghosts,” I said, softer, “but something, you felt the beacon, didn’t you?” He nodded, slowly, “Yeah, felt like it was looking at me, stupid, but yeah.” We didn’t say more, just ate, the silence heavy, Riley’s hand brushing mine, quick, like he needed to know I was there.

The island wasn’t just quiet, it was alive, playing games we didn’t understand. We walked its paths, trails twisting through pines, their branches low, the cliffs sharp, dropping to reefs where the sea churned, foam curling like fingers. Riley kicked rocks, joking about diving, “Bet there’s fish down there you’d nerd out over, right?” His voice was light, but his eyes lingered on the water, scanning, uneasy, like he felt it too, the weight, the pull. Gulls swarmed, more than normal, their wings loud, their cries wrong, not squawks but wails, names, almost words, echoing in the fog. “These birds are freaks,” I said, trying to laugh, and Riley threw a stick, “Scram, weirdos!” but they didn’t budge, their eyes locked on us, yellow, unblinking, too many, too close. He grabbed my arm, “Let’s move, man, they’re giving me the creeps.” We hurried back, the cottage’s outline faint, the sea’s growl chasing us, louder, hungrier, Riley’s hand tight, his pulse fast against my wrist.

The next day, I found something else, not the logbook yet, but a sign, small, stupid, enough to twist my gut. I was checking the dock, making sure Tor’s ropes hadn’t frayed, when I saw it, a pebble, not random, placed dead center, carved with a spiral, tiny, perfect, like the ones I’d see later. I picked it up, cold, heavier than it should be, and showed Riley, my voice low, “This wasn’t here yesterday, right?” He frowned, turning it in his hand, “Nah, man, probably kids, some hikers, you know.” But his voice was off, his thumb tracing the spiral, his eyes on the sea, where the waves rolled, too smooth, too deliberate. “Kids don’t come here,” I said, and he nodded, dropping the pebble, “Yeah, okay, it’s weird, let’s just, let’s keep moving.” We didn’t talk about it again, but I kept it, tucked in my pocket, its weight a reminder, a question I couldn’t ask.

On day six, I found the logbook. I was dusting the keeper’s desk, its surface rough, when my cloth caught a hidden drawer, tucked tight, secret unless you felt for it. My heart kicked, a puzzle calling, and I shouted for Riley, my voice was sharp, “Yo, get in here, found something!” He jogged over, his boots loud, his hair wet from checking the beacon, his grin wide, “What, buried gold, captain?” He leaned close, his shoulder brushing mine, his warmth real, steady. I pried the drawer with his screwdriver, the wood groaning, and pulled out a book, not a record but something ancient, its leather cracked, smelling of rot and salt, its pages thick, curling, like they’d been soaked and baked dry. I opened it, expecting tide charts, but saw symbols, carved deep, spirals, waves, moons, stars with sharp points, a code scratched with a knife, not ink. Above them, in faded script, a warning: “To the Next Keeper. Heed or Drown.”

Riley sucked his teeth, his fingers tracing a spiral, his nail snagging, tearing the page, the rip loud, jarring. “Some old guy’s doodles, right, gotta be,” he said, but his voice cracked, his eyes flicking to the door, the sea’s roar spiking, sudden, close. I’m wired for mysteries, always decoding patterns for my research, so I grabbed my notebook, my hands itching, Riley hovering, his knee bouncing, his breath uneven. “You’re actually into this,” he said, half-laughing, but he didn’t move, stayed, watching as I worked, the symbols not random but deliberate, rituals tied to the island, commands with teeth, written by hands that shook, that ran. I decoded them, my pencil scratching, my voice low, scared I’d stir something, Riley’s silence heavy, his hand gripping the desk, like he needed an anchor.

Here’s what the logbook held, clear as a blade:
Scatter salt across the seaward window at dusk. Shadows swim in the deep, watching, waiting. Skip it, and they’ll slither through the glass.

Ring the fog bell three times at midnight, no more, no less. The mist hungers for sound, feeds on silence. Ignore it, and it’ll call your name.

Burn driftwood in the stove before dawn, every dawn. The cold craves warmth, your warmth. Let the fire die, and it’ll take your heat.

Seal the cellar hatch with wax when the moon rises. Whispers rise from below, seeking. Open it, and they’ll know your soul.

Trace a cross on the beacon’s glass at noon, with your breath, your hand. The light sees all, judges all. Forget it, and it’ll burn your eyes to ash.

Riley exhaled, hard, his knuckles white, “This is straight-up creepy, man, what’s with the warnings, who writes this?” I looked up, the window fogging, not breath but something else, the sea moving, not waves but shapes, faint, gone fast. “Dunno, but you heard the hum today, felt it, wasn’t just the gears,” I said, my throat tight. He nodded, slowly, “Yeah, like it’s alive, got eyes or something.” I pointed at the hatch, a trapdoor, dark, locked, “That one, the cellar, we're checking it?” He stepped back, “No way, you see that thing, looks cursed.” I swallowed, fear coiling, and he tried to laugh, “What, we gotta fight sea monsters now, you and me?” His hand landed on my shoulder, firm, but his eyes were scared, searching mine, needing me to say it’s nothing.
The logbook wasn’t done, its pages dense, symbols piling, some smudged, others slashed, like the writers turned on their own words. Notes scratched in margins, old hands, panicked, one from 1865, “Salt didn’t hold, she’s here,” another, 1927, “John’s voice, not his, God save me.” I shut it, my hands cold, Riley quiet, his jaw clenched. “We’re not playing this game, right,” he said, almost begging, his voice low, his grin gone. I wanted to agree, to burn the book, but the cottage shifted, the air heavy, the sea’s growl sharper, like it heard us. “Maybe just one, to be safe,” I said, soft, and he sighed, rubbing his face, “You’re nuts, man, but fine, I’m not leaving you to do it alone.” His loyalty, his fear, it cut me, deep, and I nodded, my throat burning, the logbook watching, waiting.

That night, I tried the first clue, Riley beside me, his knife gripped, not drawn but ready, his breath uneven. I took salt from Tor’s crate, coarse, heavy, and poured it across the seaward window’s sill, a shaky line, my fingers numb, the glass cold, the sea outside black, stirring, not natural, like eyes blinking under the surface. “This is stupid,” Riley whispered, his voice tight, but he didn’t move, his shoulder brushing mine, his warmth keeping me steady. The salt fell, and the sea’s roar softened, not stopped but hushed, like a beast turning away, its hunger elsewhere. We stood, frozen, the logbook on the table, open, its pages rustling though no wind stirred, the cottage’s silence louder, heavier, like it approved.

The next morning, the island pushed back. Riley was up first, brewing coffee, his hands steady, but his eyes kept drifting to the window, the sea beyond moving wrong, too slow, too smooth. “You sleep okay,” I asked, my voice rough, the logbook still on my mind, its symbols burned into my lids. He shrugged, pouring a mug, “Weird dreams, man, water everywhere, you shouting, couldn’t find you.” His grin was weak, his hand brushing mine, quick, like he needed to check I was real. I nodded, “Same, kept seeing that hatch, like it was calling.” He froze, coffee splashing, “Don’t say that, don’t even think about it, we’re not messing with that thing.” I wanted to push, to ask why he was so scared, but the fog bell rang, once, sharp, midday, no one near it, its clang cutting through us, Riley dropping his mug, the crash loud, coffee pooling like blood.
We ran to the dock, the bell still, rope untouched, the fog thick, curling around us, heavy, like it breathed. “What the hell was that,” Riley said, his voice sharp, his hand grabbing my sleeve, pulling me back. I didn’t know, couldn’t think, the clue ringing in my head, ring it three times, midnight, don’t miss. “We do it tonight, right, the bell,” I said, my throat dry, and he nodded, reluctant, “Yeah, fine, but this place, man, it’s wrong, you feel it.” I did, felt it in the air, the hum, the way the sea watched, but I didn’t say it, couldn’t, not with Riley’s eyes so wide, so scared.

That night, I rang the bell, three times, my hands slick, Riley beside me, his knife out now, glinting, the fog denser, pressing, like it wanted in. Each clang echoed, not fading but growing, the mist swirling, shapes forming, dissolving, Riley muttering, “This ain’t helping, man, it’s waking something.” I finished, the third ring heavy, and the fog stilled, not gone but waiting, the hum softer, approving, or mocking, I couldn’t tell. We backed to the cottage, Riley’s hand on my shoulder, “No more, okay, not tonight,” and I nodded, my heart pounding, the logbook’s weight in my pocket, pulling, always pulling.

The stove was next, the clue about driftwood, burn it before dawn, don’t let it die. We piled wood, Riley’s hands shaking, the flames weak, flickering blue, not right, Riley poking it, “This is crap, man, what’s with the color, you see this?” The smoke stung, curling toward the ceiling, shapes again, eyes, hands, gone when I blinked, my throat raw, Riley coughing, “We’re done, enough of this.” But we kept it burning, scared to stop, the cold outside heavier, pressing, like it wanted our warmth, our breath.
Yesterday, Riley vanished. He’d gone to fix a cliff marker, a rusted sign for ships, at dawn, his jacket loose, his grin soft, “Back soon, don’t hog the bacon,” winking, his boots fading into fog, his shape gone fast, too fast.

Noon came, no Riley, his tools by the door, his radio dead, static hissing, my hands shaking as I tried it, my voice breaking, “Riley, man, where you at, come on.” I searched, cliffs, beaches, caves, my throat raw, legs burning, shouting until the gulls answered, their cries his name, circling low, wings brushing me, cold, deliberate. Nothing, no trace, like he’d dissolved, like the island swallowed him whole.

Tor came at dusk, her boat loud, crates heavy, her face pale, eyes dodging mine. I ran to her, “Riley’s gone, Tor, he’s gone, you gotta help, call someone, please,” my voice cracking, hands grabbing her sleeve, desperate. She stood still, her jaw trembling, “Island keeps what it loves,” soft, like a wound she couldn’t close. I shook her, “What’s that mean, you know, tell me, what’s out there?” Her eyes hit the sea, waves stirring, too smooth, “That book’s theirs, boy, not yours, never was. Stop reading.” I screamed, “Whose, Tor, whose?” but she pulled free, her boat rocking, her voice low, “I told him, told you, don’t make me say it.” She was gone, fog closing, my shouts useless, the sea laughing, deep, real.

I stumbled to the cottage, the logbook open, a new clue waiting, ink wet, sharp, metallic: “Seek the tide’s edge for what’s lost.” My chest burned, hope and fear tangling, and I ran to the shore, flashlight dim, rocks gleaming, and there, in seaweed, Riley’s necklace, shark’s tooth glowing, not my light, something deeper, under the waves. I reached, and the water grabbed, cold, burning, pulling, my arm red, raw, when I broke free, the necklace sinking, the sea laughed louder, alive. I crawled back, skin stinging, the logbook waiting, pages turning, symbols shifting, Riley’s voice calling, not from the shore but everywhere, slow, wet, wrong.

Tor’s back tomorrow, maybe, but her words claw me, her fear, her secrets, like she’s watched this play out, like she’s next, or I am. The lighthouse hums, Riley’s name, twisted, pulling, the cottage waiting, always waiting. I’ve got my knife, flashlight, notebook, clues copied, hands shaking, ink smearing. I need Riley, his voice, his fight, but the island’s awake, and I’m not its keeper, I’m its prey. What’s in the tide, why me?

I work at a small college coffee shop. Since most of us on staff are students, we typically get 3 scheduled shifts (15 hours) a week. It’s pretty normal for shifts to be traded because people have assignments due or want to go home for the weekend.

One coworker in particular trades shifts or completely calls off more frequently than anyone else. It’s usually not a big deal, though myself and others have had to cover for him unexpectedly. 

In the month of March he worked 5 of his 12 scheduled shifts and was just given the Employee of the Month award for that month specifically. I am a little bit bothered by this, and by that I mean *a lot a bit bothered*, especially because I recently learned his dad is very buddy-buddy with the operator of dining services.

There are two other coworkers who I think really went above and beyond last month and should have gotten it.",12,1744680970.0,mildlyinfuriating,12,0.84,False

The first one has got to be [the one from Haden](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0B1382VV6). Given the price, it's probably not the best of the best but it's got all the features that I think are pretty essential for a good drip coffee maker. The first thing you’ve gotta look out for is lil knobs and wheelies that keep the temperature consistent. This is ESSENTIAL. Thing is, a good drip coffee can go bad qual real fast if the temperature doesn’t stay the same (I’ve found that 93°C works best for most roasts). The Haden one has this one thing down right, you can program it to your liking and, rain or shine, it won’t mess up. Also, its look is pretty retro, which I really need for my kitschy quirky kitchen. I'm not really into that sleek modern thing. I’ll put a picture in of the model I liked best, for reference.

Speaking of sleek and modern, the [Fellow aiden coffee maker](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0D8HVBVS6) looks completely different to the haden one, but has way better specs. The price point is like hefty to say the least especially compared to the Haden, but oh boy does the thing make up for it. You can control nearly every phase of the brewing process starting from the bloom all the way to the end. It actually seems really fun going through all the flavour profiles they have on their app and mixing and matching. Some of them might turn out a lil questionable, but it's a fun feature to have nonetheless. But my favourite one has got to be the scheduled brew toggle where you can schedule your brew to start before you're even up in the morning so it really saves on time in that regard. This one’s for sure a keeper. Heck, I’ll put a picture of this one in too.

1jzfrvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1jzfrvo/this_is_hell/,This is hell,"I'm a 58 year old female.  I've had IBS-C for many years now maybe 10 I seem to have had it under control through low FOD map and then I just started eating whatever I wanted and i was fine for many months. Then for some reason for 8 weeks now I'm having major flareups so I went back to low FOD map for 4 weeks. and then I've been gradually introducing some fodmaps  to see what's causing the horrible constipation and pain. I first I tried prunes and it was fine and then I tried pears and it seemed to be fine, and then I was feeling a bit better and then all of a sudden over the past two days, a major flareup which leaves me crying and losing my appetite. I feel so bad with this that I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong and what I'm eating that's wrong. 

How am I supposed to live my life with constantly doing an elimination diet? my body is really rebelling against me. I don't understand what is the trigger is whatsoever. Something tells me it was oatmeal that I had for two days but that's was four days ago. Could that cause problems ? I was in so much discomfort last night.  After I pulled it together I just had just chicken breast and steamed veggies , 5 prunes and a pear and magnesium supplements. Went to sleep and woke up and had a normal BM and felt fine.  

For breakfast I thought I could try to get some coffee and a muffin it was a (mochi muffin. ) no idea the ingredients but was gf for sure. I only drank 1//3 c of the coffee. I ate it really slow slowly like 1/4 of it over the course of two hours so I don't think that's what caused it. I got home from work. I've been feeling fine. All day started to make dinner was feeling fine and then I had to go to the bathroom and again horrible cramping vague pain, and constipation seemingly out of nowhere.  And I did not have a particularly stressful day either.  My job is super active. I'm always walking around and doing a bunch of stuff and I'm also drinking a lot of water. 
 
this feels so incredibly bad to have this vague cramping feeling inside your entire intestines and not being able to have a bowel movement it is so bad it just brings me to tears. I don't know what to do.  I can't figure out what's causing this.  😢

I’ve also been a heavy caffeine consumer (600mg+ daily), so I decided to try Dynamax Plus as a potential replacement for my usual energy drink. 

Product: https://nootropicsdepot.com/dynamax-plus/?tw_source=google&tw_adid=&tw_campaign=22352067244&tw_kwdid=&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAC-wIm9HOlNm5eWs98gdzXLwlFz-D&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-siH8e_YjAMV7zrUAR0PtgIdEAQYASABEgKT1fD_BwE

Ingredients:
1) Methylliberine (as Dynamine™) - 150 mg
-A naturally occurring compound found in kucha tea.
-Structurally similar to caffeine.
-Believed to promote alertness, energy, and mood without raising heart rate or blood pressure as much as caffeine.
2) Caffeine (Proprietary Blend: 270 mg total)
-Includes: ZümXR® DR Caffeine, ZümXR® ER Caffeine, Caffeine anhydrous
-These are different forms of caffeine designed for immediate and extended release.
-Together, they provide a quick boost of energy with a longer-lasting effect and reduced crash compared to regular caffeine.
3) L-Theanine - 100 mg
-An amino acid commonly found in green tea.
-Promotes relaxation and focus.
-When combined with caffeine, it can smooth out the stimulant’s effects, reducing jitteriness and improving attention.
4) Taurine - 100 mg
-An amino acid found in many energy drinks.
-May support neurological development and regulate water and mineral levels in the blood.
-Has a calming effect and may help with mental performance under stress.

Unfortunately, it hasn’t worked out for me. Rather than providing the expected boost, it’s actually made me feel more lethargic and anxious. 

I usually take one capsule first thing in the morning, then add coffee as needed—usually no more than two cups throughout the day. Around 4:30 PM, before my workout, I take a pre-workout that has 300mg of caffeine.

1jzfq4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jzfq4a/aita_for_throwing_boyfriends_photo_with_ex/,AITA for throwing boyfriends photo with EX,"My (39F) boyfriend Jack (37M) married his childhood sweetheart when they were 19 (they were “together” since they were twelve). She unexpectedly passed away when they were 27. I understand completely that losing her must have been so hard on him since they grew up together and everything. 

Jack and I met when he got a job at the company I worked at, and while he wasn’t really looking for a relationship at the time, I guess I grew on him since I would bring him coffee and check up on him. Eventually he agreed to a date and now we’ve been together for six months. 

I’ve always acknowledged that he’s going to have days where he misses her and that’s okay, but I also want to be respected and ask that he doesn’t bring her up around me and such. 

I always do a little surprise for him on our month anniversaries and so for our six months I wanted to do something a little extra special and asked his friend for a key to his apartment since he hasn’t invited me over yet, and I thought it would be really cute to clean up a bit, cook him dinner and get some flowers so that maybe he would warm up to the idea of us moving in together and maybe being intimate. 

Anyways, I took the day of our anniversary off from work, and told Jack to come over to my place in the evening. I went over to his apartment and started to clean up a few things that were laying around. That’s when I noticed a photo of him and his ex wife framed above the fireplace. It felt disrespectful but I decided to talk to him about removing it later, and continued cleaning. When I got to his bedroom I saw a travel booklet to this resort that I knew him and his ex wife went to for their honeymoon and I’ll admit, I got a little over-excited and assumed he was taking me there for our 6 month anniversary and might propose. At this point I didn’t really care about the photo and was just super excited. 

So fast forward to when he comes to his apartment after work. When he got inside I had candles set up and you could clearly smell the lasagna I made for dinner, but he didn’t even acknowledge any of that. He literally freaked out when he saw me. I got him to calm down a little and explained that I just wanted to do something special for him, and then I attempted to ease the tension by jokingly saying “I know its nothing compared to what you planned”. He asked me what I was talking about and I brought up the resort booklet. He literally paled and admitted that it wasn’t for us to go together and that he was going alone.

I asked him why and he said the 10 year anniversary of his exes death is coming up and he wants to feel closer to her by going somewhere where they were happiest. This broke my heart and I can’t lie I got really upset and accused him of loving her more than me and not being able to prioritize me. He started saying that she was his first love and they spent most of their life together and I would never understand how difficult that is. I got really mad and I picked up the photo from the fireplace and threw it onto the carpet (it didn’t even break or anything) and said that I was done being disrespected by him and that he could call me tomorrow, and then I left. 

I called one of my girlfriends and she said I was the asshole and that I need to apologize, but I think he’s the one who was in the wrong. So, AITA?

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve had no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know.

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

I call out, but all I get is pure static silence. I'm literally fading in this weak and hollow lonely abyss. It's devoid of so much common sense and ideas. Mapping my own social circle makes things harder to pinpoint at, when I have a single friend to rely on it's just toxic controlling friendship, when I have multiple people it's all fake. it's all pretending. am I asking for too much to have a single respectful permeant connection that's built on love and common sense? and when I like someone they usually just fall into a maze that ends up changing them forever. seeing them fall one by one when I could've saved them, kept them the way there were before they changed (whether to the worse or the better), I feel selfish, but truth be said, when I like someone I like them for who they are. and when they defy my wishes and turn their heads towards a brand new hell, really hurts so much. I've charted almost every single mental territory and I really mean it. I've lost enough already that there's nothing else to lose (A physical place I can call home/nation, a mental place to call home, friendships, relationships, connections, science, music, engineering, everything you can think about is unreachable atp), nothing to gain, the only thing that's left is my own will to keep my massively deep soul from colliding with its fate. and I already set up a date for that. I set up a date somewhere next year, no more farewell. and I made up my mind unless things take a massive toll for a change, for now I am enjoying the rest of my life, those beautiful blue skies, those clouds, even the burning sun, the corner grocery store, the instant coffee, my degree, my fake friendships, new music releases, energy drinks, dopamine, everything. I will enjoy them until my last drop. this decision didn't come within a day or two, it took almost a year to decide, and I'm still in my head: yeah, I won't do it. I don't have the courage, but yes.

I've recently started my fragrance collection journey and could use some guidance from you experienced folks! So far, my small collection includes Afnan Modest Une, and I've just ordered a tester of Versace Dylan Blue (from Well Scented). My next planned purchase is Armaf Club de Nuit Intense Man. I had a decant before and absolutely loved it, so a full bottle is definitely happening. Beyond that, I'm looking to explore more and have a few on my radar that I'd love opinions on, especially since I haven't smelled most of them yet:

• Afnan 9 pm: Hear a lot about this one for cooler weather/ nights. I actually had a decant of Lattafa Ramz Silver and quite liked it actually not sure- heard it's very similar to 9pm. Is 9pm still worth getting if I liked Ramz Silver, or are they too redundant?

• Lattafa Khamrah vs. Khamrah Qahwa: I'm intrigued by this line. Would you recommend getting the original Khamrah or the newer Khamrah Oahwa with the coffee note? How different are they, and which do you prefer?

• Azzaro The Most Wanted: I tried one in a mall (pretty sure it was The Most Wanted Intense) and honestly didn't enjoy it. It came across very cinnamon-heavy, almost like agarbatti (incense sticks) to my nose. Is this typical? Are the other versions (like the EDP or Parfum) significantly different and worth trying, or should I steer clear based on my reaction to the Intense?

• Maison Alhambra Clones: Seeing a lot of buzz around their clones, particularly for LV Imagination and Pacific Chill. Are they worth checking out? Seller Recommendations Needed! This is where I could really use your help. I'm looking for trusted sellers with good prices for:

• Middle Eastern Fragrances: (Like Lattafa, Afnan, Armaf etc.)

• Designer Fragrances/Testers: Beyond Dylan Blue, looking for options.

• Decants: I know there's the Excel sheet (which I have referred to), but I'd love to hear your personal go-to sellers for reliable decants to explore more scents without committing to full bottles. (Side note: I tried reaching out to Flashy Pay on WhatsApp based on recommendations, but haven't gotten a response yet.) Thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom and helping out a newbie! Excited to explore this world more.",1,1744680046.0,fragranceclones,10,1.0,False

1jzfkcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVegans/comments/1jzfkcw/still_early_in_the_journey_but_i_think_im/,Still early in the journey… but I think I’m becoming vegan,"Hey everyone—I hope this is the right place to post this. I’m still kind of new to this lifestyle, and I’ve been reflecting a lot on why I made this choice and how it’s reshaped the way I think about food, ethics, and myself.

I grew up in a lower middle class family that was typically carnivorous and heavy on fast food. It didn’t do much for my health, and I’ve struggled with weight issues for most of my life. Last year, I started working as a security guard. It wasn’t a bad job, but it made things worse physically—I was stuck in the guard box for 8 hours a day and mostly ordered food through DoorDash. I wanted to do better, but alternatives were hard to find.

Around that time, I came across *Diet for a Small Planet*, and something clicked. I started experimenting with vegetarian meals—simple recipes I found online. At first it was casual, but it planted a seed.

Things really shifted during Lent this year. I decided to give up meat on Wednesdays and Fridays, and reduce my consumption overall. At first it was a spiritual discipline—but it stuck. There was something about it that made me feel more grounded, more compassionate, more *me*. One small shift led to another, and I started to notice… I wasn’t eating much meat at all.

I remember sitting in a Subway one day. As I placed my order, the woman behind me asked, “Why don’t you eat meat? Are you vegetarian?” I replied, “I’m trying to be.” It was a fast day. She smiled and told me she rarely ate meat herself. Later, I checked my food log and realized—I hadn’t eaten any animal products that day. In fact, I was down to eating meat maybe once a week. That moment really stayed with me.

A few days later, my dad took me out after church. I told myself I’d save meat for family occasions. We went to IHOP, and the waitress asked, “Do you want the bacon with the bananas foster?” “No, not that.” “Sausage?” “No sausage.” She paused. “So… no meat at all?” I laughed awkwardly, but yeah—no meat. And you know what? The meal was great.

Later that morning, my dad took me grocery shopping. He’s a very conservative guy and loves meat, but he’s always been supportive of my weight loss efforts—and I think he sees how much this change means to me. I told him I was going to make orange tofu and vegetarian BBQ wings. He even pointed out that Walmart sells plant-based cheese. He picked it up and laughed in a kind of impressed way. At checkout, he joked, “What about the chicken?” I told him, “There is no chicken. It’s a vegetarian recipe.” We laughed.

But that night I stayed up thinking. *Plant-based cheese? At Walmart? What does this mean for me? Could I go without milk and cheese too? Could I actually do this?*

Even switching to soy milk in my coffee had felt like a huge change at first. But the more I thought about it, the less appealing animal products became—not just physically, but spiritually. I started to feel differently about what I put into my body.

One day, I poured cow’s milk into my coffee like I always used to. I took a few sips… and something didn’t sit right. I thought about what a cow had to go through for that milk to get there. I remembered reading that mother cows grieve after being separated from their calves—they cry, pace, search for their babies. And in that moment, I thought, “Someone lost their mama so humans could have this.” I felt my eyes begin to water and I shed a small tear. The milk didn’t taste right. It wasn’t spoiled, but it felt wrong. I haven’t touched cow’s milk since that day.

Since embracing this plant-based journey, I’ve also experienced positive changes in my health. I’ve lost 12 pounds and my ibs has become less of an issue. 

I don’t know if I’m ready to call myself a “perfect vegan,” but I’ve stopped seeing this as just a temporary phase. I care about animals. I care about the climate. And I care about how food affects my body and spirit. I want my choices to reflect those values—even if I’m still working out the details.

I don’t think I’ll ever be the preachy type. But I do believe this is the right path. Sometimes it feels isolating—especially when people make snide comments or act like I’m just trying to be different. I’m really not. I just want to live in a way that causes less harm.

So yeah… I guess I just wanted to share my story. If you’ve got encouragement, your own journey, advice, or just want to say hi—I’d love that too. This choice feels right, but it can feel heavy sometimes. Thanks for reading.",9,1744680021.0,AskVegans,4,1.0,False

Coffee instant prices are at an all time high.

1jzfgv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jzfgv8/my_friend_25f_was_dating_a_17m_and_i_fully/,My friend (25F) was dating a (17M) and I fully support it.,"Let me start by describing what I know about both of them since her and I grew up together in my hometown.

She's always been abused by her family. Always treated like shit compared to the kids around her. Her mom was a convicted criminal and her dad a narcissist who expected her to be perfect. She always told me her siblings would get her toys and break them and the dad would enable them and tell her to suck it up and to share everything with them (her mom bought toys for her when they saw each other since her dad didn't want to buy anything). Then her stepmom came and everything went to hell for her. The stepmom accused her constantly of being a psychopath and she was turned into the Cinderella of the family. She was never allowed to go out, bring friends or even have a phone (the dad found out the mom had bought her one when she was 14 and he made her watch as he smashed it with a hammer). Her dream was to become a singer. She is one nowadays so I'm happy about that. She got kicked out of her home by the stepmom at 17 and had to work her way up. They allowed her to stay at a house they had in the ghetto that even I wouldn't go because of how unsafe the area was. Then she began dating the lamest jerk in the world (wouldn't invite her for a coffee not even ONCE, and he was loaded, never took her anywhere, porn addict...) We stopped talking at that point... I was fed up with his bs and her not acknowledging she deserved better. Sometime a few years later we reconnected and she told me she was on a friend's discord and there was a kid trying to flirt with her. She didn't pay any attention but brought it up as a fun fact. Another important thing is that she never learned to set up boundaries with anyone (which led her to that shitty relationship and many more encounters), so she never shut him down directly, she just ignored it like she always does. The kid kept insisting and trying his best (some of his texts were hilarious). When they had a group call on DC, he turned on his webcam and that's when she started feeling like shit. Apparently he was the hottest guy she had ever seen. I remember she spent months researching about ways to cure pedophilia (she thought she was a monster for being attracted to him). I honestly told her to hit and dip, all her boyfriends have been 3-8y older than her, she's very obviously not a serial minor targeter or a creep imo.

 Then one day she traveled to meet the group again (they were from another state) and the kid was there. Turns out not only does he tower over her, he's also for some reason older looking and since she's younger looking they appear to be the same age. I personally think although the age gap is questionable, based on looks and their personalities they're a match made in heaven (yes I'm biased towards him, he's such a nice fella and gets along with my brother).

Here comes his story. He came from a family with an enmeshed mother and a cheater as a father. The dad left and the mom used him as her therapist and new husband (even when she started dating someone else she would cancel dates to ""be with her son""). Total weirdo and Alabama vibes   if you ask me. Then she was hospitalized and he had to live alone for a month at 14. After that, he suffered bullying as a result of a physical deformity and he kept being the psychologist in his mom's house. A total mess. At 16 he was stalked and SAd by his ex, and that was his life until he met Sarah (my friend). I don't know more details, just what she's told me.

So the guy treated Sarah like a princess, and she started falling for him as they just seemed to get along without any effort. She told me there were things here and there that reminded her he was still a kid, but couldn't help but like him more and more as months passed. When they met in person he got serious and asked her out. She said yes in a ""we'll see"" way, and didn't want to formalize anything until when he turned 18. They kept talking on DC and calling. He visited a couple times too, and as soon as he turned 18 they told everyone officially. The kid is like a parent to her emotionally. I have never seen anyone so capable of keeping her PTSD under control and I've seen real growth this past year. She finally finished her studies and got a job, even went to therapy for her panic attacks. She's like a parent to him experience-wise, she helps him navigate through the world and becoming an adult slowly. 

A year later he's told me he's going to propose in a couple years. I just can't not support them. He's taught her so many things and I'm happy to see my friend glow. I know she sometimes cries because this relationship adds to the ""not being enough"" for her family but she's happy and maturing, which is worth it. She already accepted he might change and they might break up as he grows so I've seen her not give in fully as a forever thing (for now), but the kid is convinced they are locked in forever and will get married and have children within the next 5 years. They are now 27 and 19. She's adapted very well to his more childish part and he feels normal with her as before her he was practically a husband already... Dunno, I'm keeping his age a secret from her parents but I don't see the issue other than fucking societal standards.

When we would go out to eat (as friends), he would always pay for our food together. At first, I didn't question it because he would say it was a way of paying me back (I help him with his homework a lot). I thought, cool, free food. But now it's like a reoccurring thing. On Saturday, we went to Philly and got boba from a boba shop. I offered to pay for his drink with mine, but he said no need and pulled out his card, tapping it on the card machine before I could say okay or not. He did it again when we got ramen, and I got annoyed.

A little background, he comes from a wealthy family. His family has their own business in construction. He always had a large allowance, and he works for his family sometimes, so they pay him too. I have a weekend job, now as a cashier. I don't make as much as him, but I have enough to treat him out for something. I've tried, but he never accepts it, telling me I should just save my money. He said it's also a waste for me to buy him lunch, since my parents check my receipts and statements anyway.

I feel really bad. I've stopped ordering drinks or lunches when we go out together. I don't want him to pay for everything. A few of my friends don't think there's anything wrong with it. The rest of my friends think that if I let him keep doing this, I'll be a 'gold digger' or something. Today at school, he wanted to buy me some coffee or food there, but I said no. He looked sad when I said that, and now I feel even worse. Some of my friends said I was rude.

I appreciate the things he does, but I don't want him to think that I'm taking advantage of him. I always cook and bake for him on a weekly basis, and make him a lot of homemade gifts to show my love and appreciation. And, like I said, I stopped ordering things when we go out. But sometimes he does it anyway. But WIBTH if I let him continue to do this?

After trying multiple flavours in version 1.1 to finally find my favourite (Cookies & Cream,Salted Caramel was ok) They have now changed Cookies & Cream and it's rather unpleasant.(& I unfortunately was unaware of the new formula and bought multiple bags)  
  
Flavour is incredibly important to me as when I don't feel like eating forcing myself to eat something I don't like tends to make food more aversive,also I don't have energy to add things to change the flavour due to illness.

I thought of switching to Eleat cereal instead (the protein helps with some medical conditions to help me have a little more energy) but it has less protein per serving ,I'm not a huge fan of the granola and the rest of them mainly have processes finely ground carbs (rice,corn flour....),saw another vegan protein shake meal replacement but it has sucralose which gives me severe stomach cramps. If you have any UK alternatives with stevia please list them below. 

I'm not up for trying all the flavours again financially,so maybe taste descriptions will help me narrow down to a few since there are no official smaller sample packs.(not willing to risk it gut safety/hyghiene wise from someone on EBay/Amazon who opens packets & cuts them into sample packs)

Taste wise:  
The RTD black chocolate (found it disgusting)  
The RTD black vanilla (acceptable)  
I haven't tried any black chocolate powder,but do enjoy the taste of Alpro soya chocolate flavour

I dislike coffee in any form,even just the smell makes me nauseous.  
Someone listed Angels delight as resembling a version 1.1 strawberry and that was an okay flavour,I'm guessing v 1.2 is different now

I may have tried cinnamon swirl v.1.1 but didn't buy it again.  
Salted Caramel 1.1 was ok,it grew on me but that took a long time.  
Once bought Bulk powder pea protein that had banana & stevia,really disliked the flavour

I also picked up a Cafec Deep 27 at Hands for only about $12 USD. First try was this amazing Ethiopian from Glitch. Super excited to use this, as it can really help stretch this 50g bag. ",10,1744679240.0,pourover,0,0.92,False

To be clear: I’m gringo but my family is from MG and I speak fluent pt. I’m not worried about language barrier.

We’re set up to save between 60-100k depending on how many years we give it before we leave the US. I’m a firefighter with a finance degree making 84k/yr before overtime/taxes, he’s a remote systems admin making 84k/yr before taxes. I was a mortgage loan officer for 2.5yrs before i joined the fire department.

Im thinking I will move into remote medical billing/virtual assistant for the move. Im considering earning systems administration certs before moving just to secure the higher income but am okay with earning less since there are two of us.  We make about $R47.800 or $8,400 usd right now. But this will change and i want to imagine the worst. 

We just want our money to go further and escape the shallow relationships here. We have to work so many hours every week to afford to beat our debt and increasing prices even when we make good money. We want to connect more with nature, passing time with friends with bbqs, coffee, being at the beach.

We figure we can buy a house once we visit a few times since property will be cheaper than renting.

Idk. Do you think we can live well with $4000 usd per month? I believe this is $R22.800 per month. Worst case scenario is that we both end up working minimum wage at State Farm making $30,000/yr each. Best case scenario, he only reduces his salary to $60,000/yr and i work for $30,000/yr.",0,1744679209.0,Brazil,7,0.45,False

Shadow slave has a truly impressive lore and it's fun to analyze especially being caught up.   
  
I'm trying this as a kind of pilot. I find this kind of content fun but do people want videos like this? Just written posts? Do we want lit analysis at all? Should I have an AI read it with Subway surfer playing? 

# Grounded Dystopia

I don’t usually enjoy dystopian fiction, especially post-apocalyptic Earth, because of the tired tropes and lazy world-building. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and detail in the opening of Shadow Slave. From the beginning, Shadow Slave establishes an immersive world through grounded economic and environmental details. We’re told about luxuries like coffee and the scarcity of real meat, highlighting how dramatically society has changed in a world plagued by a magical pandemic.

Rather than relying on exposition dumps, the novel introduces its protagonist, Sunny (Sunless), as an orphan from the outskirts who contracts the magical virus “the nightmare spell.” His visit to the police station serves as a natural means of introducing the world’s social structure. Knowledge of surviving the spell and gaining magical abilities is held tightly by society’s elite. Sunny’s ignorance is not unreasonable—it’s a realistic product of his environment and a strong justification for why the reader learns the rules of the world alongside him. The police officer’s statement that “The spell sets up trials, not executions” establishes the law for the events to come

# Earned Development

Sunny’s entry into the First Nightmare begins with him chained in a slave caravan, climbing a snowy mountain—a poetic and symbolic image. Discovering his aspect, **\[Temple Slave\]**, which offers him no special abilities, he realized he entered the nightmare the same way he left Earth: bound and powerless. However, he receives the most brilliant narrative device I've ever seen. Sunny is granted the attribute **\[Fated\]**, which predisposes him to unlikely scenarios—sometimes astonishingly lucky, sometimes disastrously unlucky. The description reads: *“There are those who are blessed, and* *there are those who are cursed… but rarely both.”* Combined with his **\[Mark of Divinity\]**, this doesn’t just explain “plot armor”—it justifies it. It feels natural that this kid would stumble into god-tier chaos. It’s divine mischief, but rooted in the logic of the magic system.   
  
The remainder of the nightmare offers a vivid introduction to Sunny’s character. His behavior doesn’t display superhuman intellect, but rather the cunning and survival instincts we’d expect from someone who’s lived his whole life on the streets. 

His deep mistrust of others is not only believable—it’s necessary. Sunny’s decision to poison his temporary allies before they could betray him was ruthless, but logical. It was a move born from the realities of the outskirts, and from a lifetime of being forced to rely on no one but himself. That move—cold and calculated—was immensely satisfying because it solidified Sunny’s character: a devious underdog who survives not by brute force, but by letting others underestimate him.   
  
Sunny’s occasional references to webtoons broke the story a little bit. These self-aware, fourth-wall-adjacent comments feel out of place—especially for a character so poor he is malnourished its unlikely he'd have access to media but it's a minor complaint.

# Living World

Even within the confined space of this first nightmare, *Shadow Slave* plants deep roots for its lore. The **\[Temple Slave\]** was met with unease by other characters in the dream, hinting at a buried cultural or religious significance that even Sunny doesn’t understand. The world feels ancient, and the people within the nightmare seem to live lives with their own histories. It doesn’t feel fabricated; it feels remembered.

At the arc’s climax, Sunny stumbles into a nameless temple—an entry permitted by his **\[Temple Slave\]** aspect—and collapses onto an ancient altar. What follows is not metaphorical but literal: an unnamed god answers. This moment reframes the entire arc. The forgotten dead gods are not so dead. This divine intervention not only saves Sunny’s life—it retroactively reveals that the nightmare realm is not merely a trial, but a gateway to an expansive mythology that felt unimportant as a result of the surreal, game-like nature of the setting. 

# Conclusion

Sunny’s appraisal is shocking both for Sunny and the reader due to receiving a divine rank and his aspect evolving from **\[Temple Slave\]** to **\[Shadow Slave\]**. Then, in perfect tonal whiplash, the spell announces his flaw: **\[Clear Conscious\]**—a trait that makes it impossible for him to lie. For someone who has survived through necessary wit, deception, and street-level cunning, the inability to lie is both tragic and hilarious. 

The first mini-arc of Shadow Slave delivers an impressive amount of narrative weight in a short span. The world-building is dense but digestible. The character development is natural and earned. The magic system is intricate without being overwhelming. Above all, this arc sets a precedent: this is a story where consequences matter, and every scrap of luck has a price.

1jzf8dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nissanfrontier/comments/1jzf8dy/another_exhausting_lift_vs_level_question_post/,Another exhausting lift vs level question post,"As the title suggests, I’m currently out here weighing my options for a lift or leveling kit. 

Was out for coffee with the wife this weekend and as we’re sitting outside, she looks right at my D…41 and, completely unprompted (not kidding) says the words every man longs to hear “I think you should lift the truck, it would look really good”

So, wasting no time for fear that she will change her mind, I’ve reignited the hunt for a budget friendly option. We live in an area where off-roading is an option but not the priority for us. The main objective here would be to add a small lift (~2.5-3”) and take care of the crazy amount of rake Frontiers come with.

As of right now, my two options that I’ve come across are about the same price point. I’m between doing the following:
- ADO Spacer Eraser (formerly RCKilla) kit w/ adjustable cam bolts, add 0.5” spacers and loaded UCAs ($1049) which’ll add 2.5” front and 1.5” rear
- Z1 2.5” spacer/shackle lift, offset eccentric bolt lock-out kit, and Z1 UCAs ($985) which’ll add 2.5” front and 1.5” rear

For tire fitment, I’m planning on keeping the OEM p4x wheels and putting on BFG all-terrain T/A KO2s in 285/70/17 instead of 255/85/17 since I can get the 285s from Costco

My question is whether anyone has run either/both of these setups and what their review of them would be. 

Don’t tear me to shreds for this but also considering ~1” wheel spacers for a slightly more aggressive stance but know they’re really not the best for the suspension so, in reality, will most likely stray away from them. ",1,1744679017.0,nissanfrontier,4,0.67,False
