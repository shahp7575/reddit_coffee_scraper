After trying to bring up my concerns she immediately shut me down and told me to get over it and to just think positively.

1gq0c06,https://i.redd.it/zve3lzptek0e1.jpeg,Flor De Las Antillas Maduro Toro Gordo (6 1/2 x 56)  Review below.,"Beautiful dark mahogany color with a light oily sheen. Excellent wrap with very smooth seams with almost imperceptible fine veins. Excellent draw and initial smoke production is plentiful with a nice syrupy, not quite creamy texture. Burn through the first third is uneven, but not a problem requiring attention. Wood and pepper are main tones, but neither are overpowering. Typical hints of natural Maduro tobacco sweetness. By the end of the first third the smoke has taken on a creamier texture and the pepper has become more of a general spiciness in the background. Also in the background is a dried dark fruit sweetness that continues into the second third.

As the second third progresses dark coffee has joined the mild woodiness and leather. The overall profile has become quite creamy. There is a full richness to the flavor that is enjoyable. By the middle of the second third very dark chocolate has joined the party. Like the dark chocolate you get from an 80% cocoa dark chocolate bar. The burn continued to be uneven, but only needed one touch up.

The final third saw an increase in spiciness that transitioned into a more forward black pepper spice and the background fruit sweetness disappeared. While the smoke output was still plentiful, it lost the creaminess of the first 2/3‚Äôs. The dark coffee took on more of a sharper espresso note and the dark chocolate was only a memory. The final third was a step back and was more reminiscent of the peppery and the somewhat sharp flavor profile I‚Äôve gotten from previous My Father cigars. 

Overall this was an excellent cigar through the first two thirds and was the most enjoyable My Father cigar I‚Äôve smoked. Unfortunately for my palate the final third, while not bad, was a distinct step back. I‚Äôll definable give the Flor De Las Antillas Maduro another try, but in a standard Toro or Corona to see if that makes a difference.

I‚Äôve had to add formula into his diet since I wasn‚Äôt producing enough milk, and only pumping to give him milk at night - since that‚Äôs all that I made. But all the left over milk he doesn‚Äôt drink from 8pm-8am, I put into bags and freeze, and I‚Äôve been able to start building a supple that way. 

We went to the doctor for one issue and at the end of the visit I found out that my baby has an allergy to cows milk. He‚Äôs only 3mo. I thought allergies didn‚Äôt develop in babies until 6mo? Anyways - I ended up having to switch up his formula to one that‚Äôs not milk based, and is mainly corn syrup solids (which I really REALLY don‚Äôt like, but my baby needs to eat and he‚Äôs happier on this formula). And I thought everything was fine until RECENTLY, I found specs of blood in his poopy diaper. Like I‚Äôm talking bright red, and mucousy blood. 

I told the doctor with pictures and everything, she said that it‚Äôs from the cows milk allergy and that it‚Äôll take 14 days for him to fully adjust to the new formula he‚Äôs on, since it takes the same amount of time for the old formula to leave his system (which was cows milk based‚Ä¶ I had to give him this from my lowered supply after mastitis). BUT here‚Äôs the kicker, she also told me that my diet could affect the milk he gets that I pump. Which, okay, I‚Äôll change my diet to stop eating dairy so it doesn‚Äôt upset his stomach, no big deal. Then it hit me ‚Ä¶ what the heck am I going to do with all the milk I stirred up in the freezer for him?!?! All that milk took me so long to start saving up and it all has cows milk from when I ate it. I drink coffee every morning with creamer, I eat ice cream on occasion, I eat pizza on occasion, and I drink milk on occasion. All those occasional diary indulgences are present in my breastmilk that Ive been stocking up to save for him. 

So now I have to build a whole new stash, but i have no idea what to do with the milk I already have in my freezer‚Ä¶ all the work I put into trying to build something for him, all seems invalid since I have to start ALLLLLLLL over again! ",1,1731458409.0,ExclusivelyPumping,2,1.0,False

i abandoned her. i wrecked her house, because i thought that was what it meant to be alive. i saw the smaller portions on the plate and i still stole her food. i saw the little money in her bank and i still took every penny. i forced her to watch while i destroyed myself, my body, and dug myself a deeper hole full of hatred and lies. then sunk my teeth in as hard as i could, clung onto her, thoughtlessly sucked all of the love, warmth, energy and colour out of her body and out of perfect selfishness dragged her down with me. i admit i broke my mother. i drove her into a hole down to insanity and failure and she trusted me with her life, even if i didn‚Äôt know the first thing about cars. she believed i loved her as much as she did, why would she have her seatbelt on?

now my life is, and will always be, dark and gloomy and grey. monotonous and unfortunate, unworthy and forgettable. i‚Äôm completely alone. nobody truly loves me. nobody even appreciates my conversation or takes the time to even listen. nobody will ever love me like my mother did. i‚Äôm long lost, gone. i‚Äôm the remains, the black corpse of a beautiful, innocent, colourful girl buried far, far underneath the ground. i‚Äôm nothing but a white ghost who stands in plain sight amongst the varying gradient of people who still bother to cling to their souls, but my desperate redemption is a thing of the past. i cannot restart, i cannot live remembering but i cannot forget. i‚Äôm utterly miserable and i‚Äôm stuck missing you, my other half. i know i made a reckless mistake, foolishly thinking i needed my independence, but i can‚Äôt live like this on my own anymore. i live in a sick childhood fairytale where i purposefully pretend to hate you out of spite, but it‚Äôs my own guilt and shame. it wasn‚Äôt until i was tied to a fable prison of my own making and i have no choice but to live with soul eaters, that i deeply feel this empathy for you, after i tore and devoured chunks out of you. the irony of how the tables have turned. 

i still long everyday for the heat of your boundless and forever powerful compassion to comfort my cold and heartless corpse, plagued with apathy. you just wanted to know i loved you, but i didn‚Äôt tell you because i thought it would be the vulnerability that would kill me. but it‚Äôs the absence of you.

you brought the zest of life to me. and in return i dirty and poison your name with my filthy, infectious tongue. i turned your soft and delicate skin black and blue. i stole your potential at life with my very birth and existence, but you always thought i was your tiny miracle. i callously ruined everything you worked hard to get, your job, later your chances at one, your degree, your reputation, your brand new house, a home i could never afford. you briefly saw a door open, your potential to restart without me, and i killed this unborn child out of jealousy. i smashed my new iphone 4s on the ground that you saved and starved for, in front of your very eyes. i always expected more from you after you gave me everything you had.

mum, i love you. but you made me want to die.

Would you accept this FWB offer? I'm still in shock, so I need your help to figure out if I should do this or not. If you need clarity, ask questions, I'm ok with this. Again, I mark this as [serious]","I have been helping a friend, 27 (NB, AMAB. This is relevant, I promise) with a few issues. Long story short; thanks to me, they still have relationships with their brother, farther, and are now engaged.

So, here's where things begin. 

After our DnD session we got to having our weekly chat where I help them with life's problems. I'm looked upon as ""the wise one who knows things"". Because, to be fair... I usually am. I've helped people from 18 to 108 with things from relationship advice, all the way to how to sue a landlord... Like I say... I know things.

They asked me, ""How did you know what to do? Everything you told me to do over the last few weeks has worked!""

For clarity; I gave them advice that helped them get engaged, fixed their relationships with their brother, and father, and I gave them some business advice that worked.

[Me (pic relevant)](https://imgur.com/a/B2EV4XA): ""I'm twice your age, honey. I've had twice your lifetime to learn things.""

Not realising I was serious, they asked: ""No, really... how do you do it? How do you know so much?""

""Well,"" I responded, ""I'm not twice your age. I'm just short of that. And... I'm proud of you. You're barely over half my age and you own a house, business, and you're engaged. It's me that should be asking you for help.""

They looked confused and asked ""what?!"" Continuing with, ""Erm, I know you never ask a woman her age. But... how old are you?!""

""Guess?"" I asked, smiling. Now... take a moment dear reader and go check that relevant pic, above. Then, guess my age... I've been told 65 before now, so.... good luck.

""Like thirty-six?"" They tentatively ask. (I've had 32-36 from a few people this month. so... I'm starting to think... maybe they ain't lying???)

I say to them, ""let me show you a pic of me three years ago."" I then showed them [this pic](https://imgur.com/a/me-grrmOmO), and asked, ""how old do you think now?""

They looked surprised. So I simply added, with a smile, ""Oestrogen is one hell of a drug."" (Although, apart from losing a beard, I see no difference. \[serious\])

""Yeah,"" they said, "" maybe I should try it. If it gets rid of the beard, maybe I'd be able to hit on you! Oh, shit. sorry, I forgot you're lesbian!"" (Note: oestrogen does not remove beards.)

""Well,"" I replied, ""You're NB, so you can get E. And I wouldn't say no to you.""

They looked confused. So I explained, ""you know how I say I'm lesbian?... it's just so I don't have to keep explaining what [finsexual](https://queerdom.fandom.com/wiki/Finsexual) means to people when I say I'm finsexual... like... how I have to now because of that look you're giving me. Basically it's pansexual, but I prefer feminine people 99.9% of the time. It's souls, not holes for me. And, you're a feminine presenting NB. sooooo..... Nothings out of the question."" I said this jokingly, thinking that this would be the end of it...

Then they pipe up with: ""You know I'm Bi, poly, and in an open relationship. I did tell you this. He's (NB AFAB) ok with me having other people, as long as he can watch.""

I, instinctively, in a knee-jerk reaction say, ""Buy me a coffee, and we can all talk about this like equals.."" I said this because my humour is dirty-minded and I expected them to back down. I mean, I still have....you know?... The birth defect is still there. So I thought that would be off-putting. But... no.

They respond, deadpan \[seriously\] with. ""Ok. Deal.""

\------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I (44 transfem, finsexual) might just have secured a FWB, (27 NB, BI) If I decide, and it's a BIG ""if"", I decide to go ahead with this. 

OK. so.... erm... what would you do? Go for it? Not? Why/why not? Help me figure this out, please?

cliff notes: They're a full grown adult who owns their own house and business. They would know EXACTLY what they were getting into because we'd talk beforehand. But... like... I don't know. 

Most of me is screaming ""FUCKING NO, you fucking cougar!""... But a part of me is saying, ""They are a fully grown adult who is wise enough to own their own house & business, and they're on track to do both these things again in the next few years. They know what they're getting into.""

So... what the fuck is this fucked up situation?!?!? Would you take the opportunity?

We don‚Äôt have much money but it seems I control all the money/bills because if not we literally would be broke. He is awful with money and I‚Äôve started to think about making he give me all his money and letting him have an allowance each week. We agreed on paying half each (even tho I don‚Äôt work full time) and recently I‚Äôve looked through my bank account to realise he has some months only sent me ¬£200! Our outgoings (everything included) are around 2k per month. I‚Äôm really thrifty, shopping all the deals, charity shops, Vinted, eBay etc. and sometimes deny myself a coffee or treats when I‚Äôm out in fear I won‚Äôt pay the next bill‚Ä¶ I asked him where his money goes after realising above and he said he just spends his money on ‚Äúshit‚Äù to which I discovered he was spending around ¬£15 per day on lunch from garages/shops when he‚Äôs out at work (around ¬£400 per month). This annoyed me as I regularly buy food for him to take to work which most of the time gets wasted (and now I see why) it‚Äôs upset me because I try to be really good with money and since having babies but it seems I‚Äôm missing out and he‚Äôs doing what he wants when he wants. 
He‚Äôs always in and out of jobs and says this is the reason he can‚Äôt always pay me as he‚Äôs waiting for the next paycheck. He‚Äôs recently started a new business but it‚Äôs only taking up 2 days per week (until he builds up clients) so he finds odd jobs to fill in the other 3 days. 
It‚Äôs been a difficult shift from myself earning ¬£40k+ per year to just ¬£12k since having babies but dealing with his awful spending habits is making it all harder. My savings are almost none and I have credit card debt because I‚Äôve had to ‚Äúfind money‚Äù some months just to make it by ‚Ä¶I wish I‚Äôd looked into it all earlier but there‚Äôs no much I can do about it now but what can I do going forwards ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried talking to him but he just says I‚Äôm ‚Äúarguing‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt want to or just keeps saying he‚Äôs trying his best. 
My current feelings are that I may as well do it all alone as I‚Äôm basically doing that anyway and I wouldn‚Äôt have to make up for his crappy spending habits. It‚Äôs hard to walk away with two young babies but he also won‚Äôt leave.

I am a 25F and my roommate is a 40F. I‚Äôm so sorry this is so long and all over the place. I want to type this out so I have it all organized. I met my current roommate through a listing that she had posted on Facebook marketplace and I responded because it said ‚Äúfemale roommate wanted, must love dogs‚Äù. We talked on the phone, I give her references, we meet, everything‚Äôs great and dandy. Until it wasn‚Äôt. She gradually has gotten more and more controlling and to where she tries to gaslight me. She is disabled and is sometimes in a wheelchair because she has something called Transverse Myelitis. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard for her to move around and she will ‚Äúgo spastic‚Äù and literally freeze up. She‚Äôs on 15 different medications, including narcotics, and is, to me, mentally unstable. 

When I‚Äôm out with my friends or family, she‚Äôs constantly blowing up my phone wondering when I‚Äôll be back or if she can come meet us or if they want to meet her out somewhere for dinner or coffee (which where is she getting the money, because she‚Äôs on disability and only makes $900 a month). One instance, I was helping my friend move into an apartment and told her I would be gone for a few hours. She calls me an hour in, saying that her 18 year old daucshund is having seizures and she can‚Äôt put her down so could I please come home and feed and let out her and my own dogs. (She has 6 dogs, I have 2, mind you) I told her I‚Äôd try but we were in the middle of setting up a bed and there was food in the oven. She immediately gave me attitude and told me to ‚Äúbe back as soon as possible‚Äù. Every time I‚Äôm out with my friends and don‚Äôt answer her or answer her and have even a slightly annoyed tone, she immediately goes into attitude mode and gets mad because I‚Äôm out with friends and not with her. 

There was a time not long ago, maybe two weeks ago, when my car was broken down and me and my dogs were staying at my parents house. I had had to have my parents come get me and act like it was a surprise because I was scared she was going to be mad that they were taking me car shopping. The day before I left, I did a lot of things around the house so that the blow of me being gone for a while wouldn‚Äôt be as bad. She texted me thanking me for all the work I did around the house and then promptly told me (after she had just had attitude on the phone with me about me being at my parents house) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre having fun at your parents house! I was so confused what was going on‚Ä¶. Please don‚Äôt leave me!‚Äù 

I work two jobs and once, wasn‚Äôt home except to sleep for 4 days and admittedly, I do understand why she was angry that time because she had to feed and let my dogs out but every other time I‚Äôm out of the house, I shouldn‚Äôt be scared to tell her it‚Äôll be a while before I‚Äôm coming home or I‚Äôm not coming home at all, like if I‚Äôm spending the night at my parent‚Äôs house. Even when I have my dogs with me, she‚Äôs pissed because ‚Äúthere‚Äôs stuff that needs to be done around the house‚Äù. The ‚Äústuff‚Äù is her mess and her laundry and dishes that need to be done. I‚Äôm never home enough to be able to make dishes messy and I do my own laundry as soon as my hamper gets full. 

I didn‚Äôt realize it had gotten to such an extent until I realized that I was scared to tell her that I was spending the night at my parents house with the dogs again and I was scared of her reaction. I‚Äôm extremely worried about she‚Äôs going to react when I move out and if she‚Äôll go ballistic on me. She‚Äôs already tried to get me into a car that has a higher car payment that I can‚Äôt afford because she knows it will keep me tied down there with her and not able to get my own place. 

Another instance, she got mad at me when I wouldn‚Äôt put pain relieving cream on her back and she gets mad when I won‚Äôt go get various things, such as water from the kitchen, pain pills, her purse, etc. 

Sorry for all the word vomit and there‚Äôs more to it than this, but this is what I could think off the top of my head and while I‚Äôm on my short break.

And oh yeah, she regularly refers to me as her sister when I‚Äôm clearly not. She genuinely believes that we‚Äôre like sisters or soulmates or something ",1,1731457658.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

Ok so for background/context on Baily and I.....  
Baily has been in my life for all of her life and 21 of mine. Moms grew up best friends and stayed that way even now. I grew up in Minnesota until I was 17 and finally had the opportunity to move with my grandparents in Wiscosin. I stayed in touch with many of my friends from the cities but over time lost many of them due to petty reasons. Baily started having troubles with alcohol and other subtsances in highschool and ended up getting multiple charges and went through quite a lot with her family and herself until about a year ago. She really started to get on the straight and narrow and do what she had to do. Because of seeing people in my life growing up have issues with alcohol in specific as well as messing up the first year of our daughters life, I chose not to drink and am sober of alcohol. That is important.

Ok now for my husband...

My husband (22) and I have been together for 6 years and married for 2. We were young and dumb and I got pregnant a little over a month into our relationship. He struggled with the bad M word (that is what I call it but i think we all know what substance that might be-(He said some call it Math??)) he got sober about a month before we met but clearly he had other stuff. Many years people told me to leave him and I deserve better. I do dont get me wrong but thats a big thing he has been working on. Nobody wants to take on a project man but it just so happens that I fell in love with him. Between years of therapy and trying medication we have gotten diagnosis that have always made sense to me but were clearly shockers to him. Most of his providers believe to be IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder). Cut to 5 years later and he knows all my family and friends obviously, which includes Baily and they all know how hard he has worked on himself for myself and our daughter.

Alright and now the story...

In September we allowed Baily to move in with us since we have been doing fairly good the past 2 years. Our home life was more stable than it had ever been, we were both working jobs and our daughter had started school. Baily had also had a really good plan with her probation officer and had really good goals in place with motivation rolling. So we had no reason to say no. Thursday my husband and I both had off of work and drove up to MN to go get Baily. All went ok getting her stuff into our car and we started our 3 hour dive back to WI. About 20 minutes in Baily ""needed"" to stop to get drinks in order to ""survive this trip"". We stopped and she got 3 tall boy Twisted Teas. 2 hours after we stopped... only 45 minutes left to our trip she needed to stop to get more drinks. She walks out with 3 more tall boys and we continue on with our drive. We arrive home and unpack the car and get her room all arranged. I had a couple bags of move in / welcome gifts ready for her to open because clearly I was so exited for us all to be together. 2 red dresses that were very much her taste, fuzzy slippers with studs on them and a couple other things, one being a package of tall boots that had not arrived yet.

\*\*\*\*Important Note: This was our county fair weekend which started on Wednesday. Its a pretty big deal in our area and most people go every night. The entire fair grounds is ALCOHOL FREE

Oh.... but not before stopping at the Kwik Trip to get her 4 more tall boy Twisted Teas.... Mind you am still not worried about the drinking at this point. My brain was justifying this as ""she just up and moved her whole life to another state, I would want a couple drinks if I had been through what she had"". My husband however was already a little suspicious. telling me ""hey thats her 6th..."" and stuff like that.

**FRIDAY MORNING!!!**¬†I get to work and day goes well. Most businesses in town let employees have a paid half day to go to the fair with their kids so natually off I went to collect our daughter from school and head home to get ready for the fair. Baily was home doing nails and makeup getting ready and my husband got home from work about 30 minutes after I did. He walked in with a Kwik Trip bag and you know what it is already. 4 tall boy Twisted Teas. Baily texted him asking him to pick them up for her to ""survive the fair night"" and its ""bullshit they dont let alcohol in"" ""I thought this was Wisconsin"" and on.

So as we watched Baily pour these drinks into a big Bubba water bottle and stuck the other two in her purse. By the time we got back into town (10 minute drive) she needed to stop to grab 2 drinks. Out I walk this time with 2 more tall boys. I am still not worried with Bailys drinking and start now saying ""she just wants to have fun"" ""she has never been to anything like this"" along woth continuing the ""she just lost everything she knew"" narrative.

Looking back I feel so bad I didnt listen to my husband especially as this story goes along. Through the night he continued to express his concerns. Escpecially with his improved relationships with the Sherrifs and PD's over the past couple years. Like I said he has worked so hard and even made ammends through our relationship to the law enforcment who delt with him as a teenager so I could see why it made him nervous / upset. We ended up leaving after the grandstand event (tractor pulls) at 9:00 and stopped at... you guessed it.... Kwik Trip for more drinks. Baily walked out with 4 more tall boy Twisted Teas and we headed home. Our dughter was already asleep so the 3 of us watched Blended (Adam Sandler movie)

**Saturday... The best day of the fair - Demo Derby**

We wake up and I noticed 2 of the Twisted Teas were still in the fridge from last night. We eat and because it is sleepover night for our daughter at my grandparents we drop her off around 10:00AM and go back home to clean until for time. My grandma and daughter go to the fair for the day and the 3 of us head to the fair around 3:00 since we got most of the cleaning done. Its Demo Derby night at the fair which is the best. Before we leave when the hair and makeup is all done and my husband is rushing us to get out the door, I fill my iced coffee and suck down a couple sips to refill for the car to have maximum caffeine affect and and I hear ""were gonna stop at Kwik Trip for some drinks right because im not going if I cant have my drinks."" 

My husband shoots me the fastest glare. Baily had drank the last 2 drinks while we were cleaning.... So we stop... She goes in.... Out comes a bag with 4 tall boy Twisted Teas. She pours 2 into the Bubba and the other two go in her bag. I swear it was like I was in a movie. I looked up at my husband and it hit me. She never stopped drinking... if she did... its not stopping now...

We get to the fair around 3:45 ate mini doughnuts and all the goodies. Say hi to all the people on our walk around the fair (its really small you its eat, ride, walk, new drink, eat, ride, walk) and before we know it its 6:00 and Baily is out. Im talking out out. Like slurping on the Bubba trying to get every last sip out. We head to the car to refill with her last two drinks because Demo Derby starts at 7:00.

by 7:30 Baily is plastered. Drunk. Heavily intoxicated. She is walking herself to the car but not without being suspisous af about it. I was already thinking about how to handle this when we get home. How do I tone her down? Calm her down? Stopped at the Kwik Trip and got 4 more.... I am scared. We get home though and I offer to play a card game. My husband doesnt play card games but his friend well call him Lane was spending the night too for a bonfire and a couple beers with my husband so he joined in as he could tell it was needed for mood lightener on the rest of us.

We started with a game of speed. Wrong choice. We got through 2 rounds and after my cards ended up in Baily's mouth along with her just being a little too ""mean"" with the cards I had remembered that she loved Garbage and played it when she was is jail that one week a couple years ago. Garbage is slower and not as intense. My playing cards got bit again. Like put in her mouth and bit. I leaned into her and lowered my voice because at that time Lane and my husband were having their own little conversation. I said very calmly ""Hey you gotta tone it down a little bit. Im getting pretty anxious and I know your a fun drunk and all"" To which Baily very sharply responded to with ""Im not drunk!!!""

 Lane and my husband looked over at us but hubby got the hint and continued his cconversation. I stay leaned in and say ""Girl you know especially with my mom like our moms like I know what drunk versus buzzed is. Its ok to be drunk right now I just need you to tone it down like a little bit because im pretty anxious"". Baily very quickly got up said : Fuck that I am not fucking drunk and im not going to let some sober sally tell me whos drunk...."" mumbled on as she walked to the fridge and came back to crack another tall boy and proceeds to chug half of it right infront of us. The boys... Shocked... Still sober...looked at me. I wear the fucking pants in the house so I was suppposed to know what to do in this situation I guess.

I said "" No no its ok Im sorry im just going to go up to bed. Its like my bed time anyways"" with a little chuckle. My husband walked right over to me and walked me upstairs while she mumbled under her breath things about me saying shes drunk and whatnot. It is 10:30 PM so it really isnt that late. I mean I was tired dont get me wrong but I was looking forward to a fun night. We talked in bed for a couple minutes. I saw where he was coming from and I apologized I brushed it off. He thanked me for handling it well and asked if I really did want to go to bed. I told him I did because he knows I will sleep anywhere anytime and it was late for me. We made a plan to talk to her Sunday morning (next morning) about the drinking before we got our daughter from my grandparents. About 20 minutes later he went downstairs and made the bonfire and him, Lane and Baily chilled outside.

Around midnight I woke up with a dry ass mouth and a need for a ball of crushed, balled up white bread. I text my husband and ask for those two things. I heard him walk in the house and come upstairs with my things, sat down and asked if I was ok. I was passed tf out so yea I'm fantastic. I ask him the same. He was annoyed because him and Lane hadnt been able to have any of the Busch Lattes yet because they were essentially babysitting Baily. I wished him luck and offered to help get her to bed and he said ""nah"" hes ""got it, like a big boy.""

**1:35AM**¬†Hubby comes in worried somethings going to happen with Baily. Im asleep. Like I barley remember this I just remember him asking for advice like how others would handle her in the past. She was arguing about something with the alcohol.

**1:41AM**¬†was the time I looked at my phone.

I assume she busted my door down not even 2 minutes before this.

Screaming about how her and my husband had slept together 4 times and something about the color purple. I immediatly go to the car to leave. Like i just get downstairs and grab my keys and walk outside. Baily was trying to block me from my garage door to get into the garage. Pull out of the garage and I dont have my phone. I get out and as my husband is standing next to me following me inside to get my phone Baily full on tackles. And im talking NFL takedown or whatever. my husband. He doesnt hit the ground he knows how to handle his weight especially growing up with 4 brothers doing that same move. I saw him essentially pry her off him and I continue to walk inside to grab my phone. 

I hear Lane on the phone with the cops at this point and now I know I have to go more than ever. I walk back to the car and as my husband is blocking Baily from getting to my drivers door I see her rip his shirt right off him. Like she ran infront of him and with her full might ripped his shirt right off him. Looking back it was crazy funny that I saw something straight out of a movie. I drive away. I go to my grandparents 30 minutes away where my daughter is. I turned off my phone and I went to sleep.

Next Day

I wake up at 9:30 something. My grandma greets me with an ""are you ok?"" and I go oh he hit you up. We talked for a while and she takes my husbands side. This is a very RARE thing for her.

He knew his past he knew what was at stake and he knew who he is/was. Thankfully thay know the improvements hes made in his life and how hard he has worked for his family (our daughter and I).

He had been turning her down and telling her we arnt going to let her move in and he will tell me what she is saying and I am her best friend and how could she. On and On. For 3 months.

\*\*\*Note: I do not discount his part in this. We have had our talks and have made our peace and have celebrated his honesty. He did the wrong this by not telling me and allowing me to let her move in. I wear the pants and really whatever I say went but if he wouldn't have hid it we wouldnt have gone throguh this. Hes lucky they got the screenshots.

I went to talk to my husband the next day but Bailys dad came down that night to grab as much of her stuff as possible. I gave Baily hugs and kept my mouth shut. I said by and gave her another hug. She wanted them and I cant say no... thats my best friend. I dont know why she would lie to me. Even if its the alcohol.

I got them for her though and I would feel so bad to just not have them in her pile of stuff when someone comes back to get it.

","Yeah. I've been done with this company for a while now. If it weren't for my coworkers being so cool there's no way I would have been here for three years. After my SM initially recommended I sign up for the Coffee Master training it took a year of reminding him before I got scheduled for the first bit of it. A year later and I just need to do a taste testing and still can't get management to schedule that. Every PDC I've said ""Can I get longer shifts?"" in response to the SM asking what they can do for me (along with asking at other times) and got nothing until a week ago. On one occasion the answer I got was that it would be ""too inconvenient"", not ""it's not in the budget"" or ""I don't schedule openers to be here past peak"", nope, just an inconvenience to write the schedule a little different. But wow, that's not even the bit that gets me the most. No, it's the fact that this company ""appreciates"" its employees so much that in lieu of holiday bonuses they give out 5-6 shares of stock, none of which you receive that same year, half the next year and the other half on the third year, oh but wait, the taxes get taken upon receiving them and not when you sell! So those 3 stocks you just got are getting hit with a 33.9% tax apparently and oop, they have to round up, here's your 1 share of starbucks stock that you get to keep. btw it has no voting privileges. And that's just... wow. That's the method they picked? Distributing 3 shares so that you lose 2 before even getting them? Yeah. I'm glad I found another job where management seems to care noticeably more and is willing to invest in training employees. It's another barista position and I'm going to be trained on roasting, the manager has also gone over bean orders and where she sources from and all that because she knows that I'm interested.",3,1731457291.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

To begin, things started out great in the relationship when the two of us started dating. As things have proceeded, there isn't really much I would say was wrong in the relationship though it continued at a speed where the two of us ended up talking about things and spending time together. She has this method of talking about things that are very round about in terms of the subject material we may be talking about. The two of us have been to see a movie. I think in the spring the two of us may go to see a baseball game together, I wouldn't go without her. It is just complicated because as finals are approaching it is like we are talking about us dating though neither of us has really made strides in us doing anything aside from staying over at each other's places and study dates. Today we sat at the library for a good six hours while I got things done, she had some stuff to do too though by the time we were ready to go I am pretty sure she was just shopping on her laptop. I'm not even finished yet, so tomorrow we both may be doing something similar. To be open about things I really like our time together, and she could have up and bailed at any time saying she will just meet me at home when I am donethough she stayed in like a champ. It may just be a slow process to really see us get there in terms of each other when study dates appear to be occupying our time as of late. I set some time aside to prepare some ice coffee last night, so we had a bit of something to sip on while studying though she prefers matcha. It may be that is our next store run. I probably have notes to review tonight, and may be looking through things while we watch her favorite shows. I am pretty indifferent to the stuff we watch though occasionally a show does peak my interest. 

TL;DR My girlfriend and I of a year like going on dates though it is like lately all we have been doing is staying over at each other's places and having study dates. They are fun and personally I appreciate our time with each other though sometimes a change of speeds in the relationship would probably be appreciated. At this point in time there isn't much to be done, though mixing it up would be nice. We usually study in her or my room for reference.

I'm coming from a background of having owned a winery and having distilled wine for brandy, so I'm, let's say, very familiar with that side of things - enough so that I have a difficult time figuring out how herbalists that make tinctures, get their alcohol.

[organicalcohol.com](http://organicalcohol.com)  has plenty of alcohol one can use, yeah that's great, but...is that what people do?  Buy in bulk somewhere like that?  Or...buy bulk brandy from a winery, or vodka from a distillery?  I ask because those things would feel like (having had a license...) they would need you to have a license to purchase, since people with licenses have limits and restrictions on how alcohol can be sold.

I say this as a person who had worked to have a safe community space - that happened to sell wine, but not as the primary purpose - and more and more saw how alcohol isn't used...well...by people, and have now sworn it off myself and closed up shop.  I'd like to open a tea/coffee/herbs spot that sells tinctures, and I'd like to start making the tinctures soon so they have time to age.  I actually have a lot of brandy still, but I would have to track to both the state and federal government where that brandy goes.

So what do people do?  Just go buy large bottles of vodka at Costco?  It seems there's just a ""we're going to close our eyes"" situation on how they don't consider tinctures to be alcohol, but they also don't seem to...care...where the alcohol came from that is used, yet it requires very strict state and local licenses to distill alcohol, and said alcohol is tracked and is bottled in ways that generally prohibit secondary resale (ie, they're for consumers only).

I thought it was because I've become picky since my ex of 4 years (also baby daddy). No guy has ""done it"" for me on all levels. The physical has definitely been there, but emotionally it always falls short. 

  
I went to go on a coffee date with a guy recently, and there was a girl standing outside the shop that gave me a very long flirty look. She was cute, wearing a cap and had tomboy vibes. I went to meet the guy but I sat there on the date thinking about the girl outside and how she gave me tingles. The guy was so vanilla in comparison - although he was handsome and all that he just didn't do anything for me. 

  
So after thinking about it some more, I decided to try talking to women on the apps to see what I felt. This exploration has kind of unlocked a new part of my brain that was never online before. I immediately felt like a lot of things in the world made sense all of a sudden. I have been so conditioned into thinking I should be with a man that I don't think I've even allowed myself to look at girls. But now I feel like the opposite problem is true: I have the emotional connection, but not sure about the physical - I just don't have the experience to say. I went on my first coffee date with a girl. Another tomboy-ish vibe: no makeup, short hair and tattoos. I was definitely attracted to her. But is it because she looks more like a guy than a girl?

Ok so for background/context on Baily and I.....  
Baily has been in my life for all of her life and 21 of mine. Moms grew up best friends and stayed that way even now. I grew up in Minnesota until I was 17 and finally had the opportunity to move with my grandparents in Wiscosin. I stayed in touch with many of my friends from the cities but over time lost many of them due to petty reasons. Baily started having troubles with alcohol and other subtsances in highschool and ended up getting multiple charges and went through quite a lot with her family and herself until about a year ago. She really started to get on the straight and narrow and do what she had to do. Because of seeing people in my life growing up have issues with alcohol in specific as well as messing up the first year of our daughters life, I chose not to drink and am sober of alcohol. That is important.

Ok now for my husband...

My husband (22) and I have been together for 6 years and married for 2. We were young and dumb and I got pregnant a little over a month into our relationship. He struggled with the bad M word (that is what I call it but i think we all know what substance that might be-(He said some call it Math??)) he got sober about a month before we met but clearly he had other stuff. Many years people told me to leave him and I deserve better. I do dont get me wrong but thats a big thing he has been working on. Nobody wants to take on a project man but it just so happens that I fell in love with him. Between years of therapy and trying medication we have gotten diagnosis that have always made sense to me but were clearly shockers to him. Most of his providers believe to be IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder). Cut to 5 years later and he knows all my family and friends obviously, which includes Baily and they all know how hard he has worked on himself for myself and our daughter.

Alright and now the story...

In September we allowed Baily to move in with us since we have been doing fairly good the past 2 years. Our home life was more stable than it had ever been, we were both working jobs and our daughter had started school. Baily had also had a really good plan with her probation officer and had really good goals in place with motivation rolling. So we had no reason to say no. Thursday my husband and I both had off of work and drove up to MN to go get Baily. All went ok getting her stuff into our car and we started our 3 hour dive back to WI. About 20 minutes in Baily ""needed"" to stop to get drinks in order to ""survive this trip"". We stopped and she got 3 tall boy Twisted Teas. 2 hours after we stopped... only 45 minutes left to our trip she needed to stop to get more drinks. She walks out with 3 more tall boys and we continue on with our drive. We arrive home and unpack the car and get her room all arranged. I had a couple bags of move in / welcome gifts ready for her to open because clearly I was so exited for us all to be together. 2 red dresses that were very much her taste, fuzzy slippers with studs on them and a couple other things, one being a package of tall boots that had not arrived yet.

\*\*\*\*Important Note: This was our county fair weekend which started on Wednesday. Its a pretty big deal in our area and most people go every night. The entire fair grounds is ALCOHOL FREE

Oh.... but not before stopping at the Kwik Trip to get her 4 more tall boy Twisted Teas.... Mind you am still not worried about the drinking at this point. My brain was justifying this as ""she just up and moved her whole life to another state, I would want a couple drinks if I had been through what she had"". My husband however was already a little suspicious. telling me ""hey thats her 6th..."" and stuff like that.

**FRIDAY MORNING!!!**¬†I get to work and day goes well. Most businesses in town let employees have a paid half day to go to the fair with their kids so natually off I went to collect our daughter from school and head home to get ready for the fair. Baily was home doing nails and makeup getting ready and my husband got home from work about 30 minutes after I did. He walked in with a Kwik Trip bag and you know what it is already. 4 tall boy Twisted Teas. Baily texted him asking him to pick them up for her to ""survive the fair night"" and its ""bullshit they dont let alcohol in"" ""I thought this was Wisconsin"" and on. So as we watched Baily pour these drinks into a big Bubba water bottle and stuck the other two in her purse. By the time we got back into town (10 minute drive) she needed to stop to grab 2 drinks. Out I walk this time with 2 more tall boys. I am still not worried with Bailys drinking and start now saying ""she just wants to have fun"" ""she has never been to anything like this"" along woth continuing the ""she just lost everything she knew"" narrative. Looking back I feel so bad I didnt listen to my husband especially as this story goes along. Through the night he continued to express his concerns. Escpecially with his improved relationships with the Sherrifs and PD's over the past couple years. Like I said he has worked so hard and even made ammends through our relationship to the law enforcment who delt with him as a teenager so I could see why it made him nervous / upset. We ended up leaving after the grandstand event (tractor pulls) at 9:00 and stopped at... you guessed it.... Kwik Trip for more drinks. Baily walked out with 4 more tall boy Twisted Teas and we headed home. Our dughter was already asleep so the 3 of us watched Blended (Adam Sandler movie)

**Saturday... The best day of the fair - Demo Derby**

We wake up and I noticed 2 of the Twisted Teas were still in the fridge from last night. We eat and because it is sleepover night for our daughter at my grandparents we drop her off around 10:00AM and go back home to clean until for time. My grandma and daughter go to the fair for the day and the 3 of us head to the fair around 3:00 since we got most of the cleaning done. Its Demo Derby night at the fair which is the best. Before we leave when the hair and makeup is all done and my husband is rushing us to get out the door, I fill my iced coffee and suck down a couple sips to refill for the car to have maximum caffeine affect and and I hear ""were gonna stop at Kwik Trip for some drinks right because im not going if I cant have my drinks."" My husband shoots me the fastest glare. Baily had drank the last 2 drinks while we were cleaning.... So we stop... She goes in.... Out comes a bag with 4 tall boy Twisted Teas. She pours 2 into the Bubba and the other two go in her bag. I swear it was like I was in a movie. I looked up at my husband and it hit me. She never stopped drinking... if she did... its not stopping now...

We get to the fair around 3:45 ate mini doughnuts and all the goodies. Say hi to all the people on our walk around the fair (its really small you its eat, ride, walk, new drink, eat, ride, walk) and before we know it its 6:00 and Baily is out. Im talking out out. Like slurping on the Bubba trying to get every last sip out. We head to the car to refill with her last two drinks because Demo Derby starts at 7:00.

by 7:30 Baily is plastered. Drunk. Heavily intoxicated. She is walking herself to the car but not without being suspisous af about it. I was already thinking about how to handle this when we get home. How do I tone her down? Calm her down? Stopped at the Kwik Trip and got 4 more.... I am scared. We get home though and I offer to play a card game. My husband doesnt play card games but his friend well call him Lane was spending the night too for a bonfire and a couple beers with my husband so he joined in as he could tell it was needed for mood lightener on the rest of us. We started with a game of speed. Wrong choice. We got through 2 rounds and after my cards ended up in Baily's mouth along with her just being a little too ""mean"" with the cards I had remembered that she loved Garbage and played it when she was is jail that one week a couple years ago. Garbage is slower and not as intense. My playing cards got bit again. Like put in her mouth and bit. I leaned into her and lowered my voice because at that time Lane and my husband were having their own little conversation. I said very calmly ""Hey you gotta tone it down a little bit. Im getting pretty anxious and I know your a fun drunk and all"" To which Baily very sharply responded to with ""Im not drunk!!!"" Lane and my husband looked over at us but hubby got the hint and continued his cconversation. I stay leaned in and say ""Girl you know especially with my mom like our moms like I know what drunk versus buzzed is. Its ok to be drunk right now I just need you to tone it down like a little bit because im pretty anxious"". Baily very quickly got up said : Fuck that I am not fucking drunk and im not going to let some sober sally tell me whos drunk...."" mumbled on as she walked to the fridge and came back to crack another tall boy and proceeds to chug half of it right infront of us. The boys... Shocked... Still sober...looked at me. I wear the fucking pants in the house so I was suppposed to know what to do in this situation I guess. I said "" No no its ok Im sorry im just going to go up to bed. Its like my bed time anyways"" with a little chuckle. My husband walked right over to me and walked me upstairs while she mumbled under her breath things about me saying shes drunk and whatnot. It is 10:30 PM so it really isnt that late. I mean I was tired dont get me wrong but I was looking forward to a fun night. We talked in bed for a couple minutes. I saw where he was coming from and I apologized I brushed it off.

These cops are literally psychic‚Äîthey‚Äôll chase you to the ends of the map. I tried hiding out in the woods, just laying low, and these dudes roll up with infrared goggles and body armor like I‚Äôm in some action movie. And they‚Äôre even worse in online mode; it‚Äôs like they can SMELL fun and just show up to ruin it.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on the NPCs. I‚Äôm walking down the street, and suddenly there‚Äôs MoistCr1TiKaL just standing there, greasy hair and all, saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm looking for, baby!‚Äù every time I mess up a mission. It‚Äôs funny, like, ONCE, but after the tenth time he roasts me, I started avoiding half the city just to avoid his whiny voice. Then there‚Äôs Tony Hawk, who‚Äôs just skating around randomly? Like, you‚Äôll be in the middle of a police chase, and Tony‚Äôs there doing an ollie off a fire hydrant for no reason. Rockstar doesn‚Äôt explain it, he‚Äôs just THERE, skating around like Los Santos is his playground.

And bro, the Mount Chiliad mystery? Total scam. You spend HOURS following clues and doing all this crazy stuff, thinking it‚Äôs gonna be aliens or some secret base, and it‚Äôs just some cave with old wall drawings that say, ‚ÄúThe real treasure was the journey‚Äù or some cringe crap like that. I was like, bro, are you serious? This is what we waited a decade for? Some cave graffiti about ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù? I thought we‚Äôd at least get Bigfoot or an alien gun or something cool. Instead, there‚Äôs just this NPC tour guide saying stuff like, ‚ÄúLook how far you‚Äôve come for self-discovery!‚Äù I wanted to delete the game right there.

And multiplayer? Don‚Äôt even bother. They added this ‚ÄúReal Estate Tycoon‚Äù thing where you can buy property, but good luck with that unless you want to grind out deliveries for three real-life months or drop $50 on a shark card. Meanwhile, you‚Äôve got twelve-year-olds flying around in golden jets, buying out the city, while you‚Äôre stuck driving a beater. Hackers are EVERYWHERE, too. I got on, and some dude just turned my car into a bouncy house. It‚Äôs like Rockstar doesn‚Äôt even care about mods or hackers anymore, and every server has some dude in god mode trolling everyone.

Oh, and now there‚Äôs these new ‚Äúlife stats‚Äù you have to manage. Like, you actually have to eat, sleep, and de-stress, or else your character starts slowing down or even passes out mid-mission. I was literally doing a heist, and my guy just FAINTS because he hadn‚Äôt slept enough. And if you skip too much sleep, there‚Äôs an in-game therapist who calls you out, saying you need ‚Äúwork-life balance‚Äù like Rockstar is my mom or something. Like, I play GTA to ESCAPE life, not live it.

IDK what Rockstar was thinking, but this whole game feels like a prank on the players.",7,1731456894.0,GTA7,2,1.0,False

First of all: I'm sorry for my really basic English, I'm German. :-) Some specific topics are difficult for me to express. I hope you will understand it. 2nd: Thank you for this group and all the good tips and advice many of you are sharing here. So: I'm on Fansly for a few years now. Just started over on Loyalfans. And I have also aready been on ManyVids before, then deleted everything bc I was a little bit overwhelmed. But I really like the friendly support team and the tolerant vibe and kink friendly people there. Now my ""problem"": I'm very used to those platforms like Fansly where you can just post everything together one ONE place / wall timeline. Texts, photos, videos - long videos, very short clips,... I a chronical order, just along the day, kind of a ""spicy diary"". Example: I the morning I share my morning coffee and post it along witg a goodmorning text ect. Later maybe a little cleavage / flash teaser at the supermarket... That's not possible on MV. The zip photo item thing is too complicated for me, so no photo possibility. Videos have to be at least one min. So NO chance for a 20 sec short flash in between. For that I could use the ""wall"". But I think you just can post very small clips there...  So the content would be on kind of different places... I like the idea just to post everything in a ""time"" order, it's more authentic and personal - just like my life is. Or maybe ONLY upload longer videos and just use it more impersonal - like a clip store? That woul be WAY less work, but also not that real... I'm thinking back and forth... Maybe really just ignore the wall (the only way I would use it for short updates and then post my shorter clips, but on Loyalfans and Fansly they are begind a paywall. So I don't want to post a 35 sec full nude or pee clip for free. So it's impossible bc it's too short for the video section there. And always think about which clips you could crop together.... When they are so different... Complicated. XD How would you use manyvids? ",1,1731456837.0,CreatorsAdvice,1,1.0,False

Current Eastern Caribbean PCV since June ‚Äò23 dropping some random packing advice to anyone considering an invitation right now.

I agonized over packing and want to be helpful to those who come after me. I feel like so much of the advice I looked for was conflicting!! I feel like I never read anyone offer the insight I currently have as a volunteer here.

This region is very well stocked and you can easily attain almost anything you want/ need here. However, many things are extremely expensive and unrealistic for a PCV to spend money on. I have an extremely random list of things you will regret not bringing if you don‚Äôt. Anything else I don‚Äôt mention you can easily get here.

-quality, polarized sunglasses. Y‚Äôall the sun is no joke. I never leave the house without them.

-protein powder. This is such a randomly expensive item here and I regret not bringing this.

-French press, Aeropress, etc. Most coffee drinkers in these islands drink instant coffee and you can only buy a simple coffee machine here. I brought a small Aeropress with a reusable stainless steel filter and it was the best decision I ever made lol. 

-a Roku. Your house will likely have a tv but only has channels on it.

- speaker, earbuds, chargers, battery packs etc. Electronics like this are expensive here 

- hiking shoes or boots. Personally not super important for me but for super active folk must bring

- certain skincare brands are here but verrrrry inflated in cost. If you‚Äôre loyal to certain things bring some backups. Same goes with makeup

-STICKERS. And other cute classroom stuff. Obviously this is for the literacy volunteers or any response who will be working with students. School supplies are expensive here and you will seriously miss dollar tree!

DO NOT OVERPACK EVERYTHING ELSE!!! Seriously. I personally hate clutter and I regret bringing so many ‚Äúextras‚Äù and ‚Äúbackups‚Äù for things like clothes and shoes. It‚Äôs easier to just get things here and you will need to replace things like sandals and casual clothes frequently.

I hope this is helpful. I plan on making a post about the dress standards in EC schools next because I found those guidelines so needlessly confusing especially based on what I know now being here. Best of luck to all and excited for anyone considering Eastern Caribbean!! ",4,1731456790.0,peacecorps,2,1.0,False

For some context, I‚Äôve never had good friends, and at the time, they were my only one. I don‚Äôt carry conversations at all, I never know what to say, so I just listen. Our conversation‚Äôs usually consisted of whatever was going on in their life. I shared a lot with them as well, but we would usually return to their own experiences.¬†

The week before us sitting down to play videogames was probably one of the more shittier weeks in my life. I was crying 2-3 times a day for what I now see is over basically nothing. I wasn‚Äôt going to class, I wasn‚Äôt able to hold a conversation with my mom without it ending in a huge meltdown, and I was just so exhausted with everything that life has thrown my way that I was about two seconds away from quitting my job and dropping out of university. This all came to a climax when I had to drive into school by myself for the first time and had a panic attack in my car when I couldn‚Äôt find a place to park. I was so overwhelmed that when I actually met up with them, I just sat on the stairs for 20 minutes before deciding that I needed to see the counselor for some advice to combat how I was feeling because I felt so out of control, but nothing else in life could slow down to give me room to breathe. They turned me away because they weren‚Äôt having drop-in hours that day, and I decided to just go home. It‚Äôs a 30 minute drive home, plus the 15 minutes I spent talking to my mom before I replied to them. This is important because they mention it later on when they confronted me about semi-rage-quitting.¬†

We got to sit down and play videogames about 4 days later after I came home from work on a Sunday. I was already really upset because we had two of THOSE lottery people at work and they were both regulars who like to pick on me. I told them that I had a bad day while we were getting on, and that I was really looking to relax. I‚Äôm going to be honest, I could already tell that no relaxation would come from me playing a PvP for the first time, but they constantly talk about how annoyed they are when people cancel plans or want to change them. They also do this thing where they will delegate like 2 hours to you and then 2 hours to another friend for games, so someone who I didn‚Äôt know was supposed to play with them after. Mind you, they didn‚Äôt let me know that they wanted to stay on for a set amount of time before I got on with them and had already changed the start time with my agreement.¬†

I was actually having some fun on the game, minus being just really embarrassed about how much I was dying and getting lost on the map, until we were playing a free-for-all and I had a very squishy healer as who I chose to play as. They helped me die twice out of the 4 times I died within that minute span, and I had no clue what the game mode was, or how to play my character, I just started ranting while trying to hold back my tears. I was so upset and hurt. I wasn‚Äôt ranting at them, I was just saying those usual things, like, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is going on?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stuck in a corner‚Äù ‚Äúleave me the fuck alone‚Äù(not to them, they weren‚Äôt speaking at me during this, they were commentating on who they were fighting, I was yelling at the players attacking me) and that‚Äôs when I realised I really wasn‚Äôt having fun and that what I was saying could be making them uncomfortable. They had already had some moments where they were mad while we were playing, but they never dwelled on it so I never thought that it would explode like this. When I realised that I wasn‚Äôt happy playing anymore, I took a big step back and started to explain to them that I was overwhelmed and wanted to get off because I was just getting really mad and it wasn‚Äôt good for the day. I left the Voice chat, rejoined, tried to assure them it wasn‚Äôt their fault. Waited for a response, all I got was an ‚ÄúMm.‚Äù

Okay, whatever, I messaged them later explaining again, giving them an opportunity to maybe confront me in a less face-to-face sort of way, but they never responded to that message or the ones I sent (not about me quitting but just typical stuff) for like another day or two before the morning of the confrontation. Mind you, between waiting for a response, I tried to learn the characters and the game a bit more in between by playing against AI instead of just going straight into the game. I knew they were mad about me leaving even though I didn‚Äôt outright say they were ‚Äúprobably mad‚Äù because that would sound accusatory and I really felt like it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal since I explained it and I wasn‚Äôt being a massive jerk or anything, at least I feel like, but the silent treatment was telling. When they asked to meet up with me on the morning, it seemed like they were fine, and I just told them where I was on campus. We met up, and I started to tell them that I practised a bit and understood, before trying to ask them about how they really felt about me leaving where they cut me off before I could even finish saying the character‚Äôs name I was playing.¬†

When they started yelling at me, I just stopped talking. I didn‚Äôt expect them to suddenly snap at me, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to fucking hear about that! What you did was extremely disrespectful. I could have been playing with someone else or at the library studying, but you can‚Äôt even sit through an hour of playing a game with me!‚Äù And I was just so stunned and so offended. This had nothing to do with them, and me leaving doesn‚Äôt control how they spend their time. I tried to explain, but they started to talk about how they‚Äôve been so worried about me lately and how they don‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore. I was so mad with how they were cutting me off and how they had talked to me that I just told them, ‚ÄúI think you should take your stuff and go.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to sit next to them or be near them because I could feel how angry I was getting and how frustrated I was. I power walked to the bathroom, only to find out they were following me. I locked them out of my stall and the two of us were quiet as we walked back. I didn‚Äôt have the strength to tell them to leave me alone again and I regret that so much because maybe this could have all been avoided. When we got back to the place we met at, I just grabbed my coffee and walked over to the microwave to nuke it. I was trying so hard to just put some distance between us, but they walked up to me and started up again.¬†

‚ÄúWant to tell me what the Hell this little game is? I‚Äôm not chasing you around. If you want to talk about this, then lets talk about this.‚Äù I exploded back, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the fuck you want me to say! I‚Äôm sorry I wasted your time? I‚Äôm sorry I had a bad week and needed to step back?‚Äù They tried to say that THAT wasn‚Äôt the point. They told me they felt like it was too much for them with all the ‚Äòdrama‚Äô in their life, and we had one of those stupid back and forths where they clearly thought what I was going through was nothing compared to what they were, but I genuinely felt like the point was that I had a collapse like they often have and instead of supporting me back, they just screamed at me out of nowhere in public instead of taking the two chances I gave them to not have this confrontation face-to-face. I told them then and there that I didn‚Äôt want to be friends with them anymore if they couldn‚Äôt handle me having a bad week. They said something along the lines of ‚ÄúYou want to end 5 years of friendship over a game?‚Äù¬†

Yes, and when they said they wanted to talk about this later when I was ‚Äòfeeling like an adult‚Äô but I firmly told them we wouldn‚Äôt be talking again.¬†

Of course, this wasn‚Äôt everything as they messaged me 30 minutes later when I was really not doing well demanding an apology and telling me that I didn‚Äôt mean what I said and was just angry. I just wanted to leave things on a better note, so I apologised to them. I feel really awful for how I just gave it to them without telling them how I was feeling. They told me that we would reconnect, but then called me childish again in the same paragraph and offered no apology themselves. I didn‚Äôt respond to this and unfriended them on everything I thought to, with leaving them on my game platforms just because I hadn‚Äôt gotten around to those.¬†

That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs ended, and it‚Äôs been on my mind this whole time. I feel so frustrated and like I‚Äôve been taken advantage of our whole relationship. Of course this isn‚Äôt the first time something like this has happened, but I was told by one person that I reacted too quickly, but by another that my anger‚Äôs just doing it‚Äôs job and keeping me safe. I already know just writing this that I‚Äôm not interested in reconnecting with them, but I really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being childish and not hearing their feelings. Thoughts?

---------------  
  
*""... why?""*  
  
The young woman - the *thing,* the titanium and kevlar and plastic *thing* in the shape of a young woman - side-eyes him with an utterly nonplussed stare as she continues taking a long sip from the steaming cup of coffee-flavoured sludge cradled in her gloved hands. Taking her sweet time, she slowly lowers the mug and lets out a long exhale - hot air turning to smoke in the brutal pre-dawn chill - before deigning to acknowledge his question.  
  
""Care to elaborate on that, Corporal?""  
  
""Coffee. The fuck you drink it for? Not like a droid needs caffeine to keep running.""  
  
The *look* she fixes him with is so laden with condescension that he almost has to physically restrain himself - *you're not in the field, dipshit* - from doing anything more than biting down slightly on his soggy stub of a cigarette.  
  
""I'm equipped with a digestive system that can consume solid matter to recharge my power cells and process liquids to replenish lost coolant fluid. I also possess taste sensors, which in turn transmit different signals to my core operating system depending on the substance detected.""  
  
""So what, they programmed you with a thing for coffee?"" It makes sense, he supposes, in a twisted sort of way; the more she has in common with humans, the easier it is for her to be accepted as merely another co-worker rather than an automated *thing* purchased so that some manager can pay one less paycheck.  
  
She shakes her head at that. ""I wasn't programmed with any real 'preferences' beyond a basic revulsion towards certain substances not fit for consumption. Different foods and drinks merely elicit different sensory responses, and I find the responses from consuming certain things - like coffee - more pleasant than others.""  
  
""So they *did* program you to like coffee.""  
  
""Like I said before, I wasn't programmed to 'like' any food or drink more than any other. My particular appreciation for coffee was just one of several preferences that emerged naturally after a significant amount of continuous runtime-""  
  
""Natural my ass. You were *manufactured;* your entire personality was written in ones and zeroes by some geeks in a lab-""  
  
""Actually, my core OS was almost entirely written by self-correcting algorithms, as is the norm with all other 2nd-generation dolls. The surface-level formatting was hand-tailored to fit the established requirements, but the deeper levels of my program data are too complex to be processed by human beings without an intermediary program."" She looks off into the distance, brow furrowing and eyes narrowing in a pensive expression that would be almost perfectly humanlike, were it not for their brilliant gold coloration. ""Even I couldn't effectively interpret my own programing at such a fundamental level. It would be like... Like asking a clock to explain how it keeps time. Simply impossible by its physical capabilities.""  

He can't help but scoff at this, barking a single, bitter laugh at the absurd image of a doll playing philosopher - a plastic imitation with impossibly exotic looks that could only pass for human in a Green Zone rave club, pondering the mysteries of existence.  
  
""Did I say something amusing?"" She even has the nerve to look *offended,* lips pursed and eyebrows raised in expectation.  
  
*You're a* ***thing.*** *A fucking consumer product mass-produced on a assembly line, and here you are having preferences and opinions and moments of  goddamned introspection like you're an actual human individual.* ""I just think it's hilarious how you managed to convince yourself that you're somehow... a person? Because you're not."" He crushes the dying embers of his soggy cig between his thumb and index, savoring the slight burn on his calloused fingertips. ""You're fucking *ordnance.* Mil-spec, built by the lowest bidder. You were designed and manufactured to be a weapon, and that's all you are meant to be. You don't get to be anything more than that, sweetheart. That's not how weapons work.""  
  
""And you think you're any different?""  
  
That actually gets a rise out of him, a single burst of electric fury that has him reel about on her before he can get ahold of himself. He's got a good half-head's worth of height over her, and he takes no small satisfaction in putting it to good use as he steps into her immediate circle, even as she looks up at him with that same nonplussed frown. ""I was born to a mother and a father who loved me, raised me, taught me to be a man. I've got friends I've known since childhood, guys I'd die for just as they would for me. I've got a country I've fought, bled, and killed for, by my own choice, because I believe in what it stands for. So *yeah,""* he spits out, ""I think I'm a cut above you.""  
  
She takes a step back, but it's not quite a retreat - more a reevaluation, almost assessing something as she looks him over with that same unflappable expression. ""You're a veteran, aren't you?""  
  
""Damn right. Germany, then France. More dead Americans than I could count.""  
  
""And dead Euros?""  
  
His grin is sharp with pride. ""At least twice that number.""  
  
""Not exactly convenient these days, is it?"" Now it's her turn to smile, head tilted in slight bemusement. ""Considering how you'll both be answering to the same government soon enough.""  
  
""Convenience can go suck a fat dick. Someone's got to stick around to make sure the politicians remember what our nation stands for.""  
  
""Well, it seems those politicians disagree."" She starts walking, circling him languidly as her gaze stays level. ""Your unit's normally stationed out east. No glory to be found in commanding pest control, and infantry never survives long when everything you're fighting is armored - a *dead end,* in either sense of the word. And yet, the most experienced veterans like yourself always seem to wind up posted there."" She stops circling, now standing on his opposite side from where she started. ""If I didn't know better, I'd say someone wanted you all gone.""  
  
She's close. *Too fucking close.* But he didn't survive Schwarzwald by flinching at tracers, and his poker face sure as hell won't fold to a mere doll. ""And we're not out east anymore. They wanted us, *specifically,* on this."" He half-shrugs, half-throws his arms out. ""So here we are.""  
  
""Expendables overseeing expendables. Tell me,"" she steps in, ""you know the upside to wearing gloves when you take out the trash?""  
  
She smiles up at him - not some coy half-smile, but an actual grin with *teeth* - and for the first time, he doesn't need to convince himself that she's not even remotely human. *""You throw them out with the trash and your hands stay clean.""*  
  
What the hell. *What the* ***hell-*** Instinct alone carries him through, ingrained from the schoolyard to the barracks, as he laughs in her face. ""There really is something fucked in your programing if you think we're more screwed here. Last I checked, we're not the ones deploying without any armor.""  
  
The teeth are long gone now, nothing but Mona Lisa half-smile as she takes one, two, three carefully measured steps back from him. For a moment, nothing - then one of the two segmented trapezoidal slabs of metal hanging from her waist jerks slightly, expanding outwards as its mechanical subarm raises it to the ready position. The air crackles with small bursts of electricity erupting across its surface, simmering with a slight scent of ozone; it's not *intended* to be a weapon, but surely she wouldn't-  
  
The dark spec jerks to a stop in the shield's magnetic field just as the sharp *thwip* - like a book being ripped in half along the spine - catches up with it. The smushed blob of lead, still spinning and tumbling as it floats in place, just hangs there for a moment before the electric crackle cuts out, and it falls into the doll's hand. She holds it for a moment, slowly looks up to him with deliberation, and flicks the bullet off his plate carrier.  
  
The usual hubub of the FOB carries on uninterrupted, completely unaware to the intrusion of some mercenary sniper playing batshit dominance games with their defective doll. The old poker face is still doing *wonders.* ""Congratulations. You're bulletproof. See what good that does you against artillery.""  
  
She doesn't even bother with a response, just smiles at him over her shoulder with an inexplicably smug expression as she turns and walks away, *strutting* along the side of the busy dirt road like it's a Paris catwalk, the unholy bastardization of an antique 12-gauge tube shotgun slung across her back bouncing with each step.  
  
*""Fuckin' toaster.""* He mutters to himself as he rummages through his pockets to fish out another half-crushed cigarette. The lighter takes three tries to spark right, but eventually he's rewarded with the sweet hit of nicotine.  
  
With his temper cooling back to normal, he takes a moment to assess the situation. On one hand, he should call it in. *That droid knew *something* - exactly how much she knows is debatable, but the mercs being wise to the plan at all could throw a serious wrench in things...* He exhales, blowing out smoke with a long sigh. On the other hand, this is all *far* above his paygrade. If he, a mere grunt, knows something about this, then the COs of the entire division sure as hell know about it already. No sense being that one poor idiot who gets the bright idea to remind an officer of something they already know.  
  
*Just twelve hours,* he tells himself. *Twelve more hours, and we kill every last one of those tin-can fucks.*

Coffee down the sink. Never made coffee even close to this bad before.
Ok, this is weird, add some more water to the kettle, grind a bit finer, make another coffee. Not as terrible, but not a lot better.

https://preview.redd.it/qgokk8aa4k0e1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ab252a1f7b9c4d8462a01000343735bd6496338

We all crave that feeling of accomplishment, the sweet taste of victory after a long journey, no matter what our profession. But as virtual assistants, with our offices often confined to our homes and our interactions largely digital, it can be easy to let those wins slip by unnoticed. We push onto the next task, the next deadline, the next client, without pausing to acknowledge our achievements. But celebrating your wins, big or small, is crucial, not just for your morale but also for your growth as a VA. It's about recognizing your hard work, recharging your motivation, and building a foundation for continued success.

# Why Celebrating Wins Matters More Than You Think

Think back to a time you achieved a major goal. Remember that rush of pride and satisfaction? Now imagine carrying that feeling into your next project. Celebrating your wins isn't just about fleeting happiness; it's a powerful tool for boosting your confidence and motivation. It reinforces positive behaviors, encourages you to strive for more, and helps you develop a growth mindset.

Moreover, celebrating your wins can help you build resilience. The VA life is full of challenges - demanding clients, technical glitches, the occasional bout of isolation. Acknowledging your accomplishments helps you remember your capabilities and strengthens your ability to bounce back from setbacks.

# Creative Ways to Celebrate Your VA Victories

Celebrating wins doesn't have to mean throwing a confetti-filled party every time you finish a task (though, hey, no judgment if you do!). It's about finding meaningful ways to acknowledge your progress and reward yourself. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

* **Treat Yourself:** Finished a big project? Indulge in something you love. Maybe it's a fancy coffee, a new book, or that online course you've been eyeing. Personally, I love to celebrate with a good meal. There's something incredibly satisfying about cooking a favorite dish or trying out a new restaurant after a week of hard work.
* **Reflect and Journal:** Take some time to reflect on your accomplishment. What challenges did you overcome? What did you learn? Journaling about your wins can help you track your progress, identify patterns of success, and cultivate gratitude.
* **Share your Success:** Don't be shy about sharing your wins with others. Post your achievements on social media, update your website with testimonials, or simply share the good news with friends and family. Sharing your accomplishments not only helps you celebrate but also builds your professional reputation.
* **Take a Break:** Sometimes the best way to celebrate is to simply step away from work. Go for a walk, spend time with loved ones, or engage in a hobby. Giving yourself time to recharge will help you return to work feeling refreshed and motivated.
* **Set New Goals:** Use your celebration as an opportunity to look ahead. What do you want to achieve next? Setting new goals keeps you moving forward and gives you something to strive for.

# Building a Culture of Celebration

Celebrating wins isn't a one-time event; it should be an ongoing practice. Make it a habit to acknowledge your accomplishments, no matter how small. Schedule time for reflection, reward yourself regularly, and share your successes with others. By building a culture of celebration, you'll create a positive and motivating work environment that fosters growth and success. Remember, every win, every milestone, every hurdle overcome deserves to be acknowledged. So, go ahead and savor that success!

DETAILS:
I currently work retail management in a store that I have always loved. I just got offered an ASM position at a well known coffee shop (I‚Äôm sure you can guess), with the intention to promote to store manager within 6 months. 
Main deciding factors are: 1) Would initially be taking a very slight pay cut, however would make significantly more after promotion. (Promotion is not 100% guaranteed and dependent upon store location) 2) 300 hours of vacation at new job versus my current 40 hours. 3) New job is salaried, current job is hourly- concerned about working more than 40/week and no overtime. 4) Currently working very very late nights almost every day, which is not normal for my position and indicative that the people making the schedule are treating me differently than others. New job would be mostly VERY early mornings (I am not a morning person but currently working until 11pm everyday has ruined my social life and causing issues in my relationship). 5) Currently burnt out and miserable at current job, however I love the job/store/industry itself and it‚Äôs other factors that have caused it. I have no room for promotion within relocation, which is not possible for me right now. 6) This might sound horrible but my current job title is decently impressive, I am proud of telling people my position and where I work, and I know the new job will come with judgements as it‚Äôs less of a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù. I am trying not to care what people think but I‚Äôm getting older with no set career and it is difficult..

I am so split in this decision I really need any help possible. If anyone has opinions in general about this specific well-known coffee shop that rhymes with Rawrbucks, I would love to hear it! I know there are mixed opinions on the company itself, however from speaking with my old coworker it sounds like our district is a decent enough place to work.. Maybe?! üòÖ

He helped me run away for my abusive family and got us a studio to live in. The first year was amazing, until he decides to quit his job and I had to take on the financial burden of two people renting in a very expensive city while barely making minimum wage for 3 years, and after threatening to leave him a dozen times he finally got a job and things seemed to be getting better.

 Until about two months ago his mother opened a business and offered him to come work for her, for the first few days it was good,  his happy to be closer to his family and I was getting along with everyone, even helping in the business for free 2-3 times a week until I get a job.
Well his started telling everything happening between us to his mom, and getting mad at me for being ""lazy"" and not waking up before him to make him coffee ( which is something I never did and we never ever talked about). His mom even took me aside and told me that it's my ""duty"" like WTF??
Then all hell broke loose when he decided to bring up the subject of having babies in front of his mom and step-dad while we were having dinner, and getting mad after I said it will only happen after we are financially stable and at least own an appartement ( which we already spoke about many times in private) he then got mad and told me that I'm just making excuses, and that all his friends have kids already, few minutes later he apologized, told me that he was wrong and that he loves me.
The next day I came to help them and he told me how to do a certain task and I answered with ""yeah Babe I know don't worry"" with very calm tone, but he got made and said that I talk to much  and act like I know everything while I'm not even part of the business ( I guess that‚Äôs what for helping ???) Oh yeah and the times that I didn't come to help, he would say that I don't appreciate his family and what they do for us ( they did help with moving and brought us groceries couple of times).
I didn't speak to him for the rest of the day and when we got home he blew up, saying that he feels like he's dating an old woman who is always tired, and that he can easily find someone much better than me, that he has options, and that when he leaves me only then will I realize how lucky I was.
Well I took him on he's word and broke up with him the next day, its liberating but I'm also scared to be alone for the first time in my life...

One minute she was completely in control of the argument, shooting me the mother of all glares across the dining room table, and the next, she was dripping from my face like congealed spaghetti sauce. 

Her voice was still alive in my ears, even with her staining my cheeks.

Dripping from my lashes.

I could taste her in my mouth.

""You're a child,"" Mom's voice was still in my mind.

""I'm old enough to drive a car,"" I had said matter-of-factly, waving my spoon in protest. I reached for my favorite cereal, but she slapped my hand away, placing a bowl of plain oats in front of me. I had been cursed with an almond Mom.

Which meant the only snacks I saw had raisins instead of chocolate chips. 

Breakfast was always the root of all disagreements in the Sinclair household. Mom wasn't a morning person.

My brother and sister had headed to school early.

I couldn't imagine why.

""With your father supervising,"" Mom's grip on her coffee was tightening. I could tell she was ready to blow up, but I was determined to change her mind.

Her argument was that she didn't want me to get hurt, but I knew it went deeper than that. Mom wanted to ruin my life. 

She was an expert at it, already forbidding me from going out of town and implementing a curfew. ""I said no, and I mean no,"" Mom said with a sigh. 

""You're inexperienced. When you're eighteen, I'll think about it. End of conversation."" She prodded the table impatiently. ""Eat your breakfast, please.""

""But that's not fair,"" I could feel my blood boiling. ""Why am I the one being punished? You're giving Sera lessons!‚Äù 

She fixed me with a warning look. ""You're not being *punished*.""

""I clearly am,"" I retorted. ""I don't see this same energy with Nathaniel!""

Mom sighed. ""Your brother is one year older. He is old enough to drive a car. I‚Äôm finished discussing this matter with you. If you disagree, you're free to move out and make up your own rules.""

I slammed my spoon on the table. ""But‚Äî""

Mom sipped her coffee. ""End of conversation.""

""You're not even being fair!""

Mom's eyes narrowed. ""End,"" she put heavy emphasis on the word, ""of con‚Äî""

I didn't even want to hear it. She was so stubborn. Even more childish than me, and I was supposed to be the kid. 

Instead of listening to her, I pressed my hands over my ears and screamed in frustration, my own words trembling on my lips, halting, when something warm splashed on my face, followed by a high-pitched ringing in my ears. I felt the shock of it, rich copper filling my mouth and splattering over my eyes.

Initially, I thought she'd gone to the extreme and thrown her coffee in my face. But coffee wasn't this thick and coppery, clinging to my lashes and blurring my vision. 

It sounded like a nuclear bomb had gone off right in front of me. A slowly expanding bright light, darkness speckling across my eyes, and then‚Ä¶ nothing. Mom was there, scowling at me disapprovingly, and then she wasn't. 

I remember her face being carved with morning sunlight filtering through the blinds, her loose ponytail trailing down her back, and her bright pink bathrobe.

I blinked slowly, the ringing sound growing louder, more intense. Like a singular coin rattling around in my skull. 

The sunlight was still there. But it was blocked out, only existing in strands of glittering light peeking through the intense smear of red covering my eyes.

She was everywhere, and yet also somehow still existing in front of me, her torso swaying back and forth like a bad fucking cartoon. Blinking red from my eyes, I could sense a cry slowly clawing its way up my throat. 

Different shades of red covered our kitchen, painting the walls and dripping from the countertop.

The coin rattling in my skull stopped dancing, my ears popped, and the world came to a grinding stop around me.

Something wet and fleshy dropped from the ceiling, and the scream that had been wrangled in my throat, fighting for an escape, slipped out in a sob that wracked my chest.

Mom felt like congealed spaghetti sauce clinging to my face, pieces of her skull sticking to my pajamas.

When her torso smacked onto the ground, a horrifying cavern where her head used to be, I stumbled back, slipping in the spreading red pool gliding across our kitchen tiles. 

I remembered how to move. In one stride, I was out of the kitchen, gasping for breath, my hands on my knees. 

In two strides, I was standing on our doorstep staring dazedly at a crashed car in the middle of the road.

Several of them scattered down the block. I recognized this one.

Mrs. Petra's Honda Civic.

The car had flipped onto its side, but I could see the scarlet dripping from the windows. There was someone in there.

A little girl, five or six years old.

Her mouth was wide, O-shaped, streaks of red pooling down her face, dark ringlets of hair stuck to her pale skin. Emily, her daughter. I didn't hear her cries until my ears popped again. 

But this time it wasn't just Emily. Screams were erupting across my neighborhood. 

Our town had come to a standstill, shrieking car alarms joining the cacophony of cries enveloping together. Pulling Emily out of the smoking wreck of the car, I covered the little girl's eyes and held her to my chest. What was left of Mrs. Petra was slumped in her seatbelt. 

It wasn't just my mother and Mrs. Petra.

After taking Emily home, the effects of seeing my mother blown to pieces right in front of me started to blossom. I scratched at the skin of my arm, but I couldn't get her off of me. She was caked into my hair and glued to my lashes.

I spat several times, and then my gut lurched, heaving up undigested cereal.

In a daze, I checked every house. Each one held a similar scene. An explosion of grisly red, and children without parents.

Once the ringing in my ears had subsided, and I was more in control of myself, I joined the growing crowd of kids searching for an answer to what was going on. A kid on a skateboard told me there was a crash at the end of the road, and I remembered my siblings. I headed in the direction of school, feeling sick to my stomach.

I found them among a group of kids, sitting on the sidewalk looking dazed.

The two didn't react when I tried to hug them. Sera's eyes were vacant, unseeing caverns staring into oblivion.

Nathaniel wouldn't look me in the eye, squeezing me a little too tight, pressing his head into my shoulder still stained with our mother. He was a shell of his former self, the brother I had playfully fought hours earlier because he refused to let me drive his car. Sera wanted to ride the bus, and in a mark of rebellion, Nathaniel followed her.

If they had decided to drive to school, they could have been dead. 

Nathaniel dropped his head into his lap, panting into his jeans.

Sera kept shooting me hopeful looks.

Like I would know what to do.

Two years younger than me, and my little sister was already looking at me like I was an adult. Their bus had turned over, intense red seeping onto the road, shattered windows, and headless bodies littering the walk. There were kids walking around confused, covered in what was left of the bus driver.

Nathaniel and Sera seemed to be the only ones consciously awake while others wandered around crying out for their parents. The three of us hugged, but I could barely sense my siblings wrapped around me. I had no idea how to tell them our mother was all over me.

From their expressions, Nathaniel wrapping Sera into a hug, and my sister sobbing into his chest, they already knew.

Our town had been normal like every other, and in the blink of an eye, everything was fucking gone.

Parents. We were covered in them. Teachers. Upon pushing through the school entrance, there was carnage. 

Traumatised fourteen year olds were hysterical, dripping in scarlet while the older kids took the opportunity to go wild without adult authority, trashing classrooms and raiding vending machines. It was everyone. 

99.9% of our town's population exploded that day, but it was my mother who was still staining my face, her blood ingrained into my flesh. 

I couldn't scrub her off of me, no matter what I did. 

The outside came to help in a matter of hours. 

I wouldn't call it ""help"" though. 

According to the outside, we were a town going through an unprecedented event. Which meant a quarantine cutting us off from the outside world. 

After briefing us in the school auditorium, we were told not to panic, and that help was coming. 

Spoiler alert: they were scared of us and what they thought was a contagion, so that so-called *help* didn't exist. 

That left babies without mother's,  the preschoolers without parental figures, and an entire school of teenagers to fend for themselves. You would think a group of kids would know what to do in a town-wide apocalypse, right? 

Especially when we had been abandoned by the outside world. 

In the first few weeks, we went kind of insane. Lord of the flies, insane. 

If you were vocal, you became a leader. 

And that meant the popular kids started to take control, taking advantage of kids with no family and nothing to lose, and recruiting them into gangs. 

Thankfully, that stopped when help did eventually come. 

Several drones were sent into our quarantine zone one month into the town-wide lockdown. They brought boxes full of medical supplies, food, electronics (despite them turning off the internet two months later due to a breach in security. Wendy Carmichael had made a now deleted  reddit post entitled ""We are TRAPPED! The story of my town under quarantine."") 

Wendy quickly became an outsider, after we were forced to hand over all of our electronics. 

There were also instructions on building a community in unprecedented times. We were told to elect a leader, a spokesperson who would make the rules. Gracie Lockhart became that person. 

She was the only one who wanted to run, and I guess everyone was scared of her because her now dead father happened to be mayor. Still though, kids wanted someone to look up to, someone to tell them what to do and give them a sense of purpose. 

Rules were put into place and everyone over the age of 13 were given a job, whether that was a cook at the university where meals were served, or stuck in the preschool with the kids. 

In the first month, I was a delivery girl. When the electronics were still working, kids used all of that pent up frustration and trauma on shopping. 

So, I would wake up at 5am every day, bike to the man-made metal barrier standing between our town and the outside world, and pick up the growing mountain of Amazon packages dumped on our side. I enjoyed my time as a delivery girl. I used it as a distraction from thinking about Mom's death. 

I barely saw my brother and sister, apart from at night. 

The three of us had taken up residence in a random house we'd found. 

Sera liked the swimming pool, but we chose it because it was far away from our parents. 

Sera's job was at the kindergarten, which she hated with a passion. While Nathaniel was an unwilling member of the research committee.

Not exactly a job that helped us, but Gracie and her carefully chosen council, who were just literally her friends, forced my brother and several others to scour the town and find out how this happened. Nathaniel said it was just an excuse for the popular kids to slack off.

We already had a scientific explanation, presented to us by the CDC themselves. 

It was a contagion that worked like spontaneous human combustion, and seemed to be leaving children alone. 

Gracie's group were obsessed with this huge conspiracy that went from aliens, to a lab-leak at the local university where they were convinced biological weapons were being made. 

Nathaniel had requested several times to be given another job‚Äì but one particular girl on the research committee had a crush on my brother. 

With her being so close to Gracie and the newly instated town council, she had a certain amount of authority, and could abuse it anyway she wanted. And fuck, did she *abuse* it. 

Gradually, as it became progressively more obvious that the outside world had left us to rot, and our community started to run out of the rations provided for us, the council began to take advantage of the amount of power they had. Sure, blame it on repressed trauma or PTSD. 

But I would go as far to say these kids were sociopaths. 

We called them The Dark Days. 

Because in a matter of weeks, our world started to come apart. 

It started with a message from the outside, that our food was delayed. 

So, we starved. The kids in power started getting bored. Kids were refusing to work without food. 

Normal crashed and burned, humanity bleeding away into something else. 

Those in authoritative positions were no longer quietly plucking the good looking guys and girls for their own personal pleasure. They were ordering our 'police force', a small group of volunteers, to drag them from their homes and present them to the council. 

*Please bring ALL chocolate to the council.*

*Guys with gross fucking hair cuts (I'm talking about YOU Oliver Bentley) are no longer allowed inside the cafeteria. Cut your hair and look decent, or starve.*

*Any cute dogs must be handed over.* 

*If you're physically attractive and want one of the last cans of soup, you can earn it. ONLY hot guys and girls! If you look like a hobbit, you'll be turned away.*

So yeah, normal began to crumble.

We tried to uphold it, but when the council started using older kids as toys and playthings, that was when our little community fell apart. Nathaniel was one of those chosen to *serve* the council, in what started as a stupid announcement, and quickly turned into a rule. Those who were chosen to be right hands to the council must NOT resist, or their loved ones would suffer. 

We were starving, delirious, and going crazy. 

Before our leader could go full Lord of the Flies, however, the outside world stepped in. Thank god. 

Gracie had her leadership revoked, along with her council, and all of her orders were thankfully banned. Nathaniel and the others were freed. Sera and I dragged him from a hotel room, which looked innocent enough. 

We found him playing Switch games cross legged on the floor. 

According to Nathaniel, there was a lot of PG13 non-consensual groping. 

He laughed it off, but there was an emptiness in his eyes I didn't like.

His smile was too big. Sera pointed out blood on the bed sheets, but I blocked it out, nodding dizzily when Nathaniel insisted he was fine. The perpetrator, who had my brother and five other senior girls and guys trapped in her hotel room fashioned into a sex den, was nowhere to be seen. 

Probably hiding in shame.  

I called it out as sexual assault and thankfully, more kids spoke out. Gracie was indirectly arrested. Meaning, as soon as the quarantine was over, she and her little group were in big trouble. 

I heard the charges were severe. Forced imprisonment and non-consensual sex.

For the time being, they were put on house arrest.

Thankfully, a new council was built from kids with actual intelligence and a passion for leadership. Liam Cartwright became our leader, and in his first role of replacement mayor, he demanded the soldiers bring us enough food and supplies to last us for a month.

The outside world reluctantly complied and we went back to normal. Ish. 

The girl who sexually assaulted my brother, Tally Edwards,  was officially a missing person, which became our first real case. 

Liam put together a force of ten able bodied kids to act as a police force and investigate the girl's disappearance. 

I got my job back as a delivery girl. When our Internet was cut off though, I became a sort-of food delivery service instead. 

But I liked it.

There was something therapeutic about awaiting our daily shipments, watching the outside world continue while we had come to a grinding halt. 

A year passed. Without parents, adults, and normality. 

But we made it work. We were a bunch of sixteen and seventeen year olds trying to keep afloat. Normal. But just like the world outside, death existed in our makeshift community too. Five kids.

Mostly from neglect. 

Taryn James and her friends had found a dead baby inside the wreck of a car. A fifteen year old girl had jumped out of a tree on a dare and landed head first. 

Three toddlers had come down with fevers that killed them despite us having the right medical supplies. 

We might have had medicine, but the kids working at the hospital had no idea what they were doing. Why would they? The eldest was seventeen, and he ran away, puking into his hand, when the fifteen year old was brought in, half of her skull caved in. 

The outside world only helped us with food. The rest, we had to fend for ourselves. The assholes didn't even send in medics. In their words, it was a risk they couldn't take. Little kids were dying, but because of a phantom *contagion* that was yet to claim any more lives, they couldn't save them. 

Kids weren't just dying, they were disappearing too. 

The missing had doubled. 

Two kids were now gone, both of them part of Gracie's original council, and Gracie herself had somehow managed to build her own little cult. She believed that God had taken her friends, and they had simply followed our parents to heaven. Judgement day was a new one. 

The week before, Gracie was screaming about aliens and lights in the sky when I biked past the school, where a concerning number of followers sat in a circle around her. Now she was convinced her friends had been raptured. 

Cliques had formed around town, which became noticeable on my bike ride. 

You can't be cut off from the outside without forming a cult-like group. 

But hey, we all had our ways of coping with losses we couldn't even register.

I had my own group. My fellow delivery kids. We weren't exactly a cult, but we were a family, and we had cute lime green uniforms and caps. The sun was setting when I was starting my night shift, sitting on the barrier, my legs dangling. 

The sky was a smear of orange and red, and I found myself hypnotised by the dying sunlight illuminating the clouds. 

I wasn't technically allowed to sit on the barrier.

If I fell off, I was donezo. But it was fun to get a peek into the outside world. 

If I tilted my head at just the right angle, I could see a fully functioning Mcdonalds in the distance, ironically bathed in a heavenly glow. Below me, the winding road was blocked off with yellow tape, barricades in place. Nathaniel was on my mind. His new job was taking up all of his time, but when he was free, he still didn't come home. 

I told him to request a zoom appointment with a therapist. 

 fighting over the shower, and hiding cereal from Sera and I. But even when he was laughing, his expression didn't match his eyes. I wanted to talk about what happened with him and Tally. 

Maybe he thought it was his fault she was missing. Sera had told me to step off for a while, though this had been going on for months. It's like something inside was killing him, eating away at him. 

And I knew it was what happened inside that hotel suite. 

""Testing, testing,"" a familiar drawl crackled through my talkie sticking out of my pocket and cutting through my thoughts. Nathaniel was fine, I thought. 

I was just over reacting. My colleague's voice was a welcome distraction, bleeding into the peaceful silence. The British accent was the icing on the cake.

""Do they have ramen? I repeat. We are in short supply of ramen,"" He paused. ""Especially the carbonara style ones. You know, the ones in the TikTok store."" 

He sighed, his voice immediately bringing my mood up. 

""Ah, yes, TikTok! I miss my daily supply of brain rotting dopamine. Do you remember those pool filling videos? They were what made me realize I had undiagnosed ADHD.""

Jude Lightwood  was an unlikely friend. I barely knew him before the quarantine, and now I knew his deepest, darkest secrets he spilled to me during our night shift awaiting our weekly delivery. 

Jude took the other side of town, while I took the main entrance. We spent most of our time talking on the talkies, or in his case, giving me his entire life story.

Still though, nothing beat staying up until the early hours of the morning, watching the first flicker of dawn appear in the sky, listening to him half deliriously reenact the entire first season of Breaking Bad from memory. 

Yes, even with the voices. 

I missed a delivery once because I was almost on the edge of hysterics, laughing at his Jesse Pinkman impression which was to a freakin' T. 

Pulling out my talkie, I pressed the button, swinging my legs in mid-air. ""You do know they're MRE'S, right? I don't think we have a choice. We'll be lucky to get rice and chicken."" I paused. 

""Also, you don't seem like the type of guy who used to go on TikTok."" 

He wasn't. Before the disaster, Jude spent most of his time in the school library. 

He was known for his side hustle, selling *candy* to seniors. He started as a British exchange student who nobody could understand, and quickly rose up in the social hierarchy due to his accent. I only knew him from English class, when our teacher had asked him what the capital of Australia was, and Jude, half asleep, had responded with, ""Huhh? New Zealand?"" 

He was officially 'New Zealand' to me, until he formally introduced himself on my second day on the job, offering me coffee, and spilling it all over himself.  

Jude scoffed. I enjoyed his presence. Even if it was just his voice. ""I just said I watched pool filling videos, like, in a total trance,"" he laughed, but then his laugh kind of choked up. I could tell he was having a light bulb moment. He had them a lot, and they were all related to what happened to the town's adults.

""What if it's like, Gods?"" Jude had proclaimed into the whipping wind one morning, the two of us cycling to work. When I twisted around to shoot him a pointed look, he shrugged, cycling harder, reddish dark hair flying in a blur around him. ""It's probable! Like, what if Zeus is pissed? He's punishing us!‚Äù 

*""Aliens?""* he'd said, while we were lifting packages onto the loading bay. 

I hit him with a package in my hands. 

‚ÄúCthulhu?‚Äù Jude mumbled, half asleep, the two of us labelling envelopes. 

*What if it's microchips in our brains?""* 

Jude came out with it through a mouthful of mash potato during lunch, the two of us lounging on the school roof. His second epiphany of the day. When I shoved him, he laughed. This guy's charming smile made it hard for me to hate him. He came up with these ""What if's"" to drive me crazy, I swear.

His *'theories'* stretched all the way to our town somehow being related to The Simpson Movie. Though this time, I caught a certain seriousness in his tone. 

""What if *that* is what saved us?"" 

I pondered his question, watching a bird swoop across the sky. ""You think TikTok saved us from combusting?"" 

""No!"" he laughed. ""Well, yes. Stay with me here, but adults don't use it much, right?"" 

Jude took a deep breath. I could tell he had already jumped to the next tangent. ""Wait. I can see a group of kids in the town across from us eating Five Guys. My mouth is watering,"" he groaned. ""This is torture. I can see the fried onions. I can see the animal style fries and sauce!"" 

Jeez, how good was his sight? 

""Do you have binoculars?"" I couldn't resist a laugh. 

""No! Yes. Maybe. I'm just borrowing them.""

""Jude,"" I said, shuffling uncomfortably. My butt had gone to sleep. ""Are you sitting on the barrier?"" 

He didn't reply for a moment. ""That depends. Is a certain Liam Cartwright with you?"" 

I spluttered, holding the button down. ""You think our seventeen year old mayor is checking up on the delivery kids? Poor Liam is probably asleep.""

""Oh god, yeah,"" I could sense him making a face. ""Our boy is starting to look like a divorced father of three."" Jude cleared his throat, and the feedback went right through me. ""I am sitting on the barrier, by the way. I can see Orion from here. I used to look at constellations with my Mum. She had one of those cool ancient telescopes.""

Something sickly twisted in my gut. Tipping my head back, I searched for the star, though I wasn't sure where I was looking. ""So, you're looking through the tiny hole in the barrier?"" 

""Mmmhmm."" He chuckled. ""Curse my 20/20 vision. I wanted to get an idea of what normal life is like, and I get hit in the face with burgers. I want Five Guys so bad. I would *kill* for one,"" I could hear him adjusting the dial on the talkie. ""Did you know some people desperate enough would kill for a takeout?"" 

There was a pause and I heard his slight intake of breath, his shuffling crackling into interference.

I didn't even have to reply. Jude never stopped talking. 

""Don't you think this is‚Ä¶kinda cool? Apart from the whole, uh, end of the world, dystopian, only-our-town thing.""

I could see my breath dancing in front of me, and zipped up my jacket, responding in a gasp, ""Freezing our asses off waiting for mediocre meals?"" 

""No. Like, what we're doing. I feel like I'm keeping watch for the undead while my friends, the last survivors of humanity, sleep."" Jude snorted. ""Instead, I'm a glorified UberEats delivery guy for a community of kids.""

""You enjoy it though,"" I said through a yawn, rubbing my hands together. 

The early November chill was already seeping into my bones. 

He responded in a hum. ""It's aight.""

Jude sighed, leaving us both in a peaceful silence. 

""How did you get on the barrier, Ria?"" 

His question took me off guard, an ice cold shiver ripping down my spine. 

""What?"" 

""Well, I have Ben to give me a hand to climb up. Even if he sleeps all the way through his shift, his bulky legs make up for it. But you? You're alone, so how exactly are you getting up there?"" 

He paused, and the shriek of feedback sent me jolting, immediately losing my concentration. Jude laughed, and I couldn't resist twisting around, scanning the empty road behind me. 

No sign of any life. 

My radio crackled, and I jumped for the first time in a while. 

""Wait, wait, wait,"" Jude's tone had significantly darkened. ""So, you're telling me *you* managed to scale a barrier this high with zero help?"" 

For a moment, my tongue was tangled. ""I stand on crates,"" I said, ""Obviously.""

Jude hummed. ""Sounds like bullshit, Ria.‚Äù

I tightened my grip on my talkie, fingering the off switch. ""Why do you care?"" 

""Oh, I don't,"" He chuckled. ""I'm just curious how you learned how to climb this high.""

The silence that followed twisted my gut into knots. I could just hear Jude's breathing, and, if I really listened out for it, the late evening traffic coming through the town over the barrier. 

Jude surprised me with a laugh. ""I'm just messin' with ya, Ria. The night shift goes to my head, y'know? I gotta find new ways of bantering wi' ya.""

""Sure,"" I said, but my chest was clenching. 

""Ooh, shit. I think my delivery is here. I gotta go before they spot me on the barrier,"" he panted. ""Uh, over and out! Or whatever you're supposed to say‚Äì"" 

Switching off the talkie and cutting off his  farewell, a fresh slither crept down my spine. 

My delivery came soon after.

5000 MRE's. 

I tore into the first one, unable to help myself. But Jude's words were still in my mind, making me paranoid. Paranoia made me desperate. Being desperate made me remember how hungry I was. 

I was stuffing handfuls of cold rice and chicken into my mouth when the sour-faced man helping me unload the shipment cleared his throat. 

""You're supposed to microwave it, sweetheart.""

I ignored him. ""Is this it?"" I said through a mouthful of mush. Mush had never tasted so fucking good. ""No snacks?"" 

He threw me a crushed Milky Way, making sure to keep his distance. 

""There's a snack. Knock yourself out.""

After spending all night delivering MRE'S to locked doors that were normally open and welcoming, I finally reached home with three ready to eat. 

I had picked the best ones for my family. Chilli for Nathaniel, chicken and noodles for Sera, and fried rice for me. 

When I opened the door, I was greeted to soft snores, my little sister sleeping on the couch, and Nathaniel wrapped up in a blanket on the floor. I pulled my food out of the package, threw it in the microwave, and then collapsed on the floor next to my brother. I was so tired. 

So fucking tired, I could barely move my legs. 

What did Jude say again? 

*How exactly did you get onto the barrier, Ria?*

The microwave dinging didn't wake me up. The stink of burning plastic and cremated food did. 

""Get up."" The voice was familiar, pulling me out of my thoughts. When I didn't move, someone kicked me violently in the stomach, and something was dropped onto my head. I sat up, a scream clawing in my throat, the burned remnants of my dinner dripping down my face. Standing over me were two pairs of feet, and when I looked up, I glimpsed Gracie Lockhart. 

She made sense, she was a psycho. 

But not Liam, our mayor, who was supposed to be sane. 

""Get up!"" This time, I was kicked in the head. I felt my brain bounce around my skull, my vision blurring. I was on my feet, off balance. All around me was a startling orange. I thought it was from the microwave catching fire, but then the blurred orange was moving. 

Gracie, Liam, and two other guys held flaming torches. 

The light was mesmerizing. 

I found myself transfixed, until I snapped out of it. Nathaniel was in front of me, his arms bound behind his back. 

A squeaking, muffling Sera was struggling in between two girls' grasp.

I found my voice. ""What‚Ä¶ what's going on?"" 

My arms were violently pinned behind my back. When I twisted around, I found myself eye to eye with my best friend. Jude wore a hooded sweatshirt, hiding under his curls. He didn't make eye contact with me, shoving me towards the door along with the others. 

""Witch."" Gracie spat in my face, before pulling me out of our house, throwing me onto my knees. I tried to lift my head, but Gracie stomped on my back, and I bit back a shriek. Nathanial and Sera were thrown next to me, and I stared at the reflection in my brother's eyes following the orange glow lighting up the dark. In front of us, a hoard of kids stood in front of us, all of them holding torches burning bright. 

""We've found them!"" Gracie cried to them, only for them to cheer, a psychotic hive mind thirsty for our blood. 

""We have FOUND the evil who did this to our parents! Who trapped us!"" 

She‚Ä¶ had to be kidding, right? 

Nathaniel shook his head, his eyes wide. ""What? You're fucking serious?!"" 

Gracie crouched in front of us, and held up her phone. Her 'evidence' was a screenshot of a tweet posted the same day the adults exploded. All it said was, *""The Sinclairs are witches.""* posted from an account with zero followers, zero likes, and a default profile picture.

Panic started to creep into my gut. 

The town was already losing their minds from isolation and starvation. 

Could they really believe that we had started this? 

""Jude,"" I found my voice, a sharp squeak I didn't trust. 

When Gracie screamed, *blood for blood!* And forced me to my feet by my hair, I caught his eye in the crowd. 

""Jude, I'm not a fucking witch!""

""You killed my mum,"" he said in a whisper, a demented laugh slipping through his lips. ""She was all over me, and I couldn't breathe. Her blood was stuck to me. She was everywhere, Ria.""

""You know me,"" I managed to cry out. ""Jude, you know this is bullshit!"" 

He didn't reply, his expression hardening. I wish I could have seen a glitter of influence in his eyes. 

But it was all him.

Jude's fear had turned him into a monster. 

""Burn the witch,"" he said in a whimper, his lip curling. 

The boy's expression contorted, his hiss became a yell, cutting through the crowd's screams. ""Fucking burn them!""

""Burn them!"" The crowd hollered. 

I stopped fighting when we were dragged through town, rotten food and soiled diapers thrown in our faces. 

I knew where we were headed, and my body had gone numb. 

Nathaniel stayed still, silent, his dark eyes finding his friends in the crowd. 

Sera screamed, sobbing, begging to a group of kids who already decided her fate. 

It was Jude who shoved me against our founder tree, binding me to my siblings.

It was Jude who stepped back, gripping his torch for dear life. 

They surrounded us, a ring of blazing fire and expressions riddled with excitement. Gracie stepped forward, Liam by her side. 

I knew in her fucked up little mind, killing us would bring back the adults. 

And she had spread the word, like a virus, polluting the town's minds.

""Ria Sinclair,"" she stepped in front of me. 

Then the others. 

""Nathaniel Sinclair."" 

She was gentle with my sister, forcing Sera's head up with the tip of her manicure. 

""And Sera Sinclair.""

""We find you guilty of Witchcraft,"" she said. ""Your sentence is burning in the pits of hell where you belong."" 

I didn't take her seriously, not even with a burning torch in her grasp, until the girl pulled out a knife from her pocket. 

I turned my attention to the sky when the blade was drawn across my sobbing sister's throat. 

When her cries gurgled and deep, dark red spotted the earth, I looked at the moon poking from the clouds instead. 

I didn't see my sister die. 

I just saw her body slump over, her head of dark brown curls hanging in her face. 

The crowd's reaction was haunting, calls for my sister's head to be severed and waved in the air in triumph. 

I kept my gaze on the sky, tears filling my eyes. 

""Nate."" I managed to get out.

*She's dead*, I wanted to scream. 

*Our sister is dead.*

""Nate!"" I screamed. 

He didn't reply, even when Gracie knelt in front of him and dragged the blade of the knife down his cheek and forcing him to look at her with the tip of her nail. 

""You're a fucking murderer,"" he said in a whimper, only for her to spit in his face.

Nathaniel didn't blink, struggling in his restraints. 

""Witch,"" Gracie Lockhart snarled at him, pressing the knife deeper. ""You're a filthy witch, Nathaniel Sinclair.""

I don't know what sealed the deal. 

Was it Gracie parading my sister's body in front of him, or spitting in his face? 

I could feel it already, icy prickles creeping down my bare arms, already playing with strands of my hair. 

When I twisted my head, Nathaniel was smiling. I saw the contortion in his cheeks, amusement morphing into agony, unnatural darkness spider-webbing across his pupils. 

Velvet magic.

He stunk of it. 

I fucking *knew* the asshole was using it! 

Velvet magic, also known as possession magic, had been banned a long time ago. 

It is to witches, what drugs are to humans. Addictive. Drawn from dark energy that humans naturally make, it is well known to take over the mind and soul of the witch possessing it. If my brother had been using Velvet magic, he was doing so with purpose. I was too, but I was‚Ä¶ inexperienced. Just like my mother said that morning. Only when I turned eighteen, would I be able to experiment with possession magic. 

I have a confession. 

What I wrote at the start wasn't the complete truth. 

Yes, I did scream at my mother. 

How was I supposed to know *fuck off and die* would actually work?

And more so, how would I know it would take out half of the fucking town?

Nathaniel was our family witch. 

Why was he using velvet magic in the first place? 

I had secretly been tearing myself apart for a year over my magic being the cause of our town-wide disaster. 

Was I wrong?  

Did *he* kill the adults? 

I should have been horrified when Gracie's brains started to leak out of her ears. 

Except she murdered my sister, and had bound me to a tree. 

Led a 'government' that assaulted my brother. 

The girl squeaked, slamming her hand over her mouth, smearing red dripping down her face. 

""Nate,"" I shot him a look.

But I don't think he saw it. Nathaniel just saw our little sister's dead body. 

I lost my breath when, with a single flick of his finger behind his back, Gracie's head was splitting apart, her delighted grin twisting into horror. 

She didn't even get to feel it; a mercy I knew the bitch didn't deserve. When a chunk of the girl's skull landed on the ground, lips still split into a grotesque skeletal grin, the crowd went silent.

Before...

Screams. 

Gracie's body hit the ground, and then caught alight, flames dancing across her skin. Without a word, Nathaniel calmly pulled apart his restraints, and with a single jerk of his wrist, an agonising scream escaping his lips, his eyes filled with black, sent the crowd flying several feet. 

I watched kids thrown back, helpless dolls caught in an invisible wind. One boy slammed into a tree, his body crumpling, a girl bisected on a wire fence. I didn't realize how powerful my brother really was. I should have cared about them, cared that they were dying. Hurting. 

But. 

They had murdered my fucking sister. 

When Nate dropped his hands, his gaze found mine and he opened his mouth. 

But his words were drowned out by mechanical shrieking from above us. 

Looking up, a helicopter was hovering, and I remembered my Mom's words. 

*Do not draw attention to yourselves, do you hear me?*

Her words echoed in my mind, when another helicopter appeared. 

*There are bad people, Ria. Bad witches looking for us. And if they find us, they'll kill us. Our entire coven in this town. They'll burn it to the ground.*

Nathaniel ignored the presence in the sky, wrapping his arms around me, squeezing me into a hug. The darkness in his eyes, spider webbing across his face, was something else. Velvet magic. He was consumed by it, drowning darkness.

But I didn't‚Ä¶ hate it.

If he was going to avenge Sera, then so be it. 

""One thousand five hundred."" Nate whispered into my shoulder before pulling away, his breaths heavy. ""One thousand five hundred."" His voice contorted into a giggle which wasn't my brother's. Mom taught us about possession magic. It converts witches, filling their minds with Dark influence. But I wanted it to fill him. 

If he was going to save our sister. 

""Blood for blood.""

Before I  could respond, rough hands were on my bindings, tugging them apart. ""Come on,"" a voice hissed out. But I was watching my brother scoop Sera's body into his arms. ""Are you stupid? Do you really want to hang around and let yourself be caught?""

I was dizzy, dragged by a shadow I fought against. But I was too weak, my magic rolling right off of him. 

""They're rounding up witches, idiot!"" the shadow's voice bled into one I knew. 

Jude.

Immediately, I twisted around, aiming a kick to his face which he easily dodged, grabbing my shoulders. I glimpsed that exact same flicker of darkness in his eyes. Velvet magic. 

The asshole was one of us, hiding in plain sight, and didn't save my sister. 

In fact, the bastard *watched*. 

He dragged me back, pulling me into a clearing when the crowd started screaming, this time led by Liam. 

Nathaniel had killed at least ten kids. 

When I risked a look, my brother was carrying my sister away, unfazed by the yells from above telling him to stay where he was. When sparks of dazzling purple hit the ground like fireworks, I realized the people shooting at us were not *human.*

Witches. 

Jude's lips latched to my ear, his breath ice cold. 

""Your *idiot* brother just gave them a reason to start hunting us down, and the Sinclairs are at the top of their list. So if *I* were you?"" He spoke through gritted teeth.

""I would start running.‚Äù",8,1731455741.0,ByfelsDisciple,0,0.9,False

My opinion is that Tariffs should be put in place for non-essential everyday goods, give us a little more time and resources to catch up with other countries in term of agriculture. We import So Many foodstuffs consumables, and we Wasted TONs of it on a daily basis.

I have been using this machine as a gift for about a two years now.

I have taken a break from coffee on and off and have just been picking them up with my meals from whever I am eating. I want to get back into brewing my own (yes I know its automatic) so Im not spending $7 on a cup of coffee (nuts).

Problem is, no matter what I do, water temp, grind size, grind time, brew size, my coffee just tastes like trash. When smelling a fresh brew, it is extremely strong and bitter.

I can adjust grind time from 4-6 seconds.

I can adjust water temp from 194 to 197.6.

I can adjust brew size from .75 oz to 1.5 oz.

I can adjust grind size from largest to smallest, who knows what the actual size is.

Ive tried a mix of alot of things and its still just not good. Even when I first started using the machine, it wasnt the best, but it gets the job done for not paying 7 bucks. Can anyone help? Im a bit lost. Using old beans, but even with fresh beans its still majorly average.

No fault codes or anything.

I opened up the service door to see what was going on and the entire back of the machine was filled with water and chunks of crystallized coffee. Lines don't appear clogged.

For context, I (F30s) work at factory that builds parts. I'm in quality, so I work with engineers, but I am not one. Also, I am not a morning person. I work second shift for a reason; it takes me at least two cups of coffee to be functional and pleasant on a good day. This was not a good day. 

My shift normally starts around 3, but this particular week, I was coming in at 9 to work with Jeremy (M70s, not his real name) on first shift to train for a certification. Jeremy is the only other guy in the whole building who has the cert. He's a pretty chill older gentleman who probably should have retired a long time ago, but he gets bored sitting at home doing nothing. He's soft spoken, though, and only talks when he has something important to say. At 9AM, we get along like gangbusters.  

There are several engineers going in and out of the room at any given time, and then there's Barry (M40s- also not his real name). Barry is an engineering tech, not an engineer. Doesn't have an engineering degree. Every person I've ever talked to about Barry has said that if he was half as smart as he thought he was, he'd be twice as smart as anyone else in the building. What I've noticed: He's pompous. He's condescending. He's loud. He will get on a tangent and just keep talking at you. He overestimates his likability. He'll corner you in the hallways just to pat himself on the back about something. In short, Barry is kryptonite to 9:00 a.m. Squeegee brain. 

Caught up? Great. 

So on Tuesday of this week, Barry had come into the room around our normal start time (after I'd been there for 6 hours) and though I was in a generally pleasant mood, I was not particularly inclined to be lectured on the Pythagorean theorem that day. All I wanted to know was what dimension on the blueprint I was supposed to measure, because the instructions were unclear. I didn't even ask Barry, I asked another coworker, and Barry just happened to overhear. What I got was 45 minutes of highschool geometry. He kept throwing in little sprinkles of ""Now, you don't have to remember this, but *I* do,"" ""Don't worry, *you'll* never have to know this."" It took everything in me to keep my mouth shut. 

Wednesday, I get to work, Jeremy pulls a seat over for me and we start going over the training. I get to a point a few hours later where I need to use some equipment across the room to take a measurement, and Barry walks up. Makes some offhanded comment about ""Look at you trying to learn new things, do you need help with that?"" Nope, I'm good, thanks for offering. Get trapped an a 30 minute conversation about calibration for my troubles.

Thursday rolls in, and I'm definitely more zombie than human. I have coffee firmly grasped in my hand. I have no patience for shenanigans. I walk into the room and beeline over to Jeremy, but In my zombie state I run smack into Barry. I mumble an apology, and Barry steps back, and the following happens:

Barry: ""Oh, that's ok. What are you doing here?""

Me, as if I'm talking to a small child: ""I work here"" (Jeremy and the other guys on shift start laughing quietly)

Barry: ""Well yes, but what are you doing here?""

Me, still deadpan: "" Working."" (Jeremy and crew are getting less quiet)

Barry: ""Well what on?""

Me: ""...Work"" (someone snorts. All pretense at laughing quietly is forgotten)

And I stood there and just stared at him until he walked away. He eventually just shrugged and walked off.  But it bought me at least a couple months of Barry-free shifts, and he avoids me in the hallways now. ",112,1731454309.0,pettyrevenge,12,0.97,False

I only met him a few times as a group but I started liking him too - but at one night out we both got drunk, started getting a bit touchy, and ended up hooking up. When we were about to go more than a kiss he said ""I wasn't expecting this."" He lives in another city so we don't see each other often - but every time he visits, we continued to hang out, sometimes with our mutuals and sometimes by ourselves. On the last day of his previous visit to our city, he offered to have a coffee together before he left. I suggested a place near my apartment, and we ended up going to my place and hooked up again.
Now I think back - did my behaviour make him consider I am just a hookup? For example getting drunk with him, suggesting a place near mine when he was just ok with a coffee somewhere else - if I acted differently, was it just going to be a non-sexual date and we would have been in a different place? I am asking because I think I am attracted to him and I wish I acted differently to be taken seriously.
So I am curious - what makes a man differentiate a crush and a hookup? What makes you change your mind / downgrade them? If you really like a girl, would you sleep with her and still continue to be interested in her, or sleeping makes her downgrade to a hookup? ",1,1731454307.0,dating_advice,11,0.67,False

1gpyrmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1gpyrmo/papa_what_you_cooking_helps_preserve_downtown/,‚ÄòPapa What You Cooking‚Äô helps preserve downtown Reno history while also dishing out soul food,"Across the river from the ‚ÄòBelieve‚Äô sign and ‚ÄòSpace Whale‚Äô sculpture in downtown Reno, stands an interesting-looking historic building. Built in 1934, the building was designed by a local architect in Art Deco style, and originally served as a hybrid post office and federal office building.  
  
This location served as Reno‚Äôs main post-office until 1975, then continued as a smaller office until 2012, when a local development group acquired the space. In 2015 ‚ÄòThe Basement‚Äô opened, featuring a local marketplace of both dining and retail establishments located in the basement of the building. One of these businesses now there is a locally and family owned restaurant called Papa What You Cooking.  
  
It specializes in soul food, which is usually associated with authentic southern cuisine. Part-owner Kai Stanton explained their idea of soul food is different, and is more about unity and embracing family traditions, wherever you are.  
  
‚ÄúThe basis and the foundation of soul food is the soul of Nevada, the soul of families. And so it's not fried foods, it's not based on just one particular culture, It's multiple cultures coming together to say, ‚Äòhey, we're here, we're growing together,‚Äô‚Äù she explained.   
  
Stanton shared how they offer all types of wonderful savory and sweet foods. These include baked chicken, red beans and rice, shrimp and grits, as well as oxtails, which Stanton described as the must-try dish if you could only have one.   
  
‚ÄúOur wonderful oxtails pair well with a bed of rice and the gravy that comes from the oxtail juice that‚Äôs produced by being seared and cooked for 12 hours‚Ä¶ so many people love the oxtails,‚Äù she said.   
  
  
All of their food comes from original family recipes, with ingredients sourced from local Nevadan farmers. Some seasonings they have shipped from family back in Louisiana or New Orleans.  
  
Additionally, they offer a ‚ÄúSoulful Garden‚Äù menu, which contains salads and other options that cater to dietary restrictions. A unique element of the restaurant is it also contains a cafe-style coffee bar, with cookies, pies and other sweets.  
  
‚ÄúOur coffee is absolutely wonderful because we tag teamed with Wood-Fire Roasted Coffee here locally in town‚Ä¶ their beans come from Guatemala and Ethiopia which creates our Truckee River Roast,‚Äù said Stanton.   
  
Beyond providing unique offerings however, Stanton expressed pride in the restaurant being able to help grow the unity and legacy of Reno, while also preserving history. 	  
  
‚ÄúOne thing I want to share most of all, and I think we can all agree, is that we want to share the unity and the love of family, the heart and the beautiful culture of Reno, to preserve the historical buildings that were here, to help support not just Reno to grow, but to grow Reno's legacy and to help not just revamp downtown but to give amazing memories to downtown Reno and to allow families to enjoy the beautiful scenery that so many people have helped develop downtown,‚Äù she said.   
  
Stanton and her fianc√©, William Lyons, who is the other owner, had the idea to start a restaurant, after Lyons had many requests for his homemade cookies, cakes, and pies.   
  
‚ÄúIt started with something very small, people just appreciated the flavors of what we‚Äôve already developed,‚Äù said Stanton.   
  
With both recently retired, they stumbled upon the old post-office during a downtown stroll, and fell in love with the aesthetics and how it felt like ‚Äúa little home,‚Äù Stanton said.   
  
They also loved the idea of being in what Stanton calls ‚Äúthe heart‚Äù of Reno. Being in the downtown that‚Äôs right on the river allows them to reach both locals and tourists alike, while also being a vibrant part of the city‚Äôs development.  
  
‚ÄúTo be in the middle or the heart of something keeps blood flowing, keeps energy going, and to be a part of that amazing vibe and to bring not just the culture of family, but \[also\] embracing and helping with the revamping and development of downtown Reno‚Ä¶ And to be a part of the heartbeat of Nevada right downtown, we're hoping to be able to encourage other families to do the same.‚Äù Stanton said when speaking about the location of the restaurant and what it means.  
  
Stanton also commented on the interesting intersection between the legacy of the old post-office building, and the legacy they wish to leave behind for their family.   
  
For Stanton, their restaurant is keeping the culture of their childhood alive for their children and grandchildren, maintaining their legacy. Simultaneously, the legacy of the old post-office is preserved by it being still used. This inspires them.  
  
‚ÄúI love it when people come in and say, this is the building that I came with my mother or my grandmother to pick up their mail. And then to have something to try \[and eat\] that we've, you know, provided for them, just further enhances the legacy enrichment of coming to Reno and being in the heart of Reno,‚Äù she said.   
  
The name ‚ÄòPapa What You Cooking‚Äô is inspired by a common phrase uttered by Lyons‚Äô family members, as his cooking would often be the gravitational force that pulled the family together.   
  
‚ÄúThere's something about when Papa cooks food, it brings everyone together and everyone's so excited. And everybody has a Papa, right? And so him being the Papa in the culture at home as well, everyone would ask, Papa, what are you cooking?

I am single and dealing with anxiety and depression, which have only gotten worse since my work injury a year ago. I used to be active and happy. Maybe not always happy, but I have never felt this low. Now that I am not working, I have no structure in my life. We all need structure. I am on Workers' Compensation but doing it all alone is hard. Getting up each morning feels pointless sometimes, and I'm unsure how to find even a small spark again.

I feel like a burden to my family because I'm always down. I have read every self-help book, listened to audio tapes, and podcasts, and promised myself I would try Yoga, only to disappoint myself again because I can't push myself to do anything. I used to hike every other day, and now just going for a 10-minute walk is so hard. Friends will call and ask if I would like to visit, go to the movies or have a coffee, and I always make excuses so I don't have to go because I CAN'T!! When I say I Can't, I honestly mean I can't. I see my Therapist once a week; she helps, But then I get low again by the next day.

If you were to ask me what are my interests and goals? I have NONE!! and I HATE being like this. I was diagnosed with PTSD due to the incident at work. I waited until the end to mention this as I didn't want what was going on to only focus on that.

1gpybnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_brianwambui5/comments/1gpybnk/the_journey_of_a_family_man/,THE JOURNEY OF A FAMILY MAN,"My name is Brian Mburu Wambui. I was born and raised in Kenya, East Africa, by a single mother. I‚Äôm now 27 years old, with two wonderful sons who are 5 and 3. Growing up in a single-parent household wasn‚Äôt easy. From a young age, I had to understand what it meant to struggle, and I was forced to mature quickly to help my mother and contribute to our survival. Life has never been kind, and that has shaped me in ways I‚Äôm still trying to understand.

My early years were a mix of hope and hardship. I went through kindergarten and primary school like any other child, holding on to dreams of a better future. But when I reached secondary school, everything changed. During my third year, we simply couldn‚Äôt afford the fees anymore. I was around 16 or 17 when I had to drop out. It was a tough blow because education had been my hope for a different kind of life, a chance to break free from the cycle of poverty.

After dropping out, reality hit hard. With no formal qualifications, I took up the first job I could find: car washing. I worked long hours, from morning until late at night, scrubbing cars for little pay. If I made any mistakes, the employers would deduct from my already meager salary. It wasn‚Äôt just the physical labor that was tough; it was the constant reminder that some people don‚Äôt see others as human beings deserving of dignity. It was just about making a profit, even if it meant exploiting those who had nothing else. I tried to keep going, but the job felt more like slavery, and eventually, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I had to walk away.

Since then, I've done a variety of hustles, each one more challenging than the last. Whether it was odd jobs, manual labor, or selling small items, I did whatever I could to make a living. But no matter how hard I worked, it felt like I was always just barely getting by. Life was about surviving from one day to the next, and I could never seem to catch a break.

The constant struggle took a heavy toll on my personal life. The mother of my children‚Äîmy partner, the woman I thought I would share my life with‚Äîgrew tired of our circumstances. She couldn‚Äôt handle the daily grind, the poverty, the lack of basic comforts, and eventually, she left. That broke me in a way that‚Äôs hard to put into words. I was left to raise my sons alone, haunted by thoughts of whether I had failed them. The thought of my children growing up to see me as a man who couldn‚Äôt make a better life for them weighs heavily on my mind every day.

Poverty has been my constant companion, from the day I was born until now. To this day, I‚Äôve never known the simple privacy of having my own toilet. I've always had to pay for basic needs like water, showers, and even using the bathroom. It‚Äôs a kind of existence that chips away at your dignity. This is not a life I would wish on anyone, not even my worst enemy.

There are times when I wake up and question why I‚Äôm still here. It feels like life is just a series of endless suffering, and each day is another step deeper into despair. I‚Äôve often wondered if I‚Äôm cursed‚Äîif my life was always meant to be this way, filled with one hardship after another. I long for a life where I can rest and be happy, where I can enjoy the simple pleasures that so many people take for granted: a home where I can feel safe, a steady income, and the ability to watch my children grow up without the constant fear of not having enough.

To cope with the stress and overwhelming sense of hopelessness, I turned to chewing khat. It‚Äôs not a solution, but it helps me escape, even if just for a while. When I‚Äôm sober, the reality hits harder: a life that feels like it‚Äôs going nowhere, where every effort seems to end in failure. I chew khat to dull the pain, to avoid thinking too much about all the things I‚Äôve lost and the dreams I‚Äôve had to let go. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm proud of, but at times, it feels like the only thing that helps me get through the day.

Despite everything, there is still a part of me that hopes for a better future. It may be a faint hope, but it‚Äôs there. I look at my children, and I want more for them. I want them to grow up in a world where they don‚Äôt have to struggle like I did, where they have the opportunities that I never had. I hope they grow up to be strong and find success in ways that I couldn‚Äôt. If there‚Äôs one thing I can do, it‚Äôs to teach them the value of resilience and kindness.

If you‚Äôre reading this, I hope you take a moment to be grateful for the things you have. Don‚Äôt take anything for granted. If you have a stable life, a roof over your head, and the ability to meet your needs without worry, cherish it. Not everyone is that fortunate. And if you‚Äôre someone who has never known hardship, remember that life isn‚Äôt fair for everyone. Show compassion where you can, because sometimes a little kindness can go a long way.

If you feel moved by my story and would like to support me, you can buy me a coffee. Any small gesture of kindness is deeply appreciated and helps me keep going. Here‚Äôs the link:

I recently got back from an amazing trip to Hawaii, and I've got to share my experience about finding those hidden breakfast gems that locals absolutely love. Trust me, there's so much more to Hawaiian breakfast than just hotel buffets!

During my month-long stay, I made friends with several locals who showed me their favorite breakfast spots. Let me tell you, these places are nothing like the tourist traps you'll find in Waikiki.

First off, if you're in Oahu, you absolutely need to check out Liliha Bakery. This place has been serving locals since 1950! Their butter rolls are to die for, and don't even get me started on their famous Coco Puffs. I saw more locals there at 7 AM than tourists, which is always a good sign.

Over in Maui, I discovered Grandma's Coffee House in Keokea. The locals swear by their taro pancakes and Portuguese sausage. It's a bit of a drive up the mountain, but the views are incredible, and the food is worth every mile.

One thing I noticed is that many Hawaiians love their plate lunches - even for breakfast! Places like Like Like Drive Inn (yes, that's the real name) serve traditional Hawaiian breakfast with items like spam musubi, loco moco, and Portuguese sausage with eggs.

If you're looking for something quick and local, convenience stores like Foodland and even 7-Eleven in Hawaii are surprisingly good. Local folks often grab their spam musubi and coffee there before heading to work.

Speaking of traditional Hawaiian breakfast, I've got to mention poi with fresh fish - it's a staple that many locals still enjoy, especially on weekends with family.

By the way, if you're planning a trip to Hawaii and want to experience these local spots (plus many more amazing activities), check out https://athometouch.com/hawaii. They've got some awesome food tours that'll take you to these hidden gems, plus you earn rewards for future bookings!

Here's the thing about Hawaiian breakfast spots - they're usually busy with locals before 8 AM, so go early! And don't be shy about asking the staff for recommendations. I've found that local Hawaiian people are incredibly friendly and love sharing their food culture with visitors who show genuine interest.

Oh, and here's a pro tip: many of these local spots are cash-only, so come prepared! You can book various food tours and cultural experiences through https://athometouch.com/hawaii - they often include transportation and insider knowledge from local guides.

Remember, eating where the locals eat isn't just about good food - it's about experiencing the real Hawaii and supporting local businesses. Trust me, once you've had breakfast Hawaiian style, hotel buffets will never be the same!",1,1731452655.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

#‚ñåMain stories covered:

>- **[Q3]  Philippine Airlines Q3 profit: ‚Ç±789M (down 82% y/y)...** **Philippine Airlines** [PAL 5.24 ‚ñº1.1%; 673% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=3cb022eb44cf5725abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] posted a Q3 net income of ‚Ç±789 million, down 82% y/y from its Q3/23 net income of ‚Ç±4,278 million, and down 70% q/q from its Q2/24 net income of ‚Ç±2,590 million. On a 9M basis, PAL‚Äôs net income was down 58% to ‚Ç±8,075 million. PAL declined to comment specifically on its Q3 results, but in a press release contextualized the huge drop in 9M profitability on a 3.68% drop in passenger revenues to ‚Ç±115.66 billion (down from ‚Ç±120.08 billion). PAL said that its passenger volume increased by 6.4% to 11.71 million passengers, but that its ‚Äúyield per passenger‚Äù dropped by 6.9% (not nice) ‚Äúdue to increased competition in the market.‚Äù The Tan Family‚Äôs airline noted higher cargo and ancillary revenues, but also higher consolidated operating expenses, which increased 9.5% to ‚Ç±109.7 billion. PAL attributed this increase to an uptick in round-trip flights, and maintenance expenses, which increased 12% to ‚Ç±17.5 billion. PAL President and COO, **Stanley Ng**, is quoted in the press release as saying ‚Äúwe are continuing to see a moderation in growth and a more challenging business environment where rising costs exert greater pressure on the economics of airline operations.‚Äù
>    - ***MB:*** For those who were around the PSEi trading in the 2010s and who personally witnessed PAL‚Äôs bankruptcy and emergence from that process in early 2022, the story of how this airline survived is something that sticks with you. But as entertaining as the story of an old man incinerating his billions can be, what really matters to the public float is how the stock has performed since PAL‚Äôs rise from the ashes. That‚Äôs where the bad news starts. Well, actually the bad news starts with the company‚Äôs name (which contains the word ‚Äúairlines‚Äù), but that‚Äôs a story for a different post. PAL re-debuted on the PSEi trading at around ‚Ç±6.50/share, then dropped to a ‚Ç±5.50 to ‚Ç±6.00/share range in mid-2022, and then dropped to a ‚Ç±5.00 to ‚Ç±5.50/share range in mid-2023. We‚Äôre kind of on the ugly side of that range now, with PAL having spent a number of months this year hovering gently over the ‚Ç±5.00 level. I‚Äôve had some people ask me if PAL (or its main rival, **Cebu Pacific** [CEB 31.30 ‚ñº1.7%; 135% avgVol]) form part of my middle-class thesis, and while that could have been the case with CEB back before the pandemic when planes, parts, and passengers were all plentiful and available, COVID and everything that has happened after it has shown me in clear terms that airlines are too risky for my blood. They‚Äôre so exposed. Fuel risk. Foreign exchange risk. Climate risk. Travel restriction risk. Procurement risk. Political risk. It‚Äôs just such a mess. As evidenced here by this dramatic downtick in profitability from just a small dip in passenger volume.

>- **[Q3]  Jollibee Q3 profit: ‚Ç±3.0B (up 18% y/y)...** **Jollibee** [JFC 259.40 ‚ñº0.2%; 179% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=53d78c9f1e6d8202abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] posted a Q3 net income of ‚Ç±2.98 billion, up 18% y/y from its Q3/23 net income of ‚Ç±2.53 billion, and down 6% q/q from its Q2/24 net income of ‚Ç±3.19 billion. On a 9M basis, JFC‚Äôs net income was up 23% y/y to ‚Ç±8.88 billion, its system-wide sales increased 12% to ‚Ç±281 billion, and its revenue increased 10% to ‚Ç±196 billion. Worldwide Q3 same-store sales growth was 5.7%, with the greatest gains in the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf segment (+10.7%) and the Europe, Middle East, Asia region (+10.5%). Two segments experienced same-store sales pullbacks: China (-12.1%) and Highlands Coffee (-2.5%). JFC said that it had a total of 9,598 stores globally at the end of Q3, an increase of 43% y/y thanks to the addition of 2,580 **Compose Coffee** stores and 4.4% systemwide organic growth. The Compose Coffee acquisition, which closed at the end of the third quarter, contributed 4.6% to JFC‚Äôs systemwide sales.
>    - ***MB:*** JFC‚Äôs pivot into international coffee cannot be understated, but unless JFC has its sights set on picking off one of Japan‚Äôs leading brands (Japan is the top consumer of coffee in Asia), it‚Äôs going to have to consider Indonesia for its next move. The top four coffee consumers are Japan (difficult/expensive), China (difficult), South Korea (already bought Compose Coffee), and Indonesia. One of the biggest coffee companies in Indonesia is **Kopi Kenangan**, which has recently announced its goal to become ‚Äúthe biggest coffee chain in Southeast Asia. If the bee is going to be all about the buzz, maybe its next push is in this direction. I have no special information about JFC‚Äôs strategy, and I‚Äôve not read anything to suggest that they‚Äôre planning to continue this strategy of picking off one of the biggest coffee companies in each of the coffee-craziest countries in SE Asia. But if they were, that‚Äôs an interesting place to look. Complete speculation on my part!

>- **[NEWS]  The Keepers to acquire Booze On-Line...** **The Keepers** [KEEPR 2.17 ‚ñ≤4.8%; 436% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=01ba65952e12144fabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] is planning to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of **Booze On-Line, Inc** (BOLI). According to its website ([boozeshop.ph](http://boozeshop.ph/)), BOLI is ‚Äúone of the leading companies engaged in importing and distributing global wines, spirits, and premium beers.‚Äù It is the exclusive distributor of **Hoegaarden, Stella Artois, Becks, Leffe, Paulaner, Chimay**, and **Delirium Tremenes**. BOLI‚Äôs site claims that it has ‚Äúover 350 customers around the country‚Äù, including ‚Äúkey on-premise accounts like The Distillery, Draft Gastro Pub, Olive Cerveceria, Beso Cucina Vinoteka, and Imperial Ice Bar‚Äù. KEEPR did not disclose the value of the acquisition, but indicated that it is below KEEPR‚Äôs reporting threshold (>10% KEEPR‚Äôs book value). KEEPR is owned by **Lucio Co**, and specializes in imported wines and spirits.
>    - ***MB:*** I don‚Äôt have any experience with BOLI or any special knowledge of the imported alcohol industry, but from a quick review of BOLI‚Äôs website, this looks like an acquisition that (1) consolidates KEEPR‚Äôs marketshare of certain premium spirits brands like Johnnie Walker and Jose Cuervo (among many others), and (2) smash-cuts KEEPR into the premium beer business with a collection of exclusive distributorships and what sounds like a mature sales channel for those brands. I don‚Äôt know how many of BOLI‚Äôs 350 customers are already in the KEEPR network for its premium wines and spirits. Some are bound to be redundant. But the bigger prize is that KEEPR will now have a bunch of new products that it can sling to its existing clients along its existing distribution channels. This seems like an easy add.

\*\*Genre:\*\* Romantic Sci-Fi Comedy¬†



¬†\*\*Logline:\*\* When Murrp, a clueless alien anthropologist, crash-lands in a suburban neighborhood during Thanksgiving, he enlists the help of Ellie, a single mom and aspiring chef, to blend in and experience the holiday. Sparks fly as Murrp's chaotic attempts at fitting in lead to love, hilarity, and a Thanksgiving no one will forget.



¬†¬†\*\*The Translator Medallion\*\*¬†¬†



Murrp has a medallion that translates human languages but hilariously misinterprets emotional and cultural nuances, causing chaos and comedy.



\---### \*\*Deus Ex Machina:\*\*¬†



¬†\*\*Intergalactic Rescue Drone\*\*¬†¬†



When things spiral out of control, the drone arrives just in time to fix Murrp‚Äôs ship and save the day‚Äîafter delivering an unexpected revelation.



\---### \*\*Scene Breakdown\*\*---



\*\*Scene 1: The Crash Landing\*\*¬†¬†



Murrp‚Äôs tiny, colorful spaceship crashes into Ellie‚Äôs backyard while she‚Äôs preparing for Thanksgiving dinner. Mistaking him for a costume party performer, her son, Tyler, excitedly brings him inside. Murrp nervously activates the Translator Medallion, struggling to blend in.



\### \*\*Scene 1: The Crash Landing (Continued)\*\*---



\*\*EXT. ELLIE'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\*\*¬†¬†



The backyard is dimly lit, with faint lights glowing from Ellie‚Äôs cozy suburban home. A sudden streak of green and gold cuts through the sky, followed by a loud \*WHOOSH\*. Murrp‚Äôs tiny, shimmering spaceship‚Äîa rounded, orb-like craft with iridescent panels‚Äîcrash-lands, flattening Ellie‚Äôs vegetable garden. Smoke and sparks burst from the vessel as it settles into the dirt.\*\*INT. SPACESHIP - COCKPIT\*\*¬†¬†MURRP, a small, blue, amphibian-like alien with big, curious eyes and a translucent headcrest, frantically presses glowing buttons on the control panel. His Translator Medallion around his neck glows faintly.\*\*MURRP (speaking in alien tongue, translated via medallion):



\*\*¬†¬†""Log entry 742: Subject Murrp from Uurla Prime reporting‚Äîslipstream anomaly encountered en route to Alpha G'aalr Constellation. Navigational systems... catastrophic failure. I appear to have... crash-landed on an uncharted, primitive world. Probability of hostile natives: 97.4%.""¬†¬†Murrp hesitantly peers through the cracked viewport, spotting the house nearby. Inside, warm light reveals ELLIE bustling about her kitchen, unaware of the chaos outside.¬†



¬†\---\*\*EXT. ELLIE'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\*\*¬†



¬†The spaceship hatch hisses open, releasing a plume of mist. Murrp cautiously steps out, his small frame dwarfed by the ship. He holds a compact, blinking device resembling a cross between a tricorder and a tablet.¬†¬†\*\*MURRP (to himself, through medallion):\*\*¬†¬†""Atmosphere breathable. Radiation levels negligible. Gravitational pull... slightly uncomfortable but manageable. Fascinating flora and fauna!""¬†¬†He spots a garden gnome nearby and picks it up curiously. Suddenly, a loud \*BARKING\* breaks the silence. Tyler‚Äôs small terrier, BUSTER, charges out, barking ferociously.¬†¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""Ah! A primitive predator!""¬†¬†Murrp panics, accidentally pressing a button on his device. A small holographic shield materializes around him, causing Buster to bounce harmlessly off and bark louder. The commotion draws Ellie‚Äôs attention.



\---\*\*INT. ELLIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\*\*



¬†¬†Ellie hears the barking and peers out the window, spotting the strange glow from her yard.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""Tyler! Did you let Buster out again? I told you‚Äî""¬†¬†She stops mid-sentence, squinting at the odd silhouette near the garden.¬†



¬†\---\*\*EXT. ELLIE'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\*\*¬†¬†



Ellie, now wearing a thick cardigan, cautiously steps into the backyard with a flashlight. She freezes as the beam of light lands on Murrp, who instinctively activates his Translator Medallion.\*\*MURRP (translated):\*\*¬†¬†""Greetings, Earth entity! I am Murrp of Uurla Prime, stranded due to unforeseen cosmic turbulence. I mean you no harm!""¬†¬†Ellie stares in stunned silence before the absurdity of the situation hits her.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""...Tyler, did you order some kind of alien costume online?""¬†¬†Tyler, a curious and hyperactive 10-year-old, runs out and gasps in awe.¬†¬†\*\*TYLER:\*\*¬†¬†""Whoa! Mom, it‚Äôs a \*real\* alien!""¬†¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""Yes, indeed! I am ‚Äòalien.‚Äô But, uh, friendly alien. Please do not... scream?""¬†¬†Ellie pinches the bridge of her nose, muttering to herself.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""I don‚Äôt have time for this. Thanksgiving is tomorrow, my kitchen‚Äôs a mess, and now I‚Äôve got‚Äîwhat are you, exactly?!""¬†¬†Murrp looks at his translator, which struggles to find the right words.¬†¬†\*\*MURRP (after a comedic pause):\*\*¬†¬†""A visitor here to study... your feasting customs?""¬†¬†Ellie gives him a disbelieving look, while Tyler eagerly takes Murrp by the hand.¬†¬†\*\*TYLER:\*\*¬†¬†""Can we keep him, Mom? Please? He can be my plus-one for Thanksgiving!""¬†¬†Ellie sighs, glancing between the strange creature and her son.¬†¬†



\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""Fine. You can stay. But you‚Äôre explaining to me tomorrow exactly how you ended up in my backyard. And no weird alien stuff!""¬†¬†Murrp salutes awkwardly.¬†¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""I shall assimilate flawlessly into your society! No ‚Äòweird alien stuff.‚Äô Promise.""¬†¬†He smiles, revealing glowing, tooth-like ridges, as Ellie shakes her head, muttering:¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""This is going to be a long Thanksgiving.""¬†¬†The scene fades with Tyler excitedly showing Murrp around the house while Ellie looks up at the sky, shaking her head in disbelief.¬†¬†



\*\*CUT TO:\*\* 



A comical close-up of Murrp examining the refrigerator, his face pressed against the glass like an overenthusiastic tourist.



¬†¬†\---¬†\*End of Scene 1.\*¬†¬†



\---\*\*Scene 2: Meeting Ellie\*\*



¬†¬†Ellie, overwhelmed by hosting duties, thinks Murrp is a lost actor hired for her neighbor‚Äôs Thanksgiving parade. Murrp, using the medallion, introduces himself as ""Murrp the Researcher of Sentient Feasts,"" but the device hilariously mistranslates. Ellie decides to help him stay hidden until the parade.



\### \*\*Scene 2: Meeting Ellie (Continued)\*\*---



\*\*INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\*\*The living room is a mix of cozy chaos‚ÄîThanksgiving decorations are half-finished, with streamers and a decorative cornucopia scattered on the coffee table. Tyler is perched on the couch, gleefully explaining Earth holidays to MURRP, who is holding a stuffed turkey decoration upside down, studying it intently.¬†



¬†\*\*TYLER:\*\*¬†¬†""Thanksgiving is awesome! There‚Äôs a big feast, and everyone eats until they can‚Äôt move. Oh, and football! And pie. Lots of pie!""¬†¬†\*\*MURRP (translated):\*\*¬†¬†""Ah, a communal gluttony ritual to celebrate... gratitude? How quaintly paradoxical.""¬†¬†Ellie enters, holding a mug of coffee and eyeing Murrp with suspicion.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""Okay, alien guy, let‚Äôs get something straight. You can‚Äôt just crash-land in my backyard and start playing house. Who even are you?""¬†¬†Murrp awkwardly adjusts his Translator Medallion, standing up to face Ellie.¬†¬†



\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""I am Murrp of Uurla Prime, Researcher of Sentient Feasts, Observer of Cosmic Cuisine. I was en route to the Alpha G‚Äôaalr Constellation to study their famed Feast of Thousand Stars. Unfortunately, I encountered a slipstream anomaly and... \*ker-crash!\*""¬†¬†He mimics an explosion with his hands, complete with an enthusiastic sound effect.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE (raising an eyebrow):\*\*¬†¬†""So, you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre here to study... Thanksgiving?""¬†¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""Yes! Your holiday aligns perfectly with my research objectives. I shall learn your customs, document your traditions, and avoid detection by hostile natives.""¬†¬†Ellie folds her arms, skeptical.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†



¬†""Right. And what happens if the 'hostile natives'‚Äîa.k.a. my nosy neighbor, Mrs. Harrington‚Äîfind you?""¬†¬†\*\*MURRP (with determination):\*\*¬†¬†""I shall deploy evasive maneuvers and... hide behind the ‚Äòcouch.‚Äô""¬†¬†He gestures dramatically to the couch, causing Tyler to burst into laughter. Ellie sighs and pinches the bridge of her nose.¬†¬†---\*\*INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\*\*¬†¬†Ellie leads Murrp into the kitchen, where stacks of ingredients are scattered across the counter. She starts sorting through them while Murrp marvels at Earth appliances.¬†¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""Such fascinating technology! What is the purpose of this... cylindrical storage capsule?""¬†¬†He points to a can of cranberry sauce.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""It‚Äôs cranberry sauce. You eat it.""¬†¬†Murrp picks up the can, shaking it near his ear.¬†



¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""Curious. It makes no sound. Is it broken?""¬†¬†Ellie snatches the can back.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""Look, if you‚Äôre staying here, you need to blend in. No more weird alien antics. And absolutely no touching the turkey!""¬†¬†Murrp peers at the raw turkey on the counter, leaning in close.¬†¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""Ah, the centerpiece of your feast. A noble sacrifice! What a peculiar species you humans are.""¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""It‚Äôs just dinner, okay? Now, sit down, and let me think about how I‚Äôm going to deal with this.""¬†¬†Murrp looks for a chair but instead sits cross-legged on the floor, causing Ellie to groan.¬†¬†---\*\*INT. DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT\*\*¬†¬†Tyler sets the table while Ellie watches Murrp fumble with a fork and knife, trying to figure them out.¬†¬†



\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""These primitive tools are... inefficient. How does one efficiently dismantle food with such instruments?""¬†¬†\*\*TYLER:\*\*¬†¬†""You mean eat? Like this!""¬†¬†Tyler picks up a drumstick from leftover chicken and mimics chomping it. Murrp attempts to copy him but bites into the napkin instead.¬†¬†Ellie stifles a laugh but quickly hides it behind her coffee mug.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""Okay, first lesson of Thanksgiving: don‚Äôt eat the napkins.""¬†¬†



\---\*\*INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\*\*¬†¬†



Ellie settles on the couch with a weary sigh, flipping through her notebook filled with recipe ideas. Murrp sits next to her, holding one of her cookbooks upside down.¬†¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""Your species‚Äô culinary diversity is... staggering. So many combinations of flavors and textures! My people could learn much from you, Ellie.""¬†¬†Ellie glances at him, surprised.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""Thanks... I guess. Cooking‚Äôs kind of my thing. Always has been.""¬†¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""Ah, a master of feasting rituals! Most impressive.""¬†¬†Ellie chuckles softly, the first hint of her warming up to him.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""Yeah, sure. Master of rituals. Look, Murrp, if you want to stick around, you‚Äôre going to need to help me. Thanksgiving isn‚Äôt just about food‚Äîit‚Äôs about family and community. And right now, we‚Äôve got a lot to do before tomorrow.""¬†



¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""I am eager to assist! What tasks shall I perform?""¬†¬†Ellie smirks.¬†¬†\*\*ELLIE:\*\*¬†¬†""For starters, you can peel the potatoes.""¬†¬†Murrp nods solemnly, saluting her with the peeler.¬†¬†\*\*MURRP:\*\*¬†¬†""Consider it done, Commander Ellie.""¬†¬†Ellie rolls her eyes but smiles as Murrp struggles to figure out the peeler. Tyler giggles in the background, and for the first time, Ellie feels like maybe, just maybe, this bizarre alien visitor might not be so bad after all.¬†¬†\*\*FADE OUT.\*\*¬†¬†---¬†\*End of Scene 2.



\*---\*\*Scene 3: Learning Thanksgiving Traditions\*\*¬†¬†Murrp tags along with Ellie and Tyler to a grocery store, where his misunderstanding of turkey, cranberries, and pumpkin spice leads to several slapstick moments. Ellie starts to find Murrp‚Äôs earnestness and curiosity charming.



\---\*\*Scene 4: A Thanksgiving Fiasco\*\*¬†¬†



Back home, Murrp tries to ""help"" cook but misunderstands recipes due to his translator. He ends up creating a bizarre but delicious alien twist on stuffing that becomes an instant hit with her guests. Ellie starts warming up to his quirky nature.



\---\*\*Scene 5: The Neighbor's Suspicion\*\*¬†



¬†Ellie‚Äôs nosy neighbor, Mrs. Harrington, grows suspicious of Murrp‚Äôs strange behavior. She sets up a camera to expose him, leading to a series of comedic close calls as Murrp fumbles through human customs.---



\*\*Scene 6: A Heartfelt Connection\*\*¬†¬†



Late at night, Murrp and Ellie share a quiet moment on the porch. Murrp reveals his mission to learn about Earth‚Äôs ""feasting rituals"" to save his planet from monotony. Ellie opens up about her struggles as a single mom and her dream of becoming a chef. Sparks fly.---\*\*Scene 7: The Parade Disaster\*\*¬†¬†Murrp gets roped into participating in the Thanksgiving parade. His Translator Medallion malfunctions mid-speech, causing him to blurt out alien gibberish. The crowd panics, thinking he‚Äôs an invader. Ellie quickly improvises, claiming it‚Äôs part of the act.



\---\*\*Scene 8: Mrs. Harrington's Revelation\*\*¬†¬†Mrs. Harrington posts the footage online, and it goes viral. Authorities arrive, threatening to detain Murrp. Ellie, Tyler, and their neighbors band together to protect him, claiming he‚Äôs an innocent actor from out of town.



\---\*\*Scene 9: The Deus Ex Machina\*\*¬†¬†

Filter: fellow ode gen 2 with SSP MP burrs
Espresso: df64p with SSP MP burrs

I‚Äôm looking for something with high clarity. I know the fellow ode with ssp mp should achieve this but my experience with it has been a little lack luster. I drink both filter and espresso but generally favor filter coffee more so I‚Äôm looking for a grinder/burrs that are optimized for pourovers. However if the grinder can do espresso well enough I may get rid of both grinders and just keep 1. My budget is around $1500.
Here are the options I‚Äôm looking at in no particular order

1. Timemore Sculptor 078
2. DF83 with SSP HU or brew burrs
3. Zerno Grinder (although it wouldn‚Äôt arrive til Aprilüò≠)

Let's Talk About What They Actually Mean,"We've all seen them - Bible verses on Instagram posts, coffee mugs, and wall art. But are we missing their real meaning?

Take Philippians 4:13 - ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" Often used as a motivational quote for achieving goals, but here's the twist: Paul wrote this while in prison, talking about being content in suffering, not about crushing your goals.

Or the famous ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart"" (Proverbs 3:5-6). We quote it when life's good, but what about when trusting feels impossible? When the path isn't straight at all?

Let's look at some commonly quoted verses:

John 3:16:

* What we think it means: ""Believe and you're good""
* Deeper meaning: God's radical love and sacrifice

""The Lord is my shepherd"" (Psalm 23):

* Instagram version: Peaceful meadows and good vibes
* Reality: Written during intense hardship, about finding peace in chaos

Romans 8:28 (""All things work together for good""):

* Often used as: ""Everything happens for a reason!""
* Actually about: God's ability to redeem even our darkest moments

This raises some interesting questions:

* How has your understanding of these verses changed over time?
* Which verses hit different when you learned their context?
* How do we balance popular interpretations with deeper meaning?
* What verses do you think are most misunderstood today?

1gpxydr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1gpxydr/what_are_some_good_hawaii_souvenirs/,What Are Some Good Hawaii Souvenirs?,"Hey there fellow Redditors! I just got back from an amazing trip to Hawaii, and I thought I'd share some awesome souvenir ideas I discovered while island hopping. Trust me, you'll want to avoid those tacky tourist traps and get something truly special.

First off, let me tell you about Hawaiian coffee ‚Äì particularly Kona coffee. This stuff is liquid gold! I picked up several bags from local farms, and it's honestly ruined regular coffee for me forever. The smooth, rich flavor is unmatched, and it makes for a perfect gift.

Another gem I found was Hawaiian macadamia nuts. Sure, they might seem obvious, but get them from local markets rather than big chain stores. I found some amazing flavored varieties like honey-glazed and chocolate-covered ones that were absolutely divine.

Local crafts are where it's really at though. I discovered beautiful handmade quilts (called Hawaiian quilts) with traditional patterns. They're pricey but totally worth it as a forever keepsake. Same goes for authentic Hawaiian jewelry ‚Äì the traditional hook necklaces and bracelets made from local materials are stunning.

Speaking of traditional items, you can't go wrong with a high-quality ukulele. Just make sure you're getting one that's actually made in Hawaii ‚Äì there are lots of cheaper knockoffs out there.

Before my trip, I booked some local craft workshops through this awesome site: https://athometouch.com/viator. It was such a cool experience learning to make traditional lei necklaces and watching artisans create beautiful Koa wood products. These experiences helped me understand which souvenirs were authentic and worth buying.

If you're into food stuff like me, don't sleep on Hawaiian sea salt, local honey, and dried fruit. I got this amazing pineapple-infused honey that's basically happiness in a jar. Also grabbed some Hawaiian shirt cookies ‚Äì they're these adorable shortbread cookies shaped like aloha shirts!

One of my favorite finds was locally made skin care products. Hawaiian ingredients like kukui nut oil, coconut oil, and volcanic clay make for some seriously amazing stuff. My skin has never been happier!

For those who want something unique, I'd recommend checking out some local art galleries. I found beautiful prints of Hawaiian landscapes and traditional designs that look amazing framed. If you're not sure where to find the best galleries and local shops, check out some guided cultural tours at https://athometouch.com/viator ‚Äì they really know their stuff!

Oh, and here's a pro tip: save some room in your suitcase for Hawaiian snacks! Li hing mui (dried plum powder) and chocolate-covered macadamia nuts make great gifts. I'm currently rationing my last bag of taro chips because they're just that good.

Just remember, the best souvenirs are the ones that really capture the spirit of Hawaii. Skip the mass-produced stuff and go for items made by local artisans or small businesses. Your friends and family will appreciate the thought you put into finding something special, and you'll have meaningful mementos of your Hawaiian adventure.

Anyone else have some cool Hawaii souvenir finds to share? I'd love to hear about them in the comments!",1,1731451878.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

1gpxxkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1gpxxkm/its_weird_knowing_that_im_going_to_be_homeless/,It‚Äôs weird knowing that I‚Äôm going to be homeless again ,"So when I was a junior in college, I was a commuter and left the family to couch hop, sleep in my car, and finally receive emergency housing for two months - I even managed to have a short term apartment. When you really want something, you‚Äôll do what you need to do to make it work. 

Well  I graduated this year, and I honestly didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be in this situation again. On paper, I did everything right- I got my degree, found a full time job in my field right after college, I scored an apartment with some roomies.

But then things started to fall apart- I won‚Äôt get into the details, but wow, being a young adult is tough. 

It feels like I have two options. I could keep going, live paycheck to paycheck making $21 an hour with a degree and five years of experience in the field, and keep my apartment. 

Or, I can save the extra 1200 a month, and put it into my savings. How? My beautiful amazing car- she‚Äôs not new, but when I originally slept in my car I had a smaller sedan. Now, I have a lil SUV (because I was paranoid about homelessness‚Ä¶ i guess I was right haha)

I feel like socially, this is going to suck. I can‚Äôt invite people over, I know I won‚Äôt be looked at in the best light when making new friends. It‚Äôs going to be very isolating - especially working 40 hours a week and not having a place to come home to. 

But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the benefits. If I do this, if I give up my lease and live in my car until I‚Äôm happy with my savings again, I have nothing to tie me down. 

I‚Äôm filled with this anxiety - of ‚Äúwhat if I get let go tomorrow‚Äù. Then I‚Äôm really homeless and broke. 

For me, doing this is in a small way to take back control of my life. If I can‚Äôt find a better paying job- literally was rejected from a coffee chain- then I need to find a way to create a financial buffer which will give me peace of mind and lessen my day to day anxiety. 

I know it‚Äôs not ideal. My friends don‚Äôt like the idea. All I know is that we live in hard times, so all we can do right now is create a plan and see what happens. 

If someone is also going through something similar, I feel for you. Maybe we can connect and go through this together. 

Anyways, UCI kiddos, I did it all right- and I‚Äôm still left in a very uncomfortable situation. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up, it‚Äôs not your fault, it‚Äôs the state of our world. We just need to adjust, and find a way to make the best of it. 

With love! <3
