1j8aweu,https://i.redd.it/n8pvonu6rxne1.jpeg,Just wanted to give you Guys a quick review of the Madrinas Coffee cup and Mix!,"Bought this a while back when this collab first launched, and man everything from the shipping box it came in to the cup itself is gorgeous! Their designs (Madrinas) are all great however the coffee mix itself is‚Ä¶ well. 

So the cup is a shaker cup which, judging from my experience is made pretty well. There‚Äôs a little diffuser device you put in before you screw on the lid so the water/milk and mix can all mix up well and it does a great job. And while I love the cup and all the designs, I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about the drink itself lol. This is the first I‚Äôve heard of Madrinas but I‚Äôve since subbed to their newsletter and they seem to have lots of great game collabs. However I‚Äôm not sure if Imm making this right. 

The flavor of the mix is ‚Äúwhite chocolate mocha‚Äù which is usually my go-to Starbucks order and favorite all/round flavor for most milky drinks. I swore I‚Äôd love this but I found myself‚Ä¶ kinda disgusted. It has a taste similar to any water-based protein shake or pre workout which I mean, sure but this thing isn‚Äôt healthy. At all. It has a TON of sugar, calories and carbs. I don‚Äôt get why it doesn‚Äôt taste better. (I mixed per the instructions on the container) Which was like a cup of water and 4 scoops of the mix. It really isn‚Äôt all that when mixed that way. 

I have yet to try other methods but anyone else know how to make it taste better? I really wanna like it lol. But in the meantime, this cup makes for a killer shaker cup at the gym or on walks haha. I can‚Äôt express my love for it enough. I do think it‚Äôs on the pricey side for what you get but the quality is as great ss these things come and you can‚Äôt expect anything cheaper especially for video game collabs.

I just wanted to hop on here and say the plot for thought has successfully finished its first book! Thank you to all who have participated in our reading of An American Tragedy. We now move on to As I Lay Dying, by William Faulkner. 

  
Since this book is significantly shorter than the one we just finished, it will be one session only. We will discuss the entire novel on March 30th, 11:00 at Sayfani Coffee in Allen. This means that we will also be preparing for the next novel in April. Right now it is looking like we will read The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt.

  
Thank you everyone for showing up for this and I am excited to keep the journey going!

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

An appropriate approach may be a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts¬¥.

1j8acbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rosacea/comments/1j8acbh/26_year_red_flushed_face_and_my_progress_with/,26 year red flushed face and my progress with undecylenic acid,"It‚Äôs been a long journey and it‚Äôs still ongoing, but I believe I am making more progress currently than I ever have to find the root cause of my issues. I only made this progress by looking in other forums and connecting together a series of other symptoms that I have had over the last two decades
My primary issue has always been extreme type 2 redness covering all of my face including my ears, nose and cheeks. Typical triggers would flare the redness to fire engine red. However I also had or currently had over the years:
-gut issues/ constipation/diarrhea/  hemorrhoids/gas/bloating
-depression/anxiety/doom outlook
- hearing loss/much worse in one ear
-sinus allergy symptoms year round but much worse in spring
-dandruff mild
-back and joint pain since my early 30‚Äôs
-allergies to dozens of foods, most trees, grasses, and many others that the doctors could think of a blood test for. 

 Long story shortened, I tied all my symptoms together and candida kept popping up as a common theme.  I have not been tested for candida since my primary doctor does not want to hear about anything fungal.  I have moved past doctors and begun treating myself for candida and stomach problems that are manifesting itself in my case as a permanently red flushed face.  
The natural treatments of garlic, black seed oil, oregano oil, etc. gave me little glimpses of minor improvements but nothing remotely close to what I‚Äôm seeing in one week of using undecylenic acid.  

I have worked my way up to 3-4 pills 2-3 times a day so far. This dosage or weeks time frame has changed my ears back to a normal flesh color as of last night.  My nose and cheeks have also lightened as these are the reddest parts of my face.  I believe for the first time ever that I may have figured out the root cause and am actually winning. 

If you have been told in the past by doctors that you have adult acne, rosacea and that they have no idea what‚Äôs going on please look into gut issues being your root cause.  It took me 26 years to make the connection.  I always thought it was coffee, chocolate, pizza and many other things combined with sunlight or cold weather that destroyed my face.  

If this progess continues undecylenic acid the root cause of my issues will be from a yeast overgrowth.  This probably started as a result of many antibiotics as a child for ear infections which sparked off teen acne.  I then moved through dermatologists who had me on antibiotics for years for the acne before finally finishing off my gut biome with accutane.  

Move to my 20‚Äôs with moderate alcohol, living on my own with a high carbohydrate, sugar and processed food diet.  All the while feeding the candida overgrowth and one symptom after another kept adding up until its systemic current form. 

Too many things to list that I have tried over the years to fix this.  However, a few are topical and oral ivermectin, fenbendazole, doxycycline, 4-5 day water fasts and food elimination diets. 

I will update as I progress to the recommended undecylenic acid dosage. One of my other symptoms that I wanted to add but can not edit the top of this post, is chronic fatigue.  This has plagued me as well as the red flushed face from the beginning.  I go to bed, sleep for 7-8 hours but never wake feeling rested.  I also haven‚Äôt dreamt in 26 years or had the ability to recall any of them if I in fact was dreaming.  

Anyways please look into and join the Candida sub Reddit if you have other symptoms other than a red flushed faced. I‚Äôm willing to bet many of us have undiagnosed gut issues that are our root problem. Doctors will only talk predominantly about bacterial causes and not fungal.  Their medical training is split 70-80% for bacterial and 20-30% for fungal.

1j8a921,https://i.redd.it/234exbv8mxne1.png,Bishops letter,"I got the letter from the bishop about my mother's Temple ceiling cancellation request. I'm pretty sure I'm just going to respond with something like let my mother do whatever she wants to do and that should be it. I just wanted to share what the church does with other exmos like me. If you have suggestions of a response for the bishop then I'd love to hear them. I mostly just like the dialogue with other like-minded people. 

I will give you a little background just so you know. Mom and dad got married in the templein the late '60s. Supposedly mom caught dad smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee a couple weeks prior to their marriage. She wanted to not marry him after that. In fact she didn't want to marry him in the first place but he was the only one that asked her at the very old age of about 21. 21 is too old to not be married in the Mormon church. 

Anyway they went ahead and got married. I guess they just stayed together because that's what you do. Supposedly mom asked her Bishop if she could divorce my dad at a couple different times during their marriage. Every time the bishop said go home and work it out. From what I understand she even had an affair hoping that that would get her out of this marriage. The bishop said no, go home and work it out. 

Dad always worked away from home he was only home on the weekends. Mom took care of the house and Dad provided the money. Dad was never abusive. in fact he loved my mother dearly from what I could tell. Mom met some guy doing a geocache thing about 20 years ago. She fell for this guy whilst remaining married to my dad and still doing all their Church things. She started dating this guy. I don't think they were having sex but they sure were doing a lot of things that you don't do when you're married to another man. He eventually moved into my childhood home and lived with my mother and my dad. 

My parents sold that home and moved it somewhere else and he came right along with them. I was vehemently against any of this. I was yelling and screaming to all of her family members and all of my dad's family members at the time. Dad was just complacent saying that he loved my mother and whatever she wanted to do she could do. 

This guy converted to Mormonism somewhere along the way. I guess about 10 years ago my mother divorced my father. Not long afterwards she married this other guy.  My father went live with my brother for the last couple years of his life and passed away about 7 years ago. I think the divorce literally killed my dad. Just talking about this stuff is bringing up emotions that are very hard to deal with. 

I don't think the new husbands intentions have ever been good. He didn't have any money and he was in a lot of debt when he met my mom. My parents did pretty well in life my dad worked several jobs and made good investments. I honestly believe this guy is in it for the money. Some will say it's a stretch but that's not how I see it. 

He is very controlling of my mother. She can't spend a dollar without letting him know. It was the exact opposite when she was married to my father. She told my dad what to do. He just handed over the checks.

Needless to say I don't like this guy that my mother is with now. He doesn't like me either.  In order for me to continue seeing my mother though I have to kind of pretend and be cordial with him. He's probably 15 years younger than my mom. I know if he outlives my mom that any inheritance I won't get. Frankly I don't care. I'm just putting that out there because that's the kind of person this guy is. My mom paid off all of his debts helped him to sell his condo that he was defaulting on and encouraged him to get a much better job. Dad just signed the divorce papers when my mom gave them to him. Essentially dad got to keep nothing. He gave her the house he got my dad's truck and almost all of his money kept flowing to my mom and the new husband.

Dad quit drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes right after my mom caught him before they got married. As far as I can tell Dad was a stalwart member of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints. He was the high priest group leader he went to all his meetings. He did all his home teaching and from what I can tell full on was committed to the MFMC. If I still believed I might question why the temple  divorce take place? Dad did nothing wrong then I can tell. I do love my mother and I guess if it'll make her happy for the last couple years of her life then who am I to question it?

It is truly a mess of epic proportions. There's lots of other drama that I don't need to go into now. I don't like this guy. I don't hate him because I don't hate anyone. I want to tell the bishop, Do  you know how bad the church has screwed up my mother's life? My mom won't go near water she thinks the devil reigns over the water. To the point she doesn't even like to get in the shower. She has never been someone that wanted to go swimming or on a boat or anything like that. Superstition from the church. 

She is hoarded food as long as I can remember. Her biggest fear is that something will happen to her food storage. She told me she had a nightmare that someone stole it all and woke up in a panic. Meanwhile I don't know how much food has been just thrown away because she buys it and then it goes bad and then 10 years later it all gets thrown away and she's buying more. I figured it up that my parents must have given a million dollars to the church over the years. That's just hiding not counting fast offerings and all the other crap they just gave to them. Besides all their time efforts energy etc. 

Sorry this got a little long and it might not read real well because I'm trying to just get this all written down. I tend to just talk when I'm doing talk to text. I forget my punctuation. So once again forgive me. Maybe this will help me to heal a little bit. Most of the time I just push it down and let it go. When my kids were young she tried to force them to call the new husband Grandpa. I was constantly having to correct her and them and say no that's not your grandpa. Even after my dad passed away she was trying to get them to do that. And I would say your grandpa isn't with us anymore. 

Mom has confided into me multiple times that she thought dad was a very good husband and father. Perhaps this has something to do with the new husband forcing her to get a temple divorce from my dad. If I look at it from my mom's logic none of all this matters anyway because God is going to sort it all out in the end. Regardless of what anyone does here on Earth God will sort it all out in the end so that we're all content and happy. Which the gates any of it anyway. I'll probably respond to the bishop tonight or in the morning. 

 Any of your thoughts or wisdom or anything is greatly appreciated. I will read it all and answer any questions when I can. This little subreddit or Reddit has been wonderful for me. It's nice to have a little family that understands and doesn't judge or anything like that. I hope everybody's having a good day.

Before the next commercial began, I muted the TV. The Nullborn had managed to do *that* to Zamora Himself? I pulled out my phone and quickly searched for any data on the attack. Huh. It seemed the issue was fixed within a few hours. The Nine were efficient, if nothing else.

I checked the duty roster for the next day. I had fifty-seven employees to chaperone this time. I sighed and shook my head. I really wished they‚Äôd let me have an assistant. Anybody would do, even one of the SanRec kids. I‚Äôd have to bring it up in Monday‚Äôs meeting.

I looked at my plate, only now realizing it was empty. Damn. I‚Äôd paid good money for that sandwich, only to have the joy of eating real meat and vegetables stolen by a shitty newsreel. Fifty thousand credits down the Nine-damned drain.

Grumbling, I took my plate to the sink and rinsed it off, placing it in the rack to dry. I was about to go back to my room when a knock sounded at the door. When I opened it, there was nobody there. I looked up and down the street, seeing no movement and hearing no sounds other than the occasional drone fly-by.

Turning back to my door, there was a note affixed with a glob of security glue.

*Citizen:*

*Your monthly protection payment of 75,000 credits is due. Failure to transfer the funds by tomorrow morning will result in a forfeiture of Ironclad Security‚Äôs attention.*

*Please remit payment promptly.*

*Order Through Strength*

Dammit. I thought I‚Äôd paid that one. I snatched the note from the door and it began dissolving into a soft putty. Knowing it would decompose in a matter of minutes, I tossed it into the sink and pulled up my bank app. Still hovering at fifteen million in debt. Not bad. I could work with this.

Approving another hundred thousand credit loan was thankfully easy. Credits in hand, I wired the money to Ironclad and paid my grocery bill for the next month. It would take some serious overtime to pay this down, but I was sure I could do it in the next month.   
  
It was a good thing I had been rendered sterile as a kid, or I‚Äôd have even more issues to worry about. Vanguard may have saved my life -at *significant* cost, mind you- but I‚Äôd never be able to bear a child of my own.

I walked back to my room and pulled up my book app. Time to relax.

/\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*/

*Angela? It‚Äôs time to wake up. Your shift begins in approximately an hour.*

I groaned and sat up, the sheet falling to my waist. ‚ÄúThanks, Cosmo.‚Äù

*You are welcome Angela. Your ten-minute shower will start in thirty seconds. I shall have your breakfast ready when you get out.*

I nodded and shuffled off to the bathroom, where the water had just begun to fall. I had just finished rinsing when the water trickled off, and I dried off, wrapping a separate towel around my long hair.

The *ding* from the reconstituter alerted me to my morning ration, and I ate mechanically, not worrying about tasting anything. I dropped my empty bowl into the recycler, and got dressed.

‚ÄúCosmo? How much time do I have?‚Äù

*Your shift begins in thirty-seven minutes, ma‚Äôam.*

I grimaced. Not enough time for a coffee, then. ‚ÄúThanks Cosmo.‚Äù I hurried out to the train station, and boarded the early line. The train was full of passengers, some who smelled like they hadn‚Äôt showered in *days*. I stood off to the side of the door and took hold of the rail above me for the entire fifteen minute ride. Thankfully, nobody bothered me today.

After one of the Disconnected somehow gained access to the train and rode all the way to the Hub, Ironclad and AetherNet had beefed up security. People were terrified to even *look* at another passenger, now. *Nobody* wanted Ironclad‚Äôs attention.

Which was perfect for me. I didn‚Äôt want to deal with people, and honestly? I had no time even for *friends*. It was just as well that I was left alone. The train stopped near work, and I exited, heading up the stairs. I heard the welcome message in my ear as I walked through the doors.

*Welcome to work, Angela. You‚Äôre fifteen minutes early! The Forgefather smiles upon your dedication and sacrifice.*

I took a deep breath and walked up to my office, which overlooked the Reclamation floor. Hopefully these idiots could be trusted to not kill themselves or each other for the next thirteen hours.

As luck would have it, my desk had a stack of receipts and invoices to go through; all of which needed my attention. I placed my bag down and got to work, picking up the first sheet of paper, which wound up being a time sheet report for the management.

I shook my head ruefully. Why did we still keep track of time like this? Our AetherNet devices all ping back to the network with our locations every five seconds. They *knew* we were here. Paperwork was little more than a formality at this point. Still, I had a job to do. And if they were going to pay me to double-check the paperwork against the electronic record, who was I to argue? It was just insufferably boring. I pulled up the program on my computer and cross-referenced yesterday‚Äôs attendance and times with the papers, and found no discrepancies. *As usual*. That task done, I picked up the next bundle and flipped through them. Complaints and requisition requests.

*Sector 5, row 2, column 2*

*Drop door malfunctioned and sent Employee 0003582722 to the incinerator. Next of Kin notified. Replacement hired 33 minutes later.*

Ugh. *Another* death. After we‚Äôd sent a maintenance team to that drop door four times this month already. I‚Äôd liked Kenny. He was funny, sometimes. I put that one in a ‚Äúfollow-up‚Äù pile.

*Sector 7 - General request*

*Gloves needed for the handling of caustic waste. Employee 0003581399 has complained about chemical burns to hands. Request denied. Caustic waste at acceptable risk levels.*

Poor Jen. She‚Äôd had issues in Sector 7 for months. The AI kept dropping the wrong materials over there since just after she got hired. Hazardous wastes were supposed to be processed in Sector 9. *They* were equipped for that. I put a request for her to get hazard pay, since the burns were starting to scar.

On and on it went, sifting through the various complaints and problems my team kept experiencing. Some, I was able to do something about, like Jen‚Äôs hands, but most of it? I was powerless. Just another pencil-pusher in this monstrosity of a system.

I stopped midway through my shift to eat a quick snack of soy protein and a couple of multivitamins, then put my head down and went back to work, slogging through the endless reports and requests. Some were easy to deal with, but others I had to pass up the chain or over to the laughable HR team to deal with.

Like *they* were going to be able to stop Mike from getting handsy with Sheila. I‚Äôd warned him several times in the past about keeping his hands to himself, but he didn‚Äôt seem to care. Even when I‚Äôd had him fined a half million credits, he just kept going. I shook my head and placed that one in the escalation pile. Let‚Äôs see. Next was‚Ä¶ oh?

*Altercation between Employee 0003561923 and Employee 0003561927.*

Employee 0003561927 terminated and suggested for Disconnection due to destroying company property.*

*Property damaged: One (1) pair of TitanWorks Mining Gloves.*    
*Reason: Contamination with Employee 0003561923‚Äôs blood, and sent into the incinerator.*

Well. Looks like Sheila had had enough of Mike‚Äôs bullshit. Good for her. But now, she was suggested for *Disconnection* of all things. For being human and having enough of someone else‚Äôs unwanted advances? I submitted a recommendation for counseling, instead. Sure, she‚Äôd have to reimburse the company for destroying Mike‚Äôs gloves, but at least this way she would *live*.

I shuddered, thinking about being Disconnected. To have your debt wiped out? Awesome. Great. To be removed from all records of existence? Not so awesome. The Disconnected were scrubbed so cleanly from society you‚Äôd question if you ever even *knew* them, even though they might be your sister or best friend. Your AetherNet devices were locked and no amount of begging would turn them back on. You lost all access to every single part of what made this world livable.

In short, you were a *ghost*. Free range for anyone to do anything at all they wanted with you. This was why the Church kindly gave the Disconnected a week‚Äôs worth of shelter and food, before turning them loose in the Dead Zones. Only the truly strong survived there.

I shook myself from my mental meanderings and got back to my reports. I really hoped Sheila would be able to stay away from Disconnection.

The smiling face of Dashanti Ibramov flashed onto the screen. ‚ÄúAnd now we turn to Pierre Gustav with world news. Pierre?‚Äù

I took a bite of my sandwich. The lettuce crunched delightfully as I tore off the small chunk, chewing appreciatively. The taste of tomatoes coupled with real bacon was always blissful.

*‚ÄúNull hackers broke into a minor security mainframe and managed to wipe the debt of seventy million civilians and somehow dumped it all into the account of Gideon Zamora himself, totaling almost a quadrillion credits.‚Äù*

My hands froze as I took another bite.

Seventy *million* people? And almost a *quadrillion* in debt? I put the sandwich down and leaned forward, my attention on the screen.

‚ÄúAuthorities are working round the clock to return the debt back to whom it rightfully belongs, and to clear Zamora‚Äôs good name.‚Äù

Mindlessly, I ate the rest of my sandwich as I watched the news.

‚ÄúThat sounds terrible, Pierre. I hope those citizens can recover their debts. Do the authorities have any leads on the particular group of Nullborn who mounted this attack?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Dashanti, they don‚Äôt. What‚Äôs particularly concerning are the messages left in each account.‚Äù

‚ÄúMessages? What do they say?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe same message was left in each account, Dashanti. ‚Äò*Debt is a shackle, a travesty of the highest order. You are free, and we hope you come home.*‚Äô The authorities are working on a meaning.‚Äù

Words like chocolate, caramel, coffee, etc should never be used to describe skin. Instead we should use words like mahogany, hazelnut, redwood, walnut, oak, etc. So I'm thinking, describing people as LUMBER is better? I'm looking at it as a Romance writer of BWWM stories, which are about attraction, and to me food descriptors are far sexier.  And at some point in a romance story, someone is going to put their mouth on someone else, and I'm thinking it's better to have food in your mouth than a 2x4.

With that said, I want to stress that I'm thinking strictly from the romance aspect. If it's a non-romance detective novel or something like that, I wouldn't want to be described as chocolate. Because there is definitely a sexual aspect to food descriptors such as chocolate or caramel.",3,1741642503.0,RomanceWriters,3,1.0,False

1j8a3f8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j8a3f8,My Stay at the Thompson Palm Springs,"Overall a great stay for the Indian Wells tennis tournament with breakfast being the worst part of the stay. I‚Äôm sure as a new property it‚Äôs just new property kinks to work out.
¬†
LOCATION A
Great location in DT PS. Lots of restaurants and shopping around. We used it to walk to the casino nearby. We also played golf at Indian Canyon golf resort which was only a 15 min drive. We were attending the Indian Wells Open, so that was about a 40 minute drive away.

VIBE A
More of a modern art, a little eclectic kind of vibe. The vibe at Lola Rose was great, the rooms decorated with a bit of vintage aesthetic. I loved walking to the rooms, it was completely quiet from the noise at Lola Rose and felt like a desert oasis on a roof top. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 

ROOM A
Rooms were light on decor, but still had a theme going for it. I was a fan of the small details with the lamps and the vintage radio. Otherwise, pretty basic decor overall. Bed was comfy!¬†We were on the third floor in a king room with no balcony (an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù in their eyes), not too far from Lola Rose but we didn‚Äôt hear any noise from our room

BREAKFAST C
Breakfast was by far our worst experience. We came during a busy weekend and sat down during a busy period. We were told that Globalists get to order whatever they want off the menu without limit. Later on, we found out this simply wasn't the case (1 entree, 1 coffee, 1 juice). In addition, our server kept forgetting to put our orders in correctly (wife got the wrong kind of coffee drink and had to reorder and of course that was billed to us). We sat down at 9:20AM and didn't leave until 11AM (super late to the tennis tournament we were attending). The food pretty much came around 10:30AM and we had to scarf it all down to try to leave on time. It felt like the food was prepared earlier, but our server forgot to bring it to us since it was cold. I got the wagyu burger and felt like it was pretty mid. Fries that came with it were cold but had potential. ¬†I will say, we had Lola Rose for dinner the night before and that was an enjoyable experience. They sat 8 of us with a last second reservation and the food was fantastic.

VALUE A
We got in before the upgraded tier so during a peak weekend, it was 23,000 points which is super worth it. I think the category 6 pricing is appropriate just based on what I've seen happening around SoCal. Would change the value to B for the new pricing probably.

AMENITIES A
There was a nice gym, two heated pools on the rooftop, pool side bar, hot tub jacuzzi. Great for palm springs!¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 

SERVICE B
Service was great all around except for the breakfast service.
¬†
Overall, I would stay again! I just hope breakfast has worked itself out better next time.",15,1741642410.0,hyatt,3,1.0,False

I'm KJ, a digital marketing professional, currently serving as a Marketing Director for $M Client. And yes I'm a 6-Digit earner and millionaire. I owned a coffee shop (worth 500k) earning P30-40k per passively month, located somewhere within hospital premises in NCR. Serving 1 client ever since.

I started E-Commerce back end of 2020 using Facebook Ads, sold few thousand and earn 6 digits. If nababalitaan nyo yung fake items, isa ako sa mga gumawa noong time nayon. Naban account ko for selling health-related stuffs. I earned P120k.

2021, I focused on physical store business. Yes, nagtinda nalang ako ng sisig franchise. I burned all the money I earned from E-Com. Failed businesses. Ang masaklap e, negative pako. Nakapangutang pako sa mga kamag anak around P300k. Negative 300k pare.

2022-Early 2023, Namasukan akong Manager sa restaurant ng nanay ko to pay off debt, but 15k-20k/month isn't really enough lalo na may live-in partner ako since 2020. I also have a son. From my last 25k na ipon, I bought a coffee vendo machine (this is not f\*cking sponsored ah). This machine luckily bringing in 6-7k/month consistently. We're serving patients, visitors going to the hospital. The income from machine is the one paying debt pakonte konte.

Feb 2023 - I've decided to enroll a course to be a VA. Paid 7k.Studied for 2 months, while studying, I've delete my FB Account that's with me since 2009 (hardest part- it felt like I killed my other half) but I have to do it to be able to retrieve my ADS Account. If you're a Meta Advertiser, you know what I'm talking about.

May 2023 - I've started the jobhunt in OLJ. Like everyone else's doing, mass application. I'm always ended up in top 3-5 of the final list. Can't land a job. I said to my girlfriend, I need you to work. I can't handle our finances, I need help. She didn't hesitate. Lahat ng pwede applayan pinuntahan namin makapasok lang sya. Luckily she ended up getting hired after a week, earning P13k/month.

May 23, 2023 (Friday Evening) - I broke down as man. I'm looking at my girlfriend when we got home from her work, staring her and holding my tears to drop. I feel as a failure. I f\*cking failed. I said this to the Lord ""Ginagawa ko naman ang lahat bakit nyo ko pinapahirapan ng ganito"" ""Kayo na bahala saken"". I hold onto my tears but I'm dying inside. I surrendered everything to him.

May 24 2023 - Hinatid ko yung girlfriend ko sa work, early morning. Pauwi nako, I received an email. A job trial offer (15k guaranteed). The email is from a client who rejects me 2 days ago. She changed her mind, she said her guts tell her to pursue my application.

June 2023 - 7 days later, the agency burned their contract. I was offered $1800 for a Growth Director position.

Since then, I've got promoted twice. Received full 13th month pay from year '23 and '24. Sponsored Macbook worth P140k packaged with my promotion. Now, an all expense paid trip to Bohol at the most expensive hotel, 4D 3N. Together with my 2 Pioneering Pinoy VA. We'll be there on April 12.

Now, Debt paid off. We lived the way we lived from 25k paycheck even if we're receiving that kind of salary, 70-80% is savings. Ps. Malayo na yung sweldo ko ngayon sa unang job offer.

Trust me brothers and sisters, most 6-D earner VAs don't wanna be seen. I'm one of those. But this times getting messy.

This is a lesson of faith, sacrifice, loyalty, upscaling and consistently providing results.

Make yourself too important to the business. Be seen with results. Dapat magaling ka sa planning to execution then assessment, then reporting the results regardless, then improve, then repeat pare. Di yung magaling ka lang sa p\*tnginang CV/resume/portfolio mo, ampaw ka naman sa execution.

1st year learn everything you can  
2nd year upskill  
3rd year onwards ask yourself if kaya mo naba mag scale, dagdag client o dagdag negosyo.

I can guarantee on your 3rd year with the same skill, you won't hesitate to charge 6 digits to a single client.

Read this: Be hungry to learn. Compile your skills and experience. Don't chase the money, tame it .PROVIDE VALUE VALUE VALUE. Money will follow. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING MY FRIEND. THANK ME LATER.

1j8a1po,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/1j8a1po/an_open_letter_to_canadians_from_an_american_who/,An Open Letter to Canadians from an American Who Cares,"Dear Northerly Neighbor,

I wanted to reach out, not as a politician or a policymaker, but as an American who cares deeply about the friendship between our two countries. The United States and Canada share the longest undefended border in the world, a history of standing together in times of war and peace, and an alliance built on mutual respect. But beyond treaties and trade agreements, there‚Äôs something more important‚Äîour people.

For me, Canada isn‚Äôt just a neighboring country. It‚Äôs personal.

I have family in Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, and now Lethbridge. I‚Äôve visited before, walked your cities, shared meals with loved ones, and felt the kindness that so many Canadians are known for. And then, not too long ago, I met someone who made Canada even more important to me.

We met, of all places, on Reddit. What started as casual conversation turned into something real, something that changed my life. At first, Canada was just where she lived. But as I spent more time there, meeting the people she loves and becoming part of her world, it became something much more.

Canada became late-night conversations on the couch. It became laughter around the dinner table, quiet moments of understanding, and a growing sense of home in a place I never expected to find it. Through her, I built new relationships, learned new traditions, and saw a country not just as a visitor, but as someone who belonged.

I didn‚Äôt just fall in love with her‚ÄîI fell in love with the family I‚Äôve built there. Her son, who‚Äôs smart, thoughtful, and constantly teaching me new things. Her family, who welcomed me with open arms, never making me feel like an outsider. I‚Äôve had conversations that made me feel heard in ways I didn‚Äôt expect, and I‚Äôve shared meals that made me feel like I truly belonged.

I remember stepping off the plane and feeling a different kind of cold‚Äîsharp, crisp, and clean in a way that made the air feel lighter. I remember seeing my first truly blue lake in Alberta, water so vibrant it felt unreal. I remember lacing up skates on Lake Louise, wobbling at first, then finding my balance as the ice stretched endlessly in every direction. I remember sitting in a warm little restaurant in Montreal, digging into a plate of poutine at La Banquise, and finally understanding why Canadians talk about it with such pride.

And it‚Äôs the small things, too. The way people hold doors open, the way ""sorry"" is a reflex, the way even a gas station coffee stop can turn into a friendly chat. I‚Äôve lost track of how many Timbits I‚Äôve eaten, but I still carry a little Timbit keychain on my backpack, a reminder of simple joys and shared moments. I‚Äôve become a hockey fan‚Äînot just watching the games, but understanding why they matter. There‚Äôs an energy, a passion, a love for the game that‚Äôs infectious. It‚Äôs the way we talk about football here.

When I visit, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in a foreign country. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm with strangers. I feel at home.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs been frustrating to see the growing tensions between our governments. I live just outside Washington, D.C., so I‚Äôve been exposed to politics my entire life. I know how easily decisions are made without fully considering the people they impact. But I also know that political divides don‚Äôt define the relationships between people. And I refuse to let the actions of a few overshadow the connections I‚Äôve built‚Äîthe friendships, the family, and the deep appreciation I‚Äôve come to have for this country.

So, I‚Äôve done what I can. I‚Äôve written to my Congressman, my Senators, and even the White House, reminding them that Canada isn‚Äôt just another country on a list of foreign policy concerns. It‚Äôs our closest friend, our most trusted ally, and a place that means the world to many Americans‚Äîmyself included. I don‚Äôt know if my letters will change anything, but I know that staying silent isn‚Äôt an option.

And I hope you don‚Äôt stay silent either. If you‚Äôre frustrated with the way things feel right now, remind your friends and family that Americans, on the whole, love Canada. Because I‚Äôve been doing the same here‚Äîtelling people that Canadians are more than just our neighbors, they‚Äôre part of our lives.

I am proud to be American. But I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better neighbor.

We are not so different. In fact, we have more in common than the headlines would ever suggest. And I truly believe that if we keep reminding each other of that, if we keep speaking up, we can make things better.

To Canada, to the people who have welcomed me, to the family I have found there, and to the woman I love‚Äîthank you.

With respect and appreciation,,

fast forward a few days, im at work (i work retail) and all of a sudden i get super dizzy, to the point where standing was tough. my boss lets me go home early, i eat chipotle and it basically completely subsides. i chalked it up to the fact that i hadn‚Äôt eaten yet and the amoxicillin was too strong. eventually, i finished out my antibiotics and the fullness and tinnitus was still there so i went to an ENT on 2/27. i took a hearing test and i had moderate hearing loss in low frequencies in my left ear (i don‚Äôt know the scientific name for the test or graphs). he explains it‚Äôs an inner ear issue and that there‚Äôs three options. 

1. viral infection causing labyrinthitis (most likely)
2. m√©ni√®re‚Äôs (less likely)
3. lesions or mass on brain (very small chance)

he started me on 20mg of Prednisone, taking 3 daily for 7 days, 2 daily for 3 days, 1 daily for 2 days, and 1/2 for 2 days. today was my last day of taking 1 a day, i finish the bottle this wednesday. i had to cut out caffeine (which i was a daily drinker) and alcohol (im a college student, a couple times a week) and low salt (pretty hard). after picking up my prescription, i got an odd sense of dizziness while walking home which progressed to the point where i couldn‚Äôt walk in a straight line and felt awful. i eventually made it home and layed down on the phone with my father (who suffered from BBPV back in the 90s for 2 weeks and then never again) and he assured me it‚Äôll pass. i went to bed for four hours and it was gone when i awoke. the two days following all i had was tinnitus and slight fullness, no vertigo. this was like this for a few days, and then i woke up half asleep around 7-8 A.M. one day with a spinning sensation and i was able to fall back asleep and it was gone. tinnitus was loud while im in class but there was no vertigo or dizziness associated with it until later on that day after looking at my computer while working on music. but that subsided quickly and i went to bed. one day that week right before my follow up appointment with the ENT, i woke up with no dizziness and a small sense of tinnitus but throughout the day i got dizzier and dizzier but manageable enough to hang out in the apartment and not have to sleep it off. it eventually subsided and i was completely okay. 

went back to the ENT for a hearing test, hearing had went from moderate to mild which was a sign that the Prednisone was working. The PA told me to keep going on the steroid and come back monday (today) for another hearing test. i was really pumped, the Prednisone had been making me really anxious and irrationally angry all the time, i‚Äôm an anxious person as is so i was constantly looking on forums and blogs to assure myself i didn‚Äôt have m√©ni√®re‚Äôs. i worked all day saturday with low tinnitus and then i walked a good deal to my friends after work and noticed dizziness when i got there. we went out to dinner for his birthday and i was dizzy and woozy but not to the point where i couldn‚Äôt walk properly or felt like throwing up, just a heavy head and had to move slowly. it went away halfway through dinner and i was fine. i worked yesterday and my tinnitus was fine too, also didn‚Äôt get dizzy. fast forward to today, i woke up feeling fine with no dizziness. i go to my ENT appointment, and i was seeing the real deal inner ear specialist today. i scored lower on my hearing test than the previous one, and he told me i have m√©ni√®re‚Äôs. he gave me the steroid injection and now im home. 

i‚Äôm just wondering where to go from here? i‚Äôm young and i know i have to take it seriously but will i ever be able to do things again? i‚Äôm becoming content with drinking decaf coffee, but 
am i never gonna be able to eat at restaurants again? am i never gonna be able to have a drink again? im also a musician, i hope to perform someday, will i even be able to do that? this all came out of nowhere and i still feel like im in shock. ive never had hearing issues or balance issues before. i do vape/smoke cigarettes, ive been trying to cut back but ya know. i‚Äôm just overall an anxious person and maybe its the Prednisone making me feel depressed and irrational but im not sure what to do or how to feel. thanks.

1j8a0y1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j8a0y1/cold_hands_through_grey_walls/,Cold Hands Through Grey Walls,"I remember the first time I played Majora's Mask on the N64. I was thirteen, living in my parents' suburban home with its creaky floorboards and that one hallway that was always too dark, no matter how many lamps Mom put there. It was the kind of house that made silence feel like it had weight.

Dad had bought me the game for my birthday after months of begging. I'd tear through my homework just to squeeze in an hour before dinner.

The game unsettled me from the start‚Äînot just because of the moon's malevolent grin or the relentless ticking clock that counted down to doomsday. It was something deeper. The game felt *wrong* in a way my thirteen-year-old brain couldn't articulate. Like finding an old home video and realizing, for the first time, that the person holding the camera is dead.

Despite all that, there was one strange comfort: at least Dead Hand wasn't in Majora's Mask. That pale, twisted creature from Ocarina of Time with its bloodstained face and those horrible arms emerging from the ground‚Äîit had terrified me so deeply that I'd turned off the game the moment I encountered it in the Bottom of the Well. I never finished Ocarina. Never wanted to see the 3DS remake either. Just seeing screenshots of that thing online would bring back the nightmares.

But Majora's Mask, for all its eeriness, at least felt like safer territory. No Dead Hand. Just a relentless timer and a sense of impending doom.

My friends never got it. ""It's just a Zelda game,"" they'd say with eye rolls. But they hadn't felt the way the game seemed to breathe when you weren't looking. The way it seemed to be waiting.

Years passed. I went to college, got a job at a marketing firm, and developed insomnia that settled into my bones like a permanent houseguest. When Nintendo announced the 3DS remake, I pre-ordered it immediately, desperate to reconnect with the strange dread that had colored my childhood.

But it wasn't the same. Something felt different. Not just the enhanced graphics or the tweaked boss fights. There was a sterility to it, as if Nintendo had taken sandpaper to the original's jagged edges. The darkness had been sanitized, made palatable. I completed it during a weekend alone in my apartment, enjoyed it well enough, and moved on.

Then came the breakup. Sarah and I had been together for three years. We'd talked about rings, about houses, about names for children we'd never have. When she left, taking half our friends and leaving me with an apartment full of furniture that suddenly belonged to strangers, I found myself diving into nostalgia headfirst.

I wasn't using a cartridge this time. I had downloaded an emulator during a particularly dark 3 AM, telling myself it was nostalgia, that I wanted to relive the experience. But if I'm honest‚Äîand isn't honesty the point when you're recording something no one else will ever see?‚Äîthat's not why I started digging.

I had stumbled across a forum thread about the **test maps** in *Majora's Mask 3D*‚Äîunused development spaces hidden in the code. In the original N64 version, the test rooms for Stone Tower Temple were just unfinished areas with placeholder textures. Nothing remarkable. But in the 3DS remake, they were **different**.

The layout was identical to the actual dungeon rooms, but stripped of textures. Just a featureless **grey** void.

No enemies. No music. No ambient sound. Just silent, empty space.

I had to see them for myself. It wasn't curiosity‚Äîit was compulsion.

# THE DESCENT

Emulators allow you to access debug menus and warp to hidden areas that ordinary players would never see. It took me three nights of tinkering‚Äîthree nights of instant ramen and energy drinks, of calling in ""sick"" to work and ignoring texts‚Äîbefore I found myself standing in one of the Grey Rooms.

At first, I thought I'd made a mistake‚Äîlike I'd loaded an unfinished prototype or corrupted my ROM. The world around me was **flat**. Smooth, grey walls stretched endlessly in all directions, like being trapped inside a blank sheet of paper. The minimap still worked in the corner of my screen, showing doors and pathways that should have been there, but without textures, everything blurred together into a suffocating uniformity. No landmarks. No reference points. Just grey.

I pressed the button to summon Tatl, Link's fairy companion. Her glow flickered faintly, barely lighting the space around me. It should have been reassuring to see something familiar, a splash of color in this monochrome prison, but it only made the situation worse.

Because the walls weren't **smooth**.

Up close, they had texture‚Äîsomething shifted beneath the surface, like patterns you see when you press your palms against your closed eyelids. It wasn't an animation. More like **movement**, slow and writhing, as if something was struggling to break through from another dimension. As if the wall itself was breathing.

""It's just a graphical bug,"" I whispered to my empty apartment. ""Just a rendering issue.""

Still, nothing happened. No enemies spawned. No puzzles presented themselves. Just me and Link, standing in an impossible space.

I was about to quit, to chalk it up as another internet myth, when something caught my eye. A glint of something that didn't belong.

A green rupee, sitting in the corner where two grey walls met.

It shouldn't have been there. These test rooms weren't supposed to have any items or collectibles. Just empty space for developers to test mechanics.

I guided Link over to it. When he touched it, the rupee disappeared with the familiar chime, the count increasing by one. Normal. Expected. But what wasn't expected was what appeared behind where the rupee had been.

A small indent in the wall. Barely noticeable unless you were looking for it.

I positioned Link against it and pressed forward. He didn't move. But when I approached it from an angle, something strange happened. The camera clipped through the wall for a split second, revealing... another grey space beyond. A hidden area.

That's when my obsession truly began.

For the next seventy-two hours, I barely ate or slept. I called in sick to work three days in a row, ignoring my boss's increasingly concerned voicemails. I scoured every inch of those Grey Rooms, pressing against walls, looking for collision detection failures, trying to clip through boundaries that shouldn't have existed.

On the third night, I found it‚Äîan arrow quiver sitting impossibly in the middle of a featureless room. When Link collected it, the floor beneath it seemed to ripple, like the surface of water. I directed him to that spot and made him play the Song of Soaring.

The screen went black.

When it faded back in, Link was in a new Grey Room. But this one had something the others didn't.

It had a door.

# THE SOUND

It started with a noise. Something faint, just on the edge of hearing.

A slow, dragging sound.

The longer I stayed in the Grey Rooms, the more I felt an overwhelm**ing presence**. Not like being watched‚Äîlike being *absorbed*. A certainty that I wasn't alone, that something was pressing against the membrane separating their reality from mine.

Then, I heard it.

A **wet, slithering noise**. Like someone dragging a soaked carpet across concrete.

I stopped moving Link.

Listened.

Nothing.

I took another step.

**Thick. Dragging.**

My breath caught in my throat. My heart hammered against my ribs. I recognized that sound from countless nightmares.

**Wallmaster.**

The entity that lurks above you in *Majora's Mask*, waiting to drop and pull you back to the start of the dungeon. Those giant, disembodied hands that would fall from the ceiling without warning, grabbing Link and dragging him away.

But there were **no enemies** in the Grey Rooms. The developers had left them empty. That was the whole point.

I tilted the camera **up**, my finger trembling on the control stick.

Nothing visible. Just more grey stretching to infinity.

And then, just as I was about to look away, it happened. A massive shadow fell over Link, and before I could react, the Wallmaster dropped. The screen went dark as it grabbed him, and in that fraction of a second before the screen faded completely, I swear I saw something else. Behind the Wallmaster‚Äîa silhouette. Thin, misshapen, with elongated arms and that blood-smeared face from the Bottom of the Well. Dead Hand.

But that was impossible. Dead Hand wasn't in Majora's Mask. It was from Ocarina of Time.

When the screen faded back in, Link was standing in the exact same spot. The Grey Room hadn't changed. Nothing had reset. But something had changed the rules.

I convinced myself it was a glitch‚Äîa leftover audio cue triggered by accident. Some remnant of code that shouldn't have been there.

Then I attempted to exit fullscreen, suddenly desperate to see my desktop, my email, anything from the real world.

The emulator **froze**.

For a full second, everything on my screen stuttered like a heart attack. Then the game **minimized itself**. I didn't touch anything. My hands were hovering above the keyboard.

I stared at my desktop‚Äîa photo of Sarah and me in better times‚Äîheart racing.

Then I heard the noise again.

**Not from the game.**

From my **computer**.

The first time, I barely registered it. Like a book sliding an inch off a shelf. When I looked around, everything in my apartment was exactly as I had left it.

Later, at work, I heard it again. Just the softest scrape, like a chair moving slightly. A sound so small that, by the time I processed it, it had already stopped.

It happened while I was brushing my teeth that night. The whisper of movement. The faintest suggestion of something shifting in the corner of my vision.

By the time I made the connection, it was too late.

# THE NOISE FOLLOWED ME

I shut the emulator down. Force-quit it from Task Manager. No unfamiliar processes were running. Nothing unusual at all. My CPU usage was normal. Memory consumption, normal. Everything looked fine.

But it wasn't fine.

I unplugged my headphones, thinking maybe they were shorting out.

The noise was **still there**‚Äîfaint, distant. Like something **inside my computer was moving**. Shifting. Searching.

""Get it together, man,"" I muttered, running my hands through greasy hair. ""You're sleep-deprived. You're still messed up about Sarah. This isn't real.""

Days passed. I tried to ignore it. I went to work. I made myself shower. I even called my mom, pretending everything was fine when she asked if I'd been eating properly.

Then, while watching a YouTube video during my lunch break‚Äîsome mindless countdown show about video game Easter eggs‚ÄîI heard it again.

*Slithering.*

My coworker glanced over. ""You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

I forced a smile. ""Just remembered I forgot to send an email.""

Back at home, I muted my speakers. The noise continued.

I powered down my PC completely.

It **did not stop immediately**.

It faded slowly, like something retreating reluctantly into darkness. Like something that didn't want to go.

I slept on the couch that night, as far from my computer as my one-bedroom apartment would allow.

# THE DEAD HAND

It started in the game first. After returning to the normal areas of Majora's Mask, things weren't right anymore. I was in Clock Town plaza, surrounded by NPCs going about their routines, when a townswoman reached up to adjust her hat. Her arm elongated unnaturally for a fraction of a second, skin bleaching white, joints bending at impossible angles. It resembled the arms from the Bottom of the Well in Ocarina of Time‚ÄîDead Hand's limbs, reaching up from the ground to paralyze you before the main body lurched forward with that blood-smeared face.

The glitch, if that's what it was, lasted maybe half a frame. So brief I convinced myself I'd imagined it.

Until it happened again. And again. A guard waving. A shopkeeper reaching for rupees. A Goron extending his arm for a handshake. Each time, just for a microsecond, their limbs would transform into something pale, wrong, and familiar.

Then it followed me out.

Two days after my marathon session in the Grey Rooms, I was sitting in a quarterly strategy meeting at Merrick & Davis Financial, trying to focus despite not having slept in nearly 72 hours. VP Jenkins was droning on about Q4 projections when Lauren from Accounting reached across the conference table for the water pitcher.

Her arm seemed to stretch, joints bending slightly backward, skin losing pigment for just a heartbeat. Then normal again. Just a tired coworker in a fluorescent-lit conference room.

No one else reacted. No one gasped or screamed. Just me, suddenly bolt upright in my chair, heart hammering.

""Richards? Thoughts on the Henderson account?"" Jenkins asked, and fifteen pairs of eyes turned to look at me.

I mumbled something about needing to review the numbers and promised to follow up by email. Jenkins frowned‚Äîhe hates when people aren't prepared‚Äîbut moved on. Another black mark on my record, no doubt.

In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face and stared at my reflection. The irony wasn't lost on me‚ÄîI have psoriasis, patches of dry, flaky skin that sometimes make people stare a second too long. Once, in my twenties, some asshole at the gym had called my arm ""zombie skin."" How would I feel if someone looked at me the way I'd just looked at Lauren?

It happened again at the office kitchen. Dan from IT reached for the coffee pot, and for a fraction of a second‚Äîso quick I would have missed it if I'd blinked‚Äîhis arm wasn't right. Elongated. Pale. Wrong.

""You look like hell, man,"" he said, pouring coffee with a perfectly normal hand. ""Big project?""

""Deadline stress,"" I mumbled, avoiding his eyes. If I started acting too weird at work, HR would notice. People already whispered about my divorce, about how I'd been ""different"" since Sarah left. One more incident and I could find myself on ""stress leave""‚Äîcorporate code for ""we're easing you out.""

And then what? My mortgage doesn't pay itself. The alimony doesn't stop because I'm seeing things.

""It's sleep deprivation with possible hypnagogic hallucinations,"" my doctor told me the next day during my lunch break. ""Your brain is filling in gaps, pulling images from your subconscious."" He prescribed sleeping pills that I never filled. I knew better than to close my eyes for too long.

""Have you been playing those video games again?"" he asked as I was leaving. ""The ones with the monsters?""

I froze at the door. ""How did you‚Äî""

""Your ex-wife mentioned it during your couples counseling last year."" He smiled reassuringly. ""Said it was a source of tension‚Äîyou escaping into childhood nostalgia instead of addressing adult problems. The mind often incorporates elements from our media consumption into our perceptions when we're exhausted or stressed.""

As he reached for his prescription pad, his sleeve rode up. For a microsecond‚Äîso brief I almost convinced myself I imagined it‚Äîsomething was wrong with his wrist. The skin too white, too bloodless, the joint bending at a nauseating angle.

Then normal again. Just a concerned doctor with weathered hands.

# THE GREY ROOMS ARE WAITING

Later that night, I caught a glimpse of my own hand while washing dishes. The psoriasis patches seemed to spread before my eyes, whitening, elongating my fingers in the reflection of the soapy water. When I jerked my hand out, it was normal again. Just my familiar skin condition, nothing more.

I couldn't tell what was worse‚Äîthe possibility that I was hallucinating away my career and financial stability, or the possibility that I wasn't.

I barely made it through the next day. My coworkers' hands kept... changing. Jensen pointing at the whiteboard. Maria passing me a folder. Even our CEO stopping by to ""check in on the team,"" his handshake lingering a moment too long while his fingers seemed to stretch and pale against mine.

No one said anything. No one noticed. Just me, sweating through my dress shirt, wondering if I was losing my mind.

Last night, I woke up at 3:17 AM to find my bedroom door open.

A perfect rectangle of darkness.

I never opened it.

But in the darkness of the hallway beyond, I thought I saw something. Just for a moment. A pale white hand extending from the wall, joints wrong, fingers too long. Then nothing. Just shadows and mid-range furniture collecting dust from a life half-lived.

Then I noticed something else.

The wallpaper near my bedroom door.

At first, I thought it was just peeling slightly from the humidity. But as my eyes adjusted, I realized the texture was wrong.

It wasn't peeling.

It was shifting.

The surface moved, slow and writhing, just beneath the paper, like something struggling to push through. Like the walls in the Grey Rooms.

As I stood there, staring into the darkness of my hallway, I saw a shadow move against the wall. Not the shifting of tree branches outside my window, but something thin and misshapen, with elongated limbs that seemed to stretch impossibly before vanishing around the corner. A silhouette I recognized from childhood nightmares.

My boss's words from yesterday's performance review came back to me. He had reached for my personnel file, and for the briefest instant‚Äîif I'd blinked, I would have missed it‚Äîhis hand had looked wrong.

""You know,"" he had said, sleeve sliding back to reveal perfectly normal skin once more, ""sometimes we need to take a break when things get overwhelming. The company health plan covers mental health services.""

He couldn't have known what I'd been experiencing. It was just corporate-approved language for ""get your shit together or we'll have to let you go.""

Yet as I lie here in bed typing this, I keep glancing at my own hands on the keyboard. The psoriasis patches seem to be spreading, growing paler, taking on that familiar texture from the game. From the Grey Rooms.

And sometimes, between keystrokes, my fingers seem to elongate just a bit. Stretch just a little too far.

No one would believe me. I barely believe myself. My 401k is vested. I have a mortgage. I can't just quit because I'm seeing things.

But I know what's happening.

The Grey Rooms are expanding. They're finding the spaces between reality‚Äîthe cracks in the world where things don't quite fit together properly. And they're reaching through.

I'm going to leave this document here, in case someone finds it. In case someone else stumbles into those test maps and brings something back.

I've called in sick to work. Used up my last personal day. My boss sounded skeptical‚Äîarms probably normal as he held the phone, but I couldn't be sure. I can't be sure of anything anymore.

My bank account won't survive unemployment. My credit won't survive foreclosure. But my sanity won't survive going back to that office, watching hands stretch and pale and reach when no one else can see it.

I'm standing up now. Walking to my open bedroom door. That perfect rectangle of darkness.

And somewhere in that darkness, something is waiting. I can see its silhouette against the wall, thin and distorted, arms too long, body too still. Watching. Waiting. Patient.

It had already won.

My laptop's webcam light just flickered on.

I unplugged it months ago.

The Grey Rooms aren't confined to the game. They never were.

They're here. In my walls. In my apartment. In the spaces between what's real and what shouldn't be.

And now?

They're waiting.

Shoulder pain, pain side where gallbladder is and times where it feels like my gallbladder has actually swelled and it (gallbladder) felt like it was getting caught on my lower ribs when I sat in certain positions. 

I was diagnosed with adrenal fatigue in my mid 20‚Äôs when I gained like 60 lbs in less than 6 months. 

Now I‚Äôm looking back and wondering if this was when my gallbladder actually started failing because my health started deteriorating around this time and weight would.not.come.off.

I‚Äôm a caffeine addict with a full pot of espresso coffee every morning, preworkout after that and then more coffee afternoon. I‚Äôm exhausted all the time and need to keep up with everything and caffeine is all I have to keep my energy up. 

After your gallbladder surgery, did you have more energy? 

What did you take to supplement not having a gallbladder?

Were you better able to lose weight?

Right now, we think that the bad gallbladder is stressing my body and my body is making more cortisol so I am constantly in survival mode and I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted from it. The cortisol makes me stress eat to get some relief. It was weird because I didn‚Äôt have anything at the time to feel stressed about and suddenly I was in fight or flight mode, overwhelmed and stressed. Now I just think my body could be responding to a bad gallbladder.

My US 2 yrs ago didn‚Äôt see gallstones or anything wrong. I was supposed to have a HIDA scan after that but my son got sick so I had to cancel it and just got it rescheduled today for end of this month.

I have been going back and forth on if this is my gallbladder or something else. Because the pain was going away before but now it‚Äôs pretty much staying 24/7.

We have a high pain threshold that runs in our family so if I feel any pain then it must be something bad. My mom had two babies without any meds. I was induced and didn‚Äôt feel confident tractions to have my baby. Uncle lost his leg because he didn‚Äôt know anything was wrong so this worries me if I‚Äôm feeling pain.

I have been working hard to try to be healthy for my son because he needs me to be active and I‚Äôm hoping if the gallbladder does show bad and it‚Äôs removed then maybe I will feel better after removal?

Has anyone else had anything similar with the fatigue or anything else and did you get more energy after removal?

Did anyone else get brain fog too?

1j89vor,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/1j89vor/wanna_race/,Wanna race?,"""Wanna race?"" said me to a pickup-obsessed neighbour.  We played a ""get to town first"" game from our rural homes.  He drove a farm pickup, I rode a bicycle.  We kept score.  For years.  The prize?   Bragging rights and the winner gets a free dinner on every solstice and equinox, paid by loser.  

Local coffee shop got wind of the contest.  The staff tie-dyed some T-shirts, made a logo. Then the little bakery joined, made its own logo and offered prizes for guessing the winner of the week. 

Cue the Fear-Of-Missing-Out alarm.  Book store printed jigsaw puzzles; All answers tied to the friendly challenge made in jest. They followed up with maps of the town roads.  The new mystery was *Who are these people and where do they live?*  The village birthed hordes of Sherlock Holmes wannabees.  They hunted down the truck and entire convoys of bicycle riders followed the bike for miles, always hoping the driver or rider might just lead the way home.  Nope. 

Camera shop offered freebies to shutterbugs who publish photos of the action.  Bets were placed among the town locals and business owners, all trying to outdo the other.  Even the stone mason was willing to engrave a plaque in the village commons.  It got ridiculous.  People never before seen in public suddenly were hanging out and actually ... gasp ... talking to each other. 

Shoe store added a new twist with window advert ""Humans walked for 100,000 years"", complete with nice 1950's style watercolor illustrations of footprints to shoe brands. Things were hotting up.   All the little Mom & Pop businesses had a stake in this. They offered products and services to the fans who guessed the winner of the week. Team rivalries were born.  

Bribes were offered to the contestants. Candy shop put two see-through plastic tubes in the window, adding a handful of sweets  to the car column or bike column depending on who was spotted zipping along the cobblestoned Main Street first.  Clusters of spotters in nasty weather became swarms in good weather. 

Send in the route saboteurs.  Detour signs (""borrowed"" from other towns) sprang up overnight.  A few fixed races happened unbeknownst to Mr. Farmtruck or to me.  I am certain the two broken down cars and that tow truck were planted just to delay the neighbour.  I grinned that day, sailed right on by and waved.  Love my fans. 

Postscript:  Neighbour and me are old old old now, and it just dawned on me.  Where the f\*\*\* did all that money go.  The bets, the products, the services from every last business in that little village?  For me the goodwill, comraderie, social cohesion and memories of the ""Wanna Race"" jest are reward enough.

I can‚Äôt talk about this with my partner because it‚Äôs about his family and I don‚Äôt want him to get involved. Or make things awkward since they‚Äôre not toxic and don‚Äôt want things to sour, when things are good otherwise with his family. 

So, I‚Äôve been struggling with loneliness as a new mom and now 8 months post-partum. My (sister in-law f29) Macy is getting married. I‚Äôm not part of the bridal party since I came into my partner life 2 years ago, and she has been engaged for 3 and had already named her bridal party and obviously we didn‚Äôt know each other. I also just want to make it clear, I don‚Äôt expect or expected her have me or daughter (her niece) in the bridal party. She has added baby girl as something (not sure). Obviously I wasn‚Äôt, wish I completely understand. 

I just realized the maid of honour (sister in law 34) Krystal and Macy (bride) haven‚Äôt discussed the bachelorette party around me whatsoever. And it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm not invited. And I feel rejected. Again. 

I‚Äôm hurt obviously, but I also want to say I respect her choice for not inviting me and don‚Äôt have any expectations. I just thought I would have been at least invited to join the festivities. It‚Äôs hard because I thought we were on friendly enough terms for it to happen (wish it‚Äôs my fault for thinking that).  

I‚Äôm just sad because it made me realize how much more lonely I‚Äôve been feeling and it being more apparent that I no longer have friends to support me or talk to. My best friends ever since finding out I was pregnant saw me once at my baby shower. And has ghosted me since the birth of my baby. And it‚Äôs been painful. 

It‚Äôs hard for me to develop deep friendships because I never got to chance to develop one since I grew up with military parents and move around so much. I can talk to many people and be friendly, and people seem to enjoy speaking with me. But, as an adult it isn‚Äôt enough to start a friendship. 

People are like go to mom groups, in my area like each mom group I go to the moms are much older than I am (like 36-42) and don‚Äôt seem to want to connect other than about the group activity. 

I‚Äôve tried peanut and it‚Äôs mainly moms wanting to speak online only, which is hard for me as I prefer face to face friendships and I kinda want to go out (like for a nice dinner or coffee) with a friend maybe like once a month or every two months if that‚Äôs too much for them. Maybe talk once a week or every two weeks either via text or face time. It doesn‚Äôt have to be constant either. But, yeah it seems like I haven‚Äôt found someone who would simply want to do those things with me whether they have a kid or not. 

It hurts because I read stories on Reddit about awful friends and I‚Äôm not into wanting to make things complicated or causing drama for others. I know I‚Äôm a great friend to have, but I seem to be the last choice or not at all. Maybe I‚Äôm too boring. I just wanted at least a friend during this period of life. But, I guess it‚Äôs not in the cards for me at the moment. Will keep trying.

He seemed okay and didn't press it further. 

But I never stopped having a crush on him.

I've been friends with this guy (52M) for at least five years. We met at a work event and usually see each other twice a year because we live in different cities. He's a good guy, smart, charismatic, and respectful. We both work in research at university and are in the same research project. We're both married, so our relationship has always been strictly platonic. We don‚Äôt normally text or talk outside of those work-related events; we just catch up when we see each other. He would just send me happy birthday and congratulations when something important happens in my life. That's all.

That said, there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been bothering me. For years, every time I post a story on WhatsApp, he‚Äôs always the first person to view it‚Äîsometimes within seconds. It‚Äôs been happening consistently for a long time, and I‚Äôve started to wonder if it‚Äôs just a coincidence or something more. Out of curiosity, I started paying attention to when he was online and noticed that he‚Äôs often online/offline around the same times I am. One day I decided to post a status while he was online‚Äîand again, he viewed it within 2‚Äì3 seconds or even less. It was so quick, it almost felt like he was waiting for it. It struck me as odd, and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm reading too much into it.

He also seems to care a lot about me. He remembered my birthday after I casually mentioned it in a conversation many months ago and even texted me. (I don‚Äôt even remember most of my friends' birthdays unless Facebook reminds me!) The way he treats me and looks at me, it‚Äôs clear that he cares and thinks highly of me. He congratulates me on life milestones, recalls little things I‚Äôve said many years ago (even though we‚Äôre not that close), copies me sometimes, and often tries to find things in common.

The last time I saw him ‚Äî a little over a month ago ‚Äî he got super emotional and was even trembling with heart palpitations while sitting next to me at a work event. It felt like he was experiencing massive anxiety, and I could sense his vulnerability. That was the moment I started wondering if maybe he had other intentions with me. That‚Äôs also when I began paying closer attention to his behavior ‚Äî and then came the WhatsApp story views, which made things feel even stranger.

I also remembered another instance: he once left his own work meeting in the middle of the day just because I texted him at the last minute to grab a coffee (since I was visiting his city). At the time, I didn‚Äôt think much of it ‚Äî he‚Äôs a friend, after all ‚Äî but now, all these little things are adding up and making me rethink our entire dynamic.

I really value his friendship and I don‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions, but I also don‚Äôt know how to approach this. We work together, and I don‚Äôt want to create tension, but I also feel like I might need to set some boundaries or at least talk to him about it. I don‚Äôt have any intention of going beyond friendship, and I want to be clear about that ‚Äî but I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this without making things awkward or misinterpreting his actions.

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/IVSunxjty8)
^I was told people prefer linking the original post in updates. Hope that works.

I cannot believe that this is still a thing, much less one that people are interested in? Lucky me though, because the overwhelming support I received here convinced me to do some things I definitely wouldn't have done otherwise.

New things happened pretty quickly, but I held off on a new post because my last one was premature. Some things people predicted happened, other things did not.

Let's get this out of the way up front: The wedding is still on. The wedding will always still be on. This was never in doubt. I think a lot of commenters vastly overestimated my importance.

After talking with future sister-in-law, I did not hear anything from my brother, at least initially. I did eventually get a short text from her just saying that I shouldn't worry about the wedding anymore and they'll find someone else.

My mom was another story.

She called me repeatedly since I ignored her first few calls, and when I finally picked up, she was about two steps below screaming into the phone. About how I ""interfered in your brother's relationship and made things so much harder for them!"" and ""do you know how upset he is right now? It's time to put grudges aside and make amends!""

It was not an especially long conversation.

[I feel it is important to provide some context for my mom. I've seen some comments about she has clear favoritism for my brother. Strictly speaking, I'm not sure that's true. Over the years, she said or did some things to my brother that has, at several points, caused him to go no contact with her. Some of these I fully understood, others... created some questions. As a result, my mom tends to overcompensate when it comes to him because I think she's terrified of getting cut off again.]

I did a lot of self-reflection over the next few days about my relationships with my family members, and decided it was time to have a very honest conversation with my brother. I even booked a bonus therapy session specifically about preparing myself for this conversation.

I called him up and asked him point-blank if, knowing I will absolutely NOT be singing for him, he still wanted me to attend. He didn't answer for a bit, but eventually he said yes. 

I remembered a bunch of comments that said he may still try to pull something at his reception anyway using public pressure and announce me as the singer. While I personally didn't find that to be especially likely (my brother is a big planner/scheduler), I realized I no longer trusted him like I used to and said as much, and that I will only be attending the ceremony, not the reception.

He had a minor freak-out over this (""are you fucking kidding me?""), but then said it was whatever, and that I needed to come up with a concrete excuse for my absence so that ""bullshit doesn't overshadow everything"" (fine, whatever) and that I could no longer be his groomsman since that would leave an empty chair at the head table.

We hung up shortly after. We have not spoken again since. 

Something that hasn't come up before: we both have two other brothers (35, 26). Neither live in the same area as us (my younger brother lives on the other side of the country), and we don't talk especially frequently, so I don't know what, if anything, they had heard about the situation previously.

Well, because he kicked one of his brothers out of the wedding party, he decided to replace the other two as well because it wouldn't ""look right"" to have just 2 out of 3 of his brothers as groomsmen, so instead opted for 0 out of 3.

Eldest brother got kind of bratty about it (he included all three of his brothers in his wedding party when he got married and is mainly pissed about the non-reciprocation) but never asked for nor received the full story on our ""feud."" I don't especially enjoy talking to him, so if he wants to blame me for getting booted from the wedding party, that's fine.

My younger brother, on the other hand, made it his personal mission to extract every single detail possible from all parties. He called me up to get my side, and then decided he was going to join me in skipping the reception. He has decided to start brainstorming an excuse for the both of us. Honestly, I think he was looking for an excuse not to go anyway, he despises family functions.

At this point I am praying for no more updates. This is just fucking absurd. The wedding cannot come soon enough.

***

This is not related to the update, but instead to the comments/DMs I received.

I have tried my best to be civil with the many, many comments of ""Is that what Mason would want?"" or ""Have you tried therapy?"" We are now three posts deep on this nonsense. I'm not going to be trying so hard at civility anymore.

Also a reminder: singing was a HOBBY. I gave up a HOBBY.

I was not on the cusp of making it big. I did not throw away my dreams. This is 5 dudes screwing around in a basement on weekends and occasionally playing at a bar, fair, or coffee shop. For what it's worth, I still listen to music and even will pick up my bass again on occasion when I'm bored.

Therapy is not an undo button on grief and trauma. I am not the same person I was before he died, and I never will be again. Therapy is about accepting this and the new person I've become, not going back to the way things were. New OP! Model does not include singing!",64,1741641153.0,AITAH,8,0.98,False

He was very drink and says he didn‚Äôt know I was asleep, I believe him - I think he chose to not perceive me to get what he wanted. He has done all the ‚Äúright‚Äù things so far, taken accountability with family and friends, seeking repair with me, check ins and space, couples counselling, and we both started individual therapy. But I have a history of intimate partner assault and I am at such a loss. He moved out last week and the space is empty now, I have hated this room so much since it happened and I hate it even more now. I feel like I‚Äôm suffocating there and I just want to run away.

I found a place in an area I used to live in, it‚Äôs not perfect - the area is close to the highway, my room doesn‚Äôt have a closet, and I have to walk through one of their rooms to get to the bathroom (though they assured me it‚Äôs completely fine and they almost always have their door open).  But the place is close to my good friends, it‚Äôs so adorable, it has a garden, a clawfoot tub, I can bike to my favourite community garden and coffee shop, and it‚Äôs filled with art and cool sculptures. They have a three legged cat who is so sweet. They are both my age, 23, and one is a reiki healer and the other works at a therapist office - which feels like a cosmic connection because my whole life emphasises healing right now. They are both artists also. The room I would be moving into is beautiful as well and has a fireplace in it and big windows, dark wood floors. Lastly, the two girls are also queer and really cool, they also moved in after a traumatic event happened to them. Is it an omen?

It‚Äôs a year lease which would be a big commitment and I am a bit worried about the bathroom thing. I feel like if I move I have to fully seperate from my partner, or that it would at least force some separation since I am moving a couple cities over. I don‚Äôt even know if I would want him in that space.

Should I make the jump? My nervous system has been so disregulated so my feelings change every day. I‚Äôm worried I will feel just as depressed there, or that by settling down for a year im limiting my opportunities. But maybe I need to nest for a year, garden, find a job that suits me more, and be around my friends. I would have until may 1st to figure out a new job and fully move out. 

I need advice, thoughts, strength, spells - anything to help inform my decisions. I appreciate you all. ",3,1741640411.0,WitchesVsPatriarchy,5,0.8,False
1j8999m,https://www.reddit.com/r/icecoast/comments/1j8999m/hatley_pointe_first_season_round_up/,Hatley Pointe - First Season round up,"Now that Hatley Pointe's first season under new management is in the books, I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on the new mountain

I'm a lifelong skiier who grew up in Calgary in the 80s skiing the Canadian Rockies Alberta and BC, but now live in Atlanta.  I'm trying to teach my children to ski on the cheap (at least as much as that is possible considering we live in the South), so we made a day trip to Hatley Pointe in late January to check it out  in lieu of our usual local spot (Cataloochee) as a warm up for a week long trip to Snowshoe in February, and a trip to Breckinridge in March.  We arrived at around 8:45 am and skiied until 3:30 pm.  My 10 year old son and I have our own gear, but my wife and daughter needed to rent, so we got a full comparative experience.

Its clear the new management put a lot of money into this place and made a lot of improvements over the old Wolf Ridge, but they don't really know the nuts of bolts of running a ski mountain and it shows.  By contrast, Sugar and Cataloochee both have older facilities that are kind of run down and in desperate need of a cosmetic refresh, but their operations run efficiently and thus are better for actual skiing.

**Pros**:

* I was shocked and surprised at the massive amount of snow was on the mountain.
* views at the top of the chairlift were incredible
* the terrain that was open was more steep, fun, and challenging than I expected
* the drive from Atlanta was pretty easy (interstate the whole way except for the last
* Lodge renovation is beautiful and sets a new standard for NC ski areas,. The bathrooms were impeccably clean and the staff was constantly wiping down tables and sweeping up trash as people left their table to go back outside to ski. Cleanliness is clearly emphasized by the management.
* grab and go food at the lodge was reasonable price and quality (for a ski hill), although it wasn't anything spectacular
* beer selection and price at the interior lodge bar was reasonable (again, by ski hill standards)
* the outdoor ""Igloo"" bar next to the chairlift had super fast service and easy to access from the mountain
* I was genuinely shocked at the high level of skiing/boarding skill on the mountain (applies to blue and black runs only- the green runs at the bottom of the mountain were a total shit show)
* electronic lift ticket kiosk was fast and easy to use
* They limit the number of lift tickets sold each day, so the runs don't get insanely overcrowded.
* Lift tickets were comparative in price to other NC ski mountains
* DJ on the lodge deck got a legitimate dance party started. People were READY TO PARTY and were having a great time.

**Cons:**

* The online ticketing system is hot garbage - Their system does not allow you to put all of your purchases (rentals, lift tickets, lesson, etc)  in an online shopping cart and checking out at one time.  Buying lifts ticket online for two adults, two children, and renting skis for one adult and one child required three separate credit transactions, and I had to reenter all of my personal information each time. .
* Ski Rental pick up was an absolute nightmare -  Even with a prepaid equipment reservation, it took my wife and daughter almost 90 minutes to get their gear and get on the mountain to actually ski. The line was insanely long, the techs didn't seem to know how to get the gear adjusted and set up quickly, and its super dark in there.  Seriously,  the rental area in in the bottom of the lodge, has no windows,  the walls are all painted black, and the lighting in there is so dim its like renting skis in the Bruce Wayne's batcave. The batcave vibe was further enhanced by the upscale ""Aspen in the Appalachians"" lodge situation upstairs.
* Horribly Inadequate Signage - The directional signage is basically non-existent and what little there is is really, really terrible , both in the lodge and on the mountain.  When asking an employee where to find the  equipment rental area, I was literally  told ""go through those unmarked double doors by the ticket kiosk. The ones with no sign"".    ON the mountain, multiple trail signs here buried in the snow, so I had to look down to see them.
* Coffee Stand in the lodge was closed all day for no apparent reason despite being extremely cold outside and the mountain selling out of lift tickets for the day.
* Trail Map was extremely deceptive, almost to the point of fraud - The trail map showed multiple chairlifts as well as several blue and black runs at the top of the mountain that were marked as ""open"".  When we showed up, we learned there is only one operational chairlift, and many of the more advanced included on the map are just on there to show what planned for a ""future expansion"".
* Snow grooming was absolutely terrible - They clearly make a lot of snow, but they have no clue what to do with it once its on the mountain.  there were depressions and whales of snow all over the runs for no apparent reason.  This wasn't a problem for me because I'm a great skiier, but I saw lots of novices wipe out because of the poor and inconsistent grooming.
* BECAUSE HERE IS ONLY ONE QUAD CHAIRLIFT, SO THE LIFT LINE IS ABSURDLY LONG. To make matters worst, they had ZERO staff directing traffic to make sure they were loading 4 people on each chair to maximize the lift capacity.
* Lodge Bar was absurdly understaffed for the crowd that was there
* WHY IS THERE NO BEER STAND AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN? This seems like a no brainer
* They close 100% the runs at the end of the ""day"" skiing session for more than an hour to groom the mountain before reopening for night skiing, which is total horse shit. If I'm coming up to ski, I want to maximize my time and roll straight into night skiing without interruption
* Merch Stand - lots of overpriced trendy clothing, but had no skiing essentials like chapstick, sunscreen, or hand warmers.
* Guest services desk had an hour wait just to talk to someone if you had a question or concern
* I heard from the Ski Patrol they have to pay for their own ski passes. WTF?

All in all, we had a super fun day and I think this place \*could\* be totally awesome if they make some changes and dial things in, but only time will tell.   What was your experience at Hatley Pointe this year?",5,1741640355.0,icecoast,0,1.0,False

1j897b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1j897b9/succeedish_as_an_infp/,Succeed-ish as an INFP!,"I‚Äôm a male INFP, and a few years ago, I became **obsessed** with the Myers-Briggs system. It gave me so much clarity and a lens to reevaluate my life‚Äîespecially when it came to friendships, family relationships, and social anxiety.

One of the most important things I‚Äôve learned: INFPs (and some other NF types) value the **emotional quality** of interactions over the actual **content** of what happened. Most types focus on *what* they did‚Äî*""We went to a movie, grabbed coffee, took a walk""*‚Äîand categorize it as a good experience simply because it was a ""friendship-like"" activity.

But INFPs? We judge an experience as good or bad based on how **authentic** and **genuine** it *felt.* This is why we can leave a coffee date feeling strangely empty if the conversation was just surface-level life updates. And honestly, that kind of disconnect can cause a lot of social anxiety‚Äîespecially when others act like it was a great interaction while you feel completely hollow inside.

Anyway, I consider myself **insanely lucky** to be married to an ENFJ. Hallelujah. She reads me like a book, gives me space when I need it, and coaxes me out of my shell when I need that too. She‚Äôs also highly intuitive. We have two kids (who are awesome), but as a parent, I deal with **hypersensitivity** almost daily, and‚Äîlet‚Äôs be real‚Äîsome days I‚Äôm just white-knuckling my way through.

But here‚Äôs the biggest reason I wanted to post: **money and finances.**

INFPs are *notorious* for struggling with income. We tend to bounce from passion to passion, prioritizing emotional fulfillment over financial practicality. But after having kids, I realized that one of the **most loving things** I could do was achieve financial abundance‚Äîfor them.

So, I became a realtor in a high-end housing market. I‚Äôm making good money‚Äînot quite at the level I want for the future yet‚Äîbut I hit $200K in my second year.

Along the way, I‚Äôve been keeping a journal I‚Äôve dubbed **""Succeeding as an INFP.""** I write down my biggest strengths *and* weaknesses‚Äîbecause, let‚Äôs be honest, they‚Äôre often the same thing. For example, my ability to **read people and communicate deeply** is a *huge* asset in real estate. But that same sensitivity can be a burden when I have to ignore someone's feelings for the sake of the transaction (which does not come naturally to me). That said, I *have* learned how to use my emotional intelligence to de-escalate tough situations‚Äîso, progress!

Journaling has also helped me develop my weaker cognitive functions‚Äîespecially focusing on **smaller, ST (Sensing-Thinking) details** that I used to overlook.

Long story short: **good income IS possible for INFPs.** If anyone has questions, I‚Äôd love to answer questions.",3,1741640219.0,infp,0,0.8,False
1j896xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1j896xe/another_love/,Another love.,"About ten years ago, I met a girl while working on an island. I won‚Äôt go into too many details, but somehow, things just clicked, and we ended up together. We were a couple for about nine months, but life started getting in the way‚Äîher studies, my father‚Äôs illness‚Ä¶ In the end, he passed away two months after we broke up.

The breakup came out of nowhere, at least for me. It was right after we had an amazing five-day stretch together‚Äîgoing out, staying up late, just enjoying each other‚Äôs company. And then, suddenly, it was over. She was the one who ended it.

Since that day, not a single 24-hour period has passed where I haven‚Äôt thought about her. At first, I missed her in a romantic way, but as time went on, I realized it was more than that. I missed having her in my life, even just as a friend‚Äîsomeone I could call up for a coffee or a quick chat.

About five years after we split, I saw her again on that same island. At the time, I was already in a relationship with the woman who is now my wife, and she was seeing someone too. But she told me‚Äîstraight up‚Äîthat if neither of us had been with anyone, she could have easily been with me again. That stuck with me.

Now, I‚Äôve been with my wife for about six years, and we have a baby girl. And yet, my thoughts about this girl from the past never really went away. I‚Äôve made peace with the fact that they probably never will, and honestly, I don‚Äôt think I want them to. Those memories, that time in my life, it was one of the best periods I‚Äôve ever had. Why would I want to erase that?

At one point, I went to a psychologist, and through our conversations, I realized something: my father‚Äôs death and that breakup got tangled up in my mind. The grief from losing him mixed with the sadness of losing her. So now, whenever I think of him, I think of her. And whenever I think of her, I think of him. Maybe that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt fully move on.

I didn‚Äôt continue therapy after that. I had to leave for work again, and life just kept moving. But those feelings? They never really left.

And yet, I feel ashamed for these thoughts, like they‚Äôre keeping me from being fully present with my wife and child. I don‚Äôt want to forget‚ÄîI don‚Äôt think I ever could‚Äîbut I do wish I could find a way to live with them without feeling like they take something away from the life I have now.",2,1741640191.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False
1j895gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/EasyVegan/comments/1j895gv/is_your_coffee_vegan_surprising_additives_to/,Is Your Coffee Vegan? Surprising Additives To Watch Out For,"Hidden Ingredients: Are You Sure Your Coffee is Truly Vegan?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a coffee lover who follows a vegan lifestyle, you might think that your morning brew is safe from animal products. However, there are surprising additives hidden in many coffee brands and coffeehouse drinks that can make your cup of joe non-vegan. Let‚Äôs dive into some potential hidden ingredients that may not sit well with your dietary choices.

When you think of coffee, you picture the beans and the water you use to brew it. However, many products, from flavored coffees to certain creamers, can contain animal-derived ingredients. Awareness of these ingredients helps ensure that your coffee remains genuinely vegan. Here‚Äôs a list of common additives to watch for:

- **Milk and Cream:** The most obvious culprits, milk and cream, can sneak into your coffee in various forms, from lattes to whipped cream toppings. Always opt for plant-based milk alternatives to keep it vegan.
- **Honey:** Sometimes added to coffee blends as a sweetener, honey is produced by bees and is not vegan-friendly. Look for alternatives like agave syrup or maple syrup.
- **Gelatin:** This is often found in some flavored coffee creamers and can be used as a stabilizer. Gelatin is derived from animal collagen, making it unsuitable for vegans.
- **Dairy-derivative Flavorings:** Some flavored coffees may include dairy-based flavorings or additives. Always read the ingredient list to ensure there are no hidden milk products.
- **Carmine:** Used for coloring in some coffee beverages, carmine is made from crushed insects. Ensure your coffee is free from this surprising ingredient.
- **Casein:** A milk protein sometimes found in creamers, casein is not vegan, so it's crucial to choose non-dairy options.
- **Butter Flavored Extract:** Certain flavored coffees might contain butter flavoring, and you guessed it‚Äîthis ingredient isn't vegan. Check labels or choose plain flavors to avoid it.

Aside from the drinks and creamers, what about the coffee beans themselves? While most plain coffee beans are naturally vegan, a few brands use animal-based processes during production. Some brands may use animal fertilizers or even incorporate animal by-products in flavoring. To ensure you're consuming vegan-friendly coffee, always verify the brand‚Äôs sourcing methods and ingredients.

When visiting coffee shops, the potential for hidden non-vegan ingredients increases. Many cafes offer specialty drinks, which might contain unexpected items. Here's how to stay safe:

- Ask about the milk alternatives they provide, such as almond, soy, or oat milk.
- Inquire about sweeteners and avoid honey; opt for sugar, agave, or stevia instead.
- Request a list of ingredients for any flavored drinks, especially those with whipped cream or syrups.

Reading labels becomes crucial, especially with pre-packaged coffee products or flavored blends. Companies frequently change their formulas, so what once was vegan may now contain animal products.

For those who love a rich, creamy coffee experience, there are plenty of plant-based creamers available. These options can provide the flavor and texture you want without compromising your dietary principles. Look for brands that specifically label their products as vegan to simplify your shopping experience.

Additionally, consider making your coffee at home. This way, you control every ingredient. Explore spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg for flavor without the need for creamers. You can turn a simple cup of black coffee into a delicious, vegan-friendly treat with just a few tweaks.

Being vigilant about your coffee choices ensures that you can enjoy your favorite beverage without straying from your vegan commitments. By knowing what to avoid and choosing wisely, you can confidently say that your coffee is indeed vegan. So the next time you sip that delightful cup of coffee, you‚Äôll know exactly what‚Äôs inside!

The Impact of Dairy Alternatives on Coffee Taste and Texture
------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a coffee lover, you might have noticed a rising trend in the use of dairy alternatives. Whether you are lactose intolerant, following a vegan lifestyle, or simply seeking new flavors, these options have transformed the coffee experience. However, it's essential to understand how these alternatives can alter the taste and texture of your cup. Let's dive into the different dairy substitutes available and their impact on your beloved brew.

### Popular Dairy Alternatives

- **Almond Milk:** Known for its slightly nutty flavor, almond milk adds a mild sweetness to coffee. Its thinner consistency can make beverages feel less creamy, which may not suit everyone‚Äôs palate.
- **Oat Milk:** This favorite among coffee enthusiasts is prized for its creamy texture. It froths well, making it an ideal choice for lattes and cappuccinos while offering a subtly sweet and rich taste.
- **Coconut Milk:** With a tropical twist, coconut milk has a distinct flavor that can enhance or overpower your coffee. It typically produces a light, creamy foam but can be quite rich, so it may not be for every coffee drinker.
- **Soy Milk:** A widely available substitute, soy milk has a creamy texture and neutral flavor, allowing it to blend well with various coffee profiles. However, some brands may leave a slight aftertaste that not everyone enjoys.
- **Cashew Milk:** Creamier than almond milk, cashew milk offers a rich texture with a buttery flavor that can enhance the overall taste of your coffee.

### The Effect on Taste

Switching from dairy milk to plant-based alternatives can significantly affect taste. Each option brings distinct flavors and sweetness levels that will interact differently with your coffee. For example:

‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
- **Almond milk**
 is mild and works well with lighter blends but might clash with bold roasts. - **Oat milk**
 enhances the flavor profile, complementing dark roast without overwhelming it. - **Coconut milk**
 can introduce a sweet note, which might clash with certain coffee blends, especially those with fruity or acidic notes. 
### The Impact on Texture

Texture is another crucial aspect to consider. While dairy milk is known for its creamy richness, not all dairy alternatives measure up equally. Here‚Äôs how some compare:

- **Oat milk**
 tends to froth the best, making it a favorite for baristas crafting artistic lattes. - **Almond milk**
 is often thinner, leading to a less creamy mouthfeel, which may make your coffee taste more watery. - **Cashew and soy milk**
 deliver a thicker, creamier texture, mimicking traditional dairy more closely. 
### Choosing the Right Alternative

When picking a dairy alternative, consider what you enjoy most in your coffee experience. If you prefer a creamy texture and sweetness, oat or cashew milks may be your best bets. For something lighter, almond milk works well, albeit with a risk of losing some creaminess.

Be mindful of brands as well‚Äîsome may add sugars and stabilizers that change both the taste and texture of the milk. Always check labels to find the product that best fits your preference.

### Experimenting with Flavor Profiles

The beauty of coffee lies in its versatility. As you explore dairy alternatives, don‚Äôt hesitate to experiment with different combinations. Mixing almond and coconut milk, for instance, can give you a unique taste and texture, enhancing your coffee-drinking experience. Additionally, consider flavored alternatives, such as vanilla or chocolate soy milk, to add an extra layer of delight.

‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
Understanding how dairy alternatives affect the taste and texture of coffee can help you personalize your coffee experience. Whether you are after rich creaminess, a satisfying froth, or new flavor adventures, choose wisely to make each cup your best yet.

### Conclusion

As you sip your morning cup of coffee, it‚Äôs essential to consider what goes into it. Many coffee lovers assume their brew is vegan, but hidden ingredients can surprise even the most diligent consumers. From unexpected additives like gelatin in some brands of coffee creamer to honey used in specialty blends, these hidden ingredients can compromise a vegan lifestyle. That's why it‚Äôs crucial to thoroughly read labels and ask questions, particularly if you‚Äôre visiting a caf√©.

Dairy alternatives have become increasingly popular for coffee enthusiasts, offering a delightful way to enhance flavor and texture without compromising ethics. Almond, soy, oat, and coconut milk can create creamy concoctions that both vegans and non-vegans can enjoy. Each dairy alternative brings its unique flavor profile, adding to your coffee experience. However, not all dairy substitutes are created equal. Some can contain added sugars, thickeners, and flavorings that may not align with a vegan diet. Always check the packaging for those pesky hidden ingredients that could sneak into your favorite coffee choices.

By being informed and proactive about your coffee ingredients, you can fully enjoy your brew while sticking to a vegan lifestyle. Embracing dairy alternatives not only enhances the taste and texture of your coffee but also allows you to make more ethical choices. Equip yourself with the knowledge to ensure your coffee is both delicious and vegan, turning your everyday cup into a mindful ritual.",1,1741640086.0,EasyVegan,0,1.0,False
1j894ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1j894ra/anxiety_questions/,Anxiety questions,"Hey fellow decaf survivors!

So two weeks ago I started to get anxious and lightheaded the only thing I could link it to was caffeine intake reduction. I have been consuming 4-6 coffees daily past few years (certainly more than 5). I always had first two coffees on an empty stomach which was giving me a nice dopamine kick! Recently I must have bought some lighter coffee and consumed only 2 daily for a week, which made me lightheaded and anxious. I realized that this might be linked to caffeine withdrawal, this made me realize how dependent on coffee I am so I decided to quit. Cold turkey. Well, I wasn‚Äôt expecting that to be that unpleasant. Today is 10th day of being caffeine free (almost as I drink one decaf coffee daily which might contain few mg of caffeine). First two days were textbook, I was constantly tired and had terrible, monstrous headaches(there are no words to describe how serious they were). Then all ‚Äúclassic symptoms‚Äù subsided, but Im lightheaded all the time(it is a feeling like a would drink a little bit of alcohol) and I have constant anxiety, which is terrible. I have never had a panic attack in my life before, and past week I had at least 3. Now Im trying to figure out what is the best way forward. So I have few questions to you who managed to go through similar story.

1) is the anxiety gets only better, or it might be getting worse before it starts to get better?The past 10 days were emotional rollercoaster for me and Im afraid that if it might still get worse I have to reconsider reintroducing small dose of caffeine otherwise I simply wont make it.
2) did you also experience the anxiety to get worse at the time you used to consume caffeine? Personally I used to drink all my coffees between 8am and 1pm. Now this is the time when my anxiety peaks and it is gone magically around 7-8pm
3) did you also started to get anxious about spending time in the places where you consumed the caffeine? Personally I want to spend all the time outside, getting back home makes me anxious.
4) did you also experience being lightheaded constantly (Im not sure if this is linked to caffeine withdrawal or maybe this is something else I should consult with a doctor)",1,1741640034.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I come from a different community that gravitates around feeding people called Feedism or Feederism. I myself am midsize or ‚ÄúBBW‚Äù if you don‚Äôt like that, stop reading and go elsewhere. I‚Äôm comfortable with myself and do not give two shits about someone's opinion of me. Everything I support is based on enthusiastic consent, nothing less. Just so we are clear.

I enjoy being a dominant person, someone who takes control, and sets the scene that I want. I crave servitude and subservience from others. In Feedism, I would be considered a feeder. 

So why am I here? I get clients to pay me to sext them. Humiliate them. Degrade them. Entertain their fantasies. Or encourage them. Exclusive erotica chat for lonely horny people.
A few of the ‚Äúfeedees‚Äù that messaged me for sessions turned out to be subs that wanted me to ruin them. To berate and drain them of both their dignity and money. I had a client pay me, then beg me to ruin him physically and put him in the hospital if that paints a picture. I didn't do it obviously but he was one of my firsts that turned me on to Findom.

And no, I was not born yesterday and will not reply to your pathetic attempt to get free shit out of me. If you are looking for a woman to fulfill your sexual and social needs and do not want to pay, go somewhere else. You wouldn't walk into a club with fifty cents and expect women to pay attention to you, would you? Same concept.

If you have found this and are a finsub, know that I am not desperate for money and have a 9-5. I do this for fun and my own depraved sexual needs. I don‚Äôt care if you work at Wendy's or you‚Äôre a CEO at a fortune 500 company. I want fun just as much as you do. I will not take your money and ghost. I‚Äôve been doing this for a while but from another name.

It is in the stolen glances across a crowded room, the warmth of a hand intertwined with another, and the quiet comfort of knowing someone is always there.

True love is not found in grand gestures alone but in the little things-the way one person remembers how the other takes their coffee, the way they pull a blanket over them when they fall asleep, or how they listen to their dreams as if they were their own. It is in laughter that echoes through late-night conversations and the unspoken words that rest in the spaces between breaths.

Love is patient, enduring through storms and standing resilient against the winds of change. It is not perfect, but it does not need to be. It thrives in imperfections, in learning, in growing together. It is the courage to be vulnerable, to let someone see the depths of your soul, and to trust that they will cherish it.

Even cabal coins where the majority of the stock is owned by a team are suffering. Obviously this will change as George Harrison once said ‚ÄúAll things must pass‚Äù. When? I do not know, but it will be soon

**Miami Event**

I will now cut the waffle, how is Kendu doing as all else crumbles?

Kendu is doing pretty well, i am very proud of how we are doing.

NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are making merch for the Miami Event at the end of this month(I think the market will have turned around by then), this is gonna be a huge event and get a lot of eyes on Kendu.

NoSleep305 are the same team who made the Kendu mural, they are heroes in the Kendu Community.

Stayseaart has also made a Kendu cocktail menu for the event which all have Kendu Energy in them. They sound absolutely amazing and I wish I could go, especially in the Miami Heat :)

**New Kendu Product**

We now have Kendu Beer!!!

This adds to our selection of IRL businesses. Kendu Beer now joins: Kendu Energy, Kendu Gum, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Pendants, Kendu Merch, Kendu Animation and Kendu Games.

**Why invest in Kendu:**

When you invest in Kendu you aren‚Äôt choosing a random meme coin. You are buying shares of a brand, just like Nike, Apple, Ikea. You are picking a brand that specialises in many, many businesses.¬†

Just like Mercedes Benz represents luxury, class and success. Kendu represents a way for the common man to buy a Mercedes, Kendu represents the belief that a common man, with patience, determination and motivation, can achieve anything. At Kendu we have the can do mentality. That if we band together, we can achieve anything!!!

Cement yourself in the Memecoin Hall of Fame

Question:

what other coins have all this IRL stuff?

Answer:

No one, Kendu is one of a kind.

Skip the Starbucks and buy some Kendu. Skipping a Frappuccino(ik they‚Äôre nice), could make you $5000

Seriously Kendu is your chance. This is the Shib 2021 opportunity.

If you‚Äôre panicking, please don‚Äôt. This is all market manipulation, the bull run is coming, do not sell your crypto and let the elites take your bag for cheap!!!

Dear \[NAME\],

I'm seeking representation for my debut novel, *Grace & Jo Have Never Solved a* *Murder,* a 65,000-word cozy mystery. I‚Äôm reaching out because you‚Äôd requested mystery manuscripts.

Fans of *Finlay Donovan is Killing It* by Elle Cosimano, as well as *Vera Wong‚Äôs Unsolicited Advice for Murderers* by Jesse Q. Sutano will enjoy unraveling the book‚Äôs subtle hints while getting to know its witty and wise female main characters.

Grace Anderson moves from Florida to Philadelphia to shake up her stale life. She gets a job via a temp agency as the assistant to up-and-coming artist Garrett Baros. Grace is steadily adjusting to the new job, new city, and new (yet still unpacked) apartment when she discovers Garrett‚Äôs dead body in his studio.¬†

Traumatized and unemployed, Grace is floored when Garrett‚Äôs widow, Jo, shows up at her door and offers her a job. But Jo only needs assistance with one thing: solving Garrett‚Äôs murder, something she doesn‚Äôt trust the police to handle. Grace doesn‚Äôt want to return to Florida with her tail between her legs, but she‚Äôs also clearly unqualified to investigate a crime. Grace hesitantly agrees to work for Jo, but while Jo plans to solve Garrett‚Äôs murder, Grace is just hoping they stay out of trouble until the police crack the case.

As the women work through Jo‚Äôs YouTube-inspired ‚Äúmurder board,‚Äù they pose as travel agents, retired strippers, and history buffs, each lie tailored to help them get closer to the truth. Grace balances her blossoming friendship with Jo and her secret communication with the (painfully handsome) officer working Garrett‚Äôs case, eventually realizing it‚Äôs not only Jo who needs closure from Garrett‚Äôs murder. But when the killer is revealed, Grace can‚Äôt help but wonder if Jo would be better off not having answers.

I have a journalism degree and a minor in English, which has helped me keep a steady flow of freelance work while being a stay-at-home mom. In my previous life as a marketing copywriter, I helped small businesses grow their customer base through websites and social media. When I‚Äôm not working on my latest ADHD hyper-fixation or chauffeuring my five-year-old to gymnastics, I like to disassociate via the Sims 4.

I‚Äôm currently writing a sequel to this novel.

The first chapter of my manuscript is below, but I‚Äôd love to send you the complete project. Thank you for your consideration.

Until next crime,

\[NAME\]  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**First 261 words:**

Workplace homicides account for a small number of murders. It‚Äôs much more likely to be the spouse.

As Grace Anderson stood in her kitchen, sipping her morning coffee, she thought about the random true crime statistics her cousin Maya shared with her against her will. Even now, decades after Maya had toned down her love of crimes of passion and revenge, Grace would think of these little nuggets of information without warning. While grocery shopping, she‚Äôd remember Alaska had more serial killers than any other state. In the middle of a massage, just as the therapist found that knot in her back, she remembered summer was the season when most murders occurred. So it wasn‚Äôt odd that she was thinking about workplace homicide in the middle of her still-unpacked apartment. It didn‚Äôt feel like a sign of foreshadowing.

Grace‚Äôs intuition told her it would be a good day. She‚Äôd woken up before her alarm. Her messy brown curls were somehow coaxed into a flattering position without her needing to rewash, apply dry shampoo, or throw her hair into a high bun. The outfit she set out last night still looked good this morning, a floral blouse with a pair of yoga pants cosplaying as dress slacks. Grace felt there was something empowering about a pair of pants that looked office-appropriate but would allow you to do a split. You know, in an emergency.

It was September 6th,¬† just over a month since she first crossed the threshold of her apartment, and exactly a month since she‚Äôd started working for Garrett Baros.",1,1741639592.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

I'm a \~40 year old American that has been living in Thailand for about 7 years. I have taken Thai classes and speak near fluent Thai, I can also read and write. I have been single for about 3 years and can't seem to find anyone that's interested in me. I have been told I am attractive enough and get along with almost everyone great. Not overweight or odd in any way, just an average guy of average height that has good intentions. Maybe the most unattractive thing about me is that I don't engage in social media.



I work remotely for clients in the USA at home and at night mostly so my exposure is daytime hours from noon until 8PM or so. I do not have the luxury of having a good social network or office environment to mine (small company all WFH). I am financially well off by US standards with a successful business. 

  
I've tried the dating apps for years. They're junk, full of working girls, party girls, and those that immediately un-match with me when they find out I live in Thailand and speak Thai. Usually one of the first questions is ""How long you live here"" and then they're gone. It seems to me that the majority of girls using the apps are not interested in a real relationship, rather they are using them to find and exploit newbies for a quick buck or a night out. Most also won't talk/engage and are not really interested in meeting in person. I've been told ""I don't like farang Thai style"", ""I only want LDR"", ""Why you speak Thai you lie have mia"", etc. Many mentally ill people as well that go off the handle. What's funny is now it is totally opposite from when I first arrived when I had many girls that were interested in meeting me.

  
3.5 years ago I was so frustrated I engaged with a matchmaking agency--big mistake. I found that many of the girls who sign up for those are serial manipulators and have sugar daddies (mostly Koreans and Japanese) they are stringing along. I had many trying to push off meeting me for ""months"" while they had a beau in country. Out of the ""20,000"" girls in the database I only had 1 match that wanted to meet me.

I wound up with a very attractive gal and she tortured me for 8 months until I finally cut the cord. Seriously evil narcissist. I'm now convinced she had multiple men she was playing while she was with me. She is now doing the rotate out of Korea/Japan gig staying with the uncles on entry visas. Way immature for a 33 year old, lied to my face, would start fights daily for no reason, etc. I would highly recommend to avoid the matchmakers at all costs. My fault for being desperate.



Before this I had two girlfriends for a short period. One was mentally ill--a nice person but really out there. The other gal I dated was a VISA chick--she wanted to leave Thailand at all costs, so I wasn't fitting the bill by living here.



I don't party or drink, so I don't go to bars. I am fairly convinced most of the girls hanging in bars and night clubs would not be interested in a non-paid relationship anyways, but I am not opposed to getting myself out in that environment if it worked. I have tried developing rapport with girls working in eyeglass shops, coffee shops, etc. and asked them out in person--none of this has worked, probably because they know I've been here a while and see me regularly.



I also have attended professional society events and tried meetups (the last one I counted 24 farang men and literally 1 farang girl). I work a lot these days and to be fair it has been a while since I've focused on getting out. There are usually conflicts during the week when most are held since I work at night. I seem to remember there used to be speed dating in Bangkok on the weekends, but I don't see it happening much anymore.

  
I also think (hypothesis) that many Thai girls have enough guys they chat with on their phone from the dating apps that they have the emotional/social network they desire in life and are content. They can get free sex anytime they want, so why bother to develop an old school pair bonding relationship? I am also guessing the office girls are just burnt out and don't have the energy to go out or worry about having a boyfriend.

  
I asked one of my Thai employees (female) what she thought I should do and she didn't have much of an answer for me. She suggested I look for opportunities where there are social events organized around self improvement to find 'good people' that are putting in effort to better themselves. I like this idea and plan to try it when I can, if I can find such events to participate in.



So, where are all the non narcissist girls at that are interested in meeting a nice guy?",0,1741639489.0,Bangkok,25,0.39,False

He was a quiet man and didn't like to talk much about his service, but was extremely proud to have made that sacrifice for his country.

I'm thinking that a good way to honor his life and service would be to serve other veterans in some way. Can anyone suggest a good way to do that, most specifically in the Seattle area? Maybe you've helped vets in some way and would like to share your experience. Or maybe you're a vet and would like suggest what's been most meaningful to you.

Stuff that goes beyond general UX design and research principles.","I am happy to self teach myself, but lately I have struggled to figure out what to even be trying to learn. Recently it dawned on me that I learned best when I had good prompts/challenges/assignments. I already have relevant undergraduate experience and an MS in HCI, so you could say I've already gone the ""paid course"" route in the heaviest way possible. In those environments, learning awesome high-quality approaches, practices, and methods was easy - they were everywhere and literally handed to me to absorb. If anything, I was drowning in them. I never had to learn to figure out what to learn...

But after working for 5+ years in what is essentially a fully remote simple ecommerce UX optimization role, and not being located in a sort of tech-social-hub like where many of peers are in SF, SEA, or NYC., I'm feeling woefully disconnected from the cutting edge.

   * (I'm frustrated that just when I seem to need ADP list type mentoring, it seems to be unravelling...should I still give it a shot)

I had a player unfortunately leave due to what's going on with Federal Jobs. 
So right now, the campaign is me (man), and 4 players (3 men and 1 woman), ages ranges from mid twenties to later 30s. We are all friends outside of the game, however, I want to make sure the group is balanced and ensure everyone feels welcome, which is why I am looking for a woman for this spot.

The game is held weekly on Wed at 6 PM near St Mark's Coffee House (my house), and runs for 4 hours. 
The party is right now level 6, composed of a Fighter, Barbarian, Cleric and Wizard. I try to my best to ensure backgrounds are connected to each other, for example, almost every player is connected in one way or another to two different players and to the overall arching story. I will work with you on the background to fill in the details, there is nothing technically forbidden in terms off species/classes, I will consider homebrew on a case by case. You will start with magical items to bring you in line with the other players, I will also homebrew magical items to better fit the character concept if needed.

I can't really say what would be RP/Combat split, it varies from session to session, sometimes it is combat heavy, sometimes the entire session is spent RPing.
I do not pull any punches when it come to combat, but I also make sure the fights are balanced and appropriate.


Let me know if you have any questions, and I can also send information about the world and what the party is doing. We are skipping the session this Wed as one of us is flying, but the next one is next Wed the 19th. So there is time to join and get everything ready!",0,1741639404.0,DenverGamers,1,0.44,False

1j88i7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganuk/comments/1j88i7r/virgin_atlantic_flight_vegan_meals/,Virgin Atlantic Flight Vegan Meals,"Just wanted to add my experience of the meals served in economy on a Virgin Atlantic flight recently. It was around 10 hours each way so we were served a variety of meals throughout. I forgot to take a photo of the first meal on the night flight which was a vegetable chickpea cottage pie which was alright, probably the nicest meal of the flights. It had a good amount of seasoning and was quite hearty. 

The first photo is the breakfast from the first flight. It was quite standard (potatoes, mushrooms, tomato, beans) and I wasn't able to eat it unfortunately but it did smell good. The bircher looked really delicious.

Second photo is the main meal on the flight home. It was a potato curry with rice and what I think were like potato vada. The curry was nice enough. I tried some of the salad (chickpea, quinoa, bulgar wheat, corn, etc) but it was a bit too vinegary for me, not terrible though. The cake was similar to a red velvet, quite sweet, I only tried a bite.

Third and fourth photos are of an oat milk sachet which they had readily available for tea/coffee, it was great to have!

Fifth photo is of the mid-flight wrap. It was a wholemeal wrap full of mixed roasted veg. I couldn't identify any sauce in the wrap. The veg tasted a bit bitter which wasn't so nice.

The last photo is the final meal on the flight home. It was a nice smelling pasta with broccoli and carrot, and mixed fruit bowl. It tasted quite basic but at the same time quite nice. The fruit tasted nice and fresh. A decent meal.

Overall I was surprised by how many meals we got haha. The variety of the meals was quite nice. Some could have been a bit nicer but I wasn't expecting much and got more than I hoped for! Definitely can't fault the variety and most of the meals were nice.

1j88h54,https://www.reddit.com/r/cork/comments/1j88h54/southern_suburb_pubs_and_coffee/,Southern suburb pubs (and coffee),"Following up on recent post about top 5 pubs, it made me think about stuff outside of the centre of town‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm moving back to Cork shortly, having been away for a long time, and will be living in central southern burbs. And I realize that on any trip back, I‚Äôve wanted to be able to go for a couple pints without going into town (and I will want to once I‚Äôve moved) but I struggle to find anywhere appealing.

It‚Äôs a personal preference thing maybe but I really don‚Äôt like any of the big pubs in Douglas Village. I won‚Äôt name them but they‚Äôre all pretty much the same for me and severely lacking in any character or comfort or life. Likewise alot of the larger pubs in Ballinlough, Ballintemple, Blackrock, etc.

There‚Äôs such big populations in these areas, there must be people who‚Äôd love an actual decent pub to go to without always going into town. The docks and Douglas St is the closest with something approaching what I‚Äôm talking about. I kinda hate buying into the ‚Äúchain‚Äù but something like some of Benny McCabe‚Äôs places. He knows what he‚Äôs doing in fairness. There are some ok, smaller, very local, old school places, like on Blackrock Rd. But they‚Äôre just that; only ok.

Am I missing something? Is there a hidden gem somewhere? I‚Äôve even dreamed about opening my own sometime. Or am I being an insufferable wanker and I should just enjoy my ‚Äúsuburban‚Äù pub? Or fuck off into town with myself.

Similar question on coffee shops. There seems to be a bit more‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs Soma on Well Rd, couple ok places in Blackrock Village, some carts around the marina and Ballinlough, Dose in Turners Cross‚Ä¶ But still a long walk from most places to anywhere decent and nothing good ever seems to survive in Douglas Village black spot.

1j88fhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j88fhn/got_dumped_by_an_anxiously_attached_person_his/,Got dumped by an anxiously attached person (his claim). I am very confused by his recent text messages to me regarding picking up my things (plus background),"We dated for 8 months. All the basic level compatibility was there; i.e., life view, goals, politically adjacent, beliefs, interest in therapy and growing together (and we had a few miscommunications but they were resolved very respectfully). 



**Background to the breakup (look further down for current situation)**

I had an issue, which we had discussed a few times. I shut down when I get overwhelmed. This isn't complete shut down, except once (which i can describe more further). Once it was on a ski slope - i panicked bc it was my second time ever skiing and it was a big slope. I ended up crying. I told him as it was happening that it was too busy, too many people. He got really anxious and was trying to get me to tell him what he did wrong, but the thing is he didn't do anything wrong. We went to the ski lodge and got water and i am barely holding it together to not cry in the lodge (i'm a freaking adult woman!) and i just told him i need to calm down and time to process everything but it isn't him. I again reiterate this at dinner, when he tried to get me to explain this more, but again it is in public and I was nearing tears again. this is very much not like me, by the way, but I had a really bad time the first time i tried to ski, and I've had a number of winter sports related injuries. This example was used in his break up conversation to me. I later did tell him what happened, which was me having a panic attack and I basically felt super ashamed that I wasn't good enough and it was just too much for me. This is when he told me he doesn't like me shutting down and he really needs me to communicate IN THE MOMENT. This is the key part, btw. 



Another shut down incident that happened where I had just gotten back from a funeral (my grandfather's). He had wanted to attend but I had told him it was not the time to be meeting my whole extended family. I was very involved with the funeral, staying with my very religious grandmother who just lost her husband, and it was also 1000 miles away from where we live. When I got back, we had plans to meet up with our kids for dinner that night (our kids are young). He calls me at 5pm to tell me that he's driving to khols to pick up pants for his oldest kid. This is a 20 minute drive away from where I live and where we were planning on eating. Anyway, the whole thing was poor time management, and I was pretty upset by the issue, but he was trying to get me to talk while he had me on speaker phone. I couldn't speak. I was very overwhelmed by all this and I know that I didn't do a great job communicating time expectations. He told me he was confused, and I admit that I did not do a great job of communicating how this seemed like he was not prioritizing me after i got back from losing my grandfather and I hadn't seen him in a week. BUT I DID COMMUNICATE IT TWO HOURS LATER. We had a long conversation about it. It was very respectful and healthy communication about it. I told him some day I will be able to communicate in the moment. I am just not there yet. 



The final shutdown happened. We were traveling home via airplane. He said something about a woman on our flight, which I felt was very judgmental, and it took me down a bit of a tailspin and I was pretty angry. I know that that was not ok. The father of my children used to say these things about other people, and he was a nightmare in airports. It was a bad combination. I told him, we can't be sure of any of that about the woman. And as we tried to find food, I felt more and more overwhelmed. I could barely eat. He obviously noticed. He bought me a chocolate shake and cookies, but I was angry and I couldn't speak. I couldn't talk to him in the moment. I tried to talk to him after we got to his house, but it was 1am and he decided he'd go out and shovel snow. I tried to talk about it with him during coffee, but even after shoveling snow, my car got stuck and the front bumper ended up coming off (but still drivable), and I cried. I didn't tell him why I was crying. But I had to get to work, as now I was running late since it took so long to get the car out of the snowbank. I tried to talk to him later, but he was basically distant at that point.  



He broke up with me a week after this last incident. To me, the shutting down feels like an excuse. And I told him, it seems like this is self-sabotage. And before we really get into it, there was a lot of distancing happening prior to these incidents on his part. He has been very stressed out because of a new job that has him traveling a lot, which I didn't mind. I had communicated my issues effectively, and appropriately by saying things like ""it seems you are pulling away"" or ""your texting has slowed down"" and the sex also started to slow down. He would always reassure me that he was just stressed from the new job and it wasn't me. I believed him. We do not need to necessarily go down why he really broke up with me. But I suspect there was a LOT he was not telling me. So i can only speculate. Key takeaway, though, is he is a serious workaholic, and I mean, like real. He missed his daughter's play to go work. I'm actually not put off by it.



I tried to apologize for my behavior several times. I know my behavior was not ok. I tried to explain to him I need to be able to process what I am feeling and I don't always know. I don't know how to come back from a shutdown - yet. But I am working on all this with a therapist. It's all happening. I'm working on it. It is important to me, no matter who I am with because I want a healthy relationship after being in a toxic one. And I did really try to be vulnerable and communicate over all sorts of issues, such as the pulling away, and telling him things that were important to me, and establishing boundaries and communicating them. 

**Relevant part!**

  
Anyway, it has been a few weeks since we broke up. He is texting me now to drop off my things I had at his place. I had offered him a neutral space to drop them off at a time that is convenient to him and I can pick up when it works for me OR he could drop them off at my place on Monday afternoon. **He never responded to that**. Today, Monday, I told him I'd like my things between 430 and 530, as I had plans. And he tells me he is in California. WTF! He couldn't even tell me he was leaving when trying to arrange a time to pick up my stuff? He then says I can either wait for him to come back or I can go to his house to pick things up and grab everything. He even says if I wait until he comes back, we can scour his house together for the remainder of my things. I'm happy to post text messages. 

  
WHAT IS GOING ON? I'm deeply confused by him trying to offer time to actually meet up to hand off the items. I know this is long.  I really loved him, (foolishly, it seems) so I'm very conflicted by all this in trying to figure out if he's trying to get back with me or what. I know the healthy thing to do is to move on, but a small voice in my head is definitely wanting him back, and I may be trying to read too much into things that I shouldn't. 

  
TLDR: Boyfriend broke up with me over things I was actively working on, despite some good compatibility and acceptance of his behaviors; now seems to be really wishy washy on how we do the handoff for all my things still at his house. I do not know how to proceed. Should I go to his (unlocked) house and grab them while he is away (though one thing is still in his car so I'll have to deal with him at some point), or should I wait for him to return and go through his house ""together""?

My grandmother informed me that my mom complained to her that I do not talk to her (my mom) or share anything with her. 
In the past I would‚Äôve tried to defend myself but this time I just went ‚Äúhmmm‚Äù and went about my business.  My mother is a woman who:

1. interprets EVERYTHING I say negatively. Even if I am agreeing with her, she will find a way to say I‚Äôm ‚Äúarguing‚Äù with her. 
2. either twists my words or straight up LIES and tells people I‚Äôve said things I never did 
3. In the past whenever I shared something sensitive with her, I‚Äôd find out that she told someone else about it
4. has read my diary twice (as far as I know.) once in childhood and once in adulthood and had a mental breakdown over me calling her overbearing. 
5. All my life has used me as a soundboard for hours but as soon as I try to chime in shows no interest, interrupts me and moves the conversation back to herself. 
6. Criticizes everything I do and wear - she loves to take it up a notch when family is around and makes jokes at my expense 
7. Used to beat me when I was little. I don‚Äôt care how long ago it was, that fear and pain doesn‚Äôt go away
8. Told me repeatedly that she is not my friend and I am the reason she couldn‚Äôt do so many things she wanted to 
9. Gets upset when I don‚Äôt read her thoughts. She literally scolded me this morning because she had to ask me to make coffee instead of me just assuming she wanted some. 

This is just off the top of my head. I used to think I was overly sensitive until a family member I hadn‚Äôt seen in years asked me ‚Äúis your mom nice to you these days?‚Äù I was so taken aback, I didn‚Äôt realize anyone else saw it. 
I‚Äôm at the point where I no longer care to protect her from the consequences of her actions. Why should I continue to be vulnerable with her when she abuses it over and over with no remorse? 
I suspect that she‚Äôs just embarrassed that she can‚Äôt tell people things about me anymore because I refuse to open up to her. We live in the same house for now but I will continue to guard my inner world. ",7,1741638271.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I'm hoping that writing some of this down can help organise my thoughts as I'm struggling to get my point across to my husband. We‚Äôve been having issues for a while, I believe it‚Äôs due to the way he treats me - he genuinely doesn‚Äôt seem to believe he‚Äôs doing anything wrong. Any arguments/discussions are basically circular now and neither of us seem to be able to see the other‚Äôs point of view. Our sex life is non-existent atm as I‚Äôm unwilling, but we were having sex until 8 weeks ago when things really fell apart. There is a history of past infidelity on his part which he claims is where our issues are stemming from as he believes I can't move on, I think its more than that.

This weekend is a good example of how things currently are. I spent most of the weekend trying to avoid him as when I‚Äôd come home from work on Friday the house stunk of weed, so much so our 16yr old commented. I tend to avoid conflict, so hadn‚Äôt said anything until he demanded 3 times that I needed to say why I was walking round with a face like a slapped arse as we needed to be communicating more.

When I did eventually say what was bothering me I was told I was out of order, he was near suicidal 3 weeks ago, would I prefer he was still like that as he was using the weed to cope? He‚Äôd just got his head back in the game but I‚Äôm derailing it. He‚Äôs not prepared to live like this, I‚Äôm policing him, he‚Äôs done, he‚Äôs going to leave, if I want to go to war then he‚Äôs prepared, He‚Äôs been trying to be the best man he can but I'm not doing anything to make our situation better.

He goes on and on about why I‚Äôm out of order until I‚Äôm worn down. Will tell me that we need to communicate but when I do I‚Äôm always in the wrong. I‚Äôve had to point out I‚Äôm entitled to my own feelings and emotions in past arguments - he‚Äôll say that I am - immediately followed by a ‚Äòbut‚Äô as to how they affect him and his mental health. I‚Äôm well aware that by voicing anything he views negatively towards him will just result in hearing about how I‚Äôm risking his head going which means he can‚Äôt earn - is that what I want etc (he is the main earner). Mentioned that he needs sex and as his wife, that's what wives do, did I want him to just go out fucking?

Ended with him shutting himself away to play computer games for the remainder of the evening

Next morning - I‚Äôm getting the kids up for school, walked the dogs, getting ready for work - he is in bed. Comes down to tell me I‚Äôm being passive aggressive for not making him a coffee whilst he stays in bed working. Said can we both agree that the deal is he gets 2 coffees in the morning. When I said I wasn‚Äôt sure how things had been left after the previous day he then talked at me for 20mins about how he was working, he paid the bills, he wasn‚Äôt prepared to put up with this from me, again mentioned that he doesn‚Äôt want to go to war but he would.

He stood over me, pointing, gritting his teeth, calling me a cunt, to the point I cry. I‚Äôm then told off as our 16yr old saw and asked if I‚Äôm ok. Repeatedly asked why I would let our 16yr old see me like that (I had to take him to school for an early revision session for his mocks and he‚Äôd already said that he didn‚Äôt want his dad taking him as it would stress him out)
.
Came back to him more conciliatory but told I was frustrating him and that‚Äôs why he blows up. Talked at for another 15mins about how he‚Äôs trying, he thinks if we can just get past ‚Äòthis‚Äô life is going to be great, he wants intimacy and as I‚Äôm withdrawn so how else is he supposed to act. He doesn‚Äôt want to fight but I‚Äôm pushing him. Usually ends in the same manner with both of us feeling frustrated that we can‚Äôt see the others point of view

It's rumble on this evening which is when he mentioned the wife's role being to look after her man again and asked me to answer how long should a man be expected to stay in a marriage when not getting any sex.

When I pushed back on the wife‚Äôs role bit he asked what I thought a wife‚Äôs role was and when I answered that i didn‚Äôt think there are roles, it‚Äôs meant to be a partnership where we both work together for the good of the family - he replied to tell me if it was a partnership like I believed then I should put up with his ranting at me. That I couldn‚Äôt have it both ways. Again told that he had done all the work he needed to do on himself and I‚Äôd changed nothing. But when pressed on what I need to change the only thing he ever mentions is having more sex.

I'm really struggling to understand his point, he's very fixated on me taking responsibility for the part he believes I've played in how we are now but I'm unwilling to acquiesce - so we are at a stalemate.

So I'm looking for some outsider opinions. From the brief snapshot of our marriage albeit from my side only - am I at fault?",3,1741638268.0,MNTrolls,2,1.0,False

I just missed a doctor's appointment. 

I had it in my work calendar as a 3:30pm appointment.

Earlier today, I double checked the time and it said 4:50pm - I live about an hour away from my current doctor's office so this made perfect sense to me - ""I must have put the appointment in my work calendar for when I had to LEAVE work to get to my appointment.""

All day, I kept an eye on the time and just wished I could go early because I hate waiting. 

At 3:15, I clock out (I work from home), get my stuff together, and head out by 3:25ish so I can stop for an iced tea for my drive. 

Well...I pull into the drive thru of my coffee shop, pause what I'm listening to, and see a ""Let's us know when you arrive!"" message from my doctor's office....my appointment was at 3:50pm. Not 4:50pm. 

After getting home, I checked my email, online chart, texts, everything from my doctor's office and NOTHING says ""4:50"" it's all ""3:50"" - I have no idea how I did that but this is now the 2nd in-person doctor's appointment I've missed in a row.

Then I‚Äôve bought Pentair Everpure Claris which gave me slightly better results than my own or TWW. And then I realised that the only other option left was the BestMax Premium filters since it appears lots of speciality cafes use them and BOOM! Result! The difference is incredible!

1j88bxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1j88bxb/is_good_good_enough/,"Is Good, Good Enough?","Late last year, I met at a coffee shop with an individual who was interested in learning about Jesus and about the Bible. He described himself as someone ‚Äúclose‚Äù to converting. But before he could, he was confused about something. He said something like, ‚ÄúNone of my family members are Christians but all of them are good people.‚Äù So his question was, why do I need Christianity if I can be a good person without it?¬†

In his question, he assumed that the goal of human life is being a good person. If that is the case, then he had a point. Why does anyone need Jesus if he can be good without Him?¬†

But what if God‚Äôs goal for our human life is different than being good or at least His definition of good is different than ours? God tells us in the Bible in Isaiah 55:9 ‚ÄúFor as the heavens are higher than the earth, / So My ways are higher than your ways, / And My thoughts higher than your thoughts.‚Äù God views things from a different angle than we do and we can‚Äôt rely on cultural or societal or even religious standards to tell us how to live life.¬†

But the passage doesn‚Äôt end there. ‚ÄúFor just as the rain comes down / And the snow from heaven, / And does not return there, / Until it waters the earth‚Ä¶So will my word be which goes forth from My mouth‚Ä¶It will accomplish what I delight in (v. 10-11).‚Äù Yes, the heavens are higher than the earth, but the rain and the snow descend from that lofty place to the earth to grow something there. In the same way, God thinks and acts differently than we do, **but** He delights in revealing His thoughts and ways through His word. What does God‚Äôs word say about this?

When Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they disobeyed God and we may highlight this event as the point when the downward spiral of the human race began. But the sin of disobeying God in that moment was the injection point for **something much worse-sin**. Sometimes the Bible talks about sin as an act and sometimes it talks about sin as the personification of a person. One of the best examples, in my opinion, is when God warns Cain about his intention to kill Abel by saying, ‚ÄúSin is crouching at the door; and his desire is for you, but you must rule over him (Gen. 4:7).‚Äù That indwelling sin, along with death, was not just something that plagued those first few generations of man, but it was ‚Äúpassed on to all men (Rom. 5:12).‚Äù¬†

Even though we have the knowledge of good and we have the desire to do good, we don‚Äôt have the ability to do good. Romans 7:19-20 say, ‚ÄúFor I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice. But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me.‚Äù There is something inside of us that overpowers our will to do good. Even if we ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù in doing good, God describes our righteous deeds as ‚Äúfilthy rags,‚Äù because they are tainted by sin (Isaiah 64:6). That‚Äôs why Jesus **not only** needed to die for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) **but** to annul the body of sin within us (Romans 6:6).¬†

Ok so now we see something of God‚Äôs perspective on being good. Basically fallen human beings can‚Äôt be good, so‚Ä¶ Is there anyone who can be? Yes! Mark 10:18 says, **‚ÄúNo one is good except One‚ÄìGod.‚Äù** Only God Himself can live a life that is approved. That‚Äôs why during one night when a man named Nicodemus came to Jesus seeking teachings, the counsel of Jesus was simple‚Äì‚ÄúYou must be born anew (John 3:7).‚Äù By believing into Jesus, we can be born anew and this Person who is pleasing to God in every way, can come into us and begin to live a life that pleases God.

Western governments and businesses have for long dictated prices of African exports toensure the continent remains a raw material-producing hub and not an industrial production hub. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Africa exported approximately $406 billion in natural resources during 2021. However, due to the foreign control over the price and processing, African nations receive merely a fraction of this amount. The World Bank estimates that while Africa possesses 30% of the global mineral deposits, it has only 3% of global manufacturing production, illustrating how few value-addedoperations are taking place within the continent.

One of the most blatant examples of such exploitation is the mining sector. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which produces over 70% of the world's cobalt‚Äîa crucial ingredient in electric vehicle and electronics batteries‚Äîbenefits little from itsearnings. Cobalt mining is controlled by foreign groups, primarilyWestern and Chinese companies, and most of it is shipped abroadin its raw state to be processed elsewhere. The same holds true for the cocoa industry. While West Africa produces about 70% of the world's cocoa, the Western-controlled chocolate industry earnsover $130 billion annually, with an infinitesimal percentagereturning to African farmers, the majority being poor.

A look at global economic history shows that cartels have worked in the past. The best example is OPEC. Before it arose, Western oil companies had complete pricing power, with oil-producing nations at their mercy. But when OPEC started controlling production and prices strategically, its members harvested enormous economic benefits. Today, OPEC nations possess nearly 40% of the world's oil and thus much greater control over their own economic destinies. If African nations used the same approach with key commoditieslike cobalt, lithium, gold, diamonds, coffee, and cocoa, they could possibly dictate the prices of trade at last, instead of being dictated to.

By creating cartels, African nations would be more powerful collectively, and commodity prices could be increased to enhance revenues. A productive cartel of the cobalt and lithium industries alone would increase national incomes substantially, particularly with the demand for these minerals rapidly rising in the renewable energy sector. The world will see a more than 500% boost indemand for lithium and cobalt by 2050 due to the electric vehicle revolution, Bloomberg NEF projects. If Africa could cartelize these resources, it could utilize higher prices as OPEC nations have beenable to do in the oil market.

Western powers, naturally, have opposed any attempt by African nations to take control of their own resources from a long time back. Whenever African governments have tried to nationalize anindustry or increase commodity prices, they were typically met with economic sanctions or even political destabilization. Patrice Lumumba's 1961 assassination in the DRC, widely believed to havebeen orchestrated by Western intelligence agencies, is a stark example of how African economic independence has beenconspired against by foreign powers. The same tactics were directed towards Libya's Muammar Gaddafi when he attempted to introduce an African currency backed by gold to challenge Western monetary domination.

But the game is changing. China has become Africa's biggesttrading partner, with more than $282 billion worth of trade in 2022. China, unlike Western countries, has been willing to enterinto agreements involving the development of infrastructure in return for resources. Chinese investments have supported majorprojects such as the $4 billion Standard Gauge Railway in Kenya and the $3.5 billion Mambilla hydroelectric plant in Nigeria. Despite debt fears, China's entry provides African nations with an alternative to Western-dominated institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, which have in the past used stringent loan conditions to limit economic sovereignty.

Cartels to be successful, though, African governments must put in place the appropriate systems. First, corruption must be controlled. Too frequently, foreign interference and domestic mismanagement undermine collective economic efforts. Nationssuch as Rwanda have demonstrated that strict anti-corruption policies can result in increased economic stability and efficiency. Second, governments need to intervene actively in major industries instead of merely letting multinational companies monopolize the market. Third, funds raised from higher commodity prices need to be plowed back into infrastructure, education, and healthcare. According to a McKinsey & Company report, for each $1 billion invested in African infrastructure, GDP growth is 0.2% higher, underlining the economic dividends of reinvestment.

So long as African countries export raw materials on terms set by foreign markets, the continent will be unable to break free from economic dependence. But if African producers cooperate withone another, they can capture their own industries and build a better future. Industrial cartels provide a means to finally turn the tables‚Äîplacing Africa as price setter, not price taker. With goodpolicies, effective governance, and strategic partnerships, African countries can make sure that their riches really do enrich their people, not foreign multinationals.

Although I focused on African nations in this essay and the importance of creating cartels composed of heavily Keynesian-oriented states, this applies generally to every nation with the majority of their industry centered around extracting raw materials, which are almost always exploited by the global core. Mind you, this principle also applies to Edward Skeletrix‚Äôs ancestral country Haiti, which, although has a lot of subsistence farming, also has a major export agricultural sector and a mining sector that is subject to the exploitative structures created by the imperial core. 

Because of this, and for reasons connected to his personal philosophy which I will explain later on, I believe Edward would strongly support this movement to create industrial, worker-oriented cartels in Africa. This is even supported directly by lyrics from ‚ÄúTypical Rap Song 11‚Äù off of Museum Music, where he says ‚ÄúBae, this ain't no Balenci bag, got it from Africa,‚Äù demonstrating that he is beginning to reject the colonial bourgeois entities that dominate fashion in favor of directly supporting African industry, without greedy white middlemen and without markups dictated by the west. Although you could argue that Edward was contributing against this through his role as a capitalist with his SYCKLI project, it is important to note that all SYCKLI garments and other products were produced in China, which has an key role in the liberation of Africa from its economic and neocolonial shackles for reasons I already went over.

In some ways, the struggles African countries (and other poor nations) face with economic exploitation are like the themes Edward Skeletrix explores in his music, questions of power, control, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world. Just like his lyrics often tackle the absurdity of life and the systems that hold people down, Africa‚Äôs fight to take back control of its resources is about breaking free from a cycle of exploitation. It‚Äôs a real-life example of trying to rewrite a story that‚Äôs been dictated for far too long. In the end, whether it‚Äôs through music or politics, it‚Äôs all about finding a way to take control of your own destiny. The choice is available. It's time to take it.

What are ur guys' thoughts on this? Am I making a stretch here or is this a valid political-economic analysis of our current world and how Edward connects to it as one of the most innovative artists of our time?",2,1741637885.0,edwardskeletrix,4,0.67,False
