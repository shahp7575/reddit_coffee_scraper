The world of nutrition saw a diverse range of news on June 5, 2025, from personal health transformations to the exploration of effective exercise routines. This roundup synthesizes the key developments, offering a comprehensive overview of the day's highlights.

**Personal Transformation and Weight Loss: Adnan Sami's Turning Point**

A significant story broke on June 5th, focusing on singer and music composer Adnan Sami's remarkable weight loss journey. Speaking on Aap Ki Adalat, Sami candidly recounted the pivotal moment that prompted him to shed a staggering 120 kilograms. This transformation wasn’t just about aesthetics; it stemmed from a dire warning from a doctor at Cromwell Hospital in London. The doctor, after reviewing Sami's health checkup, delivered a chilling assessment: ""Mr Sami, your results are on the borderline. If you continue with this lifestyle, I will not be surprised that your parents will find you dead in a hotel room six months from now.""

This stark prognosis served as a wake-up call. Sami detailed the lifestyle that contributed to his poor health, hinting at overindulgence. While not explicitly stated in the summaries, the context suggests this involved unhealthy eating habits. This revelation underscores the profound impact that a physician's warning can have and offers a powerful example of how individuals can be motivated by negative health consequences to embrace significant lifestyle changes. This serves as a reminder of the importance of regular health checkups and the necessity of addressing potential health risks. Sami's experience reinforces the potential for positive change driven by the recognition of serious health threats. This news also highlights the role that family support and concern played in his eventual turnaround.

**The Power of Yoga: Navasana and Core Strength**

Beyond personal anecdotes, the day's news also shed light on effective exercise strategies. Research points to the surprising power of yoga, specifically the Navasana pose (boat pose), as a highly effective core exercise. This piece of news challenges the common perception of yoga as simply a gentle, relaxing activity. While often perceived as calming breathwork, the right yoga postures, according to experts, can deliver workouts comparable to intense gym sessions.

The focus was on Navasana, praised by both researchers and experienced instructors. A study conducted at Auburn University in Montgomery ranked Navasana among the most effective core exercises, rivaling the effectiveness of traditional sit-ups. Sharath Jois, a renowned yoga teacher, even claimed that holding the pose for 25 breaths can rival the effects of doing 100 sit-ups. The study's findings highlight the importance of core strength and the different ways to achieve it, revealing an alternative to traditional gym workouts.

**A Day in the Life of a Nutritionist: Sara Tendulkar's Routine**

Providing insight into the practical application of nutritional expertise, the news also featured a glimpse into the daily routine of Sara Tendulkar, a registered nutritionist and the daughter of Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. Sharing snippets of her day on social media, Sara revealed a lifestyle that blends both health-conscious choices with the realities of modern life.

Her day begins with a familiar ritual for many: a cup of freshly brewed coffee. Following her morning beverage, she prioritizes exercise, choosing to utilize a Pilates Reformer. This demonstrates her commitment to incorporating movement and fitness into her routine, essential for health and well-being. The Instagram post also indicated the ease with which Sara Tendulkar handles getting ready for the day with a quick shower and putting on makeup, which often included a layer of sunscreen, a dab of concealer, and a swipe of lip and cheek tint.

This glimpse into Sara Tendulkar's day provides a relatable example of how a nutrition expert integrates healthy habits into their life. Her morning routine is a testament to the principle that a balanced lifestyle can be achieved even within a busy schedule, making exercise, skincare, and self-care essential components of the day.

**Key Takeaways and Significance**

The nutrition news of June 5, 2025, offers several important takeaways.

Firstly, the story of Adnan Sami emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing health risks proactively. His transformation is a testament to the power of motivation, highlighting the dramatic impact that a serious health warning can have in prompting positive change.

Secondly, the research on Navasana underscores the significance of exploring alternative exercise methods. The findings from Auburn University, along with the insights from Sharath Jois, show that yoga, when practiced correctly, can be a potent tool for achieving core strength and overall fitness, in contrast to assumptions about its gentleness.

Finally, Sara Tendulkar's social media post provides a realistic view of how a nutritionist approaches their day. Her choices of coffee, Pilates and makeup reflect a balance of healthy habits and the demands of daily life, showing the feasibility of integrating health-conscious practices into any lifestyle.

In conclusion, the day's nutrition news highlights the importance of personal health awareness, the exploration of diverse exercise strategies, and the practical application of nutritional expertise. It offers a wealth of information for anyone seeking to make informed choices about their well-being. The stories underscore the continuous evolution of nutritional insights and the ongoing pursuit of effective methods to promote a healthy lifestyle.

1l4tdyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/1l4tdyv/itinerary_check/,Itinerary Check?,"We're coming out to LA from the Boston area with our daughters who are 10 and 12 for an Angel City FC game in late August.  We have three nights and are trying to nail down an intinerary that makes sense.  We will be there from Tuesday-Friday.  We were just there in December and did some things that are not on this list already.  Basically, I am just trying to see if this is reasonable.  Our goal is to avoid traffic as much as possible and be able to walk a little bit to things even though I know LA isn't always the best walking city.  

Tuesday - Arrive around 11, get rental car, In-N-Out near the airport, head to hotel in Santa Monica.  Walk down to Venice and the canals, head back to SM for dinner at Din Tai Fun (daughters like soup dumplings, feels like the kind of place we can't really find near us).

Wednesday - Up early, coffee/Sidecar donuts and walk down to the beach.  Maybe hang at the hotel/rent bikes for a bit and wait for rush hour to pass.  Leave SM around 10 or 11.  We have reservations at Sunset Marquis or Le Parc in WeHo and will eventually need to pick between those.  Senoratown or Guisados for lunch.  Koreatown for dinner (Pigya is the current plan).  Ice cream in Koreatown or back in WeHo.

Between that afternoon and the next morning we'll do some combination of Rodeo Drive (I know its not great but we want to see it)/Greystone Mansion and the Academy Museum.

Thursday - Angel City game is at 7:30 but it sounds like it's best to be there pretty early.  Maybe get there around 3 and walk around the USC campus and find some dinner.  Maybe the Mercado la Paloma.  Hang outside the stadium and see what's happening.  6am flight the next morning.

I would really appreciate any thoughts you have on if the plan makes sense?  A split stay for 3 nights might sound crazy but I feel like it allows us to drive a little less and see a couple parts of the city in more detail.

We've also found an AirBnB in Atwater Village and one Highland Park.  Those neighborhoods sounds awesome but I feel like they are a little out of the way.

1l4tczv,https://i.redd.it/yj6uw244cb5f1.jpeg,Dialling in coffee / seasoning new grinder (ZP6),"I've decided to invest in pour over equipment. I got a Timemore Fish Pro and a ZP6.

Till now, I've brewed three cups of coffee using a recipe from Lance Hedrick: blooming the coffee with 3x the weight of coffee in water for 1 minute, then pouring to the desired weight. 

I brew a 1:15 ratio (15:225). I've ground at three different settings using my ZP6: first at 4, then 4.5 and then 5. All cups finished within a few seconds of 2:30 total brew time, including the 1 minute bloom. The temperature of the water is 93 degrees C. 

The first cup tasted fruity but had an extreme metallic after taste with a very very dry finish. I was so excited to try my new equipment that I did not want to throw away this cup (I shoud have done it).

As I was grinding courser, the cups got less fruity, less flavourful  but also less metallic. At grind size 5, I kind of felt that I was giving up a lot of taste/flavour but decreased the metallic after taste. 

FYI: The first batch of boiled water with the new kettle was thrown away to rinse the 'new' taste from the kettle.

Do you guys have suggestions? I've read that grinders need to be seasoned. Am I getting taste notes of my new grinder? ",1,1749218953.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

\--The Past--

I don't even know where to start, so I guess the very beginning. I met her in a car outside of a Starbucks. Let's call her V. My buddy worked there with her. We smoked weed and listened to music. I thought she was nice, but this was just friends hanging out after work. I didn't see her again for awhile, then she showed back up and was suddenly dating one of my best friends. I saw her a lot over that summer, I would hang out with this friend often, and she was often there too. We developed our own friendship that got a little more flirtatious as the summer went on. Around this same time, it became evident that my friend was cheating on her, she found out and broke up with him. V and I started dating almost immediately after their breakup. There was drama and fallout and hurt feelings with my friend, but we recovered eventually, that's not the story here.

Our relationship was incredible, fun date nights, days of having fun with her and her 3 year old daughter on days she had custody. I got attached to her too, she was even accidentally calling me ""Daddy"" as a confused toddler is known to do, but it melted my heart. But everything happened so fast. She was my first love, I didn't know how to slow down. I tried to keep her too close, and pushed her away in doing so. She left me after about 6 months, saying she just wanted to be alone. She was open about her struggles with depression, treatment and medication resistant, but when we were together I never really saw it. I believed on some level that loving her enough could somehow rescue her from not loving herself.

I tried for months to get her back, to no avail. Then I tried to move on. I had a couple flings, then met my next serious gf later that year. V did contact me again around this time. She asked about my new gf, we chatted, it also seemed like she was dating someone new. It hurt, I still had feelings for her, and I always held a space for her in my heart to return to, if she wanted to. That never happened. I stayed with GF, many years go by of just building a life together, renting a home, raising pets. We decide to leave the state. We hate the heat, the storms, the crowds, the traffic. We move up north. We buy a house, we get engaged, pregnant, COVID hits, baby boy, married, raise our son, work from home. Time sped up, life took over, we became great parents, but never really had time to just be husband and wife.

\--The Present--

For years I never even got a chance to look back, time was just moving so fast. But then I did, I looked back. And I didn't like what I saw. I searched her for name, the first result was her mugshot. She looked so sad, and scared, but still so beautiful after all these years. It became so clear at that point that I never healed properly from our breakup, or maybe even at all. Like I built a dam in my chest to hold back all of the feelings I still had for her, and when I saw that mugshot it was like a 100ft crack formed and now the water is gushing through. I wrestled with it for days, but eventually decided to text her. She was quite surprised that I reached out, but we had a few good chats early on. She opened up with me about a traumatic experience in 2024. I opened up with her about how I was feeling in my marriage, and how much I still feel for her, even all these years later, all these miles apart. There may have even been some flirty messages from her, bringing up old memories of a spicy time. Maybe her conscience took over shortly after as she made it clear that she is not interested in crossing any lines with a married man. I agreed, and recognized that my wife needed to know how I was feeling. I talked about a lot of things with my wife, but left out everything about V. We agreed to work on things, and we are planning to move back. Back to where we met, to be closer to family who can help with our son. We would also be moving back closer to V, and if things don't work out with my wife, I had this fantasy where I could have a coffee with V again. A second first date. Get to know who she is now, both of us changed for the better by the years, and maybe find out that we both like what we see.

If that's the movie ending you want, we're still a long way off. V became harder and harder to reach over the last month or two, replies to my texts getting shorter, or no reply at all. I would still check in with supportive messages every week or two. In case whatever she was feeling wasn't about me, just about where she was at with her grief. Well, it turned out to be the latter. She replied finally this past Tuesday. She told me that she was done, with everything. She laid out a very specific plan to end her life. I shattered. I started to shake. I pleaded with her, I tried to call her phone, for the first time in 14 years. No answer. She was still responding minimally by text, but not backing down. There seemed to be time though, her plan was for when family is out of town, and they are still there. I could barely sleep that night, maybe 2 hours. The next morning I'm texting again, not begging yet, not urgent, just good morning, let me know you're safe when you can. No answer. 1 hour, 2, 3, the texts are getting more urgent now. I tell her I will be contacting her family if she doesn't answer. No answer. I contact her family. Her two sisters, but both live out of state and cannot physically reach her. The only close family near her is her 17 year old daughter. The one who was 3 when we dated. I reach out to her and explain everything. This was heartbreaking. More heartbreaking, was that none of her family seemed surprised this was happening, again. She has done this multiple times in the past with family members, but it was a first for me. V finally texted me back around this time. But nothing to indicate that she would back down. I apologized for involving her family, but her response was ""None of my family is here"" which I read both as ""I'm so alone."" and ""There's no one here to stop what happens next"".

When she sent a final ""peace out"" emoji and turned off her phone, I knew I had to act. I messaged her family that she had shut off her phone, and to call 911. I dialed the non emergency line local to her and requested a welfare check, explaining the texts she sent. I honestly thought she was already driving for the bridge. Thankfully, I got a call from an officer at her home. V was home and she is unharmed. She was taken to the hospital where she will be safe for at least 72 hours. I got goosebumps from the relief I felt. The messages from her family offered a brief glimpse into how deep this pit was that she was in. She never let me know any of that, how many bridges she burned, how alone she was. But as the hours dragged on the relief just turned back into grief. It hurts, because I always wanted to be the one she could count on, not the one she’d feel cornered by. I don't know if she's mad at me, but obviously I would rather her be alive to be mad in the first place. Hate is a fine step up from indifference anyways. But I also know this: I can’t save her. And I won’t try to fix her. That’s not love, that’s control. I just want to walk alongside her, whatever that means. I want her to feel less alone, even if it’s just knowing someone out there truly sees her and cares.

And now I'm left holding all of it. With a wife I can’t fully open up to. With friends who don’t really get it. With a son who needs my steadiness when I'm feeling anything but steady. The 72 hours ends tomorrow evening. I don't know what to expect when she gets out. Maybe she'll be angry with me, maybe still just numb. Maybe I'll never even hear from her again. I don't even know what I expect from posting this, I just needed to let other people read it, I guess.",2,1749218535.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

1l4t34l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l4t34l/aitah_for_banning_users_with_scam_links_and_other/,AITAH for banning users with scam links and other domains mostly bots use?,"Hello AITAH community!

Since our head mod began recruiting efforts a few months ago, we've expanded our moderation team and increased our toolkit to try to give you the best experience this sub can offer. Our last mod announcement was unfortunately on April 1st but we assure you our efforts are not a joke. We care about this community and want to see the quality in this community continue to improve.

Here are a few changes we've implemented over the last few months since the new team came on:

Automod: We actually use it now! We're banning social media links, scam links, amazon links, anything that can be used to monetize or self-promote has been banned. We also try to filter out those oh-so-real posts about making it big on gambling sites and we continually adjust the filter on hot topics. Nobody needs rage bait, right? Additionally we get warnings if a post or comment gets too many reports. Reports are important, this will be a theme in the post.

Rules: Rules have been refined and expounded upon. You may have noticed some comments removed for name calling or incivility. Reports from users really help us find these (theme). We have put the rules in the sidebar, the new.reddit sidebar, and the wiki. No matter how you reddit, the new rules are there, you should see them and maybe take a moment to review them. If we were to undergo anything more drastic than common sense rule changes, we will announce them in a post and sticky it.

We've also added automated tools against ban evasion, bots, karma farmers, and scammers. None of these are perfect, obviously, but they have managed to catch some of the repeat trolls, lower-quality bots, and most of the ""AITAH for looking too hot in my bikini? link to my OF here btw"" posts. If you get caught in one of these, the initial modmail should contain instructions on how to reverse it, otherwise reach out and we will investigate.

A specific note about one of these tools: it checks links in your profile and your activity on specific karma-farming subreddits. We do not police regular subreddit usage, you will never see us ban you for posting in ""normal"" subreddits such as sports, your city subreddit, or even political subs. We only ban participants in karma farming or scammer-oriented subs. We also don't ban normal social links - your FB, Insta, etc. are all fine. We ban links where people could give you money - both SFW ones like Venmo and CashApp and NSFW ones. If you need these links in your profile, you can make an alt account without the links, and we will ignore Reddit's ban evasion warnings if you let us know. We can't sort out the real enterprising users who frequent this sub from those that are owners of hundreds of bots, and we won't attempt the effort or the botfarm owners would just appeal the bans. We are not anti-sex worker or anti-entrepreneur, we are anti bots. Blame the bots or yell at us and take a perma.

Report alerts (theme): We get bat-signals for reports now. Please, please use reports appropriately and not as a super-downvote. If a comment or post gets enough reports, we at least lay eyes on them and discuss internally. We have modmail, we have a chat group. We don't only look at reported posts, but reporting them makes them much more visible to us. We've seen the shittiest ragebait barely garner 3 reports on something with 2k karma, and there will be 50 comments calling it fake. We need your reports, we use them. Please report responsibly and we'll do our part, we know mods have been less responsive in the past but our mod team has grown and so has our response team. Please report personal attacks and AI slop, we hate both. A note on the custom report feature - this can be helpful to note previous posts by OP, or a link to an old post they obviously copied from, but sometimes it is less helpful. We can mute reports from someone if they make unhelpful custom reports, and if that happens too often we will disable that feature.

These automations come with collateral damage. We get people who got hacked and had those links put in their profile. We get software devs who just leave an open hand asking for a coffee if you appreciate their efforts. We get people who mostly post in local city subs looking to pawn off their wares. We get bots. Like a lot of bots. Like holy shit a lot of them. The ban to complaint ratio is still very good but every morning the moderation team wakes up to appeals because xXSweetCherryXx, an account made 19 hours ago, can't post here any more because ""she"" has links to OF, paypal, and/or fansly (this is not a comprehensive example, it's a lot more) on her profile. If we didn't ban them then, they'd be banned in a dozen days after making some AI shitpost and then shitting up other subs spamming their AI onlyfans content.

We put these restrictions in place to allow the most common contributor to the sub to persist. The ""This is a throwaway, here is my real story"" user. We can put in account age limits, but the bots use abandoned reddit profiles, the bot owners are also patient. We can put in karma requirements, but the bots karma farm in karma farm subs or no-karma-required subs. We cannot impose limitations that do not adversely affect the real contributions to this subreddit. So instead we added the automated tools. It's the best solution we have now while leaving the door open to genuine throwaways. If the community is so sick of the fake posts that you want us to try these anyway, please let us know and we will try to implement this in a way that minimizes the collateral to real throwaways.

Our final say is the tools do more good than harm, much to the dismay of our more entrepreneurial posters who are real people. We have actually been repeatedly asked by mods of other major subreddits to implement some of these tools, since they notice the shitposters build up their karma minimums here. It is the mod team's opinion that this policy is a largely net good, but we want to remain transparent as we implement broader changes to the sub.

1l4t27k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4t27k,Every journey starts with coffee,"Hey everyone! There was such a positive response to the idea of me posting recipes and sharing my results and feedback from the Stardew Valley Cookbook, so here we go!

First off, I want to be clear: I’m not looking to help distribute recipes and pirate this book. The whole point of buying it was to support the creator—because I love Stardew. I honestly didn’t expect the recipes to actually be good… but they are.

I’m still planning to make a few actual dishes in the coming weeks, but I’ve been slammed with preparations for my pinning ceremony and am under some serious time constraints right now.

So let’s jump into the “Triple Shot Espresso.” As you’ll see, it’s not technically an espresso since it isn’t brewed under pressure. It’s more like a cold brew, but with a caffeine punch that—dare I say—outpaces espresso by a factor of three. Personally, once the weather warms up here in the PNW, I switch from hot coffee to cold brew. Right now, it’s just warm enough I’ve had to turn on the AC—so this hits the spot. It’s easily the strongest cold brew I’ve ever made.

The spice mix includes cinnamon sticks, green cardamom, and clove. I used organic, single-origin Mexican coffee beans from Oaxaca and ground them on the coarsest setting of my Timemore. I ended up using nearly a pound of beans to make a triple batch of this recipe.

To grind the spices, I used my KitchenAid mixer, though next time I might try the food processor instead—there wasn’t quite enough volume to get them moving properly, so I had to bunch them together to get any action. The only change I made from the recipe was letting the extraction sit on the counter for 24 hours instead of refrigerating it. In my experience, refrigerating during extraction weakens the flavor. That said, there may be food safety reasons behind the book’s recommendation to brew it cold.

Flavor-wise, I get why this recipe is listed in the winter section of the book, even though coffee is technically a spring/summer crop. The spice blend has a distinctly wintery feel—but not so much that it feels out of place in summer. The interplay of spices gives the impression of a light orange citrus note. It’s not bitter at all—dangerously smooth, in fact. Now I understand why my farmer in-game dedicates an entire inventory slot to this stuff and downs a cup every four minutes.

The potency is no joke. This is a concentrate, so I’d recommend drinking it like a proper espresso, diluting it into an Americano, or using it as a base for a latte. I really like that the cookbook mentions you can warm it up—just not to boiling—so you don’t extract any harshness. I might try it again in winter or even use it as a shortcut to batch affogato since my little manual espresso machine can only pull one shot at a time.

If you want to see my espresso credentials, check my post history—right before this, I shared my setup. Safe to say, I’m a fan of making my own espresso.

Oh—and one last thing. I always wondered how in Stardew Valley the triple shot espresso was made in a barrel. Now that I know it’s a cold brew? It actually makes sense.",6,1749218197.0,StardewValley,0,1.0,False

We can overly focus on the technical aspects of the bikes, something I think many of us are guilty of, but something happened to me this week which made me think about what a great product every Brompton is, regardless of which model you have.

I was cycling through central London, something I've done on a regular basis for the last 35 years or so, and the last ten on a Brompton. Cycling along during the rush hour, in the zone, checking the traffic around me, thinking about maybe getting a coffee round the corner from my office, when a lady ran out from the pavement right into my path. There was a bus behind me, I had no time so pulled my brakes on as hard as I could in the split second I had to react. I have an electric Brompton, so have always thought in such a situation, with all the weight up front, I would go over the handlebars and... no. I didn't. The brakes worked very well, my rear wheel started to skid, but I I kept control and managed to stop just before I hit this woman, who I think was a tourist. She apologised and continued her run. I caught my breath, and a fellow cyclist behind me said 'Great save!'.

I paused for a second and resumed my commute. An everyday occurrence maybe, but not for me. I've never had to brake like that on a Brompton in years. But the bike behaved predictably and controllably in what might otherwise have been a nasty collision for both rider and pedestrian. I think that intuitive balance you feel on the Brompton, with the stretched out frame and distance between the wheels is what helps here. Just the fundamental engineering of the frame, weight down low, solid frame, responsive brakes etc etc Whatever it is, all that stuff about comfort and ride ability yes, we all know that, but also, that means at moments like this, the bike does what you expect it to, as your animal brain is trying to calculate in split second timing how to stop two humans going splat on a bust road.

So, yes, no big drama to report. No amazing bike upgrade to share photos about. No amazing adventure undertaken. Just an everyday commute story. But just to say these bikes continue to delight, but also reward you in ways you may not even be aware of.

Safe cycling everyone, whatever you're up to!",5,1749218114.0,Brompton,0,1.0,False
1l4t0wx,https://www.reddit.com/r/theEichlerChronicles/comments/1l4t0wx/winnies_journey_to_paris/,Winnie's Journey to Paris,"Winnie’s parents died suddenly in a tragic car accident, and she is being sent to live with her mysterious Aunt Delores, who lives in Paris near the Eiffel Tower. On the journey to France, her aunt’s assistant, Augustus, tells her many wondrous tales about her aunt and her adventures with her sister Angela, Winnie’s mother!

**Winnie's Journey to Paris**

https://preview.redd.it/ukkw7bgyab5f1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b522d840a297f21b9dc25a78d9a50b34f7b834c4

The rain drummed against the airplane window as eleven-year-old Winnie pressed her face to the cool glass, watching England disappear beneath a blanket of clouds. Everything felt surreal—just three days ago, she'd been complaining about her mother's overprotective rules and her father's terrible jokes at the breakfast table. Now they were gone, lost in an instant when a drunk driver ran a red light on their way home from date night.

Across the aisle, Augustus Pemberton adjusted his wire-rimmed spectacles and cleared his throat gently. He was a peculiar man—tall and thin as a lamppost, with silver hair that seemed to have a mind of its own and eyes that twinkled with secrets. When he'd appeared at the funeral in his perfectly pressed navy suit, introducing himself as Aunt Delores's assistant, Winnie had barely registered his presence through her fog of grief.

""Miss Winnie,"" Augustus said in his crisp British accent, ""might I tell you a story to pass the time?""

Winnie shrugged without turning from the window. She'd heard enough stories lately—stories about how everything would be okay, how her parents were in a better place, how she was going to love living with her mysterious aunt in Paris. None of them felt true.

But Augustus began anyway, his voice taking on a storyteller's cadence that somehow made the airplane cabin feel less cold and sterile.

""Your Aunt Delores wasn't always the woman she is today,"" he said. ""Once upon a time, she and your mother Angela were just two adventurous sisters from a small town in Yorkshire, dreaming of seeing the world beyond their garden gate.""

Despite herself, Winnie found her attention caught. Her mother had rarely spoken of her childhood, and never mentioned having adventures.

""Angela was the careful one,"" Augustus continued, ""always planning, always thinking three steps ahead. But Delores? She was pure impulse and wild imagination. When they were sixteen and fourteen, they found an old map in their grandmother's attic—a map that showed a hidden garden in the heart of Paris, marked with symbols they couldn't decipher.""

Winnie finally turned from the window. ""My mother went to Paris when she was sixteen?""

Augustus smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. ""Oh, my dear girl, your mother didn't just go to Paris—she and Delores ran away to Paris. They spent their last pounds on ferry tickets, lived on bread and cheese for a week, and searched every arrondissement for that mysterious garden.""

""Did they find it?""

""They found something far more extraordinary. In a forgotten courtyard behind Notre-Dame, they discovered not a garden, but an old woman named Madame Beaumont who claimed to be a keeper of stories. She told them that some people are born to collect adventures the way others collect stamps, and that the two sisters had the spark of true adventurers in their eyes.""

Winnie leaned forward despite herself. ""What happened then?""

""Madame Beaumont offered them a choice,"" Augustus said, his voice dropping to a whisper. ""They could return home and live ordinary lives, or they could stay and learn the art of finding magic in the everyday world. Your mother chose to go home—she was worried about your grandparents, you see. But Delores... Delores chose to stay.""

The plane hit a patch of turbulence, and Winnie gripped her armrest. ""Is that why I've never met Aunt Delores?""

""Partly,"" Augustus said gently. ""Your mother and aunt had what you might call a philosophical disagreement. Angela believed in building a safe, stable life. She wanted to protect the people she loved from uncertainty and danger. Delores believed in embracing the unknown, in teaching people to find their strength through adventure.""

""They fought about it?""

""They fought about you."" Augustus's voice was soft with old sadness. ""When you were born, Delores wanted to be part of your life. She wanted to teach you languages and take you on travels, to show you that the world was vast and full of wonders. But your mother feared that Delores would fill your head with dangerous dreams.""

Winnie felt tears prick her eyes. ""So my mother kept me away from her sister?""

""Your mother loved you so much that she was willing to sacrifice her relationship with Delores to keep you safe,"" Augustus said. ""And Delores loved you both so much that she respected Angela's wishes, even though it broke her heart.""

As the plane began its descent into Charles de Gaulle Airport, Augustus reached into his leather satchel and pulled out a small, leather-bound journal tied with a faded blue ribbon.

""This belonged to your mother,"" he said, placing it gently in Winnie's hands. ""She kept it during those two weeks in Paris with Delores. Your aunt has been saving it for you.""

Winnie untied the ribbon with trembling fingers and opened to the first page. In her mother's careful handwriting, she read:

\*""Day 1 in Paris: Delores says we're going to have the adventure of a lifetime. I'm terrified and exhilarated and homesick all at once. But looking at this city spread out before us, I think I'm beginning to understand what she means about magic hiding in plain sight.""\*

""Your Aunt Delores has been waiting twelve years to meet you properly,"" Augustus said as the plane touched down with a gentle bump. ""She lives in a peculiar apartment on the seventh floor of a building that shouldn't be able to fit seven floors, just a stone's throw from the Eiffel Tower. She speaks four languages, keeps a garden on her roof where she grows impossible flowers, and she's been collecting stories about your mother's daughter—about you—from anyone who's ever met you.""

Winnie looked up from the journal, her eyes wide. ""She's been watching me?""

""She's been loving you from a distance,"" Augustus corrected gently. ""And now, if you'll let her, she'd very much like to love you up close. She wants to teach you to make proper hot chocolate, to show you how to find secret passages in old buildings, and to help you discover what kind of adventures your own heart is calling you toward.""

As they gathered their belongings and prepared to disembark, Winnie clutched her mother's journal to her chest. The grief was still there, sharp and heavy in her chest, but for the first time in days, she felt something else too—a tiny flutter of curiosity, a whisper of possibility.

""Augustus?"" she said as they walked up the jet bridge.

""Yes, Miss Winnie?"" ""Do you think... do you think my mother would have wanted me to go on adventures with Aunt Delores?""

Augustus paused and looked down at her with infinite kindness. ""I think your mother spent her whole life protecting you so that when the time came, you'd be strong enough to choose your adventures. And I think she'd be very proud to see you being brave enough to start your first one.""

As they emerged into the bustling Paris airport, with its announcements in rapid French and the scent of coffee and pastries in the air, Winnie took a deep breath. Somewhere in this city was a woman who had loved her from afar, who kept impossible flowers in a rooftop garden, and who had stories about a sister she'd lost and found and lost again.

It wasn't the life Winnie had planned. But as Augustus had said, perhaps it was time to discover what kind of adventures her heart was calling her toward. The journey to her new life was beginning.",1,1749218100.0,theEichlerChronicles,0,1.0,False

There are like a million different ways to structure story. You've got the Hero's Journey (you know it: reluctant chosen one, vague prophecy, dead parents because we can't have nice things). Think Star Wars. Think Love Between Fairy and Devil. Yes, that show is literally a celestial Hero's Journey wrapped in angst, body swaps, and enough emotional constipation to supply a pharmacy.

You also have Three-Act Structure, Save the Cat, whatever. honestly doesn't matter what model you use because one thing's universal:

 

The hook.

It's like a venus flytrap but for your attention span. Pretty, innocent-looking, then SNAP. You're mine now. Probably gonna drag you through 40 episodes of pure suffering only to get a five-minute ""happily ever after... probably"" montage that answers exactly zero questions.

It's the ML somehow finding the FL during a crowded lantern festival and not being able to look away (Love Like the Galaxy). Okay you could argue that the hook was when she pointed that dainty wrist out of the carriage. That could qualify as a hook BUT the lantern moment is more character-defining for both of them so maybe that's the better hook. Fight me. I have caffeine and very strong opinions about fictional people and their life choices.

It's the seal on a 30,000-year-old prison being broken and our FL getting vacuum-sucked into magical hell (Love Between Fairy and Devil). Side note: why is it always magical prisons? Can't we trap demons in like, I don't know, a really annoying bureaucracy or something?

It's that arrow slicing through the darkness to impale two rather attractive innocents (Blossom). I'm still not over this one. Thanks for asking. It's been months and I still think about it when I'm trying to sleep. Which is probably not healthy but here we are.

Without a good hook? You scroll. You drop. You forget. Your attention span does that thing where it just... *poof*. Gone. Like my motivation to fold laundry or put on a bra.

The hook is everything.

It's the first hit of whatever keeps you watching, the beginning of the spiral, the reason you're still watching at 2AM whispering ""just one more episode"" while your sleep schedule cries in the corner and your responsibilities pile up like dirty dishes.

Now let's break down what makes a hook work, why some flop like a soggy dumpling at a fancy dinner party, and how good shows use that hook to completely wreck your productivity.

 

What Even IS a Hook Though?

The hook is bait. Evil bait. It's what snags your attention and whispers, ""Stick around, drama's about to get MESSY."" Usually shows up in the first few minutes of an episode, the opening moments of an arc, or the initial premise that makes you click ""play"" instead of doing literally anything useful with your life. Like laundry. My waist high pile is giving me the side eye.

And here's the thing! In novels you get ONE hook. One chance. Mess it up and you're done. But in these long-form dramas? You get THREE different chances to destroy someone's evening plans!

 

**The Series Hook** \- why am I watching this show at all

**The Arc Hook** \- mini-crisis time  
**The Episode Hook** – don't you dare click away

 

In Sword and Brocade, the series hook is when she agrees to marry into a family so cold they probably have icicles for feelings, not for love (ew, gross), but to uncover the truth behind her mother's death. That's not just drama, that's revenge in silk and embroidery and I am HERE for it. Plus the costumes are gorgeous which doesn't hurt. Plus Wallace Chung. Plus Tan Song… need I say more?

For arc hooks... okay so in what I call the ""boat arc"" of Under the Power (super creative naming, I know), it's our FL being falsely accused of stealing birthday treasures. That kicks off this whole mess of like 6 episodes. Though personally? I was hooked the second our emotionally constipated ML caught that arrow with his BARE HANDS. Like, who DOES that? Still thinking about it. My brain won't let it go and I've tried.

Episode hooks are those little moments that grab you in the first few minutes and go ""don't you DARE click out."" Could be a dramatic slap, a secret letter, or—and this is my weakness—an emotionally constipated ML giving the FL a hairpin like he's presenting the freaking crown jewels.

These keep the energy up and remind you why you're obsessed instead of having a normal relationship with television where you watch things once and move on like a functioning adult.

What Makes a Hook Actually Good?

Okay so it's not just throwing drama at the wall and hoping something sticks. Though sometimes that works too!

A hook has to matter. It should tell you something crucial about the characters (preferably something that makes you go ""oh NO"" out loud and concern your neighbors). Or tilt the story's world sideways. Or drop a threat so good you physically cannot look away even though you know it's going to hurt.

A hook that works isn't just pretty drama. It's like a promise! Wrapped in good cinematography and probably some really dramatic lighting. It sets the emotional tone, gives you stakes that actually hurt, and shows you who these characters really are when everything goes sideways and their carefully constructed lives fall apart.

A good hook forces change.

Tips the world just enough that nothing can go back to how it was. It's not just a carriage crash or an ambush in the rain (though I do love a good ambush in the rain, very atmospheric). It's a shift in everything.

And if you're doing it right? That moment echoes through the rest of the story like that song that gets stuck in your head for three weeks.

A vow made in desperation, a secret that changes everything, a hand deliberately not held when it should have been. The kind of moment that makes you pause the show and just sit there for a minute.

If your hook doesn't trigger momentum or character growth or a question that keeps people awake at night wondering ""but what happens NEXT""... then it's just expensive noise with pretty lighting. And there's enough of that already.

A prince storming into a brothel? Sure, dramatic entrance, very cinematic. But if he's not internally falling apart while doing it, what's the point? We need the emotional mess, not just the pretty action sequence.

A noble lady accused of theft? Great! But ONLY if it leads to serious fallout and maybe a candlelit interrogation that's basically foreplay with more clothes on. Otherwise it's just background noise while I'm thinking about whether I have enough milk for coffee tomorrow. Which reminds me, I definitely don't have enough milk.

A good hook doesn't scream ""LOOK AT ME!"" like an annoying person at a party.

It whispers ""you're not sleeping tonight"" and then proves it.

 

Not All Hooks Are Big and Loud

Sometimes it's not a sword fight or dramatic slap that gets you. Sometimes the quiet moments are the ones that absolutely wreck you.

Sometimes it's one glance across a courtyard that lasts exactly 2.5 seconds too long and you KNOW something just shifted. One teacup dropped with shaking fingers—the SOUND of that teacup hitting the floor, oh my god, why is it always the teacups that destroy me? One tired ""you've changed"" delivered like a knife between the ribs.

Those quiet moments? They wreck you worse than any explosion. Because now I'm thinking about them while brushing my teeth at 7am, analyzing the cinematography of a TEACUP while my coffee gets cold and I'm late for everything and my brain just won't let it go.

That's the real power right there.

Pacing Matters

A killer hook is great, but if the next six episodes are just everyone standing around in different rooms recapping the same plot points while wearing slightly different outfits... you've broken the trust. I didn't sign up for philosophical tea parties where people explain things I already figured out three episodes ago. I came for scandal and longing stares that could power a small city.

You can't drop an emotional bomb in episode one then serve me exposition soup for a week. Keep the energy. Keep the promise. Give me something to chew on.

Actually, can we talk about shows that do this? Because it's SO frustrating when they hook you with something amazing and then just... forget about it? Like they used up all their good ideas in the first episode and then had to figure out how to fill 39 more episodes.

 

My Favorite Hooks (The Ones That Completely Ruined My Life)

**Imperial Coroner:** A girl doing street investigation like she's solving murders for fun. Immediately sold. No questions asked.

**Be My Princess:** Memory-wiping car crash? I'm so there it's embarrassing. Hook (see what I did there! LOL), line, and sinker.

**My Dear Guardian:** Gunfight in what looked like a cathedral but probably wasn't but the aesthetic was so pretty I didn't care. Just take my emotional stability and go.

 

 If you want to hear me ramble about story structure more, let me know! If it's crickets I'll assume I'm the weird one yelling about hooks into the void while everyone else has normal hobbies like gardening or whatever. If you actually want more of this nonsense then maybe we'll do inciting incidents next! Are you excited? I'm excited. But I always get excited about story stuff, it's a character flaw.

What are your favorite hooks? What moments grabbed you by the throat and refused to let go until you'd watched everything and were emotionally devastated? I need to know I'm not alone in this beautiful obsession with fictional people and their terrible life choices.

From the top floor of the Black Oak Oil building, he could practically see all the way to Fort Worth. He knew the view well. The same buildings and trees, the same smog......","Chapter One  
  
  Gavin James put down his coffee and looked out over the Dallas skyline. From the top floor of the Black Oak Oil building, he could practically see all the way to Fort Worth. He knew the view well. The same buildings and trees, the same smog hanging over the same traffic jam this time of morning. Even the coffee was the same, just like every other morning. He rose long before the sun, nightmares chasing away any semblance of peaceful sleep. He always gave up and, after a punishing run, came in to the office. His employees thought he was dedicated, but the truth was he had nothing better to do.  
  
  His only reason for smiling anymore was the one person he must stay far, far away from.  
  
  Hannah Craig.  
  
  Yeah, you did such a great job staying way far away from her, you idiot. You hired her as your admin. Way to keep the girl safe. She’s a whole twenty feet away from you eight plus hours a day. Good going, James.  
  
  The phone ringing on his desk interrupted his nasty inner monologue.  
  
  “Hey, bro, I’m going to be a little bit late.” Gavin’s brother Slade yawned as he spoke.  
  
  “What a surprise. Another late night at the club?”  
  
  Maybe Hannah wasn’t the only one who made Gavin smile. He couldn’t help the way his lips quirked up, thinking about how his brother spent his nights. Spanking women was rapidly becoming a second job for Slade—and he was good at it. Often, Gavin wondered why he didn’t go out with his brothers. Maybe not to the BDSM club they frequented, but dinner would be nice. He’d become so solitary in the last ten years since—  
  
  Nope. He refused to think about that.  
  
  Gavin forced a cheery tone to his voice. “Did Dex keep you out all night?”  
  
  “I did not keep him out,” Dex said as he strolled into the office, proving once again that he was always on time. Of course, he also was the illegitimate child who felt the need to prove he belonged. “Slade managed that all on his own. He found a pretty blonde. Surprise, surprise.  
  
  When I left the club they were getting mighty cozy.”  
  
  Gavin’s brief foray into a decent mood took a nosedive. Slade would have picked a pretty blonde for one reason and one reason only—to pretend she was Hannah. Of all of Gavin’s many reasons for staying the hell away from his admin, the fact that both of his brothers were crazy about her sat at the top of his list.  
  
  Who are you fooling? That’s not why you stay away. If you don’t, you know what will happen. You know what you’d do to that girl. You already lost one. Do you really think you deserve a second chance?  
  
  Gavin took a deep breath and forced a smile. Dex already believed that he was indifferent.  
  
  He didn’t want to push his half brother even further away.  
  
  Punching the button on the phone, Gavin put Slade on speaker. “Tell me you’re going to make the board meeting.”  
  
  Dex snorted and tossed his big body into one of the chairs in front of Gavin’s desk. He crossed one leg over the other, his beat-up cowboy boots poking from his tailored suit. That was Dex. Gavin could force him into a designer suit, but he was never going to lose the cowboy.  
  
  “Of course I’m going to make the meeting,” Slade said with a long-suffering sigh. “I’m not late because I partied too hard. I just talked to the blonde. Mostly. Candy? Sandy? I don’t remember. She was nice, but she wasn’t…”  
  
  Hannah. Gavin watched Dex’s mouth turn down. He was obviously thinking the same thing.  
  
  Slade continued. “It doesn’t matter. Listen, I got a call about the Alaska site. We’ve had a little trouble there. Something’s gone wrong with the infrastructure. I’m going to have to head up there for a few days. I spent the morning calling around to make sure the house is ready for me after the board disperses.”  
  
  Gavin arched a brow at Dex, who waved him off. “It’s an engineering problem, not security.  
  
  I already talked to Mike in River Run. He said it’s been really quiet there. The worst they’ve had is some kids deciding the base office needs new graffiti on the side. They have computer problems, too, but the IT guy is on it. The situation Slade is talking about just needs a little follow-up and supervision.”  
  
  Well, at least security was one thing he didn’t worry about. Since Dex had taken it over for Black Oak Oil, that function had been running smoothly.  
  
  Gavin grabbed the stack of mail he’d taken from Hannah’s desk, waiting for her arrival in thirty-four minutes. God, he was an idiot. He knew the exact time she would walk in the door, and he waited on her like a dog waiting for a promised treat. Anxiously, he sorted through the mail. It was too early to expect anyone else to be in for meetings, and he had nothing else to do.  
  
  She was far too efficient. He’d hired her straight off the bus from some no-name West Texas town, never imagining how quickly she would become essential. Sometimes, Gavin even found himself twiddling his damn thumbs because Hannah ran his workload so efficiently.  
  
  There was a slight pause on Slade’s end of the line, and then his brother sounded almost reluctant. “Gavin, Dex and I want to talk to you about something. Do you think we could schedule lunch after the meeting?”  
  
  The mail was all crap. He could throw most of it away. He came to a large envelope that looked more interesting. Maybe it contained something other than an offer to halve his budget for bulk paper. Gavin sliced his letter opener neatly through the material as suspicion about this luncheon crept into his mind. “About what? Business?”  
  
  Dex shifted in his chair. “Not exactly.”  
  
  Fuck. He didn’t want to do this with them. “Is this about Hannah?” Why had he even asked? He knew. His brothers had been sniffing around her since the day Gavin had reluctantly hired her almost a year ago. Somehow, they’d zeroed in on the fact that he wanted her, as well.  
  
  “What we want isn’t going to change, Gavin,” Dex said, his mouth a stubborn, flat line. “No matter how much you want it to.”  
  
  “She’s an adult.” Slade’s voice was cajoling where Dex went straight to the fight. “She’s smart and capable of making her own decisions. She’ll be fine.”  
  
  “She’s what? Twenty-two or something.” Practically a child. At least h  
e kept telling himself that.  
  
  Dex leaned forward as if ready to fight if need be. “Gavin, you were running this company at twenty-two, don’t forget. Besides, Hannah is twenty-five.”  
  
  A chill raced across Gavin’s skin, and suddenly the room seemed way too small. Hannah was twenty-five. They had just celebrated her birthday not a month before. He’d brought in a cake, and Dex and Slade had thrown her a party. Gavin remembered the jealousy he’d felt as his brothers had led her out of the office. He’d wanted to be there beside her, too, celebrating with Hannah. Holding her.  
  
  “If you’re being at all honest with yourself, Gavin, you want what we want. Hannah is not Nikki, and you’re not the same person you were then. You have to let it go and live again,” Slade said. “I’ll be there in ten minutes. We’ll talk more then.”  
  
  “Regardless of her actual age, she’s naïve. She’s not ready to take on multiple men or play your games.” Gavin was pleased with how stable his voice sounded when all he could see in his mind’s eye was Nikki’s body laid out on the impersonal slab at the morgue.  
  
  Lately in his dreams, Nikki’s body turned into Hannah’s. The image seared itself in his head.  
  
  He managed to breathe, barely. He had to focus or he would lose it. And he needed to find another job for Hannah. If he kept her this close… No, he just couldn’t.  
  
  “Damn it, Gavin,” Slade growled. “When it comes to Hannah, these aren’t games, and we’re not playing.”  
  
  Gavin’s heart stuttered. “Give the girl time to grow up.”  
  
  He upended the large envelope in his hand and let the contents drift to his desk, hoping Dex didn’t notice his shaking hands.  
  
  “Don’t act like it’s all just Slade and me. You’re not fooling anyone,” Dex said. For once, the big cowboy almost looked reluctant to speak. “I see how you look at her. You want her. You care. That’s nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, if there’s one thing both Slade and I understand, it’s how a man can be crazy about Hannah.”  
  
  Slade’s voice came over the speaker. “Dex and I have given this a lot of thought. We think it’s time, and all of us need to be on board.”  
  
  “Exactly.” Dex leaned forward. “We have a plan.”  
  
  “What the fuck?” Anything else they were about to say got lost as Gavin saw what spilled out of the envelope. Photographs of Hannah. He frowned. Ten pictures, all of them of her gorgeous body wearing lovely, lacy creations in soft colors that showcased her plump breasts and gorgeous ass. In one, a shot of her backside, she wore nothing at all. Gavin’s breath fled, and his cock stiffened at the sight.  
  
  Dex stood, peering down at the pictures on the desk. “What’s that?” Gavin had a sudden desire to hide the provocative images. Instead, he glared. At times, Dex had been known to think way outside the box when he solved a problem. Dex had said he a plan.  
  
  Was taking these pictures a part of it? Or Dex’s immature way of reeling him into their twisted little arrangement?  
  
  “Do you want to explain this?” He shoved the least seductive image in Dex’s face.  
  
  “That’s Hannah. What the hell?” Dex grabbed the picture.  
  
  “What’s going on?” Slade asked, his voice rising in alarm over the phone. “What do you mean by ‘that’s Hannah?’”  
  
  Dex stared at Gavin, his face taking on that same blank expression he’d had for the first two years after Gavin and Slade had found him in a foster home. Dex had been the child their father hadn’t planned on or wanted. It had been pure chance that Gavin and Slade even discovered that Dex existed. “You think I would do this?”  
  
  His half brother’s indignant tone registered in Gavin’s head, but rage rode him hard. “Do you know what Hannah could do to you if she found out about this? She could call in the cops, and I would let her. And your sick ploy won’t work. You might be able to pull Slade into your perversions, but don’t think you can do the same with me.”  
  
  “Goddamn it, Gavin. Why would you say that?” Slade slammed a door, and Gavin knew that his brother was on his way.  
  
  Dex practically radiated fury. He was a huge bull of a man, and Gavin thought they were about to have the throw down he’d always suspected was coming. Dex loomed over Gavin, his fists clenched and ready, but then he shut down. Dex’s shoulders relaxed, and his face became a mask of bland politeness. “Listen up, Gavin. The only reason I am not walking out the door right this second is that I want Hannah safe. After I figure out who’s stalking her and make sure he can’t do it again, I’m leaving. You won’t have to deal with this perverse bastard ever again. But next time your rich-boy conscience takes over, don’t you dare come looking for me.” Gavin looked at the pictures again and realized he’d made several terrible errors. He’d been so concerned about the photos that he hadn’t taken time to really look at the envelope. It hadn’t been addressed to him, but to Hannah herself. There was no stamp on the front. Some bastard had walked right into her office, stood at her desk, and made sure she would receive his “gift”.  
  
  Dex flipped over one of the photographs and slapped it on Gavin’s desk with a resounding thud.  
  
  You’re mine.  
  
  The menacing words had been written in blood-red marker, the color a stark contrast to the white of the photo paper.  
  
  “This is not some prank I cooked up to trick you into joining us. You’re really accusing me of becoming a stalker and trying to terrify the woman I love? And yes, I love Hannah. I won’t not say it because you’re too much of a pussy to handle it. I’m going to figure out what’s going on, and when I leave, I intend to take her with me. And you, big brother, can go to hell for all I care.” Dex turned on his boots and strode out the door.  
  
  Gavin tried to stop the queasy feeling in his stomach as everything Dex had said sank in.  
  
  “What the hell did you do, Gavin?” Slade asked, his voice barely audible over the sounds of traffic.  
  
  Gavin bit back the urge to put his head in his hands. He’d utterly mishandled everything. But that was the story of his whole fucking life. “Get your ass up here now, Slade.” He hung up the phone and couldn’t help but stare at the pictures in front of him. Hannah was in her bedroom, and the pictures were obviously taken from a distance. They had a grainy quality. In most, Hannah was reading or watching television in her tiny bedroom. She wore a nightgown in two of the pictures, but the majority featured her in a lacy bra and barely-there panties. So fucking gorgeous. She hid that body under nearly shapeless clothes and always kept her hair in a ponytail. In the pictures, her rich honey hair flowed down her shoulders in loose curls.  
  
  He loved the one where she leaned back on the bed, the phone in her hand and a smile on her face, like she was laughing. Her green eyes were bright, and that smile could light up the whole fucking world. The clock by her bed read ten o’clock. Gavin remembered calling Hannah at just around that time a few nights before. He’d lost an important phone number. She’d teased him about his organizational skills.  
  
  This was how she looked when she talked to him? Half-dressed, plump lips welcoming?  
  
  Fuck, he’d explode next time he had to call her at home.  
  
  Gavin flipped the photo over.  
  
  Don’t let those perverted brothers touch you. You’re mine.  
  
  Gavin shoved the photo aside and surged to his feet. Hannah was in danger, and he’d been getting a hard-on looking at evidence. What kind of man was he?  
  
  You know, that voice said. You know exactly what kind of man you are, asshole.  
  
  He was a man who had just shoved his half brother aside in one of the cruelest ways possible.  
  
  He shoved everyone away. Now, he was going to lose everything if he didn’t get his shit straight.  
  
  Not this time. By damned, he was going to make things right.  
  
  Gavin paced as he waited for Slade, a plan already forming.  
  
  \* \* \* \*  
  
  Hannah Craig stopped and stared as Dex Townsend walked out of Gavin’s office and into the grand reception area she liked to consider her turf. Walked? Dex never walked. He strode. He swaggered  
. And now he charged out of the office like an angry bull.  
  
  She inched back into the hallway to observe him. She’d discovered that all of her men tended to put on a front when they realized she was in the room.  
  
  Her men. It was all she could do not to laugh at herself, but that was the way she thought of the James Gang—Gavin, Slade, and Dex. In her fantasies, they were her men, though she would never, ever tell them. But she’d fallen madly in love with them, and all three were way out of her league.  
  
  Now one of her men walked straight up to the wall across from her desk and scrubbed an angry hand across his head. He looked back at the door to Gavin’s office as though he wanted to march back in and give his oldest brother a piece of his mind. Something definitely had Dex in a state. His handsome face was a mottled red and yet…she swore she saw a slight sheen of tears in his eyes. With a little huff, he pulled back his fist and put it straight through the wall. The drywall gave without a fuss, merely cracking and sending up a little cloud of dust. Dex yanked on his hand to pull it free.  
  
  It was time to bring that man down from whatever had him so mad or he’d start in on the furniture.  
  
  “I never did like that wall,” Hannah said softly.  
  
  Dex turned, shock obvious on his face. His angry, red flush muted to an embarrassed pink.  
  
  “Hannah. I didn’t know you were here.”  
  
  She smiled at him and walked in as though nothing at all was wrong. Life was what a person made it, her Gran had always said. It was time to make Dex’s life a bit calmer. “I mean it. I’m glad someone finally put that arrogant wall in its place. I’ve slapped at it a couple of times, but it always just stands there.”  
  
  He huffed a little laugh. “You’re crazy, girl. You know that, right?” The tension in Dex dialed down several notches.  
  
  “I have no idea what you mean. And you’re one to talk. I’m not the one taking out my frustrations on a wall.

She set her purse down and looked around for the mail. Nothing. Gavin probably had it. She was going to have to have a discussion with the man about his priorities. A CEO looking at the mail. Hannah sighed. If she let him, he would make the coffee, too. Gavin James was a micromanager. She opened her calendar to get ready for the day ahead.  
  
  “Hannah, I’m sorry.”  
  
  When she looked up, Dex was in front of her desk, six foot five inches of the hottest cowboy she’d ever seen forced into a business suit. Dex had the broadest shoulders and the deepest chest, but what got her every time was how often he showed off his big heart. He tried to hide it, but she knew he’d helped out more than one employee with money troubles or medical bills.  
  
  If she told him what was happening to her, he would move heaven and earth to fix the problem. More than once, the information had been right there on the tip of her tongue, but she held back. Dex had his own troubles, and she could handle hers. She was an independent, strong woman who wasn’t going to panic because some idiot sent her a few letters. And called a couple of times. And had potentially killed her cat.  
  
  She forced a smile on her face. “You didn’t hit me, big guy, so no apologies. Do you want to tell me what’s going on with Gavin that has you feeling violent?” She didn’t want to bring him into her trouble, but she couldn’t stay out of his. Dex and Gavin had a difficult relationship, to say the least. Slade was the bridge between the two, but he wasn’t here, so it was up to her.  
  
  Dex took a long breath and then that “aw shucks” smile was back on his handsome face. “It’s nothing, darlin’. Just a small difference of opinion. Put it out of your mind.” She looked over at the hole in the wall.  
  
  He flushed again. “I’ll have that fixed.”  
  
  The outer doors crashed open, and Slade rushed in. He was one disheveled hunk of male hotness. His dress shirt hung together by one small button at the hips. The rest fell open, exposing his hard pectorals and giving her a breathtaking glimpse of his ridged abdomen. She damn near swallowed her tongue. His inky hair sat slightly askew. And he looked rattled.  
  
  Hannah managed to smile without panting. “You are going to be a big hit in the board meeting.”  
  
  He looked down at his clothes as though it was the first time he’d given it a thought. “I was in a hurry. Hannah, are you all right?”  
  
  “Fine.”  
  
  She picked up the phone, knowing exactly what he needed. This wasn’t her first rodeo, as the folks back in Two Trees liked to say. “Wendy, you have a code blue.” Wendy, Slade’s admin, sighed. “Which part do I need to replace? Tie? Socks? That man is constantly wearing athletic socks with his dress shoes.”  
  
  Hannah looked Slade up and down. He knew the drill, turning in a circle for her inspection.  
  
  “Nope, Wendy. This is a head-to-toe fixer-upper.”  
  
  She hung up the phone just as Slade got a look at her wall. He stared at it a moment before glaring at Dex.  
  
  “Seriously? Please tell me that wasn’t Gavin’s head. Where’s his body? Do I need to call 911?” Slade asked the questions with a sarcastic edge, but Hannah heard his concern.  
  
  Dex simply shook his head. “No trouble at all. I’m going to call maintenance and get them up here to fix this. Then I have a few things to do. I think I’ll skip the meeting.”  
  
  “You can’t skip the board meeting.”  
  
  Dex shrugged as he moved toward the door. “Watch me. I have more important things to do.  
  
  And Hannah, you’re having lunch today with me and Slade.”  
  
  She glanced down at her calendar. “I can’t. I agreed to have lunch with Scott.”  
  
  “Who the hell is Scott?” Slade demanded.  
  
  “He works with the IT teams. He said it was important,” Hannah explained. “I’m sure it has something to do with those installs I’ve been helping to coordinate.” Both men went very still.  
  
  “You’re not meeting Scott anymore. You’re having lunch with us, and we’re going to have a long talk, the three of us.” Dex’s dark eyes held hers for a moment. He was so serious that her heart started racing. When his voice got deep and dark, it made her blood pound.  
  
  “Absolutely.” Slade crossed his arms over his chest.  
  
  “Okay,” she said. She hadn’t sounded that breathy, had she?  
  
  Dex walked out, the doors slamming behind him. Slade shook his head. Even disheveled, he was a gorgeous sight. With thick, dark hair and a face that looked like Michelangelo sculpted it, Slade always made her sigh.  
  
  Gavin opened his door and stepped out. He radiated power. Unlike Slade and Dex, there was nothing less than perfect about his appearance. No suit would ever dare to wrinkle while Gavin James wore it.  
  
  He nodded grimly at her. “Good morning, Hannah. I need to talk to Slade, but I would like you to stay close to your desk this morning.”  
  
  “Of course.” It was an odd request, but one she could handle.  
  
  Slade disappeared into his brother’s office. Gavin closed the door, watching her intently until it shut between them with an ominous thud.  
  
  And then Hannah was alone.  
  
  She reached into her purse and pulled out the number for the private investigator she’d hired two days before. He’d cashed her check but hadn’t returned her calls. Maybe it was time to admit that hiring someone named Vinny who worked out of the back of a tarot reader’s shop hadn’t been the greatest idea. When he didn’t answer, she left another message while e-mailing Scott to cancel lunch. After that, she called the local animal shelters to check if they’d found Mr.  
  
  Snuggles. Her cat had been gone for days, and Hannah was beginning to fear that she was gone forever.  
  
  Her eyes teared up. She was going to have to take action and soon. She felt alone now that her three men were gone. It was a long time until her lunch with Dex and Slade. The office seemed big and empty. She wanted so much to call them back and tell them her trouble.  
  
  But why tell the busy men she loved—who couldn’t possibly love her in return—that someone was trying to kill her?  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  Slade’s blood pressure rose as he looked down at the photographs in front of him. From listening to Dex and Gavin on the phone, he’d figured out that someone was stalking Hannah, but seeing the sick evidence in front of him was staggering.  
  
  Gavin walked around his desk and sank into the huge wingback chair their father had sat in for forty years. Slade would have burned the big reminder of the son of a bitch, but Gavin had kept it, even after he’d completely redecorated the office.  
  
  “They were addressed directly to Hannah,” Gavin said, his voice clipped. “No return address.  
  
  No postage.”  
  
  “So this asshole brought the envelope into the building? It has to be an employee. No one can get past reception without a keycard.”  
  
  Gavin went pale. Then he flushed with fury. “Goddamn it.”  
  
  “Have you looked through the security tapes?” Slade picked up a photo of Hannah lying on her stomach across her bed, a book in her hand. He couldn’t make out the cover, but he’d bet it was a romance. She always had one in her bag. And every copy was battered and dog-eared as though it had been through many a hand before hers. For her birthday, he and Dex had bought her a new eBook reader and loaded it with credit. The look of delight in her eyes had done strange things to his heart.  
  
  Now, someone was watching her. Stalking her. And from the messages on the back of several photos, the creep knew how he and Dex felt about her. And, Slade suspected, Gavin too.  
  
  This threat seemed so surreal, but the proof was staring him in the face. Someone wanted to hurt Hannah.  
  
  Gavin frowned. “I don’t have cameras outside my office doors. Maybe I should have listened to Dex about that. I’m sure he’s is in the mailroom now, interrogating the employees.” He sighed. “I think I should call in an outside firm.”  
  
  “What happened between you two? He put his fist through a wall.” Slade’s stomach was turning at the idea of some asshole harassing Hannah, but he had to deal with  
his brothers’  
  
  problems, too. Gavin would only be talking about calling in an outside security firm if things had gone terribly wrong between them.  
  
  “It’s complicated.” Gavin looked down, a sure sign that he was ashamed of something.  
  
  “How about I uncomplicate it for you? You took one look at these photographs and blamed Dex. Because he wants her badly, you leapt to the stupid conclusion that he was desperate or impulsive enough to become a peeping Tom. And his only choice was to call bullshit and walk out. Simple enough?”  
  
  Gavin’s gun metal gray eyes flashed back up, but there was a weariness to them that had Slade backing off. “Almost spot on. I thought Dex was using the photos to tempt me into joining the two of you in seducing Hannah. I know you want that, Slade. I can’t do it. I just can’t. Dex took offense to my mistake, and now he says he’s quitting as soon as she’s out of danger.”  
  
  “And Dex leaving is all right with you?” Slade wasn’t sure he wanted the answer to that question, but he had to ask.  
  
  Gavin clenched his fists. “No, it’s not. Damn it, Slade, he’s my brother, too. I have no intention of letting him walk out because of a misunderstanding.”  
  
  “I was listening in, Gavin. Dex didn’t misunderstand. You flat out blamed him.” Gavin sat back, raking his hand through his thick, chocolate-brown hair. “Okay, I’ll rephrase.  
  
  I have no intention of losing my brother because I was an asshole. Nor do I intend to allow someone to stalk my admin.”  
  
  Slade bit back a smile. Despite the horrors of the morning, he sensed a little progress. Gavin had admitted that he didn’t want to lose Dex. He was still calling Hannah his admin, but that would change, if Slade had his way. “Have you talked to Hannah yet?” Slade wasn’t looking forward to the conversation. Hannah was going to be terrified when she found out about these pictures. He stacked them, pulling out the least salacious one. They would have to show her so she grasped how serious this was, but he didn’t want to embarrass her.  
  
  “Not yet. I wanted to talk to you first. We’ll do our due diligence and call the police to report the threat, but there’s not much they can do unless this bastard has actually committed a crime.  
  
  They’ll tell her to lock her doors and buy a dog.”  
  
  Slade shook his head. “She’s a cat person. I’m sure Mr. Snuggles will be hell on intruders.  
  
  She’ll purr them to death.”  
  
  Gavin frowned. “Mr. Snuggles is a she?”  
  
  “Hannah was fifteen when she got her,” Slade couldn’t help but smile. “Apparently, she didn’t think to look for boy or girl parts. The name stuck.” Gavin threw his head back and laughed. The rich, deep sound filled the room and made Slade realize just how much he’d missed his older brother’s laughter. It had been so damn long since he’d heard it.  
  
  Gavin had tears of mirth in his eyes when he came up for air. “She has a transvestite cat.”  
  
  “She says Mr. Snuggles is just gender confused.” Hannah loved that damn cat. Slade knew he was going to have to learn to love the little furball, too.  
  
  “Such a silly, sweet girl,” Gavin said, his gaze straying to the photos.  
  
  There it was, that smile—with a healthy hint of lust—that told Slade everything he needed to know.  
  
  “We have to protect her,” Slade pointed out.  
  
  “I have a plan, and I hope you’ll back me on it. It should keep Hannah safe and bring Dex back into the fold.”  
  
  There was nothing Slade wanted more than that. “I’m listening.” Gavin hesitated. “You heard Dex say that he would take Hannah with him when he left, Slade. I know how you feel about her. Maybe you need to talk to him. I don’t want Hannah coming between the two of you.”  
  
  And just like that, Slade’s cock got hard. An image of Hannah between him and Dex assaulted his brain. She would be so small sandwiched by their bigger bodies. They would have to be careful, but they would get inside her, so deep that she wouldn’t know where they ended and she began.  
  
  “Oh, she’s going to be between us.”  
  
  Gavin flushed slightly. “That’s not fair to Hannah. She’s not some club bunny for the two of you to fuck and forget.”  
  
  Slade wasn’t going to take this crap from his brother. He would never play games with Hannah. He’d known from the moment he’d seen her that she was different. “Dex and I love Hannah. We’re not going to forget her; we’re going to build a life with her. This isn’t some one-night stand.”  
  
  “Are you both insane? No one will accept that kind of relationship here.”  
  
  “I’m not going to live my life by some societal dictate. And they will accept us. I have a billion-dollar trust fund. Let them talk all they like, but money opens doors. What would be unacceptable for a normal person is merely a quirk for the superrich.” It was a harsh reality.  
  
  Slade and Dex had talked this out, hashing out plans over months to get what they wanted and protect Hannah from nasty gossip at the same time. Now if Gavin would just get with the program, their lives could begin.  
  
  “That’s an argument for another time,” Gavin conceded. “Now, we have to figure out what to do with Hannah. I was thinking that, perhaps, she needs a small vacation.” Slade frowned. “There is no fucking way I’m letting her run off by herself.”  
  
  “Of course not. But maybe Alaska would be a good place for her now. You did say you have to go see to some trouble there. River Run is isolated, and we own the whole damn town. All three of us can take Hannah and hide out while the security team figures this out.” It took all Slade had not to fist pump in victory. “Perfect. When do we leave?” Gavin sat back in his chair. “Today. But I want to be clear. I’m only going to work things out with Dex. I’ll help with Hannah, if the need arises. But that’s it.” Slade wasn’t fooled. His older brother could lie to himself, but Slade knew the truth. Gavin could more easily monitor the situation from Dallas. Since Slade had always been the go-between for Gavin and Dex, it seemed obvious that Gavin was coming along because he wanted to repair the relationship with Dex…and because he couldn’t stand to let his two younger brothers have Hannah all to themselves.  
  
  Slade contained his excitement—barely. “Understood. I’ll make the arrangements. Then we can talk to Hannah.”  
  
  Gavin nodded as though happy with the decision. “Excellent. We’ll have to convince her to go, you know.”  
  
  Slade would have to convince her of more than just an impromptu trip to Alaska. He was going to have to persuade her—and everyone else—that this ménage relationship could work. To do that, he had to restore peace between Dex and Gavin. Then he had to talk Gavin into sharing Hannah with them. Hell, he also had to convince Hannah that taking on three passionate, dominant men would be a dandy idea.  
  
  “No problem, Gavin.” Slade sounded way more confident than he felt.  
  
  But as he walked out of Gavin’s office to start planning, he vowed to make it work.  
  
  \* \* \* \*  
  
  Dex parked his Harley about a block away from Hannah’s apartment and started walking.  
  
  His cell trilled, and he pulled it out of his pocket. Slade. Probably wanting to talk about Gavin.  
  
  Dex growled. He thought about ignoring it, but did what he always did when it came to Slade.  
  
  He gave in.  
  
  But that didn’t mean Dex had to be nice about it.  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “Well, I suppose I should be happy you’re using words and not just grunting.” Dex had no comeback for that. Grunting was a perfectly acceptable form of communication in his book. It got the job done. So did growling, snorting, and just flat planting his fist in another guy’s face. When he found whoever was stalking Hannah, he didn’t intend to give the fucker a nice long lecture.  
  
  Slade’s sigh came across loud and clear. “Damn it, Dex. Where are you? You have to set aside this crap with Gavin and get your ass back to the office. Hannah’s in trouble.”  
  
  “I know that,” Dex practically yelled into the phone. “I’m going to her place. I want to see if I can figure out where t  
he jerk has been hiding when he does his stalkarazzi thing.”  
  
  “Maybe that will give us some clues about his identity. That’s a great idea.”  
  
  “Yeah, well, it’s what I do for a living.”  
  
  When would his older brothers finally understand that he was damn good at his job?  
  
  Dex looked up and down the cracked sidewalks of Hannah’s neighborhood. It was old, with a ton of mature trees, but he’d never liked her living here. Hannah’s apartment was in a rundown fourplex. The paint was peeling, and one of her screens was propped against the side of the building. He’d bet it was the one to her bedroom window, and that fucker had taken it off. Had Hannah not noticed? The nearby tree would be a great place for this scumbag to hide and snap pictures. But what the hell was Hannah doing lying around her bedroom with the shades wide open?  
  
  “Look, you do your thing, but be back at the office by one. We’re going to take Hannah to Alaska with us.”  
  
  Dex stopped. “We are? Hannah wants to go to Alaska?”  
  
  “Not exactly,” Slade admitted. “We’re going to talk her into it. We’ll say it’s a business trip.  
  
  But we can keep her safe there until the police figure this shit out and nail this guy. I really do have to go up there. I’m the head engineer. I’ll convince her that she needs to take notes or something.”  
  
  Dex knew he should stay here. He should be the one running the investigation. Damn, it meant Slade would probably sleep with Hannah. There was no way his brother would have such close access to Hannah and not claim her now that they’d decided she was theirs. But he trusted Slade. “Take care of our girl. You explain that I love her, too, but I need to find the bastard who’s stalking her.”  
  
  Hannah’s safety was more important than his dick, though his dick was protesting mightily.  
  
  Dex walked up the stairs to Hannah’s apartment. They wobbled under him. Ratty old place. It reminded him of his last foster home. The house had been falling down around them, but his foster father spent every dime on beer, cigarettes, and the lotto.",1,1749217892.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Personally i don't drink coffee at all. But in the movies they always act like they are zombies before morning coffee yes? I know movies are exaggerating but it's kinda in line with real life exp.

So I’ve put together a special Zodiac Forecast for June based on your animal sign!

This post covers:🐭 Rat🐮 Ox🐯 Tiger🐰 Rabbit🐲 Dragon🐍 Snake

**I’ll be sharing the rest of the signs tomorrow — stay tuned! 💫🌿**

📌 Just a quick reminder: This is a general forecast based on your Zodiac sign only.

**If you want a more personalized and accurate reading, you’ll need a full BaZi chart reading.**

**If you enjoy what I share and feel like supporting me, you can always** [**buy me a coffee**](http://paypal.me/ginachung16) **— it’s a small thing, but it means a lot to me and really encourages me to keep sharing 💛☕️**

**🐭 June 2025 Forecast for the Rat (Born in: 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, etc.)**

🌿 Energy Overview:You’re entering a “Zi-Wu Clash” phase — intense, unstable, and potentially chaotic. This type of energy can feel like you’re constantly getting hit by waves — just when you recover from one situation, another challenge appears. Expect disruptions in multiple areas of life.

💰 Wealth & Finances: This month brings the potential for financial loss, especially through unexpected events. Investments may not go well either. Best advice: avoid risky ventures and cut unnecessary spending. Focus on protecting what you already have.

❤️ Love & Relationships: Single? Not the best month for finding love. In a relationship? You may face emotional distance or even interference from others. The clash energy can manifest as neglect or tension, so now is a good time to rebuild connection and talk openly with your partner.

💼 Career & Work: Work may feel like a minefield this month. Accidents, delays, and issues with team communication are likely. Your projects might not go as planned. The best way to handle this: take things step by step, and don’t rush. Stay organized and stick to procedures.

🧘‍♀️ Health: Physically, you may feel more drained than usual. Immune resistance drops — common colds, digestive issues, or general fatigue could arise. Time to prioritize rest and wellness.

**🐂 June 2025 Forecast for the Ox (Born in: 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, etc.)**

🌿 Energy Overview : Starting from June 5, the Ox will enter the Chou-Wu Clash phase, which brings with it a wave of conflict and controversy. You may find yourself caught in the middle of gossip, misunderstandings, or malicious rumors that could negatively affect your growth. It’s a time to lay low and focus on maintaining good relationships with others.

💰 Wealth & Finances: For Oxen involved in side jobs or additional income streams, you might experience some small gains — a slight boost to your finances. However, beware of obstacles; there’s a risk of someone trying to undermine you or interfere with your business. It’s essential to be vigilant about protecting your business information and make decisions cautiously to avoid unnecessary financial losses.

❤️ Love & Relationships: While love may seem lively on the surface, there's hidden tension. Peach blossom luck (romantic energy) is present, but beware of troublesome relationships, as many people may have ulterior motives. If you’re single, be cautious of those who may not have pure intentions. For those in relationships, it's vital to stay faithful and avoid situations that could harm your relationship.

💼 Career & Work: Work productivity might suffer this month. There’s a tendency to procrastinate, and this can affect your performance and work quality. Additionally, external interference from others may make your tasks more difficult to complete. Stay focused on your responsibilities, and avoid distractions. Building positive relationships with colleagues and superiors will also help you navigate this challenging time.

🧘‍♀️ Health: Your health is generally stable, with no major issues expected. However, it’s important not to let your guard down. Ensure you have a balanced routine with enough rest — aim for early bedtimes and wake up early to maintain your overall well-being.

1l4srl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BackwoodsCreepy/comments/1l4srl3/mountains_of_appalachia/,Mountains of Appalachia,"After my family bought the cabin… We started seeing some really weird things. 

After we clean the place out and burned all of what was in there. We started fixing it up.  The cabin was in the middle of 46 acres of forest. It had been abandoned for over two years. The last owners sold it at a steel and we couldn’t quite figure out why.

It took days and weeks to get all of the junk out of the house and the surrounding yard. Because of the remote location, it made more sense to just burn everything rather than haul it off to the dump. Over the next months, my family and I spent all vacations Cleaning up, fixing, and replacing pieces of the house until it was a livable vacation home. Then it started happening.

The first instance was small and simple. I was staying by myself. In the master bedroom. I’m not a big dreamer, but I woke up terrified three nights in a row.

That was the end of that vacation, but two months later I went back up. The first night was normal the second night I woke up afraid again with no seeming explanation. The third night I woke up because I felt like I was being squeezed, and when I did, I tried to sit up, but the squeezing sensation didn’t go away. It was like someone had wrapped their arms around me from behind. Within the mattress.

Eventually, I got up made a cup of coffee. I just stood there thinking that this must’ve just been a bad dream and I had forgotten about it by the next night.  The last night of that trip, I woke up in the middle of the night sure that I was not asleep because I kept hearing the same words repeated over and over slowly, getting louder in a raspy voice somewhere between a whisper and a screen. “Get out “

So I did

Naturally, I wanted to ask for directions at reception, but genuinely couldn't as the receptionist was an attractive women in her 20's. I 100% know that I'd speak to a male receptionist without hesitation.

Also, asking a cute bartender for food/drink is equally as difficult, but I couldn't care less if the bartender is a guy.

The person sat next to me at the bar? If it's a guy it's not a problem to start a conversation, but a cute women? Forget about it.

The advice I keep hearing is that I I need to remove anything sex related from my mind, but that shouldn't be a factor when ordering a coffee at 8am lol.

Oh yeah, I also struggle talking to my friends girlfriends despite knowing them for years, and I obviously don't have any sex related thoughts about my friends girlfriends.

1l4sk10,https://i.redd.it/v3dh3jovna5f1.jpeg,Day 14 out of 60- crumbling but still standing,"Hi fellow Redditors and Redditesses,

Just wanted to write a short update regarding my campaign. Technically, the end of today will be the 14th, but I still wanted to share regardless. As of this morning, I'm 109.6kg/241.6lb. So you can also rephrase this post as the first 10kg/22lb, or the first third of my campaign. (Technically 10.4kg/23lb)

I notice the difference significantly. The pants that I was wearing without a belt were almost loose, so they could fall off without a belt. I also noticed it in my shirts and tees, my belly doesn't pop out anymore. My friends who last saw me on my 1st day also noticed I look leaner now. ""Hey, I'm overweight, not obese!"" I chuckled :D

I won't sugarcoat it. This thing comes at a cost. I consistently suffer from postural hypotension when I get up from bed(don't worry it lasts 20-30sec but you still have to be careful), or in some cases, from my seat, even. I'm short of breath after every 2km I walk. Even short bus rides become very tiring, especially if the road is bumpy. My fuse also gets shortened significantly. I'm still polite and respectful to everyone as usual, but when I encounter passive-aggressive behavior, or such impolite things but you usually don't even bother, for example, in a cafe, your chair being taken away without permission, I tend to get so much more annoyed than I used to. This poses a great challenge to keep my composure and calmness, but I still leave the scene without any incident. In the end, despite I can speak the local language, I'm still a foreigner, so it's better to lay low. Such moments were almost costing me my entire journey in fasting, too. You know, bad temper triggers hunger, but I'm aware too that it's very dangerous to eat anything now, I'm not willed to stare the ceiling of an internist's polyclinic just because of some rude person that I won't even remember their face after 15m; so instead I wash my face and neck, and sip some coffee. Boom. It goes away.

That was the reason I wrote in the caption 'crumbling', it's not my willpower that crumbles, it's my strength and endurance that are being tested time to time(note that what I write is specific occasions that don't happen 24/7). You'll see in the graph that my losses per day are also meager compared to the first week, but I already knew it, and I believe if I do my lesson everyday such as green tea or black coffee, walk and not to be a couch potato, as much as my body allows me to. I take my electrolytes and multivitamins too, and drink lots of water. This thing makes you thirsty more often than usual, so it's automatically impossible not to. 

I was planning to write this check-in on my birthday(after 3 days), but thought it'd be a good idea to share a 2-week/1st third of my journey. 

It's obviously not the end of the world if I stop, but unless my health gets into serious trouble, I'll go until the end. What I'm encountering are natural consequences of no food for 14 days, and my body functions fine for now.

Thank you very much for all your support and prayers, had I done this alone, I doubt I could have gone this far. I've made great friendships along the way. Please feel free to color my chatbox orange if you have any questions.

My partner and I are in the process of opening a small coffee shop in Paris, focused on black teas, coffee, lattes, and sweets.   
Tea is a huge part of our culture, and that’s where our roots and expertise lie.

That said, we know that many of our future customers will also want good coffee — and we **really** want to do it right. We’re new to the world of espresso and want to learn as much as possible to serve something we can be proud of.

We’re currently trying to choose an espresso machine and are feeling a bit overwhelmed. A few questions we’re hoping you can help with:

* **Is a two-group machine absolutely necessary** for a small shop like ours (around 10-15 seatings) ? Or can we manage with a high-quality single group?
* **Is renting a machine a good option** for newcomers like us, or is buying second-hand better in the long run ?
* Any favorite **brands/models** you’d recommend for consistency, ease of use, and reliability for baristas who are just getting started ? Everyone seems to use La Marzocco in the coffee shops here, but the entry ticket is so high 😱
* How important is local service and maintenance support when choosing a machine? Should we prioritize brands that are easier to maintain or repair locally? **Are machine breaking down during shift a common occurence** ?

We’re incredibly grateful for any advice this amazing community can offer. We’re here to learn and grow, and we truly appreciate any insights you can share.

Once it starts to cool it doesn't taste good at all. Kind of like beer, ice cold its great but once it warms up its no good.

But here is what I have noticed with the coffee I roast. When it cools down I still really enjoy it and don't have to nuke it in the microwave. Sometimes I even get some different notes/flavors I didn't taste when the temp was hotter. 

And I will also turn it into an iced coffee that is really enjoyable. I never throw away any coffee that I have roasted as it can always be used as a great cold drink.

# 🎯 Observations so far

# 1. Word Order ≠ Visual Order

**Finding:** Rearranging prompt order has minimal effect on object placement

* ❌ `""red cube and blue sphere""` vs `""blue sphere and red cube""` → similar layouts
* ❌ `""woman and man""` vs `""man and woman""` → woman still appears on left (gender bias)

**Note:** This contradicts my anecdotal experience with the dev model, where prompt order seemed significant. Either the full model handles order differently, or my initial observations were influenced by other factors.

# 2. Natural Language > Tags

This aligns with [my previous findings](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1l4epge/hidream_prompt_importance_natural_vs_tagbased/) where natural language consistently outperformed tag-based prompts. In this test:

* ✅ Full sentences with explicit positioning worked best
* ❌ Tag-style prompts (`1girl, 1boy, holding hands`) often produced extra limbs
* ✅ Natural descriptions (`""The red-haired woman is holding hands with the man in a blue shirt""`) were more reliable

# 3. Explicit Positioning Works Best

**Finding:** Directional keywords override all other cues

* ✅ `""woman on left, man on right""` → reliable positioning
* ✅ `""cat on left, dog in middle, bird on right""` → perfect execution
* ✅ Even works with complex scenes: `""man on left kissing woman on right""`

# 4. The Persistent Extra Limb Problem

**Finding:** Overspecifying interactions creates anatomical issues

* ⚠️ `""holding hands""` mentioned multiple times → extra arms appear
* ⚠️ Complex syntax with brackets/parentheses → more likely to glitch
* ✅ Simple, single mention of interaction → cleaner results

# 5. Syntax Experiments (Interesting Results)

I tested 20+ formatting styles for the same prompt. The clear winner? **Simple prose.**

**Tested formats:**

* Parentheses: `(woman, red hair) and (man, blue shirt)`
* Brackets: `[woman with red hair] and [man with blue shirt]`
* Structured: `person A: woman, red hair; person B: man, blue shirt`
* Anime notation: `1girl red hair, 1boy blue shirt`
* Cast style: `Alice (red hair) and Bob (blue shirt)`

**Result:** All produced similar outputs! Complex syntax didn't improve control and sometimes caused artifacts.

# 6. Three-Person Scenes Are More Stable

**Finding:** Adding a third person actually reduces errors

* More consistent positioning
* Fewer extra limbs
* ""Watching"" actions work well for the third person

# 🎨 Best Practices (What actually works for these simpler tests)

    [character description] on [position] [action] with [character description] on [position]

# ✅ Examples:

* **Good:** `""red-haired woman on left holding hands with man in blue shirt on right""`
* **Bad:** `""woman (red hair) and man (blue shirt) holding hands together""`
* **Worse:** `""1girl red hair, 1boy blue shirt, holding hands""`

# ✅ For Groups:

    ""Alice with red hair on left, Bob in blue shirt in center, Carol with blonde hair on right, first two holding hands""

# 🚫 What to Avoid

1. **Over-describing interactions** \- Say ""holding hands"" once, not three times
2. **Ambiguous positioning** \- Always specify left/right/center
3. **Complex syntax** \- Brackets, pipes, and structured formats don't help
4. **Tag-based prompting** \- Natural language works better with HiDream
5. **Assuming order matters** \- It doesn't

# 🔬 Notable Edge Cases

* **""Triangular formation""** → Generated overhead perspective looking down
* **""Clustered in center""** → Created dynamic poses with people leaning in
* **""Asymmetrically arranged""** → Produced abstract/artistic interpretations
* **Gender terminology** affects style: ""woman/man"" → realistic, ""girl/boy"" → anime

# 📈 What's Next?

Currently testing: Token limits - How many tokens before coherence breaks? (Testing 10-500+ tokens)

# 💡 TL;DR for Best Results:

1. **Use natural language**, not tags (see [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1l4epge/hidream_prompt_importance_natural_vs_tagbased/))
2. **Be explicit about positions** (left/right/center)
3. **Keep it simple** \- Natural language beats complex syntax
4. **Mention interactions once** \- Repetition causes glitches
5. **Expect gender biases** \- Plan accordingly
6. **Three people > two people** for stability",4,1749216446.0,StableDiffusion,0,1.0,False
1l4sej6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l4sej6/struggling_to_get_a_good_extraction_delonghi/,Struggling to Get a Good Extraction [De'Longhi Dedica Arte],"Hi everyone, I’m not sure if this is the right place to talk about this, but two weeks ago I was given a De'Longhi Dedica Arte espresso machine as a gift.

I only started looking into how to properly brew coffee with it these past few days, since I had always used a Lavazza machine that worked with capsules. Ever since I got the new one, I haven’t been able to figure out why I can't get a good extraction. I've tried commercial blends and even ESE pods, but compared to my old machin, which produced a nice, dense coffee with a decent amount of crema, this one gives me a watery shot that lacks body and creaminess.

I also tried using the double shot filter, but I really can’t afford to use 15-17 grams of coffee per shot, both for health and financial reasons.

Online I see people getting amazing extractions with this machine... 
What am I doing wrong? Do I really need to start buying whole coffee beans?

(I have to admit, it's also a matter of laziness, if there's no way to make a good coffee using commercial blends or pods, just tell me straight so I'm more likely to start taking extraction seriously🫠)",1,1749216437.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1l4s8mm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4s8mm,Let's Talk About Scale Inhibitors in RO Systems - Separating Facts from Fear,"I've noticed growing concerns about phosphate-based scale inhibitors in water filters, especially after some viral posts. As someone in the industry, let's have a balanced discussion - dissent welcome!

1️⃣ Scale Inhibitor = Phosphate? So is Soda Dangerous Too?

Yes, most inhibitors use food-grade polyphosphates – the same stuff found in:

• Hot dogs & instant noodles (pH regulator)

• Soda & bread (anti-oxidant)

• Milk (natural phosphorus source)

Key Point: Dosage and grade matter. Unlike industrial phosphates (like those illegally used in ""chemical-soaked shrimp""), NSF-42 certified food-grade polyphosphate in RO systems adds mere milligrams – safety evaluated.

2️⃣ Why Even Use Scale Inhibitors?

• RO Membrane Protection (Especially in hard water areas): Without them, calcium buildup can wreck $200 membranes in months.

• Water Quality Control: Ever seen those chalky kettle deposits? That's what happens without inhibition – your TDS spikes too.

3️⃣ Safety Check ✅

• NSF-42 Certification = The gold standard. If it passes this, it's safer than most tap water.

• RO Filtration Myth: RO pores (0.0001μm) are 1000x smaller than phosphate molecules. That ""0.1% residue"" people worry about? Less than what's in your breakfast cereal.

🛒 Choosing a Safe System (No Brand Promo)

• Prioritize NSF-certified systems (look for Standard 42 and 58)

• Big brands undergo way more testing than generic filters

Final Thought: We live in an era where ""chemical"" ≠ ""bad."" Phosphates are to water treatment what citric acid is to food preservation. Fear spreads faster than facts – let's change that.

He works in an office with another guy. I remember I entered the office wih my coworker and we went to ask the other guy something as there was a system issue. We sat there for a while. Our guy was sitting on his desk right in front of us on the other side of the room. After a few minutes, he stood up, put on his blazer jacket and took a while grooming and preening himself whike I was sitting there in front of him. Of course he wasn't facing me but he was right in my line of sight. I remember thinking, God, he's so full of himself lol. 


Fast forward a few weeks, I was calling one of his guys in the department and the call got diverted to his phone. It's a Cisco phone. So he picked up and I talked to him asking about the other guy and even asked him if he can help but he said, I can wait for the other guy and call him back. He was nice. It happened a couple times that the call got diverted but I hung up on the first ring. But then I noticed him approaching my desk when I did so. It happened twice. Usually after I hang up. He walks by my desk and then stands with another coworker nearby for a few minutes. Recently I started saying hi to him when I walk past him. A couple days ago, I was walking towards my desk through this long corridor and he was about to enter his room, he lingered in front of his door and looked at me. I wasn't paying attention to him. Not sure if he was saying anything but he took a while and then he entered the room and gently closed the door and then I continued on to my desk. I saw him yesterday while openeng a door and he was passing through with his coffee. I said good morning and he replied but he wasn't smiling or anything. But a couple hours later I saw him going inside the printer room in front of my desk. He took the paper out and looked at it then he looked to the side where I sat there. I didn't make eye contact but I felt he was looking at me.

I've started noticing how handsome he is and maybe I'm beginning to have a crush on him but I want to make sure there's something there from his side.

**Background**

33M, lawyer, working in a Tier 1 city. Married. DINK (no plans whatsover)

Been working for almost 9 years now. Law degree was expensive (even though it was from a top NLU) and parents did not have the means to fund it. We took an education loan, the outstanding amount on which was around 11 lakhs by the time I graduated. Paid that off in the first two years of working and have been regularly investing since then.

My primary aim is to see if I can CoastFire in the next 4-5 years once I reach a NW of around 3 CR. I am aware that CoastFire in India can be hard. That said, I would ideally want to take up something in a non-corporate, low stress environment which does not amplify my triggers (had a fucked up childhood and been in therapy for some stuff)

For now, I think maybe something of a sort of a librarian or a book store manager could be good (not sure how much it would pay , if it is toxic etc.) The main aim is to look for a non stressful role which I can do as a lawyer.

**FY 25 Updates:**

1. Hit NW of 1 CR in Sep 24 (increase of around 37% as compared to my NW in April 24). 
2. Current NW is 1.2 CR. I do not own a flat in the city where I live. Have a flat back home but we do not think we will ever stay there. Have exercised shares worth 55 lakhs and the company could go public by 2027 but I do not assume anything and dont count this number in my NW calculation.  
3. Current NW includes MF +EPF+ PPF.
4. Breakdown of 1.2CR- MF (95.76 Lakhs), EPF (14.6 Lakhs), PPF (10.69 Lakhs)
5. Changed job last year which led to a salary bump and increased savings. 
6. Current Savings %age is around 66%
7. Current Expenses are 67000 per month (including rent). 
8. Monthly expense excludes 10K allowance to my mother and 9k which I put aside for domestic trips.
9. Out of the 67000 monthly expense -30k is rent and 5800 is term insurance premium (need to pay until 2030). Rest expenses are met with the available 31K.
10. It helps that I am generally frugal, have realised what I like and mostly spend on that. Speciality Coffee +Books- this is around 2500 per month.

I just want to thank this community again. Stumbled in the old sub reddit somewhere in 2018 and it was an eye opener and extremely comforting to find similar folks who thought that there is more to life than just work.

I recently switched from the Barista Express grinder to a DF64 Gen2 with stock burrs.  
I dialed the 0 in, found the right setting around 20.

First thing I noticed was that the usual medium roast beans I use really had more flavours since the change- wether this is all in my head or in my cup. There's way more definition and I can finally taste the different beans but also my short comings as a home barista!

Second thing I flagged is that the beans yield some sort of light coloured flakes, which I never had with the Barista grinder. My concern is that I've seen in other posts that that was the result of poor quality grinders.

So, I think the coffee is good, but the looks of my ground coffee is not.

# Best Thermal grease 2025: Top Picks & Expert Buying Guide

Thermal grease, also known as thermal paste, thermal compound, or heat sink compound, is a crucial component for efficient heat transfer between electronic components, such as CPUs and GPUs, and their corresponding heat sinks. It's primary function is to fill the microscopic air gaps between these surfaces, which would otherwise impede heat dissipation. Without adequate thermal grease, components can overheat, leading to performance degradation, system instability, and even permanent damage. As processing power and heat generation continue to increase, selecting the best thermal grease becomes increasingly meaningful for maintaining optimal performance and longevity of computing devices.This guide will explore the top thermal grease options for 2025,providing an in-depth analysis of their features,benefits,and suitability for different users.

## Key Features Analysis

The performance of thermal grease is resolute by several factors, including its thermal conductivity, viscosity, electrical conductivity, and longevity.

**Thermal Conductivity:** This is arguably the most important factor, indicating how effectively the grease transfers heat. It is indeed typically measured in Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/mK). A higher thermal conductivity rating indicates better heat transfer capabilities.

Thermal conductivity determines how efficiently heat travels from the component to the heat sink.Grease with a higher W/mK rating will generally result in lower operating temperatures for the CPU or GPU, leading to improved performance and stability. Though, it’s critically important to note that beyond a certain point, increasing thermal conductivity yields diminishing returns, and other factors like application technique become more significant.

**Viscosity:** The viscosity of the thermal grease affects its consistency and ease of application. A grease that is to thick can be difficult to spread evenly, while one that is too thin may run or leak.

Optimal viscosity allows for easy and uniform coverage of the component's surface. Ideally, the thermal grease should have a slightly creamy consistency. Some products come with applicators to ensure the correct amount is applied, especially for users who are less experienced with the process.Products with well-balanced viscosity are generally preferred to prevent both application difficulties and performance problems.

**Electrical Conductivity:** Non-conductive thermal grease is essential to prevent short circuits. Conductive pastes offer slightly improved performance, but carry a high risk.

The vast majority of thermal greases are designed to be electrically non-conductive to safeguard against accidental short circuits, which can cause irreversible damage to the electronic components. While some high-performance options utilize conductive materials like metal particles to enhance thermal conductivity, they require extreme caution during application to avoid contact with surrounding circuitry. Therefore, non-conductive thermal greases remain the safer and more practical choice for most users.

**Longevity:** The lifespan of thermal grease varies, with some requiring reapplication after a year or two, while others can last for several years.The durability and long-term performance of thermal grease are important considerations.Some cheaper products dry out or pump-out over time, losing their effectiveness and necessitating reapplication. High-quality thermal greases use formulations designed to resist degradation, maintaining their thermal conductivity and preventing the need for frequent maintenance. Consider manufacturer specifications and user reviews to determine expected longevity.

Key features to consider when selecting thermal grease:

*   High thermal conductivity for efficient heat transfer
*   Appropriate viscosity for easy application
*   Electrically non-conductive for safety
*   Long lifespan to minimize reapplication frequency

## Core Benefits

Using high-quality thermal grease provides numerous benefits, including improved system performance, increased component lifespan, and enhanced stability.

**Improved Performance:** Effective thermal grease lowers operating temperatures, allowing CPUs and GPUs to run at their maximum clock speeds without thermal throttling. This results in faster processing speeds and smoother gameplay.

Lower temperatures translate directly into better performance. Cpus and gpus are designed to reduce their operating speed (thermal throttling) when they get too hot. High-quality thermal paste will keep those components running cooler, which in turn allows them to maintain a higher clock speed.

**enhanced Component Lifespan:** By preventing overheating, thermal grease helps to extend the lifespan of expensive electronic components such as CPUs and GPUs.

excessive heat is a primary cause of component failure in electronics. By ensuring that thermal grease is adequately applied and maintained, you will help extend the useful life of your computer and its most valuable parts.

**increased System Stability:** Consistent temperatures minimize the risk of system crashes and errors caused by thermal instability.Overheating can lead to unpredictable system behavior, including crashes, freezes, and data corruption. Proper thermal management through the use of quality thermal grease ensures stable operation and reduces the likelihood of encountering these issues. This is especially important for demanding tasks like gaming, video editing, and scientific simulations.

**Reduced Noise:** Cooler components might allow the computer's cooling fan speeds to be reduced, which in turn reduces overall fan noise.

## FAQs Section

**how frequently enough should I reapply thermal grease?**
The frequency of reapplication depends on the type of thermal grease used and the operating conditions of the system. Generally, it is recommended to reapply thermal grease every 1-3 years, or if you notice a significant increase in component temperatures.
**Is it necessary to clean off the old thermal grease before applying new grease?**
yes, it is crucial to thoroughly clean off any old thermal grease before applying new grease. Residue from old paste can impede heat transfer. Use isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher) and a lint-free cloth or coffee filter to clean both the CPU/GPU surface and the heat sink.

**Can I use too much thermal grease?**
yes, applying too much thermal grease can actually reduce its effectiveness. An excessive amount of grease can act as an insulator rather than a conductor of heat. Apply a small,pea-sized amount in the center of the component and allow the pressure from the heat sink to spread it evenly.

**Does the type of heat sink matter when choosing thermal grease?**
Yes, the type of heat sink can influence the choice of thermal grease. High-performance heat sinks often require premium thermal grease to maximize their cooling potential. for less demanding applications, a standard thermal grease may suffice. Ensure compatibility and consider the heat sink's material and contact surface when selecting thermal grease.

First off, a *massive thank you* to this amazing community! ❤️  
I recently purchased my first espresso machine after researching and seeking advice here. Your suggestions helped me stay within budget and still get a decent machine to kickstart my espresso journey. Couldn't have done it without you all 🙏

That said… I’m running into a bit of a problem and hoping some of you pros can help me troubleshoot. Here's what's happening:

* I’m using about **10-12g of coffee**, tamped well.
* Fill water **up to the marked line in the cylinder**.
* The **puck and cylinder are tightly sealed**—I’ve checked multiple times to ensure there’s no air leak.
* But the **espresso comes out watery**, with **no crema**, and the **pressure gauge barely moves**.

It feels like something's off—either my technique or maybe some setting I’m missing. I’ve tried the finest grind from Starbucks (they grind at Number 1, which is their finest grind for Turkish coffee), but I didn't notice any significant improvement.

The IRS treating Bitcoin as property (not currency) means every sale, trade, or even coffee purchase triggers a capital gains event. You track cost basis, calculate profit/loss per transaction, and owe taxes accordingly.

Here’s the behavioral nudge:

\- HODL indefinitely? Defer taxes entirely. Hold >1 year? Pay lower long-term rates.

\- Spend or trade? Instant tax event. Requires records, calculations, and potential liability—even for tiny amounts.

This creates asymmetric friction:

 Holding is tax-efficient and simple.

 Using BTC for payments/profits adds bureaucratic overhead—especially painful for small, frequent transactions.

Ironically, the regulatory framework accidentally reinforces Bitcoin as ""digital gold"" by making its ""peer-to-peer cash"" use case a tax nightmare. Want to spend $20? Enjoy calculating cost basis across 5 wallets since 2017!

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1l4rwiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Olongapo/comments/1l4rwiz/sbmasbfz_issad/,SBMA/SBFZ is...sad,"***Note:*** *This is a personal opinion based on my subjective feelings. I'm unaware of Olongapo or SBFZ's economic figures—these are just my emotions talking based on what I've observed.*

I moved from Quezon City to Olongapo in 2013 for my first year in high school. I rarely left our house in Metro Manila, so naturally, the SBFZ area amazed me back then.

It felt like a different country. I could walk around safely on good sidewalks, drivers strictly followed traffic rules and were pedestrian-friendly, and I didn't have to worry much about safety. Ang linis ng hangin since walang jeep and tricycles. So, I made it my hang-out spot. My family spent a lot of time playing sports at Remy Field, having picnics on the beach, and trying out new restaurants and cafes.

Fast forward to 2022. I relocated to Angeles City, Pampanga, to live with my girlfriend, who was studying there. I worked at home and, in turn, had an inactive lifestyle, so I started running sa loob ng Clark. Imagine my surprise when I saw the place for the first time.

Clark, especially around CDC/Mimosa/Aqua Planet, felt like everything that SBFZ wishes it was. Wide sidewalks, curated greenery, working traffic lights, quality bike paths, and approachable parks, to name a few. There are countless reasons to visit, such as Aqua Planet, SM Clark and Clark Cityfront, several golf courses, Clark Safari, casinos, and other well-maintained establishments. It even hosts concerts, music festivals, running and biking races, and conventions. All of these amenities and modernities justified the presence of the numerous hotels and condos in the area for short- and long-term residence.

I'm currently in Olongapo to visit my family. After running back and forth on Waterfront Rd. this morning, I walked around the area and it felt...sad.

Besides new cafes and old restaurants, all I saw were dilapidated buildings. Dilapidated sidewalks. Remnants of demolished establishments. Overgrowth everywhere. Metal sheets covering construction or more dilapidated buildings. The smell of trash and, in certain areas, urine and sewage. The beach was heavily littered, especially near the flagpole. There's nothing to do but eat, eat, drink coffee, and eat. I could book a hotel, but for what? You can't swim in the bay. Natatawa nga ako sa dami ng hotels when there is little reason to visit the place. There are no museums, quality amusement, well-maintained parks, or malls. Yes, there's Harbor Point, but it's been overshadowed by SM Central. Even the newly built sports facilities for the 2019 SEA Games are poorly maintained.

Ang lungkot lang how shitty a job the administrating government of SBFZ has been doing at maintaining the place. I hope Clark learns from this and continues to develop their jurisdiction and add more reasons to visit and stay there.

Sorry for the rant. Sobrang bummed out lang ako since SBFZ is such a missed opportunity to progress Olongapo and other neighboring municipalities. Developing the area for tourism could create so many jobs for Zambaleños outside the BPO and industrial sector, but nope. It's just there at a standstill, trying its hardest to get back on its feet with projects like renovating the 14th St. gate and Waterfront Rd. (projects that, with the LGU's track record, could go on for AT LEAST five years lol).

Or maybe I'm too pessimistic. Maybe in reality, the SBFZ economy is growing, and it's just not evident in what I'm looking at (i.e., buildings, roads, general infrastructure).

I woke up this morning in the wrong place. Nothing feels quite right. This world looks like mine, in many ways, but it's not. I don't know who to call and I don't know who can help. If anybody reads this, please, get me out. Please let me out.

I woke up this morning like normal, rolled out of bed to let out the new puppy out the back. He's been sleeping through the night, thankfully. I can't say that about my restless night. I tossed and turned for hours, never getting more than 15 minutes of actual rest. I'm tired as hell now and I don't think that will get any better in the short term. After letting him do his business, he ran back inside to eat, then laid down with one of his toys. I began my morning ritual of getting my coffee fix. Ten steps to the kitchen, turn left, open the 3rd cabinet from middle. Grab a mug, open the pouch of grounds, pour them in til they reach the 3rd line. Fill up the water, place the mug underneath, then we're off to the races. My parents always said I had OCD, but it's never really bothered me. I can remember things well when it's something I do daily. Just like every night it's; up from the couch, 20 paces to the door, turn the deadbolt back and forth, 3 times, then jiggle the doorknob left and right, 3 times. They think it's some mental illness, I just think it's a good routine.

Jokes aside, I know it's probably something like OCD but I've never been fully evaluated. It doesn't affect me or my relationships, as far as I can tell. It's tiring at times, but leaving the norm usually makes days worse. I like that way my life is set up. That's why this morning was so irritating. Ten steps to the kitchen, turn left... wall. There's no wall there. I look right, 3rd cabinet from the middle. I walk over and open it to find tea bags and small glass cups. No coffee pouches in site, nor any of my mugs. I was sent reeling, opening the rest of the cupboards to check on their status. Plastic plates with fine silverware stuffed not so neatly in the wrong places. Mixing bowls thrown haphazardly into places they don't belong, with other utensils sitting inside them. No rhyme or reason, no plan or design, and absolutely not my kitchen. I began to lose it when the sound of banging on my front door snapped me out of it. I walked calmly over to find the door unlocked already. ""*That's not my door.""* I opened it to find a man standing there, looking oddly familiar, besides the lack of eyes and hair.

  
""Oh good, you're okay! Okay you're fine. You had me worried. You haven't missed my text since three years ago. That stomach bug almost did you in. Are you ok? What's going on? I texted you but you didn't reply. It's been almost three years since you've done that. Remember when you had that stomach bug? Are you ok?""


Hearing it speak, I realized it was supposed to be my best friend, Ryan. I've been friends with Ryan for most of my life, and I would get a text from him every morning asking for my breakfast order before work. He's my neighbor, works at a bakery and knows my routine, so it's not surprising that he showed up like he did. With the way I slept last night, I must've missed grabbing my phone from the side table. I assured him I was fine and grabbed the toasted bagel with chive cream cheese from him. It was my order every morning. He laughed it off and asked if I'd be alright now, to which I didn't reply. He looked hesitantly at me and asked again. I caught myself just staring at him, but eventually told him I was fine and I needed to get a shower. He shrugged it off and said goodbye, then turned to go about his day. I slowly closed the door, and turned the deadbolt. Back and forth, three times. I quickly crept over to the window and pulled the curtains closed, but kept a small crack to watch where Ryan went. He walked out to the sidewalk and stood there, facing the street. Slowly, he turned left and started a dead sprint down the road. There's no way he could have known where he was going.



I stood there in disbelief for a moment. Before I could collect my thoughts, another banging started, this time at my basement door. It isn't a basement, per se, but more of a dark cellar used to house the HVAC and plumbing. The banging didn't stop for a full 5 minutes. I watched the clock. At that point, I had had enough, so I walked over to the door. As soon as I was 3 steps away, it stopped. I heard a slight whimpering on the other side, like a puppy. My puppy. I stepped back and peered around the hallway corner to see my puppy inside his open crate in the corner of the room. The banging started up again until I moved back, 3 steps away. This time, the whimpering was still there, but it had also been joined by a slight whispering. I couldn't make out what it was saying from where I was standing. I inched myself closer to the door, and as I did, the whispering grew louder. It was whispering, then talking, then as I got within a foot of it, the voice was screaming.



""LET ME OUT. LET ME OUT. LET ME OUT. LET ME OUT."" Over and over again. I backed away but it didn't subside. Instead, it started banging the door violently in between in phrase. I could hear the doorknob rattle and the hinges creak as it was happening. I turned away, ran over to the dog and grabbed him up, then ran into my room. I've been here since. It's been 53 minutes (will be longer before I post this) and it hasn't stopped. I'm wearing headphones to help drown it out. I swear I can hear it through my vents too, and about 2 hours and 4 minutes ago, I started to hear a scratching. Since then, I've determined that it's coming from below me, under the floorboards, like someone is trying to chisel their way through it with their fingernails. I've checked my phone a few times and I can't text or call. Services seems to only be working one-way, because I am receiving them. I've gotten exactly one text since the banging started, from Ryan. It reads, ""Hey buddy! You should do as you're told.""",8,1749214711.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

We’re still early. $23M market cap early.  
But the velocity? Unreal.

**Execution > Vibes**

Everyone has ideas.  
Kendu ships.

* 🌭 *Kendu Hot Dogs in Florida* : real food, real margins
* ☕ *Kendu Coffee from Brazil* : live in the UK, e-comm enabled

Kendu is omnipresent:

Reddit. Twitter. TikTok. Telegram. Stocktwits. IG.

Not hype: **ubiquity**.

Oh, and it just became the **second project ever** to cross 50,000 Certik votes.  
The first was $PEPE.

Community Trust Score: **98**.  
You don’t buy that. You build it.

Pepe. Shiba. Doge.  
All were memetic wars won by communities.

But Kendu isn’t just a crowd. It’s an army.

Builder-led. Borderless. Relentless.

Crypto has a reputation problem.  
Grifts. Rugs. Celebrity scams.

Kendu says: touch it, taste it, wear it, play it.

Community as Service

It’s Red Bull x Ethereum.  
Nike x Permissionless culture.  
A decentralized LVMH in alpha.

**Final Transmission**

Kendu is not a coin.  
It’s a **cultural engine**.

At $23M cap, it’s a startup with traction most Series A brands dream of.  
And it’s owned by the people building it.

Context: I’ve been lucid dreaming unintentionally pretty much every other month for 2 years, it’s been 4 years total that I’ve been lucid dreaming. Many of my lucid dreams have been induced after taking a 4-5 day break from my relentless weed smoking habits (which makes sense to me with the increased rem sleep you get from quitting smoking).

April I decided I would really buckle down and learn the techniques and start inducing my dreams intentionally like a skill rather than a whim. So I read the book “Exploring the World Lucid Dreaming”, I started doing reality checks, ADA, Questioning my reality, little bit of LOA, Dream journalling roughly 2-4 dreams a night, checking for dream signs, etc. I quit drinking and smoking altogether to improve my results.

Anyways, I’ve been doing this for 2 months now, and I did lucid dream as of last night unintentionally which is great! I actually went in this time and appreciated my dream and wow it lasted so much longer! But here’s what I’ve confused about:

This week has been a particularly difficult and stressful week for me, and so finally I decided I’d let go off everything just for this week. All my reality checks, questioning, dream journaling, LOA, I drank, I smoked and ate gummies, I had absolutely no intention of lucid dreaming—

And then I had one. A rather long one where I didn’t need to do reality checks, I had no concerns or lack of control over my lucidity for the first time. I just knew I was dreaming and appreciated my dream around me while understanding that I was dreaming and it got me farther than anything else I’ve done in my dreams before. I’m just wondering what everyone’s thoughts are on this? 

Last thing is that this was paired with unintentional WBTB. I pretty much WBTB every day though, my boyfriend gets up at 4am, I get up to make him some coffee and feed our dog and go back to bed. I always thought WBTB could never apply to me because I’m so used to it.

I remember looking up my exact stats, trying to project myself onto these stories and see how their results look - since they could be mine. 

You can succeed as a splitter, but you need to make sure every part of your application outside of your weak point is tight. I decided I was applying to law school while working, so I couldn’t control my GPA, but I could control everything else. This focuses more on the “everything else” than GPA or LSAT.

Most of this advice is not from my own findings but rather from talking to those more knowledgeable than myself. Specifically, I utilized my undergraduate institution’s pre-law office, a discord server (shout out LLB), LSAC events, friends (and conversations those friends had), and those I met who are also applying/recently applied.

Here is my lsd profile: [https://www.lsd.law/users/creep/carbonoxygenneon](https://www.lsd.law/users/creep/carbonoxygenneon)

**GPA:**

My GPA is “good” by lay standards but below the 25th for basically every t14 and the median of every t50. I chose to write a GPA addendum because I felt that I had information that gave additional context to my situation, which I think a lot of splitters also do. This context helps an admissions officer better understand your story.

If you can still control your GPA, bring it up. Work hard and don’t focus on the LSAT yet. If there’s a professor who really likes you/you perform really well in their class, you should not be afraid to ask for an A+. I did not do that (as I was not planning on law school), and I regret doing it. A lot of professors don’t think of it/it is not standard policy for the school but could be happy to give you one.

**LSAT:**

There are a lot of posts of people detailing how they approached the LSAT, so my only input here is to focus on what works for you. Whatever allows you to feel like you are best using your time is the way you should approach studying. You know you.

**Essays:**

*Personal Statement*

I highly recommend reading the prompts for every single school you apply to. While a generic “why law?” will work for most schools, make sure that there is a prompt that fits what your essay is answering and, if necessary, modify your personal statement to better fit a certain prompt.

If you choose to mention “wanting to help people” in your personal statement, try to have a more precise reason than just “making the world a better place” or “improving people’s lives.” Having a real-world example of you doing an engaging in an activity related to some form of betterment is a great way to specify the impact you want to have.

Have at least one person who knows what law schools are looking for (e.g.., applied to law school recently, applying to law school now, so-called admissions experts) read your essay. What a law school is looking for from a personal statement is not what an undergraduate or some other graduate institutions seek. If you can have more than one set of eyes, great. I do think you may run into a problem of too many cooks in the kitchen if you have a lot of people editing your essay. I had three people read my personal statement, and I think that was the right amount, but I would say the vast majority of progress was made working closely with my friend who recently applied to law school.

Use your voice. A genuine essay that reads like a real person with real thoughts and real dreams comes off so much stronger than a robotic recitation of your accomplishments. As a splitter, this is your chance to highlight some facet of you that law schools will miss out on, which can help compensate for a sub-par GPA.

*Diversity Statement* 

I am a straight cis white male, and I wrote a diversity statement. I think it was my strongest (or second-strongest) essay. You have a unique story to tell that no one else can tell in the way you do. Gender, race, and sexuality are amazing aspects of your being to highlight, but I don’t want someone to think they can’t or shouldn’t write a diversity statement because they exist as a power-holder through those lenses. 

*Supplements (Why X?)*

I used to think that you should write a Why X about aspects of the school that matched your interests, but I came to understand that the purpose of these is to show how you fit what the school is seeking. To better understand what individual schools sought, I went to events, read online materials, and talked to students and alumni of these institutions. This understanding helped me tremendously - not every school has an angle that they are looking for, but some (e.g., UVA, UMich) definitely do, and it is to your advantage to play into that. Not all schools seek that narrowly, though. Many have broad programs and offerings - tying your experience to these is a great way to show how you would engage as a student there. Schools seek students with diverse interests, and your Why X is an opportunity to show your interests would fit well there.

If you can get someone who either got admitted or, much preferably, is/was a student at the school, I think there is a slight boost there. This hypothetical person likely has a better understanding of what the school looks for in students. That’s not to say to not use your friend who’s an amazing editor because they didn’t get into Y school, but if you are able to get someone with that tie to a school to read your stuff over, I don’t think it can hurt.

For non-Why X? supplements, my advice is to make sure that it is not simply rephrasing what you say in your personal or diversity statement. Every piece of writing you submit should say something a little different about you.

**Recommenders:**

A great piece of advice I got is to tell your recommender what you want them to say about you. When asking them for an LOR, say \*why\* you chose this person to be your recommender. Don’t literally tell them exactly what you want them to say, but hint towards the aspects of your experience with this person that you want them to highlight. 90%+ of the time, the person writing the LOR for you wants you to succeed. It also can help your recommender better tailor their letter and reduce narrative repetition.

Please check every school’s instructions for what they are looking for from a LOR. Many times, they lay out exactly what they are looking for from recommenders. When you are deciding what combination of academic and professional to use, showing you read all the instructions can’t hurt your application. 

Yale: “We strongly prefer letters from at least two professors with whom you have studied who can speak to your academic performance and who have had a chance to personally evaluate significant aspects of your academic work.”

Columbia: “We require applicants currently in school or recently graduated (i.e., applying within less than approximately two years of receiving their degree) to submit two academic letters from faculty who can provide insight about their candidacy.

…*.* Applicants with substantive work experience who are not recent graduates are strongly encouraged to submit one professional letter and at least one academic letter of recommendation.”

Duke: “Unless you have been out of school for some time, at least one letter should come from an academic instructor who has personal knowledge of your performance and potential. A second letter should come from someone who can address your professional and work-related accomplishments, interpersonal skills, leadership, and involvement, such as a supervisor or advisor from a job, internship, or student organization ... If you have been out of school for long enough that an academic reference is not available, you may submit an employment letter in its place.”

Fordham: “Letters from current or former professors are preferred. If you graduated five or more years ago, professional letters are acceptable.”

As someone who had a mix (2 academic, 2 professional) of LORs, using the language the school gave me was a critical factor in determining the combination I would submit. I never submitted more than three LORs to one school and only one professional at most. I got advice from some people I hold in high regard when it comes to admissions that you should not submit more than one professional LOR unless you have significant (8+ years or so) work experience.

If you are going to submit three or four LORs, try to ensure that they are strong letters and are not repetitive of one another. Don’t submit two supervisors who know you in practically the same capacity. 

*Academic LORs*

If you’re in school, please secure your academic LORs while you are on campus. I did not, and believe I lost out on some strong advocates for my cause because I waited until over a year after I graduated to ask for LORs.

If you are able to connect with a professor outside of the classroom, their letter for you often becomes even stronger. Going to office hours, helping out with their research, putting on events where they speak, or even offering to get coffee are great ways to get to know your professors better and let them get to know you better.

If you’re out of school, I would recommend scheduling a Zoom call (or coffee chat if you’re near them) to catch up with the professor and ask them for a recommendation face-to-face. It shows a degree of effort beyond simply asking for one over email, which can help them write a stronger letter for you. You can also get the opportunity to remind them of the classes you took with them and answer any questions they may have. The same goes for professional LORs — your boss knowing what projects you worked on that you want them to highlight or a certain skill you think they could speak well to is very unlikely to hurt your application and much, much more likely to help. 

I don’t have any other specific advice for professional LORs besides what I highlighted above re: the combination of the two.

**Resume/Work Experience:**

You should work.

Unless there is some outside circumstance forcing you to go to law school immediately after undergrad, going to work at a job provides some clear benefits:

* Helps your application. More and more every year, law schools are preferring applicants with work experience. 
* $$$$ - law school is expensive, so it is nice to have some savings before you even get to campus.
* If it is a legal role, you get insights into what legal work is actually like.
* I heard from quite a few people that working can help you prepare for the stress of law school. I am not 100% sure on this, but many people do say this, so it’s worth noting. 
* I think working makes you a more mature and responsible person. Bonus points if it’s a high-stress workplace (legal, finance, consulting, etc.), as I think being able to maintain calm during a storm is a valuable skill for applying to law school. 

As a splitter, you want to maximize every aspect of your application that is not your low point. Working is advantageous to not working for the purpose of getting into law school, not even considering the other benefits. If your goal is to get into the best law school for your dreams you possibly can, work. I know I am going to be a better law student this fall than I would have been as a KJD.

*Resume*

I used a pretty common template for my resume. Whatever template or format you use, make sure it looks professional - there are plenty of great examples that law schools post online, and I highly recommend checking them out (Harvard - [https://hls.harvard.edu/application-toolkit/resume/](https://hls.harvard.edu/application-toolkit/resume/) ). Your resume obviously needs to be error-free and should demonstrate to a law school that you are someone who is going to be hirable on the job market. 

Much like with essays, I recommend getting another set of eyes on your resume. As you hopefully saw with the Harvard examples above, what a law school resume is looking for is not exactly what a professional resume looks like. For me, I went deeper into my extracurricular “leadership” experiences than I would have in a professional resume. Having someone who went through this process recently or has some general knowledge about it is extra helpful, but simply having another person make sure everything looks good is worth it.

**Interviews:**

I recommend checking out the questions published online before you go into an interview. If you have a response in mind for a question, it can help tremendously. Now, I would not recommend rehearsing a response to the point it sounds like you’re reading from a teleprompter. A canned, inauthentic response makes you come off as mechanical the same way a ChatGPT-written essay would.

**Tactics:**

Try to apply as early as you can. For some schools (UVA, Duke), there are well-known “unofficial” deadlines for many applicants. As a splitter, you cannot risk an admissions counselor thinking, “Oh we need an applicant with a higher X for our class” because they already filled up too much of the class. I applied in mid-October (outside of HYSC which I did not see a chance for myself at), and I probably should have gotten them out a little earlier. If you’re aiming for t14, I would really try to have your applications out by November 1. Now - do not sacrifice quality for the sake of timeliness. If you are not confident in your materials, you should take the time needed to read them over and make sure they are ready. One extra day will not make the difference between admission and denial.

Be authentic. I emphasized this a little in the essay part, but you should only try to be yourself on a law school application, not something you think an admissions officer wants to see. I had no plans of going to law school during undergrad, and I think that helped my application, as I was able to explore interesting classes and extracurriculars that I may not have been able to otherwise had I forced myself to try to fit into some template. Tell your story, not the story that you think someone else wants to read. The only person who can tell your story completely is you.

Read over all of your application materials for every app. I did this and caught some missed questions/typos/responses I want to modify. It does not take that long to proofread a law school application, and frankly, attention to detail is a good skill for an attorney to have.

I decided to not apply to HYS until I applied to schools I was more likely to get into. I think this did help me with non-HYS but also may have hurt my chances with HYS, which I thought were pretty low. If I could do it again, I would do the same thing.

March 10 2024
This Hookup was wayy different than my usual ones. It's always cafe or a Drive for the first date, but this Chick said let's go to watch a Play. Wicked the musical, based on the Movie Wicked. 

Soon as the room went dark, our hands started grabbing each other. We were in the last row and we took full benifit of it. Soon as the play ended we cancelled our reservation to a Koren hot pot. She loved her kimchi even though she was Aussie 

Instead we went over to Hers, as her place was closer. As soon as we reached her apartment, we ordered takeaway and we made out on her couch until the delivery arrived. 

I was visibly turned onn but  after food arrived we watched something silly and ate. 

THEN came the tub of ice cream for desert, after a few spoonfuls she decided to top my dick off with vanilla Ice cream. 

I wasn't complaining, the way I see it. 
She had her mouth full of vanilla ice cream with brownie. 

She sucked me off on that couch. 
Which really turned me on, 
Picked her up and took her to the bed. 

I knew she liked it rough from our conversations before, so I just tore her night top to get a look at her tits. They were perky, handful and had big aerolas. They were beautiful 

I was kissing and biting her neck and boobs. Suffice to say I left a few dark hickes  on her neck and chest. 

I even went down on her and she was calling my name all the while I was down there, she would grab my hair with both her hands and her thighs wrapped around me, I was Groping her boobs and testing her clit with my tongue at the same time. 

Then she pulled me up and still remember what she whispered in my ear while breathing heavily "" take me, I'm yours"" 

That's all I needed to hear. 

So I took the leather belt off my unzipped pants, strapped her hands together with it.
And I told her "" you're my slut now"" 

There's something i can't quite describe about rough sex which is really satisfying. 
In our chats we had spoken about how we're going to use protection and how we'll play it safe if we do end hooking up. 

But that night none of us mentioned having a condom. The truth is I wanted to take her raw and she wanted my cum inside her. And we did just that! I spent the entire night at her place, we made breakfast together which was really peanut butter toast and coffee
It was a great night and we met a few times after that too until she moved to Canberra.

For centuries, you've been told that secret societies preserve ancient wisdom, that mystical orders guard transformative knowledge, that occult traditions offer pathways to transcendence.

This is the most sophisticated lie ever constructed.

**THE OCCULT DECEPTION** reveals how every major secret society, mystical movement, and consciousness development program operates as systematic exploitation of your neurological vulnerabilities disguised as spiritual development.

**What You'll Discover:**

* How Freemasonry's ""ancient"" traditions were fabricated in 18th-century France
* Why Rosicrucian ""mysteries"" were deliberate literary hoaxes that metastasized into global movements
* How orphanages became loyalty factories that processed vulnerable children into lifelong institutional dependency
* Why your pattern-recognition systems automatically generate mystical significance from deliberate symbolic manipulation
* How consciousness itself became a commodity that requires professional development and ongoing maintenance
* Why integration mythology prevents you from recognizing systematic manipulation as authentic development

This isn't about exposing corruption within pure systems. This is about recognizing that corruption IS the system—designed to exploit your desperate need for meaning-frameworks, tribal belonging, and transcendent hallucinations.

**The apparatus doesn't satisfy your meaning-generation compulsions. It weaponizes your meaning-generation compulsions.**

I'm about 7 weeks 2 days right now. My symptoms (sore nipples, heavy feeling in pelvis, bloating) were somewhat reduced yesterday, and this morning they are all gone. Whoof. I feel totally 100% normal/not pregnant. 

I haven't been able to stomach coffee for the past three weeks, so I poured myself a coffee this morning in the hopes that the gut rot and nausea would reassure me, and of course I feel just fine an hour after the coffee. 

I'm not cramping, I'm not bleeding, I know I don't have any major flags to suggest I could need medical attention or an imminent loss, but I'm just feeling so overwhelmingly sad and worried today. My first OB appointment isn't for another week, and they told me not to expect an ultrasound until 11 or 12 weeks. I have not had any betas or anything - just good progression at home on pregnancy tests, which included a strong positive yesterday. 

I have a history of one loss, but my last pregnancy was successful. It was long enough ago that I don't recall what my symptoms were like around this time.

1l4r951,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRBSnarkBU/comments/1l4r951/gypsy_and_her_cycle_of_abuse/,Gypsy and her cycle of abuse,"This recent hair spiral she had felt eerily familiar. It’s almost like she’s running the abuse cycle with the public. Has anyone else noticed this? She gets called out for shitty behavior. She denies, deflects and argues. That doesn’t work, so she lashes out, getting really nasty, deploying the by proxies and hits way below the belt. Then comes back with a half hearted apology and many many expressions of how she’s going to grow and be a better person and everyone makes mistakes. There’s a short period where her online activity is inane. Then she gets called out again and the cycle continues. 

As I was mulling this over in my head, I realized a few things. First, her “honeymoon” periods where she’s on her best behavior are getting shorter and shorter. It’s less than a month, or roughly that, since her spiral over Ryan. It had been pretty quiet before this. Prior to this, it was the manic dancing, Ken is away on a trip incident. Before that, I think it was the hairbrush??? So it seems the good periods are becoming shorter and she’s having breakthrough incidents in between where she doesn’t completely spiral, but she’s definitely testing the waters. 

The second thing was comparing the hair incident with the Ryan incident. It all starts with her doing something over the top, clearly looking for gratification and ass pats. Doing self care videos, going the gym when she’s sick, and buying and using hair dye products. Acting like she’s a MH professional, got it all together mom or a pro stylist. Then it backfires in some way. The first 24 hours she makes some random comments on SM. The backlash doesn’t stop. Proceeds with the manic, angry posting on SM occurs. This happens for a day or two. After that portion is over, maybe 3-4 days after the original incident, she posts some BS apology, then a second within 24 hours. The second goes further in depth, but is still BS. We saw this with the Ryan incident and now the hair care incident. Less than 24 hours after this, she posts something about MH or something else making her the victim or giving an excuse to her behavior. Then multiple posts about “a new day” or growing and being a better person. This goes on for a few days. Then it’s right back into the cycle. 

Has anyone else noticed this? It’s really odd. I think it all starts with her already primed to have a meltdown. Almost like that’s her end goal. “Oh I’m gonna dye my hair because I need attention”. Then she lets it simmer for a bit. Escalates her behavior. Then she posts more than one apology, swiftly followed by her deflection posts and BS nonsense about everyone making mistakes. Her period of excessive anger seem to be much longer than the rest. And the Ryan incident, she was already complaining that Ken wasn’t taking care of her like he should when she was sick. The manic posting of dance videos happened while Ken was away for the weekend. Maybe she knows she can’t lash out at Ken, so she looks for attention in other places, then takes that seething anger out on the public. 

Are we, the audience, the abused spouse here? You’d think she’s learned by now she can’t control the public, yet she keeps trying. Maybe it’s easier for her to fight with strangers on the internet than people in her immediate circle. Like she has to try and hold up the mask with them, so she takes it off for strangers instead.

Back in March, I got this plant as a gift and was told it was a ""pepper plant"" and ""very easy to care for."" I had my doubts but did not verify that info, just took care of it the same as I do for my other plants (I've got Pothos, common ivy, coffee plant, Ficus, Schefflera Compacta \[which has been a pain but it's still alive and doing very well despite its moods\], and Tetrastigma Voinierianum among others and so I thought ""this one can't be more needy than all those I've got ."" Well, I was wrong). 

Month after month, the new plant began to lose leaves and even entire branches. From a Google search, I have suspicions that the plant is Operculicarya decaryi (Elephant Tree) as the leaves seem to match, but when I got it in March, it looked nothing like the ones I see pics of online (it was way more like a bush with many, many leaves). The temp inside has been stable, never less than 20C - and circa 25-27C degrees since a week ago as summer approaches.  I tried watering less, watering more, using plant food and fertilizer, and moving it from a place further from sunlight to semi-direct sunlight, but there were no effects; the plant seems to be dying constantly. I keep my plants in indirect sunlight most of the time (they stand opposite a window that faces east, so they get direct sunlight these days only for about 2-3h after sunrise)

gulo2 nyo"" tapos kinompronta ko naman sya ng maayos at nag respond din sya ng maayos pero dama ko yung pagka taray nya tapos usap kami konte ng maayos kanina at humingi ako ng mga litrato sa kanya nung kami pa pero di nya binigay sabi nya ""u did what u did so panindigan mo"" so ayun isang litrato nalang ang nasa akin, litrato nya na kinuha ko nung una kong punta sa workplace nya pero hanggang ngayon sa profiles nya IG at FB may mga litrato padin sa highlights nya na may clue about sa akin even relationship status nya still married and naging visible sa kanyang profile even sa tiktok nya makikita parin sa background nya yung mga letters, bulaklak, at photo booth kung ano man ang mga binigay ko sa kanya in short she still do open doors and not doing healthy closure.

I’m child-free and looking for something real — long-term, intentional, and leading to marriage. I want a partner who’s emotionally available, a little romantic, and not afraid to spoil his woman (don’t worry, I give just as much love as I crave 😉).

I dream of welcoming you home with a kiss on the porch, hugging you from behind in the kitchen, and falling asleep tangled up together after a night of talking about everything and nothing. I want a love that feels soft, safe, and exciting all at once.

1l4r3lb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4r3lb,Rant about BAYAR'S COFFEE.,"So I ordered an 80-20 blend from bayars for espresso about a month ago.  Pre ground . The process went really smooth, no issues at all. Delivery was on time, taste was nice. This time I thought I'll order 100%arabica. I make the payment, order is confirmed. This is on 27th may. Now there is simply no sign of any order processing happening at all. Since 27th , till now (6/6/26), everyday tracking shows that order is out for pickup in the morning. But at night it shows pickup cancelled. 
I have been in touch with since day 2-3. And everytime they are saying same thing. That as per our own website tracking it will get delivered on 6/6/25. Even today,their site only shoes that order is out for pickup. There's no way they can ship from Karnataka to haryana on same day. 
I feel really frustrated and somewhat cheated and also sad. After repeated messages that are not cancelling the order.  No sign of tracking, no refund, no cancellation. Only stuck

1l4r3in,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1l4r3in/a_coffee_experience_i_witnessed_firsthand/,A coffee experience I witnessed firsthand,"So I served 20 years in the Air Force, and this story is from 1996. We were an atypical unit, where our mission was always deployed. Not airframe related at all, but rather, like the Army. We all trained with multiple weapons, we trained in convoy protocols, we set up our equipment and covered it all with camouflage netting, we dug our own foxholes, we pulled out own security, etc., (you get the idea). All of this was as a self supporting unit, all designed to be operated outside any base if need be. We had about 250 people at any given time, and like any unit, not everyone took it seriously. This story happened on the first three days of a deployment to Denmark for a NATO Partnership For Peace Exercise when meant a 2-day convoys from our base. I didn’t participate directly, but I heard firsthand from those who did as it was happening and heard and saw the fallout (which wasn’t severe but it was very satisfying) for myself.

I worked Radar Maintenance, and after all hands went on deck for our equipment setup on a cliff overlooking the North Sea, we split into two 12-hour shifts for the rest of the deployment. I had known A, a Senior Airman, who outranked me, since we were both in Technical School three years prior, and this assignment was our second assignment, and it was nice to have a friend in the new unit, especially since it was my first deployment. We were both on night shift,  as was A”s girlfriend (and future wife), K. K wasn’t in our workcenter, but whenever A and K had free time, they were together. We came off shift and hit breakfast, and K was complaining about getting reamed at shift change. Now K’s supervisor was a somewhat crusty Master Sergeant, V., and apparently he expected coffee to be ready by the time he arrived. 

Now most of us in the service love coffee… we NEED coffee! The 6 of us working nights in our workcenter went through 1 & 1/2 30 cup percolators a night. Like, if ever read a Jack Reacher book, his coffee preferences was exactly what it was like. The problem was K and the one coworker she had on nights didn’t drink coffee. So they didn’t think of making it, and they also didn’t think they should have to make coffee for someone else when they got zero benefit. So that first breakfast after our night shifts began, they decided they would maliciously comply with MSgt V’s “order” to have coffee ready when he came on shift.

The next night, they intentionally used the amount of coffee for a standard drip pot you’d use at home, despite every workcenter having the same 30-cup percolators. So when shift change happened, the first thing MSgt V said was “You batter have coffee ready!”, and they both nodded and gave a “Yes sir!” and walked out the door, knowing they made the weakest brown water tea that would be considered undrinkable, and it would take another fifteen minutes of anger-induced waiting by MSgt V to have a decent cup of joe, that he’d still have to make himself. Both A and myself were laughing when they relayed this to us at breakfast. 

That afternoon at shift change, MSgt V tore into K and her coworker, and she came over to vent to A as soon as V was off shift. Apparently he raged about half of his 12-hour shift, because a couple different people on day shift told K how angry and grumpy V was. Well K told us he yelled loud enough that others came to see if there was a fight once she told V they weren’t coffee drinkers so they didn’t know how to use a percolator. He ended his second reaming with “FIGURE IT OUT!” and stomped off. After venting, and a hug & kiss from A, K said she’d make him “a stronger pot of coffee” with a much different smile than her normal one. It didn’t look sarcastic, but it was twice as big as normal and I realized she was going to enjoy what she was going to do. So she went and filled the percolator basket to the brim with coffee, and turned it on. THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF A 12 HOUR SHIFT! And as soon as it finished, she unplugged it and took it outside, and took the top off to cool in the chilly North Sea nighttime air. Once it was room temperature, she refilled the basket to the brim, put the lid on, and took it inside to restart the percolator using the coffee that was already in it. She got four cycles in that night, in between her duties (which were minimal, as her system was rather new and much less labor intensive than ours, and we were using our night shift to train us new guys, so we had much less free time).

A and I found ourselves outside at shift change, on purpose. We found a way to make ourselves busy and let the others do the shift briefing. About a minute or two after MSgt V arrived, you could hear the faint shouting from across the dirt road and patch of field that separated our workcenter from the rest of the squadron. Two minutes later K and her coworker walked out with their heads down, and after about 20 paces turned to see if anyone was still watching, then they started laughing hard enough to notice from just their silhouettes in the morning sun rising behind them. k came running to us and I stepped back and let her tell A the story, which her coworker again relayed to me at breakfast. Here it is, still etched in my mind nearly 30 years later.

MSgt V practically kicked in the door to the 580 shelter that functioned as their mobile workcenter. He immediately went to the coffee pot and scowled “This better be stronger than yesterday”. K just replied “It should be” and turned to walk about before being angrily told “Wait!”. She was actually happy that he was already mad. He took a styrofoam cup and poured a dark black cup of coffee that looked like motor oil pouring out of an engine block that was several thousand miles past due for its change. It even had a faint burnt smell. V let out a “What’s this?” and took a sip and turned and sputtered it out of his mouth, out the still open door of the shelter. Well, most of it went out the door, but some dribbled out and hit his uniform short and pants. Good thing brown is one of the woodland camouflage colors. He raged for half a minute and stomped back and opened to coffee percolator to see the grounds practically overflowing basket. He raged some more about wasting resources, to ordered them out of his sight before he could do something he’d regret. After they walked out the door he took his cup to toss out the undrinkable coffee, and raged again and the amount of grounds at the bottom. And he still had to wait another fifteen minutes to get a drinkable cup of joe. We were well outside the exercise wire before he could enjoy it. 

Well, A and I were back outside as soon the shift briefing ended that afternoon, waiting for K to come share the full fallout. Apparently MSgt V dropped the coffee percolator trying to empty it, and was so made he didn’t speak the rest of his shift until the afternoon shaft change briefing. But he told K and her coworker not to bother making coffee. She said good thing, because she had a fiber laxative she was going to put in the pot if she had to make it one more time. She said it with that same smile she had the first morning that made me decide I didn’t want to get on her bad side. They all made up about it later, and MSgt K even laughed about it during the post-deployment BBQ the night before we packed up to convoy home. K made sure she kept his beer stein full all night though, so it probably helped his mood. ",67,1749212740.0,MaliciousCompliance,18,0.89,False
1l4r1f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstonMartin/comments/1l4r1f2/dbx_maintenance/,DBX maintenance,"Picture this, you’ve gone and bought yourself an Aston Martin DBX, that glorious slab of British opulence masquerading as an SUV. It’s all very James Bond—sleek, powerful, and probably parked outside your local Waitrose looking like it’s ready to outrun a Spectre henchman. But then comes the kicker: the service bill. Oh, dear Lord, the official Aston Martin service. They’ll have you believe it’s the only way to keep your DBX purring like a contented lion, but let’s be honest—it’s a wallet-shredding, bank-account-obliterating exercise in fleecing you for every penny you’ve got. And for what? A car that’s depreciating faster than a politician’s credibility.

Now, I’m not saying the chaps at the official Aston service centres aren’t talented. They probably polish the spark plugs with silk handkerchiefs and whisper sweet nothings to the engine bay. But do you *really* need to fork over the price of a small hatchback just to have your oil changed by someone in an Aston-branded polo shirt? No, you don’t. A good local mechanic—yes, the one with the slightly grubby overalls and a toolbox older than your nan—can do the job just as well for a fraction of the cost. These lads know their way around a car. They’ve been elbow-deep in engines since before the DBX was even a sketch on some designer’s napkin. Brake pads? Sorted. Oil change? Done. Air filter? They’ll swap it out faster than you can say “007.”

And let’s talk about that depreciation for a moment. The DBX, magnificent though it is, sheds value like a Labrador in a heatwave. You’re not driving an investment; you’re driving a very expensive way to lose money. So why, in the name of all that’s holy, would you compound that financial carnage by splurging thousands on an official service? It’s like buying a Gucci suit and then paying a tailor to iron it with gold-plated steam. Madness! Your local garage, with its no-nonsense approach and a kettle that’s always on, will keep your DBX ticking over just fine. They might not have a fancy waiting room with artisanal coffee, but they’ll get the job done without making your bank manager weep.

So, save your cash. Take your DBX to a trusted local mechanic who’ll treat it with the respect it deserves, not the reverence it doesn’t need. Because at the end of the day, it’s a car, not a Fabergé egg. And when you’re bombing down the motorway, cackling at the glorious roar of that V8, you won’t care whether it was serviced in a marble-floored Aston dealership or Dave’s Garage down the road.

**CHAPTER 3: Past Mistakes**



The morning of the 29th of October Mymy Schoppenboer woke up feeling amazing, she had taken careful steps the previous week planning her escapade with Kiki. She picked up her phone and was about to text Kiki to get ready to make history (in both senses). But then seeing their last conversation from last night made her smile fade… Right, she told her the plans are cancelled, and Kiki was mad at her for this. Mymy recalled the events of yesterday, the shock of her sisters physically assaulting each other, Coco cursing and yelling at her, and the discussion her family had last night. She really wanted this plan to come to fruition, but somehow all her energy got zapped away, she couldn’t explain how or why she felt like this.



She got up, stretched and yawned. She decided it was better to get breakfast, maybe she could indulge in some stroopwafels behind her mom’s back. She opened her door and peeked outside Maya and Coco didn’t appear to have left their rooms although with Maya that was almost always a given, but Coco would already be greeting and hugging her.



“Good morning sweetie.” Mymy was startled by the sudden appearance of her mother at the top of the stairs, who followed with a quick kiss on her forehead.



“Good morning mom.” Mymy replied. “Hey uhm… are Coco and Maya downstairs?” and she tried to follow up.



“Why? Is something wrong?” Soei felt the need to ask, making a worried face made Mymy a little uncomfortable.



“No no, I just… you know… hoped everything was alright” Mymy said while looking to her side.



“Everything’s… fine for now, your sisters are grounded and won’t go to school today.” Soei replied while turning her head towards the doors of the girls. Mymy frowned at this. “You better get ready for school sweetie, I made you pancakes, and please don’t eat any stroopwafel, I already know you took some last night.” 



The news that her sisters were grounded after their fight didn't come as a shock for Mymy, Coco did hit Maya pretty hard, she could only get glimpses of Maya’s face but she saw her right eye was darker than usual and swollen as well as having a small bandage on her nose. The image of Maya bleeding coming back to her head made her shudder, she quickly went downstairs instead of remembering as she still wanted to eat breakfast.



Mymy saw her plate waiting for her, her father was on the opposite side of the plate drinking a cup of coffee. They said good morning to each other, Soei came down shortly after she sat in front of Mymy watching her eat thinking of what else she was missing from her daughters. She then turned to Ravi and gave a small nod. Mymy saw her mother and looked at her with mild worry.



“Mom… what’s wrong?” Mymy questioned.



“Mymy… I need you to tell me something.” Soei replied looking downward with Ravi joining her on the chair next to her. “Has Coco also hit you or threatened you?”



Mymy swallowed her pancakes, caught off guard by the question. 



“Uhm…” She looked at her mother and father, and then to her plate again.



“Has she?” Soei asked out of worry.



“No, no! I mean…” Mymy looked around for the right words in her mind. “She has thrown papers at me or warned me whenever I do something weird or I get us in trouble, but outside of that… no?” 



“And… Do you *feel* threatened by her?” Ravi followed up.



Mymy looked down, thinking, does she? She’s always been cordial and friendly with her, showing her love every time she can, playing games together, spending time together, she can’t say she doesn’t have good memories with Coco. But… there was…



“Mymy?” Soei said.



“Uhm… There *was* this one time that…” Mymy tried to get her words out. “I may have talked about her parents too…”



Soei and Ravi frowned at this.



“Let me explain, ok!” Mymy defended herself. “It was when we were like… 7 I think…”



“We were making snowmen in the winter, everything was great, while you two were helping Maya with something Coco and I were alone, so to make conversation I asked if it snowed in South Africa.” Mymy recalled.  “Coco said it wasn’t common, she never got to experience it with her parents. She had a very sad expression when she said it, but… I didn't pick up on it and asked why…” Mymy cringed at the next part.  “Coco then told me that her family didn't get the opportunity for that. And I *still* didn’t pick up on it. **so**, I said…”



*“Huh, well… You're lucky you're living with us now, you can enjoy all this snow now.”* Mymy slowed her speech down with each word as her parents' expressions changed. “And well… Coco got mad and she pushed me and destroyed our snowman and went back to you and Maya…” Mymy looked down at her feet. “Yeeeeeep…”



“I mean… I don’t blame Coco. This was before you told me about her parents.” Mymy continued. “She apologized for that incident and gave me a hug and stroopwafels.”



Soei and Ravi looked at each other, shocked that this pattern of sensitivity that Coco has with her biological family had existed for so long, they barely talked about it with her, feeling it unnecessary and seeing as Coco was happy made them not worry.



“And what about Maya?” Ravi asked. 



“Well, you know… she’s Maya.” Mymy replied while fidgeting with her hands. “We are fine with each other…” Mymy saw her parents weren’t fully convinced by this statement. “Ask her if you don’t believe me.”



“So uhm… I think I’ll go get ready for school now…” Mymy said as she got out of her seat and went to the bathroom, looking back at her parents until she closed the door.



“Ravi…” Soei said. “Why didn’t we know any of this? Why didn’t we notice this?”



Ravi had a defeated look. “I don’t know… Maybe we just weren’t paying enough attention…”



Ravi then looked at his watch, he sighed because he was running late… but he didn’t want to leave his wife at that moment, but knew he had to. “I’m sorry my love, but I need to go, call me when you get to the huisarts, or if anything else happens alright?” 



Soei nodded, after a goodbye kiss Ravi went out the door, he had to take a train this time as Soei needed the car for today. She sighed, ran her hands through her face and took a deep breath, she then picked up Mymy’s plate and went to the kitchen.



Unknown to all three of them, Coco was sitting with her back against the handrails of the stairs. She had heard the entire conversation, she felt guilt and was about to cry again. If not for Maya suddenly opening her door the sisters then locked eyes and frowned at each other, Maya closed her door. Coco got up, shook her head and headed downstairs.



“Good morning, mom” Coco said while not looking at her mother’s direction. Soei turned and gave her daughter a warm smile.



“Good morning, sweetheart,” Soei replied. “I made pancakes.”



“Thank you…” Coco still looked dejected.



“Has Maya gotten up yet?” Soei dared to ask, looking at Coco.



“I don’t know…” Coco made a small frown when hearing Maya’s name.



“Then I’ll go wake her up.” Soei sighed, picked up some pancakes on a plate and went upstairs.



Coco started eating her breakfast, but stopped once she saw Mymy get out of the bathroom, already dressed and ready for school. The sisters looked at each other and didn’t say anything, Mymy broke the ice by waving half heartedly and smiling at her sister, Coco reciprocated.



Mymy went upstairs to get her backpack and say goodbye to her mother.



Coco then recalled Mymy’s conversation with their parents, does Mymy actually feel threatened by her? But she’s done everything right, the snowman incident was just a one-time thing, and she apologized for that too! And her parents' questioning made her feel worse, do they think she’s some kind of bully?

Coco was too preoccupied with her thoughts that she never noticed Mymy leaving the house.



Upstairs, Soei knocked on Maya’s door and after not getting a response she opened the door, Maya hid her phone as soon as she heard her mother.



“Maya.” Soei said softly. “Good morning.”



“Hi…” Maya let out a weak response.



“I made you breakfast… it’s pancakes” Soei tried to make her daughter comfortable.



Soei put the plate and fork next to Maya and sat beside her daughter. Maya didn’t move for a minute, she looked at her mother, Soei noticed her eye was still swollen.



“Have you put on the ice pack?” Soei asked.



“No…” Maya asked while looking away.



The mother and daughter stayed silent for a while. “Maya…” Soei spoke up. “I need you to tell me something, and be honest with me.” Maya waited for her next words.



“Mymy told me and your dad about… an incident she also had with Coco.” Maya turned to her mother in surprise. “When you were 7 Mymy accidentally insulted her family and made her upset.”



Maya didn’t know how to feel about this information, she again felt validation for her parents finally seeing that Coco had flaws, but she also felt bad because at least Mymy did it without meaning any insult, where does that leave her?



“Have you seen them be aggressive towards each other?” Soei asked her daughter. Maya looked to the side trying to think of another incident. And outside of that incident and Coco trying to stop Mymy’s exploits, they actually seem to love each other. This made Maya angry at them for actually giving a damn when it doesn’t involve her, she then shook her head responding to her mother.



“Alright, that’s good to know.” Soei replied. “And what about you and Mymy? Is there anything I should know about?”



Maya thought for a second, remembering the times Mymy would laugh at her or mock her shortcomings or try to “help” and just make things worse for her. She wondered if she even likes Mymy, she’s loud, childish,  egocentric and… just sad… She never understood her need to dye her hair and wear those silly contact lenses, does she really hate herself that much?



“Maya?” Soei looked worried at her daughter's silence.



“She’s Mymy… at this point you know how it is with her…” Maya’s words didn't put her at ease.



“Alright… eat your breakfast and get ready to go out, we're leaving in 40 minutes.” Soei said after a minute of silence, she then got up and left Maya's room, closing the door behind her.



Maya only ate one pancake before feeling guilt again, and left the rest on her desk. Soei was about to go downstairs but then turned and saw the picture frames of her daughters. She focused on Maya’s seeing her gradually lose her sweet smile. Soei thought to herself that maybe indeed she has not been paying enough attention.

1l4qz7g,https://countyfencemagazine.com/reason-11-tim-hortons/,Reason Greater Napanee is Greater #11: Tim Hortons - County Fence Bi-Annual,"Greater Napanee is greater for many reasons and #11 is our downtown Tim Hortons! That’s right! You may not realize it but back in 1993 Tim Horton’s coffee was an urban drink and Napanee showed that rural communities could have it too! Belleville got store #13 and Kingston got store #15 but those are big urban centres. It was only when we went to the city that we got our double-double just like on “Royal Canadian Air Farce.” But Napanee showed small communities everywhere that they deserved fancy coffee too.

 Napanee got store #741 which means Tim Hortons built 103 stores before getting to number #844 in Picton. Communities like Bath and Yarker are still waiting on their Tim’s and Wellington, despite being full of fancy city people, only gets a Tim’s attached to a gas station. You’re welcome, Picton! High five!

My first time going to the Napanee Tim Hortons was in 1994 with my boyfriend Dwayne. We were going to go fishing in his boat and wanted to get breakfast. We thought: why not try Tim’s? We got large double-doubles and I got a Boston cream donut and he got an apple fritter. It was delicious and not just because it was Tim’s but because it was our Tim’s. Dwayne had never been through a drive-thru before and he almost got the boat stuck on the speaker. It was a good thing it was light because we could just get out and lift it.

I remember sitting in the front of the boat skimming across the water as the sun came out, drinking that coffee, and feeling so luxurious. I have aged like fine wine but let me tell you that I was beautiful that day. I remember watching Dwayne as he piloted the boat out of the river, his long hair blowing in the wind and his moustache looking very handsome. In those days men wore jean jackets with the arms cut off and it made him look so strong and masculine. He was almost as handsome as Bryan Adams. I just wanted him to cuddle me but I knew he was looking at me too and it was the Tim’s that kept me from wrapping myself in a blanket. I know Dwayne was very happy for that!

It was one of the most romantic dates I have ever been on. We caught three pickerel and Dwayne even caught a giant catfish. It was so scary and I know it was one of God’s creatures but Dwayne protected me anyway with one of his empty beer bottles. Even today his chivalry makes me quiver. Let me tell you that fish is not all Duane caught that day! But I can’t tell you any more or things would get pretty steamy!

I love Tim Hortons. It is so nice that premium coffee chains want to support small towns too. A few years ago another fancy city coffee chain came to town, I think it was called fragrance or something. They’re closed now. I was sad that they closed but that’s what they get for competing with Tim’s. It’s too good and let’s not forget that it’s Canada’s coffee shop! I am so glad that we could lead the way for small places like Madoc and even international locations like Watertown to have great coffee too.

This is probably the most fascinating thing to me of all things Mormonism. No matter how wicked and evil sex and sexuality are made out to be, Mormons are still ilicitly sexing. The amount of youth and young adults we were hearing about going through a repentance process, having to wait to go on a mission, having to get married, or the amount of affairs that happened; is sort of staggering. The same rate, if not more, among the ""Gentiles.""  Even in my wife's own family.  (My wife is 1 of 6 siblings and 4 of the 6 have cheated or been cheated on by their new and ever lasting covenant spouse. We won't even go into extended family - aunts, uncles, counsins, and etc.)  I wonder if that's why things like the Word of Wisdom and Tithing are so heavily fixated on by Mormons. They feel like shitty human beings for having natural sexual urges but hey.........""I've never had coffee and I pay a full tithe. Jesus loves me!!!!"" I recall getting the side eye from a guy at church for drinking Dr. Pepper at a ward Father and Son campout. Turns out, that guy was having an affair with a co-worker....and it wasn't his first. Reminds me of the author of ""Letter For My Wife."" This guy poured his entire heart and soul into this letter so that the love of his life would understand his loss of faith, and she never read it. Because, as it turns out, she was having an affair.

My ex-Mormon BIL told me the story of a Mormon FWB he had and that on one particular day they had wild sex. Then later, she freaked the fuck out on him when he suggested they watch a rated R movie. 🤦

I'm left to wonder if the feelings of being broken and miserable is its own drug. Is Mormonism just one big Stockholm Syndrome? Do Mormons not wanting  to hear the truth about their religion have less to do with attacking their faith and more to do with the trepidation of not knowing how to feel about not having daily/hourly/minutely feelings of guilt and self-loathing? ""I don't need to have a less-rigid life to improve my mental health. It's why I have abstinence from tea, coffee and rated R movies. That makes me feel so good about myself.""

This is not a flex post as this gets you nowhere these days, but as someone who makes \~$300k a year, I financially had nothing to show for it. My wife and I lived in a mindset of just do whatever and once we started a family we quickly realized that mindset was toxic. Thanks to YNAB I have been able to really see ""where every dollar goes"" and it was quite alarming. It has become an integral part of my life and I genuinely look forward to opening up YNAB every morning with my cup of coffee before the kids get up. Thank you YNAB and the phenomenal and motivating support in this community. Ya'll are the best. ",41,1749212283.0,ynab,6,0.94,False
1l4qy2d,https://i.redd.it/0tpxj9c3ua5f1.png,"[County Fence Bi-Annual Magazine] - Part 10 - Reason #1 Why Greater Napanee is Greater: Tim Hortons - by Brenda Hogg, Napanee Correspondent","Greater Napanee is greater for many reasons and #11 is our downtown Tim Hortons! That’s right! You may not realize it but back in 1993 Tim Horton’s coffee was an urban drink and Napanee showed that rural communities could have it too! Belleville got store #13 and Kingston got store #15 but those are big urban centres. It was only when we went to the city that we got our double-double just like on “Royal Canadian Air Farce.” But Napanee showed small communities everywhere that they deserved fancy coffee too.

 Napanee got store #741 which means Tim Hortons built 103 stores before getting to number #844 in Picton. Communities like Bath and Yarker are still waiting on their Tim’s and Wellington, despite being full of fancy city people, only gets a Tim’s attached to a gas station. You’re welcome, Picton! High five!

My first time going to the Napanee Tim Hortons was in 1994 with my boyfriend Dwayne. We were going to go fishing in his boat and wanted to get breakfast. We thought: why not try Tim’s? We got large double-doubles and I got a Boston cream donut and he got an apple fritter. It was delicious and not just because it was Tim’s but because it was our Tim’s. Dwayne had never been through a drive-thru before and he almost got the boat stuck on the speaker. It was a good thing it was light because we could just get out and lift it.

I remember sitting in the front of the boat skimming across the water as the sun came out, drinking that coffee, and feeling so luxurious. I have aged like fine wine but let me tell you that I was beautiful that day. I remember watching Dwayne as he piloted the boat out of the river, his long hair blowing in the wind and his moustache looking very handsome. In those days men wore jean jackets with the arms cut off and it made him look so strong and masculine. He was almost as handsome as Bryan Adams. I just wanted him to cuddle me but I knew he was looking at me too and it was the Tim’s that kept me from wrapping myself in a blanket. I know Dwayne was very happy for that!

It was one of the most romantic dates I have ever been on. We caught three pickerel and Dwayne even caught a giant catfish. It was so scary and I know it was one of God’s creatures but Dwayne protected me anyway with one of his empty beer bottles. Even today his chivalry makes me quiver. Let me tell you that fish is not all Duane caught that day! But I can’t tell you any more or things would get pretty steamy!

I love Tim Hortons. It is so nice that premium coffee chains want to support small towns too. A few years ago another fancy city coffee chain came to town, I think it was called fragrance or something. They’re closed now. I was sad that they closed but that’s what they get for competing with Tim’s. It’s too good and let’s not forget that it’s Canada’s coffee shop! I am so glad that we could lead the way for small places like Madoc and even international locations like Watertown to have great coffee too.

I love being confused and its just such a wonderful feeling when you don’t know something properly. Confusion stretches and massages the brain and squeezes all of the depression and anxiety from out of the brain. When I get confused it is an amazing moment and I get a rush of euphoria and joy that no other person could compete with. 

Oh I love confusing people even more and I hate those who lead a life that makes sense or try to make sense out of confusing things. These people are the destroyers of joy and they should be crushed and destroyed with not one atom left of them. I remember a couple of months back I saw my ceiling moving up and down inside the house and I was astounded once more at how this was happening and why I wasn’t crushed. It was incredible and how my ceiling was moving up and down and not changing the whole house was brain teasing. I could feel a good stretch in my brain and a good needed stretch was needed. I then saw a train coming out of my cupboard and the people inside the train were puking on each other. They were puking different colours on each other.
I had no idea what to make of all of this and I was so happy with what I was experiencing and how I couldn’t explain it. I loved this so much and I loved confusion more than my children who starved to death because I over fed them. I don’t know how they could have starved with the amount of food I had given them but then again, I was becoming high at the senselessness of it all. I love confusion more than my wife who I married on the moon without any space suit and I remember the wedding and how impossible it was, all of it. Although there we both were getting married on the actual moon and even my time table for work is confusing where it says my day off is at the same time as my working day, and that’s why I love my job.

My life is perfect because nothing makes sense and I don’t want anything to make sense in my life and I want things to happen without cause or effect. I once shot my gun at my friends head and all of a sudden he didn’t smell of body odour anymore. My friend had always struggled with the way he smelled and people in public would always move seats in public transports, but ever since I shot him in the head he smells amazing now. I love this and my brain is having a party and a wild ride and I don’t want it to stop like ever. I remember getting a taxi and the taxi never moved from its place and when I got out of the taxi, I was now at my destination. I then started to argue with the taxi that because he never actually moved his car I didn’t really owe him money. The taxi driver then started arguing with me at how logical I was being and he was right. I paid him extra and I started to burn my tongue with lava as punishment for making sense and instead of pain, I instead became a great singer for a while.

Then there is Arnold who is always doing things that make sense and I hate Arnold. The worst thing about Arnold is that he brings his logical straight forward world into other peoples lives and it also straightens out their lives for a bit. Everything starts to make sense and logical and the terror of everything making sense is just too torturous for me. I have warned Arnold of ever coming close to me and infecting my life with his life. Arnold tries to speak to me about things that make sense and I try to ignore but as my ears and mind absorb what Arnold is trying to say, everything in my life starts to straighten out. Heating things makes things hotter and cooling things makes things colder. I then punch Arnold and instead of falling he gets transported to a library. Then everything in my life becomes confusing again and I have a sigh of relief about it. Everyday I count the blessings that is confusion and I count them and I praise the confusion that gives me so much joy and laughter. People like Arnold makes things hardened and rough with their logic and sense where everything must go in a certain way and I don’t like that at all. I prefer it when I try to turn left on a road that it becomes right and when I crash into a car, I end up in Barbados. This is the way the world should always be.

As I see Arnold desperately trying to speak with he people inside the library about logic and sense I count the blessing of confusion. I cut down trees by placing a pillow on the tree and I drown by not going into the water. I breath in air by not breathing in air and I run by not running and by realising these things it gives my brain such a great massage. Honestly the brain needs a great massage and I could feel of the juicy tensions dripping away from my brain and it feels oh so marvellous. I burned my daughter with ice cream even though I never had a daughter but every day I hug my daughter even though I never got married, even though I got married on the moon. It’s the guy Arnold again trying to interrupt my counting of blessing that is confusion and as he comes closer to me, his aura starts to effect the world that I love and know. Everything starts to make sense and time seems to flow more correctly and what’s up is up and what’s down is down. Its just so horrible when things make sense and I don’t know who would want to live in a world like this.

I push Arnold and I run away from him by not running away and to fight against Arnolds is by doing something confusing that doesn’t make sense. I count more blessings of all of the confusion that I experience in my day to day life. I shopped around and paid money with it even though I never have money and I am penniless, the world got destroyed today but I am still here and I got a birthday present for someone who will never be born. Yes I felt more better now and especially when that Arnold guy ruins my life for a moment. Who does that Arnold think he is going up to people and straightening out their lives and making their brains feel more stiffer and rigid. Today I also met my worst enemy and I also didn’t meet him and realising that caused an opening in my brain and flooded with so much good feelings and I was in heaven. I said hello to people who weren’t there and I flooded a country with no water. My remote wasn’t working because the batteries had ran out of charge and so I got it working by not replacing it with batteries that do work. I walked on ground that were made of air and I pulled teeth out of people who had no teeth.


I love counting my blessing of confusion and I gave bald people haircuts and freed dogs by getting them more leeches. I knocked on a house by never knocking and I solved a problem even though there was no problem to start off with and I couldn’t stop counting all of the confusing blessings in my life. I was hopping with joy and licking other peoples ice creams and holding hands with people with no hands. Then Arnold was close by and his gathering was growing bigger and I couldn’t believe that his following was increasing. I couldn’t believe that people were listening to Arnold about logic and things making sense and I knew that he will infect those people by making their lives move in a straight line. Arnold you are a destroyer of good things and an asshole to begin with and the things that I want do to you Arnold for ruining peoples lives with idea of logic and things making sense is an abomination. Its not just an abomination but an travesty and you should be hanged Arnold for giving such idea of sense and logic. Nothing should make sense and nothing should ever go with the flow and life should be confusing because a confusing life is just amazing.

I cook food without cooking and eat without eating and I cannot imagine what your life is like Arnold and I couldn’t even be in the same room as you. Saying that I don’t want to be in the same room as you, I made that possible Arnold by being in the same room as you and I knew this confused you when kept on asking me why I was in your house, and when I kept on answering back with “the reason I am in your house is because I don’t want to be in the same place as you or in the same room as you” and this confusion caused you so much mental agony and I was enjoying it. Then I gave you more mental agony by saying how much I hate by loving you and this caused you more confusion but then you started attacking back at me by trying to make sense of things. Arnold when you tried to attack me back by trying to make sense of things I could feel everything going the way it should do in order and in physical sense. I hated it and my brain started to hurt from the depression and sadness and I tried attacking you back with more confusion. 

I started to count my confusions.
I made a cake for myself but a stranger had eaten instead and I shower by not showering, I watch tv with my eyes close, I listen to music by being deaf and I run by not using my legs. I could tell now Arnold was hurt by these things and he begged me to stop but I kept on going and going. I go on the computer by picking up a rock and I saved someone by not saving them and I gave a correct answer to a question by giving the wrong answer. I was winning against my fight against Arnold and I knew the confusion that surrounded me was now affecting Arnold life and then Arnold started to fight back. He started saying out correct math equations and things that made sense in a sentence and this started to hurt me. How dare you Arnold try to fight me back and I had never experience someone ever fighting back by having someone fight me back. I ran out of Arnolds by standing still and I could feel my life making sense. Things moved that had the correct engine and motion and the air was properly breathed in and when I held someone down in water, they had surely drowned. 

Luckily though I was away from Arnold long enough for the confusion to come back into my life. The police arrested me for drowning someone by not arresting me and I got given a life sentence by simply living life as a free man. Arnold was now growing in number and these lived lives that had made sense and were properly aligned. It was disgusting and I couldn’t believe that people would do such a thing and how dare they turn away from confusion. So I didn’t punish them by punishing them and we still had growing numbers of people like me who were still relishing in the wonderful enlightenment of confusion. I love being confused and I loved confusion more than I love my enemy and myself, and I am the enemy. I love saying things that don’t make sense and when my brain tingles when it is confused, what other substance can do such a thing for the brain without any real consequences. I had to count more confused blessings and I drink coffee by drinking orang juice, and I divorced again even though I was never married to begin with and I always move forwards by going backwards.

I don’t understand why people want their lives to make sense and such a logical life will become boring and depressing. I remember when my life made sense and everything felt so empty and I wanted to disappear. The existential crisis you will get from a logical life is unanimous and the constant same motions will go backwards and forwards till you go crazy and faithless. What sort of life is a logical one where the heart hardens and you feel nothing and the brain loses its imagination and wonder. 

Arnold should be decapitated, Arnold should be burned, Arnold should be made an example out of for those who stary against confusion. Arnold thinks he is doing good but he doing the opposite and fights are breaking between people of confusion and people of logic. Those who are of confusion like me keep doing confusing things by not doing confusing things to be confusing and to hurt the people of logic. The people of logic do logical things by picking up litter and putting it into a bin or setting the alarm clock to set off at a certain time so that you could get to a certain place in time. What a horrendous way to live and I will never yield and I will never bend down to the people of logic.

I will always be confused and I will always be doing what ever like by not doing it and sometimes when the confusion gets to a certain amount, the good feeling endorphins start pushing out some of the brain from out of the nose. I got a piece of my brain that came out of my nose but it wasn’t my brain but someone else’s. So someone else’s brain came out of my nose and I then decided to go to America by simply not going on a plane or a boat. Then I remember being surrounded by some of Arnolds and their auras and the things they were saying, it was making sense and my brain was hurting like a lot. I tried to count my confusions and I loved how I went home by not going home, I loved how I cooked hot food inside the fridge and I enjoyed fishing with my best friends that are also fishes. 

My best friends that are fishes would become offended when I catch a fish and don’t let it go and I love it how I got to sleep by not sleeping and waking up by not waking up and I enjoy how I pick my nose but always think its my finger but its actually someone else’s finger, and so I chop it off and give it to them and apologise to them for having their finger on my hand. Arnolds friends were surrounding me and the things they were shouting at me sounded like “something fell to earth and cocked up everything. Everything has gone haywire and you have to got to try and stay logical to beat the confusion. There is something in the air” and it was making sense and so I started killing them by not killing them and burying them in the skies. They were destroying everything that I love and I couldn’t believe that they would do such a thing and destroy a person’s wellbeing. I love being confused and its like when a person grinds their sharp nails against your eyes that’s how great confusion feels. Oh the freedom that confusion gives compared to logic because logic imprisons things to be a certain way. Like that thing should be like that and this thing should go like this, but now confusion has made it where anything is possible.

Arnold was crying at some of his followers that weren’t alive anymore and he looked at me with anger and I looked at him with anger by showing him kindness. I took him to restaurants and shopping and that’s how much I hated him. The confusion sometimes nearly took over him and now and then I though that I had Arnold in my grips and that he will be part of the confusion soon and just learn to love it. Its so good and I love counting my confusions like turning on the lights without turning anything on and nor having any electricity. I like how I show my kindness by angrily shouting verbal abuse at people and I love visiting doctors because I have nothing wrong with me and I demand they cure because I have nothing. Arnold gone now and he is kneeling down and its like he can’t take it anymore.

That’s it Arnold be my brother and be among the confused, be among the naked by wearing clothes, be among the senseless and illogical, be among the confusion. I go up to Arnold by not going up to him and he looks at me with the look that he is enjoying the confusion now and even some of his followers try to help him but it useless now, the confusion has set in and he will enjoy it, he will relish it and his mind will bend by not bending and all of the negative juices of the brain will leak out and he will be better. Are you confused yet by what I have told you. Don’t worry it will come to you and you will be in love.  ",2,1749212270.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

1l4qw2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/thrillerbooks/comments/1l4qw2v/crossfire_in_the_canyons_an_elvis_cole_x_alex/,Crossfire in the Canyons: An Elvis Cole x Alex Delaware mashup,"2 of my favourite series of thrillers are Robert Crais' Elvis Cole books, and Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware books. A couple days ago, I had this idea, so I asked ChatGPT to outline a short story of about 10.000 words, combining the 2 universes. Why 10.000? I had previously asked for an average word count of Stephen King's short stories, which I enjoy a lot. In spite of outliers on both ends, the average was between 9.000 and 10.000 words.

Since both Elvis Cole and Alex Delaware live and work in contemporary Los Angeles, I asked ChatGPT to come up with a story where Elvis Cole (and his friend/colleague Joe Pike) meet Alex Delaware (and his cop-partner, Milo Sturgis) while investigating a crime, which they then solve together by making use of their respective strengths and methods.

Anyway. I thought this was an interesting experiment, and you can read the result underneath! I'm curious to hear your opinion about the story, especially if you're familiar with The Elvis Cole and Alex Delaware thrillers.

Last but not least, considering both the linguistic and narrative quality of the result, neither Robert Crais nor Jonathan Kellerman need to be worried about being replaced by AI anytime soon ;-D

>***Crossfire in the Canyons***

>I.  
The girl lay in the dirt, eyes closed, a bottle of sleeping pills nearby. Morning fog curled through the Hollywood Hills like the breath of something ancient. Detective Milo Sturgis stood above the scene, arms folded, jaw set. ""Seventeen years old. Father runs a billion-dollar defense-tech company. Suicide note on her phone. But something smells off.""

>""You called me because you smell it?"" Alex Delaware asked, crouching beside the girl. The psychologist's tone was even, but his eyes were wary.

>""I called you because this isn't just another teenage suicide.""

>Milo paced the perimeter, eyes scanning for more than the obvious. ""She was found by a jogger. No witnesses. No camera footage worth a damn.""

>Alex looked over the girl again. ""Lack of hesitation wounds. She didn’t want to die.""

>Milo nodded. ""And the parents?""

>""Father’s a control freak. Mother’s emotionally tuned out, except now she wants answers.""

>Alex stood and looked at the hills. ""Let’s find out who wanted her dead.""

>

>II.  
Three miles away in a sun-drenched office lined with vintage Spider-Man memorabilia, Elvis Cole read the same suicide note. The girl’s mother, distraught and disbelieving, sat across from him.

>""She was a good kid. Moody, sure. But this? This wasn't her.""

>Elvis nodded. ""I’ll need access to her room, her phone, and every friend she had.""

>Joe Pike didn’t say a word. He stood in the corner like a statue carved from quiet violence.

>The mother handed over a zip drive. ""Everything I pulled from her laptop. She was on it constantly.""

>Elvis flipped the drive in his hand. ""We’ll find out what she wasn’t saying.""

>Cole and Pike visited the girl’s room. Elvis took in the minimalism—not typical of a teen. No posters, few books. Her laptop, dust-free, was the only sign of daily use.

>Pike flipped through a sketchbook on the shelf. Mostly landscapes. Some darker ones: an empty canyon, a faceless man, a door without a handle.

>""Visual metaphors for entrapment,"" Elvis said. Pike raised a brow. ""I took one psych class.""

>Meanwhile, Alex Delaware performed a psychological autopsy. He noticed signs in the girl’s social media of isolation, erratic emotional shifts, and references to someone called ""Coach.""

>He interviewed two of her teachers and a guidance counselor.

>""She was bright,"" one said. ""But her moods tanked fast this semester.""

>""Any bullying?"" Alex asked.

>""Not that we saw. But she did withdraw from her friends.""

>Alex studied her journal, obtained from her locker. Entries shifted from poetic and vibrant to detached and minimal. One line stuck out: \*'Coach says I have to shed my skin to be free.'\*

>

>III.  
Elvis knocked on the office door of Dr. Felicia Hayes, the girl's former therapist. It opened to reveal Milo Sturgis, badge on hip and suspicion in his eyes.

>""You again,"" Milo grunted. ""You working this?""

>""Hired by the mother,"" Elvis said, raising his hands. ""Not stepping on your toes. Just sniffing the ground.""

>Alex appeared behind Milo. ""Maybe we don’t need to step on toes. Maybe we walk together.""

>Inside, Dr. Hayes fidgeted with her coffee mug. ""She stopped coming two months ago. Said she was handling things with her life coach.""

>""Name?"" Milo asked.

>Hayes hesitated. ""Confidentiality is—""

>""Not when the client is dead and it may be homicide,"" Elvis said quietly.

>Hayes relented. ""Ryan Karn. She mentioned him often. Very charismatic. Unorthodox.""

>Elvis and Milo exchanged a glance.

>""We'll look into him,"" Milo said.

>

>IV.  
Cole and Pike tracked down two of the girl’s closest friends. One was in rehab. The other had disappeared. The common thread? A secret group online, led by someone known only as ""Coach.""

>Elvis visited a social media influencer conference under the guise of writing a piece for a magazine. The crowd was a blur of ring lights, curated personalities, and empty charisma. He spotted Karn from afar, holding court.

>""He looks like the type who charges for breathing exercises,"" Elvis muttered.

>Pike watched silently, clocking security, exits, and the way Karn's staff flinched at his movements.

>They obtained a flyer for Karn's upcoming weekend retreat. ""Self-Transformation: Unlock Your Inner Genius."" Held at a compound in Benedict Canyon.

>Milo tapped into LAPD’s cybercrimes unit. ""Coach"" had cropped up in connection with two other deaths, both staged as suicides, both from privileged families.

>""He's not just some troll,"" Alex said. ""This is someone who understands behavioral manipulation. Deeply.""

>Joe Pike tailed Karn back to a gated compound in Benedict Canyon. He noted the guards, the cameras, and the nondescript SUVs coming and going at all hours.

>""Cultish vibes,"" Elvis said when Pike reported back.

>""He's weaponized influence,"" Alex added. ""This isn't coaching. It's control.""

>

>V.  
Pike's silent tail of Karn ended with a drive-by shooting in an Echo Park parking lot. Pike avoided it. Barely.

>""Somebody just fired a warning shot,"" Elvis said.

>""Or tried to close a case permanently,"" Milo added.

>Elvis had the bullet analyzed. Standard 9mm, no serial. Clean.

>Pressure mounted. The girl’s father issued statements. Lawyers started circling. Alex, digging through university archives, found that ""Coach"" had once published under a different name: Dr. Evan Raine, a disgraced behavioral scientist.

>Raine had once run experiments on teenage conformity and susceptibility. He vanished after ethics violations shuttered his lab.

>""So he pivoted to monetizing control,"" Alex said. ""Influencers. Teens. Vulnerable minds.""

>Milo went to Internal Affairs for help navigating the case around political pressure. ""We go around them, not through them.""

>Elvis hacked into one of Raine's cloud drives, courtesy of a contact. The drive contained detailed psychological profiles, data collection logs, and coded names. The victim was among them.

>

>VI.  
They set up a sting. LAPD used a young female informant, posed as a recruit to Coach’s influencer group. She arranged a meetup at a secluded wellness retreat in Topanga Canyon.

>The informant, Tasha, had been a runaway. Now, she was cleaned up and brave enough to bait a predator.

>They trained her with Alex’s help, using roleplay and scripts. She memorized responses, practiced feigned vulnerability, rehearsed questions to provoke Raine.

>Pike and Milo waited in a borrowed surveillance van. Elvis monitored from a bluff with binoculars, earpiece in place. Alex was stationed nearby with a trauma response kit, just in case.

>Coach arrived. He looked ordinary. Too ordinary. That made him more dangerous.

>He began his pitch to Tasha with practiced ease. ""You don’t need your parents, your school, or your old life. You just need focus. You need to break free.""

>""Like she did?"" Tasha asked, subtly naming the victim.

>Coach paused. Then smiled. ""She was special. But she couldn’t let go.""

>That was enough.

>Milo moved first. Pike flanked. Elvis revved the Jeep and blocked the driveway.

>Coach panicked. Drew a weapon.

>Pike didn’t.

>One clean shot to the shoulder. He collapsed, howling.

>Alex reached Tasha within seconds. She was shaking.

>""You did great,"" Alex said. ""He’s done.""

>

>VII.  
Back at the precinct, Raine cracked under questioning. The deaths were part of a broader plan to test influence—how far he could push until someone broke.

>""They were experiments to him,"" Milo said, disgusted.

>""He never stopped being a researcher,"" Alex added. ""Just stopped pretending he had ethics.""

>Raine’s files detailed stages of control: identification, isolation, indoctrination, destruction. He had run the same model across multiple victims.

>Meanwhile, the media devoured the story. Headlines blared: \*Suicide Cult Leader Exposed\*. Parents demanded accountability. The defense-tech CEO denied knowledge, but an internal audit revealed his company funded one of Raine's ""wellness retreats.""

>Cole stood on the bluff where the girl had been found.

>""She never had a chance,"" he said to Pike.

>""Now others might.""

>

>VIII.  
Coach, aka Evan Raine, was charged with multiple counts of conspiracy, coercion, and accessory to murder.

>The girl’s death was ruled a homicide.

>Her father’s company took a media beating when connections to Raine surfaced. His empire, and reputation, crumbled.

>The remaining members of the secret group Raine ran were deprogrammed with the help of licensed professionals. Survivors testified. The D.A. built a watertight case.

>A week later, Cole and Delaware sat on the patio of a Santa Monica café.

>""You think he believed his own garbage?"" Elvis asked.

>Alex sipped his espresso. ""He believed he could control anything. Even death.""

>""Good thing we didn’t believe him.""

>Joe Pike watched the horizon.

>Milo muttered, ""I still don’t like private eyes.""

>Alex smiled. ""But you like results.""

>They all raised their glasses.

>Justice, in Los Angeles, came in strange partnerships.
