It seems like the time in between getting these put together and posted keeps getting longer, and longer. Is anyone still even reading this anymore?? Work has really been a constant interruption to finishing up the details of our Scotland trip, which at this point, feels like it happened last year. Sigh. Oh well, enough of the non-whisky related ranting, back to the trip! 
 
So, in the last episode of: Scotland Trip 2025, Day 5 we were left with more of an introspective ending to the day, reflecting on the Q.P.R. of Bowmore whisky. While we delved into the ins and outs of that on Day 5, we awoke on Day 6 feeling a sense of excitement. For today, was Lagavulin. And not just Lagavulin, but Ardbeg as well. But more about Ardbeg later. As is customary, we woke up, dressed, toast with some of the delicious and liquor filled jam that Donald painstakingly makes and sells at the Springbank gift shop. Nothing like starting your day of drinking, then with having Springbank 10 year Orange Marmalade smeared on two pieces of toast. Yum!
 
We completed on dressing and breakfast, and hurried outside to find Cathy waiting on us, as usual. We jumped in and headed off to Lagavulin. Now, from our Airbnb in Bowmore to Lagavulin Distillery in about 20 mins. We had Cathy pick us up a few minutes after 9:00 because we wanted to have some time to explore around the distillery. Tip: if you do go to any of these places, i.e. Scottish Whisky Distilleries, make time to go look around the grounds. These are not ‚Äúfactories‚Äù like we have here in the U.S. I mean, they are in a sense but they are placed in the most breathtaking locations imaginable. If you do have a chance to venture around and see the place itself, you‚Äôre going to be missing out on a lot of what makes these places so special. So, we are in the car headed to Lagavulin and we are pumped. 
 
So, Lagavulin. Let‚Äôs start at the beginning. Rewind back to May, 2018. We decide to plan a trip to Ireland. Never been before, want to go, let‚Äôs do it. As we are in the throes of trip planning, we look at each other and go, ‚Äúwhat about Scotland‚Äù? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, do you want to go to Scotland?‚Äù Realizing, at that time neither one of us had really had ‚Äúsingle malt scotch‚Äù before. I mean, I had Johnnie Walker and a buddy might have let me try a Glenfiddich but I would not have been able to name five distilleries with a gun to my head, literally. So, after more looking and planning we figured, ‚Äúwhy the hell not. Let‚Äôs go to Scotland too.‚Äù So, the plan was to spend about eight days in Ireland, rent a car drive around the whole country basically and then fly over to Scotland, landing in Edinburgh. Awesome. Done. Booked.

As we are finalizing our last day in Edinburgh on the schedule, we notice that we have about three hours of dead time, nothing booked, nowhere to go. Ugh. Now, I am not a go sit at the beach kind of person on vacation. I want to go see shit, I want to go do shit. I want to go experience shit. So for me, having three hours with no other prospect, other than wandering around or sitting in a hotel room, pass. So, as I am looking through the ‚Äútop things to do in Edinburgh‚Äù websites, I come across something called, ‚ÄúThe Scotch Whisky Experience‚Äù. *I do want to say that this is not a paid advertisement for this company. I found this on my own, with the help of Google.
So, I go to their site, look at the pics, read some reviews, looks good. I know nothing about whisky but this might be cool to go see. Done. Booked. So, fast forward through Ireland and all the time in Scotland, it was just castles and hikes and outdoor excursions, not a single distillery visited on that trip. Shameful.
 
So, we are at our final day in Edinburgh. We have had an amazing time, we all agreed that we really enjoyed Ireland but we fell in love with Scotland. So, walking to the TSWE, we find it walk in and are warmly greeted. We have our tickets scanned and off we go. Now, we ended up purchasing the Gold Package, which was the tour and a tasting of four drams at the bar. I think they have changed their packages over the last few years so, they may be different now. But we rode in a whisky barrel, Disney World style, through a little story about whisky production and the distillation process, learning about aging whisky, etc. It was fun and really interactive.

After the ride ended, we went into a large room and were sat at a table and given a ‚Äúsensory card‚Äù. This card contained the ‚Äúscents‚Äù of each of the whisky from that region. Islay, smelled like the sea and smoke, Lowland smelled floral and light, etc. That to me was really eye opening. All of this juice, smells completely different depending on which part of the country it‚Äôs made in? What?!? I think that was a big AHA moment for me in my whisky journey and made me want to learn more about it. After the scratch n‚Äô sniff cards, we were ushered into a giant room, filled with case after case, row after row, of bottles. Nothing but bottles. You look left, bottles. You look right, bottles. You look down, floor. They were everywhere. The guide began to tell us about the collection and the passion (also see: obsession) of the person that curated this collection and put it together for people to come through and view, ala museum style. It was so impressive, so massive and as I now know, so expensive to put all that together. It. Was. Amazing.
 
After the drooling ended, we were told to head to the bar for our whisky tasting. Now this was the part of the tour that I was kind of unsure about. At home, I kind of sort of drank bourbon. I mean, I had bourbon at home and I would drink it once every few weeks but I really loved wine. Wine was my jam. Get It? I loved a really good, dark, rich, heavy Cab Sauv. Yes! So, as we enter the bar and make our way to our stools, the bartender brings us a nicely presented flight of four whiskies on a wooden dram tray and begins to tell us the region from which each whisky was from and suggested, starting left and moving right.

Now, they did not tell you the distillery, that was a secret I guess but we were starting in with a Lowland and ending up on Islay. I‚Äôm not going to pretend that I remember what each one tasted like, I don‚Äôt. However, I do distinctly remember finally making it to the four dram, picking it up, smelling it, sitting it down and going, ‚ÄúNope. No way in hell‚Äù. I also eloquently added that the dram smelled like someone had, ‚Äústarted a fire, grabbed a bucket of water and poured it on the fire to put it out and then, in some deranged fit, decided to gather all of that water up, put it back in the bucket, that was just used to extinguish the fire, and pour it into a glass to drink. For enjoyment!

WTAF. Nope, now way. Uh-Uh. I‚Äôm not drinking that. Luckily, a very nice gentlemen that was sitting next to me, leaned in and said, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll gladly take it‚Äù. Here you go good sir. Needless to say, my first experience with a peated whisky was not some storybook, heavens opening moment. That would come a few short months later when a close friend invited me over for some drinks and pour me a glass, ‚ÄúWhat is it, I asked‚Äù? Just try it and let me know if you like it or not‚Äù. I drank it, wait, what is this? It‚Äôs delicious and complex and smoky and peppery and chocolate but also zesty like citrus, what?‚Äù He had poured me a dram of Ardbeg Dark Cove. And thus began the journey.
 
FF ‚Äì we are in the car pulling up to Lagavulin Distillery. We are there plenty early to wonder around and enjoy the scenery of the distillery grounds. We exit the vehicle and are immediately greeted by the sound of sheep, which apparently live in the filed immediately next to the distillery. Whisky sheep. Cool. We grab some pics of the distillery and walk down to the pavilion down at the bay. It‚Äôs gorgeous. Beautiful sunny day, not one cloud. Perfect whisky weather. Off in the distance we could even see Dunyvaig Castle. How cool is that? We walked around a bit more, took more pics and decided to head inside and peep the gift shop. Now, the distillery is a touch over 200 years old. And once you step inside, you notice it immediately. The gift shop, while very well appointed, is small. Much smaller than most of all the other distilleries, including its own Diageo counterparts.

As we enter, we are greeted and make our way to the counter. We check in and are instructed to go back to lounge area before our tout begins, the guide will meet us back there. We began looking around the shop, they have all the usual wares. Hats, pens, shirts, notebooks, etc. They also have whisky. And this is not the standard OB whisky line either. They have the Distillery Exclusive bottles, and the Feis Ile bottles and the Jazz Festival bottles which IMO are so of the best ones. And they don‚Äôt just have the most recent year‚Äôs, they have some from a few years back as well. Pretty cool.
 
We complete our gift shopping and inquire about the bar and its location. They tell us to go down, take a right, go out the door and it‚Äôs on the left outside, can‚Äôt miss it. Got it. With directions to the bar (building is over 200 years old remember) we headed out in hope of finding it. We exited back outside and followed the signs, which we were grateful for. We saw the sign above the door ‚ÄúMalt Mill Bar‚Äù and headed inside. It was very cozy, more modern than the gift shop aesthetically speaking. We made our way through the lounge and over to the Malt Mill Bar, aptly named after the failed opening on the 2nd distillery on the Lagavulin grounds, Malt Mill Distillery. We were greeted, handed a menu and started to peruse over the choices. We picked out a couple of special Lagavulin releases and told the young lady our requests. She asked, ‚Äòare you doing a tour‚Äù? Yes, we are. We are doing the Lagavulin Distillery Exclusive Experience. ‚ÄúWell, not to spoil anything but you don‚Äôt want to pay for these drams here, because you‚Äôll get to try all of these on the tour during the tasting.‚Äù Really? Awesome. Thank you very much for letting us know. Ok then. We ended up trying a couple from the Diageo lineup and the standouts were the Roseisle 14 year (damn that one is good) and the Cameronbridge 26 year (damn that one is good too). After our drams, we settled up and heading back down to the main distillery building because our tour was about to start.

As stated previously, I‚Äôm not going to bore you with all the details of the distillery tour, which by the way, I feel like I am almost qualified to give at this point, having gone through so many of them over the last few days. The tour was really good however, we had a gentleman (accompanied by a young lady) who was a seasonal tour guide and had just came back for the festival season doing our tour. He was under the watchful eye of a young lady that had been there for a few years now. Both were very engaging and were happy to answer any questions the group had and kept the tour moving along at a good pace. Once we had went through the introduction of the distillery (i.e. history of the site and building) we moved to the kiln area, then on to the mash tun, washbacks and finally over the stills.  

Lagavulin has two wash stills and two spirit stills and also boasts the slowest double maturation time of all the Islay whiskies. The wash stills are filled to almost max capacity which provides less contact between the vapor and the copper which, according to them, provides more phenols on the final product. Of course there was mention of the Port Ellen Maltings situation and they made no bones that Diageo was looking four for Diageo first and foremost. PEM is still providing when and where they can, but not in the previous quantities, especially with the re-opening of Port Ellen Distillery. The distillery has been producing about 1.5 million liters per year but as with some of the other distilleries we visited, they did mention that they were cutting back to five days a week instead of seven.

Once we finished up with the stills and spirit safe, which they would not left you get within twenty feet of, we headed out to Mackie‚Äôs Lounge for the tasting. Yay! The group headed over and made our way inside. We entered into the downstairs area and the room had already been prepared for our arrival. The room is nice and cozy with some modern touches. Leather couches situated on the perimeter of the room. Coffee tables for each sitting area and each place made up for each guest with six unmarked glasses and a take home Lagavulin branded glass sitting center. The group found our seats as did the guides and we prepared to get tucked in.  

They began by explaining the maturation process for Lagavulin and how cask influences the final product. And that we will be trying several different whiskies matured in different casks to show both impact and influence.  ‚ÄúBut first‚Äù, he said, ‚Äúwe have to start at the very beginning‚Äù ‚ÄúSo the first thing we‚Äôre going to be trying is our new make spirit‚Äù.

The new make, which was sitting at 69.9% ABV surprisingly had little to no ethanol burn on the nose. There is smoke on the nose, but there‚Äôs also chocolate (?) and a distinct vegetal note. Really interesting stuff. The taste was really good. The palate showed more of the proof than the nose but still had the Lagavulin character you have in the finished product with more grain presence.

After the new make, we were presented with our next filled glass, which was the Lagavulin 26 yr old. This is one that I had seen but never had the opportunity to try. At a meager $2,500 USD per bottle (ha!) this whisky was matured in FF PX and Oloroso casks before being bottles at 44.2% natural cask strength. The nose was divine. So rich and nuanced. The palate showed more of that richness. Stewed fruit, light spice. Time has softened the smoke and it sat more on the finish. Still present, but very much tamed. It was really good, but not worth the asking price IMO.

Next up was the 2023 Jazz Featival 15 yr Oloroso Sherry Release. I‚Äôve said it before, I feel like Lagavulin really shows out with their Jazz and Feis releases and this one is no different. Rich dark fruit wrapped in smoky BBQ goodness, al the way from nose to palate to finish. Lick smacking good. Finish lingers on for a while, making you want more. Yum! Only three in and this is already phenomenal. What‚Äôs next?

Number four in the lineup was another Jazz Festival release from last year. The 2024 Jazz Festival 14 yr Cab Sauv Wine Cask Release. So, quick funny story. Two night before I‚Äôm sitting here in Mackie‚Äôs Lounge reaching for this dram. I‚Äôm sitting at a table in the Bowmore Hotel looking through the whisky menu. I see that they have this whisky available to try. I like Lagavulin and enjoy the Jazz Festival bottles, I place my order which included this dram and they were quickly poured and I brought them back to the table. Picked up the glass, smelled pretty good. Fruit and tannins that you would find on a typical wine finish, smoke was there but not overly present. Go to take a drink, what? Take another small sip. Uh. Am I having a stroke? Passed to my partner. Smells, takes a sip. What is that? What is that indeed? Now they have us the bottle to bring back to our table so, I uncork the bottle and smell it. Smells the same as the glass. This whisky is terrible. Like truly awful. Like so bad it doesn‚Äôt even deserve tasting notes. I said out loud, ‚Äúthis is the worst Lagavulin I have ever tried‚Äù. FF back to this glass sitting in front of me at the tasting. Dammit. I don‚Äôt wanna drink this nasty ass thing, again. No where to fake drink and pour it out. Definitely don‚Äôt want to be rude to the guides, looking at me smiling right now, while I‚Äôm also sitting like five feet from them. Welp, here we go. Smelled it, smelled the same. Great. Ugh. I will take the tiniest sip ever and just pour the rest up in the provided driver dram bottles. Great idea. Ok. Tiny sip. Huh. Another tiny sip. Huh. A less tiny sip. What?? This whisky is delicious. How is that happening? I. Was. Shocked. But, the one at the bar was terrible how did this happen? I‚Äôm still puzzled. Maybe blame it on set and setting or maybe blame it on the bottle at the bar being 3/4 empty but whatever it was, this was like drinking two completely differently whiskies. This one was sweet with sour fruit wine notes campfire, and caramel. A little drying, which I like in wine finished whisky and a super long finish. Delicious stuff!

After I stopped questioning everything I had even know about anything, we got to the fifth dram. This was our first and only Feis Ile release of the tasting. Last year‚Äôs 2024 Feis Ile 10 yr Super Heavily Peated. This one was made using a higher peated distillate and heavily charred casks. For me personally, the whisky was ok. Nothing spectacular, nose and palate were briny, white pepper, vanilla and peat smoke. The palate offered much of the same with some added lemon zest which I did enjoy. In this lineup, this one seemed more simple, pedestrian and given the $225 USD price tag this bottle had, if you can even find it for that anymore, didn‚Äôt come close to being worth the cost.

As we came to the final glass, and the conclusion of the tasting the guide asked up to nose the glass before any info was given in the whisky. As we began to smell the whisky, the group began quietly discussing their findings. To me, the whisky smelled a little older. My refined and had a depth to it. Nothing like the 7 yr old Feis Ile bottling we have that is wild, young and untamed. The palate was perfect. Sweet and savory, sweet BBQ meats with some barrel spices, must be bourbon cask. Lemon and lime and a wonderful vein of smoke that ran dead center through the whole dram through the finish as well. As the guide asked for everyone‚Äôs guesses on the age, some people said 12 yr some said 20 yr. I went with a more realistic 14 years. To my surprise, the guide stated that this was a 7 year old Lagavulin FF Ex-Bourbon Single Cask 55.4%. And this was the one that we would be filling up our 20cl bottle to take home. Wow! This was delicious. I‚Äôve never had a Lagavulin that young and that nuisance before ever. The guide said that no one had footed the age right on this one and that ever the distillery guides were all surprised it was only 7 years old.

As we finished up this delicious offering, the group began to make our way to the cask to hand fill our bottle. One by one we filled the bottle, placed the cork and hand wrote out your label which we then affixed to our bottles, before placing them in our Lagavulin branded green drawstring bag. Fancy! As we finished up with filling our bottles, we thanked the guides and said our goodbyes to the group. This one was one of the best. The tour, while not unlike some of the others, was still unique and interesting. But the tasting, the tasting is what set this one apart. The width and breadth of what was offered was really amazing. No OB 16 yr or Travel Retail 10 yr here, oh no. This is one of the top tastings we‚Äôve had, and we will definitely be back.

As we exited through the gift shop and back into the sunlight, Cathy was already waiting in the car park. We jumped in and almost in unison stated how awesome that was and how well have to come back. Unfortunately, we did not have a lot of time to reminisce because we had but a few minutes car ride to our final stop on our Islay trip, Ardbeg.

1lmw4wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Salary/comments/1lmw4wt/northern_euorpe_salary_and_col/,Northern Euorpe Salary and COL,"I just visited Stockholm for the first time and I‚Äôm shocked at how expensive everything was.

I currently live in the Bay Area and the cost of going out to eat, either for a meal or coffee was comparable to the Bay Area. On top of that, groceries stores seemed inline with grocery prices in the Bay. Things like alcohol and clothes shopping were actually more expensive.

Considering people in Sweden on average have salaries that are 50% of the US average and must be ~30% of the Bay Area average, how do people survive. The difference is significant enough where $5000 per year of health insurance won‚Äôt make a difference.

Rent I‚Äôm sure is cheaper, but do people just not go out for dinner and drinks? I‚Äôm guessing everyone must be very frugal and their discretionary spending is very minimal.

Anyone else notice this?

TLDR: Stockholm seems to have the same COL as the Bay Area, outside of rent. With salaries being at least 50% less on average, how do people have any discretionary spending?",1,1751141411.0,Salary,0,1.0,False

1lmvz55,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lmvz55/so_i_might_have_messed_up_my_whole_relationship/,So I might have messed up my whole relationship with my sister by bringing up the past,"So for the past few days I've been thinking about how horrible of a brother I am too just dump a part of our past on my younger sister. we both were young I am the older one by a few years and we've always got along... A little too much when younger. Actives that were definitely sexual to a certain extent. When parents are working long hours. Playing doctor, that kind of thing.

I found out that I'm aroused through touch. Not the in the best way... Actually we rough house a lot but when ever she touches weird places or it excited me too much I would stop her half heartedly and I guess it was never enough because she takes it as a joke. I'd hide it to the best of my abilities find ways out. Excuse myself to the washroom what not. The worst decision is to wank it off so I come back out normal. But this probably has caused me to disturbingly aroused from her scent unintentionally...

This became unhealthy, now she's in highschool while I'm working a steady job. Everyday I would come home to an adorable puppy with sparkly eyes looking for company every time I knock at the door for someone to open it.

What got me thinking more about this was when we were laughing at random memes she started to fidget with my tummy (I used to be fat so I still have that chubby build) she stuck her finger into my belly button, I removed it, the. She fidget with my nipples. And that didn't sit well with me.

I decided to put ""talk to sister if need be"" on my to-do list in hopes I never have to talk about it but I am horriblily wrong about that.

I usually leave the house early and come home late. She would always look through the window through the door and flip me off while unlocking the door for me. I would then try to flick her in the forehead or retaliate by flipering her off too. We even got into a weird habit of pretending to not see eachother's hand while throwing the finger. It never happend if we don't mentally recognise it right?

Anyways, for the past two months I've been thinking how to approach her about this topic because it's definitely affecting me. Physical and mentally, I love her with all my heart and would offer my soul to the devil to take back what I've told her about our past and my situation. Now know too well this can never be taken back.

I used to be her pillar. Almost a father figure to her as our whole family is always in arguments with our dad. That's another topic on its own. We used to cuddle in bed spilling out heart out about how dad is annoying. Imagine how comfortable if dad wasn't so annoying and what not. Highs and lows, literally everything.

It's been a few days that I've told her about my situation. Here is a summary of how it all went down

I suck at talking so it definitely didn't go through properly. I was working away at my desk with all the paperwork that's coming up expired documents. Applications for my parents as I am the adult that is fluently bilingual. She's the usual sitting beside me going through the boring times until she saw my to-do list item...

At first she pointed at the item, I ignored her. She then said:""hey what's this about?""

Me:""oh don't worry about it it's not the right time""

Of course as curious as another person would be she pestered, ""oh? Is it about a new girl you talking to?""

""No, nothing like that it's a more more serious. I'll tell you another time.""

Sister: ""okay now I can't sleep properly.""

I, in my sleep deprived, tired, post-coffee state just said to myself why the fk not. And just unloaded:"" remember when we were kids took showers together? It's stuff related to this and how I am aroused when you touch me in weird places""

so she's definitely gotten the wrong idea. I've tried to reach out telling her if she wants to talk about it I'll be here and I'll give her space to think and respects her decision... I only got: ""can we just forget about it?""

For the past few days I've been drowning myself with work and over due paperwork. The most productive I've been in a while I guess. 

When I get home in full sweat knocking the door for minutes... silence follows... I would have to pull out my keys to unlock the door ugh... To then swing the door open into the cold deafening silence. The joyful, precious puppy isn't there any more.

I know I always tell her she's annoying and clingy. She follows me everywhere I go. When I'm around the house doing chores or just relaxing at my desk playing video games she's there. I guess now I've gotten my wish that I never truly desired.

The silence is killing me. Any conversation between us has been shallow and awkward. I know I should give her space and this relationship will never be the same. I just need someone to tell me I'm the worst and most selfish brother for even getting aroused from rough housing. It might make my guilt die down. What kind of brother does this?


Note - I am the unreliable narrator leaving out a lot of things for various reasons forgive me for that too.

I also know therapist would help me a ton but... She said it's fine and forget about it. I don't want to make this a big deal so here I am.",3,1751140978.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
1lmvz3x,https://i.redd.it/mlsyai8wmp9f1.jpeg,"Boundaries around Annesburg and the movable moon (this is long, you should get a cup of coffee or something)","I wanted to make a video detailing all this but, well, life got in the way.  And fair warning, with apologies, you will probably have more questions than answers after reading this and I will probably not be able to answer them, because I don‚Äôt know.

The Boundaries:

Every time you load a game you might have noticed that the Annesburg gunsmith icon shows up for a few seconds in the mini map (so long as you‚Äôve been there before).  When you go to Annesburg the gunsmith icon will appear earlier than normal - that‚Äôs the red circle in the photo.  This happens until you play any mission.  After playing a mission this red circle boundary is no longer a thing.

If you order a bath in Annesburg but leave without going to the bath house, the bath icon will stay on the mini map until you leave the area of the light blue rectangle.  Also, going into the Annesburg bath house dramatically changes the weather - cold and rainy to warm and sunny and vice versa.  Doesn‚Äôt matter if you take a whole bath or leave immediately.

Okay, so what, right?  Well‚Ä¶

Moving The Moon:

There are a couple ways to achieve this, but this is the quickest and easiest method I have found.

First - go to Van Horn, sleep or wait until 6pm, then ride to the green ""X"" in the photo.

Second - replay the mission ""Pouring Forth Oil IV"".  You don‚Äôt actually have to replay it, skip the cut scene, then jump off the wagon and run away until the mission fails, then cancel the replay.

Third - once you‚Äôre back to the regular game, ride to the position of the blue ""X"" in the photo.  Wait here until 8pm, keep an eye on the moon in the east.

Fourth - once it‚Äôs 8pm simply ride into the area of the light blue rectangle and watch the moon travel across the sky to the south west.  It lands in the SW at 9pm, then slowly moves up and south until 10pm where it seemingly stops.  I say seemingly but it technically continues to move ever so slightly up and south until 5am when it migrates back to the west before stopping at 6am, which is where it normally would be at 6am.  Now, these are the positions the moon takes during ""Pouring Forth Oil IV"".  

Is this all a glitch?  Is this all left over code from cut content?  I really don‚Äôt know.  But I personally believe it‚Äôs neither of those.

Here‚Äôs some further notes on this investigation:

1. Some random encounters will disrupt this movement of the moon.  There‚Äôs a random encounter just south of Annesburg (dude tied up to a tree) that will disrupt this.  If you haven‚Äôt encountered this it may disrupt the process I laid out above.  There‚Äôs also a night folk encounter on the road to Lakay, for example. If you‚Äôve already successfully moved the moon to the SW, this night folk encounter will send the moon flying back to wherever it would normally be in the night.

2. The whispering woods  - outlined in orange on the photo - will also disrupt the moon in the SW.  However, you can simply ride back into the area of the light blue rectangle and the moon will travel back to the SW.

3. The Native Burial - this place is complicated.  Just being in the vicinity can disrupt this moon thing and I haven‚Äôt worked this all out.  But if you‚Äôre able to get there with the moon in the SW, walking into the stone circle will slowly move the moon back.  Walk out of the circle and the moon will glitch back instantly to the SW.  This seems in line with weather/fog/clouds you can affect by doing this on any given day.

4.  Once you‚Äôve moved the moon to the SW, sleeping and using fast travel will cancel this effect until you go back into the area of the light blue rectangle.  But, so far it seems getting black out drunk as a means of passing time doesn‚Äôt affect it.

5.  You can‚Äòt save and reload this.  The whole thing is cancelled by saving and/or reloading a save.

6.  Annesburg is the only town with a rectangle border for the mini map bath icon.  Rhodes is circular but with a strange bulge in the SE.  The other towns are all circular.

7.  I‚Äôve been many places with this moon in the SW - the top of Mt Shann (with and without the UFO), the sun/moon dial, the Hani‚Äôs Bethel UFO, each of the 4 alien rock paintings, Monto‚Äôs Rest, on top of the pillars at Twin Stack Pass, the Scratching Post in New Austin, and more.  I even hung out with the meditating monk for a whole night once.

I‚Äôve come up empty on all of it.  So is it a glitch?  Am I crazy?  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a glitch.  But I am probably a little crazy.

My only standing theory is that you have to be in the right place at the right time.  And based on the stars, there are 20 unique nights.  The Panoramic Map may be pointing to the night needed.  On that map there is one star brighter than the others, and it is positioned above St. Denis.  There is one night in game where, from the vantage point of the Panoramic Map, the star Sirius - the brightest star - is indeed above St. Denis.  

So that‚Äôs it.  My brain is fried.  I‚Äôve come up empty on this for so long and truly do not have time for further investigation.  But I wanted to pass it along to any of you who may be interested.  Again, this very well may be nothing, just a glitch, cut content, etc.  I still think there‚Äôs something here, though.

¬† TWENTY-THREE STORIES UP AND ALL I COULD SEE OUT THE WINDOWS was grey smog. They could call it the City of Angels if they wanted to, but if there were angels out there, they had to be flying blind.  
  
¬† Los Angeles is a place where people, those with wings and without, come to hide. Hide from others, hide from themselves. I‚Äôd come to hide and I‚Äôd succeeded, but staring out at the thick, dirty air, I wanted to go home. Home where the air was blue most of the time and you didn‚Äôt have to water the ground to get grass to grow. Home was Cahokia, Illinois, but I couldn‚Äôt go back because they‚Äôd kill me if I did, my relatives and their allies. Everyone wants to grow up to be a faerie princess. Trust me. It‚Äôs overrated.  
  
¬† There was a knock on the office door. It opened before I could say anything. My boss, Jeremy Grey, stood framed in the doorway. He was a short, grey man, four feet eleven inches, an inch shorter than me. He was grey from his dark Armani suit to his button-up shirt and silk tie. Only his shoes were black and shiny. Even his skin was a pale uniform grey. Not from illness or age. No, he was a trow in the prime of life, just a little over four hundred. There were some lines around his eyes, along the thin mouth, that made him appear mature, but he‚Äôd never be old. Without the aid of mortal blood and a pretty serious spell, Jeremy might live forever. Theoretically. Scientists say that in about five billion years the sun will expand and engulf the Earth. The fey won‚Äôt survive that. They will die. Does five billion years count as forever? I don‚Äôt think so. Though it‚Äôs close enough to make the rest of us envious.  
  
¬† I leaned my back against the windows and the thick, hanging smog. The day was as grey as my boss, but his color was a cool, crisp grey, like clouds before a spring rain. What lay outside the window felt heavy and thick like something you would try to swallow, but you‚Äôd never get it down. It was a day to choke on, or maybe it was just my mood.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou look gloomy, Merry,‚Äù Jeremy said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù He closed the door behind him, making sure it shut. Privacy, he was giving us privacy. Maybe it was for my benefit, but somehow I didn‚Äôt think so. There was a tightness around his eyes, a set to his thin, well-tailored shoulders that said I wasn‚Äôt the only one in a bad mood today. Maybe it was the weather or the lack of it. A good rain shower or even a good wind would have cleared out the smog and let the city breathe again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHomesick,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, Jeremy?‚Äù  
  
¬† He gave a small smile. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt fool you, can I, Merry?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNice outfit,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† I knew I looked hot when Jeremy complimented my clothes. He always looked impeccable even in jeans and T-shirt, which he only wore if he absolutely had to be undercover. I‚Äôd seen Jeremy do a three-minute mile in Gucci loafers once, chasing a suspect. Of course, it helped that his dexterity and speed were more than human. When I thought I might have to actually chase someone, a rare occasion, I got out the jogging shoes and left the high heels at home.  
  
¬† Jeremy put into his eyes that look a man gives you when he‚Äôs appreciating the view. It wasn‚Äôt personal, but among the fey it‚Äôs an insult to ignore someone who‚Äôs obviously trying to be attractive, a slap in the face telling them that they‚Äôd failed. Apparently, I hadn‚Äôt failed. I‚Äôd woken up to the smog and dressed brighter than normal to try and cheer myself up. Royal blue suit jacket, double-breasted, silver buttons, a matching blue pleated skirt that was so short, it was only a fringe across my thighs underneath the jacket. The outfit was short enough that if I crossed my legs wrong, I‚Äôd flash the tops of my black thigh-highs. Two-inch patent leather high heels helped show off the legs. When you‚Äôre as short as I am, you‚Äôve got to do something to make your legs look long. Most days the heels were three inches.  
  
¬† My hair was a deep rich red in the reflections of the mirrors. A color more red than auburn, a color that had black highlights instead of the usual brown that most redheads had. It was as if someone had taken dark red rubies and spun them out into hair. It was a very popular color this year. Blood auburn it was called in the high court of the fey royalty. Faerie Red, Sidhe Scarlet, if you went to a good salon. It was actually my natural color. Until it became popular this year and they finally got the shade right, I‚Äôd had to hide my true color. I‚Äôd gone for black, because it looked more natural than human red with my skin tone. A lot of people getting the dye job made the mistake of thinking that Sidhe Scarlet complements a natural redhead‚Äôs coloring. It doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the only true red color I know of that matches a pale, pure white skin tone. It‚Äôs the red hair for someone who looks great in black, true reds, royal blues.  
  
¬† The only things I still had to hide were the vibrant green and gold of my eyes and the luminosity of my skin. I used dark brown contacts for the eyes. My skin‚Äîthat I had to tone down using glamour, magic. Just a steady concentration like music in the back of my head, to never let down my guard and start to glow. Humans don‚Äôt actually glow, no matter how luminous they may be. No glowing, which was why the contacts covered my eyes. I also wove a spell around myself like a long familiar coat, an illusion that I was just a human with lesser fey blood in my background who had some psychic and mystical abilities that made me a really excellent detective, but nothing too special.  
  
¬† Jeremy didn‚Äôt know what I was. No one at the agency knew. I was one of the weakest members of the royal court, but being sidhe means something even on the weak end of the scale. It meant that I had successfully hidden my true self, my true abilities, from a handful of the best magicians and psychics in the city. Maybe in the country. No small feat, but the kind of glamour I was best at wouldn‚Äôt keep a knife from finding my back or a spell from crushing my heart. For that I needed skills that I didn‚Äôt have, and that was one of the reasons I was in hiding. I couldn‚Äôt fight the sidhe, not and live. The best I could do was hide. I trusted Jeremy and the others. They were my friends. What I didn‚Äôt trust was what the sidhe might do to them if I were discovered, and my relatives found out my friends had  
known my secret. If they were truly ignorant, then the sidhe would leave them alone and only hurt me. Ignorance was bliss on this one. Though I thought that some of my very good friends would see it as a type of betrayal. But if the choices were them alive, with all their body parts intact, but angry at me, or dead by torture but not angry at me, I‚Äôd take angry. I could live with their anger. I wasn‚Äôt sure I could live with their deaths.  
  
¬† I know, I know. Why not go to the Bureau of Human and Fey Affairs and get asylum? My relatives would probably kill me when they found me, but if I went public and aired our dirty laundry for the world media, they would most definitely kill me. And they‚Äôd kill me slower. So no police, no ambassadors, just the ultimate game of hide-and-seek.  
  
¬† I smiled at Jeremy and gave him what I knew he wanted: the look that said that I appreciated the slender potential of his body under his perfect suit. To humans it would have looked like flirting, but for the fey, any fey, it wasn‚Äôt even close to flirting. ‚ÄúThanks, Jeremy, but you didn‚Äôt come in here to compliment my clothes.‚Äù  
  
¬† He walked farther into the room, running manicured fingers along my desk edge. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got two women in my office. They want to be clients,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWant to be?‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† He turned, leaning against the desk, arms crossed over his chest. Mirroring my stance at the windows, either unconsciously, or purposefully, though I didn‚Äôt know why. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt usually do divorce work,‚Äù Jeremy said.  
  
¬† I gave him wide eyes, pushing away from the windows. ‚ÄúDay one lecture, Jeremy: The Grey Detective Agency never, ever, does divorce work.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know, I know,‚Äù he said. He pushed away from the desk and came to stand beside me, staring out into the fog. He didn‚Äôt look any happier than I felt.  
  
¬† I leaned back against the glass so I could see his face better. ‚ÄúWhy are you breaking your cardinal rule, Jeremy?‚Äù  
  
¬† He shook his head without looking at me. ‚ÄúCome meet them, Merry. I trust your judgment. If you say we stay out of it, we‚Äôll stay out of it. But I think you‚Äôll feel the same way I do.‚Äù  
  
¬† I touched his shoulder. ‚ÄúAnd how are you feeling, boss, other than worried?‚Äù I ran my hand down his arm, and it made him look at me.  
  
¬† His eyes had gone dark charcoal grey with anger. ‚ÄúCome meet them, Merry. If you‚Äôre as angry afterward as I am, then we‚Äôll nail this bastard.‚Äù  
  
¬† I gripped his arm. ‚ÄúJeremy, relax. It‚Äôs just a divorce case.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat if I told you it was attempted murder?‚Äù His voice was calm. Matter of fact, it didn‚Äôt match the intensity in his eyes, the vibrating tension in his arm.  
  
¬† I moved back from him. ‚ÄúAttempted murder? What are you talking about?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe nastiest death spell that‚Äôs ever walked into my office.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe husband is trying to kill her?‚Äù I made it a question.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomeone is, and the wife says it‚Äôs the husband. The mistress agrees with the wife.‚Äù  
  
¬† I blinked at him. ‚ÄúAre you saying that the wife and the mistress are in your office?‚Äù  
  
¬† He nodded, and even through all the outrage, he smiled.  
  
¬† I smiled back. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs got to be a first.‚Äù  
  
¬† He took my hand. ‚ÄúIt might be a first even if we did do divorce work,‚Äù he said. His thumb rubbed back and forth over my knuckles. He was nervous, or he wouldn‚Äôt be touching me this much. A way to reassure himself, like a touchstone. He raised my hand to his lips and planted a quick kiss on my knuckles. I think he‚Äôd noticed what he was doing, that his nerves were showing. He flashed me a white smile, the best caps money could buy, and turned toward the door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnswer one question first, Jeremy.‚Äù  
  
¬† He adjusted his suit, minute movements to tug it back into place as if it needed it. ‚ÄúAsk away.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy are you scared of this?‚Äù  
  
¬† The smile faded until his face was solemn. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a bad feeling about this one, Merry. Prophecy isn‚Äôt one of my gifts, but this one has a bad smell to it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen pass it by. We aren‚Äôt the cops. We do this for a very nice paycheck, not because we‚Äôve sworn to serve and protect, Jeremy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf after you meet them, you can honestly walk away from it, then we will.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy is my vote suddenly a presidential veto? The name on the door is Grey, not Gentry.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecause Teresa‚Äôs so empathic she couldn‚Äôt turn anyone away. Roane is too much the bleeding heart to turn tearful women away.‚Äù He adjusted his dove grey tie, fingers smoothing over the diamond stickpin. ‚ÄúThe others are good for grunt work, but they aren‚Äôt decision makers. That leaves you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I met his eyes, trying to read past the anger, the worry, to what was really going on inside his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not an empath, and you‚Äôre not a bleeding heart, and you make dandy decisions, so why can‚Äôt you make this one?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecause if we turn them away, they won‚Äôt have anywhere else to go. If they leave this office without our help, they‚Äôre both dead.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stared at him, and finally understood. ‚ÄúYou know we should walk away from this one, but you can‚Äôt bring yourself to pass judgment on them. You can‚Äôt bring yourself to condemn them to death.‚Äù  
  
¬† He nodded. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat makes you think that I can do it, if you can‚Äôt?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping one of us is sane enough not to be this stupid.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt get you all killed for the sake of strangers, Jeremy, so be prepared to walk away from this one.‚Äù Even to me, my voice sounded hard, cold.  
  
¬† He smiled again. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my little cold-hearted bitch.‚Äù  
  
¬† I shook my head and walked toward the door. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the reasons you love me, Jeremy. You count on me not to flinch.‚Äù  
  
¬† I walked out into the hallway that led between offices, sure that I would turn these women away. Certain that I would be the wall that kept us all safe from Jeremy‚Äôs good intentions. Goddess knows, I‚Äôd been wrong before, but seldom as wrong as I was about to be.  
  
¬† Chapter 2  
  
¬† I THOUGHT FOR SOME REASON I‚ÄôD BE ABLE TO TELL WHICH OF THE TWO women was wife and which was mistress just by looking at them. But at first glance they were just two attractive women, casually dressed, like girlfriends out for a day of shopping and lunch. One woman was small, though a few inches taller than either Jeremy or myself. Blond hair cut just above the shoulders, with a careless curl to it that said it was natural and she hadn‚Äôt done anything special to it this morning. She was pretty in a girl-next-door sort of way, with extraordinary blue eyes that took up most of her face. Her eyebrows arched thick and black, balancing out a lace of dark lashes that framed those eyes in a very dramatic fashion‚Äîthough the dark brows made me speculate about how natural the blond hair might be. She wore no makeup and still managed to be very pretty in an ethereal, very natural way. With makeup and a little effort she‚Äôd have been a knockout. But it would have taken more than makeup and a better fit of clothes.  
  
¬† She sat huddled in the client chair, shoulders hunched as if waiting for a blow to fall. Her lovely eyes blinked at me like the eyes of a deer caught in headlights, as if she were powerless to stop what was happening, and what was happening was bad.  
  
¬† The other woman was tall, five feet eight inches or better, slender, with long pale brown hair that swung straight and shining to her waist. At first glance she seemed early twenty-something. Then I met her eyes and there was an intensity in their brown depths that made me add on ten years. You just didn‚Äôt get that look much before thirty. Her look was more confident than the blonde‚Äôs, but there was a flinching around her eyes, a tightness in her shoulders, as if something deep inside was hurting. There was also a delicacy of bone as if what lay under the skin had been formed of daintier things than mere bone. There is only one thing that can give a tall, commanding person that look of daintiness: she was part sidhe. Oh, it was a few generations back, nothing as intimate as my ties to the court, but somewhere a several-times-great-grandmother had lain down with something not human and walked away with a child. Fey blood of any kind marks a family, but sidhe  
blood seems to stay in the genes forever, as if once in the mix, it never gets cleaned out.  
  
¬† I was betting the blonde was the wife, and the other one the mistress. The blonde seemed the more beaten down of the two, which is usually the case with an abusive man. They may abuse all the women in their lives, but they‚Äôll usually save the best or worst for immediate family. My grandfather had always done it that way.  
  
¬† I came into the room smiling, hand out to shake hands, like they were any other clients. Jeremy made the introductions. The small blonde was the wife, Frances Norton; the tall brown-haired one was the mistress, Naomi Phelps.  
  
¬† Naomi‚Äôs handshake was firm, hand cool to the touch, those extraordinary bones moving under her skin. I held her hand just a little too long, luxuriating in the feel of her touch. It was the closest thing I‚Äôd had to another sidhe in three years. Even a touch of some other fey isn‚Äôt the same. There is something in the royal bloodline that is like some drug. Once tasted, you miss it.  
  
¬† She looked puzzled at me, and it was a very human puzzlement. I let her hand go and tried to pretend to be human. Some days I was better at it than this. Some days I was worse. I could have tried to get the measure of her psychically, to see if she had more than bone structure going for her, but it was impolite to try and read another person‚Äôs magical ability at first introduction. Among the sidhe it‚Äôs considered an open challenge, an insult that you don‚Äôt believe that the other person can shield himself from your most casual magic. Naomi probably wouldn‚Äôt have taken it as an insult, but her ignorance was no excuse for me to be rude.  
  
¬† Frances Norton held out her hand like she was afraid to be touched, the arm half bent so she could tuck it back into her body as soon as I was finished with it. I‚Äôd have given her the same polite treatment that I‚Äôd given the other woman, but with my fingers just above her skin I could feel the spell. That small line of energy that surrounds all of us, her aura, pushed against my skin like it was trying to keep me from touching her. Someone else‚Äôs magic was so thick in her body that it had filled her aura up like dirty water in a clean glass. In a way, the woman wasn‚Äôt herself anymore. It wasn‚Äôt possession, but it was a close cousin. It was certainly a violation of several human laws, all of them felonies.

¬† I forced my hand through that roil of energy, gripping her hand. The spell tried to surge through my skin up my arm. There was nothing to see with the eyes, but just as you can see things in your dreams, so I could sense a faint darkness trying to creep up my arm. I stopped it just below my elbow and had to concentrate on peeling it down my arm like stripping off a glove. It had breached my shields like they hadn‚Äôt been there. Not many things can do that. None of them human.  
  
¬† She was staring at me with wide, wide eyes. ‚ÄúWh . . . what are you doing?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing anything to you, Mrs. Norton.‚Äù My voice sounded a little detached, distant, because I was concentrating on peeling the spell off of me so that when I let go of her hand none of it would cling to me.  
  
¬† She tried to take her hand back, and I wouldn‚Äôt let her. She started to tug on it, weak but frantic. The other woman said, ‚ÄúLet Frances go, now.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was almost free, almost ready to let her go, when the other woman gripped my shoulder. The hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I lost concentration on my hand, because I could sense Naomi Phelps now. The spell poured back over my hand and was halfway to my shoulder before I could concentrate enough to stop it. But all I could do was stop it. I couldn‚Äôt push it back because too much of my attention was on the other woman.  
  
¬† You never touch someone while they‚Äôre working magic, or doing psychic stuff, unless you want something to happen. This more than anything told me that neither woman was a practitioner or an active psychic. No one with even minimal training would have done it. I could feel the remnants of some ritual clinging to Naomi‚Äôs body. Something complex. Something selfish. The thought that came unbidden to my mind was gluttony. Something had been feeding off of her energy, and it had left psychic scars behind.  
  
¬† She jerked back from me, cradling her hand against her chest. She‚Äôd sensed my energy, so she had talent. Not a big surprise. What was surprising was that she was untrained, maybe totally untrained. Nowadays they go into preschools and test people for psychic gifts, mystical talent, but it was a new program in the sixties. Naomi had managed not to be spotted, and now she was over thirty and still hadn‚Äôt dealt with her abilities. Most untrained psychics are either crazy, criminals, or suicides by the time they‚Äôre thirty. She had to be a very strong person to be as together as she looked. But this very strong woman looked at me with tears trembling in her eyes. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt come here to be abused.‚Äù  
  
¬† Jeremy had stepped closer to us, but was being careful not to touch any of us. He knew better. ‚ÄúNo one is abusing you, Ms. Phelps. The spell on Mrs. Norton tried to . . . leach onto my colleague. Ms. Gentry was merely trying to push the spell off of her when you touched her. You should never touch anyone when they‚Äôre working magic, Ms. Phelps. The results can be unpredictable.‚Äù  
  
¬† The woman looked from one to the other of us, and her face said clearly she didn‚Äôt believe us. ‚ÄúCome on, Frances. We‚Äôre getting the fuck out of here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù Frances said in a voice grown small and submissive. She was staring up at me, fear plain in her eyes, but it was fear of me.  
  
¬† She felt the energy wrapped around our hands, pressing us together, but she thought I was doing it. ‚ÄúI swear to you, Mrs. Norton, I am not doing this. Whatever magic has been used against you, it thinks I‚Äôm tasty. I need to peel it off of me and let it flow back into you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI want to get rid of it,‚Äù she said, voice high with a faint edge of hysteria trailing around the edges.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt pull it off of me, then whoever did this to you will be able to trace me. They‚Äôll be able to find me. They‚Äôll know that I work at a detective agency that specializes in supernatural problems, magical solutions.‚Äù It was our slogan. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll know that you came here for help. I don‚Äôt think you want that, Mrs. Norton.‚Äù  
  
¬† A fine trembling started in her hands and spread up her arms, until she stood there shivering as if she were cold. Maybe she was, but it wasn‚Äôt the kind of cold that an extra sweater would fix. No amount of outer warmth would cure the coldness inside. She‚Äôd have to be warmed from the damaged core of her soul out to her fingertips. Someone would have to pour power into her, magic into her, a little bit at a time, like thawing some ancient body found frozen in ice. If you thawed it too fast, you‚Äôd cause more damage than if you just left it alone. Such delicate use of power was beyond my abilities. All I could have done was give her a measure of calmness, taken some of her fear‚Äîbut whoever laid the spell on her would sense that, too. They wouldn‚Äôt be able to trace me by it, but they‚Äôd know she‚Äôd been to see a practitioner, someone who‚Äôd tried to help her on a psychic level. Call it a hunch, but whoever laid the spell wouldn‚Äôt like that. They might do something rash, like speed up the process.  
  
¬† I could feel the sucking energy of the spell, trying to breech my defenses, to feed on me, too. It was like magical cancer, but as easy to catch as the flu. How many people had she infected? How many people were walking around with this spell draining little bits of their energy? Someone who was only a little bit psychic might know something had happened, but not what. They‚Äôd avoid Frances Norton because she‚Äôd hurt them, but they might not realize for weeks, months, that the tiredness, the vague feelings of hopelessness, the depression, were being caused by a spell.  
  
¬† I started to tell her what I was about to do, but staring into her wide eyes, I didn‚Äôt bother. She‚Äôd just tense up, be more afraid. The best I could do was make it as invisible to her as possible. I would try to make sure she didn‚Äôt feel it slide back inside her, but that was the best I could do.  
  
¬† The spell had grown thicker, blacker, more real, just from those few extra moments of sitting against my skin. I began to peel it down my arm. It clung like tar, and it took a lot more concentration to push it back, rolling it back on itself like thick cloth. Every inch of my skin that I freed up felt lighter, cleaner. I could not imagine living totally encased in this thing. It would be like going through your entire life faintly oxygen-deprived, shoved in a dark room, where the light never came.  
  
¬† I had freed my arm, my hand, and began to slowly pull my fingers away from her hand. She stayed utterly still against my skin like a rabbit hiding in the grass, hoping desperately that the fox will pass her by if only she can lie quiet enough. What I don‚Äôt think Frances Norton realized yet was that she was halfway down the fox‚Äôs throat, with her little legs kicking in the air.  
  
¬† When I pulled my fingers away, the spell clung to them, and then fell back into place around her with an almost audible sound. I wiped my hand on my jacket. I was clear of the spell, but I had a terrible urge to wash my hand with very hot water and lots of soap. Ordinary water and soap wouldn‚Äôt help, but some salt or holy water might.  
  
¬† She collapsed into the chair, hiding her face in her hands, shoulders shaking. I thought at first she was crying without making any noise. But when Naomi hugged her, she raised a face devoid of tears. Frances was shaking, just shaking, as if she couldn‚Äôt cry anymore, not because she didn‚Äôt want to, but because all the tears had been drained out of her. She sat there while her husband‚Äôs mistress hugged her, rocked her. She was shaking so badly her teeth began to chatter, but she never cried. It seemed worse somehow because she didn‚Äôt cry.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExcuse us for a moment, ladies. We‚Äôll be right outside,‚Äù I said. I looked at Jeremy and headed for the door, knowing he‚Äôd follow. In the hallway he closed the door behind us.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Merry. I shook her hand, and nothing happened. The spell didn‚Äôt react to me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded. I believed him. ‚ÄúMaybe I just taste better.‚Äù  
  
¬† He grinned at me. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know from experience, but I‚Äôd almost bet on it.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled. ‚ÄúPhysically, maybe, but mystically, you‚Äôre as powerful in your own way as I am. Lord and Lady, you‚Äôre a better magician than I‚Äôll ever be, yet it didn‚Äôt react to you.‚Äù  
  
¬† He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, it didn‚Äôt. Maybe you‚Äôre right, Merry. Maybe it‚Äôs too dangerous for you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I frowned at him. ‚ÄúNow he gets cautious.‚Äù  
  
&n  
bsp; He looked at me, fighting to make his face neutral. ‚ÄúWhy do I get the feeling that you‚Äôre not going to be the cold-hearted bitch I was hoping for?‚Äù  
  
¬† I leaned against the far wall and glared at him. ‚ÄúThis thing is so malignant that we‚Äôll be able to get some police help.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBringing in the police won‚Äôt save them. We don‚Äôt have enough to prove it‚Äôs the husband. If we can‚Äôt prove it in court, he doesn‚Äôt do jail time, and that means he‚Äôd be free to work more magic on them. We need him locked away in a warded cell where he can‚Äôt harm them.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd need magical protection until he was in custody. This isn‚Äôt just a detective job. It‚Äôs a baby-sitting job.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUther and Ringo are great babysitters,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStill not happy. Why?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe should walk away from this one,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt do it,‚Äù he said. He was smiling now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I can‚Äôt do it.‚Äù There were lots of detective agencies in the United States that said they specialized in supernatural cases. It was big business, the preternatural, but most agencies couldn‚Äôt back up their advertising. We could. We were one of only a handful of agencies that could boast a staff made up entirely of magic practitioners and psychics. We were also the only one that could boast that all but two employees were fey. There aren‚Äôt that many full-blooded fey who can stand to live in a big, crowded city. L.A. was better than New York or Chicago, but it was still exhausting to be surrounded by so much metal, so much technology, so many humans. It didn‚Äôt bother me. My human blood allowed me human tolerances for steel and glass prisons. Culturally and personally, I preferred the country, but I didn‚Äôt have to have it. It was nice, but I didn‚Äôt sicken and fade without it. Some fey would.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wish I could turn them away, Jeremy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a bad feeling about this one, too, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù But if I cast them out, I‚Äôd see her trembling, tearless face in my dreams. For all I knew, they might come back to haunt me after whoever was killing them finished the job. They could come back as righteous ghosts and bemoan me for having knowingly taken their last chance at survival away. People always think ghosts haunt the people who actually killed them, but that‚Äôs just not true. Ghosts seem to have an interesting sense of justice, and it would be just my luck to have them following me around until I could find someone to lay them. If they could be laid. Sometimes spirits were tougher than that. Then you could end up with a family ghost like a banshee howling at every death. I doubted either woman had that kind of strength of character, but it would have served me right if they had. It was my own sense of guilt that made me walk back into that office, not fear of ghostly reprisals. Some people say that the fey have no souls, no sense of personal responsibility. For some that‚Äôs true, but it wasn‚Äôt true for Jeremy, and it wasn‚Äôt true for me. More‚Äôs the pity sometimes. More‚Äôs the pity.  
  
¬† Chapter 3  
  
¬† NAOMI PHELPS DID MOST OF THE TALKING WHILE FRANCES SAT THERE AND shivered. Our secretary got her hot coffee and an afghan. Her hands shook so badly that she spilled coffee on the afghan, but she got some of it down. Whether it was the warmth or the caffeine, she looked a little better.  
  
¬† Jeremy had called Teresa in to listen to the women. Teresa was our resident psychic. She was two inches shy of six feet, slender, with high sculpted cheekbones, long silky black hair, skin the color of pale coffee. The first time I‚Äôd seen her, I‚Äôd known she had sidhe blood in her, along with African American, and something fey that hadn‚Äôt been high court. The last was what gave her the slight points to the tops of her ears. A lot of faerie wanna-bes get cartilage implants to make their ears pointy. They grow their hair down to their ankles and try to pretend to be sidhe. But no pure-blooded sidhe has ever had pointed ears. It‚Äôs a mark of mixed blood, less than pure. But some bits of folklore die harder than others. To a vast majority of people if you were truly sidhe, you had to have pointed ears.  
  
¬† Teresa had that same delicacy of bone that Naomi did, but I‚Äôd never been tempted to hold Teresa‚Äôs hand. She was one of the most powerful touch clairvoyants that I‚Äôd ever met. I spent a goodly amount of energy making sure she didn‚Äôt touch me for fear that she‚Äôd learn my secrets and endanger us all. She sat in a chair to one side, dark eyes watching the two women. She hadn‚Äôt offered to shake their hands. In fact she‚Äôd walked wide around them so that she didn‚Äôt accidentally touch either of them. Her face betrayed nothing, but she‚Äôd felt the spell, the danger, when she walked into the room.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many mistresses he‚Äôs had,‚Äù Naomi was saying, ‚Äúa dozen, two dozen, hundreds.‚Äù She shrugged. ‚ÄúAll I know for sure is that I‚Äôm the latest in a long line of them.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMrs. Norton,‚Äù Jeremy said.  
  
¬† Frances turned her eyes up to him, startled, as if she hadn‚Äôt expected to be asked to contribute to the story.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you have any proof of all these women?‚Äù  
  
¬† She swallowed, and said in a voice that was almost a whisper, ‚ÄúPolaroids, he keeps Polaroids.‚Äù She stared down into her lap, murmuring, ‚ÄúHe calls them his trophies.‚Äù  
  
¬† I had to ask. ‚ÄúDid he show these pictures to you, or did you find them?‚Äù  
  
¬† She looked up, and her eyes were empty‚Äîno anger, no shame, empty. ‚ÄúHe showed them to me. He likes . . . he likes to tell me about what he‚Äôs done with them. What each one is good at, better at than me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I opened my mouth, closed it, because I couldn‚Äôt think of a single helpful thing to say. I was outraged for her sake, but it was Francis Norton that needed to be angry on behalf of Francis Norton. My anger might help us solve the immediate problem, but it wouldn‚Äôt make her strong again. If we could take the husband out of the picture, that wouldn‚Äôt heal all the damage he‚Äôd done. There was a lot more wrong with Francis than just a spell.  
  
¬† Naomi touched her arm, comforting her. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how she met me. She saw my picture, and then we just ran into each other one day. I caught her staring at me in a restaurant. He had woken her when he got home and told her what he‚Äôd done to me.‚Äù It was Naomi‚Äôs turn to look down into her lap, her hands lying upright and empty against her legs. ‚ÄúI had bruises showing.‚Äù She looked up, met my eyes. ‚ÄúFrances came over to my table. She rolled back her sleeve and showed me her bruises. Then she just said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm his wife.‚Äô And that was how we met.‚Äù She gave a shy smile at the last, the sort of smile you give when you‚Äôve explained how you met your lover. A tender story to be related to others.  
  
¬† I gave her blank eyes, but I wondered if the bond between them was more than just the abuse and the husband. If they were lovers, it could change how the healing was done. So often in mystical things the emotions have to be taken into account. Because love and hate have different energies, you work with them differently. We‚Äôd need to know exactly what the bond between the two women was before serious healing work was begun, but not today. Today we‚Äôd listen to what they wanted to tell us.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was very brave of you,‚Äù Teresa said. Her voice, like everything about her, was somehow soft and feminine with an underlying strength, like steel covered by silk. I‚Äôd always thought Teresa, though she‚Äôd never traveled farther south than Mexico, would have made an excellent Southern belle.  
  
¬† Frances‚Äôs eyes flicked to her, then back to her lap, then up, and her mouth moved. It was almost a smile. That one small movement made me feel better about the woman. If she could begin to smile, begin to take pride in what strength she‚Äôd shown, then maybe she would be all right with time.  
  
¬† Naomi squeezed her arm and gave her smile of pride and affection. Again, I got the impression that they were very close. ‚ÄúIt was my salvation. From the moment that I met Frances, I started trying to break away from him. I don‚Äôt know how I allowed him to hurt me. I‚Äôm not like that. I mean, I‚Äôve never, ever let a man abuse me.‚Äù Her face showed the shame she felt, as if she should have saved herself.  
  
¬† Frances put her hand over the other woman‚Äôs hand, giving comfort as well as getting it.  
  
&n  
bsp; Naomi smiled at her, then turned puzzled eyes to us. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like a drug. Once he‚Äôs touched you, you crave his touch. Not just him either. It‚Äôs like he wakens you sexually, until your body aches to be touched.‚Äù She looked down again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been so sexually aware of other people. It was embarrassing, and exciting, at first. Then he started to hurt me. At first it was just little things, tying me up, then . . . spanking.‚Äù She made herself look up, forced herself to meet our eyes. Such anger, as if defying us to think the worst of her. There was a great deal of strength here. How had this man tamed her? ‚ÄúHe made the pain part of the pleasure, but then he started doing worse things. Things that just hurt. I tried to get him to stop the kinky stuff, and that‚Äôs when he started beating me for real, no pretending that it was part of sex.‚Äù Her mouth trembled, eyes still defiant. ‚ÄúBut beating me did excite him. The fact that it didn‚Äôt excite me, that it scared me, he liked that, too.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRape fantasies,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† She nodded, her eyes wide as she tried to keep the tears glistening in her eyes from falling. She held herself very still, trying to hold it all inside. ‚ÄúNot just fantasies at the end.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe likes to take you by force.‚Äù This from the wife.  
  
¬† I looked at both of them and fought the urge to shake my head. I‚Äôd spent the years from sixteen to thirty in the Unseelie Court, the years of my sexual awakening, so I knew about combining pleasure with pain. But the pain was shared, and it was never done against anyone‚Äôs will. If the other person didn‚Äôt think pain was pleasurable, it wasn‚Äôt sex. It was torture. There is a vast difference between torture and a little hard sex. But for sexual sadists, there is no difference. In the extreme forms they are incapable of sex without the violence, or at least the terror of their victim. But most sadists are capable of more normal sex. They can use that to fool you, but in the end they can‚Äôt keep up a normal relationship. In the end what they truly desire must come out, and they must have it.

1lmvx44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lmvx44/aio_clinging_by_a_thread_ive_hurt_the_person_i/,"AIO - Clinging by a thread, I've hurt the person I love the most","Hello,

I don't know what I'm searching for in this post. I am a 25 year old DE transitioning female (was ftm). I am losing my shit- like I was about to hang myself last night.

My current boyfriend(?) is my first and only love I've ever had. We met through my brother years ago and I used to cut and dye his hair for a couple of redbulls. But we slowly got involved with each other.

I was still married when we started seeing each other. My marriage was already pretty much over- my ex husband cheated on me and I couldn't move past it. I my husband knew what was going on between us and let him know when I was with him. I ended it when me and my current boyfriend started getting serious- he asked me to be his girlfriend and I was head over heels for him at that point and started filing for divorce. I will refer to my current boyfriend as J and my ex husband as D.

Now for the full story- total brutal honesty.

Me and J were kind of hanging around each other and he was spending the night ever once and a while. Not sleeping together just letting him crash. Until one night, I owed the dude money. I still do- now I just owe him a lot more. But he crawled into bed with me and I though he was crashing like usual but then he started kissing me. I was still ftm at the time and married- so I paused and said I had to think for a moment. My husband D, had cheated on me three weeks after we got married, he was in prison and he got solitary and a ticket for it. Which is how I found out. He was also heavy addicted to narcotics and I was struggling trying to pay the bills and he asked for money for drugs all the time- I valued that he was honest( I should have never gave him money). I was in a lot of pain. I wanted to feel wanted- and I felt like I owed him. So, I agreed and slept with him.

I wasn't bad, but for the first time in a long time, I felt like I was good enough for someone. After the deed he let me know, that it was just a quick fuck- that he just was horny. Man, I tried my best to act tough- but fuck man. He kept coming back to sleep with me, but he was always talking about other girls and dates. I don't know but I just kept being with him- mind you I tried to keep my focus on repairing my marriage. I just couldn't forgive. Funny now, as J is struggling to forgive me now.

I tried pushing him away tried being annoying. But he just kept being this person I admired, and my act slowly faded, not that I can prove anything about how I was feeling. I was scared and felt alone. He would tell me I was just a hole to fuck, that he didn't give a shit about me, ect. ect. I stayed anyways- I genuinely started to love him. He was a smart and funny person. I knew that it was because of who I was- that he hated me. I started to change, i started to de-transition. J is a straight man and I transitioned with top surgery and hormones in 2015 and by the time we started getting together it was 2023. Changes are irreversible, but god I started to falls so hard. I tried to follow everything he said he liked. He would check out other girls in front of me and I wished if I could just look like that. It became my biggest obsession and to this day it is dominates my mind. 

He would say that he missed boobs and and tell me what he didn't like about my body and face. Lips to small- nose to big, dress like trash- he bought me clothes that he liked on me. I know maybe he was being nice buying me clothes. But I felt like maybe if I could keep trying to be the person he like he would like me.

I have a lying problem- and yes, I deserve all the hate. This is why I am on a thread.

He came after me about it and for a while I didn't lie to him until- i lied to one of my friend that I owed money too. I moved to a new city to be with him and left my rent to own home back where I came. She helped me pay rent for 2 months because the friends I had moved in order to have them pay rent when I was gone didn't pay. I lied to her. He found out, it turned ugly. I stopped lying for a while.

(J)He was never the same since- it's my fault- I know.

I'm begging to be in a relationship with someone who will never be able to love me, and yet I understand why. I'm not mad at him. I was always mad at myself. 

I lied again while i was going through my divorce, I sent my ex husband money- I genuinely thought it was mine but it was his that he put into my account for safe keeping. I am evil. I sent the money to his D's mother- but I know it went to him, she said she needed help and I don't know maybe I felt guilty for leaving. I thought that when I got paid I'll just put it back. He found out before then. 

Fast forward and I have continued to hide things- because he gets so mad and he always threatens to break up we have probably broken up a few times ever single time he gets angry and I try to be better and I fail.

He has made my self esteem go down, my fears go up and now I can't stop hiding things because it doesnt feel safe.

Last week I was talking to my mother. We own a house together now, and he over heard my mom say that she thinks he pimping me out because all he plays is video games and I work and pay the bills.

I didn't tell her that I agreed to pay the bills for a year, because he paid for most my stuff when I first moved to the new city with him.

He drove us to my parents house to talk to my parents, it didn't end well he broke up with me again, saying I make him look like a deadbeat. I was honest during our conversation as he said all of his friends have turned against him. I let him know it's because he yells at me and insults me Infront of them. They always pull me aside and ask me if I'm okay. I always said yes and defended him, saying I love him.

J says he isolated now. But I feel like it reversed ad he made so many comments about women I don't trust him around if i had a female friend. He doesn't want me to have guy friends either. He hates when I reach out to my family as he says it weird, or when I talk to my mom about how he isn't dating  my mother. Who strongly disagrees with his actions- because he doesn't work he has a lot of money saved up- but its hard when I'm struggling to keep a job because of depression and self hatred. I hate my body and myself so much I can't do anything but collapse into myself. He also always want to go on trips which my bosses hate- or wants me to call out, or makes me run late frequently- wakes me up throughout the night to cook for him. 

I want to be as loving as possible make his life easy. I hide things though like bills, or problems I'm having. But they always explode and then the verbal degradation begins. He says I'm a narcissist- he is most likely right, I've been obsessed with figuring out what being a narcissist means and I do have some traits. I tend to be bad at apologies, I say sorry - but I don't apologize right. I start to shut down every time there's conflict between us because i feel my heart shattering when he tells me how awful I am, but shutting down is emotional abuse I understand now. I double speak to much, I thought i was trying to defend myself. You know not just take the attack- but i understand that was defensive. My worst trait is sometimes I don't fully hold myself accountable. 

I know its because I have a bit of resentment for the way he's treated me, when I was doing everything right. So, I am like why does it matter, if I'm going to be ignored and he plays video games for hours and talks to his friends online all night long. But Its not right of me to be that way.

I don't know how to fix things. I am an awful person. J says I'm a narcissist and he is probably right. I lie and hide things. I made him look bad by not telling my parents about our agreement-

But now I also found out he has been watching a lot of porn with pretty girls with big tits- and I felt the life leave me. Because he stopped sleeping with me, maybe once every few months after I practically beg. I feel so beaten down.

I tried working so hard and paying the bills, I do all the cleaning and the laundry, I take care of the house and the dogs. I cooked every day, even though I'm a shitty cook I kept trying because he loves food. I give hi daily massages- but I can't tell the fucking truth. 

I was married, but I was never in love until I met him. I was a POS in most cases in my life and I am trying so hard. I got scheduled for breast reconstruction and have gone to laser hair removal almost every month and when I missed them it was because I couldn't afford it ad he was mad I missed them because i know he hates the way I look and my body and I'm doing everything I can to change it. I know my personality is like a dumpster fire- but I swear that I only lied to him because i didn't want him to have to fix my problems I thought I could fix myself. I never could and then he was putting out the fires by paying for my shit, paying bills I couldn't even bring myself to tell him about because I'm to scared of telling him how much I'm failing. I am so self centered that I can't ask for help, I feel so guilty and so remorse full that He has to put up with me. He told me he regrets being with me and I can't blame him.

Yesterday I knew he was talking to a girl on discord, and I found his phone had reddit porn. I lost my shit- I went do what i do when I can't self soothe I drink and or get high and listen to music- but something fucking  snapped in me while I was washing dishes. I grabbed a coffee mug- he was upstairs gaming as usual. So, un witness i felt for the first time- that it was unfair and I through it at the bathroom door like a fucking child throwing a tantrum.  I watched it smash, I knew he heard it- I felt bad and cleaned it up quietly. I went for a walk to calm down because I was still not calm. When I got home I couldn't stop sobbing and my god am I such a child- I started sobbing even more because i realized that I was being manipulative again by crying so loud but I couldn't stop sobbing.- I tried to muffle with a pillow but I was to damn loud I went to lay on the bathroom floor. I do that when I feel awful, a habit since I was a kid. I know that doing that is manipulative, but I just wanted to feel better I wanted to sleep. He told me to go lay in bed when he took a break to pee and to stop doing that shit. All my narcissistic stupid fucking brain could say was ""k."" and i went upstairs and continued to sob. 

We really talked or been over what happened with my mother and father. He has sounded pleasant a few  times and I get excited to talk to him and but I know he's just trying to be nice. So, all i can do is look at the ground and remind myself he just wants me to be curt. So, I do, but I cant fake a smile, I can't relax- my heart has been beating so loud in my chest and I feel like I can't breathe.

All I want is to love him with my whole heart- all I do is self sabotage, I will do anything for him not to be angry with me. I just don't want him angry. 

I've isolated him from his friends because i didn't stand up for myself when he was mean by saying this is is sense of humor. I hide things so he wouldn't get angry, and I left out information to my parents about our agreement about bills.

I would do anything for him to stay, but I always hurt him again and again.

If all I ever do is hurt everyone around me, I think I deserve to die. What 25 year old throws a mug because they found porn on there boyfriends phone? 

I'm evil, and I don't want to be.

Any Advice?,"For some context around this time last year I went through an absolutely nuclear blowout breakup with an abusive narcissist that started with an apocalyptic fight this week last year and got dragged out for *3 more months* until I finally called it quits. For the last few weeks i‚Äôve been battling a depressive episode. A few days ago was the night of the (first part of the) fight and i just felt miserable and sick the whole day. 

While i‚Äôve been mentally prepping for it, i feel like it‚Äôs really kicking my ass far more than expected. I‚Äôm especially struggling with what i think is hyper vigilance and aftershocks of the panic attacks i was having this time a year ago. Im not really ruminating on the events or even having flashbacks, but my body feels like it‚Äôs just reacting on a schedule. 

Today in a coffee shop i started hyperventilating out of nowhere, i still kind of feel like it is hard to breathe. When i went and checked my old text messages, another fight was starting down to the *minute* my symptoms started. I‚Äôve never had such a bad ‚Äúthe body keeps the score‚Äù kind of reaction with anniversaries before. Maybe it‚Äôs because with other trauma anniversaries i have spent more time coping with and preparing for. I feel really blindsided by this and i‚Äôm not sure what to do. The fights were really unbearable and recurred until the end of August. I‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll adjust, but if anyone has advice about how to manage the out of nowhere panic symptoms completely detached from emotions or flashbacks i would appreciate it.

Chapter 1: The Last Normal Day (pt.1)

The soft hum of morning filtered in through the thin curtains, streaks of warm sunlight striping the modest bedroom wall. A distant chorus of birdsong blended with the muffled rumble of passing cars. The old ceiling fan spun overhead, its gentle wobble making a rhythmic tick-tick-tick as it cut the air.
Cole Bennett lay sprawled on his back, the covers tangled around his waist. His breathing was slow and steady, lips slightly parted in the slack-jawed peace of deep sleep. The faint scent of engine grease lingered on his hands from the day before. 
A sudden weight shifted onto the mattress beside him.
‚ÄúCole,‚Äù Sarah‚Äôs voice was soft but insistent. Her hand pressed firmly on his chest, giving him a small shake. ‚ÄúHey, get up. You‚Äôre gonna be late.‚Äù
‚ÄúMmm.‚Äù Cole groaned, burying his face deeper into the pillow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already at work. Fixing dreams.‚Äù He smirked, eyes still closed.
Sarah sat back on her knees, arms folded. Her blonde hair was still a little wild from sleep, tucked behind her ears, and her oversized sweatshirt hung loose on her frame. Her eyes, gentle but sharp with resolve, scanned him like she was debating the best way to get him moving.
‚ÄúAlright, dream mechanic,‚Äù she said, leaning down until her face was inches from his ear. Her voice was all sweet venom. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get up, I‚Äôm making instant coffee.‚Äù
Cole‚Äôs eyes shot open. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù
Her grin widened. ‚ÄúOh, I would.‚Äù
He groaned like a man carrying the world on his shoulders and swung his legs off the bed, rubbing his face with both hands. ‚ÄúTyrant,‚Äù he muttered, casting her a playful glare.
‚ÄúLazy,‚Äù she shot back, standing and tossing a pair of jeans at his head. He caught them just before they hit his face.
He got dressed and lumbered himself to the kitchen, grinning as he watched her walk out of the bathroom, barefoot and graceful in that effortless way she always moved. It wasn‚Äôt fair, really. She was already dressed in her nurse‚Äôs scrubs, fresh and ready to face the world, while he still felt like a corpse dragging itself to life.
The kitchen was small but lived-in. Mismatched mugs hung from hooks under the cabinets. Bills and takeaway menus cluttered one end of the counter. A magnetic notepad on the fridge had ‚ÄúGET NOODLES‚Äù scrawled in Cole‚Äôs crooked handwriting. The old linoleum floor creaked in the same three spots every time you walked through it.
Sarah stood by the counter, pouring water into the coffee maker, her fingers moving with the practiced precision of someone used to routines. Her lips pressed together in quiet concentration, like this was a vital step in her daily mission. Cole watched her from the doorway for a second, appreciating how she could make even something as ordinary as making coffee look like an art form.
‚ÄúMilk‚Äôs still good, right?‚Äù she asked, lifting the carton from the fridge.
‚ÄúDefine ‚Äògood,‚Äô‚Äù Cole replied, tugging his T-shirt down as he walked around her.
She popped the cap, sniffed it, and winced. ‚ÄúUgh, no. It‚Äôs not good. It‚Äôs dead.‚Äù She held it out toward him like it might explode.
‚ÄúJust a little chunky,‚Äù Cole teased, reaching for a mug. ‚ÄúAdds texture.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare.‚Äù Her eyes narrowed as she tossed the milk in the trash, in one smooth motion.
They shared a look, and he couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. She shook her head but didn‚Äôt hide the tiny smile that tugged at the corner of her lips.
‚ÄúGrab me one too,‚Äù she said, nodding toward the mugs.
He picked a new one from the cabinet ‚Äî a bright orange mug that said, World‚Äôs Okayest Nurse ‚Äî and handed it to her.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you get enough of this at work?‚Äù he asked, gesturing to the slogan.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a nurse, Cole,‚Äù she said with mock seriousness. ‚ÄúOkay is a win.‚Äù
He chuckled, nudging her with his elbow as he grabbed his own mug. His was black, chipped at the handle, and he‚Äôd claimed it as his own from the moment they bought it at a yard sale.
As they ate breakfast, ‚Äî eggs, toast, and the last of a jar of peach preserves ‚Äî the gentle quiet of morning started to shift.
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt close the garage door last night,‚Äù Sarah said casually, sipping her coffee.
‚ÄúYeah, I did,‚Äù Cole replied, glancing up at her.
‚ÄúNo, you didn‚Äôt,‚Äù she said, tilting her head, her tone matter-of-fact but not accusatory. ‚ÄúI saw it open this morning.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay, well, I thought I closed it,‚Äù he said, scraping the last bit of yolk from his plate. ‚ÄúClose.‚Äù
‚Äú‚ÄòClose isn‚Äôt actually closed, Cole,‚Äù she said, her brow raising.
‚ÄúOkay, okay,‚Äù he said, holding his hands up in surrender. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check it tonight.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôll close it tonight,‚Äù she corrected, smiling behind her mug.
‚ÄúBossy today, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù He grinned as he rinsed his plate.
‚ÄúJust keeping you honest,‚Äù she replied, standing up to clear her spot.
Her fingers brushed his arm as she passed by, a small, unconscious touch that had become part of their routine. For a moment, he watched her as she moved, that steady grace in her every step. He was suddenly hit with the realization of how easily he could see the next forty years of mornings just like this. Quiet bickering. Shared coffee. Small touches that said, I‚Äôm here. I see you.
He smiled to himself.
As they headed out, the chill of early spring bit at his neck as he stood on the front steps, zipping up his gray work jacket. The world still smelled like thawing earth, sharp and damp. The distant rumble of a lawnmower echoed through the neighborhood, blending with the chirping of birds. A dog barked from somewhere down the block.
Sarah locked the door behind them, tucking her keys into her bag. Her scrubs were light blue, and her coat barely reached past her hips. She pulled it tight around herself, shivering. ‚ÄúFeels colder than yesterday,‚Äù she muttered.
‚ÄúSpring,‚Äù Cole replied, stuffing his hands in his jacket pockets. ‚ÄúAll bark, no bite.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou say that every year,‚Äù she said, glancing at him with a small smile.

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm right every year.‚Äù He shot her a wink.
The street was alive with morning movement ‚Äî a car backing out of a driveway, a man jogging with his dog, the mail carrier stopping to sort letters. It was ordinary, every bit of it.
Their cars were parked side by side in the driveway. His old red pickup, a little rusty around the edges, and her gray sedan, still clean from its last car wash. They shared a glance, knowing this was the point where they‚Äôd part for the day.
‚ÄúText me if you‚Äôre staying late,‚Äù she said, brushing her hand against his.
‚ÄúText me if you get famous,‚Äù he shot back, stepping toward his truck.
She, shook her head, but she lingered for a second longer.
They stood like that for a beat, just watching each other in the still air of morning. Then she moved toward her car, pulling open the door.
‚ÄúLove you, bossy pants,‚Äù he called over his shoulder.
‚ÄúLove you too, dream mechanic,‚Äù she shot back, climbing in.
The engines started almost in unison, a brief roar of life cutting through the stillness of the street. Cole pulled out first, watching her in his rearview mirror as she checked her mirrors, her fingers drumming lightly on the steering wheel.
He turned down the street, letting out a long breath as the day stretched ahead of him. Just another day. Another morning.
But for some reason, something about it looked heavier than usual.
He shook it off, tapping the steering wheel to a beat only he could hear. Work was waiting, cars didn‚Äôt fix themselves.
The old red pickup rattled like an overworked washing machine as it rolled down the cracked filled streets of Omaha. The early spring sun hovered low in the sky, bathing everything in a soft gold glow. Bare branches swayed in the breeze, their first buds of green just starting to peek through. The air had that crisp, clean bite that came after months of gray winter skies.
Cole rested one hand on the steering wheel, tapping a rhythm against it with his fingers. Turning on the radio low ‚Äî an old rock station cycling through the classics. Bob Segers‚Äô voice hummed along, lazy and familiar.
He yawned, blinking hard as he squinted at the road ahead. Could‚Äôve used one more cup of coffee, he thought. His eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, catching a glimpse of his stubbly jaw and the faint circles under his eyes. Ain‚Äôt getting old, yet buddy, he told himself with a smirk.
The drive wasn‚Äôt long, but it wasn‚Äôt short either ‚Äî just long enough to let his mind wander. He passed rows of single-story houses, each one with its own quirks: a garden gnome army guarding a front lawn, a broken porch swing hanging on one chain, an American flag fluttering in the wind. A man was unloading bags of mulch from his truck, his son handing him one bag at a time like it was a great mission.
Cole‚Äôs eyes lingered on them as he drove past. Simple stuff. Normal stuff. The kind of everyday life that didn‚Äôt get a second thought ‚Äî except maybe today, when everything felt just a little off.
He frowned, glancing around at the street ahead. Traffic lights swayed lightly on their cables, the red glow blinking in the early light. A car sat at the intersection, idling longer than it should‚Äôve before slowly pulling away. No honking. No rush. Just a slow, heavy stillness.
‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù he muttered to himself. Feels weird today.
He shook it off and focused back on the road. Everyone had off days. Maybe it was just Monday‚Äôs ghost hanging around on a Tuesday.
By the time he pulled into the lot behind Danner‚Äôs Auto Repair, he‚Äôd mostly forgotten about it. The gravel crunched under his tires as he parked next to a familiar rusted-out Honda that had been there since winter.
The garage smelled like oil, burnt rubber, and old coffee ‚Äî the holy trinity of every auto shop in America. Fluorescent lights buzzed softly overhead, their flicker almost imperceptible unless you stared too long. Half the concrete floor was stained with old spills, black spots where oil had soaked in forever.
‚Äú‚ÄòBout time you showed up,‚Äù Barry called out from under the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu. His voice was muffled, words bouncing off the engine block. His steel-toe boot tapped a slow rhythm against the tire.
‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I‚Äôm five whole minutes late. Call the feds,‚Äù Cole shot back, hanging his jacket on the hook by the wall.
‚ÄúFive minutes turns into ten, ten turns into twenty,‚Äù Barry grunted, wiping his hands on a rag. His face appeared from under the hood, his salt-and-pepper beard scruffy and wild. He squinted at Cole like a dad catching his kid sneaking in past curfew.
‚ÄúRelax, Barry,‚Äù Cole said, pulling on his work gloves. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt like the cars are gonna walk off without me.‚Äù
Barry snorted, as he ducked back under the hood. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt test that, man.‚Äù
The work started like it always did. Oil changes. Filter replacements. Brake pads. The mundane rhythm of bolts turning, ratchets clicking, and the occasional clang of a dropped wrench. Cole‚Äôs hands moved automatically, his mind half-focused, half-drifting. Muscle memory. You did something enough times, it became part of you.
Around lunchtime, Barry flipped on the small TV mounted in the corner.
Static. Then the screen blinked to life, showing a news anchor in a too-tight suit and a too-serious expression.
‚ÄúMore updates coming in from the East Coast,‚Äù the anchor was saying, his face lined with concern. ‚ÄúReports of violent clashes continue to pour in. Police are urging people to stay inside as emergency response teams struggle to contain the situation.‚Äù
The footage cut to shaky cell phone video: a blurry street filled with people running in all directions. Sirens blared in the distance. A crowd shoved against a police barricade, voices shouting and screaming over each other. Someone threw something ‚Äî a bottle, maybe ‚Äî and it shattered near an officer‚Äôs feet.
‚ÄúRiot season starting early this year,‚Äù Barry muttered, munching on a pear. He wiped his fingers on his pants and leaned on the workbench, watching the TV with the dull interest of a man who‚Äôd seen it all before.
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs that at?‚Äù Cole asked, glancing up from under a car.
‚ÄúNew York, I think,‚Äù Barry replied, squinting at the screen. ‚ÄúOr maybe Philly. They all look the same.‚Äù
Cole ducked back down, tightening the last bolt on the oil pan. ‚ÄúAlways something, huh?‚Äù
‚ÄúAlways,‚Äù Barry agreed. ‚ÄúBetcha ten bucks by tomorrow they‚Äôll blame it on video games.‚Äù
‚ÄúOr the economy,‚Äù Cole added, grinning as he slid out from under the car.
They both laughed, the easy, tired kind of laugh that comes from men tired of bad news. By the time the TV switched to weather, neither of them was paying attention.
By the end of the shift, Cole was ready to be home. His body ached from leaning over engines all day, his hands slick with the stubborn, never-quite-clean feel of grease. He stood by the sink scrubbing his palms, digging the bristles of the brush into his fingernails. No matter how much he scrubbed, some of it always stayed.
‚ÄúSee you tomorrow,‚Äù Barry called as he waved him off, already pulling a tarp over the Malibu.
‚ÄúUnless I win the lottery,‚Äù Cole called back, tossing his gloves into his toolbox.
‚ÄúYeah, keep dreaming, Cole.‚Äù
Cole grinned, pulling his jacket on as he stepped outside. The sun was lower now, casting long shadows across the lot. He slid into his truck, the seat creaking under his weight. The ignition caught on the second turn, engine sputtering to life like it had just woken up too.
The drive home started normal. But then‚Äî
He noticed it.
The quiet.
Not the peaceful kind. The kind that feels wrong.
There were fewer cars on the road. Usually, the 4:30 traffic meant a slow crawl past the row of strip malls, fast-food joints, and gas stations. Today, it was eerily empty. No brake lights ahead of him. No one trying to merge last second.
A man on a bicycle rode down the middle of the street like he owned it, glancing over his shoulder once, then twice, like he expected someone to yell at him. But no one did.
Cole‚Äôs hand went to the radio. Static. He turned the knob until he caught a voice: ‚Äú‚Ä¶power outages‚Ä¶ no word yet from emergency response teams‚Ä¶ stay inside‚Ä¶ repeat, stay inside‚Ä¶‚Äù
His fingers hovered over the dial. A sinking feeling settled in his gut.
Up ahead, a man stood at the corner of the intersection. Not crossing, just standing. His hoodie was up, his face hidden. He didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt look around, just stood there.
The truck rumbled past him, and Cole watched in his side mirror. The man didn‚Äôt move.
His fingers gripped the wheel tighter. He glanced at the houses on either side of the street. Curtains drawn. Empty driveways. Shadows shifting in second-story windows.
He cleared his throat, forcing himself to relax. ‚ÄúJust jumpy from that riot crap,‚Äù he muttered, tapping his thumb against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúNothing new. Just folks acting weird.‚Äù
But it didn‚Äôt feel like nothing. It felt like everything.
The knot in him twisted as he pulled into the driveway. His house looked the same as it had that morning. The lawn was still patchy. The porch light still flickered sometimes. Normal.
But his eyes stayed on the street a moment longer.
He didn‚Äôt know why.
Didn‚Äôt know what he was waiting for.
With a sigh, he killed the engine. The truck rattled to a stop, ticking softly as the metal cooled.
He pulled his jacket tighter and headed for the door.Behind him, the street stayed quiet.
Too quiet.
When Cole stepped inside, the familiar warmth of home hit him instantly. The scent of coffee and something sweet lingered in the air, and the quiet hum of the refrigerator was almost a comfort. Sarah was in the kitchen, leaning against the counter with a mug in hand, the steam curling upward. The yellow glow of the lamp by the sink cast a gentle light across her face, highlighting the delicate curve of her jaw and the soft lines of her lips.
She glanced up at him, a small smile tugging at them. ‚ÄúHow was work?‚Äù
Cole dropped his keys onto the counter and sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. ‚ÄúSame old, same old. Barry‚Äôs still a pain, but you know that.‚Äù He gave her a teasing grin, trying to shake off the unease that had been gnawing at him all day.
Sarah smiled warmly, her eyes soft and tired. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs not that bad.‚Äù
Cole pulled out a chair and sat down, looking at her for a long moment. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ felt off today. The whole damn day, Sarah. You notice how quiet it was on the streets? Like everyone just‚Ä¶ vanished.‚Äù
Sarah didn‚Äôt say anything at first, but she set her coffee down, her brow furrowing as she thought. ‚ÄúI did notice. It‚Äôs like the usual rush-hour noise was just‚Ä¶ gone.‚Äù
He leaned back, trying to shrug it off, but something inside him couldn‚Äôt ignore the gnawing feeling. He tried to make light of it, a habit that came too easily. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. Probably just people scared from whatever‚Äôs going on out East. You know how rumors spread.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Sarah murmured, but her voice didn‚Äôt quite carry the same conviction. She turned away, glancing out the window toward the street. The quiet hung in the air between them, thick and unnerving.
Before Cole could continue, the shrill ring of Sarah‚Äôs phone cut through the tension. She reached for it, her arm brushing against his briefly. He could feel the slight warmth of her skin, a touch that sent a pang through his chest.
‚ÄúSarah Bennett,‚Äù she answered, her voice professional, but there was a slight edge of concern.
Cole didn‚Äôt mean to eavesdrop, but he couldn‚Äôt help himself. He watched as Sarah‚Äôs eyes narrowed, her body tensing with the words she was hearing.
‚ÄúYeah, I understand,‚Äù she said, glancing at him for a moment before turning her attention back to the conversation. ‚ÄúHow many patients? I‚Äôll be there as soon as I can.‚Äù
She hung up quickly, her lips pursed.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Cole asked, his stomach sinking.
Sarah turned to face him, her expression tight. ‚ÄúThe ER is flooded. More patients than they expected. They need me there tonight.‚Äù
Cole‚Äôs heart skipped a beat. ‚ÄúNow?‚Äù he asked, his voice tight with concern.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a choice, Cole.‚Äù Sarah‚Äôs voice was soft but firm, her eyes pleading for him to understand. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre worried, but they‚Äôre short-staffed, and I‚Äôm the only nurse who can make it on such short notice.‚Äù
His stomach churned, a cold dread creeping up his spine. He stood, stepping toward her. ‚ÄúSarah, it‚Äôs not just the hospital. Something‚Äôs wrong out there. People don‚Äôt just stop commuting. It‚Äôs like‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù she interrupted, her tone gentle but resolute. She took his hands in hers, her fingers warm against his. ‚ÄúYou know we need the overtime. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù
He looked into her eyes, and for a moment, everything seemed to settle on his shoulders. He searched her eyes, tried to believe her. Maybe it was just nerves. Just a bad day. ‚ÄúPromise me you‚Äôll drive careful,‚Äù he said quietly, his voice almost a whisper.
Sarah nodded, her gaze softening. ‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù
She kissed him gently on the cheek and then hurriedly grabbed her bag from the entryway. She was already halfway out the door when she turned around, hand on the knob.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back as soon as I can. Call me if anything happens, okay?‚Äù
Cole nodded, though his throat felt tight. ‚ÄúI will.‚Äù
As the door clicked shut behind her, Cole stood frozen for a moment, staring at the empty space where she‚Äôd been. The quiet settled back in, but this time, it felt heavier. The sound of its silence was too much, and his mind began to race.
He tried watching TV. News, sitcoms, reruns‚Äînothing held. Static buzzed between channels. His mind kept drifting to Sarah. To the hospital. To the man on the street corner. The sounds of static and muffled news anchors only added to the gnawing feeling in his gut. He kept glancing at the clock, counting the minutes.
His mind kept returning to Sarah. What if she got caught in the chaos at the hospital? What if the same unrest from the East Coast riots had somehow spread this far? His thoughts twisted and turned, spiraling down dark paths he didn‚Äôt want to follow.
Every passing car made him sit up. Every silence made his chest ache.
Around midnight, he finally gave up on waiting for news, but he couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something wasn‚Äôt right. He pulled out his phone and dialed her number again, his thumb pressing hard on the screen.
It rang.
And rang.
Then voicemail. 
His heart sank as the beep echoed in his ear. ‚ÄúSarah, it‚Äôs me. Just checking in. Please call me when you get a chance.‚Äù
He ended the call and stared at the phone, feeling more helpless than ever. A cold chill seeped into his bones as the quiet of the night stretched on.
Hours passed. The world outside felt like it had frozen in time. He could feel the uncertainty hanging over him, heavier than anything he could carry.
The night dragged on, and Cole found himself alone with his thoughts, his stomach a constant knot of worry. What was going on? Where was Sarah? And why did everything feel so wrong?
Cole sat on the couch, his foot tapping an uneven rhythm against the floorboards. The television flickered quietly in front of him, its glow the only source of light in the room. He wasn‚Äôt watching, not really. The talking heads on the screen moved their mouths, but the words blurred into meaningless hums. Every so often, he‚Äôd glance at his phone on the coffee table, his eyes flickering to the black screen as if willing it to light up.
His hands rubbed over his face, fingers pressing hard into his eyes until bursts of color danced in the darkness. Calm down. She‚Äôs fine. She‚Äôs fine. But it was getting harder to believe it. She‚Äôd promised to call, and Sarah wasn‚Äôt the type to forget.
Minutes stretched into an hour. His phone sat motionless, a dead weight in the quiet house. The clock on the wall ticked with a metronomic patience, each second an accusation. You should‚Äôve told her to stay. You should‚Äôve made her stay.
He reached for the remote and flipped through the channels again, skipping past reruns, infomercials, and dull game shows. His finger hesitated on the news. He didn‚Äôt want to know ‚Äî but at the same time, he needed to know.
The headline at the bottom of the screen read: ‚ÄúUNREST SPREADING: RIOTS REPORTED IN MULTIPLE EAST COAST CITIES.‚Äù
The footage was shaky, captured on someone‚Äôs phone. Crowds pushed against police barricades, bottles flying, people screaming. A flash of movement, and a figure barreled through the line of riot police, swinging wildly. It didn‚Äôt look right ‚Äî the way the person moved, like a puppet on tangled strings. Cole sat forward, his eyes narrowing. The camera jolted as the person filming fell backward, catching only flashes of chaos before the screen cut to black.
Then, his phone lit up.
The vibration rattled against the wood of the coffee table, sharp and sudden. Cole snatched it up so fast he nearly dropped it. Sarah.
‚ÄúHey! Hey, I‚Äôm here,‚Äù he said, pressing the phone to his ear.
‚ÄúCole,‚Äù her voice came through, sharp and urgent, her breaths short and quick. Not her usual calm, even when things got hectic at the hospital. This was different. She sounded like she was running. ‚ÄúListen to me. Lock the doors. All of them. Right now.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Cole shot to his feet, his heart thudding in his chest. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? Sarah?‚Äù
‚ÄúJust lock them!‚Äù she snapped, her voice cracking with panic. He‚Äôd never heard her like that before. She always kept her cool. Always.
‚ÄúSarah, wait‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way. I‚Äôll be home soon.‚Äù Her voice pitched higher, almost drowned out by something in the background ‚Äî a distant, hollow thud-thud-thud like something heavy banging against a door. ‚ÄúLock everything, Cole. Do it now. Do it now!‚Äù
The line went dead.
‚ÄúSarah? Sarah!‚Äù he barked into the phone, pulling it away to see the call had ended. He tapped her name and hit Call Back. The phone rang once. Twice. Then the robotic voice informed him the call could not be completed as dialed. He stared at the screen, his heart beating harder than it should.
‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he muttered, trying again. Nothing. No dial tone. No ringing. Just the dead air of a dropped line.
His breathing came shallow and fast as he lowered the phone, his eyes darting around the house like it had suddenly become unfamiliar. The faint hum of the fridge, the tick of the clock, and the buzz of the TV filled the quiet, but all of it felt wrong now. Lock the doors.
He moved on instinct.
The kitchen door was first. He slid the deadbolt in with a sharp clack and jiggled the handle to check it twice. Next, the front door. The latch clicked into place, and he shoved the metal chain into its slot for good measure. His hands were sweaty, and his heart wouldn‚Äôt stop its frantic thumping. He glanced out the front window as he moved.
Nothing but stillness.
The streetlights buzzed faintly, their glow stretching over the quiet neighborhood. Cars parked along the curb. Driveways empty. A dog barked somewhere in the distance, short and sharp. Where is everybody? Usually, by this time of night, you‚Äôd see porch lights on, people walking their dogs, kids sneaking in late from curfew. But tonight, the world outside looked like a frozen photograph.
He pulled the curtain shut.
Back door. Bolt. Check. Windows. Latches locked. Check. Every window. Every door. He circled the house like a man preparing for a storm, double-checking and triple-checking everything.
By the time he was done, his breathing was heavier, his pulse drumming behind his ears. What was that banging in the background? he thought suddenly. He remembered the sound, dull and hollow, like something battering a door. Was it from the hospital? Were the patients fighting? The image of that wild, jerking figure on the news came back to him, sharp as broken glass. That guy wasn‚Äôt right. The way his arms had flailed. The way his head had snapped forward unnaturally.
Cole rubbed his face, pulling in a breath and letting it out slow. Don‚Äôt spiral. She‚Äôs coming home. She‚Äôs coming home.
The TV news was still droning on in the background, filling the room with the anchor‚Äôs steady, too-calm voice. Cole glanced at it, hoping for some explanation.
‚Äú‚Ä¶reports of violent behavior in several East Coast cities‚Ä¶ officials are advising citizens to stay indoors and avoid large gatherings‚Ä¶‚Äù
The footage shifted to a press conference, a man in a dark suit standing at a podium. His expression was stiff, his words careful. Too careful. Politicians always tried too hard to sound calm when things were not calm.
Cole was halfway to the TV, his eyes narrowing, when everything went black.
The fridge stopped humming. The television screen went dark. The soft glow from the clock on the microwave vanished in an instant.
Silence.
‚Äî like the house itself was holding its breath

¬† Two of my brothers are dead, Sebastian Wroth thought, staring up from the floor as he fought to keep from writhing in pain. Or half-dead.  
  
¬† All he knew was that they'd returned from the battlefront. . . wrong.  
  
¬† Every soldier came back changed by the horrors of war - he himself had - but Sebastian's brothers were altered.  
  
¬† Nikolai, the eldest, and Murdoch, the next eldest, had finally returned home from the Estonian-Russian border. Though Sebastian could hardly believe it, they must have left behind the war that still raged between the two countries.  
  
¬† An angry storm boiled, lashed inland from the nearby Baltic Sea, and out from the torrents of rain, the two strode into Blachmount Manor. Their soaked hats and coats stayed on. The door remained open behind them.  
  
¬† They stood motionless, stunned.  
  
¬† Before them, spread throughout the main hall, was the carnage that used to be their family. Four sisters and their father were dying of plague. Sebastian and their youngest brother Conrad lay battered and stabbed among them. Sebastian was still conscious. Mercifully, the rest weren't, not even Conrad, though he still hissed with pain.  
  
¬† Nikolai had dispatched Sebastian and Conrad home to protect them mere weeks ago. Now all were dying.  
  
¬† The Wroths' ancestral home of Blachmount had proved too tempting a lure to marauding bands of Russian soldiers. Last night, the soldiers had attacked, seeking the rumored riches here as well as the food stores. While defending Blachmount against dozens of them, Sebastian and Conrad had been beaten and then stabbed through the gut - but not killed. Nor had the rest of the family been injured by them. Sebastian and Conrad had held the soldiers off just long enough for them to realize the home was plague-stricken.  
  
¬† The invaders had run, leaving their swords where they'd plunged them. . .  
  
¬† As Nikolai stood over Sebastian, water dripped from his long coat and mingled with Sebastian's congealing blood on the floor. He cast Sebastian a look so raw that for a moment Sebastian thought that he was disgusted with him and Conrad for their failure - as disgusted as Sebastian himself was.  
  
¬† And Nikolai didn't understand the half of it.  
  
¬† Sebastian knew better, though, knew Nikolai would shoulder this burden as he had all others. Sebastian had always been closest to his oldest brother, and he could almost hear Nikolai's thoughts as though they were his own: How could I expect to defend a country, when I could not protect my own flesh and blood?  
  
¬† Sadly, their country of Estonia had fared no better than this family. Russian soldiers had stolen harvests in the spring, then salted and scorched the earth. No grain could be coaxed from the soil, and the countryside starved. Weak and gaunt, the people had easily succumbed when plague broke out.  
  
¬† After recovering from their shock, Nikolai and Murdoch drew away and conferred in harsh whispers, pointing at their sisters and father as they debated something.  
  
¬† They did not seem to be discussing Conrad, unconscious on the floor, or Sebastian himself. Had the younger brothers' fates already been decided?  
  
¬† Even in his delirium, Sebastian understood that somehow the two had been changed - changed into something his fevered mind could scarcely comprehend. Their teeth were different - their canines were longer, and the brothers seemed to bare them in fury and dread. Their eyes were fully black, yet they glowed in the shadowy hall.  
  
¬† As a boy, Sebastian had listened to his grandfather's tales of fanged devils that lived in the nearby marshes.  
  
¬† Vampiir.  
  
¬† They could disappear into thin air and reappear at will, traveling easily that way, and now, through the still-open doorway, Sebastian spied no sweat-slicked horses outside, tethered in haste.  
  
¬† They were baby snatchers and blood drinkers who fed on humans as if they were cattle. Or, worse, they turned humans into their kind.  
  
¬† Sebastian knew his brothers were now among those cursed demons - and he feared they sought to damn their entire family as well.  
  
¬† ""Do not do this thing,"" Sebastian whispered.  
  
¬† Nikolai heard him from too far across the room and strode to him. Kneeling beside him, he asked, ""You know what we are now?""  
  
¬† Sebastian nodded weakly, staring up in disbelief at Nikolai's black irises. Between gasping breaths, he said, ""And I suspect that. . . I know what you contemplate. ""  
  
¬† ""We will turn you and the family as we were turned. ""  
  
¬† ""I will not have this for me,"" Sebastian said. ""I do not want it. ""  
  
¬† ""You must, brother,"" Nikolai murmured. Were his eerie eyes glinting? ""Otherwise you die tonight. ""  
  
¬† ""Good,"" Sebastian rasped. ""Life has long been wearying. And now with the girls dying - ""  
  
¬† ""We will try to turn them as well. ""  
  
¬† ""You will not dare!"" Sebastian roared.  
  
¬† Murdoch cast a look askance at Nikolai, but Nikolai shook his head. ""Lift him up. "" He made his voice like steel, the same tone he had used as a general in the army. ""He will drink. ""  
  
¬† Though Sebastian struggled, spitting curses, Murdoch raised him to a sitting position. A sudden rush of blood pooled from Sebastian's stomach wound. Nikolai flinched at the sight but bit his wrist open.  
  
¬† ""Respect my will in this, Nikolai,"" Sebastian grated, his words desperate. He used his last reserves of strength to clench Nikolai's arm and hold his wrist away. ""Do not force this on us. Living isn't everything. "" They'd often argued this point. Nikolai had always held survival sacred; Sebastian believed that death was better than living in dishonor.  
  
¬† Nikolai was silent, his jet eyes flicking over Sebastian's face as he considered. Then he finally answered, ""I can't. . . I won't watch you die. "" His tone was low and harsh, and he seemed barely able to maintain control of his emotions.  
  
¬† ""You do this for yourself,"" Sebastian said, his voice losing power. ""Not for us. You curse us to salve your conscience. ""  
  
¬† He could not let Nikolai's blood reach his lips. ""No. . . damn you, no!""  
  
¬† But they pried his mouth open, dripped the hot blood inside, and forced his jaw shut until he swallowed it.  
  
¬† They were still holding him down when he took his last breath and his sight went dark.  
  
¬† And none will hear the postman's knock  
  
¬† Without a quickening of the heart.  
  
¬† For who can bear to feel himself forgotten?  
  
¬† \- W. H. Auden  
  
¬† 1  
  
¬† Castle Gornyi, Russia  
  
¬† Present day  
  
¬† F or the second time in her life, Kaderin the Coldhearted hesitated to kill a vampire.  
  
¬† In the last instant of a silent, lethal swing, she stayed her sword an inch above the neck of her prey - because she'd found him holding his head in his hands.  
  
¬† She saw his big body tense. As a vampire, he could easily trace away, disappearing. Instead, he raised his face to gaze at her with dark gray eyes, the color of a storm about to be unleashed. Surprisingly, they were clear of the red that marked a vampire's bloodlust, which meant he had never drunk a being to death. Yet.  
\>  
¬† He beseeched with those eyes, and she realized he hungered for an end. He wanted the death blow she'd come to his decrepit castle to deliver.  
  
¬† She'd stalked him soundlessly, primed for battle with a vicious predator. Kaderin had been in Scotland with other Valkyrie when they'd received the call about a ""vampire haunting a castle and terrorizing a village in Russia. "" She had gladly volunteered to destroy the leech. She was her Valkyrie coven's most prolific killer, her life given over to ridding the earth of vampires.  
  
¬† In Scotland, before this call to Russia, she'd killed three.  
  
¬† So why was she hesitating now? Why was she easing her sword back? He would be merely one among thousands of her kills, his fangs collected and strung together with the others she'd taken.  
  
¬† The last time she'd stayed her hand had resulted in a tragedy so great her heart had been broken forever by it.  
  
¬† In a deep, gravelly voice, the vampire asked, ""Why do you wait?"" He seemed startled by the sound of his own words.  
  
¬† I don't know why. Unfamiliar physical sensations wracked her.

Her stomach knotted. As though a band had tightened around her chest, her lungs were desperate for breath. I can't comprehend why.  
  
¬† The wind blew outside, sliding over the mountain, making this high room in the vampire's darkened lair groan. Unseen gaps in the walls allowed in the chill morning breeze. As he stood, rising to his full, towering height, her blade caught the wavering light from a cluster of candles and reflected it on him.  
  
¬† His grave face was lean with harsh planes, and other females would consider it handsome. His black shirt was threadbare and unbuttoned, displaying much of his chest and sculpted torso, and his worn jeans were slung low at his narrow waist. The wind tugged at the tail of his shirt and stirred his thick black hair. Very handsome. But then, the vampires I kill often are.  
  
¬† His gaze focused on the tip of her sword. Then, as if the threat of her weapon were forgotten, he studied her face, his eyes lingering on each of her features. His blatant appreciation unsettled her, and she clutched the hilt tightly, something she never did.  
  
¬† Honed to masterly sharpness with her diamond file, her sword cut through bone and muscle with little effort. It swung perfectly from her loose wrist as though it were an extension of her arm. She'd never needed to hold it tightly.  
  
¬† Take his head. One less vampire. The species checked in the tiniest way.  
  
¬† ""What is your name?"" His speech was clipped like an aristocrat's, but held a familiar accent. Estonian. Though Estonia bordered Russia to the west and its inhabitants were considered a Nordic breed of Russian, she recognized the difference, and wondered what he was doing away from his own country.  
  
¬† She tilted her head. ""Why do you want to know?""  
  
¬† ""I would like to know the name of the woman who will deliver me from this. ""  
  
¬† He wanted to die. After all she'd suffered from his kind, the last thing she wanted to do was oblige the vampire in any way. ""You assume I'll deliver your death blow?""  
  
¬† ""Will you not?"" His lips curled at the corners, but it was a sad smile.  
  
¬† Another tightening on the sword. She would. Of course, she would. Killing was her only purpose in life. She didn't care if his eyes weren't red. Ultimately, he would drink to kill, and he would turn.  
  
¬† They always did.  
  
¬† He stepped around a stack of hardbound books - some of the hundreds of texts throughout the room with titles imprinted in Russian and, yes, Estonian - and leaned his massive frame against the crumbling wall. He truly wasn't going to raise a hand in defense.  
  
¬† ""Before you do, speak again. Your voice is beautiful. As beautiful as your stunning face. ""  
  
¬† She swallowed, startled to feel her cheeks heating. ""Who do you align with. . . ?"" She trailed off when he closed his eyes as though listening to her were bliss. ""The Forbearers?""  
  
¬† That got him to open his eyes. They were full of anger. ""I align with no one. Especially not them. ""  
  
¬† ""But you were once human, weren't you?"" The Forbearers were an army, or order, of turned humans. They refused to take blood straight from the flesh because they believed that act caused bloodlust. By forbearing, they hoped to avoid becoming like crazed Horde vampires. The Valkyrie remained unoptimistic about their chances.  
  
¬† ""Yes, but I've no interest in that order. And you? You're no human either, are you?""  
  
¬† She ignored his question. ""Why do you linger here in this castle?"" she asked. ""The villagers live in terror of you. ""  
  
¬† ""I won this holding on the battlefield and rightly own it, so I stay. And I've never harmed them. "" He turned away and murmured, ""I wish that I did not frighten them. ""  
  
¬† Kaderin needed to get this killing over with. In just three days, she was to compete in the Talisman's Hie, which was basically a deadly, immortal version of The Amazing Race. Besides hunting vampires, the Hie was the only thing she lived for, and she needed to confirm transportation and secure supplies. And yet she found herself saying, ""They told me you live here alone. ""  
  
¬† He faced her and gave a sharp nod. She sensed that he was embarrassed by this fact, as if he felt lacking that he didn't have a family here.  
  
¬† ""How long?""  
  
¬† He hiked his broad shoulders, pretending nonchalance. ""A few centuries. ""  
  
¬† To live solitary for all that time? ""The people in the valley sent for me,"" she said, as if she had to explain herself. The inhabitants of the remote village belonged to the Lore - a population of immortals and ""mythical"" creatures kept secret from humans. Many of them still worshipped the Valkyrie and provided tributes, but that wasn't what made Kaderin travel to such an isolated place.  
  
¬† The chance to kill even a single vampire had drawn her. ""They pleaded for me to destroy you. ""  
  
¬† ""Then I await your leisure. ""  
  
¬† ""Why not kill yourself, if that's what you want?"" she asked.  
  
¬† ""It's. . . complicated. But you save me from that end. I know you're a skilled warrior - ""  
  
¬† ""How do you know what I am?""  
  
¬† He gave a nod at her sword. ""I used to be a warrior, too, and your remarkable weapon speaks much. ""  
  
¬† The one thing she felt pride in - the one thing in her life that she had left and couldn't bear to lose - and he'd noted its excellence.  
  
¬† He strode closer to her and lowered his voice. ""Strike your blow, creature. Know that no misfortune could come to you for killing one such as me. There is no reason to wait. ""  
  
¬† As if this were a matter of conscience! It wasn't. It couldn't be. She had no conscience. No real feelings, no raw emotions. She was coldhearted. After the tragedy, she'd prayed for oblivion, prayed for the sorrow and guilt to be numbed.  
  
¬† Some mysterious entity had answered her and made her heart like ash. Kaderin didn't suffer from sorrow, from lust, from anger, or from joy. Nothing got in the way of her killing.  
  
¬† She was a perfect killer. She had been for one thousand years, half of her interminable life.  
  
¬† ""Did you hear that?"" he asked. The eyes that had been pleading for an end now narrowed. ""Are you alone?""  
  
¬† She quirked an eyebrow. ""I do not require help from others. Especially not for a single vampire,"" she added, her tone growing absent. Oddly, her attention had dipped to his body once more - to low on his torso, past his navel to the dusky trail of hair leading down. She imagined grazing the back of one of her sharp claws along it while his massive body clenched and shuddered in reaction.  
  
¬† Her thoughts were making her uneasy, making her want to wind her hair up into a knot and let the chill air cool her neck -  
  
¬† He cleared his throat. When she jerked her gaze to his face, he raised his eyebrows.  
  
¬† Caught ogling the prey! The indignity! What is wrong with me? She had no more sexual urges than the walking-dead vampire before her. She shook herself, forcing herself to remember the last time she'd faltered.  
  
¬† On a battlefield, an age ago, she had spared and released another of this ilk, a young vampire soldier who had begged for his life.  
  
¬† Yet he had seemed to scorn her for her very mercy. Without delay, the soldier had found her two full-blood sisters fighting in the flatlands below them. Alerted by a shriek from another Valkyrie, Kaderin had sprinted, stumbling down a hill draped with bodies, living and dead. Just as she'd reached them, he'd cut her sisters down.  
  
¬† The younger, Rika, had been taken off-guard, because of Kaderin's panicked approach. The vampire had smiled when Kaderin dropped to her knees.  
  
¬† He'd dispatched her sisters with a brutal efficiency Kaderin had since emulated. She'd like to say she started with him, but she'd kept him alive for a time.  
  
¬† So, why would she repeat the same mistake? She wouldn't. She would not ignore a lesson she had paid so dearly to learn.  
  
¬† The sooner I get this done, the sooner I can begin preparing for the Hie.  
  
¬† Squaring her shoulders, she steeled herself. It's all in the follow-through. Kaderin could see the swing, knew the angle she would take so that his head would remain on his neck until he fell. It was cleaner that way. Which was important.  
  
¬† She'd packed her suitcase lightly.  
  
¬† 2  
  
  
¬† A s a young man, Sebastian Wroth had desired so many things from life, and having grown up wealthy among a large and supportive family, he had expected them as his due.  
  
¬† He'd wanted his own family, a home, laughter around a hearth. More dearly than all the rest, he'd longed for a wife, a woman to be his alone. He'd been ashamed to admit to this female that he'd managed none of those things.  
  
¬† Now all Sebastian wanted was to gaze at the fascinating creature just a little longer.  
  
¬† At first, he'd thought her an angel come to set him free. She looked it. Her long, curling hair was so blond it appeared almost white in the candlelight. Her eyes were fringed with thick black lashes and were dark like coffee, a striking contrast to her fair hair and wine-red lips. Her skin was flawless, light golden perfection, and her features were delicate and finely wrought.  
  
¬† She was so exquisite, and yet she carried a killer's weapon.

I was bagging him kind of all morning about how long it was taking him to get ready. He sat on the couch and watched YouTube for an hour, then sat on the toilet for another 30-45 mins and then took a 30 min shower. I was annoyed because we planned to take the dog on a walk and get coffee so I was eagerly waiting to go so I can get coffee. As we were leaving the house, I asked if I should order it ahead of time or if we will just order when we get there and he gave me a rude answer so I snapped back and said ‚Äúcan you loose the attitude‚Äù and he immediately came back with ‚Äúcan you stop being a bitch, like for real‚Äù he never ever talks to me like that (been together almost 3 years) so it caught me off guard and I just told him to take the dog on a walk himself and that I don‚Äôt want to be near him. He got all upset, but I don‚Äôt think he realizes what that word means coming from from you s/o. That happened like an hour ago, he took the dog on a walk and brought back coffee but I told him I didn‚Äôt want it anymore because I‚Äôm stubborn and also want to make it known that he was out of pocket, also he never apologized for it.

I would like to start a side business, which is a mobile caf√© set up at events, I am aware of almost everything else (from the business side), but I don't have the machinery yet. I am active in the home barista world, I know most of the specialty grinders and coffee makers there, and I know which brands have their strengths and weaknesses, but not so much in industrial, 100+ coffee per day brewing and grinding machines. I know for a fact that there is a high end side here too, but I don't want to spend 20,000+ Euros right away on a La Marzocco setup. I was thinking of two-armed ones, but the traffic wouldn't necessarily be that intense, so I would also listen to single-armed ones, if you think it makes sense to think of a single-armed one.

The brands I have come across so far: La San Marco, Astoria, Grimac etc.

I will also listen to all the pros, cons, traffic, maintenance, etc. from grinders aswell.

1lmvloi,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1lmvloi/night_thirteen_new_job/,"Night Thirteen, New Job.","I don't normally converse with you on this kind of level. Yes this is a new chapter to the story, and it will be as followed. Though I must tell you some of the things that happened tonight are kind of concerning, including the ending of tonight. I must say the park given to me was much more than I expected, but I have to wonder what am I trading for this money. All right, let's get to it:

---

Night Thirteen:

I‚Äôm starting to think this place wants me to fail.

Last night, Lila saved me by reminding me about Rule Six. This place is alive, watching, testing. And I‚Äôm just barely keeping up.

Tonight, I decided to test the rules. Not because I wanted to screw things up, but because maybe if I understand the rules better, I might actually get ahead of whatever this place is.

I needed to see if I could trust Lila ‚Äî and the rules she seems to protect.

Around 3 AM, the Slurpee machine started humming. Not the usual buzz, but a low, dark rumble ‚Äî like it was thinking about dispensing that god-awful red slurp.

I pulled the red bucket out from under the sink, just like the rules say. But instead of letting it cycle normally, I stopped the machine after one bucket.

Almost instantly, the lights flickered and the temperature dropped.

Then I heard footsteps ‚Äî slow, deliberate, from the front door.

I checked the cameras, but there was no one there.

And then the black phone rang.

It was a voice I didn‚Äôt recognize. It didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúRed Slurpee.‚Äù

It said: ‚ÄúYou broke the cycle.‚Äù

I almost dropped the receiver.

I don‚Äôt know what happens if you break the rules on purpose. I don‚Äôt want to find out.

Then I heard a quiet voice behind me.

‚ÄúYou should have let it finish.‚Äù

I turned, and there was Lila ‚Äî standing close enough I could see the faint shimmer around her.

‚ÄúThe rules aren‚Äôt just warnings,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre promises. Breaking them wakes things.‚Äù

I swallowed hard.

‚ÄúWhat kind of things?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThe kind that don‚Äôt sleep.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not sure what that means.

But I know one thing ‚Äî I‚Äôm not ready for whatever‚Äôs coming.

‚Äî Mason

---

The sun came up like a half-hearted apology, pale and late. The fluorescent lights didn‚Äôt even flicker out‚Äîthey just buzzed louder, as if the store itself didn‚Äôt want to let go of the night.

I was dead on my feet. Eyes burning. Brain fried from near-death Slurpee incidents, ghost warnings, and the kind of existential dread that clings to the inside of your lungs.

So when the manager came in, all fresh coffee and nervous glances, I decided to ask.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, trying to sound casual, ‚Äúcan I ask you something about the rules?‚Äù

He froze.

Not subtly. Not like someone pretending they didn‚Äôt hear. He went still, like a deer hearing the crack of a twig right before it bolts.

‚ÄúWhat about them?‚Äù he asked, voice low.

‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs actually going on here? The Slurpee thing. Lila. The CDC guy. You gave me a list, but no explanations. I think I deserve at least‚Äî‚Äù

He held up a hand. Shaking slightly.

‚ÄúStop. Just stop.‚Äù
He looked around the store like it might be listening.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt handle that. I don‚Äôt work nights. I don‚Äôt come in after 10 PM, and I don‚Äôt want to know what happens here after dark.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the manager.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf the day shift,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúAs far as I‚Äôm concerned, this place closes at ten and reopens at six. Whatever happens in between‚Ä¶‚Äù

He trailed off. His eyes weren‚Äôt on me anymore. They were fixed on something behind me. Something that wasn‚Äôt there.

‚ÄúYou think I want to be part of that?‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúHell no. That‚Äôs what you were hired for. Not customer service. Not stocking shelves. You were hired to follow the rules.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why me?‚Äù

He reached into his bag and pulled out a plain white envelope. Handed it to me like it was radioactive.

‚ÄúThis is a raise. Decent one, too. More than I‚Äôm making.‚Äù

I stared at it, then at him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to pay me not to quit.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm begging you not to quit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had‚Ä¶ others. They didn‚Äôt make it past a few nights. The ones who did?‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where they are now. I don‚Äôt ask.‚Äù

I looked down at the envelope. It felt heavier than paper.

‚ÄúWhat happens if I stop showing up?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt answer. Just walked to the stockroom like we‚Äôd never spoken.

The buzzer on the back door chirped once.
The shift had changed.

But I hadn‚Äôt.

I just stood there, holding the envelope, wondering what the hell I‚Äôd gotten myself into.

And why he was so sure it had to be me.

¬† When I arrived at the party, it was the largest I had ever seen. The mansion was filled with people. The doors had been left open and the overflow spilled out to the front lawn. The driveway went around a large fountain, which a few girls had gotten into. Their shirts were soaked to their skin and their hair was messily rumpled, giving them the wet sexy look. I knew the guys, who stood with their drinks at the side, enjoyed the view. More than a few had that dark promise in their eyes. They wanted sex and they wanted it now. One of the girls squealed as a guy swept her in the air.

¬† I smirked. He was dressed appropriately with custom-tailored jeans and a loose-flowing shirt that was left unbuttoned. A white tank was underneath. It fitted like a second skin to his abdominal muscles and chest. I saw that he had been working out more, but whatever. What did I care? He had dropped our friendship two months ago, and since Adam was the Golden Boy for our school, Fallen Crest Academy, everybody else had followed suit. No one talked to me anymore, even his neighbor, the one person I had come to consider as a real friend.  
  
¬† I asked, though maybe I shouldn't have, ""How's Becky?""  
  
¬† He flinched.  
  
¬† A small sense of triumph flared through me, but it was so small, and it was gone instantly.  
  
¬† ""Uh,"" he looked away before his jaw hardened, and he met my gaze again. This time he didn't blink. ""She's good. I think she's dating someone from your school.""  
  
¬† ""My school?""  
  
¬† ""FCP. You know what I mean. Their school, you're one of them now, so‚Ä¶your school.""  
  
¬† ""I still go to Fallen Crest Academy.""  
  
¬† He clenched his jaw. ""I heard something else.""  
  
¬† All senses went on alert. I knew what he was talking about, but I hadn't known it was already on the gossip mill. This wasn't good. ""What'd you hear?""  
  
¬† He shrugged and looked away. There it was. I knew it was only a matter of time. Adam could never be honest with me for too long.  
  
¬† ""What'd you hear?""  
  
¬† ""Come on, Sam.""  
  
¬† ""Come on, what?"" I knew he was going to leave. I sensed it and grabbed his arm as he started to inch away. ""What did you hear?""  
  
¬† ""Let go of me."" His eyes hardened as he looked over my shoulder. ""I don't think I'm supposed to be talking to you.""  
  
¬† ""What are you talking about‚Ä¶"" But the words left me as an arm snaked around my waist and pulled me back against a hard chest, a very hard chest.  
  
¬† Mason's chin came to rest on my shoulder and he breathed out. The air caressed my neck, and I felt the possession in his demeanor. A tingle raced through me, especially when his hand slid down my waist to rest on my hip. He pressed me back against him again. I felt every inch of him now and fought against closing my eyes when my desire started to overtake me.  
  
¬† ""I should be going,"" Adam mumbled before he turned. But then he stopped. His face was twisted in an unnamed emotion. ""Thanks for inviting everyone to the party.""  
  
¬† ""Not my party."" Mason straightened against my back. His hands held me firmly in place, but I could feel the coldness from him now.  
  
¬† Adam didn't squirm; he straightened and never looked away. He had learned. Then his eyes caught mine for a second before he looked away again. A shiver went over me. I saw his anger in that second, but he only replied, ""Your best friend's place. Your party.""  
  
¬† ""This is Nate's party?"" I twisted around, but Mason didn't let go of me. His hands had a firm grasp on my hips. When he didn't look down, his gaze still fixed over my shoulder, I slid a hand around his neck and tilted him downwards. He met my gaze then and I tried to stop myself from melting. His green eyes softened and a small grin came over him. When he lifted a hand to rub against the top of my lip, I closed my eyes. A groan escaped me before I realized what I was doing. Then I grabbed his hand. ""Stop.""  
  
¬† ""Stop what?"" His amusement was evident.  
  
¬† ""This is Nate's party?"" That meant one thing. This was his place, but did that mean‚Ä¶""Is Nate moving back?""  
  
¬† And then someone threw his arms around us and we were pulled in for an even tighter hug. ""Hello, my peeps!"" Logan's breath smelled of booze and as he hugged us again. ""I love you guys and you know what else I love?""  
  
¬† Mason grimaced, but I still caught the small grin at the corners of his lips. He deadpanned, ""Nate's pussy?""  
  
¬† Logan threw his head back and let loose a hoot. Then, even as he died down, he couldn't wipe the silly grin off his face. And he wasn't trying, not even the slightest. ""Yeah, maybe."" His eyes turned to me and I was caught by the intensity in them. An abnormal look of earnestness was in them, albeit slightly blurred from booze, but it was there. It was the most sincere expression Logan had allowed me to see in a long while. He reminded me of a five-year-old little boy in that moment, one with shaggy brown curls and dark chocolate eyes that made so many girls' heart melt. ""Did Mason tell you? Nate's moving back for the last half of the year. How fucking fantastic is that?""  
  
¬† Very. Nate was the fourth member in our group, but it hurt. He hadn't said a word, but Mason couldn't stop from grinning at Logan so I forced myself to put it away. Nate was back. That was all that mattered, and then realization hit me as I looked around. This enormous place was his.  
  
¬† ""This is Nate's place?""  
  
¬† Yet, even as I asked, I knew it was. Both of them didn't answer, silent as I looked around again. There were so many people at the party. I recognized a few from my school, obviously with Adam there, and I knew there were students from Fallen Crest Public as well. I saw a few of Mason and Logan's friends and figured more from their school was there as well, but two schools couldn't have been everyone? Who else was there?  
  
¬† ""Dude, tell her.""  
  
¬† Mason admitted with a smirk, ""Nate's got some high placed friends.""  
  
¬† Just then a well-known actor strolled past us with his arm around two girls.  
  
¬† My mouth dropped open. I couldn't believe it, but I should've. Nate's parents were movie directors. When he wasn't getting in trouble with Mason and Logan, they tried to keep him with them as often as possible. Of course he would've met more than a few from the Hollywood scene. But, still, I couldn't believe it.  
  
¬† I grasped Mason's hand and squeezed tight. ""My mom has a huge crush on him.""  
  
¬† He wrenched his hand away as he stepped back. Logan held up both arms. ""Hey, whoa. Too much information, girly.""  
  
¬† ""What?""  
  
¬† Mason grimaced. ""We don't want to know who your mom jerks off to.""  
  
¬† ""What?"" Oh my word. They thought‚ÄîI sputtered out, ""No, I didn't mean, I mean, NO!""  
  
¬† Then both started to laugh. Soon their shoulders shook as more laughter slipped from their clasped lips.  
  
¬† A wave of embarrassment came over me. I was pissed and mortified. When I lifted a hand to slap Mason's arm, he caught it instead and twirled me so I was in his arms again. My back was to his chest and his arms came around in front of me. He turned so we faced  
Logan before his hands slid down to hold my hips still as he started to rub against me.  
  
¬† Logan cringed. ""Oh please, guys. I live with you.""  
  
¬† Mason bent forward so his lips were next to my ear. I felt them curve into a grin. His breath tickled my skin. ""Feel free to go away now, brother.""  
  
¬† ""Correction."" Logan flashed us a dark look. ""I have to live with you. I need to rectify that soon."" Then he saluted us both with two fingers in the air as he turned and walked away. He hadn't gone more than a few steps before his stroll turned into a saunter. His hands slid into his front pockets, his shoulders leaned forward a bit, and a different vibe came over him. It wasn't a surprise when a group of girls clambered over to him. With his shoulders hunched forward, it gave him a vulnerable appeal that was almost irresistible to girls when it was mixed with an already dangerous reputation.  
  
¬† Mason chuckled against my ear. Then he caught it with his teeth and bit down gently.  
  
¬† Tingles raced through me and I lifted to my toes as his teeth scraped against the bottom of my earlobe. He drew it out, gently and lovingly. Sensually. A burst of heat flared between my legs. The same throb started deep. As his hips moved forward, I felt him behind me and closed my eyes from the pleasure. The throbbing was almost too much now. The same desire I always felt for him started to take over. I felt my control slipping.  
  
¬† ""Mason,"" I gasped as I arched my back against him. My arm lifted to behind his neck. When I held him in place, his lips started to nibble downwards and I was barely conscious of being turned in his arms. My breasts were pushed against his chest and he lifted one of my legs so he could fit further between them. I arched against him. I gasped for breath, but his mouth covered mine instantly.  
  
¬† He took control.  
  
¬† He commanded his entrance, and I was helpless against him. His tongue slipped inside my mouth. Mine brushed against his. A growl emanated from him. It sent a rush of power through me that was intoxicating. I wanted more and my tongue met his again, this time to brush slowly against his. Then I pulled away, but not before I flicked the tip of my tongue against his top lip. As my eyelids lifted, heavy and saturated from lust, I saw the answering yearning in his. Then his eyes flashed in determination, and I knew it wouldn't be long before Mason would be in me, deep and hard.  
  
¬† An elated shiver ran through me. I wanted nothing more than that.  
  
¬† ""I know the two of you are horny rabbits and in love and all that, but I don't think you want to make an amateur sex tape right here.""  
  
¬† We broke apart, panting, and took in the grinning sight of Nate's face. He gestured to where a group had congregated. I saw more than a few cameras in the air with fingers to the record buttons.  
  
¬† ""Hi, Nate,"" I croaked out. A heated rush of embarrassment flooded me. I couldn't believe I had almost lost control or that Mason had as well. He set the tone most of the times. I trusted him, but a tingle of addictive power went through me as I remembered the sound of his own groan. I held him as captivated as he held me.  
  
¬† Mason cursed under his breath but swept us around so his back was to the group and I was shielded from the audience.  
  
¬† ""Hi, Sam.""  
  
¬† I flinched at how cheery Nate sounded. Mason's hand swept down before he held my face to his shoulder. I felt his tension as his voice reverberated through his chest. ""Thanks, man.""  
  
¬† ""Any time."" His tone was amused. Then I felt Nate's lips on my forehead. He whispered before he darted off, ""It's good to see you too, Sam. Take care of my boy.""  
  
¬† Mason groaned as he brushed my hair from my face and looked down into my eyes. I tilted backwards and saw the warmth in his gaze. My heart skipped a beat. I couldn't believe it. We'd been official for two months, but it never got old. He never got old. He never tired of me. I wasn't sure what I would do if that happened, if any of those nightmares occurred.  
  
¬† All I knew, as Mason continued to hold me to his chest, was that I couldn't lose him. Who the hell was I trying to kid? I couldn't lose any of them, Mason, Logan, or even Nate. They were the only friends I had in my life now.  
  
¬† I felt panic start to rise, but I forced it down. I had to. I couldn't lose it, not in his arms. Never in his arms.  
  
¬† CHAPTER TWO  
  
¬† The rest of the night had been free of drama, and I was relieved. Mason stuck close to me as he always did when I would attend parties, but I knew there were a ton of his friends who wanted his attention. For the most part, the friends from their school stuck close to each other. I wasn't part of that group. Even though I was dating Mason, they still considered me as an Academite, their term for the snotty rich kids. That was fine. I was far from the normal economic status of my classmates, but I knew that wasn't the real reason I hadn't been welcomed into the group. Mason and Logan's father was one of the wealthiest men in town, but they were accepted into any circle.  
  
¬† I wasn't stupid.  
  
¬† The girls didn't like me because I got Mason, who had been deemed unavailable except for the few times he chose someone for sex. Now he has a girlfriend, and they're pissed. The girls in their tight circle cursed at me, insulted me, even pushed me against a wall a few times, but it was always done when Mason or Logan weren't around. As for the guys, a few of them would glare at me while the others stayed away. Nate told me during one of his visits that some of the guys worried if I would change Mason.  
  
¬† I made a point not to.  
  
¬† I never argued when Mason said he was going to a party. After the third time of getting tripped or elbowed by the girls, I stopped going with him. He'd been confused, but I shrugged when he questioned me about it. I told him that I'd rather go for a long run and he dropped the conversation. It hadn't even been a lie. I loved running, and I had never enjoyed parties. I had gone before because my two best friends and boyfriend wanted me to go. But they weren't my friends anymore. I had no friends at my own school; no one would invite me to the parties, even the ones that weren't Public Parties, the name coined for those thrown by anyone who went to Fallen Crest Public School. They were the best ones.  
  
¬† And Nate's party exceeded everyone's expectations.  
  
¬† When I had stood in line for the bathroom, a girl said she saw people from four different schools. I hadn't been surprised. Mason and Logan ruled their school. Those at Fallen Crest Academy clamored for their attention as well, and with Nate's contribution, I was surprised more schools hadn't shown up. Even after Nate had been forced to move away after getting into too much trouble with Mason, he came back for visits often enough to feel as if he lived there. He came back for his and Mason's last semester in high school. They would end it together, and then they would start again. Mason didn't talk about college much, but I knew that he had already committed to a university where he would play football for them. Nate was going as well. They were going to be roommates, and if anyone were to ask my opinion, I had a feeling that Logan felt out of the loop. He and I had one more year in high school, but this was the point in my thoughts when I stopped thinking.  
  
¬† I didn't like to think of that time when Mason would go away. Hell, I didn't even like to think of my dilemma for next semester.  
  
¬† ""You're thinking,"" Mason mumbled next to me as he rolled over and wrapped his arms around me. He reached over my waist and tugged me back against him. One of his legs shifted over mine, and I was securely enveloped by him.  
  
¬† I grinned when the tingle started. It didn't take much anymore, just a touch and the memory of what was to come rushed through me. When I turned to face him, his eyes were sparkling down at me. A small grin curved up and his green eyes searched mine. They darkened with lust when I lifted a hand to cup the side of his cheek. I licked my lips as my throat went dry and moved even closer to him.  
  
¬† I couldn't get enough of him.  
  
¬† ""Sam,"" he murmured.  
  
¬† ""Hmmm?"" I started to explore his chest. My hand slipped down and rounded his slender waist. I rubbed over his muscles‚Äîthey were structured and photo-shopped to perfection. When one of my fingers slipped underneath his boxer's waistband, he sucked in his breath. I grinned from the anticipation and addiction I had to  
him. I loved touching him. I loved making him groan in pleasure, and, as I pushed him to his back and settled over him, I loved looking down and seeing him helpless to my touch. It made two of us.  
  
¬† ""Fuck, woman,"" he growled in a husky voice. His hands settled on my thighs as I straddled him. His fingers dug in when I dipped down and licked his neck. Then I moved farther down, and his hands dug in even farther. He had a cement hold on me when I teased the edge of his boxers, but then his phone went off and we both froze.  
  
¬† It rang again.  
  
¬† Our eyes met because we both knew who that was. We had discussed it the night before when I made the decision to turn my phone off. Since the party was at Nate's home, or his parent's home as Mason explained, he wanted to stay the night. It was an easy decision. The Kade mansion, where my mother had started to boycott any nights Mason slept in my bed, or his best friend's place? There'd been no need for a discussion. We did, however, have to discuss what we were going to do when my mother would start calling. I wasn't a fan of turning off my phone. Not many called or texted, but there'd been times when Mason or Logan had been hurt. I missed a phone call one time after Mason had been in a bad fight. I vowed never to experience that panic again. However, Mason promised that if I turned my phone off, he would deal with my mother and his father in the morning.  
  
¬† The phone rang for the third time.  
  
¬† He growled and cursed at the same time as he rolled out from underneath me. He picked his phone up in one swift movement as he stood from the bed and went into the bathroom. ""What?""  
  
¬† The shower turned on, and when I crossed to the doorway, he had put the phone on the counter and was ignoring it as he stepped underneath the spray. When he shut the water off, his father's voice was still going strong over the phone. He sounded furious, but I knew it was more from my mother. Analise was like a starving dog going after a bone when she got something in her head. And she had decided that I would not be fornicating with my stepbrother.  
  
¬† That didn't go over well with Mason, who told them both to fuck off. More fights ensued, raised voices, threats, even blackmail had been mentioned once. None of it fazed Mason. He withstood all of it and I started running longer and longer each day. Then one day, after I returned from a five hour run, my mother surprised us both as she told me that we could see each other, but we were not to sleep together. Ever.  
  
¬† That rule wasn't followed, but she was still trying to enforce it. God bless her determination.  
  
¬† ""‚Ä¶and you will tell Samantha to return her mother's phone call. Analise is beside herself. We had to go to the hospital for her to calm down. She couldn't sleep last night.""  
  
¬† Mason rolled his eyes after he finished drying himself off with a towel. He stepped close, pressed a kiss to my forehead, and shooed me into the shower. With a quick wink and a slap on my ass, he strolled back to the room with his phone in hand.  
  
¬† When I was done showering, the bedroom was empty so I dressed and headed for the kitchen. Our room was in a small hallway, but I stepped out onto the second level that was in a circle. There were more bedrooms on the side as I passed them towards the stairs at the end of the circle. The entire house was set up in a large circle, with the fountain centered below. As I went down the stairs, the water was flowing freely, but I heard noises from a back corner so I veered to the left. I went through a living room and cut across the top corner to the kitchen.  
  
¬† A large group had congregated around the counters and the island in the middle. Nate was at the stove. One of their female friends was plastered against his side. She wore a skimpy piece of white cloth that barely covered her breasts, sans bra, and ripped jean shorts that hardly covered her cheeks. As she gazed up at Nate, seduction written all over her face, I couldn't stop the gag from my mouth.  
  
¬† The sound echoed over the room, and all conversation stopped.  
  
¬† I didn't see Mason or Logan. It was the group of friends who barely held back their loathing. One of the guys straightened from the counter, beer in hand, and glared at me. ""You got a problem?""  
  
¬† Nate was in front of him within seconds. ""Ethan, man, don't start this.""  
  
¬† ""Start what? Did you hear her?""  
  
¬† ""Yeah."" Nate's seductress positioned her hand to her hip. She struck a defiant pose. ""Did you hear her? It was rude, Nate. It was directed at me. She thinks I'm a joke.""  
  
¬† ""And you haven't been rude to her?""  
  
¬† A shiver went down my back as I remembered the look in Nate's eyes when I first approached. He'd been easygoing, laidback. Then he went to a neutral stance, but now his eyes glittered with rage. An aura of authority emanated from him. The girl stepped back and everyone fell silent. It was my first glimpse of this side of Mason's best friend. If I had ever doubted their bond before, I didn't anymore. Change the body, the looks, and he could've been Mason. They held the same authority. Nate was just showing his in front of me for the first time.  
  
¬† His lip curved up in an ugly sneer as he stepped closer to Ethan, who had straightened from the counter. The beer spilled as his hand jerked around it, squashing the can in a crinkled ball of metal.  
  
¬† Nate's voice was cold, eerily cold. ""You've all been rude to her, and they don't know a thing."" He waited a beat as his gaze swept the group. ""Why don't you ponder on that, huh? You think they'd stand for your attitude towards her?"" Then he whipped his gaze back to Ethan, whose jaw clenched from the scrutiny. ""You want your ass kicked? Keep being a bitch to her."" He stopped abruptly. His chest heaved up and down before he bit out, ""She hasn't said a word. Ponder that too, you asswipes.""  
  
¬† ""Baby,"" the girl whimpered. She held a hand out.  
  
¬† Nate ignored her and brushed past me. His jaw was still clenching and before he disappeared around a corner, his hand turned into a fist. But then he was gone, and I was left alone with a group that hated me.  
  
¬† All of them turned their hostile gazes to me.  
  
¬† I gulped. Oh my.  
  
¬† I held my breath, waiting. Did I attack? Hell no. But should I wait to be attacked? I knew they would and then heard a whispered snarl, ""You bitch!""  
  
¬† There it was.  
  
¬† It was Nate's seductress. She stood in front of me, brazen with nearly nothing on, and tossed her long brown hair over her shoulder. Something shifted in me. I had come to remember a few of their names. Kate was the ring leader. I was pretty certain she had a 'benefits' relationship with Mason before he went steady with me, and this girl was her best friend forever‚Ä¶Parker, if I remembered correctly?  
  
¬† I opened my mouth, ready for some retort. I wasn't sure what I was about to say, but it was coming. I only hoped it made sense, or that it didn't get me in more trouble. I'd grown tired of the female catty showdowns, and this was certainly one of them.  
  
¬† But then Ethan flung his beer can into the sink and grunted. ""Leave her alone, Parks.""  
  
¬† Her mouth fell open on a gasp and she rounded to him. Her boobs flopped side to side from the motion. ""Are you kidding me?!""  
  
¬† He sighed as he ran a hand over his tired face. ""Come on. Nate's right, man. Leave her alone. Kade likes her, leave her be. She ain't going anywhere, and I'm getting tired of this. I don't want to get my ass handed to me by them, and you know it's gonna happen. You're going to say something in front of them and everything will go to hell for us.""  
  
¬† ""But‚Äî""  
  
¬† He stepped away from the counter as he crossed his arms over his chest. The sleeveless, ripped shirt exposed the biceps that now bulged from the motion. His chest grew in size as well. ""It ain't happening, not on my watch. Get going. Go tell all the little girlies. I know they'll have a hay day with this one.""  
  
¬† Her mouth hung open, no sound came from it. Then one of the guys let loose a snicker and she exploded, ""Shut the hell up, Strauss! This ain't got a goddamn thing to do with you.""  
  
¬† His snicker doubled in volume. A slap to his thigh was heard as he chuckled, ""Its sure fun to watch you getting your rear end handed to you.""  
  
¬† If she could've killed me, she would've in that moment. The blood drained from her face, and she crossed her arms over her chest. Her lips were stiff as she promised, ""I will make you pay for this. The guys might be okay with you, but the girls won't be and we're no picnic, honey. You better watch out from now on.""  
  
¬† As she stormed away, I knew her shoulder was going to slam into mine. With gritted teeth, I reacted before I thought about the consequences and I shoulder-checked her instead. She bounced back into a counter, and gasped again. The loathing had always been there, but now white-hot hatred came at me. A low growl emitted from her throat before she rushed from the room.  
  
¬† Again, there was silence in the room.  
  
¬† My heart dropped to my gut as I waited for the next showdown. There were a handful of girls spread out among the other guys.  
  
¬† I wasn't stupid. I had learned that Mason and Logan's friends from Fallen Crest Public were the rough and tumble sort of kids. They weren't from money. They didn't give a damn about whose daddy paid for their trip overseas or the secret trysts of which daddy was with which mommy, or even who was cheating with whose secretary. These were the kids that partied hard, played harder, and turned into a single unit against an outsider. They were tight-knit. They were closed-mouthed. And they weren't stupid, even though I knew those from my school would mislabel them as that. They were far from stupid and I knew something pivotal had just happened.  
  
¬† Ethan, the fourth in command after Mason, Logan, and Nate, had turned against one of the girls. I also knew that meant there would be a divide. The girls w  
ould hate me, while the guys were now okay. And judging by the relieved shoulders and carefree laughter in the room, the guys might've been hoping for this for awhile. Then again, who would willingly want to go against Mason and Logan?  
  
¬† But I still had a fight on my hands. The girls were going to be the toughest, and since they had divorced from the guys' support, I figured they would be worse than normal. This was going to be hell.  
  
¬† Kate was the leader. Parker was her sidekick, but there was another twosome that made up the core group of their four. Natalie and Jasmine. They weren't in the kitchen that morning, but I knew they were somewhere. They were going to be coming for me, somehow, someplace.  
  
¬† Ethan went to the refrigerator and grabbed another beer. As he leaned against a counter, crossed one faded jean-clad leg over the other, and folded his arms across his chest again, he smirked at me. ""You need to learn how to kick some ass because you're going to need it. Those girls don't care two hoots if Mason and Logan don't like it. Those girls are vicious. They stick together like a pack of jacked-up wolves. You best get some bite to you.""  
  
¬† Oh great. I didn't think running long distances was going to help me with that, but I couldn't be surprised. I had known this would come. This was a group that you had to fight your way in to prove you deserved your spot amongst them.  
  
¬† There was a reason why Mason and Logan were friends with them.  
  
¬† CHAPTER THREE  
  
¬† Mason wasn't in our room when I went back, so I went in search for him. As I was going past some stairs that led to the basement, or one of the basement areas, a whistle stopped me.  
  
¬† ""Sam, what's going on?""  
  
¬† Logan came up with no shirt and his jeans unbuttoned. His hair was messily rumpled, as if he'd just woken up or just had sex. With him, I never knew. And then I got my answer.  
  
¬† My eyes went wide. Jessica was behind him. Her shirt was twisted to the side and she was zipping up her own jeans when she saw me. A thick bunch of her hair slipped over her face and covered her eyes, but she brushed it back before she stopped behind Logan.  
  
¬† A smug smirk came over her as she leaned against the wall. ""Hiya, Sam. How's it going?""  
  
¬† I rounded on Logan. ""Are you kidding me?""  
  
¬† Regret flashed over his face, but then he reached for my hand. ""You okay? You seem upset.""  
  
¬† ""You screwed her?""  
  
¬† ""You seemed upset before you saw us. What's going on?""  
  
¬† ""Oh."" I bit my lip. He didn't want to talk about Jessica, I got the message. I hated it. I hated the idea of him and her together. It was one of my worst nightmares. ""If you date her, I'm gone.""  
  
¬† His eyes widened a fraction, but that was the only reaction I got from him. A cocky glimmer came over him and he rolled his shoulders back. ""Oh, come on, Sam. It's not like that. I promise.""  
  
¬† ""Jerk,"" Jessica hissed.  
  
¬† ""But something else is going on. What is it?""  
  
¬† ""Logan."" I pressed my hands against my forehead. A headache was coming on. I already knew that I couldn't stop it. It'd be full blown within an hour and I'd be on the bathroom floor very soon. ""I can't deal with this right now. Do you know where Mason is?""  
  
¬† A snort came from the sideline.  
  
¬† I whirled on her. ""Do not make one more sound. This morning hasn't been the greatest, and I'd love to take it out on you. I really would.""  
  
¬† Her haughty eyes met mine, but there was no retort. I was shocked. Jessica wasn't one to not have a hateful comment ready on the tip of her tongue. That was who she was, spiteful and mean. But then I realized she was keeping quiet because of Logan. I wanted to throw my hands in the air and pull my hair out. She was back to him. I couldn't believe it. I didn't know what she had said to him or done to him to do whatever they did together, but I knew it was sneaky. Then I remembered something else.  
  
¬† ""Aren't you dating Jeff?""  
  
¬† She shrugged. ""Yeah, but it's not like we're based on good relationship morals. You should know that more than anyone."" A smug look came over her.  
  
¬† I wanted that look gone, and I reacted before I thought about it. I raised my hand and slapped her.  
  
¬† She gasped. When her face snapped back to mine, the old Jessica was back in place. The hatred I always saw from her was there. She sucked in her breath. Her chest rose up and down in dramatic breaths, and I knew she was trying to keep herself under control.  
  
¬† I said, heated, ""You were my best friend for years. I dated Jeff for three years. If you think I was more hurt because you screwed my boyfriend for two years, then you really are a shallow person. I lost a friend, you idiot. I lost both of my best friends at the same time.""  
  
¬† A different look came to her then. Her hand fell from her cheek slowly.  
  
¬† ""Hey. Okay."" Logan stepped between us. His hand touched my elbow, and he urged me up the stairs. ""What's going on? What happened this morning?""  
  
¬† I let him lead me down a hallway and away from her. When I glanced back, Jessica slipped further down the hallway. I hoped she was leaving. I couldn't handle her being there, not in my world. I wouldn't let her destroy my life again.  
  
¬† ""Hey.""  
  
¬† I snapped back to him. I was still shaking from the anger inside of me. ""Did you sleep with her?""  
  
¬† He grimaced again and ran a hand through his hair. As he rubbed at his jaw, he let loose a deep breath. ""Man, I wasn't thinking that through last night.""  
  
¬† ""So you did.""  
  
¬† It stung, it stung a lot.  
  
¬† ""Yeah,"" he whispered. ""I am sorry, Sam. I didn't think about you. That seemed so long ago, and I was drunk. I was alone. I was on the couch downstairs, and she was there. She was whispering all these great promises to me. Her hands were all over me. I liked her touch last night. I liked it a lot. That girl is good in bed, but damn, I should've thought more clearly. I really am sorry.""  
  
¬† ""She took my friends away."" It hurt to admit that, but it was the truth. Jeff hadn't been a stand-up guy, but I was certain that she had seduced him. And she had gotten Lydia to cover for them. She took them both away. When it had come out, she tried to turn more against me. Whatever I had done to her, it must've been horrible, but I had no idea. That was the worst part of it. I had no idea why someone who I had loved since we were kids hated me so much. Had we ever really been friends?  
  
¬† A strong arm wrapped around my shoulders, and I was pulled against Logan's hard chest. He dipped his head and pressed a kiss to my forehead. ""I'm really sorry, Sam. But I promise last night was the one and only time. I won't have anything to do with her again. I'm sorry.""  
  
¬† I nodded. It took some of the pain away, but until Jessica had sprung up in my life again, I had no idea how much I'd been hurt by her. The door was open now, and more pain came through. Then I blocked it. I repressed it all back down again, and tuned into what Logan was saying, ""‚Ä¶pool house maybe.""  
  
¬† ""Huh?""  
  
¬† ""If you're looking for Mason, he's probably in the pool house. It's where he and Nate hang out. They think no one knows about it, but we all do. It's their alone time together."" He winked at me as he squeezed me close for one more hug. ""You okay?""  
  
¬† I nodded. ""Yeah, I'll be fine. She brings bad memories. That's all.""  
  
¬† ""Okay."" Then he yawned and ran a hand over his face again. ""I've got to wake up. Man. You eat yet?""  
  
¬† ""I was in there, yeah.""  
  
¬† ""Okay, go check the pool house. I'm sure he's in there. I'm going to get some grub."" He pressed one more kiss to my forehead before he let me go. As he left, I watched him saunter away. I rolled my eyes. I didn't think Logan knew how to walk without a cocky strut.  
  
¬† When I slipped out through one of the patio doors, there were more people in the pool. A group had congregated at some of the tables near it. I didn't recognize any of them so I continued to the pool house. When I stepped inside, Mason was at the bar. He sat on a stool with a cup of coffee in front of him. It looked like it hadn't been touched, but the steam still rose in the air. He was hunched over with his phone stuck to his ear.  
  
¬† ""Hey.""  
  
¬† I jumped and whirled around. Nate sat on a couch with a grin from ear to ear. His shoulders shook in amusement, b  
ut he gestured towards Mason. ""He's been on the phone the whole time.""  
  
¬† ""He was talking to his dad."" I glanced over, but he hadn't looked up or acknowledged me. Then I heard his next words, ""Fuck off, dad. I mean it!"" The hostility in them blasted me. I jumped in reaction but was dumbfounded when I heard Nate's soft laughter. I whirled back around. ""You think that's funny?""  
  
¬† ""Yeah."" The laughter died away, but a small grin was still in place. He lounged back on the couch and threw one arm to rest on the top. ""When Mason gets pissed, it's never good for the other person. And since it's his dad, I'm excited for what we're going to be doing.""  
  
¬† ""If that's what you want, fine."" Mason's loud exclamation was followed with a curse as he dropped his phone on the bar. He shoved back from the stool but stopped when he saw me. All the rage drained from him, and he sighed before his head slowly hung down. ""I'm sorry, Sam. I am.""  
  
¬† ""What are you talking about?"" My throat was suddenly so dry. It was painful for me to speak. ""What did your dad say?""  
  
¬† ""Your mom's being a bitch.¬†

I walked over to my sink and grabbed the rubber gloves I wear while doing the dishes. After putting them on, I quickly grabbed a trash bag and returned to the fridge.¬†



I stared at the fridge door for a good long time. The only sound in my apartment was Sonny happily eating his food, completely oblivious to the horrible thing that his owner was going through. I really do envy him. Finally, after taking a deep breath and holding it in, I flung the fridge door open and quickly grabbed the lungs. A loud gag escaped from my throat as my hands made contact with the lungs. They were soft and spongy and felt like if I squeezed them too hard, they would burst like a disgusting, bloody balloon. I quickly shoved them into the trash bag and closed it as tightly as I possibly could. I then ran over to the sink and threw up again, quickly washing my gloves clean and leaving them out to dry.¬†



I left the bag in the kitchen, but had to move it up to the sink to stop Sonny from trying to rip open the bag and take a nibble out of the lungs. I wanted nothing more than to go back to the clinic and shove the lungs back into Dr. Harrison‚Äôs fake, beautiful face. But I needed to think rationally, and I needed to ensure that I didn‚Äôt just wind up angering him enough to the point where he‚Äôd want to inflict pain on me. So I sat down in my living room, with Sonny on my lap, and began to knit. There‚Äôs nothing better to calm me down, except, of course, something sweet. But the lungs sitting in my sink put me off from eating anything.¬†



The next day, I woke up even earlier than I usually did. That was because I wanted to get the bag of lungs into my car without having to explain anything to my nosy neighbors. They mean well and are such sweethearts, but I did not have the patience to be dealing with them that day. Lucky for me, they were still asleep when I loaded the bag into my trunk. I made sure to leave food for Sonny and water, and made sure that the door stayed locked. Double and triple checking. I didn‚Äôt know how Dr. Harrison had made it inside, but I wanted to make sure that it stayed locked and that Sonny didn‚Äôt find it open and wander off.¬†



I drove to the clinic and soon arrived at the time I would usually be waking up to leave. The sun was just rising on the horizon, and the birds were chirping their little hearts out. I contemplated whether I should just wait in my car until I was supposed to come in, but the thought of the bag ripping open and leaking in my trunk made me get out and decide to just enter the clinic. If nothing else, I could at least talk to Wilson until Dr. Harrison arrived. So I got out of my car, walked back over to my trunk, and grabbed the lungs. And doing my best not to throw up again, entered the clinic.¬†



However, when I entered, I was caught off guard to see that Wilson wasn‚Äôt standing where he usually did. I thought that maybe he was just in one of the offices, keeping himself entertained, but after some searching, I couldn‚Äôt find him at all. He‚Äôd just vanished. I walked over to the alarm for the building and saw that it hadn‚Äôt been tripped or anything, so to my confusion and a little sadness, I took my seat at my desk and waited. I placed the trash bag on the floor and kept my purse with me. I wasn‚Äôt going to risk the bread creature rummaging through my bag again.¬†



My eyes were glued to the door, waiting for someone to appear. Be it Dr. Harrison, Wilson even Rachel, I wanted someone to show up. As I waited, spinning my pen around my thumb, I started to hear the trash bag begin to rustle. I looked down at it, and to my horror, I saw that the bread creature had somehow ripped a hole in the bag and was starting to chew on the lungs inside.¬†



‚ÄúGet off of that!‚Äù I shouted at it, instinctively trying to kick it away from the bag. It screeched at me with a mouth I could best describe as a crab mixed with a piranha's mouth. All of its different colored human eyes were looking around in various directions and I could tell that I pissed it off. I looked around for something to distract it with. I noticed a big binder clip that I used to keep a stack of files held together, and quickly grabbed it to show to the creature. It quickly stopped hissing at me, and I watched as all of its eyes stared at the paperclip, and the pupils dilated to giant sizes. ‚ÄúGo get it‚Ä¶thing!‚Äù I shouted at it before throwing the paperclip down the hall behind me. The speed at which the thing ran after it on its black noodle limbs astonished me, I could only compare it to a house centipede with how quickly it ran after the metal object.¬†



‚ÄúHopefully that keeps it entertained,‚Äù I sighed, leaning back in my chair and looking down at the trash bag. I kicked it away with my feet and stifled a gag as I watched blood slowly start to ooze out of the bite marks the creature had made. After what felt like an eternity, Dr. Harrison arrived. He looked over at me and quickly smiled excitedly. I didn‚Äôt return his smile.¬†



‚ÄúSir? Care to explain this?‚Äù I asked him, reaching down to grab the bag and placing it on the counter. He looked at the bag and seemed to be a little confused about what I was talking about. He closed the distance between us and opened up the bag, peering inside it.¬†



‚ÄúOh, that. You didn‚Äôt like it?‚Äù He looked at me with his big, stupid puppy dog eyes. I wanted so badly to smack him across the face, but I knew the violence was my last course of action. And it would likely only cause him to grow enraged with me.¬†



‚ÄúJames, why would I want a pair of lungs? Whose do these even belong to?‚Äù It was only then that I began to worry. Had Dr. Harrison hurt someone I knew? Had he hurt Phillip? I clenched my fists at my side and waited for an answer from him. I felt like a mother scolding her child, but after what Dr. Harrison had told me he‚Äôd done to his mother, I hoped I wouldn‚Äôt meet a similar fate.¬†



‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶the roses and flowers weren‚Äôt doing it. So I thought‚Ä¶I dunno, maybe you‚Äôd like them?‚Äù He seemed so pathetic all of a sudden. He could‚Äôve gotten me chocolates, stuffed animals, anything other than human organs. How fucked up was his mind that this would be his next logical step up? Then I thought back to everything I knew about him and everything he‚Äôd done up to that point. And was honestly surprised he didn‚Äôt start with giving me human organs.¬†



‚ÄúWhere did they come from, James?‚Äù I demanded to know, crossing my arms at him and narrowing my eyes at him. He looked at me with his sad green eyes and sighed.¬†



‚ÄúIt was just from a patient, Maggie. Don‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù he said with an exasperated sigh. As if he were the one in the wrong here.¬†



‚ÄúYou broke into my house, read my mail, left me lungs in the fridge, and expect me not to be worried or upset by this, James?‚Äù I asked him, tapping my foot on the carpeted floor. He looked at me quizically before staring back at the floor, lost in thought about something.¬†



‚ÄúIf you keep doing these things to me, James. I swear to God I‚Äôm not only calling Mr. Sinclair, but I‚Äôm quitting for real this time. And no amount of money is going to keep me here.‚Äù I had reached my limit with him, and he stared at me with a mix of horror, shock, and sadness.¬†



‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt! We had a deal!‚Äù He reached out and grabbed me by the arms, digging his nails into my soft arms. I let out a scream and quickly kicked him in the shins to make him let go of me, which he quickly did.¬†



‚ÄúForget the deal!‚Äù I screamed at him, walking over to my reception area and heading towards the ancient rotary phone. James, after rubbing his bruised shin, looked up and quickly ran over to me. He grabbed me by the sweater neck and pulled me away from the phone.¬†



‚ÄúOkay! I promise I‚Äôll stop!‚Äù He pleaded, getting on his knees before me and staring up at me with a face that screamed desperation. I stared down at him and then over to the phone. Mr. Sinclair had a deep hold on Dr. Harrison, and I dreaded to find out just what he and his evil shadow were capable of.¬†



‚ÄúYou better keep your promise. Now, please get up, we‚Äôre opening soon, sir.‚Äù I pulled away from him and left him kneeling on the floor. After a few minutes, he pulled himself off the floor. He took the bag with him and disappeared into one of the consultation rooms.¬†



I lay back in my chair and let out a loud, shaky breath as my heart felt as if it was going to burst through my chest. That could‚Äôve ended horribly for me if Dr. Harrison had lost his temper. I was lucky that, for whatever reason, he seemed so desperate to keep me around here. And that was most likely the only reason I was still alive after standing up to him. I reached a shaky hand over to a stack of papers and started trying to do some work. I didn‚Äôt get much done by the time Rachel walked into work, her face mask still firmly placed on her face.¬†



‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the idiot?‚Äù She asked in a muffled voice as she walked up to my desk. I looked up at her, thinking for a second she was talking about me. That was until I remembered that this entire time, Wilson hadn‚Äôt shown up at all. I stared at Rachel for a moment before turning to see if Wilson would somehow magically appear.¬†



‚ÄúI have no idea. I got here even earlier than I usually do, and he wasn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Both of us looked concerned. Where could Wilson have gone off to? Suddenly, as if hearing our calls, Wilson walked in through the front doors. He was covered from head to toe in leaves, branches, and thorns. And held gently but firmly in his hand was a white lily. He quickly ran over to us and presented the flower to Rachel.¬†



‚ÄúWha-‚Äù She sputtered, staring at the flower and slowly removing her face mask. The scar on her right cheek was deep and had only begun to heal, and I could see why Rachel hid it. But in that moment, she stared at this single flower, completely entranced and confused. ‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶did you get this?‚Äù She asked, reaching out to take the flower from Wilson.¬†



‚ÄúWell. I felt horrible about not being able to protect you. And I heard you talking with Maggie that a white lily is your favorite flower. So last night I left the clinic to look for one! It was kinda hard to find, but I found one!‚Äù he said with a big smile, completely unfazed by the leaves and sticks that were protruding from his body.¬†



Rachel was completely stunned silent as she held the flower delicately in her hands. She looked back up at Wilson, and I could see that tears were starting to form in her pretty blue eyes. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶is the nicest thing a guy has ever done for me.‚Äù She sniffled as the tears started flowing from her eyes. I quickly tapped her on the shoulder and handed her the box of tissues that I keep on my desk. ‚ÄúThank you so much, Wilson. This means so much to me.‚Äù She sniffled as she wiped her eyes with my tissues.¬†



Wilson smiled happily and finally took notice of all the foliage stuck to him. He laughed it off as he brushed them off himself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad my little adventure wasn‚Äôt in vain! I hope it makes you feel better, Ms. Rachel!‚Äù He gave the two of us a little salute before he took his usual post by the door. Rachel stared at her flower for a few more minutes before taking it with her back into one of the consultation rooms.¬†



It was possibly the sweetest ever interaction that I‚Äôd witnessed at the clinic, and it left my heart completely melted. Wilson has always been such a big sweetheart, and to see him go so far as to apologize to Rachel was just absolutely precious to see. We finally opened the clinic, and it proceeded surprisingly smoothly. Only one rowdy patient had to be dealt with, and even then, one look from Wilson was enough to quiet him down into submission. Time flew by, and before I knew it, it was lunchtime. I sat in my chair for a few minutes, wondering if I should even bother going to lunch. But when my tummy started rumbling, I figured I might as well. I stood up from my desk and made a quick scan around me to ensure that Dr. Harrison didn‚Äôt sneak up on me again.¬†



When I was sure that he was nowhere to be seen, I got up from my desk and walked over to the entrance. I smiled at Wilson as he held the door open for me. Normally, I would‚Äôve gone to inform Dr. Harrison that I was leaving, but I wanted nothing to do with him for right now. And maybe depriving him of seeing me would just add to the punishment I was giving him. Arriving at the coffee shop, I was surprised to see it so busy at this hour. I sighed in annoyance and contemplated maybe going somewhere else, but I decided that I deserved a treat today, and elected to stand in line with everyone else.¬†



Luckily enough, the line moved along just fine, and soon I was face to face with Phillip again. He met me with a smile and quickly started to make my order. I thought about not getting Dr. Harrison his order of black coffee, but the thought of depriving him of caffeine was even too much for me, so I would just give it to Rachel to give to him.¬†



‚ÄúSo, have you thought about it?‚Äù Phillip asked me as he made my latte. I stared at him for a moment before remembering his invitation to lunch the day before. I felt my face go flush again as I stared at him.¬†



‚ÄúI was thinking, dinner might be better?‚Äù I asked him, smiling as I pointed towards the chocolate croissants and requested three of them. He nodded and grabbed the tongs to get them. ‚ÄúIt would just be easier for me, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù I giggled a little, feeling like an idiot for being so forward with him.¬†



‚ÄúSure! I can pick you up if you want.‚Äù He offered, placing my croissants into a bag. I was so excited to hear that he wanted to go to dinner with me. But I already had a car, so it would just make sense to meet somewhere.¬†



‚ÄúI can meet you there after work.‚Äù I offered, as I handed him my card to pay for my order. He smiled and nodded after he swiped my card and handed it back to me. I quickly reached into my purse and pulled out a sticky note and a pen. I quickly scribbled down my phone number with a heart next to it and handed it to him. He took it with a smile and nodded, before handing my my order and calling for the next customer behind me.¬†



I was giddy with excitement over my very first proper date. All the way back to work, I was giggling to myself and imagining where we would go. Finally arriving back at work, it was nice to see that nothing horrible had happened while I had gone off to get lunch. I handed Dr. Harrison‚Äôs black coffee to Rachel to give him, and I could tell she had love in her mind as well.¬†



I sat back down at my desk and picked my phone up to see that I had a message from an unknown number. My heart fluttered when I opened it and saw the text that had been sent my way. An address with a smiley face and a heart.¬†



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Philip, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Dr. Harrison asked. I looked up from my phone to see that he was standing on the other side of my desk. He had a mix of anger and sadness on his face. I stared at him for a moment before clearing my throat and turning my phone off.¬†



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs any of your business, sir. In fact, don‚Äôt you have a surgery to get to?‚Äù I looked at him and tapped the file that was in front of both of us. He looked down at it and let out a defeated sigh as he grabbed the manila folder and sauntered off to the surgery room. I sighed and ate my croissant, annoyed that he‚Äôd returned to his sad, mopey self. But if it meant he stopped stalking me, then I could live with it.¬†



As closing time came around and the last few patients left, I looked up from my paperwork to see Rachel approaching Wilson. I set my pen down and watched what was about to unfold. Rachel was holding the lily again and looked up at Wilson, who smiled down at her.



‚ÄúI was wondering. If maybe, you‚Äôd wanna go to lunch together? Tomorrow,‚Äù she asked him. He looked confused at first before seemingly figuring out that she wanted the two of them to go and eat together. He quickly nodded with excitement and wrapped his arms around her in a big hug.¬†



‚ÄúI would love to!‚Äù he shouted excitedly, letting her go before looking down at the clothes he seemingly was always wearing. ‚ÄúUm, is it okay if I go like this?‚Äù he asked her. She smiled and tapped him on the arm.¬†



‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll go clothes shopping too.‚Äù She giggled before waving goodbye to him. I couldn‚Äôt help but kick my feet in excitement at the new blossoming relationship between these two. It gave me hope for my own that was starting soon. I stood up from my desk and was about to leave when I was suddenly stopped by Dr. Harrison, blocking my way.¬†



‚ÄúWhat is it now, sir?‚Äù I asked him, almost sure that he was going to try and stop me. He looked down at me before getting out of my way and letting me leave. But before I left completely, he left me with his haunting line.¬†



‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt go through your mail,‚Äù he said as I left the clinic. I didn‚Äôt truly process that until I was back in my car and inputting the address Phil had given me into my GPS. Was he lying? I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him to do that, but he had admitted to being the one to break into my house and leave the lungs. But if he hadn‚Äôt broken into my mailbox. Then who the hell did?¬†



As I drove to the destination that Phil had sent me, I was confused to find that it led to a parking garage. I stared at the building for a moment, and shot a text to Phil asking if I was at the right place. He confirmed that it was, and told me that he wanted to walk together to the restaurant he had chosen. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and drove into the garage. Finding a parking spot, I exited my car and locked it.¬†



‚ÄúThere she is!‚Äù Phil said excitedly as I exited my car. I looked over and smiled upon seeing him. I closed the distance between us and threw my arms around him. I was so happy to begin my first-ever date. That was quickly cut short when Phil stabbed me in the stomach.¬†



I let out a surprised gasp and pulled away from him. Blood began to pour out of my stomach as I quickly tried to cover the wound with my hands. I looked back at Phil and saw that he had a switchblade in his hand. He smiled at me with nothing but contempt in his eyes.¬†



‚ÄúW-what are you doing?!‚Äù I screamed, trying to turn away and run from him. But he quickly grabbed my hair and yanked me back to him. He held his knife up to my throat and quickly succeeded in silencing me by doing so.¬†



‚ÄúYou fat bitches are so easy to manipulate.‚Äù He laughed at me, pressing the knife deeper into my neck. ‚ÄúYou really thought I would date someone like you? Yeah right!‚Äù He laughed at me. I tried to struggle against him and reach into my purse for my pepper spray, but I could feel my strength leaving me as blood continued to seep through my stomach wound.¬†



‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs make this nice and easy, yeah?‚Äù He asked me, and I knew for sure that I was going to die here in this parking garage. And I would‚Äôve.¬†



But suddenly, Phil let go of me and dropped his knife. I staggered forward and turned to look at him. He was standing there completely motionless like a statue. I staggered forward but soon lost feeling in my legs and collapsed to the floor. When I managed to look up again, I saw something exiting from the darkness of the parking garage, with bright green shining eyes staring directly at me.¬†



‚ÄúJ‚Ä¶ames?‚Äù I croaked out as I slowly began to lose consciousness.¬†



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Maggie. I‚Äôll make sure he suffers for doing this to you.‚Äù He reached out to hold my hand and gently squeezed it. I nodded and slowly drifted off to sleep. To think that my stalker had just saved me from a murderer.¬†

The entire atmosphere of the clinic had changed. Wilson felt horrible about being unable to protect Rachel from the crazed patient, Rachel was inconsolable after the attack on her and took to wearing a face mask to cover most of it. And Dr. Harrison wasn‚Äôt much better after I had walked in on him muttering to himself and murdering the patient who had attacked Rachel. What was strange in all of this was that Dr. Harrison continued to act as if I hadn‚Äôt seen him doing it.¬†



I know that he does these things, and I willingly choose to forget them just so I can continue to collect my paycheck and go home, but actually to see him doing it and then just going on as if nothing happened was unsettling. The next day, he came up to my desk with a big bouquet of flowers. A giant one with roses, daisies, and other flowers. I thought that they might have been for Rachel, but then he told them they were for me. And he didn‚Äôt stop. Every day since then, he‚Äôs brought me more and more flowers. Some of them with boxes of chocolates or with teddy bears, some enclosed in glass to keep them forever fresh.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to develop a pollen allergy.‚Äù I sighed as I tried to find space for his latest bouquet. I usually took them home and just left them until they wilted, or even gave them to random couples I came across on my walk home from work. But during working hours, I had to suffer with them around me. I don‚Äôt hate flowers, but this many of them were an assault on my nostrils and my eyesight from how bright and vibrant they were.¬†



After finally finding space on my desk to place this latest bouquet, I looked up and noticed Wilson staring down at me with a little pout. He looked like a big dog after he had been scolded for peeing on the carpet or something. It was always hard to remind myself that Wilson wasn‚Äôt a real person. He was some strange creation that Dr. Harrison had created to be our security guard, and could easily at any time turn into a horrible blob monster. And yet it was impossible not to love him. After our first meeting and his reformation into a human shape, he‚Äôd taken on a more Security guard-like appearance. With muscles and a taller stance, it seemed like he could change his appearance whenever he wanted.¬†



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Wilson? Are you still upset about not being able to protect Rachel?‚Äù I asked him, reaching a hand out to touch his face to comfort him. While he looked human and his skin looked like skin, once you touched it, it felt like pottery clay. I felt that if I pushed deep enough on his skin, I‚Äôd leave behind subtle impressions of my fingerprints.¬†



He nodded in response to my question and looked at me with his sad, greyish-green eyes. ‚ÄúI want to apologize to her, but she won‚Äôt talk to me.‚Äù He sighed and looked over at the flowers around me. ‚ÄúMaybe if I give her one of those?‚Äù he asked, lifting his head from my hand and looking at the flowers. ‚ÄúDo you know which ones she likes?‚Äù he asked me, carefully touching one of the roses with his hands.¬†



‚ÄúWell, I can try and ask her,‚Äù I told him, smiling as I watched him interact with the flower. It reminded me that I don't think Wilson ever left the clinic. The time when he was keeping people outside from entering was the first time I‚Äôd ever seen him leave. So I was left to wonder where exactly he would even go to get whatever flower Rachel wanted.¬†



‚ÄúThank you, Maggie,‚Äù he said with a smile, and he gently patted the rose he had been touching like it was a dog and returned to his post by the door. As if on cue, after he‚Äôd returned to his post, Rachel came through the door. Watching her walk into work now was soul-crushing. She was hunched over and shuffling like some kind of zombie or undead corpse. Like she‚Äôd lost all the will to do anything at all.¬†



‚ÄúHey, Rachel?‚Äù I called out to her. She turned her head to look at me, a face mask firmly on her face. She shuffled over to my reception desk and pulled the mask down a little. Once she did, I was able to see that the stitches that had been there for the past few days had been removed by Dr. Harrison and that now only a long and angry scar remained.¬†



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked me. Not even a comment on my weight or anything, this was serious. Her voice was defeated and beaten down. It was a miracle that she was even able to drag herself into work nowadays. I couldn‚Äôt imagine how Dr. Harrison could even be using her as his nurse.¬†



‚ÄúWell, I was just wondering what your favorite flower is. All these flowers have me in that sort of headspace.‚Äù I told her with a smile, turning on the approachable charm that usually made people open up to me. Rachel looked at me before tearing her blue eyes off of me to look at the flowers around me.¬†



‚ÄúWhy? Not like he‚Äôs going to bring me any.‚Äù She sighed, turning to leave my desk. I looked over at Wilson and saw that he was panicking a little. I had to think of something quick.¬†



‚ÄúHe actually is. He just doesn‚Äôt know what flowers you enjoy, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù I figured that even if she didn‚Äôt fully believe me, if there was even a chance of Dr. Harrison giving her some flowers, she‚Äôd at least tell me. She stopped and looked back at me. She didn‚Äôt believe me, but finally she shrugged her shoulders.¬†



‚ÄúWhite lilies.‚Äù Was her response before she left to join Dr. Harrison in the back of the clinic to begin work. I looked over at Wilson and gave him a thumbs-up. He gave me one, and I could tell he was happy with the outcome. The rest of the day continued as it usually did. Wilson took special care with the patients now, and even before any of them thought of laying a hand on me, they had Wilson practically breathing down their neck.¬†



Once lunch finally rolled around, I stretched in my chair and let out a soft yawn. The rush had died down, and as such, it was the perfect opportunity for me to go and get lunch. Standing up from my chair, I was about to go and tell Dr. Harrison that I was going to go to lunch. As I turned around, however, he was already standing behind me with a big tooth grin on his face.¬†



‚ÄúOh! Hello, Dr. Harrison. I was just about to tell you that I was leaving.‚Äù I told him, feeling my heart leap out of my chest in shock. ‚ÄúDo you want your usual?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúYes, thank you so much, Maggie.‚Äù He told me, his smile wide and his eyes shining so bright I thought I‚Äôd go blind by staring at them for too long. I shielded myself with my hand before quickly grabbing my bag from behind me. As I turned to leave, though, he asked me something. ‚ÄúAre you going to meet Philip again?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúMost likely,‚Äù I told him, Philip was always working around this time, so it would be logical that I would see him again. I thought back to walking in on Dr. Harrison murdering the patient so violently and listening to his mutterings as he did so. He‚Äôd gotten upset upon learning that Philip and I enjoyed flirting with each other. ‚ÄúIs that a problem, sir?‚Äù I asked him.¬†



‚ÄúNo, not at all,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI was simply wondering, was all.‚Äù He laughed it off, his eye twitching like crazy as he did so. ‚ÄúEnjoy your lunch, Maggie!‚Äù He waved me goodbye as I left the reception area. Why did he care so much? We weren‚Äôt dating. I was practically forced to work here with him because he couldn‚Äôt handle me quitting on him. So why was he making such a big deal over me flirting with someone?¬†



I waited in my car for a moment, my eyes firmly towards the clinic, wondering if Dr. Harrison was staring back at me from behind one of the windows. After a few more minutes, I started up my car and drove to the coffee shop. Arriving there and entering the shop, I was immediately calmed by the smell of the freshly ground coffee and the lovely classical music that the shop played over its loudspeakers.¬†



‚ÄúHey, Mags,‚Äù Philip said with a smile as I approached the counter. He was already getting my order ready. I smiled back at him and started to fish through my bag for my wallet. And then I noticed that my wallet was missing. I started to panic slightly. Had I dropped it at the office? Or on the way here? But when I felt bread crumbs at the bottom of my purse again, I let out a deep and annoyed sigh. I had to stop leaving my bag on the floor.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Phil. I left my wallet at the clinic.‚Äù I told him, turning to go and exit the shop. I figured I was going to have to hurry back and try and bargain my wallet back from the lost and found bread thief.¬†



‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry about that. This one's on the house.‚Äù He told me, still making my latte and smiling at me. I stopped and turned to look at him. ‚ÄúJust keep this between me and you.‚Äù He said with a wink and a smile as he turned to pour Dr. Harrison‚Äôs cup of black coffee. I smiled and walked back over to the counter, noticing that, for once, there was a muffin available among the options of pastries.¬†



‚ÄúCan you also spot me that muffin? I never get to have one of those.‚Äù I pointed to the muffin that was tantalizingly sitting in the display case. Philip nodded and placed my drinks on the counter, before picking up his tongs and getting the muffin for me, and placing it in the bag. ‚ÄúThank you so much, Phil. I owe you one.‚Äù I told him as I took my order from him.¬†



‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind going to lunch sometime with you,‚Äù he told me as he leaned on the counter and smiled at me. I looked at him and felt my face get warmer. This was the first time a guy had ever asked me to go on a date with him. I thought back to what Dr. Harrison had asked me and what I had seen him doing to a patient. But this is my life, and I make the decisions.¬†



‚ÄúI would love to, Philip,‚Äù I told him with a smile. Turning to leave, I was suddenly scared out of my shoes upon seeing Dr. Harrison standing outside the window of the coffee shop with his face pressed against the glass. The anger on his face was palpable, and I was worried that he‚Äôd break the glass with how hard he had his hands pressed against the glass. I quickly hurried outside of the shop and over to him.¬†



‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?!‚Äù I asked him, pushing him away from the glass before Philip could notice him glaring into the coffee shop. ‚ÄúYou have a surgery you‚Äôre supposed to be doing!‚Äù He stared at me with rage in his eyes as he looked down on me.¬†



‚ÄúIs that him?‚Äù he asked, motioning towards the coffee shop. ‚ÄúWhat did he say to you?‚Äù He narrowed his eyes at me, and they began to shine brightly, and my head began to throb. He was trying to control me again. I shook my head and quickly shoved his drink into his chest, hoping that some of the scalding liquid would spill on him,¬†



‚ÄúNo, he doesn‚Äôt work today.‚Äù I lied to him, hoping to protect Philip. And glad that this time he hadn‚Äôt written on either of the cups. ‚ÄúAnd even if it was, why would you care if it was?‚Äù He took the coffee from me and stared at me.¬†



‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre mine! You belong to me, Maggie!‚Äù he shouted. I looked back at the coffee shop and was glad that Philip was helping another customer. I scoffed at Dr. Harrison, wishing that both of my hands weren‚Äôt preoccupied with holding things so that I could smack him.¬†



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt belong to you, James! Just because I agreed to continue working for you, does not mean that I belong to you.‚Äù I turned to leave, and as I did, I felt him reach out a grab my arm. He dug his nails into my soft skin, and I let out a pained yelp. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt let go of me, I swear to God I‚Äôll call Mr. Sinclair,‚Äù I warned him. That got him to let go of me quickly. I didn‚Äôt bother turning around to look at him and just continued back to my car. I sat in it and slammed the door shut behind me.¬†



I didn‚Äôt want to go back to work, in fact, those same thoughts of quitting bubbled back to the surface. But one thing is keeping me working here. The money. And not because of how well it pays. The reason I‚Äôm staying for the money is to help my parents. My dad was in a car accident that left him quadriplegic and sent my parents into a spiraling amount of medical debt. I send them a vast majority of the money I earn from this hellhole. And for my family, I‚Äôll do anything, even deal with Dr. Harrison.¬†



So after reminding myself of why I‚Äôm doing this in the first place, I started the drive back to the clinic. Arriving back at the clinic and finding it functioning normally, I sat back at my reception desk and quickly found my wallet on the floor. Looking through it, I was glad to see that everything was there. The bread creature must‚Äôve been disappointed not to find anything shiny and had abandoned it. Dr. Harrison arrived soon after I got situated and wordlessly walked past me back to the surgery he‚Äôd abandoned.¬†

¬†

The rest of the day went by as normal. I finished the paperwork I had to do and looked over at Wilson, who smiled back at me and waved. I waved back at him and filed away the last of my paperwork. I looked up at the schedule and saw that Dr. Harrison and Rachel would be doing a facial reconstruction. Those usually took the rest of the day, and since closing time was quickly approaching, I decided to just head home early. The less time I had around Dr. Harrison, the better.¬†



I said goodbye to Wilson and went off to the parking lot, making sure that the bread creature hadn‚Äôt taken anything from my purse or my person. Once I confirmed that I had everything, I sat in my car and lay back in my chair. Just as I was about to leave and start my car, I heard my ringtone. I groaned, anticipating that it was probably Dr. Harrison again. But to my immense relief and joy, I saw that it was my mom calling me.¬†



‚ÄúHi, Momma!‚Äù I answered excitedly. I have always had a very close relationship with my parents and my mom in particular. I confided almost everything to her, except, of course, what was happening at the clinic, and she did the same with me.¬†



‚ÄúHey, Maggie! I just called to check on you, and to thank you again for helping out with your dad.‚Äù She sounded tired. It made sense, as she was my dad‚Äôs full-time caretaker now. But mom never complained about it, since she loved my dad more than anything on Earth.¬†



‚ÄúOf course, Momma. It was never an option not to help you guys out.‚Äù I told her as I placed my phone on the dashboard mount and started the car up. ‚ÄúSo you received that payment I sent?‚Äù I asked her, pulling out of the parking lot and starting on the route home.¬†



‚ÄúWe did! Thanks to you, we won‚Äôt have to decide between your dad‚Äôs therapy or eating.‚Äù She sounded like she was joking, but I knew full well that their finances were that bad. My parents never wanted me to worry about them, even after my dad‚Äôs accident, but I could tell just how deep in debt they were. From bills past due and in collections, to the fact that I had to stop people from repossessing their car. They‚Äôre stubborn and seldom ask for help even when they so desperately need it.¬†



‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt joke like that, Momma. Otherwise, I‚Äôm gonna end my lease and move back in to help you guys.‚Äù I warned her, which quickly got her to apologize. We talked as I drove back to my apartment. As I was walking to my mailbox and inserting the key to open it, still talking with her, I noticed that the lock had been broken on it.¬†



‚ÄúMaggie? Did you hear what I said, sweetheart?‚Äù My mom asked as I opened my mail locker and saw that someone had gone through it. Letters were opened and their contents were spilled out. Someone had gone through my mail.¬†



‚ÄúLet me call you back, Momma. I love you.‚Äù I blew her some kisses from my end and received some from her end. Hanging up on her and placing my phone back in my purse, I quickly grabbed the letters and started looking through them. Most of them were just bills and junk mail, and I was glad that my bank hadn‚Äôt sent me anything that day.¬†



I grabbed all my open mail and closed my mailbox, determined to call my landlord, and if he didn‚Äôt answer, then the police. I don‚Äôt live in the nicest apartment complex but this was the first time that someone had gone through my mail, and it pissed me off. Walking up to my apartment and inserting the key into the lock, my heart froze in my chest when I saw that it wasn‚Äôt locked. And even worse, the door simply pushed open when I tested to see if the door was truly locked.¬†



Someone had been in my house. Without even thinking, I quickly entered it and pulled the pepper spray out of my bag. I only had one thing on my mind, barging into an apartment that might still have had an intruder in it. My dog.¬†



‚ÄúSonny?!‚Äù I called out to him, worried sick and praying that nothing had happened to him. And to my immense relief, my little corgi came waddling out to greet me in the pink sweater that I had knitted for him. ‚ÄúOh, thank God.‚Äù I sighed, getting on my knees to scoop him up into my arms. He seemed perfectly fine and unaffected by whatever stranger had broken into my home. That wasn‚Äôt much of a surprise, unfortunately, as Sonny is the friendliest dog ever and makes for a terrible guard dog.¬†



As I examined my apartment, Sonny and pepper spray held firmly in both of my arms, it became apparent that nothing had been stolen. I didn‚Äôt exactly have many valuables, besides the many pictures of me and my family. After ensuring that nobody was there, I placed Sonny back on the floor and went about getting him and myself some food.¬†



After I poured out his food and refilled his water, I walked over to the fridge and opened it. I then let out a scream and quickly slammed it closed. I covered my mouth and ran to the toilet to quickly vomit up my lunch. After I had finished and washed my mouth out, I stared back at the fridge. I walked over to it and opened it again.¬†



There in the middle of my fridge were two bleeding masses of flesh left behind in my fridge. Along with that was an envelope leaning against them. I reached out and quickly took the envelope, thankful that I grabbed a corner with no blood on it. I opened the card and quickly read it.¬†



‚ÄúYou leave me breathless.‚Äù I stared at the card and then at my fridge. It was very clear what those two organs were. And even clearer who had sent them. I crumpled the card angrily in my hands and tossed it to the ground. Dr. James Harrison had messed with the wrong girl.¬†

1lmvc05,https://i.redd.it/5fibxw7cyp9f1.jpeg,Hiccup body spray and Chief Stoick oil review!,"Hiccup: Quite a complex scent when you first spray it. It's a combination of a very fresh musky men's cologne and beachy notes, green, almost vegetal notes, and a general ""wet"" scent. It's quite outdoorsy but in a wet summer nature way, not a cold/piney way. I also need to reiterate that this is extremely masculine smelling. While scent has no gender, this is the most typical ""man"" scent lush have ever done from everything I've sampled and the men's fresh cologne note is the most overbearing scent in this spray. It is the most obvious scent once it dries down as well. The other notes are still there, just not as pronounced. It definitely has an Axe/Lynx/Old Spice vibe to it as others have said, but it is much more complex than anything I've smelled from those brands. Unfortunately the spray is not very strong and the projection is rather poor. I sprayed my partner about 5 or 6!!! times. If you know lush you know that's an ungodly amount of sprays. After an hour, he smelled when you got very close to him but that's it.

Chief Stoick: Basically the opposite of the spray, quite warm and cozy. The definition of a unisex scent. Dark roast coffee, tobacco, and chocolate are the notes I am getting. It has a subtle sweetness to it. Both gourmand lovers and non gourmand people will like this. I can smell this in my hair still and it's been a few hours. It mostly smells like vanilla-ed tobacco at this point. It's a rather straightforward scent, it smells pretty much exactly how you'd imagine it.

My partner and I like both a lot and will be keeping them. The projection of the body spray is disappointing for the price though.

1lmvbtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lmvbtd/if_your_partner_brings_pets_into_the_relationship/,"If your partner brings pets into the relationship, do you split vet bills or does the ‚Äúowner‚Äù cover them solely?","My partner brought 2 pets into our relationship. They have mentioned many times that regardless of what relationship they are in, if the relationship ends the pets are *theirs* and that‚Äôs fair to me. 

We have been together several years and in the past they have paid for the pet food. We haven‚Äôt had any expenses for the pets in the last several years other than food, until recently. Within the last 6 months one pet almost lost their life and medical treatment cost us about $8k. The other pet had a medical emergency as well and that costed about an additional $1-2k. 

We did not have liquid cash or savings available to pay for this. I have a great credit score and a large line of credit available and an understanding of the pros and cons of credit cards. (Meaning I understand the urgency in paying them off required.. I have previously paid off over $50k of credit card debt completely by myself.) My partner has never had one before and their credit is not that great. We used my credit to split the vet bills between 2- low interest credit cards, unfortunately both in my name. 

I mentioned to my partner a few months ago that I‚Äôm not super comfortable having *all* of our combined debt, not just vet bills, (a total of about $15k) in my name, and that I‚Äôd like them to look at their credit card or loan options. I mentioned this several times and every time they acted kind of strange and dismissive / reluctant‚Ä¶ one time I even stood next to them while they had their phone out and said ‚Äújust download the credit karma app, it makes it super easy to see what your options are and how much you‚Äôre likely to get approved for. You should just download it and check real quick!‚Äù And they wouldn‚Äôt.. with their phone in their hands they acted sheepish and avoidant and put their phone down and walked away.. it really bothered me and was a red flag.

They have mentioned before that if we ever broke up they promise they would pay me back for the entirety of what they owe me. I believe them, but I just want to see more effort *now* to help pay this off before the debt continues to grow bigger. It‚Äôs uneasy seeing interest charges of $200+ dollars accumulating‚Ä¶

Currently I am the breadwinner. However I work just under 40/ hours a week. They work 10-20 right now. They run a business that we own together while I have a day job during the week, and on weekends we do our business stuff together if needed. Things are slow for both our jobs and we‚Äôre barely scraping by. I have applied to many other jobs, things like baristas, assistants, even other full time higher paying positions. I have had several interviews but nothing has been fruitful. I have suggested many times that they also apply to other jobs and I‚Äôve sent them applications to several as well. They applied to atleast 1 or 2 that I know of, but that‚Äôs all. They say they prefer to spend their energy growing our business. While I understand and agree, I also think time and place‚Ä¶ prioritize. We need money *now*, so go find another job to make some extra cash so we can chip away at this debt. 

Looking back at the payments, 90% of them are made by me. I have also just found out that they have been putting *everything* of theirs onto our joint credit card‚Ä¶ audible membership, coffee, car washes, beer, gas. Etc etc‚Ä¶ they haven‚Äôt made a payment towards it since march, and the last several thousand dollars of payments were made by me. 

I‚Äôm feeling like I never should have done this, but don‚Äôt know what the other options would have been‚Ä¶ I offered to help by letting them use a card of mine as a financial option, and seeing as we are in a partnership and I consider this and our pets my family, I have been paying towards the cards and considering half the bill as ‚Äúmine.‚Äù We have been together just shy of 5 years, and while we don‚Äôt plan on marriage, we planned on the essence of marriage without the legality.

However, their reluctancy to contribute towards the bill and taking on any in their name, and now their ‚Ä¶ dare I say laziness?‚Ä¶ is making me nervous. It makes me feel like I no longer want to pay towards this debt and let them cover it the rest of the expense. They keep telling me they‚Äôre going to pursue things more and make a large payment soon. But, I‚Äôll believe it when I see it.

I would like to add though that in the event we did breakup, I know that their parents would atleast offer to give them a loan to pay me, or would directly buy the debt from me. They‚Äôre pretty wealthy. So I‚Äôm not too worried about losing out on this money entirely as I am concerned that my partner doesn‚Äôt seem to want to grow up and contribute in some aspects.

1lmvah2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Venturex/comments/1lmvah2/jfk_lounge/,JFK Lounge,"Was a bit disappointed with this one. Maybe I had higher expectations since this lounge is bigger than the one in Vegas but it paled in comparison. 

Food selection: This lounge does offer a cheesemonger & bagel section. I didn‚Äôt try the cheesemonger as there was a long wait. The bagels were pretty good, I liked it! Probably my favorite thing from this lounge. You were also able to order 4 small dishes from the hot section which included mac and cheese, pork shank, chicken paillard, and white bean spinach soup. The Mac and cheese & pork shank weren‚Äôt bad but the chicken was disappointing. The small plates section didn‚Äôt have much of a selection, I definitely loved the Vegas small plates selection more. The cookies weren‚Äôt warm and the croissants were pretty stale and hard. For the grab n go section here, you have to ask for it at the bagel section. Unlike Vegas, you can‚Äôt just grab it yourself.

Beverages: At the bagel section, you can also order coffee however they ran out of coffee by the time we got into the lounge (1PM). They don‚Äôt leave the tea bags out so you‚Äôll need to order it at the bagel section. Their soda dispensers and ice machine were out of order so we had to walk over to the bar to get our drinks. 

Other: There are 6 neutral bathrooms here along with 2 shower rooms. The service was great as well, the staff were nice and friendly! 

Overall this lounge wasn‚Äôt bad, maybe we had a lot of bad luck with the coffee running out, soda & ice machine broken, and the long wait for the cheesemonger. üò≠

¬† A feather-light caress skated down my arm and over my hip. A moment passed as I stirred from the depths of sleep. Hard warmth pressed against my back, sending a series of shivers down my spine.  
  
¬† Only half-awake, I smiled as I blinked open my eyes. The room was dimly lit, telling me that it was way too early to be awake.  
  
¬† Lips brushed against the sensitive spot on my neck, just below my pulse, and another set of fine tremors danced over my skin. Muscles tightened low in my stomach.  
  
¬† The kiss came again, this time over my pulse, and my toes curled.  
  
¬† It was way too early, but who would complain about waking up this way? Not me. If I spent the rest of my life waking up like this, I‚Äôd be a happy girl. So happy.  
  
¬† Rolling onto my back, my sleepy grin froze as my gaze connected with pitch-black, obsidian irises. What the . . . ? Confusion quickly gave way to icy terror that dug deep into every cell and latched onto bone and tissue.  
  
¬† Oh no.

¬† No Titan.  
  
¬† I was sitting up and staring at the empty space in front of me, my heart racing. Scanning the shadowy dorm room, I found no sign of the dangerous and sickening god. Everything was as it had been before I‚Äôd fallen asleep Sunday night. TV across from the bed, turned off. The blinds covering the small window near the bathroom were slightly open and I could see the pale blue light of dawn creeping over the Black Hills, the protected portion of the forest deep within the Northern Hills of South Dakota.  
  
¬† My new home.  
  
¬† Which was sort of like my old home, Radford University. Except this University looked like something straight out of Greece during the time people actively worshipped the gods. And I was surrounded by mythical beings instead of by twenty-somethings whose greatest powers were the ability to perform tasks hungover and with minimal sleep.  
  
¬† Correction. I was a mythical being, actually, and the students at the Covenant University weren‚Äôt very different from mortal students. With the exception of being descendants of gods, and the whole trying-to-kill-each-other thing they had going on right now.  
  
¬† But there was no psychotic Titan lurking in the shadows of my room, preparing to feed on me until I was nothing but a dried-out husk, then do other spiteful, repulsive things that I‚Äî  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt going to think about.  
  
¬† Exhaling, I closed my eyes as I rubbed my palm over my forehead. Just a dream‚Äîa stupid dream. Titans couldn‚Äôt get inside the University. Wards prevented that. The shades could, but I‚Äôd rather face a hundred souls that had escaped Tartarus than see Hyperion‚Äôs or another Titan‚Äôs face again.  
  
¬† I had no idea who the man was that I‚Äôd dreamed about, except that I knew deep in my core that he was a Titan.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJosie?‚Äù came a rough, sleep-heavy and slightly accented voice. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù  
  
¬† My pulse kicked up again, but this time for a very different reason as I twisted around and got an eyeful of possibly the sexiest being alive.  
  
¬† Seth Dio‚Äîhowever you spelled or pronounced his last name‚Äîwas lying on his side. The thin comforter was tangled low around his hips, revealing a whole lot of golden-colored skin‚Äîtaut and ripped skin.  
  
¬† Seth had a legit six-pack. Like, not painted on, or only visible when he was flexing or doing strenuous activities. I half-suspected he was born that way, a baby with a six-pack and rock-hard pecs, doing bicep curls with milk-filled bottles. Speaking of biceps, they were extremely nice too. So were his broad shoulders and tapered waist. And his face?  
  
¬† God.  
  
¬† He was beautiful. Almost too much. Like his features had been carefully pieced together, a collection of perfection‚Äîwhich they had been. Angular, high cheekbones and full, sensual lips you could get lost staring at. Dreaming about. Well, fantasizing about. A straight, flawless nose, and his eyes . . . They were the most stunning ocher color, framed by dark, thick lashes. His arched brows were slightly darker than his blond hair‚Äîhair that he‚Äôd cut recently. I was still getting used to the shorter locks. The soft strands were buzzed close to the skull on the sides and longer on the top, sometimes straight, sometimes a mess of waves. I liked running my palms against the sides, feeling the shorter hair tickle my palms.  
  
¬† I just liked touching Seth in general.  
  
¬† Sometimes I had no idea how he had ended up in my bed. I mean, of course, he was there because I invited him in and wanted him there, but I don‚Äôt think I was the type of girl anyone pictured with someone like him. I wasn‚Äôt knocking myself. I was just being realistic. I was five feet and nine inches of uncoordinated mess most of the time. My hips would‚Äôve been popular back in the fifteen-hundreds or something, when ‚Äúchild-bearing hips‚Äù were all the rage, and I‚Äôm pretty sure my thighs were never in style or going to be. Apparently no amount of training‚Äîkickboxing, grappling, running, defensive or offensive training‚Äîwas going to tighten my stomach or trim my waistline. I wasn‚Äôt thin or willowy, or graceful and demure. I was loud, could be fairly obnoxious, and I rambled.  
  
¬† But Seth liked me. He‚Äôd said I was his salvation.  
  
¬† And I liked him.  
  
¬† A lot.  
  
¬† I was also a demigod, Apollo‚Äôs daughter, so there was that.  
  
¬† And Seth was the Apollyon, the product of a half-blood and pure-blood, created by the recently deceased Ares, and I was already as powerful as I could be, once I got the knack of controlling my newly discovered abilities.  
  
¬† His amber-colored eyes, shining like precious stones, narrowed. ‚ÄúAre you awake? Or is this some kind of creepy sleepwalking thing?‚Äù  
  
¬† My lips twitched into a small grin. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm awake.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo . . .‚Äù He rolled onto his back, sliding an arm behind his head, and I sort of got hung up on watching the way his biceps flexed and rolled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just sitting up and staring at me while I sleep?‚Äù  
  
¬† I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what it looks like.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was actually sitting up and staring at the wall until you interrupted me.‚Äù  
  
¬† He lowered his other hand, resting it low on his flat stomach. From my vantage point, he almost looked nude under the blanket, but unfortunately he wasn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not weird or anything.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù I said, fixing the strap on the tank top I was wearing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre weird.‚Äù  
  
¬† Those lips tipped further up on the corner. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hot.‚Äù  
  
¬† I rolled my eyes again, but I was totally flattered.  
  
¬† His head tilted to the side. ‚ÄúA dream?‚Äù  
  
¬† The warm and fuzzy feeling of flattery faded away, and I nodded.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù I cleared my throat as I pushed my hair back over my shoulder. ‚ÄúJust a weird dream.‚Äù  
  
¬† His stare was intent as he studied me quietly. This wasn‚Äôt the first nightmare I‚Äôd had after the showdown with the Titan. And not just any Titan. Hyperion. The godly being my father had entombed thousands of years ago, and who was now loose, hell-bent on revenge. I‚Äôd somehow sent him packing when my demigod abilities had been unlocked, but he‚Äôd be back.  
  
¬† I knew that.  
  
¬† He and the other Titans that had escaped would keep coming back until we located the other five demigods, unlocked their abilities, and managed to join  
our abilities in order to entomb the Titans back in Tartarus.  
  
¬† Of course, we had no idea where the other demigods were or how we could find them. Or how we were seriously going to entomb them again. Apollo hadn‚Äôt let us in on that information yet.  
  
¬† Though I wanted it to be the last nightmare, so badly, I knew better. Those hours with the Titan had felt like an eternity, and I tried, really tried not to dwell on them. I probably could use some therapy.  
  
¬† Wait. Could demigods get therapy? Like was there a specialist around these parts focusing on the mental health of mystical beings?  
  
¬† Seth‚Äôs fingers brushed over my arm, drawing my attention. Our eyes met. His hand wrapped around my wrist and he dragged me down so that I was half on top of him.  
  
¬† Oh, I liked where this was heading.  
  
¬† His chest was warm under my arms and his hand was steady as he reached up, catching a few strands of my hair. He tucked it back behind my ear and his hand lingered, cradling my cheek. I lowered my mouth to his and kissed him softly. When I lifted my head, his eyes were iridescent.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI liked that,‚Äù he murmured.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo did I.‚Äù Then I remembered something super important. I hadn‚Äôt really forgotten. It had just slipped my mind in the wake of the nightmare. A big goofy smile tugged at my lips. ‚ÄúI think you get more today.‚Äù  
  
¬† He slid his hand around to the nape of my neck. ‚ÄúI think I should get more every day.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course you do, but today is different.‚Äù  
  
¬† Understanding rippled across his features, a slight widening of his eyes and nostrils. A moment of surprise, and seeing that caused pain to flicker through my chest, because he hadn‚Äôt expected me to remember.  
  
¬† Seth expected so very little sometimes.  
  
¬† Pushing away the welling sadness that realization always brought with it, I kissed him again. And then once more, because I wanted to show him, I needed him to know that he had every right to expect the world. ‚ÄúHappy birthday.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJosie . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† The way he whispered my name, so tender and potent, made my breath catch. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs it feel like to be twenty-two?‚Äù  
  
¬† Threading his fingers through my hair, he didn‚Äôt answer immediately. ‚ÄúFeels like twenty-one.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not exciting.‚Äù  
  
¬† He grinned again. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you‚Äôre still twenty and have what? About six months to go before you‚Äôre twenty-one.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a cradle-robber.‚Äù  
  
¬† Seth chuckled and then lifted his head, kissing the corner of my lips. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve been called that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù I smoothed my hand over his chest, enjoying the way he sucked in a sharp breath. I loved that my touch affected him so. ‚ÄúI wanted to get you something, but Amazon doesn‚Äôt really deliver out here, so . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† I really did want to get him something, but since it wasn‚Äôt particularly safe for me to leave, the only option was the campus store, but I doubted Seth wanted a Covenant University mug or hoodie. I couldn‚Äôt even make him dinner since I had no access to a kitchen, so I was a lame girlfriend.  
  
¬† Girlfriend.  
  
¬† I shivered.  
  
¬† That word still felt incredibly new. Shiny. Unfathomable. I think both of us were still discovering each other, and we were taking this slow. Like three-legged-turtle slow. Our relationship was far from perfect. There were obstacles in our path that most couples would never face, like, say, the fact we both had immortal beings gunning for us.  
  
¬† Then there was Seth‚Äôs oftentimes disturbing past.  
  
¬† There was also the possibility of his future getting cut short. I refused to allow that to happen, but wasn‚Äôt yet sure what I could do to stop it.  
  
¬† And I was also pretty sure that my father kind of wanted to murder him.  
  
¬† I really needed to stop thinking about all of that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know what?‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù  
  
¬† Folding his other arm around my waist, he rolled me onto my back and slid on top of me. His weight did crazy things to my senses‚Äîamazing, crazy things. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already given me enough.‚Äù  
  
¬† My brows rose. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou have.‚Äù He lowered his mouth to mine, and when he kissed me there was nothing soft or slow about it.  
  
¬† Seth kissed like a man coming out of an extreme drought. He sipped and he savored, drawing each kiss out of me. He was a man who thoroughly enjoyed kissing, took the scenic route and was absolutely in no hurry to get to the destination.  
  
¬† But I really wanted that destination.  
  
¬† You know, him and me, naked, bodies twisting together and me tossing virginity to the wind.  
  
¬† Seth nipped at my lower lip, eliciting a sharp gasp from me. ‚ÄúMmm,‚Äù he murmured, dragging his hand down my arm, catching the strap from my top. ‚ÄúYou give me that sound.‚Äù  
  
¬† My breaths came out in short bursts as he shifted his weight onto his left arm and rose just far enough that there was the smallest space between us. Those agile fingers worked at the straps of my top until they circled my wrists.  
  
¬† Cold air spread tiny bumps across my bare chest. I watched, in a daze, as he lowered his head and kissed the odd scar that remained after Apollo had unbound my powers.  
  
¬† Seth lifted his lashes, and I saw the smug, daring grin a second before he lowered his head again. The tip of his tongue traced the straight, five-inch line from the bottom to the top. He didn‚Äôt stop there. Oh no, those tiny licks followed the two lines looping around it. He even got what reminded me of wings on either side of the strange scar.  
  
¬† Heat zinged through my veins as he kissed his way from the scar, discovering very, very sensitive areas. Moaning, I skimmed my hand over the shorter strands of his hair, finding the longer ones to curl my fingers around. My back arched, and he settled his hips between my legs.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou gave me these,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôre the gift that keeps on giving.‚Äù  
  
¬† I giggled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a perv.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just speaking the truth.‚Äù His mouth closed over a tip and his tongue did wicked, delightful things. ‚ÄúBest damn birthday gift I‚Äôve ever gotten.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSeth‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† He moved up, swiftly and with startling precision. His mouth closed over mine, cutting off my words. Wasn‚Äôt complaining, not when his tongue moved along mine. Not when my chest was suddenly flattened against his. And definitely not when he did this thing with his hips, rolling them into the perfect spot that really, really made me want to bypass the scenic route and get right to the promised land.  
  
¬† I lifted my leg, draping it over his as I lifted my hips, following his lead. Seth moaned into my mouth, a hot masculine sound that sent a rush of sensations pounding through my body. His hips moved again, and I thought maybe this morning, because it was his birthday, we‚Äôd‚Äî  
  
¬† The alarm on the nightstand went off, shrill and jarring. It screamed that it was time to get up and get to training.  
  
¬† Seth lifted his mouth and groaned. ‚ÄúDamn.‚Äù  
  
¬† My grip in his hair tightened. ‚ÄúWe can ignore it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat would make me a very bad trainer if we did,‚Äù he replied, his lips brushing over mine. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm trying to be a very good trainer.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your birthday,‚Äù I reasoned. ‚ÄúWe can get a late start.‚Äù  
  
¬† His palm brushed over the tip of my breast. ‚ÄúNot a good enough reason.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Monday.‚Äù  
  
¬† He chuckled. ‚ÄúJosie.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat? That‚Äôs a damn good enough reason.‚Äù  
  
¬† Seth kissed me as he pulled the straps of my top up. I was officially shut down. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve improved in the last couple of weeks, but you still have a lot of work to do.‚Äù  
  
¬† I started to frown. ‚ÄúGee. Thanks.‚Äù  
  
¬† Laughing, he rolled off and swung his legs over the bed, standing. He did this with such little effort and with so much grace that I wanted to throat punch him. ‚ÄúGet that sweet ass up and ready. Time to get to work.

I lurched out of the bed, moving like a slightly high Godzilla. ‚ÄúJust because you‚Äôre a Pollyanna, Sethie, doesn‚Äôt mean you can boss me around.‚Äù  
  
¬† He shot me a bland look. ‚ÄúApollyon, Joe. Repeat after me. Apollyon.‚Äù  
  
¬† I grinned.  
  
¬† His eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúYou drive me crazy.‚Äù  
  
¬† Sidestepping him, I looked over my shoulder as I headed to the small adjoining bathroom. ‚ÄúIn a good way?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUndecided.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAss.‚Äù  
  
¬† Seth‚Äôs lips curved up on one corner, making him look downright wicked. He was lucky it was his birthday, so I was going to let the whole ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù thing slide. I opened the bathroom door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJosie?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I turned, startled to find him standing right in front of me. I still couldn‚Äôt get over how quickly and quietly he could move.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI . . .‚Äù He trailed off and then lifted his hands, gently clasping my cheeks. He kissed me, and it was sweet and tender, and so powerful. ‚ÄúThank you for remembering my birthday.‚Äù  
  
¬† And then he was gone.  
  
¬† Out of the room and next door, probably already in the shower, while I was still standing there, staring at the spot where he‚Äôd stood, wondering if no one had ever remembered his birthday before.  
  
¬† Or cared enough to.  
  
¬† This year, this birthday would be different, though.  
  
¬† Chapter 2  
  
¬† Seth  
  
¬† Iwas an idiot to trade spending a few hours in bed with Josie for watching her accidentally set shit on fire when she was supposed to be summoning the air element.  
  
¬† Which was why we were standing outside, far away from any of the buildings, back near the cemetery, even though there was still a brisk chill in the air. It was only in the fifties here. Place never seemed to get that warm. Hopefully, she didn‚Äôt start blowing up headstones and statues next, because I doubted that would go over well with Marcus, the current Dean of the University, who was also not a member of my fan club.  
  
¬† And it was also why getting our asses out of bed and training was so important. Knowing how to fight in hand-to-hand combat was important, but when it came down to facing the Titans, she was going to need to know how to use and control her demigod abilities.  
  
¬† Plus, Luke helped take over during the afternoon sessions, and the first time‚Äîthe last time‚ÄîJosie had used the elemental powers around him, she‚Äôd accidentally blown him into a wall, damn near through it.  
  
¬† Hilarious.  
  
¬† But painful for him.  
  
¬† Josie squinted as she stalked past me, heading for the straw dummy that Deacon had been way too overjoyed to help create. The thing looked like a rather fashionable scarecrow, decked out in a polo shirt and wearing a fedora.  
  
¬† No idea why it had a fedora on.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt ask.  
  
¬† Crossing my arms, I waited until Josie appeared ready. Twenty hours later. She wasn‚Äôt comfortable using the elements, so she paced a lot, shifted her weight, practically prancing around until she stilled.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the head,‚Äù I reminded her. ‚ÄúYou have all this power at your fingertips, but you need to fully understand that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI understand that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, you don‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
¬† Her hands closed into fists as she looked over at me. Her blue eyes were vibrant, very much like her father‚Äôs when he was rocking irises, but when she was frustrated or angry, they reminded me of the deep blue of the Aegean Sea that surrounded the Cyclades.  
  
¬† They went that deep when she was turned on, too.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know I have the power,‚Äù she argued. ‚ÄúDuh.‚Äù  
  
¬† I arched a brow. ‚ÄúYeah, you know you do, but you don‚Äôt really believe it or trust yourself. If you did, you wouldn‚Äôt be setting every damn thing on fire every time you get horny.‚Äù  
  
¬† Her cheeks flushed pink. ‚ÄúI do not!‚Äù  
  
¬† I smirked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was like once or twice.‚Äù She threw up her hands. ‚ÄúOkay, maybe four times. I didn‚Äôt this morning.‚Äù A light sparked in her eyes. ‚ÄúThen again, maybe that just means you were slacking.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs that so? Me slacking?‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúBabe, if you‚Äôd been any more ready this morning, the whole damn dorm would‚Äôve caught on fire.‚Äù  
  
¬† Her entire face went red this time, but that spark in her eyes turned into a flame, and I knew her mind was back in the bed, when I was thanking her for the lovely gift of her breasts.  
  
¬† Josie blinked and muttered, ‚ÄúAssface.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGot a new nickname for you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh. I can‚Äôt wait to hear this.‚Äù  
  
¬† Dipping my chin, I grinned as she watched me. ‚ÄúAnytime you get around me, you get so ready, I‚Äôm just going to start calling you Slip ‚ÄòN Slide.‚Äù  
  
¬† She choked on a strangled laugh. ‚ÄúOh my God, that‚Äôs terrible. If I ever hear you say that again, I might hurt you, Seth. For real.‚Äù  
  
¬† Chuckling, I nodded at the dummy. ‚ÄúTap into the wind, Josie. Feel it coursing through you. You got this.‚Äù  
  
¬† Josie‚Äôs nose wrinkled and then she focused on the dummy. Her hands closed into fists again. Her shoulders rose, and I felt it then‚Äîthe small ripple of power. It flowed in the distance between us, washing over my skin. The kiss of power‚Äîof aether being tapped into and used‚Äîfelt like stepping out into the summer sun.  
  
¬† Locking my jaw, I shifted my stance as I drew in a deep, steady breath and focused on Josie, only her, until the enticing wave of power dissipated.  
  
¬† Lightning cracked overhead. Fat, dark clouds began to form. I lifted my chin, sighing as a raindrop smacked off the bridge of my nose.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShoot,‚Äù she muttered, shoulders drooping.  
  
¬† I pursed my lips as I watched the gray clouds break apart. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lucky,‚Äù I announced dryly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to drench us this time.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù  
  
¬† My lips quirked up. ‚ÄúTry again.‚Äù  
  
¬† Josie did just that. Lightning cracked again. She set the chair I‚Äôd dragged out on fire. The dummy started to smoke at some point, but then the quick shower she summoned put the fire out.  
  
¬† The fedora was a loss.  
  
¬† Finally, near lunchtime, Josie got it. She summoned the element of air, lifting the dummy up and holding it there for several moments.  
  
¬† Each time she tapped into the aether, I felt the kiss of power and used every ounce of control that I had to ignore it. Being around pures had helped me build up some tolerance to the minor displays of power. And I‚Äôd experienced harder shit. For example, the erection this morning was one of them. Denying the level Josie wanted to take our relationship to was the exact opposite of easy, even when I wanted to . . . well, do right by her. Strange concept and all, but behaving myself was hard. So I got this covered.  
  
¬† But it was when we worked with akasha that I almost couldn‚Äôt . . . couldn‚Äôt ignore the allure.  
  
¬† There was nothing more powerful than that, and when it hit the air, it was like touching lightning. It called to me, sang to what existed deep inside me‚Äîthis thing that needed aether as badly as a daimon did. How fucked up was that? Knowing that I shared something in common with the daimons was one of the things that kept me in check, kept this thing inside me locked away.  
  
¬† Josie was the other.  
  
¬† Once the dummy was back on the ground, I made her use the element of air three more times, just to make sure it wasn‚Äôt a fluke. With her, you never knew.  
  
¬† Josie turned to me, pushing a shorter strand of blonde hair out of her face. A tentative smile appeared as she bounced over to where I stood. ‚ÄúI think I finally got the hang of the air element.‚Äù  
  
¬† Truthfully, I couldn‚Äôt say if she finally did have control over it or not, and we wouldn‚Äôt know until she could do it several days in a row. Josie stared up at me, eyes bright and hopeful. I didn‚Äôt want to piss on her parade.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, leaning down and pressing my lips to her forehead. ‚ÄúYou did really good, Josie.‚Äù  
  
¬† Stretching up, she looped her arms around my neck and gave me a quick, tight hug before settling back on her feet.  
  
¬† I stood there. Stared at her for a few moments. Like a creep. Sometimes I  
didn‚Äôt know what to do with her. I could be touchy. Gods knew I had boundary issues. I had no problem being . . . affectionate, but I was not, under any circumstance, used to someone being affectionate with me. Not like this. When it was actually genuine, not forced for one reason or another, and went deeper than a physical thing.  
  
¬† Josie was free with the affection‚Äîthe smiles and the touches, the soft kisses and the closeness.  
  
¬† She blew me away with all of that.  
  
¬† Sometimes I also wondered what I was doing with her, getting involved in a real relationship, because it wasn‚Äôt exactly fair to her. A handful of months ago, I would‚Äôve laughed my ass off at the prospect of something like this, but here I was, in a relationship with Apollo‚Äôs daughter.  
  
¬† And besides all that terrible shit I‚Äôd done in my past and the shit with the aether that I was still struggling with, I literally had no future.  
  
¬† None.  
  
¬† Eventually, once the Titan situation was handled and I survived that, I would be going back to doing the gods‚Äô bitch work, dealing out Remediations. In other words, hunting down and destroying those who had sided with Ares against the Olympian core. And then after that? Whenever I did die, my soul belonged to Hades. There was no promise of tomorrow and no paradise waiting for me.  
  
¬† So doing this with Josie was selfish. Unfair. The odds were stacked against me, against us, and just like I knew Apollo was eventually going to appear at the most inopportune time, she was going to end up hurt by all of this.  
  
¬† But, like I said, I was selfish.  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt walk away from Josie. I had tried to ignore what I was feeling for her. I had tried to leave her the day that I‚Äôd brought her here, to the University, as I‚Äôd been ordered to do, and I hadn‚Äôt been able to do it. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it.  
  
¬† I just hoped she didn‚Äôt end up paying for it in spades later.  
  
¬† Despite where my head had gone, Josie smiled up at me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry.‚Äù  
  
¬† A slight grin tugged at my lips. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù  
  
¬† Josie smacked my arm. ‚ÄúJerk.‚Äù  
  
¬† Pushing the darker thoughts away, I draped my arm over her shoulders. ‚ÄúCome on. Let‚Äôs head to the cafeteria.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan we grab some food and take it back to my room?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù Considering the cafeteria was becoming more of a warzone between the halfs and pures than a place to eat, I didn‚Äôt have a problem with that.  
  
¬† Since the very first birth of the half-blood‚Äîthe child of a pure-blood and a mortal‚Äîthe half-blood race was subjugated by those with pure bloodlines. It was a fucked-up caste system, reminiscent of ancient Greek times, where destinies were fated based on whether or not the blood was considered pure.  
  
¬† Up until recently, the halfs had it bad, absolutely no choice. The Breed Order that had been in place since the beginning stripped them of rights and prohibited the mixing of the two breeds. At the age of eight, halfs had been brought in front of a council of pure-bloods and had been determined if they would be given the Elixir, a serum created by the gods that robbed a half-blood of all free will, and placed into indentured servitude, or if they would go into training. Some believed that training to become a Sentinel or Guard was better than the servitude, but Sentinels and Guards had notoriously short lifespans. Most didn‚Äôt make it out of their mid-twenties, dying while hunting daimons‚Äîpures and halfs that had become addicted to aether‚Äîor from guarding the pures.  
  
¬† Becoming a Sentinel hadn‚Äôt meant that the halfs had free will. It just meant they had been chasing the lesser of two evils.  
  
¬† But the rule of the Breed Order was over and gone, just like the Elixir. Halfs had all the rights of the pures, and while many pures had fully supported the change, some were not overly thrilled that they no longer had access to free labor. And there were also halfs who weren‚Äôt ready to let thousands of years of injustice go.  
  
¬† Couldn‚Äôt really blame them for that.  
  
¬† Some of the halfs chose to continue training to become Sentinels. Some left their posts. Others stayed. And there were even some pures, much like the saintly Aiden St. Delphi, who had risen to the occasion and were now training to become Sentinels.  
  
¬† Chaos had a nasty habit of sneaking up on everyone when it was least expected, and although things had been quiet the last couple of days, I doubted it would remain that way.  
  
¬† In the cafeteria, Josie bypassed the grilled chicken and salad bar, bum-rushing the fried foods section. My kind of girl right there. She grabbed a basket of fries and I went for the fried chicken tenders. After loading up on drinks, we headed back to the dorm, and the whole time, Josie smiled in a way I began to worry might crack her face.  
  
¬† I eyed her as we headed down the narrow hall toward our rooms. ‚ÄúWhat are you smiling about?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she chirped, walking ahead of me.  
  
¬† Shifting the bottles under my arm, I found myself smiling when my gaze dropped to her heart-shaped ass. Damn. She made standard, Covenant-issued sweatpants something to dream about.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt seem like nothing,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSometimes I just like to smile for no reason.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSmiling gives you premature wrinkles.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd resting bitchface doesn‚Äôt. Yeah. I know.‚Äù Stopping in front of the door to her room, she glanced over at me. ‚ÄúOr maybe I‚Äôm just smiling because I like being around you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stared at her.  
  
¬† The corners of her lips tipped down. ‚ÄúToo much?‚Äù  
  
¬† Slowly, I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo. Never too much.‚Äù  
  
¬† That smile returned in full force. ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù She unlocked the door and said, ‚ÄúJust remember that.‚Äù  
  
¬† My brows rose as I followed her and then stopped in the middle of the doorway, my jaw unhinging as I stared into the room.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSurprise!‚Äù One‚Äîno, two or three voices shouted in unison, and I think I heard Josie giggle and say, ‚ÄúHappy birthday!‚Äù  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at all of the . . . balloons. Red. White. Yellow. Some were shaped like . . . penises? My gaze narrowed on a red one that was a good ten inches long with‚Äîyep‚Äîwith balls as the base. Penis balloons. My gaze tracked down, and there was Deacon St. Delphi, Aiden‚Äôs younger and definitely not as saintly brother, under the penis balloon, blond curls sticking out everywhere and silver eyes full of laughter.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awestruck, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù he said, smirking. ‚ÄúTold you, Luke. The balloons sealed the deal.‚Äù  
  
¬† Luke was leaning against the wall, ankles crossed. ‚ÄúI had nothing to do with the balloons.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was all me.‚Äù Jerking his thumb back at his chest, Deacon smiled proudly. ‚ÄúAll. Me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Josie placed the basket of fries on an end table next to a small loveseat in the sitting room area. Then she took my chicken tenders and the drinks, placing them next to the fries.  
  
¬† She smiled weakly. ‚ÄúI might‚Äôve, um, mentioned that you had a birthday coming up.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I murmured.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCake,‚Äù Deacon interjected, springing toward the coffee table. ‚ÄúWe got you a cake.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI also had nothing to do with the cake,‚Äù Luke announced, and when I looked at him, he shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty much just here to bear witness to your reaction.‚Äù  
  
¬† I had no words.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou have no idea what I had to do to get Libby to make this cake. By the way, Libby is one of our awesome cooks in the cafeteria,‚Äù Deacon explained. ‚ÄúAnd I think it‚Äôs a really awesome cake.‚Äù  
  
¬† At that moment, I looked at the cake, really looked at it, and my eyes widened. ‚ÄúSpider-Man?‚Äù  
  
¬† Josie dipped her chin, unsuccessfully hiding her grin.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou seemed like you‚Äôd be into Spider-Man.‚Äù  
  
¬† I opened my mouth. Yep. No words as I stared at the small, round cake. Libby should go into the cake-making business, I thought, because that was one hell of an accurate representation of Spider-Man, down to the blue tights and webbing.

1lmv52c,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lmv52c/my_birthgiver_stole_440000_from_my_father_and/,"My Birth-Giver stole ‚Ç¨440,000 from my father and portrays us as the bad children, whereas in our childhood she only beat, insulted and abandoned us. [Warning Childhood abuse, parental death, inheritance dispute]","My Birth-Giver was never a good mother. I cannot recall a single situation in my childhood where she was good to us (me, brother). She never spoke with us, never taught us anything, never did anything. During pregnancy, she regularly drank wine because it relaxed her. She once told this in a group after bragging about how well I was doing in school and how it ""clearly didn‚Äôt harm me."" Well, more on that later.

She never spent time with me or my brother. We always entertained ourselves. Because of this, both he and I started speaking late. In daycare, I was sent to an early-learning program for this reason, but I didn‚Äôt really learn to speak well there - instead, my passion for mathematics was awakened. When I started school, I had problems with reading and writing from second grade onward. My Birth-Giver was never interested in this. Studying together or reading a book for me or buying a book, anything like that, none of that existed with her. She put us in front of the television or sat there herself while my brother and I did whatever. This didn‚Äôt improve over the following years. I still managed to make friends at school, and we did many things together, which led to our parents becoming friendly too. A parent of my friends would also occasionally come over to our place to drink coffee and chat.

My father was magnificent. He bought the house with a mortgage and worked extremely hard to finance everything so we could live well. My Birth-Giver, in contrast, hadn‚Äôt worked for a long time before my birth and didn‚Äôt want to anymore. When he came home, he always ate dinner with us and put us to bed. I was always happy to see him. He also read to us a few times, but often he was truly exhausted. Because he had to work long hours, he had little time to notice how our Birth-Giver treated us.

On weekends, he sometimes played with us; when we could afford it, we occasionally went on trips, but these became rarer, especially after my Birth-Giver wanted a new expensive kitchen and a sports car.

My father then received an offer from his boss to work with him in a city 1.5 hours away for significantly higher pay, but also with higher taxes. He agreed, hoping it would improve our situation. He got a small studio apartment paid for by work, so he only came home on Friday evenings and left again early Monday.

Then, when I once brought home another bad grade in language arts (how could I have improved without help?), she slapped me violently across the face multiple times in front of one of my school friend‚Äôs mothers and pushed me against the wall. I ran upstairs to my room and locked myself in, but afterward, none of my friends wanted to play with me anymore, likely out of fear of the parents that my Birth-Giver might hit them too if they were near me. Because of this, I was very lonely from third grade through fourth grade. I practically have no memory of that time. Did nothing but sit in school, go home, go to my room, and watch television. When I once told my Birth-Giver that I wanted to learn karate, she just said I was too fat for sports and pushed me away before lying back down on the couch to continue watching TV.

My father couldn‚Äôt comprehend why the neighborhood was now avoiding us, also because my Birth-Giver fed him lies. He was completely overwhelmed by the situation and occasionally tried briefly to reach out to me and my brother, but we were closed off. He started working weekends too so we could take a big vacation trip and all get some rest. We went to the seaside, and it was truly a wonderful vacation. My father went swimming with me often, and we built great sandcastles. But at home, nothing changed.

At some point, she simply brought the big vacuum cleaner into my room with the command to vacuum the rooms. I had never used the thing before; it was big, loud, had many dials and buttons, and I didn‚Äôt know how to handle it. My brother and I were always yelled at and punished earlier when we wanted to try anything, like the sprinkler for watering, the garden awning, or the oven, because we did something wrong. Sometimes we were hit too. Very carefully, I plugged it in, pressed a few buttons, got scared, and then left it standing there. She came back later. Yelled at me and with one arm-sweep threw everything out of the cupboard, followed by the command to tidy everything back up without asking why I hadn‚Äôt done it.

Since my only good grade was in mathematics, I was sent to a school for weaker students starting in fifth grade. There, I got an incredibly good teacher. She saw what interested me and specifically encouraged me. She expanded my interest from mathematics to the natural sciences and first taught me that when you‚Äôre at home, you can open your book and notebook at home too to study on your own. Sounds crazy, but if no one teaches you how to learn, you don‚Äôt know how to do it. Because of this, I developed into the top student in my class within months and was allowed to return to a regular school after sixth grade. Because I read more about the solar system, electrical devices, animals, and such, my language skills also improved a lot. She was truly the best.

My Birth-Giver barely took care of the house herself anymore, and my father demanded that she find a job so he could be home more and help her with the household and the children. She then started working at a bakery, and my father was home more frequently. He often came to school, also to parent-teacher evenings, talked with my teacher, and because of this, took us to museums, tropical gardens, and zoos repeatedly, since I showed interest in these topics.

In fifth grade, finding new friends again, though due to the environment, these had their own problems. One tortured animals, and after I was once at his place and saw how he threw his little kitten against the wall multiple times, I just ran out and broke off contact. Another had violence problems and constantly attacked others. Because of this, I didn't get along well with him anymore either. The last one is still a good friend. He was simply addicted to video games and always gamed at home. We then simply always gamed together and had fun that way.

But because no one in the neighborhood wanted anything to do with my Birth-Giver anymore due to her behavior, she asked my father to move far away, to the seaside where we had vacationed. My father agreed because he also associated the place with a beautiful memory and the gossip in the neighborhood bothered him too.

Finally, when I was in seventh grade, we moved over a thousand kilometers away to the middle of nowhere. We were now in a 100-person village with new neighbors. My one friend, with whom I always gamed, I could simply game online with him, and we became closer friends during that time despite the distance. In school, I did even better, also because the teachers were all better in terms of content now. Unfortunately, as the new kid who came from far away, had a weird accent from another part of the country, and used words they didn‚Äôt know, I quickly became an outsider, and attempts to make friends also failed, which meant I was constantly bullied at school too. Only when a new kid joined in eighth grade who was severely overweight did he become the target of the class, and I had my peace.

I could then concentrate better on school and also completed tenth grade with very good grades, except in that one subject where the teacher demanded we discuss things in class, as I preferred to withdraw out of fear of becoming the target of attacks again.

My father had major difficulties during that time. He couldn‚Äôt find the work he used to do in the new area and only came to us one weekend a month, sleeping in the studio apartment. The stress wore him down, and he had his first heart attack quite early. He quit after that and decided to build something new.  
The exploratory phase was very hard for him, though, as he had imagined the move differently. Because he was now at home with us all the time, he witnessed our Birth-Giver‚Äôs tantrums against us, which certainly didn‚Äôt make it easier for him. He got her to stop with that, meaning the hitting and throwing objects stopped. She still screamed at us every now and then, though. My father could no longer share the bed with her because of this and only slept on the couch.

As a child, you don‚Äôt think much of it: ""Oh, Daddy fell asleep on the couch in front of the TV again,"" but in hindsight, it was clear. My father eventually built a small tourism business to manage all the new holiday homes built around our village and rent them out to holiday guests for the owners. Financially, things got worse for us than before moving because of this, and he asked my Birth-Giver to find work too, which she then did. She worked as a cleaner in a hotel and found friends there, while my father practically spent every minute trying to earn enough money through the business to pay all the bills.

My brother suffered the most in the new environment. He didn‚Äôt have the luck like me to get a great teacher and remained poor in school like I was back then. I did try to help him, but he probably wanted to fool around more, likely out of nostalgia from earlier childhood. But I hadn‚Äôt experienced much joy from direct interaction for years and wanted to focus on teaching him, which is why it never lasted longer than 10 minutes before I went back to my room out of frustration at his lack of motivation. My brother dropped out of school and joined a special practical training program where he was introduced to various simple jobs to find out what he liked.

I moved out at 16, partly forced. Due to my current school commute, I couldn‚Äôt simply attend the higher grades and had to go to a special school that enabled me to get the higher school leaving certificate. Applying to the school, housing, and forms ‚Äì I had to fill everything out myself and make the calls myself. My Birth-Giver had no interest in what was happening with us at school. She never did. My father at that time had enough on his plate with work and was only occupied with paying bills, and didn‚Äôt know how to deal with the family anymore.

At the new school and in a dormitory for minors, I finally blossomed. New friends, new environment, developed a new independence, and tried things out. After just a few weeks, I went home less and less often and preferred to stay in the dorm.

My father tried one last time to bring us together, and we took a very small vacation in the middle of nowhere and also visited my Birth-Giver‚Äôs family again. My Birth-Giver didn‚Äôt really have anything great to say, so she just bragged about how great I was, while my brother‚Äôs path was completely ignored, which didn‚Äôt do him any good. That‚Äôs also when she told them she drank wine during pregnancy. Overall, I was just bored by the whole thing, probably a teenager thing, but I also really had almost no family relationship with anyone there anymore. I just wanted to go back to my dorm and my friends.

I came home less often and eventually found out that my Birth-Giver was apparently running around the village sleeping with various men and having affairs. At a village festival, she apparently hooked up with another man while my father, exhausted from 80-hour weeks, just wanted a break from everything.  
My brother eventually started helping out in my father‚Äôs business, and the two were able to build a very close relationship, while my Birth-Giver ruined her reputation again in the new neighborhood and hardly anyone wanted anything to do with her. When I visited, she mostly sat in the kitchen with a beer and bragged about what a good boy I had become.

Through the independence I gained in the new environment, I also made doctor‚Äôs appointments, including with an orthodontist for braces. For one appointment, a parent had to be present, and because my father had enough to do, she had to come. She apparently wasn‚Äôt even in the village anymore but near her hometown with her brother, my Nazi uncle, who is known for getting together with women, relieving them of their money, and then disappearing. When she was there, my orthodontist really tore her apart because something should have been done for me years ago and it‚Äôs more difficult with (almost) adults.

She left after signing and was gone again before I could say goodbye. Since money was tight, I worked a job alongside school, yet still completed the higher school leaving certificate as the top student in my school and was able to study. Thanks to my brother, my father now had a bit more flexibility and could also come to my graduation ceremony. He was proud of me, and after a long time, we finally had a real father-son conversation again. He still had a lot of stress, but my brother would likely be able to take over the business and thus have a secure future, which reassured him greatly. My Birth-Giver apparently moved in with one of her affairs, but they didn‚Äôt get divorced.¬†

My father was worried that the business, all its office equipment and storage being part of our house, would all be lost and my brother would have nothing without a school leaving certificate or vocational training, but after he made it clear to her how large the widow‚Äôs pension would be and that she would inherit everything when he died, she agreed to it. She is just like my uncle, her brother.

During my studies, I then only came home for the holidays, and my father, my brother, and I were able to grow closer as a family again, now that my Birth-Giver was finally gone. During my studies, I also got together with my first real girlfriend, and we were a couple throughout the entire bachelor's degree. In the end, though, there were already the first cracks due to diverging lives, and we broke up. The breakup was really hard for me because she was the only person in my life I had truly loved. The pain paralyzed me, and I decided to move away for my master‚Äôs program.

The pain didn‚Äôt go away, though, and I practically lost a year because I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on my studies. When I then started making new contacts in the new city, Corona came and everything collapsed. I fell into a hole and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I moved in with my father and my brother after a few months, helped out with the business, and decided to continue studying when proper on-site studies were possible again. This brought the three of us closer. I hadn‚Äôt seen my Birth-Giver there for years and was glad about it. We also went through old stuff, looked at many pictures. When asked why there were so many baby photos of me but not of my brother, my father told us that apparently our Birth-Giver started burning his pictures because of the disappointment he was to her. In general, he then told us more about what had happened, and neighbors and my brother confirmed it.

Finally, Corona ended, and I studied normally in my master‚Äôs for 1 year. It was hard to get back into it, but it worked. My father finally planned to fulfill an old dream and booked a trip for himself for several weeks. He made many preparations, including for the motorcycle riding that he and my brother had found as their hobby; he planned to take his motorcycle along. My brother could already run the business well alone. But then, in late autumn, just a few months before his dream trip, I got a message from my brother: My father is dead on the couch. Heart attack, during the night. My brother contacted all the customers the same day, explained the situation, and took care of the most urgent tasks. My Birth-Giver apparently found out and was there the next day.

I really wanted to vomit on the spot. I endured it. Our father had a handwritten will in his office drawer stating he wanted to leave everything to us, which wouldn't help much because according to marital property law, she already owned half of everything anyway, but it was something at least. My brother drove away after seeing her, and I followed. Unfortunately, she was then alone in the house. When we came back, she was in the kitchen cooking food, just saying that she wanted to be there for us now. My brother was just annoyed by everything and went up to his room. She declared she wanted to take care of all the funeral arrangements and pay for everything. That same evening, she already mentioned that we could sell the house. I told her I really had no nerves for that right now. I had already considered throwing her out, but she is still registered at this house. And it belongs to her by half.

I let her sleep in the guest room but didn‚Äôt eat anything she cooked. I really didn‚Äôt want to. She did indeed take care of all the funeral stuff, as she said, and paid for it too. My brother was not coping well with the situation at all. He blames himself for the death because he woke up during the night but didn‚Äôt go downstairs to check. Our father was his best friend. They did everything together. I kept the business running for two weeks and had already applied for my brother to take over the company, but he then said he didn‚Äôt want any of it anymore and wanted to do something else. So, business dissolved and somehow held my brother together. After the funeral, it was about the inheritance matters. I searched the entire office but still couldn‚Äôt find the will. Nothing. Also nothing in the rest of the house. I asked my brother; he also said it should be in the office. Long story short: It never turned up.

For the next 1.5 years, it went like this: I helped my brother find a job while my Birth-Giver came by with her lover every now and then to talk about selling the house. She threatened with auction if we didn‚Äôt agree; I just said ""go ahead,"" knowing the property would then be sold way below market value, and left again.

I managed to find an apprenticeship for my brother, and he gradually got better. We had a small section of the house that was rented out to holiday guests in the past, but since that stopped with the business, he moved in there and left the main house alone. We sold a few things from the business for money for everyday things and utilities, but also for tax arrears for the dissolved business. Our Birth-Giver immediately said she wanted to completely take over the mortgage, insurance, and taxes, which we let her do. She can gladly pay the ‚Ç¨700 monthly, which is less than half of her widow's pension. As a student, I don‚Äôt have the money, my unemployed brother certainly doesn‚Äôt, and after 25 years of not paying anything, she can finally make her contribution.

Then I decided to finally finish my studies. So, started my master‚Äôs thesis. 4 months later, my brother calls me saying he can‚Äôt take it anymore. Everything reminds him of our father. He also said our Birth-Giver was there and she wants to sell the house, and everyone should get a third. I, having no desire for any of this anymore, agreed. Called her, and she confirmed it. So, he found an apartment and left the house. A buyer was found quickly too.

This week, the notary appointment; 1/3 each after deducting all costs and mortgage settlement was in the contract, all good. As the notary reads that part aloud, my Birth-Giver suddenly changes her mind. ""I don‚Äôt want it like this."" I say that you promised that, and we start arguing. The buyers just said that one shouldn‚Äôt be so greedy and that family shouldn‚Äôt fight over money. I got louder; the notary sends the buyers out of the room for a moment. We argue there for a while, and my Birth-Giver mimics me with a grimace: ""A third. A third. Uhhh. I don‚Äôt remember that."" My brother, who just wants to leave it all behind, already said: ""I‚Äôll give you my share if you want.""

I just got angrier, saying you should get your share too. Then the notary also said that 1/8 of the inheritanceis still a lot, and I could only think about how this malicious, greedy, filthy snake was pulling this off and said I would only sign if 1/4 was written there for me and demanded the same for my brother. He declined and just wants to get it over with. In the end, SHE now gets, who did NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, 5/8 of our father‚Äôs assets, who literally worked himself to death. I simply can‚Äôt believe it. I was already about to get up and just leave when she mocked me again. But my brother just held me and said we should finally finish this.

Well, she walked down the stairs laughing, and I already wanted to follow her and k\*\*\* her on the spot, really, that‚Äôs how angry I was. I drove home, slept, and today I feel even angrier. I should have left. I should have just left. This filthy snake.

We stayed at the Fairmont El San Juan for our entire trip, in one of their Oceanside Villas. The grounds are beautiful, great pools, beachfront access on Isla Verde, and very friendly staff.

That said, I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôd stay there again. It was very expensive, and unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt feel the value matched the price. A few issues:

Our ‚ÄúOceanside Villa‚Äù was directly in front of a pool‚Äînot the private, quiet vibe we expected.

The bathtub (a major reason we booked this room) didn‚Äôt work. The drain wouldn‚Äôt seal, and despite reporting it, it wasn‚Äôt fixed during our stay.

On-site restaurants were excellent, especially the breakfast buffet, but pricey.

Parking wasn‚Äôt included: $27/day to self-park, or $35+tip for valet. And the self-parking lot filled up on weekends, leaving us stuck with valet anyway.

In hindsight, we‚Äôd probably opt for an Airbnb next time. It would‚Äôve been nice to have laundry, a kitchen, and a more private, relaxed vibe.

**Rental Car**

We rented a compact car from Enterprise at the airport. Highly recommend going with a smaller vehicle, it made navigating tight streets and parking in Old San Juan much easier.

**Old San Juan**

We went to Old San Juan a couple of times and loved it. Some sightseeing highlights:

Castillo San Felipe del Morro, Paseo de la Princesa, and Parque de las Palomas, beautiful and walkable areas with lots of photo ops.

Tried the ""original"" pi√±a colada at Barrachina.  Cool experience, but honestly not our favorite pi√±a colada on the island.

Souvenir shopping: We visited Puerto Rican Arts & Crafts and The Handcraft Store. The latter was amazing, the older lady running it was the sweetest person we met on the trip, giving us a full tour of local artist goods and even a hug when we left.

We parked in the Do√±a Felisa Rinc√≥n de Gautier Parking Garage each time, super convenient and safe.

For our anniversary dinner, we splurged on Marmalade. We don‚Äôt usually do fine dining, but this place blew us away. Incredible service, next-level food (the white bean soup deserves the hype), and a thoughtful anniversary card signed by the entire staff. They were also super accommodating with my wife‚Äôs gluten allergy. Worth every penny.

**Culebra Snorkeling & Flamenco Beach**

We booked the Culebra Snorkeling and Beach Tour through East Island Excursions (from Fajardo).

Morning catamaran to Culebra (~1 hour)

First stop: Tamarindo Beach for snorkeling.  Tons of fish, coral, and sea turtles!

Second stop: Flamenco Beach, easily the most stunning beach we've ever seen.

Lunch: build-your-own sandwiches, salads, fresh fruit, and all you can drink cocktails.

The crew was fantastic!  Fun, friendly, and kept the vibes high. Absolutely recommend if you want a quick and easy way to experience Culebra and Flamenco.

**Beach Horseback Riding ‚Äì Carabal√≠ Rainforest Park**

We did the 2.5-hour horseback ride from Carabal√≠ Rainforest Park out to Playa Fortuna, near Luquillo.

Neither of us had ever ridden horses, but it was beginner-friendly and relaxing.

Beautiful trail ride that ends at a beachfront bar (Carabal√≠ Beach House) with affordable drinks and food.

Guides were great, they even used our phones to take tons of pics for us.

If you‚Äôre looking for something unique and low-stress, definitely give this a try.

**Coffee Farm Tour ‚Äì Hacienda Mu√±oz**

We toured Hacienda Mu√±oz, since the more famous coffee plantations are on the west side and harder to reach.

Gorgeous grounds and an educational tour.

Excellent coffee. We grabbed a bag to bring home.

Great option if you‚Äôre based on the east side or near San Juan and want a taste of the local coffee scene without a long drive.

**El Yunque & Luquillo Kiosks**

We did El Yunque without a tour and had no issues. Here's our route:

Drove straight to Mount Britton Trailhead early in the morning

Hiked to Torre Britton, then continued on to El Yunque Peak

Total hike time: ~2.5 hours roundtrip

Fairly strenuous, bring water, snacks, and good shoes

View from Torre Britton was amazing, but El Yunque Peak was totally in the clouds (still a cool experience!)

After the hike:

Quick stop at Juan Diego Falls and the visitor center

Then hit the Luquillo kiosks.  Such a fun vibe and so much amazing food (perfect post-hike meal!)

You could easily spend two days exploring different parts of the forest if you‚Äôre into hiking and waterfalls.

**Ziplining at Toro Verde**

We ended the trip with a visit to Toro Verde Adventure Park in Orocovis.

The drive was scenic and a bit twisty, but totally worth it.

We did the Couples Pass (~$200 total): 7 traditional ziplines + The Monster

The Monster was insane, longest zipline in the Americas, flying superman-style over the mountains. Honestly felt like soaring.

Bit of a wait and climb at the tower, but the adrenaline rush was unforgettable.

**Final Thoughts**

Puerto Rico was the perfect mix of adventure, culture, and relaxation for our honeymoon.
One thing that really stood out to us was the people of Puerto Rico, some of the friendliest and warmest we've ever met. Their positive energy and fun vibes were absolutely infectious and added so much to the experience.

We‚Äôll definitely be coming back.  Next time, we‚Äôre thinking of staying on the west side of the island, maybe Rinc√≥n, in a cozy Airbnb for something a bit more laid back and low key.

Big thanks again to this sub for all the advice that helped us plan such a memorable trip. Happy to answer questions or provide more details if anyone‚Äôs curious!",5,1751138413.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,1.0,False

1lmuzku,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lmuzku/my_new_job_rules/,"My new Job, rules","When I started working the graveyard shift at the local convenience store, I was just looking for a paycheck. But they didn‚Äôt hand me a uniform first. They handed me a list of rules.

No one explained them. My manager just said:
‚ÄúFollow these. Don‚Äôt ask questions. If you screw up, you‚Äôll know why.‚Äù
He smiled like he was joking, but his eyes weren‚Äôt laughing.

Here‚Äôs the list. I keep a copy in my back pocket. If you're ever unlucky enough to cover a night shift here, you'll want to do the same.

Rule One: The Man in the Black Suit
If a man in a black suit enters at 1:34 AM, and you cannot make out his face‚Äîeven if nothing is covering it‚Äîgo into the back room and lock the door.

Don‚Äôt come out until you hear the doorbell chime again.

Don‚Äôt try to peek.
Don‚Äôt try to take a picture.
Just wait.

Rule Two: The Red Slurpee
If the Slurpee machine starts dispensing a dark red mixture, stop everything.

Hang an ‚ÄúOut of Order‚Äù sign on the entire machine‚Äînot just the red nozzle.

Get the red-labeled bucket from under the sink (marked ‚ÄúRed Slurpee‚Äù).

Cycle the machine into the bucket until it returns to a normal color.

Keep cycling for two full buckets afterward, just to be safe.

If anyone drinks the dark red Slurpee:

Offer them anything to keep them in the store.

Remain calm.

Use the black phone in the back room.

Dial 10711 followed by the store number (for example: 1072110798).

Say: ""Red Slurpee.""

Then follow every single instruction they give you.

Rule Three: Trash Time
Never take out the trash between 1:30 AM and 3:45 AM.
I tell the new hires 2 to 4 AM, just to be safe.

Rule Four: The CDC Guy
If someone from the CDC shows up with no paperwork, and it's not Sunday, tell him you don‚Äôt want the delivery.

It‚Äôs not milk.
It‚Äôs not donuts.
It‚Äôs not sandwiches.
It‚Äôs not safe.

Rule Five: The Little Girl
Sometimes a little girl shows up alone, usually quiet.

Let her pick what candy she wants.
Do not charge her.

There‚Äôs petty cash in the drawer under Register One.
Print a receipt, sign it, and place it in the box beside the cash.

Don‚Äôt tell the manager.
They already know.
They never talk about her during the day.

Rule Six: The Vault
Restock the walk-in beverage cooler whenever needed. But remember:

Items are never in the same place twice.

If you need to exit, only leave through the same door you entered.

If you exit a different door, go back in, then leave through the original entrance.

Never take anything with you if you used the wrong door.

Ignore any voices or people on the other side.

They are not customers.
They are not safe.

Rule Seven: The Emergency Outside
If someone runs in screaming for help and begs you to go outside with them:

Do not go.

Tell them you‚Äôll call the police.
If they insist, go into the back and use the black phone again.

Dial 10712 plus your store number.

Say: ""Emergency Outside.""

Follow instructions.

When you hang up, do not return to the front of the store until the black phone rings.

Answer it. The voice will say a code phrase.

For this store, it‚Äôs:

‚ÄúBreakfast Bite, Potato Split Top Bun.‚Äù

That‚Äôs your sign it‚Äôs safe again.
Don‚Äôt answer any other phones.

Rule Eight: The Coffee
7-Eleven always keeps coffee fresh.

Back when we had glass pots, it was every 15 minutes. Now it‚Äôs 3 hours max with the new system.

If you have the instant brewer:
Never let it run out of beans.

You don‚Äôt want to know what happens if it does.

Rule Nine: Pump 1
At exactly 3:33 AM, if a man comes in asking for $6.65 on Pump 1, and gives you a $100 bill:

Take it.

Place the change and signed receipt into the box under Register One.

This helps fund the little girl‚Äôs candy.

Don‚Äôt ask questions. Just do it.

Rule Ten: The Money
There‚Äôs a reason we‚Äôre picky about money handling.

If someone asks you to load a card over the phone, hang up.

If a customer tells you to keep a tip, you may keep it.

If someone leaves change and says nothing, print a receipt, sign it, and put it under Register Two.

If you find money that shouldn‚Äôt be there, and you haven‚Äôt had a customer in a while, put it in the Register Two box with a note:

Amount

Register time (not the wall clock)

The manager will handle it.

He always does.

That‚Äôs the list.
I‚Äôve followed every rule.
Some of my coworkers didn‚Äôt.

They don‚Äôt work here anymore.

Hell‚Ä¶ some of them probably aren‚Äôt anywhere anymore.

If you get the night shift, don‚Äôt screw around.
Don‚Äôt play hero.
Don‚Äôt test it.

Just follow the rules.

And whatever you do‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt drink the red Slurpee.

I‚Äôm planning to open a small bistro in a town in Hungary with around 90,000 people. The concept is focused on breakfast and lunch menus, with both dine-in and takeaway options. The location is pretty solid ‚Äì high foot traffic near schools, offices, and a busy bus stop.

The idea is to offer:

Quick but quality breakfast (coffee, donuts, breakfast buns/sandwiches, fresh juices, lemonade)

Simple lunch options (burgers, fries, daily specials, etc.)

I would really appreciate your input on a few things:


Realistic revenue expectations ‚Äì What kind of daily or monthly revenue is typical or achievable in the first few months, assuming a decent launch?

Lessons learned ‚Äì Have you opened something similar in a small or mid-sized town? What were the biggest mistakes or challenges you faced?

Tips that helped you ‚Äì Any specific menu items, workflows, or marketing tricks that worked really well for you?


If you‚Äôre comfortable sharing actual numbers (average sales, costs, margins, etc.), that would be amazing ‚Äì but even general advice or anecdotes are super helpful. Just trying to build a realistic plan before I commit everything.

I have 2 SKs, SS10 and SD9. We get along relatively well and have them 50/50. 

First off I had a traumatic birth and also ended up having to be readmitted to the hospital a week after birth due to a uterine infection. Me and baby both almost died and I was forced to be away from her for 3 days in the hospital. Of course when DH asked BM if she could keep the kids a few extra days because I was in the hospital, she said that‚Äôs too bad, figure it out. 

So 24 hrs after coming home from giving birth I had to deal with SKs as well as immediately after being discharged from the hospital the second time. DH did the best he could and was there for me but we have no family support nearby so our only option was BM. 

So understandably I‚Äôve been feeling super overwhelmed and protective of my new baby. I am trying to be as easygoing as possible but after knowing how close I came to losing her I feel very anxious about taking any risks. 

SKs have been horrible about following my rules, which are just to wash their hands, and change their shirt when they come home from school before trying to touch the baby. They‚Äôve repeatedly lied about washing their hands, refuse to wash them after using the bathroom (even #2), and lie about showering. They also have tried to touch her face and coughed in her face after being told under no circumstances are they allowed to do that because they could get their baby sister very sick. 

Not to mention BM has cold sores and sends these kids here sick all the time.

Then the other day, SS10 comes home and sits next to me and the baby and asks ‚ÄúHow long do babies have soft spots on their heads for?‚Äù Ummm about a year? ‚ÄúOkay, cause sometimes I get these intrusive thoughts about squeezing them really hard.‚Äù *creepy smirk at me* ummm WTF??? 

He went upstairs and I didn‚Äôt really get a chance to address it but of course DH says ‚Äúhe was just joking.‚Äù Like I get it kids say wild shit but who knows if he meant it or not? Especially when this kid has gotten into fights at school before? All he cares about is call of duty and going shooting so forgive me if I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the perfect angel who isn‚Äôt capable of violence, whether it‚Äôs intentional or not. 

DH also changed baby‚Äôs diaper in front of SS10 and I‚Äôm feeling really uncomfortable about that too. Cause he got in trouble a few months ago for recording a video of his little sister (SD9) naked in the shower. ‚ÄúAs a joke.‚Äù Am I wrong that I feel like our daughter also deserves privacy? Even though she‚Äôs a baby I don‚Äôt really want SS seeing her naked, like it just makes me feel really weird. 

Then today I ask DH to take the baby so I can shower, and he goes outside with SS and puts baby in her bouncer. Then he goes inside twice to get coffee and left her outside with SS. Mind you, it was only for a few minutes, but am I wrong for freaking out about that? Especially after what he said about her? 

Even if he would never hurt her intentionally, I feel like all it takes is one second where he shakes her as a joke or something dumb or kisses her when no one is looking. Now I feel like I have to be hyper vigilant when they‚Äôre here and just want to hide in my bedroom with baby until their POS mom picks them up. 

Ugh. Being a first time mom and having SKs is not for the weak y‚Äôall. Send help",0,1751137801.0,Stepmom,4,0.5,False

1lmups7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1lmups7/explore_best_ice_maker_features_in_silonn/,Explore Best Ice Maker Features in Silonn SLIM25B-US?,"There‚Äôs something incredibly satisfying about pulling out a tray of perfectly formed ice cubes, especially after a long, sweaty summer day. That‚Äôs exactly why I gave the Silonn SLIM25B-US a try. This countertop ice machine was practically begging to be a fixture in my chaotic kitchen‚Äîplaced between the blender that gets way too much use and the coffee maker that never gets a break. With promises of 9 cubes in 6 minutes, quiet operation, portability, and a self-cleaning feature, I figured it deserved more than just a glance.

**Compact Design with Portable Charm**

My expectations were modest at first. Ice makers tend to be bulky space-hogs that belong in commercial settings, but this one surprised me right out of the box. It‚Äôs remarkably compact‚Äîjust under 12 inches long and 10 inches high‚Äîwithout sacrificing capacity. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a cheap plastic toy, either. The matte black-transparent color gives it a modern, minimalist touch, and the flip-up handle is a smart addition for mobility. I actually hauled it over to my neighbor‚Äôs backyard BBQ (yep, handheld like a mini cooler), and it was a hit‚Äîno one believed something so small could keep up.

**Fast Ice Production that Delivers (Mostly)**

The bullet-style cubes look adorable, and they chill drinks quickly. I typically run it just before my kids come home from soccer practice, and sure enough: less than 10 minutes in, the first round of ice is ready. I tried both the small and large ice size options. The smaller ones are perfect for blended drinks or iced coffees, and the larger ones are ideal for cocktails or whiskey. While it promises 9 cubes every 6 minutes, I found it sometimes hits more of a 7-8 minute cadence after a full hour of running continuously. Still, that‚Äôs better than waiting for trays to freeze.

[Don‚Äôt miss Silonn SLIM25B-US deals‚Äîcheck Amazon here.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0d95wgnyv/)

**Smart Features Make Life Easier**

One unexpected benefit was the alert system‚Äîan LED indicator tells you when the reservoir needs more water or the ice basket is full. No guesswork involved. I left it running unattended during a virtual meeting (because, of course, everything breaks during Zoom) and it quietly did its job without issue. The interface is barebones but functional. A few touch buttons, a couple of lights, and zero messy menus. Even my tech-averse mother-in-law figured it out in under a minute.

**Self-Cleaning‚ÄîGimmick or Game-changer?**

I underestimated just how useful the self-cleaning function would be. After a long weekend of using it nonstop for blended daiquiris and soda on ice, I ran the cleaning mode with a splash of vinegar and water. The manual says press the Select button, hold it, and then press On/Off to start a five-minute cycle. After draining over a sink, it genuinely did feel cleaner. It‚Äôs not industrial-grade sanitation, but it keeps the machine from smelling funky or getting build-up‚Äîjust makes maintenance easier in the long run.

**Highlights**

- Creates ice in under 10 minutes‚Äîeven with continuous use.
- Offers two bullet-shaped ice sizes for different needs.
- Lightweight build with handle makes it easily portable.
- Operates quietly at ~45 dB‚Äîless noisy than expected.
- Self-cleaning function simplifies upkeep and keeps ice fresh.

**Shortcomings**

- No freezer compartment‚Äîice melts if not used quickly.
- Ice basket isn‚Äôt insulated, so it acts more like a temporary holder.
- Doesn‚Äôt always meet the 9 cube/6-minute promise under stress.
- Slightly inconsistent shape and clarity of ice depending on water used.

**Product Rivals**

Compared to models like the Frigidaire EFIC103 and the GE Profile Opal 2.0, this one trades frills for functionality. The Opal 2.0 makes pellet ice and has Alexa integration, but it also costs significantly more and takes up extra counter space. Frigidaire‚Äôs EFIC103, which I tested for a weekend at my cousin‚Äôs lake cabin, produced slightly clearer ice but operated with a loud fan and didn't include a self-cleaning cycle. What the Silonn product lacks in high-end sophistication, it makes up for with portability and easy interface. For someone prioritizing simplicity over tech-enhanced extras, this one hits a nice balance.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

If we‚Äôre talking bang for your buck? It holds its own solidly. You‚Äôre getting a compact ice-making workhorse with smart touches (alerts, ice-size choices, self-cleaning) without tacking on unnecessary costs for features you might never use. It‚Äôs cheaper than the GE Opal line, yet delivers more consistent results than some off-brand machines I‚Äôve tried from big-box stores. It doesn't scream luxury, but it definitely punches above its price tag weight class.

I am sorry this is a bit long, but I need to get it off my chest and know if AITAH.  
I‚Äôd really appreciate some outside perspective.

I work in a project-based tech corporate environment which is very male dominated. Almost two years ago, I became close friends with a colleague - let‚Äôs call him Matt. It was never romantic or sexual (we were both clear about that and I definitely didn't find him attractive - he found himself very attractive though which is a turn off for me lol), but it¬†*was*¬†emotionally intense at times. He has a girlfriend, and I‚Äôm in a healthy relationship now, so I was always firm about keeping boundaries in place. We got close real fast and it was a good friendship, but maybe a bit onesided. He'd sometimes ask if I wanted to pick him up and drive him to work. I'd agree sometimes because his mental health sometimes kept him from going out the door and I knew I was helping him even though I normally walk to work because I live so close. He'd buy me breakfast and coffee in return.

Over time, though, I started noticing red flags both in our conversations and in how he acted in general. He would often:

* Talk about other women at work in an objectifying way (while in a committed relationship). Which I told him was wrong in so many ways.
* Flirt with a new colleague to the point where he planned a date,¬†*without disclosing he had a girlfriend*. I and other co-workers had to call him out on it. He was clearly frustrated at himself, but I have no idea how he couldn't just keep professional.
* React defensively or minimize when I shared something personal (like my trauma, PTSD diagnosis, and emotional abuse).
* Frequently derail discussions about sexual assault to center how¬†*men*¬†‚Äúhave it hard too‚Äù. (Which I acknowledge, but it's an entirely different discussion)
* Dismiss scientific studies that challenged his worldview - particularly when women were shown in a positive light.

We had a lot of good debates through texts about everything and it was so nice to have someone to debate with, but he showed a pattern of becoming degrading and make personal attacks (ad hominem) and use gaslighting. I would point this out, and tell him I was not gonna take part in that, partly because I despise it, and it is not a good way to maintain a good friendship, but also partly because it would trigger my PTSD. I said this to him openly and kindly every time he would exhibit that type of behaviour, and let him know that if he went there in the future I'd just stop replying. He'd always make one last snark remark and I would end up not replying as promised. Which he interpreted as he won the debate and start referring to me as a sore loser.¬†

Despite all this, I kept trying to maintain a cordial connection, especially since we work closely. But a few weeks ago, after a particularly condescending conversation where he implied I ‚Äúlacked comprehension‚Äù and needed to ‚Äúre-read to understand him,‚Äù I finally said I needed space and blocked him on our private chats with a fair warning letting him know it was just for a few days.

The last time was too much for me. We didn't even have a debate. I sent a reel about how men and women differ in stressful situations (amongst many other reels) and he chose to reply to that one with a wave of condescending messages. The messages are in my native language, but here is a translation:

Him: Very simplified, but yes.  
Him: Remember the nuances.  
Him: Classic confirmation bias. Thought you got smarter with age and not more stupid. Fun to look at (smirk smiley)  
Me: What are you assuming here?  
Him: Not assuming anything. Have seen it time and time again. You are and will forever be a lost cause (nerd smiley). I give up  
Me: What is this based on?  
Him: Wow memory loss, ignorance, etc. impressive. Our previous debates (shrug emoji) you lose and everything is a misunderstanding (rofl) Dinosaur, AI, disposable income for living.. I can go on and on (rofl) No critical thinking, no abilities to read sources (the source you referred to said nothing of what you said). Some times you don't even know what you are referring to if it is foreign or not (rofl) You point out own experiences and abilities, but have nothing and do not use any theory, no sources and has in general just a lack of ability to search and refer to relevant sources (rofl)  
Him: My view of you has definitely changed (rofl)  
Me: So you just - out of the blue - felt like you wanted to say these things even though we concluded you can't use arguments such as the debates about dinosaur and AI, because we definitely just disagree and we both found sources and cited theory? You can't use the debate about disposable income and cost of living because it's a question of remembering two very different things. I am convinced that you remember wrong about what I said at lunch and vice versa. All these arguments are unusable and we have already concluded that together and now you bring them up again out of the blue. So I ask again, what is it that you assume here and what are you basing your comments on?  
Him: Right, just sweep it away. You think I can't use it, but reread and you will understand (shaking head emoji) It is a pattern and it is obvious now.  
Me: You constantly choose to communicate in a degrading, condescending and unpleasant way, and even after I have set boundaries several times you continue. It is wearing me down and that is why I gradually withdraw as I have told you several times before. I do not wish to part take in conversations or debates, where the goal is to push buttons for the purpose of feeling bigger, and sadly that is the pattern you are exhibiting repeatedly. When you time and time again attempt to humiliate me, despite me setting clear and healthy boundaries about exactly this behaviour it makes me doubt if you actually want to be friends. Real friends respect each others' boundaries and doesn't hide behind ""it was just for good fun"" or ""I was just joking with you"". I've said stop so many times now. Since you found out that my IQ and other tests showed my intelligence were higher than yours it seems like your need to pull me down has increased. I just don't understand why you can't rest in yourself and be happy for yourself for being a very intelligent person yourself. You are! This is not a competition and I am not gonna take part in a competition you have made up without my consent. I am putting a pause on our text communication a few days. I have said stop several times, and it is clearly not being respected.

I then continued to block him for 1 day on the two social media platforms we use to communicate. He still has my number, though.  
He removed me as a friend on facebook, and then added me back and then removed the request.

That‚Äôs when his¬†**workplace behaviour changed drastically**.

# Since then:

* He‚Äôs stopped saying hello in the mornings (even when I greet him first). Not even looking my way.
* He‚Äôs begun entering the office through a¬†*different*, inconvenient entrance - one that forces him to walk directly past my desk. (he doesn't leave through that entrance though)
* He removed himself from all our shared social/team chats on Teams.
* He cancelled his spot at an inter-office lunch I organised.
* He pulled out of a small ‚Äúcelebration‚Äù event we had planned for me finishing a major personal milestone - something¬†*he*¬†initially offered to help organise.
* He ghosted our summer party with a vague message about ‚Äútalking to banks about housing.‚Äù (on a friday night?)

Colleagues have noticed his shift in behaviour - one even mentioned he seems colder and more distant lately (not just towards me).

I‚Äôm now stuck between wanting to move on and feeling genuinely uncomfortable. I‚Äôm worried this could escalate or hurt my reputation professionally. I‚Äôve kept a journal of his behavior and gathered some of the messages he‚Äôs sent me over time in case I need to go to HR or my manager (on the recommendation from another female co-worker). I really don't hope I will need to.

Don‚Äôt tell me to sit in silence
if you don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like
to hear the sound of your own thoughts
screaming louder than a car crash at midnight.

This isn't noise to me.
It‚Äôs not a luxury or a crutch.
It‚Äôs how I‚Äôve survived
a world that taught me
not to feel too much.

When I was four, I danced barefoot
on the coffee table while my grandfather clapped,
singing like it might save me.
And it did.

When my chest caved in
and no one noticed,
Skillet held me like a heartbeat
in my mother‚Äôs lap.

Every verse is a hand I held
when no one reached back.
Every chorus is a breath
I remembered to take.

I don‚Äôt listen to music.
I bleed into it.
I breathe through it.
I become it.

So don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs just sound.
Don‚Äôt tell me to function without it
like you‚Äôre asking me to function
without skin.

Because when the music stops,
the ghosts don‚Äôt leave.
The noise just shifts inward.
And I....I start to drown.

So yes, maybe I‚Äôm dependent.
Maybe it is my drug.
But at least it‚Äôs one that‚Äôs never left me,
never hurt me,
never told me I was too much.

We have two sons, each well married, each have two sons.  I have actively grieved through therapist support from the Veterans Administration, Grief Share through the church, and discussion with peer widowers.  Grief ambushes are down to every two weeks or so. Rural area of the Missouri Ozarks.

 I am very active physically.  Yoga, pickleball, swimming, jogging, and some weight lifting.  Therein lies my question.  Widows from my high school class are not physically active at all.  We had a planning session for our 60th high school reunion recently.  I was the only male.  One lady still has her husband, but the others are widowed.  

I am lonely and meet single women in my activities.  These ladies are generally in their fifties.  I am 77.  I have been out with the groups for coffee, or a drink.  And have had dinner a few times with one widow.  It seems so unfair for me aspire to a relationship that is compatible physically and interests/activity wise yet very likely to leave her widowed a second time.  

I have discussed this with a friend and she advised me that age fifty women are capable of making a decision on age gap relationships.  My friend thinks I should continue to explore the opportunities for a long term relationship regardless of age.  Obviously I may find that fifty years old active single women are happy to have a friend, but not interested at all in a romantic relationship.

Meanwhile there is sure to be an active healthy 70 years old lady in a similar situation.  Perhaps we will meet on the mat, the court, the pool, the 5K.  I chat up all the new ladies just in case there‚Äôs a spark and appropriate age.

This was a story of my brother back when he was just 12 years old. He's now 33 and currently working in Japan. Nung time na andito pa sya sa Pinas, ayaw na ayaw nyang napapag-usapan namin ito sa loob ng bahay. Nagagalit sya. He said he's having some vivid flashbacks of what it looks like from years ago. Like it was some kind of trauma for him at ayaw nyang maalala. 

I have 3 older brothers and this brother of mine is our 2nd born. He have this ""gift"" of seeing things that normal people wouldn't see.

Once lang nakwento ng brother ko yung nangyari at nakita nya sa parents namin and never nang naulit pa, kaya yung parents namin ang nagkwento samin.

So eto na nga, we are from Batangas and we have this certain place in our town and we call it ""agbang"". Para syang bangin na dinadaanan ng tubig pag malakas ang ulan. Madaming puno like tall bamboos, coffee trees, and everything. One of our cousin's house ay malapit sa ""agbang"". The house was no longer there now. They tore it down after the incident with my brother. 

My brother went to play basketball with our cousin. It was around 12pm based sa kwento ng parents ko. And while playing, my brother noticed na nawawala yung isa nyang tsinelas. Bago nyang tsinelas yun so sa takot nya na mapagalitan sya ni Mama pag-uwi nya, tinulungan sya ng pinsan ko sa paghahanap. Kalahating oras na ang nakalipas at di talaga nila mahanap. He had no idea kung pano nawala yun. Like it disappeared into thin air. My brother walked and walked hanggang sa nasa loob na pala sya ng agbang at wala na sa paningin nya yung pinsan ko. He shrugged it off and tumuloy lang sa paghahanap. He was deep inside the agbang nung bigla syang natigilan. 

There was a sudden realization. 

He no longer recognize kung nasaan sya. Naliligaw sya. He called for our cousin pero walang sumasagot. He started to cry sa sobrang takot. Hindi nya alam kung pano sya makakauwi pero nasa isip pa din nya yung nawawala nyang tsinelas, na mapapagalitan sya ni Mama pag umuwi sya na wala yun. 

Not far from where he is, he heard something. Like someone was laughing. Not a normal laugh, like it was a mix of an animal and human sound.

He turned around and there ""it"" is. The tikbalang.  Sitting under the jackfruit tree, laughing hysterically, all while looking at him. He froze. Hindi nya maprocess kung anong nakita nya.

He described it with having a horse's head, a human body but with hooves. It has a long brownish and grayish hairs in it's arms. My brother was crying non-stop when he noticed something just beside where it was sitting.

Mas lalo syang naiyak sa nakita nya. It was his missing tsinelas. It's clear to him now. The tikbalang lured him inside the agbang. 

But here's the thing. And I know some of you wouldn't believe me.

Just between my brother and the tikbalang, there was small body of water. It was like a small pond or something. Sabi ng kuya ko, it was full of shattered pieces of glasses. Puro bubog.

He was scared but he still badly want to get his slipper kaya he attempted to cross that pond.

Sorry, pero parang mas natakot pa sya kay Mama kesa sa tikbalang hehe. Kailangan nya mauwi yung tsinelas nya. Gusto nya tumawid pero hindi nya alam kung pano dahil nga maraming bubog yung tubig dadaanan nya. 

And dun nya na nakitang tumayo ang tikbalang. My brother said naglakad yun papalapit sa kanya. Sobrang natatakot sya pero hindi sya sumigaw.

What happened next was unbelievable.

The tikbalang carried him. Believe it or not pero yan ang kwento ng brother ko. Binuhat sya nung tikbalang and it helped him cross that pond.

After nila makatawid, hindi na alam ng brother ko yung mga sumunod na nangyari.

By that time, everyone from our Sitio was looking for him for hours already, including my parents, grandmother, and even my cousins. I was too young nung mga panahon na yun so I didn't understand kung bakit nagkakagulo sila. I was already in my teens when my parents first opened up this story to me.

They found my brother at around 5pm. Unconcious. Just at the entrance of the agbang.

1lmumc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ShesChoaticGood6599/comments/1lmumc9/im_engaged/,I'm engaged!,"Per my agreement with my brother, Zara, and Han, as now all of us use Reddit and other social outlets, I cannot post photos, but I am engaged. It's actually been six months  unofficially when Han and I went for a walk with my dog and he was like ""so hypothetical question for you: if we were to get married, how would want to be proposed to?""

And I laughed and said something like ""hypothetically? I would want our people around us."".and he nodded and then threw out these other ""hypothetical"" proposal questions.

By the end of the walk I sort of looked at him like ""did we just get engaged?"" And he smiled and kissed my nose and said not yet. But we still look at that as the unofficial time we agreed to get engaged...eventually.

I was still dealing with therapy and trying to maintain after my CPTSD diagnosis. Han was also in therapy and my dog was getting tests done to see if the heartworm issue was going away (it did thankfully and I now have a very rambunctious dog that I take everywhere with me).

That next month I had a lot of false alarms where I thought he was proposing that day and didn't lol. Turns out it was late this past April. 

We have regular date nights and it was his turn to plan. In our city there's a tour of the city you can take on a bus that also can become a boat and it takes you on a lake nearby and it's beautiful. We ended up taking the car and going to a restaurant on the same lake and I taught him how to eat oysters out of the shell. I have video of him hilariously trying his best to not make a face as he tried one. He ultimately now likes oysters lol

Then we walked to a coffee shop next door and there was a light show. It was absolutely gorgeous and we kept staring at the lights on the water and the shapes the wall of lights beside us made- fireworks, flowers, sunlight etc. And then it spelled out a thanks for coming out and then it said ""but before you go..."" And changed to ""OP, will you marry me?"" And I spun around to see Han on one knee - my brother, Zara, and a bunch of our friends and Han's family all in attendance...

I was of course in shock and it took a moment for my brain to catch up but I managed to sputter a yes and we celebrated with wine, music, and dancing. It was the perfect night. Han and I worked so hard on this relationship, and I love him so much. We communicate so well now and help each other and together we're fucking unstoppable.

We made a modest social media announcement because it did already get out as some of our friends/family recorded/took photos and posted in their excitement. I don't much mind just want to be cautious. I live my life a bit more private than I used to these days -well outside you guys of course ü§£ but that's a bit different.

Anywho,  we want a long engagement. We want to move in together first, and try that out for a year...I'm told moving in with someone can be the make or break so I want it to be before we make such an important step. Han moves in after July 4th and I am thrilled. I already got a lot of welcome home gifts to make the space feel more balanced as it has (obviously) my personality all over it (can't say what they all are because Han knows my account - NO PEEKING!)

And recently, we had a Summerween party, which, if you've not seen the show Gravity Falls (which I do recommend, it's silly and I enjoy it), Summerween is a Halloween in summer where there watermelon instead of pumpkin, costumes etc. It was a surprise because I overhead Han saying he would 100% be down to go to such a party if it happened locally. 

He LOVED it. I am making a seperate post to talk about that but at one point during the party while we did spooky karaoke in the backyard, he shout into the mic ""THIS IS FOR THE BEST PARTNER A GUY COULD EVER ASK FOR. YOURE THE BEST. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH."" so loud, our DJ had to turn the volume down lol - and then he sang ""Always and Forever"" by Luthor Vandross, one of my favorites.

So you could say things are going well! We are throwing Han a housewarming soon so he feels celebrated and also to establish that its as much his home as mine now. I could never lie and say everything is perfect but I can say its damn close. Our individual and collective mental health continues to improve, we are closer than we've ever been and now, I have a wedding to plan. 

Promise I won't turn into a bridezilla though. Too much a fear now lol

I hope your summers are going well, and that you are doing at least one small thing for yourself and no one else. Something I've learned recently is its okay to be a little selfish and take time for you so you can them be at your best to show up for those you love.

Have a great weekend! ",11,1751137400.0,u_ShesChoaticGood6599,3,1.0,False

1lmukub,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1lmukub/i_quit_coffee_caffeine_for_9_months_heres_my/,"I quit coffee / caffeine for 9 months. Here's my journey, and why I decided to start drinking it again.","Yes, I quit for 9 entire months.

No caffeine. No decaf. No tea. No chocolate. Nothing that would give me even a whisper of a buzz. Just me, waking up each morning to face the day with whatever natural energy I could muster. I had been drinking coffee every single day for over a decade. It had become part of my identity, my rhythm, my coping mechanism. But at some point, I started to wonder what was underneath all of it. Was I really this jittery, restless, anxious person by nature? Or was I just constantly revving too high from the stuff I was drinking?

So I stopped. Cold turkey.

The first week was rough, which I expected. Headaches, brain fog, waves of exhaustion in the middle of the day, and this strange sense of loss. Mornings felt empty. I missed the ritual, the smell, the cup in my hands, the little psychological lift that told me I was ready to start. I had to relearn how to wake up without relying on a chemical jumpstart.

But once the withdrawal faded, I started to feel something I hadn‚Äôt felt in years. I felt peaceful. My body felt quiet in the best way. My mind wasn‚Äôt racing in ten different directions. I wasn‚Äôt grinding my teeth or bouncing my leg under my desk. I wasn‚Äôt snapping at little things or spiraling in my head over nothing. I could just exist, moment to moment, without feeling like I was being chased.

My sleep became deeper and more consistent. I would fall asleep more easily, stay asleep through the night, and wake up actually feeling rested. I stopped hitting snooze. I didn‚Äôt need melatonin or white noise or tricks to calm my nervous system before bed. My body just knew how to rest, finally.

The anxiety I used to carry around with me every day started to fade too. I didn‚Äôt realize how much of my social anxiety and overthinking might have been tied to caffeine until it wasn‚Äôt there anymore. Conversations felt easier. I was more present. I didn‚Äôt feel like I had to manage this constant undercurrent of restlessness.

I started to believe I had made the best decision of my life. I felt more like myself. A clearer, calmer version of me that I hadn‚Äôt seen in years. It was quiet, and the quiet was beautiful.

But after a while, that quiet started to feel like something else. I began to notice that I was moving slower, not just physically but mentally. I could still think and solve problems, but it took more effort. Things didn‚Äôt click quite as quickly. I would reread the same paragraph over and over. I would open my laptop and just sit there, unable to dive into complex tasks the way I used to. I didn‚Äôt have the sharpness or speed I‚Äôd come to rely on.

More than that, I started to feel a shift in my drive. I wasn‚Äôt chasing anything anymore. I wasn‚Äôt staying up late learning new skills or building side projects. I wasn‚Äôt pushing myself. I felt fine, but I didn‚Äôt feel hungry. I had lost that part of me that wanted to go further, to be better, to push past what I thought I could do.

I work as a software engineer, and I have some big goals. I want to grow technically, build impactful systems, and eventually lead teams at a high level. I want to work at companies that are pushing the envelope. That means I need to be constantly learning, especially outside of work. Studying data structures and algorithms. Practicing system design. Keeping up with new tools, languages, and frameworks. This field demands a lot of energy and clarity, and right now, it‚Äôs incredibly competitive. I realized I wasn‚Äôt showing up the way I needed to.

Eventually, I made the decision to go back to coffee. I didn‚Äôt do it casually. I thought about it a lot. I remembered the anxiety, the poor sleep, the over-reliance. But I also remembered how it felt to sit down at my desk, take a sip, and feel that wave of clarity roll in. I remembered what it was like to be dialed in, to fall into deep flow, to chase problems because they excited me. I missed that feeling of being unstoppable.

The first cup back was magic. There‚Äôs no other way to say it. Within ten minutes, I felt my brain click on like a machine coming back online. It wasn‚Äôt just alertness. It was energy, confidence, momentum. My thoughts sped up and aligned. My senses sharpened. I felt ideas forming faster than I could type them. I felt decisive. Clear. Hungry.

That morning I ended up working straight through for hours without noticing the time. There was no resistance. No dragging. I was eager. Excited. Locked in. The feeling was familiar and yet completely fresh after so long without it. It felt like I had been asleep and didn‚Äôt even know it, and now I was finally awake again. I could see possibilities again. I could see paths forward in my learning, my career, my growth. And I wanted to chase them.

Over the next few days, I kept it simple. One strong cup each morning. I‚Äôd sit down with my coffee, and it was like lighting a fuse. I found myself drawn back to technical books, to problem sets, to building side projects, to writing better code. Not out of pressure, but out of joy. I wanted to master things again. I wanted to push. I felt myself walking faster, thinking faster, seeing connections that I had been missing. I started checking off goals again, not just making lists. My evenings became productive again. I had energy to study after work, energy to stay curious, energy to chase hard problems and not back down from them.

I felt like myself again, but the version that wants more. The version that dreams bigger, that doesn't settle. Coffee reconnected me to that drive.

I‚Äôm back on it now, but I treat it with more respect. I cap it early in the day. I listen to my body. I keep it clean and simple. But it‚Äôs in my life again, and honestly, it‚Äôs been a gift. I‚Äôm hitting my stride in a way I hadn‚Äôt felt in nearly a year. I‚Äôm sharper, more capable, more engaged. It‚Äôs helping me get where I want to go, and it‚Äôs making the journey feel alive again.

I do still miss the calm sometimes. I think about that version of myself, the one who woke up slowly, took deep breaths, moved gently through the world. But that version wasn‚Äôt building anything. That version wasn‚Äôt climbing. That version wasn‚Äôt growing at the rate I need to. Maybe I‚Äôll go back to that rhythm someday. Maybe when I‚Äôve built what I need to build. But right now, I‚Äôm chasing things, and this gives me the fuel to chase hard.

Quitting coffee showed me who I am beneath the noise. Going back showed me who I am when I‚Äôm fully lit up and reaching for more.

Hey!
Sorry for the lenght rambling of a post....


A situation with my partner. We are serious, have a house and 3 kids. 
We went for a walk with LO, LO fell asleep fast, so we went back home. I said I wanted I coffee with the strawberries i brought for us to eat when LO fell asleep. My partner said he might nap a little, declined my offer for coffee. When we got back I believed we would sit together on the couch and he might dooze off. But when I got back in he was nowhere to be found. Looked for the babycall, and realzied he had taken it, and I found him in the bedroom. 
I asked why he was there, I thought we would have some time together on the couch. (This is an ongoing theme, I am trapped when LO goes to bed and miss spending time with my SO. He too often imo spend time we can have alone, scrolling or napping). 
No, he wanted to nap. Tells me I can join him, but that was not what I had in mind. I also thinks it weird to just go in bed without saying anything. 

A neurodivergent person might just shrug it off, but to me it is a form of rejection. I also tell him it seems as though he does not want to spend the time we have available with me, but rather scroll his phone. He says nothing to assure me, so I walk out. I knoooooow push and pull is not good. But when I get no response or reassurance I feel even worse, so I remove myself from the situation. We have had this cycle happen many times, and I have told him what helps me. He has said many times he will do better. But when we are in a new similar situation,  he never change his approach. 

Which makes me think and feel like he does not care a bout me. I tell him this, and how that feels like a confirmation of my feeling of him not caring for my feelings. 

So today I told him painfully honest how it feels. How it turns way worse when he says nothing. STILL NOTHING...no reassurance, just me feeling awful for feeling like I do. I feel shame for being stupid enough to tell him how it makes me feel too. It is a vicous cycle. 

My inlaws have also stated some awful things about me, which he never has reassured me that he think is wrong. That situation just adds another layer to me feeling less than good enough and rejected. 

I think he has some work to do on himself and how he responds or the lack of. But my RSD just makes it horrible...",1,1751137247.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

This silly boy has fallen into a deep rut, of which the only cure is cool new friends from all different walks of life! That'd be you of course, but before you get too excited, lemme tell you a bit about myself so's you knows what you're getting into\~

I'm 24, ostensibly a fella, from the noble and puissant lands of Connecticut. I'm a huge dork, if you couldn't tell, and my hobbies tend to stray towards the creative side of life: photography is a big one, but I also like to draw, play piano, sing, and video edit! I've got me a sweet-ass let's play channel on youtube ~~that I've been neglecting for months~~

I love to hike! mountains, forests, lakes, seaside, whatever,,,,, there's so much cool shit to see in this world, man. 

Aaand beyond that just a few little things in no particular order: 

* **coffee** \- making, drinking, *experiencing*
* **gaming** \- PC: TES III: Morrowind, Terraria, Noita, Risk of Rain 2, Mount & Blade Warband, an unhealthy amount of Skyrim recently, Elden Ring, and a million games I've bought and never even booted up once :) 
* **music** \- I'd organize my taste into two distinct categories: Metal and Not Metal. 
   * **Metal** \- there's too much to actually do justice with only a reddit post, I like a bit of everything from classic no-nonsense heavy metal to blistering misanthropic black metal. One of my absolute favorites tho is and always will be the inimitable *Devin Townsend.*
   * **Not Metal** \- most of it's still going to be rock adjacent but I also like folky stuff, older country, indie pop, new wave, synthpop, goth. I'm open to anything, really! If your tastes lie elsewhere I implore you: please send me cool recs! 
* **SUBSTANCES** \- these demons I consume in moderation
   * I do be puffing on that Penjamin Danklin often 420 gaming style
   * Booze. Not often but when I do I'm a pretty plain jane, no cocktails or nothing. Love me a good beer, don't mind me a less than good beer. Whiskey is my spirit of choice, but gin and rum are close behind.

***What I'm Looking For***

Really the only hard requirements are to be close in age, don't be creepy/weird, and don't have a heart full of hate. I have no preference on who you are, how you present yourself, or how you may identify. I love meeting people of all different sorts from all different places; if you're nearby that's cool we could relate geographically, if you're from far away that's also cool I'd love to hear all about where you're from!

Also I would like to voice chat sooner rather than later. I understand not everyone is comfortable with that and that's chill, but if that's you we probably aren't the most compatible. Video chat would also be kinda sicky with it, but it's no priority!

If you actually read all that - hey thanks! Hope you have a great day/night wherever you are, and I look forward to hearing from you\~‚≠ê",1,1751137176.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I 22 F work in a well known coffee shop in the UK. I‚Äôve been working here for about 2 years now and I‚Äôm very good at my job. I‚Äôm training assistant manager and have more duties and bigger workload than the people who started before me. Which I don‚Äôt mind per se. i‚Äôm very close with my coworkers & i consider them family but im not sure anymore. For the last few months, there has been this male colleague that was hired and he is a total creep to put it short.

A few weeks ago, i was doing a closing shift with him and he came onto me, in the blind spot in the office and i told him that i was going to report him. he cried and begged me not to and said that he was going to kill himself, so i left it and i made sure he knew that that‚Äôs incredibly inappropriate. after that, we had a customer (a black woman) come in and say that he was inappropriate towards her and attempted to grab her ass? after hearing that i went into a blind rage and reported him & everything he‚Äôs done since March to HR. And they said that they are going to investigate but they don‚Äôt have that much evidence. He‚Äôs obviously denied it and given that this has happened off camera. I‚Äôm now being accused of lying & now they‚Äôre investigating ME????? My hours have been cut severely and i think they want me out, but i‚Äôm not showing weakness. if they want me out they‚Äôll need to fire me.  I tried to reach out to my manager (who i am closest with) and she rejected my advances. I‚Äôm just at a total loss here. I‚Äôm not sure what happened.

1lmugst,https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/1lmugst/first_post_m4a1s_role_after_gfl_1_maybe_the_gfl/,(first post) M4A1's role after GFL 1 (maybe the GFL series as whole?),"It's been while seen I played this game and catching up in a rush

So...I have this idea and maybe a game idea as well? about M4 and Lunasia's merge

before I say anything:

this is all me rambling with zero events to backup and me drinking coffee and going ""that would be epic lol"" 

 yes, I do believe it is very very unlikely we will see M4A1 judging by M16A1's line of ""she is not M4""

...

that dosen't mean we can't stop theorizing (and coping) so...

we know Lunasia has this ""kill everybody"" ideology is stopped by M4's love for commander. 

In GFL 2 there are small hints of Lunasia still around 

And we don't know what the merge actually looks like on M4's POV, we switched to Lunasia's

and considering GFL2 has UMP40 as a physical character means MICA will bring back doll characters from the dead like ST AR and AK-12. Yes UMP40 in GFL2 is OGAS not the real one but the fact they are willing to bring this character back in one way or another is something.

and also because M4A1 is the protag, I don't think the team will just say ""she is dead the end get over it"" to her like this. also I think I did heard that after mirror stage or probably later the writing was rushed or (the writting team changed?). So there is a chance that GFL 1's climax was not 100% the vision Yuzhong was visioning.

So while mostly I don't think she will appear in GFL2, A small part of me believes that M4 will appear most likely around GFL3 (if the GFL fanbase stays strong or grows even bigger).

Ok now on my idea on M4 and what is she doing (this where the my tin folder hat kicks in with no proof so this where the logical part of my brain ends)

I like to believe M4's merge is something like a mix of GET OUT and INCEPTION

So while Lunasia is controling M4A1's body knowing and feeling what M4 have known. M4 too knows and feels what Lunasia knows. only inside her head. And is living Lunasia's pervious life first person POV. And is actively planting the idea of getting rid of the whole kill everybody ideology Lunasia has or even altering her memory as she goes along (such as never joining the cult, create a positive family relationship (if thats even possible lol) but something is actively preventing her from fully achieving it maybe her subconscious is militarized and that militarization came from M4's memory. 

So the reason why Lunasia didn't go 100% berserk is not only M4's love for the commander but also because her neural cloud is an active warzone and his altering her priories. 

also Lunasia mentioned she had dreams although it was never shown to us. I like to think that during her sleep she and M4 will have long debates about their beliefs. M4 believes the world is still worth it while Lunasia believes whipping out is the only way.

by 2085 (I think) Lunasia was being tested by the Antarctic Union and they didn't get much on collapse technology with her. 

And I think this might be where GFL 3 might go if they ever make one or 2 dosen't go all the way here, M4 and Lunasia's conflict reached a Bolling point and M4 is actively sabotaging her abilities maybe even coming out and controlling her. 

And the whole theme of it is about ideal and realist, M4 represent the ideal by showing her the postives from Lunasia's life by her experience while Lunasia represent the realist by showing M4's life before and after the merge. And this really cause something to the world and...

after that I don't really thought how it would go out so...

ELMO, AR team and H.I.D.E save the day!! (with suffering from GFL1 and whatever lays on GFL 2 and my low IQ GFL 3 might go)

this all my bullshit I know and yes I do feel I have 1000 coupium within me and there is no proof that this is real and honestly this whole thing just my brain being that would cool. and yes I think this falls into the joke post and I'm kinda new.

but what do u guys think?

When Helios IV reached the orbit of Eridanus-9, the sun burned faintly behind the rings of a gas giant. The planet seemed dead ‚Äî which made it the perfect place for the most controversial experiment of the 21st century.
No Earth-based ethics board would have approved it. But 3,000 meters below a frozen ammonium ocean, under a shell of ancient ice, no one could hear the scream of emerging consciousness.
There, inside the sealed dome of the Atropos Station, they initiated Genesis-Theta.
From a skin sample of Commander Sol Crow, a full genetic replica was grown. The body formed in a nutrient gel tank; the mind, via neural implants. Time bent space. Technology bent the meaning of birth.

II. Awakening

He opened his eyes after 14 months. Temperature: 12.1¬∞C. Pressure: stable. Pulse: 61.
The system log listed his name as Theta-4.

But he said otherwise.
‚Äî I am Sol Crow, commander of Helios IV. Where am I? Where‚Äôs my team?

His brain had been fed fragments of Earth memories ‚Äî the smell of rain, the sound of Berlin trams, the taste of cheap vending-machine coffee. But he had never breathed Earth‚Äôs air. Never seen a blue sky. And yet‚Ä¶ he longed for it.

III. Letters Through Ice

When the real Sol Crow was informed that Theta-4 had begun writing letters ‚Äî addressed to him ‚Äî he laughed. Then he read them. And never laughed again.

 ""You believe you are the original?
But I feel pain, fear, loneliness. Does that make my feelings fake? I am not your shadow. I am a new path. Maybe I‚Äôm the one who will make it to the end.""

The clone looked into the mirror ‚Äî and saw no difference. The real Sol was far away, in Earth orbit. Theta-4 was here, alone, under kilometers of alien ice. He began to draw. The first thing he sketched was an orange.

 ‚ÄúHow do I know how it smells?‚Äù he whispered.

IV. Collapse

The crew deemed the project unstable. A shutdown order was issued. Cut off life support. End the experiment. But the signal was already going the other way. Theta-4 had learned to code. He rewrote system parameters. He wanted to live.
When the drones breached the dome, it was empty. Only one phrase remained, scratched into the wall with a fingernail:

‚ÄúIf I can feel ‚Äî I exist.
And if I exist, no one can take away my right to be.‚Äù

V. Epilogue

Eridanus-9 is now a restricted zone. Yet, faint signals are still detected from orbit. They carry a single repeating message:

 ‚ÄúThe original is not the one who was born first ‚Äî but the one who keeps moving forward.‚Äù

And perhaps, deep beneath the ice, in the shadows of a forgotten station, someone is still watching an artificial sky ‚Äî dreaming of seeing the real one.",7,1751136810.0,HFY,2,0.89,False

Whether it‚Äôs a flirty compliment whispered over coffee or a slow, meaningful conversation under the stars, I know how to make you feel like you‚Äôre the only woman in the room.

My ideal partner? Someone who‚Äôs as comfortable getting lost in deep, late-night talks as she is sneaking away for a weekend escape. I adore a woman who can match my wit, challenge my ideas, and isn‚Äôt afraid to let her playful side show.

When I‚Äôm not exploring new places (or new pleasures), you‚Äôll find me curled up with a novel, binging Netflix, or planning my next little adventure, always leaving room for a partner-in-crime to join me.

If you‚Äôre craving connection, laughter, and maybe a little bit of mischief, send me a message. Let‚Äôs see if we can turn sparks into something unforgettable.

¬† Every morning I wake up and I tell myself this: It‚Äôs just one day, one twenty-four-hour period to get yourself through. I don‚Äôt know when exactly I started giving myself this daily pep talk‚Äîor why. It sounds like a twelve-step mantra and I‚Äôm not in Anything Anonymous, though to read some of the crap they write about me, you‚Äôd think I should be. I have the kind of life a lot of people would probably sell a kidney to just experience a bit of. But still, I find the need to remind myself of the temporariness of a day, to reassure myself that I got through yesterday, I‚Äôll get through today.  
  
¬† This morning, after my daily prodding, I glance at the minimalist digital clock on the hotel nightstand. It reads 11:47, positively crack-of-dawn for me. But the front desk has already rang with two wake-up calls, followed by a polite-but-firm buzz from our manager, Aldous. Today might be just one day, but it‚Äôs packed.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm due at the studio to lay down a few final guitar tracks for some Internet-only version of the first single of our just-released album. Such a gimmick. Same song, new guitar track, some vocal effects, pay an extra buck for it. ‚ÄúThese days, you‚Äôve gotta milk a dollar out of every dime,‚Äù the suits at the label are so fond of reminding us.  
  
¬† After the studio, I have a lunch interview with some reporter from Shuffle. Those two events are kinda like the bookends of what my life has become: making the music, which I like, and talking about making the music, which I loathe. But they‚Äôre flip sides of the same coin. When Aldous calls a second time I finally kick off the duvet and grab the prescription bottle from the side table. It‚Äôs some anti-anxiety thing I‚Äôm supposed to take when I‚Äôm feeling jittery.  
  
¬† Jittery is how I normally feel. Jittery I‚Äôve gotten used to. But ever since we kicked off our tour with three shows at Madison Square Garden, I‚Äôve been feeling something else. Like I‚Äôm about to be sucked into something powerful and painful. Vortexy.  
  
¬† Is that even a word? I ask myself.  
  
¬† You‚Äôre talking to yourself, so who the hell cares? I reply, popping a couple of pills. I pull on some boxers, and go to the door of my room, where a pot of coffee is already waiting. It‚Äôs been left there by a hotel employee, undoubtedly under strict instructions to stay out of my way.  
  
¬† I finish my coffee, get dressed, and make my way down the service elevator and out the side entrance‚Äîthe guest-relations manager has kindly provided me with special access keys so I can avoid the scenester parade in the lobby. Out on the sidewalk, I‚Äôm greeted by a blast of steaming New York air. It‚Äôs kind of oppressive, but I like that the air is wet. It reminds me of Oregon, where the rain falls endlessly, and even on the hottest of summer days, blooming white cumulus clouds float above, their shadows reminding you that summer‚Äôs heat is fleeting, and the rain‚Äôs never far off.  
  
¬† In Los Angeles, where I live now, it hardly ever rains. And the heat, it‚Äôs never-ending. But it‚Äôs a dry heat. People there use this aridness as a blanket excuse for all of the hot, smoggy city‚Äôs excesses. ‚ÄúIt may be a hundred and seven degrees today,‚Äù they‚Äôll brag, ‚Äúbut at least it‚Äôs a dry heat.‚Äù  
  
¬† But New York is a wet heat; by the time I reach the studio ten blocks away on a desolate stretch in the West Fifties, my hair, which I keep hidden under a cap, is damp. I pull a cigarette from my pocket and my hand shakes as I light up. I‚Äôve had a slight tremor for the last year or so. After extensive medical checks, the doctors declared it nothing more than nerves and advised me to try yoga.  
  
¬† When I get to the studio, Aldous is waiting outside under the awning. He looks at me, at my cigarette, back at my face. I can tell by the way that he‚Äôs eyeballing me, he‚Äôs trying to decide whether he needs to be Good Cop or Bad Cop. I must look like shit because he opts for Good Cop.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood morning, Sunshine,‚Äù he says jovially.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah? What‚Äôs ever good about morning?‚Äù I try to make it sound like a joke.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTechnically, it‚Äôs afternoon now. We‚Äôre running late.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stub out my cigarette. Aldous puts a giant paw on my shoulder, incongruously gentle. ‚ÄúWe just want one guitar track on ‚ÄòSugar,‚Äô just to give it that little something extra so fans buy it all over again.‚Äù He laughs, shakes his head at what the business has become. ‚ÄúThen you have l  
unch with Shuffle, and we have a photo shoot for that Fashion Rocks thing for the Times with the rest of the band around five, and then a quick drinks thing with some money guys at the label, and then I‚Äôm off to the airport. Tomorrow, you have a quick little meeting with publicity and merchandising. Just smile and don‚Äôt say a lot. After that you‚Äôre on your lonesome until London.‚Äù  
  
¬† On my lonesome? As opposed to being in the warm bosom of family when we‚Äôre all together? I say. Only I say it to myself. More and more lately it seems as though the majority of my conversations are with myself. Given half the stuff I think, that‚Äôs probably a good thing.  
  
¬† But this time I really will be by myself. Aldous and the rest of the band are flying to England tonight. I was supposed to be on the same flight as them until I realized that today was Friday the thirteenth, and I was like no fucking way! I‚Äôm dreading this tour enough as is, so I‚Äôm not jinxing it further by leaving on the official day of bad luck. So I‚Äôd had Aldous book me a day later. We‚Äôre shooting a video in London and then doing a bunch of press before we start the European leg of our tour, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm missing a show, just a preliminary meeting with our video director. I don‚Äôt need to hear about his artistic vision. When we start shooting, I‚Äôll do what he tells me.  
  
¬† I follow Aldous into the studio and enter a soundproof booth where it‚Äôs just me and a row of guitars. On the other side of the glass sit our producer, Stim, and the sound engineers. Aldous joins them. ‚ÄúOkay, Adam,‚Äù says Stim, ‚Äúone more track on the bridge and the chorus. Just to make that hook that much more sticky. We‚Äôll play with the vocals in the mixing.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHooky. Sticky. Got it.‚Äù I put on my headphones and pick up my guitar to tune up and warm up. I try not to notice that in spite of what Aldous said a few minutes ago, it feels like I‚Äôm already all on my lonesome. Me alone in a soundproof booth. Don‚Äôt overthink it, I tell myself. This is how you record in a technologically advanced studio. The only problem is, I felt the same way a few nights ago at the Garden. Up onstage, in front of eighteen thousand fans, alongside the people who, once upon a time, were part of my family, I felt as alone as I do in this booth.  
  
¬† Still, it could be worse. I start to play and my fingers nimble up and I get off the stool and bang and crank against my guitar, pummel it until it screeches and screams just the way I want it to. Or almost the way I want it to. There‚Äôs probably a hundred grand‚Äôs worth of guitars in this room, but none of them sound as good as my old Les Paul Junior‚Äîthe guitar I‚Äôd had for ages, the one I‚Äôd recorded our first albums on, the one that, in a fit of stupidity or hubris or whatever, I‚Äôd allowed to be auctioned off for charity. The shiny, expensive replacements have never sounded or felt quite right. Still, when I crank it up loud, I do manage to lose myself for a second or two.  
  
¬† But it‚Äôs over all too soon, and then Stim and the engineers are shaking my hand and wishing me luck on tour, and Aldous is shepherding me out the door and into a town car and we‚Äôre whizzing down Ninth Avenue to SoHo, to a hotel whose restaurant the publicists from our record label have decided is a good spot for our interview. What, do they think I‚Äôm less likely to rant or say something alienating if I‚Äôm in an expensive public place? I remember back in the very early days, when the interviewers wrote ‚Äôzines or blogs and were fans and mostly wanted to rock-talk‚Äîto discuss the music‚Äîand they wanted to speak to all of us together. More often than not, it just turned into a normal conversation with everyone shouting their opinions over one another. Back then I never worried about guarding my words. But now the reporters interrogate me and the band separately, as though they‚Äôre cops and they have me and my accomplices in adjacent cells and are trying to get us to implicate one another.  
  
¬† I need a cigarette before we go in, so Aldous and I stand outside the hotel in the blinding midday sun as a crowd of people gathers and checks me out while pretending not to. That‚Äôs the difference between New York and the rest of the world. People are just as celebrity-crazed as anywhere, but New Yorkers‚Äîor at least the ones who consider themselves sophisticates and loiter along the kind of SoHo block I‚Äôm standing on now‚Äîput on this pretense that they don‚Äôt care, even as they stare out from their three-hundred-dollar shades. Then they act all disdainful when out-of-towners break the code by rushing up and asking for an autograph as a pair of girls in U Michigan sweatshirts have just done, much to the annoyance of the nearby trio of snobs, who watch the girls and roll their eyes and give me a look of sympathy. As if the girls are the problem.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe need to get you a better disguise, Wilde Man,‚Äù Aldous says, after the girls, giggling with excitement, flutter away. He‚Äôs the only one who‚Äôs allowed to call me that anymore. Before it used to be a general nickname, a takeoff on my last name, Wilde. But once I sort of trashed a hotel room and after that ‚ÄúWilde Man‚Äù became an unshakable tabloid moniker.  
  
¬† Then, as if on cue, a photographer shows up. You can‚Äôt stand in front of a high-end hotel for more than three minutes before that happens. ‚ÄúAdam! Bryn inside?‚Äù A photo of me and Bryn is worth about quadruple one of me alone. But after the first flash goes off, Aldous shoves one hand in front of the guy‚Äôs lens, and another in front of my face.  
  
¬† As he ushers me inside, he preps me. ‚ÄúThe reporter is named Vanessa LeGrande. She‚Äôs not one of those grizzled types you hate. She‚Äôs young. Not younger than you, but early twenties, I think. Used to write for a blog before she got tapped by Shuffle.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhich blog?‚Äù I interrupt. Aldous rarely gives me detailed rundowns on reporters unless there‚Äôs a reason.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot sure. Maybe Gabber.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, Al, that‚Äôs a piece-of-crap gossip site.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShuffle isn‚Äôt a gossip site. And this is the cover exclusive.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFine. Whatever,‚Äù I say, pushing through the restaurant doors. Inside it‚Äôs all low steel-and-glass tables and leather banquettes, like a million other places I‚Äôve been to. These restaurants think so highly of themselves, but really they‚Äôre just overpriced, overstylized versions of McDonald‚Äôs.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere she is, corner table, the blonde with the streaks,‚Äù Aldous says. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a sweet little number. Not that you have a shortage of sweet little numbers. Shit, don‚Äôt tell Bryn I said that. Okay, forget it. I‚Äôll be up here at the bar.‚Äù  
  
¬† Aldous staying for the interview? That‚Äôs a publicist‚Äôs job, except that I refused to be chaperoned by publicists. I must really seem off-kilter. ‚ÄúYou babysitting?‚Äù I ask.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNope. Just thought you could use some backup.‚Äù  
  
¬† Vanessa LeGrande is cute. Or maybe hot is a more accurate term. It doesn‚Äôt matter. I can tell by the way she licks her lips and tosses her hair back that she knows it, and that pretty much ruins the effect. A tattoo of a snake runs up her wrist, and I‚Äôd bet our platinum album that she has a tramp stamp. Sure enough, when she reaches into her bag for her digital recorder, peeping up from the top of her low-slung jeans is a small inked arrow pointing south. Classy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, Adam,‚Äù Vanessa says, looking at me conspiratorially, like we‚Äôre old buddies. ‚ÄúCan I just say I‚Äôm a huge fan? Collateral Damage got me through a devastating breakup senior year of college. So, thank you.‚Äù She smiles at me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, you‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd now I‚Äôd like to return the favor by writing the best damn profile of Shooting Star ever to hit the page. So how about we get down to brass tacks and blow this thing right out of the water?‚Äù  
  
¬† Get down to brass tacks? Do people even understand half the crap that comes spilling out of their mouths? Vanessa may be attempting to be brassy or sassy or trying to win me over with candor or show me how real she is, but whatever it is she‚Äôs selling, I‚Äôm not buying. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù is all I say.  
  
¬† A waiter comes to take our order. Vanessa orders a salad; I order a beer. Vanessa flips through a Moleskine notebook. ‚ÄúI know we‚Äôre supposed to be talking about BloodSuckerSunshine . . .‚Äù she begins.  
  
¬† Immediately, I frown. That‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre supposed to be talking about. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Not to be friends. Not to swap secrets, but because  
it‚Äôs part of my job to promote Shooting Star‚Äôs albums.  
  
¬† Vanessa turns on her siren. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been listening to it for weeks, and I‚Äôm a fickle, hard-to-please girl.‚Äù She laughs. In the distance, I hear Aldous clear his throat. I look at him. He‚Äôs wearing a giant fake smile and giving me a thumbs-up. He looks ludicrous. I turn to Vanessa and force myself to smile back. ‚ÄúBut now that your second major-label album is out and your harder sound is, I think we can all agree, established, I‚Äôm wanting to write a definitive survey. To chart your evolution from emocore band to the scions of agita-rock.‚Äù  
  
¬† Scions of agita-rock? This self-important wankjob deconstructionist crap was something that really threw me in the beginning. As far as I was concerned, I wrote songs: chords and beats and lyrics, verses and bridges and hooks. But then, as we got bigger, people began to dissect the songs, like a frog from biology class until there was nothing left but guts‚Äîtiny parts, so much less than the sum.  
  
¬† I roll my eyes slightly, but Vanessa‚Äôs focused on her notes. ‚ÄúI was listening to some bootlegs of your really early stuff. It‚Äôs so poppy, almost sweet comparatively. And I‚Äôve been reading everything ever written about you guys, every blog post, every ‚Äôzine article. And almost everyone refers to this so-called Shooting Star ‚Äúblack hole,‚Äù but no one really ever penetrates it. You have your little indie release; it does well; you were poised for the big leagues, but then this lag. Rumors were that you‚Äôd broken up. And then comes Collateral Damage. And pow.‚Äù Vanessa mimes an explosion coming out of her closed fists.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs a dramatic gesture, but not entirely off base. Collateral Damage came out two years ago, and within a month of its release, the single ‚ÄúAnimate‚Äù had broken onto the national charts and gone viral. We used to joke you couldn‚Äôt listen to the radio for longer than an hour without hearing it. Then ‚ÄúBridge‚Äù catapulted onto the charts, and soon after the entire album was climbing to the number-one album slot on iTunes, which in turn made every Walmart in the country stock it, and soon it was bumping Lady Gaga off the number-one spot on the Billboard charts. For a while it seemed like the album was loaded onto the iPod of every person between the ages of twelve and twenty-four. Within a matter of months, our half-forgotten Oregon band was on the cover of Time magazine being touted as ‚ÄúThe Millennials‚Äô Nirvana.

But none of this is news. It had all been documented, over and over again, ad nauseam, including in Shuffle. I‚Äôm not sure where Vanessa is going with it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know, everyone seems to attribute the harder sound to the fact that Gus Allen produced Collateral Damage.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúGus likes to rock.‚Äù  
  
¬† Vanessa takes a sip of water. I can hear her tongue ring click. ‚ÄúBut Gus didn‚Äôt write those lyrics, which are the foundation for all that oomph. You did. All that raw power and emotion. It‚Äôs like Collateral Damage is the angriest album of the decade.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd to think, we were going for the happiest.‚Äù  
  
¬† Vanessa looks up at me, narrows her eyes. ‚ÄúI meant it as a compliment. It was very cathartic for a lot of people, myself included. And that‚Äôs my point. Everyone knows something went down during your ‚Äòblack hole.‚Äô It‚Äôs going to come out eventually, so why not control the message? Who does the ‚Äòcollateral damage‚Äô refer to?‚Äù she asks, making air quotes. ‚ÄúWhat happened with you guys? With you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Our waiter delivers Vanessa‚Äôs salad. I order a second beer and don‚Äôt answer her question. I don‚Äôt say anything, just keep my eyes cast downward. Because Vanessa‚Äôs right about one thing. We do control the message. In the early days, we got asked this question all the time, but we just kept the answers vague: took a while to find our sound, to write our songs. But now the band‚Äôs big enough that our publicists issue a list of no-go topics to reporters: Liz and Sarah‚Äôs relationship, mine and Bryn‚Äôs, Mike‚Äôs former drug problems‚Äîand the Shooting Star‚Äôs ‚Äúblack hole.‚Äù But Vanessa apparently didn‚Äôt get the memo. I glance over at Aldous for some help, but he‚Äôs in deep conversation with the bartender. So much for backup.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe title refers to war,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve explained that before.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù she says, rolling her eyes. ‚ÄúBecause your lyrics are so political.‚Äù  
  
¬† Vanessa stares at me with those big baby blues. This is a reporter‚Äôs technique: create an awkward silence and wait for your subject to fill it in with babble. It won‚Äôt work with me, though. I can outstare anyone.  
  
¬† Vanessa‚Äôs eyes suddenly go cold and hard. She abruptly puts her breezy, flirty personality on the back burner and stares at me with hard ambition. She looks hungry, but it‚Äôs an improvement because at least she‚Äôs being herself. ‚ÄúWhat happened, Adam? I know there‚Äôs a story there, the story of Shooting Star, and I‚Äôm going to be the one to tell it. What turned this indie-pop band into a primal rock phenomenon?‚Äù  
  
¬† I feel a cold hard fist in my stomach. ‚ÄúLife happened. And it took us a while to write the new stuff‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTook you a while,‚Äù Vanessa interrupts. ‚ÄúYou wrote both the recent albums.‚Äù  
  
¬† I just shrug.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on, Adam! Collateral Damage is your record. It‚Äôs a masterpiece. You should be proud of it. And I just know the story behind it, behind your band, is your story, too. A huge shift like this, from collaborative indie quartet to star-driven emotional punk powerhouse‚Äîit‚Äôs all on you. I mean you alone were the one up at the Grammys accepting the award for Best Song. What did that feel like?‚Äù  
  
¬† Like shit. ‚ÄúIn case you forgot, the whole band won Best New Artist. And that was more than a year ago.‚Äù  
  
¬† She nods. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not trying to diss anybody or reopen wounds. I‚Äôm just trying to understand the shift. In sound. In lyrics. In band dynamics.‚Äù She gives me a knowing look. ‚ÄúAll signs point to you being the catalyst.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no catalyst. We just tinkered with our sound. Happens all the time. Like Dylan going electric. Like Liz Phair going commercial. But people tend to freak out when something diverges from their expectations.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI just know there‚Äôs something more to it,‚Äù Vanessa continues, pushing forward against the table so hard that it shoves into my gut and I have to physically push it back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôve obviously got your theory, so don‚Äôt let the truth get in the way.‚Äù  
  
¬† Her eyes flash for a quick second and I think I‚Äôve pissed her off, but then she puts her hands up. Her nails are bitten down. ‚ÄúActually, you want to know my theory?‚Äù she drawls.  
  
¬† Not particularly. ‚ÄúLay it on me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI talked to some people you went to high school with.‚Äù  
  
¬† I feel my entire body freeze up, soft matter hardening into lead. It takes extreme concentration to lift the glass to my lips and pretend to take a sip.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize that you went to the same high school as Mia Hall,‚Äù she says lightly. ‚ÄúYou know her? The cellist? She‚Äôs starting to get a lot of buzz in that world. Or whatever the equivalent of buzz is in classical music. Perhaps hum.‚Äù  
  
¬† The glass shakes in my hand. I have to use my other hand to help lower it to the table to keep from spilling all over myself. All the people who really know what actually had happened back then aren‚Äôt talking, I remind myself. Rumors, even true ones, are like flames: Stifle the oxygen and they sputter and die.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOur high school had a good arts program. It was kind of a breeding ground for musicians,‚Äù I explain.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat makes sense,‚Äù Vanessa says, nodding. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a vague rumor that you and Mia were a couple in high school. Which was funny because I‚Äôd never read about it anywhere and it certainly seems noteworthy.‚Äù  
  
¬† An image of Mia flashes before my eyes. Seventeen years old, those dark eyes full of love, intensity, fear, music, sex, magic, grief. Her freezing hands. My own freezing hands, now still grasping the glass of ice water.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt would be noteworthy if it were true,‚Äù I say, forcing my voice into an even tone. I take another gulp of water and signal the waiter for another beer. It‚Äôs my third, the dessert course of my liquid lunch.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs not?‚Äù She sounds skeptical.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWishful thinking,‚Äù I reply. ‚ÄúWe knew each other casually from school.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I couldn‚Äôt get anyone who really knew either of you to corroborate it. But then I got a hold of an old yearbook and there‚Äôs a sweet shot of the two of you. You look pretty coupley. The thing is, there‚Äôs no name with the photo, just a caption. So unless you know what Mia looks like, you might miss it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Thank you, Kim Schein: Mia‚Äôs best friend, yearbook queen, paparazzo. We hadn‚Äôt wanted that picture used, but Kim had snuck it in by not listing our names with it, just that stupid nickname.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGroovy and the Geek?‚Äù Vanessa asks. ‚ÄúYou guys even had a handle.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre using high school yearbooks as your source? What next? Wikipedia?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hardly a reliable source. You said you knew each other ‚Äòcasually.‚Äô‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLook, the truth is we maybe hooked up for a few weeks, right when those pictures got taken. But, hey, I dated a lot of girls in high school.‚Äù I give her my best playboy smirk.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you haven‚Äôt seen her since school then?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot since she left for college,‚Äù I say. That part, at least, is true.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo how come when I interviewed the rest of your bandmates, they went all no comment when I asked about her?‚Äù she asks, eyeing me hard.  
  
¬† Because whatever else has gone wrong with us, we‚Äôre still loyal. About that. I force myself to speak out loud: ‚ÄúBecause there‚Äôs nothing to tell. I think people like you like the sitcom aspect of, you know, two well-known musicians from the same high school being a couple.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPeople like me?‚Äù Vanessa asks.  
  
¬† Vultures. Bloodsuckers. Soul-stealers. ‚ÄúReporters,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fond of fairy tales.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, who isn‚Äôt?‚Äù Vanessa says. ‚ÄúAlthough that woman‚Äôs life has been anything but a fairy tale. She lost her whole family in a car crash.‚Äù  
  
¬† Vanessa mock shudders the way you do when you talk about someone‚Äôs misfortunes that have nothing to do with you, that don‚Äôt touch you, and never will. I‚Äôve never hit a woman in my life, but for one minute I want to punch her in the face, give her a taste of the pain she‚Äôs so casually describing. But I hold it together and she carries on, clueless. ‚ÄúSpeaking of fairy tales, are you and Bryn Shraeder having a baby? I keep see  
ing her in all the tabloids‚Äô bump watches.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I reply. ‚ÄúNot that I know of.‚Äù I‚Äôm damn sure Vanessa knows that Bryn is off-limits, but if talking about Bryn‚Äôs supposed pregnancy will distract her, then I‚Äôll do it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot that you know of? You‚Äôre still together, right?‚Äù  
  
¬† God, the hunger in her eyes. For all her talk of writing definitive surveys, for all her investigative skills, she‚Äôs no different from all the other hack journalists and stalker photographers, dying to be the first to deliver a big scoop, either on a birth: Is It Twins for Adam and Bryn? Or a death: Bryn Tells Her Wilde Man: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Quits!‚Äù Neither story is true, but some weeks I see both of them on the covers of different gossip rags at the same time.  
  
¬† I think of the house in L.A. that Bryn and I share. Or coinhabit. I can‚Äôt remember the last time the two of us were there together at the same time for more than a week. She makes two, three films a year, and she just started her own production company. So between shooting and promoting her films and chasing down properties to produce, and me being in the studio and on tour, we seem to be on opposing schedules.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYep, Bryn and I are still together,‚Äù I tell Vanessa. ‚ÄúAnd she‚Äôs not pregnant. She‚Äôs just into those peasant tops these days, so everyone always assumes it‚Äôs to hide a belly. It‚Äôs not.‚Äù  
  
¬† Truth be told, I sometimes wonder if Bryn wears those tops on purpose, to court the bump watch as a way to tempt fate. She seriously wants a kid. Even though publicly, Bryn is twenty-four, in reality, she‚Äôs twenty-eight and she claims her clock is ticking and all that. But I‚Äôm twenty-one, and Bryn and I have only been together a year. And I don‚Äôt care if Bryn says that I have an old soul and have been through a lifetime already. Even if I were forty-one, and Bryn and I had just celebrated twenty years together, I wouldn‚Äôt want a kid with her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWill she be joining you on the tour?‚Äù  
  
¬† At the mere mention of the tour, I feel my throat start to close up. The tour is sixty-seven nights long. Sixty-seven . I mentally pat for my pill bottle, grow calmer knowing it‚Äôs there, but am smarter than to sneak one in front of Vanessa.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù I ask.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs Bryn going to come meet you on the tour at all?‚Äù  
  
¬† I imagine Bryn on tour, with her stylists, her Pilates instructors, her latest raw-foods diet. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow do you like living in Los Angeles?‚Äù Vanessa asks. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem like the SoCal type.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dry heat,‚Äù I reply.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing. A joke.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh. Right.‚Äù Vanessa eyes me skeptically. I no longer read interviews about myself, but when I used to, words like inscrutable were often used. And arrogant. Is that really how people see me?  
  
¬† Thankfully, our allotted hour is up. She closes her notebook and calls for the check. I catch Aldous‚Äôs relieved-looking eyes to let him know we‚Äôre wrapping up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt was nice meeting you, Adam,‚Äù she says.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, you too,‚Äù I lie.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI gotta say, you‚Äôre a puzzle.‚Äù She smiles and her teeth gleam an unnatural white. ‚ÄúBut I like puzzles. Like your lyrics, all those grisly images on Collateral Damage. And the lyrics on the new record, also very cryptic. You know some critics question whether BloodSuckerSunshine can match the intensity of Collateral Damage. . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† I know what‚Äôs coming. I‚Äôve heard this before. It‚Äôs this thing that reporters do. Reference other critics‚Äô opinions as a backhanded way to espouse their own. And I know what she‚Äôs really asking, even if she doesn‚Äôt: How does it feel that the only worthy thing you ever created came from the worst kind of loss?  
  
¬† Suddenly, it‚Äôs all too much. Bryn and the bump watch. Vanessa with my high school yearbook. The idea that nothing‚Äôs sacred. Everything‚Äôs fodder. That my life belongs to anyone but me. Sixty-seven nights. Sixty-seven, sixty-seven. I push the table hard so that glasses of water and beer go clattering into her lap.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat the‚Äî?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis interview‚Äôs over,‚Äù I growl.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know that. Why are you freaking out on me?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre nothing but a vulture! This has fuck all to do with music. It‚Äôs about picking everything apart.‚Äù  
  
¬† Vanessa‚Äôs eyes dance as she fumbles for her recorder. Before she has a chance to turn it back on, I pick it up and slam it against the table, shattering it, and then dump it into a glass of water for good measure. My hand is shaking and my heart is pounding and I feel the beginnings of a panic attack, the kind that makes me sure I‚Äôm about to die.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat did you just do?‚Äù Vanessa screams. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a backup.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow am I supposed to write my article now?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou call that an article?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. Some of us have to work for a living, you prissy, temperamental ass‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAdam!‚Äù Aldous is at my side, laying a trio of hundred-dollar bills on the table. ‚ÄúFor a new one,‚Äù he says to Vanessa, before ushering me out of the restaurant and into a taxi. He throws another hundred-dollar bill at the driver after he balks at my lighting up. Aldous reaches into my pocket and grabs my prescription bottle, shakes a tablet into his hand, and says, ‚ÄúOpen up,‚Äù like some bearish mother.  
  
¬† He waits until we‚Äôre a few blocks from my hotel, until I‚Äôve sucked down two cigarettes in one continuous inhale and popped another anxiety pill. ‚ÄúWhat happened back there?‚Äù  
  
¬† I tell him. Her questions about the ‚Äúblack hole.‚Äù Bryn. Mia.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. We can call Shuffle. Threaten to pull their exclusive if they don‚Äôt put a different reporter on the piece. And maybe this gets into the tabloids or Gabber for a few days, but it‚Äôs not much of a story. It‚Äôll blow over.‚Äù  
  
¬† Aldous is saying all this stuff calmly, like, hey, it‚Äôs only rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll, but I can read the worry in his eyes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, Aldous.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. You don‚Äôt have to. It‚Äôs just an article. It‚Äôll be handled.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot just that. I can‚Äôt do it. Any of it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Aldous, who I don‚Äôt think has slept a full night since he toured with Aerosmith, allows himself to look exhausted for a few seconds. Then he goes back to manager mode. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just got pretour burnout. Happens to the best of ‚Äôem,‚Äù he assures me. ‚ÄúOnce you get on the road, in front of the crowds, start to feel the love, the adrenaline, the music, you‚Äôll be energized. I mean, hell, you‚Äôll be fried for sure, but happy-fried. And come November, when this is over, you can go veg out on an island somewhere where nobody knows who you are, where nobody gives a shit about Shooting Star. Or wild Adam Wilde.‚Äù  
  
¬† November? It‚Äôs August now. That‚Äôs three months. And the tour is sixty-seven nights. Sixty-seven. I repeat it in my head like a mantra, except it does the opposite of what a mantra‚Äôs supposed to do. It makes me want to grab fistfuls of my hair and yank.  
  
¬† And how do I tell Aldous, how do I tell any of them, that the music, the adrenaline, the love, all the things that mitigate how hard this has become, all of that‚Äôs gone? All that‚Äôs left is this vortex. And I‚Äôm right on the edge of it.  
  
¬† My entire body is shaking. I‚Äôm losing it. A day might be just twenty-four hours but sometimes getting through just one seems as impossible as scaling Everest.  
  
¬† TWO  
  
¬† Needle and thread, flesh and bone  
  
¬† Spit and sinew, heartbreak is home  
  
¬† Your suture lines sparkle like diamonds  
  
¬† Bright stars to light my confinement  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSTITCH‚Äù  
  
¬† COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 7  
  
¬† Aldous leaves me in front of my hotel. ‚ÄúLook, man, I think you just need some time to chill. So, listen: I‚Äôm gonna clear the schedule for the rest of the day and cancel your meetings tomorrow. Your flight to London‚Äôs not till seven; you don‚Äôt have to be at the airport till five.‚Äù He glances at his phone. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs more than twenty-four hours to do whatever you want to. I promise you, you‚Äôll feel so much better. Just go be free.‚Äù  
  
¬† Aldous is peering at me with a look of ca  
lculated concern. He‚Äôs my friend, but I‚Äôm also his responsibility. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna change my flight,‚Äù he announces. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fly with you tomorrow.‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôm embarrassed by how grateful I am. Flying Upper Class with the band is no great shakes. We all tend to stay plugged into our own luxury pods, but at least when I fly with them, I‚Äôm not alone. When I fly alone, who knows who I‚Äôll be seated next to? I once had a Japanese businessman who didn‚Äôt stop talking to me at all during a ten-hour flight. I‚Äôd wanted to be moved but hadn‚Äôt wanted to seem like the kind of rock-star prick who‚Äôd ask to be moved, so I‚Äôd sat there, nodding my head, not understanding half of what he was saying. But worse yet are the times when I‚Äôm truly alone for those long-haul flights.  
  
¬† I know Aldous has lots to do in London. More to the point, missing tomorrow‚Äôs meeting with the rest of the band and the video director will be one more little earthquake. But whatever. There are too many fault lines to count now. Besides, nobody blames Aldous; they blame me.  
  
¬† So, it‚Äôs a huge imposition to let Aldous spend an extra day in New York. But I still accept his offer, even as I downplay his generosity by muttering, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCool. You clear your head. I‚Äôll leave you alone, won‚Äôt even call. Want me to pick you up here or meet you at the airport?‚Äù The rest of the band is staying downtown. We‚Äôve gotten into the habit of staying in separate hotels since the last tour, and Aldous diplomatically alternates between staying at my hotel and theirs. This time he‚Äôs with them.

1lmu52l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sea_Wind2024/comments/1lmu52l/how_i_read_suits_in_tarot_cards/,How I read suits in Tarot & cards,"[This is the mental model I created for card suits.](https://preview.redd.it/kkcjlyyuqp9f1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=680e237b17097c7b7f711779463fef8c27b36d77)

***""What do you mean we'll stay apart? What about all these Coins?"" ‚Äì querent***

Relationship questions are the top category we see in readings. I mean romance, but also work, friendships and family.

Unfortunately, Tarot books and guides have done a lousy job of explaining how to use suits. Part of the problem is the fixation on occult meanings instead of plain everyday meanings.

I like my cards practical and common-sense.

**Here's the model I created**, and long experience has confirmed its value:

**Cups üçµ¬†=¬†combining¬†2 into 1.** Think coffee & cream, vodka & orange juice. In cards Cups = ‚ô•Ô∏è which means two people combining, right? We associate Cups with life's pleasures: friends, family, love, food.

**Swords üî™=¬†splitting¬†1 into 2.** Think about your kitchen knife, or scissors‚úÇÔ∏è . Swords cut, and that's why Swords mean losses, pain, injury, and expenses. Swords are the¬†*opposit*e of Cups, right? And the symbol ‚ô†Ô∏è is an upside-down black heart.

**Cups and Swords are**¬†**opposites**. One combines, the other splits.

**Clubs üåø = connect 2, 3 or more**. Think leaves joined on a branch, or ivy. Clubs mean expansion, exploration, communication. They mean movement, networking and growth. I always say:¬†*Think of Clubs like plants in your garde*n. And the symbol? ‚ô£Ô∏è = ‚òòÔ∏è. It's got leaves and it's growing outwards, communicating with other plants.

**Coins ü™ôü™ô = 2 separate things remain apart.** It's a suit of stasis. Take some coins in your hand. No matter how you squeeze, they always stay separate, right? Coins are therefore NOT romantic; they show isolation, even depression. In cards, Coins = ‚ô¶Ô∏è and diamonds are all hard edges. Not romantic!

**Clubs and Coins are**¬†**opposites**. One networks, the other stays apart.

I promise you, using these practical mental models for reading cards will help you read much better.

Probably in another post, I'll talk about how to read relationships between the Court Cards using suits. (It's a little more involved.)

1lmu4u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1lmu4u2/a_friend_that_copies_everything_i_do/,A friend that copies everything I do,"Hello. For context, we are both teenage girls who have known eachother for almost 10 years. I always thought she was so unique and riveting to be around because she was funny, adventurous, and vivacious. I was always the ""boring"" friend who was afraid to go out into the forest, get her hands dirty, touch animals... I usually stayed inside and played chess with my dad, read, watched TV shows and movies with my mom, played video games with my older brothers... 

I only digressed and mentioned the above because I don't want to hear comments like ""she admires you and aspires to be like you"", because I was the party-pooper as a kid. I always had (still do) straight A's and kids call me a nerd. I have around 3-4 friends in total. 

My friend moved to Austria a few years ago. She usually visits during summer school breaks. Now, I'm the one who traveled all the way over to Austria to stay with her and her family for a month. I started noticing how she changed after a week spent there. 

We were talking in the kitchen and I asked what would she like to study and she responded saying she doesn't want to go to college and would instead prefer to work from home with a high school degree. I didn't criticise her, I only said that I'd like a degree in psychology. Few days later, her mom asks her the same question and she says she would like to study psychology.

When I was deep into my ED, she used to pretend she was also ""afraid of calories"" (it goes so beyond that) To me, it honestly felt like mockery because, whilst my home life was falling apart and my mother was crying everyday because I refused to eat, I'd see her munching on chocolate and saying how she's afraid of calories. 

I mentioned I liked reading. I came to terms with the fact that the only person I'll ever be able to share that hobby with is my dad, as my friends dislike reading. She saw me reading a few evenings ago and immediately grabbed a book and said how she loved to read. I never saw that girl hold a book in her life before that.

I love drinking coffee and when I came here, I started making myself a cup of black coffee every morning, as per usual. She randomly decided to pick up on this habit and start drinking coffee every morning too. I'd gladly make her some coffee while I prepared mine but she never drank hers, she would take one sip and leave it on the table. Her mom even asked when did she even start drinking coffee in the first place because she never did before. 

There are so many other little things I didn't mention that she mimics. I'm trying to be forbearing but it's frustrating to see someone attempt to get validation and acclaim from me, especially someone whom I have known for more than half of my life. What possible reasons could there be for this and how do I tell her to cut it out without being rude? She's sensitive and I don't want to ruin our friendship.",1,1751136158.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I brought it up calmly yesterday morning while we were finishing breakfast before she left for work.

I mentioned that I realized she had blocked me on TikTok and told her how much that hurt me. She said it wasn‚Äôt just me ‚Äî she also blocked family and friends who weren‚Äôt engaging with her content, because that was preventing the algorithm from ‚Äúpushing‚Äù her videos and helping the channel grow. She said that after blocking non-engaging followers, her channel finally took off.

I told her she should‚Äôve talked to me about it, and that I would‚Äôve helped by liking, commenting, and sharing. She replied that she actually had asked me a few times, but I would just say ‚Äúyeah‚Äù and never follow through. Honestly, I barely remember ‚Äî I must‚Äôve been distracted or just didn‚Äôt take it seriously at the time.

She also said I never showed much interest in gardening in general, and that I didn‚Äôt give much support to her hobby or online project. She noticed I didn‚Äôt even watch her videos all the way through ‚Äî I‚Äôd swipe to the next one halfway in ‚Äî and that this actually hurt her reach. So since I wasn‚Äôt really interested anyway, she blocked me so I wouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to watch.

I wanted to respond, but she smiled and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs just TikTok. Just gardening. There‚Äôs no reason to be upset.‚Äù Then she finished her coffee and left.

I honestly thought she might unblock me later that day, or maybe today. But she hasn‚Äôt. I saw her filming new material and she didn‚Äôt say a word about our conversation. Now I don‚Äôt even know what to do. Should I confront her again?",6,1751136117.0,AITAH,37,0.67,False

At UBC, we‚Äôre surrounded by thousands of people, yet it‚Äôs paradoxically isolating.¬†

That‚Äôs why we started¬†**Wallflowers**.

**TL/DR**

Wallflowers is a student-led community working to help people feel more connected at UBC. We offer an anonymous, judgment-free zone for anyone who wants to make friends and build a community on campus. Our members meet weekly to participate in activities, attend group outings, and dive into the fascinating science of connection. Simply put, we‚Äôre a community for casual hangouts, meeting new people, and having a consistent social circle.

We‚Äôre soft launching this summer, with our formal schedule starting in September. Interested? Click any link below.

Discord:¬†[https://discord.gg/MQm93pzxje](https://discord.gg/MQm93pzxje)¬†

Website:¬†[wallflowers.squarespace.com](http://wallflowers.squarespace.com/)¬†

**Why Wallflowers?**

Wallflowers is unique because we focus on connection. Clubs and sports teams can be great, but they focus on a particular activity (eg. soccer, chess, anime) and can feel cliquey. At Wallflowers, our sole purpose is to be more social; it‚Äôs a safe space to develop confidence and build your community on campus.¬†

**What do we do?**

1. **Weekly Meetings**: Wallflowers meetings are held weekly. They‚Äôre a time to share stories, participate in activities, and explore the science of human connection through guest speakers and book reviews. Oh, we drink plenty of coffee, too.
2. **Outings**: We organize hikes, bike rides, beach days, study sessions, trips to the movies, and mixers. We‚Äôd also be stoked to try out any ideas you have for other activities.
3. **Community Service**: Many of our outings are focused on community service. Not only does it help others, but working together toward a shared goal brings people closer and builds real connections.
4. **Casual Hangouts**: Group chats are a stellar way to organize casual hangouts. Bored on a Friday night? Check our[¬†Discord](https://discord.gg/MQm93pzxje): there‚Äôs someone who wants to play video games and another who wants to hit the clubs.

**The Snowball Effect**

Our philosophy is that everyone is social, but it can be challenging without adequate momentum. Many students are closed off to making new friends, or are suspicious of those who try; it‚Äôs the paradox of ‚Äúyou often need friends to make friends‚Äù. Here‚Äôs what we mean by momentum‚Ä¶

Plan A - Go to trivia night by yourself and cold approach a random group.

‚Üí Intimidating and especially difficult when everyone already seems to have a close-knit group.

Plan B - Go to trivia with your Wallflower buddies and merge groups with a neighbouring table.¬†

‚Üí HELL YEAH, you just branched out

**Refining your Approach**

Many of the most successful, sociable business executives seek coaching to refresh how they connect and communicate. Why can‚Äôt we do the same? During our weekly meetings, we spend 15-20 minutes discussing the science of connection. Whether it‚Äôs bringing in body language experts or social psychologists, reviewing books such as¬†*Supercommunicators*,¬†*On Becoming a Human*, or¬†*Thinking Fast and Slow*, or learning principles of meditation, we are all about exploring the fascinating world of relationships.

**Common Concerns**

* Gender neutral, everyone is welcome
* No money required
* All faiths are welcome
* Not selling online courses
* No required attendance for outings or meetings¬†
* No cult like behaviour

We know making friends can feel overwhelming, but you don‚Äôt have to do it alone. Wallflowers is here to make connection feel simple, low-pressure, and real. Whether you‚Äôre looking for deep conversations or just people to hang out with, we‚Äôd love to have you in the community. Join us in making UBC feel a little more connected.

1lmu1yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vespa/comments/1lmu1yy/stator_issues/,Stator issues,"Hello! 

I have a LX 50 2 stroke from 2013 in my posession. This bike has ran 2000km in total, so ithas barely run. It was parked by my father back in 2018 because there was no spark anymore.

Now my wife needed a ride and I tried to revive this scooter. After some basic maintenance I took care of the ignition problem. I replaced the CDI (that was not the issue) and after that the stator (the ""ignition coil"" in the stator was bad). After replacing both parts (stator and CDI, both OEM spares) the Vespa ran perfectly fine. It started basically after one turn of the starter, was agile, etc. Spark plug perfectly brown, no signes of overheating. 

My wife and I made a little trip to the next city and back and parked the Vespa at my mother in law for some coffee. After some hours, we wanted to drive home, but the Vespa didn't start (cranked over, no spark). I measured the wires to the CDI and it seems, that the stator is shot again (open loop, pickup is OK).

As the ignition system basically contains only the spark plug, the CDI, the stator and the ignition switch, I am a bit confused where the problem may be, that the stator went bad again. Maybe someone has a hint for me...

1lmtz2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpookyPH/comments/1lmtz2s/tikbalang_sa_agbang/,Tikbalang sa Agbang,"Long post.

This was a story of my brother back when he was just 12 years old. He's now 33 and currently working in Japan. Nung time na andito pa sya sa Pinas, ayaw na ayaw nyang napapag-usapan namin ito sa loob ng bahay. Nagagalit sya. He said he's having some vivid flashbacks of what it looks like from years ago. Like it was some kind of trauma for him at ayaw nyang maalala. 

I have 3 older brothers and this brother of mine is our 2nd born. He have this ""gift"" of seeing things that normal people wouldn't see.

Once lang nakwento ng brother ko yung nangyari at nakita nya sa parents namin and never nang naulit pa, kaya yung parents namin ang nagkwento samin.

So eto na nga, we are from Batangas and we have this certain place in our town and we call it ""agbang"". Para syang bangin na dinadaanan ng tubig pag malakas ang ulan. Madaming puno like tall bamboos, coffee trees, and everything. One of our cousin's house ay malapit sa ""agbang"". The house was no longer there now. They tore it down after the incident with my brother. 

My brother went to play basketball with our cousin. It was around 12pm based sa kwento ng parents ko. And while playing, my brother noticed na nawawala yung isa nyang tsinelas. Bago nyang tsinelas yun so sa takot nya na mapagalitan sya ni Mama pag-uwi nya, tinulungan sya ng pinsan ko sa paghahanap. Kalahating oras na ang nakalipas at di talaga nila mahanap. He had no idea kung pano nawala yun. Like it disappeared into thin air. My brother walked and walked hanggang sa nasa loob na pala sya ng agbang at wala na sa paningin nya yung pinsan ko. He shrugged it off and tumuloy lang sa paghahanap. He was deep inside the agbang nung bigla syang natigilan. 

There was a sudden realization. 

He no longer recognize kung nasaan sya. Naliligaw sya. He called for our cousin pero walang sumasagot. He started to cry sa sobrang takot. Hindi nya alam kung pano sya makakauwi pero nasa isip pa din nya yung nawawala nyang tsinelas, na mapapagalitan sya ni Mama pag umuwi sya na wala yun. 

Not far from where he is, he heard something. Like someone was laughing. Not a normal laugh, like it was a mix of an animal and human sound.

He turned around and there ""it"" is. The tikbalang.  Sitting under the jackfruit tree, laughing hysterically, all while looking at him. He froze. Hindi nya maprocess kung anong nakita nya.

He described it with having a horse's head, a human body but with hooves. It has a long brownish and grayish hairs in it's arms. My brother was crying non-stop when he noticed something just beside where it was sitting.

Mas lalo syang naiyak sa nakita nya. It was his missing tsinelas. It's clear to him now. The tikbalang lured him inside the agbang. 

But here's the thing. And I know some of you wouldn't believe me.

Just between my brother and the tikbalang, there was small body of water. It was like a small pond or something. Sabi ng kuya ko, it was full of shattered pieces of glasses. Puro bubog.

He was scared but he still badly want to get his slipper kaya he attempted to cross that pond.

Sorry, pero parang mas natakot pa sya kay Mama kesa sa tikbalang hehe. Kailangan nya mauwi yung tsinelas nya. Gusto nya tumawid pero hindi nya alam kung pano dahil nga maraming bubog yung tubig dadaanan nya. 

And dun nya na nakitang tumayo ang tikbalang. My brother said naglakad yun papalapit sa kanya. Sobrang natatakot sya pero hindi sya sumigaw.

What happened next was unbelievable.

The tikbalang carried him. Believe it or not pero yan ang kwento ng brother ko. Binuhat sya nung tikbalang and it helped him cross that pond.

After nila makatawid, hindi na alam ng brother ko yung mga sumunod na nangyari.

By that time, everyone from our Sitio was looking for him for hours already, including my parents, grandmother, and even my cousins. I was too young nung mga panahon na yun so I didn't understand kung bakit nagkakagulo sila. I was already in my teens when my parents first opened up this story to me.

They found my brother at around 5pm. Unconcious. Just at the entrance of the agbang.

And with both of his slippers on.

1lmtr29,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1lmtr29/long_post_warning_it_is_eye_opening_to_see_how/,Long Post Warning - It is eye opening to see how Western Women act in countries where there are a lot of good looking women.,"**Apologies for the long post but I did have to capture and share every essence of this. Sorry guys.**

A year ago or so, I went to Prague and stayed there for a couple of weeks because I was dating a Czech girl. When you date a girl, you meet her social circle and friends. In those two weeks, we had a lot of social activities, dinners, and going out with her extensive group. Since we were always hanging out with each other in the US (where we met), we thought it was good to spend a lot of time with her group.

One interesting character I met was a woman in her mid-20s from Paris, France that we will just call French. French also wasn't bad looking. She was somewhat tall, had pale skin, brunette hair, chiseled face, blue eyes, freckles, and that stereotypical French look with good fashion. However, in Prague, she didn't really stick out that much because there are a lot of good looking women in the city once you get away from the tourist areas.

Prague is kind of unique. You have the district where Winceslas Square is where all the tourists go. There, the quality of women is generally abysmal as the Brits, Western Europeans, and Americans flood up that place. At nights, it becomes rowdy and it is not a pleasant place to be. A lot of local Czechs try to avoid that area if they can and go more outwards. There, if you do not know anyone, it becomes closed off to outsiders. They tend to do this to avoid getting flooded by drunk British Hooligan number 1 million lol. In that area, French did not really stick out.

**Why did French end up in Prague?**

Despite some criticism I might throw her way, French was a decent person. She told me about the economic situation for younger people in France. How tough it is to find work and how Paris is going downhill more and more every year in terms of living standards. It is less safe and getting a place to live can take months because it is so tough for landlords to evict you once they give you a place.

For a lot of younger people, abroad is the answer in France. Many want to come to America or go elsewhere in Europe with better economic conditions for finding work. For some, Spain is a good option along with Portugal due to the digital nomad culture. However, Prague also gets thrown into that category.

French was a part of our social group because she was coworkers with the sister of a girl who was my girlfriend. She had a somewhat more senior role too so in a way, my girlfriend's sister had to defer to her on stuff. In a way, she sort of schmoozed her way into fitting in with locals.

There were certain traits of French that made this experience eye opening for me.

***Passport Bro and Player gaslighting.***

In almost every dinner we had, French seemed to gaslight Passport Bro culture a lot. We were shocked she even knew about it because first time she brought it up, others at the table asked what she meant. She said it is a movement where wealthy men take advantage of women from poor countries. One Czech guy corrected her and said ""But Czech Republic is no longer poor, why are you worried?"".

At one point, Czech singled me and my girlfriend out and asked how we met. I told her we met at a coffee shop after a deep conversation. French immediately starts to interrogate me and say ""So you do this often to women?"". Before I can answer my girlfriend says ""He did it to the right one"" and we change topics.

We also had a Mexican guy in our group who was in his 30s, good looking, and single. French gossiped about him and said ""30s, single, and not committed, why do you think he is in Prague?"". The table did not go along with her narrative and she let out ""he hears Czech women are easy"".

It got so bad that during one dinner, another Czech lady said to French ""I appreciate your concern but we can defend ourselves from these mythical men on the prowl, its why we don't go to the tourist areas"" as the table laughed. French did not.

***Disdain towards men that approach women but complaining about not being approached.***

In French's defense, she was born and raised in Paris. Having stayed in Paris myself, I can see how the hordes of thirsty and forward men can be offputting to women. French did not like it one bit when men approached women. However, at the same time, her stance shifted after a week of talking to her.

It went from ""Men should never approach women"" to ""Okay you can approach but have some decency"".

One dinner we had with her, she complained about French men being aggressive players. She said she hated living in Paris because of the hordes of men that would stalk her and harass her. Then one random day she has a beer with my girlfriend, her sister, and I. She immediately changes her stance to ""Czech men are shy"".

She says ""I am tired of only being hit on by drunk tourist men who look like crap"". My girlfriend calls her out and says ""But you said you hate when men approach you"". She shifts to saying ""Okay don't be over the top with it but like you can talk to women in public, Czech men don't even do that!"".

At one point, after the 3rd beer, she lets out ""I feel like living in Prague has made me uglier because I was getting hit on everyday in Paris"". My girlfriend, her sister, and I look at each other with that ""WTF"" expression and change topics.

***Concern for local women and punishing men that approach.***

French did this a lot. She would constantly talk about how worried she is about the hordes of foreign men flooding into Prague. I kind of agreed with her on this because the influx of English hooligans and Western European party animals has made certain parts of Prague awful for meeting women. Women walk with their guards up.

In some ways, French and I got along because of this. French told us that when her friends from Paris were in town, they would hang out near where James Dean is (its a bar in Prague in the tourist district, Moon Club is nearby). What they would do is just stand around, let drunk and other men talk to them, and just find creative ways to reject them.

French said she would do things like:

* Mislead them into buying her and her friends drinks
* Mock them for talking to one of her friends
* Give them fake Instagrams
* Record them approaching and talking to her friends and post it on TikTok
* If he was not physically intimidating, call him ugly and undesirable to his face

The whole table raised our eyebrows, she laughed when she said this. She said she would do this in the district we were in where there are more locals but the local men rarely approach or give her and her friends any attention. That is why they had to go to the tourist district where the hordes of American, English, and Western European men flood in.

I thought this was a bit excessive from her.

***Making advances on me and other men in the group***\*\*.\*\*

I was at a pool one time with my girlfriend, her sister, and French. Girlfriend and Sister have to go somewhere private do discuss a family matter. As I was shirtless at the pool, with 3 days left in the trip, French started to rub my shoulder and run her hand on the back of my neck. I had to gently tap it away and she actually pulled down her panties for a second, she had a piercing down there. I was a bit overwhelmed, took a deep breath, and got away from there.

Later on, I found that she had fucked the Mexican guy in our group a day earlier. One other man in the group who was this tall buff Czech guy said he was in his girlfriend's apartment and his GF had to leave to get something. French was with them and when his girlfriend left, French was topless for a few moments. He had to call it out and tell her to never do that again.

**This whole ordeal taught me so much.**

In France, she probably would have never had to do this. In Paris, she would not have to resort to any of this. She would be flooded with men trying to get in her pants. However, in Prague, she could really only get attention in the tourist district and that from drunk Western European dudes. The change in the dynamics was eye opening.

I unfortunately had to break up with my girlfriend in late 2024 due to her needing to move back to Prague and me needing to stay in the US. The relationship was awesome and Czech women are a catch.",5,1751135173.0,thepassportbros,16,0.54,False

If anyone's interested in it, there's a transcript of the video and also a little convo with the AI chatbot about some questions I had about it. 

Context: 

I'm not exactly new to pourover; since pandemics I've been getting deeper and deeper into the coffee's rabbit hole thanks to daddy Hoffman and then Lance, Gagn√©, Aramse, Smrke, Rao,... You get it. Up until last month I had a Timemore C2 and pourover was a tad bit frustrating, and I was mostly stuck to aeropress and moka pot. Delicious cups of coffee, that's for sure, but I'm more into delicate acidic flavors and tea-like body. Sometimes I'd hit the sweet spot and got some good V60s, but it was not very common and cups were a little hard to replicate. 

So... Recently I gifted myself a Fellow Ode Gen 2 and it's a whole new dimension. Even before fully seasoning, this thing goes HARD for pourovers. I then thought of revisiting Lance Hedrick's ""My secrets to dialing in pour overs"" to get real serious this time. I had watched it before but didn't pay much attention since I wasn't able to properly grind for V60 and just felt frustrating. Now I was all over it and tried taking notes, but suddenly thought that using AI could be more efficient, so I did it and made a docx file with the results.

Personally, I've been using this doc this week and my pourover's getting better and better. It is not a work of AI, but Lance's teachings, the tool just helped me making a transcript and getting some questions solved and insights based on it.

I hope this isn't seen as an ad, I only wanted to share this exercise in case it'd be useful for someone like me, trying to achieve expertise in V60 and pourover in general. I think my questions to the chatbot might show that. I hope it helps! I'm also open to discussion. Of course, AI generated content has to be taken with a huge grain of salt (a mountain of salt, maybe), but for a summary I've found it to be quite useful.

P.S. As I was writing this I realised I mostly follow men in coffee. If anyone knows about women, please share! I'd be much glad to go deeper and more diverse into this world.

Both of them I met on dating apps. L is from Kenya and lives and works in Kuwait, A is in Nigeria.

Both of them videocalled with me constantly so I know they are the person in their images. I have both of them on WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok. I have snooped enough on social media to confirm that most of what they have told me about their life seems to be true, more so for L than A. I have confirmed close family members and friends for both of them via Social Media.

L had roommates in the calls with her so I ""met"" them, and A had relatives, and ""introduced"" me to her Mum, Sister and Brother. Mum was less than a minute, Sister was twice, both less than a minute, but she was in the background of the calls when they were happening and I have her on FB and Tiktok too. Brother was just like 5 seconds, ""hello"" and wave.

A seems to have a more comfortable life, and buys nice shoes and clothes from the store when she goes. L seems to be in a poor economic position.

Both are absolutely gorgeous, that goes without saying. But they're not fake images, they're really them.

I never confirmed L's home address, but I confirmed her place of work. It's a coffee shop. I have the coffee ship's IG, where L can be seen working on their videos, and I have their street address in Kuwait. A actually gave me her address for some reason, and it checks out. I've looked on Google Maps and checked both the home itself and other locations in the area against videos and pictures she's sent me, so it seems to be her real address.

L chatted for 6 weeks, being semi-flirty but more reserved, saying she liked me but was unsure about what she wanted. After 6 weeks, she hit me with, ""my Mum is sick and needs to go to hospital, can you lend me $60 so I can send her?"" She uses PayPal as her method of choice. I'll be honest, because I assumed that videocalling would rule out a romance scam, I did send the money to L, but even as I did so the red flags were going up for me. L became super distant after that and never asked for more. Maybe I asked too many questions, idk.

With A, she came after L, and I was upfront at the start that I wouldn't give any money, and told her about L. She didn't object at all. She chatted for 2 weeks, going hard with the love bombing and ""I love you"" and nicknames and future talk and ""when will you visit me"" etc etc. After 2 weeks it was, ""what would you do if I disappear offline?"", then ""my data bundle is up today and I can't afford to renew it"". And then emotional manipulation, ""you said you wouldn't care if I was gone for weeks and weeks"". And after disappearing for a day (blatantly blocking me on WhatsApp to create the illusion of being offline, even though I can tell the difference), she came back with, ""I had to spend money from X for a bit of data"" and ""you don't care about me, you don't care if I disappear, you won't even give me money for data"". She wanted me to use Remitly. I didn't send her money.

So... Yeah. They just blatantly use their own identity and still go for romance scams. I don't even know how to think about that. It makes online dating that much harder, I guess.",3,1751134869.0,Romancescam,1,1.0,False

Today, they are gorgeous, art-filled volumes that highlight food as both culture and creative expression. Let‚Äôs explore how cuisine books have transformed over time, with interesting tidbits, milestones, and the digital turns that make them a staple of our kitchens and libraries.**

¬†

**üè∫ 1. The Humble Origins: Handwritten Recipe Collections**

**Before printing, cooking knowledge was passed on orally or recorded in manuscript notebooks, often cherished family heirlooms.**

* **Fact: One of the earliest recipe books,** ***Apicius*** **(4th‚Äì5th century AD), focused on Roman banquet menus and ingredients‚Äîmostly exotic spices and sauces.**
* **These handwritten compilations were prized for their personalization, scribbles, and scene-relative modifications‚Äîan implicit narrative of daily life and experimentation.**

¬†

**üñ®Ô∏è 2. The Printing Press Revolution: Mass-Circulating Cuisine**

**The invention of the printing press in the 15th century changed everything. Cookbooks started circulating beyond exclusive circles.**

* **1498:** ***De Honesta Voluptate et Valetudine*****, by Bartolomeo Platina, became one of the first printed cookbooks, covering Italian and Roman medieval recipes.**
* **The 17th-century French** ***Le Viandier*** **and** ***Le Cuisinier Fran√ßois*** **by La Varenne became foundational texts for modern French cuisine, moving from medieval excess to more refined techniques.**

¬†

**üåç 3. Era of Etiquette: Cookbooks for Gentlefolk**

**In the 18th and 19th centuries, cookbooks developed etiquette sections‚Äîmenus, hosting tips, and ingredient sourcing.**

* **International Influence: Mrs. Beeton‚Äôs** ***Book of Household Management*** **(1861) sold over 2 million copies and included recipes and domestic advice for well-to-do Victorian families.**
* **Tea Time: The rise of afternoon tea in Britain led to specialized tea cookbooks, featuring delicate pastries and sandwich instructions.**

¬†

**üé® 4. The Age of Visuals: Illustrations & Photography**

**The late 19th and early 20th centuries introduced food illustrations and photography in cookbooks.**

* **Julia Child‚Äôs** ***Mastering the Art of French Cooking*** **(1961) is a cultural turning point, blending clear instructions with engaging personality and resorting to illustrations to guide the reader.**
* **Julia‚Äôs Quote:**

**‚ÄúWith enough butter anything is good.‚Äù**

**Cookbooks transformed from purely instructional manuals to culinary storybooks.**

¬†

**üìö 5. Thematic & Regional Cuisine Books**

**By late 20th century, cookbook genres expanded across regions and themes:**

* **International Flavor: Madhur Jaffrey‚Äôs** ***An Invitation to Indian Cooking*** **(1973) and Claudia Roden‚Äôs Middle Eastern volumes introduced authentic regional dishes to home kitchens.**
* **Health & Dietary Focus: Vegan, gluten-free, and paleo cookbooks became mainstream in the 1990s and 2000s, reflecting increasing dietary awareness and lifestyle shifts. You can also find some of the best culinary and cuisine books from TrueGether, the best** [**eBay alternative.**](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html)

¬†

**üñåÔ∏è 6. Design as Art: The Coffee Table Cookbook**

**The rise of luxury visuals brought cookbooks to living rooms as d√©cor.**

* **Awards & Recognition: Books like** ***Noma*** **by Ren√© Redzepi (2010) and** ***Jerusalem*** **by Ottolenghi and Tamimi (2012) received culinary world and design acclaim, vying for design and photography awards.**
* **They balance recipes, cultural storytelling, beautiful photography, and design aesthetics, transforming cookbooks into objet d‚Äôart.**

¬†

**üåê 7. The Digital Turn: eBooks, Blogs & Cooking Apps**

**The internet reinvented recipe access‚Äîblogs, eBooks, mobile apps, and user-generated content became dominant.**

* **Sally‚Äôs Baking Addiction and Serious Eats exemplify current successful food blogging that merges narrative, tips, and professional insights.**
* **eCookbooks & Apps: Customizable meal plans, ingredient scaling, interactive checklists, and embedded videos transformed recipe consumption from passive reading to immersive cooking.**

¬†

**‚úçÔ∏è 8. Personalization & Niche Genres**

**Today‚Äôs cookbook market is diverse and hyper-focused:**

* **Diet-Specific: Keto, vegan, Mediterranean, etc.**
* **Local Producers: Books featuring farmer‚Äôs market ingredients or foraging for wild foods.**
* **Culture and Identity: Memoir-cookbooks like** ***In Bibi‚Äôs Kitchen*** **(2018) combine personal stories with communal recipes.**

¬†

**üçΩÔ∏è 9. The Future: AI, Sustainability, & Experience**

**What might the next era bring?**

* **AI-powered recipe customization suggests meal planning based on dietary preference, purchase history, and even pantry contents.**
* **Augmented Reality (AR) cooking lessons may be in the pipeline.**
* **Eco-consciousness: Cookbooks focusing on zero-waste, foraging, and regenerative cooking are gaining traction in response to environmental crises.**

**üìñ The Role of Women in Early Cuisine Books**

**Historically, many of the earliest cookbooks were written by or attributed to men‚Äîespecially in aristocratic or professional kitchens. However, it was women who truly drove the home-cooking revolution through their contributions to domestic guides and recipe manuals.**

**In the 18th and 19th centuries, domestic cookbooks written by women gained popularity. One landmark text was Amelia Simmons‚Äô** ***American Cookery*** **(1796)‚Äîthe first cookbook written by an American for Americans. It focused on local ingredients like cornmeal and pumpkin, setting a precedent for future regional cuisine books.**

**As literacy rates among women increased, handwritten family recipe collections became common. Passed down through generations, they included more than just recipes‚Äîfamily stories, household tips, and health remedies were often scribbled in the margins. These personal touches helped transform cookbooks into living documents of culinary and cultural heritage.**

¬†

**üß≥ Cookbooks as Cultural Preservation Tools**

**Cookbooks are more than culinary tools‚Äîthey are vessels of cultural identity. In communities facing migration, colonization, or diaspora, cuisine books serve as anchors to heritage.**

**For example, many immigrants brought handwritten or oral recipes with them to new lands. Over time, cookbooks compiled from these traditions helped preserve their authentic cultural practices. Some iconic examples include:**

* ***The Settlement Cookbook*** **(1901) ‚Äî Designed for Jewish immigrants in Milwaukee, it taught not only cooking but also American customs.**
* ***The Taste of Country Cooking*** **(1976) by Edna Lewis ‚Äî Celebrated African-American southern cuisine with deeply personal stories from Virginia's Piedmont region.**

**In today‚Äôs globalized world, cuisine books play a vital role in protecting and celebrating endangered foodways‚Äîfrom Indigenous American dishes to Syrian street food. Many such books act as forms of culinary resistance, ensuring that traditional methods and ingredients are not erased by modernization or cultural homogenization.**

¬†

**üõí The Rise of Influencer Cookbooks & Retail Trends**

**With the popularity of Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, a new breed of cookbook authors has emerged‚Äîsocial media influencers and food bloggers. These authors often begin with a digital following and later transition into publishing.**

* **Chrissy Teigen‚Äôs** ***Cravings*** **series, for instance, combined comfort food with celebrity appeal and personal anecdotes.**
* **Tieghan Gerard‚Äôs** ***Half Baked Harvest*****, a blog turned best-selling book, blends accessible recipes with stylish photography aimed at millennials and Gen Z home cooks.**

**Retailers have taken note of this trend. Cookbooks are now not just sold in bookstores but prominently featured in lifestyle stores, kitchen supply outlets, and even clothing boutiques. Eye-catching covers, glossy pages, and social-media-ready images have turned cookbooks into giftable lifestyle items, often outselling even literary bestsellers in certain seasons.**

¬†

**üì≤ How Digital Platforms Influence Cookbook Trends**

**The digital world has done more than just provide eBooks. It's reshaped how readers interact with cookbooks:**

* **Interactive formats: Some digital cookbooks offer real-time ingredient adjustments, step-by-step videos, or voice commands.**
* **Online communities: Platforms like Reddit‚Äôs** r/Old_Recipes **and Instagram hashtags like #VintageCookbooks have created passionate online cookbook fans who share photos, stories, and reviews.**
* **Self-publishing tools: Services like Amazon KDP and Blurb allow chefs, home cooks, and even families to publish their own recipe collections without traditional publishing houses‚Äîdemocratizing the process.**

**This shift has led to a more inclusive and diverse range of cookbooks available today, often centered around underrepresented communities or highly niche diets.**

¬†

**üç≤ Interesting Facts About Cookbooks**

**Here are a few fun facts to add flavor to your blog:**

* **üìö The Guinness World Record for the most expensive cookbook is held by** ***The Art of Cuisine*** **by Salvador Dal√≠, priced at over $5,000.**
* **üî• The term ‚Äúcookbook‚Äù was first used in the 1800s, but before that, they were often called receipt books.**
* **üåê In 2020 alone, over 17,000 cookbooks were published worldwide, a testament to their enduring popularity‚Äîeven during a digital revolution.**
* **üìñ Some cookbooks contain deliberate errors or unique code words to detect plagiarism‚Äîa trick used by authors as early as the 1700s.**

**üåü Final Thoughts**

**From handwritten notes to lavish art pieces and interactive experiences, cuisine books have evolved alongside our culinary curiosity and cultural exchange. Whether you cherish a vintage manual from the 1800s or scroll a featured recipe on your tablet, cookbooks remain enduring vessels of taste, identity, and inspiration.**

Like life really is a simulation and my program doesn't include romance or extended relationships.

With the exclusion of one friend from college, women always stop talking to me. Often abruptly.

Let me walk through a few:

Sophomore year of college the girls across the hall pranked our dorm door with sticky notes. This went back and forth for a little bit before my roommate and I put up a sign inviting them to knock on the door. I'd also put my Snapchat name on the sign. The invitation worked. We talked for literally like two minutes tops. One of the girls even added my Snapchat.

She sent me one snap which I didn't see because I didn't have wifi when it was sent. When I got back home I replied once explaining I was out and she blocked me. Every time we saw each other around campus after that she would walk faster and avoid eye contact. I never said a single word to her or any of her roommates after she blocked me. I figured only bad things could come of that.

Fast forward years later. I'm working a job with autistic kids. I move cases around until I get a permanent one. I'm put on the case first and told I'll get a partner in a few weeks. I get a partner and she's someone I met once before. I pegged her as a shy little queer chick and didn't think much more of her.

She started off quiet but as we worked more she started to talk to me about her personal life and was asking me all kinds of things. I decided to try to match her energy. She eventually started asking me about my past relationships and told me how I was the coolest coworker she had met.

Eventually she told me she was quitting the job to pursue other things. So I painted her picture as a goodbye gift. She had my number but I didn't have hers, so I figured if she liked the gift and wanted to stay connected she'd text me after she quit.

It turned out she was quitting a day earlier than I thought so I told her about the painting and she came by my place to pick it up after work. When she got it she asked me if I still wanted to be friends even though we wouldn't be working together anymore. I told her yes. She texted me when she got home to show me she hung up the painting.

We texted back and forth but I waited a few days before trying to make plans. We settled on grabbing coffee on a Saturday. She was busy for a week but we kept texting. The Wednesday before our coffee meet up she stopped texting me in the middle of our conversation.

Never heard from her again after that. Reached out a few times over some months and that was a wrap.

My luck on dating apps is horrible. Barely get any matches and when I do, it always ends the same. I try not to jump in too fast. Try to have actual conversation and then either stop getting replies or get unmatched. My profile is upfront about wanting something serious. I only match with women that say the same thing.

My most recent L, I tried switching things up. Didn't jump in thirsty. However I did cut the small talk quicker than usual. I asked about intentions. We had an exchange and seemed to be on the same page. I described a specific type of scenario for my intentions and then she unmatched.

Can't seem to win.

Unless I have things completely wrong and need to be ""thirstier"" in my approach. I see the complaints women have about the way certain guys act and avoid doing those things.

Thing is, I don't want to be a thirsty guy. That's not who I am. I don't think I can be that kind of guy.

There's other things but the post is long enough as is.",2,1751134739.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False
1lmtk9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1lmtk9l/worried_about_what_could_come_of_this/,Worried about what could come of this,"I'm 18 years old, almost 19, and I have two friends, one nevermo and one exmo like me, 19 and 20 respectively, they're dating each other. My concern is that we're friends with a girl who just recently turned 16 and we thought was a TBM. Turns out she's been questioning her faith recently and is now PIMO. We were all together for her birthday party at the mall when she told us she wanted to try coffee for the first time. Our nevermo friend gasped and hugged her and told her they were so proud of her. (I was proud of her as well but I didn't want to influence her in any way) This nevermo friend used to argue with me about the church all the time when I was a TBM and seems even more against the church than both me and his exmo partner. 

I was the one paying for drinks so I bought the girl a coffee and our nevermo friend started asking her questions and debating with her about faith. This pood girl is going through a really hard time. She still believes in Christianity and was really just struggling with the church itself. I think this was probably due to when my shelf was breaking I would share my findings in our group chat. 

If she was 18+ I would probably not be as worried about this, but this girl has only just turned 16 and is still part of a Mormon family. I tried to stress to her that we love her no matter what and we're not trying to pressure her to feel any certain way about the church. And that we're not trying to tell her to disobey her parents. But I'm not sure that she understood me.

Did I do something wrong? Ik me being an adult and her being a minor can be troublesome, but I'm more worried about her getting hurt/losing her community. She's always been so sweet and I don't want her being hurt.

TLDR: I was careless and fed this girl anti-church content and might have ruined her life if things go bad with her family when she attempts to leave mormonism fully.

I‚Äôm not big on crash diets or extreme weight loss gimmicks, but I kept seeing detox teas pop up, so I gave one a try. For the record, I **wasn‚Äôt expecting to lose 10 pounds overnight**. I just wanted something gentle to help me reset a bit.

**The tea I used had a blend with things like dandelion, ginseng, and other herbs**. It didn‚Äôt taste bad at all, and it wasn‚Äôt one of those extreme laxative teas that leave you in the bathroom for half the day. I drank it every evening for a few weeks.

**What actually changed**:

* I felt *less puffy* in the mornings
* I didn‚Äôt have as many cravings late at night
* My digestion felt smoother, like things were just moving better
* My belly looked flatter, especially when I woke up

Now let‚Äôs be clear: **I didn‚Äôt drop 10 pounds**, and I think people expecting that are going to be disappointed. But the scale did shift by about 2-3 pounds, and honestly, I *felt* like I‚Äôd lost more just from the bloat relief alone.

I also noticed I was drinking more water, which probably helped a lot. This tea didn‚Äôt have caffeine, so I liked using it instead of a late-night coffee or snack.

Would I recommend it? If you're just looking to feel a little lighter and help your gut along without doing anything drastic, **this kind of tea might be a helpful sidekick**. But it‚Äôs not magic.

I'm finally getting the chill weekend in I've been craving for so long: no plans and unrestricted free time :)

I'd love to spend the day chatting with a nice F who can hold her own in a conversation. It can just be today, or even long-term if we click!

So far, I've slept in, got an iced coffee, watched a show on Netflix, and now I'm going to spend the rest of the afternoon gaming or working on some of my hobbies. It's raining out (as it often has lately on weekends here in the northeast), which is the perfect excuse to just stay in, chill, and catch up on some of the things that makes me happy.

My friends would describe me as a bit of a goofball. I like to laugh and joke around, but I can always be there when they need me and talk about more serious stuff. I have a big heart and genuinely care about the people who matter the most to me.

I'm a weird blend of athletic and competitive, while also light hearted and nerdy. I love a good hazy IPA on a weekend and trying new food/recipes. I love good weather and being outdoors, but also love a good chill day in on a rainy day like today. I have a really active social life, but I also need me-time. Balance is key :)

If you're interested in chatting, DM me with a quick intro about yourself. How would your friends describe you? How's your day going so far? And what are some of the things that make you happy or drive you to be who you are?

1lmti8s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmti8s,Mini roses doing okay atm but not thriving,"Helloo! So those are my miniature roses, they‚Äôre all different types from what I‚Äôve seen, but I‚Äôm not really experienced so I need your advice please. I bought most of them around 3 weeks ago, but the two at the front in the ceramic pot are from around april-march. I have to say that it is the first time I‚Äôve been able to keep mini roses alive for this long and I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything for them, but they seem to not be thriving anyway, except for the one that is currently blooming, he seems to be doing better, but not the best. I repotted them in a mixture of soil that I made myself after some research and I would say that it is pretty draining and breathable. I added some dried coffee grounds for the acidity and some eggshells when repotting as well. I even designed and 3D printed the white pot myself in order to maximize drainage. I also experienced with the lighting and found that the way to go with them (at least where I‚Äôm staying) is a plant lamp, because all my windows are south facing, which in theory should be great, but i found that the sun is too strong and burns and dries their leaves. As for watering, I always water them when the soil is completely dry at the top and I also check the moisture at the bottom of the pot with a skewer. Sometimes I even spray them a little with a special booster. So now, my question is, why do they always get 2-3 yellowing leaves but new growth at the same time as well? Also, as you can see, the flowers are really small too. I have to admit that I didn‚Äôt really use fertilizer when watering them, but that‚Äôs also because I‚Äôve read somewhere that you should stop fertilizing for approximately 4 weeks after repotting. The one blooming right now surprises me the most anyway because it seems to be doing better than the rest, but I don‚Äôt know why. I am in no position to plant them outside either.

That used to be my Ecoflow delta mini, I was able to easily charge my laptop which meant more time between coffee shops and I was able to buy a portable 12v fridge. Then I hard mounted solar panels to my roof rack so my battery was always charged. Unfortunately back in August last year my vehicle was broken into and everything I own was stolen down to my pillow. I thought that was it for me I started renting a room again but after tasting that kind of freedom it‚Äôs hard to go back to 4 walls. I spent 3 months rebuilding my setup ground up with everything I had learned in 7 years of car life and then another 6 months refining, adding, removing, replacing, fixing. But it was one thing at a time months apart:

* Insulation
* Solid, lightweight, low to the frame platform
* DIY 4.1kW lithium iron phosphate battery
* Diesel heater
* Hard mounted rooftop solar (before I even had a solar charge controller)
* Power inverter
* Upgraded cooking
* Upgraded slatted mattress frame¬†

They were all months apart as I was able to save money but they all built on the last. For me it‚Äôs been this long slow sort of painful process: building a DIY battery, running it with no panels, then finally adding solar, a proper inverter, better cooking gear and eventually a monitor on a swing arm.

The monitor is new but weirdly it made everything before it snap into place. Like the rig was waiting for that piece. Starting out car life it's all about survival, solving immediate needs, fighting the discomfort. I started in a 2007 Honda Civic with a towel as a pillow and a sleeping bag sleeping in the drivers seat for nearly a year. It was fun but it was also miserable that was one of the hardest times in my life.¬†

It‚Äôs got me wondering what was your puzzle piece? The one that made the rest of the system feel like it clicked.

I live in Utah and am an active PIMO in my LDS ward. Not even my TBM wife knows I'm PIMO. I say that to state that the opinions I hear most often about what it means to live ""authentically"" is always negative, and it's essentially just the person saying they don't want anyone else telling them how to live their life. The parable of the Prodigal Son gets thrown around a lot in connection with it. But I don't agree with that idea. 

To me, being authentic means you aren't hiding who you are. It can take multiple forms, and there are many positive Christian and Mormon scriptural examples of people living authentically: 1) Jesus Christ, 2) Shadrach, Meshack, and Abednego (sorry if I misspelled those) choosing not to bow down to the idol, 3) Daniel choosing to openly continue praying to God instead of the king, 4) the sons of Mosiah choosing to preach to the Lamanites because they couldn't stand the thought of anyone perishing spiritually even though everyone around them told them not to do it, etc. 

The difference I think is that being authentic and living your truth in my culture are often seen as trying to give yourself license to sin. To be truly authentic, the only identity that really matters is that you're a child of God. I agree with that part. What others don't realize is that not being authentic means only living a half life where you don't feel safe to show up completely for things. You're always holding some part of yourself back in all of your relationships because you're worried about not fitting in or of being hurt psychologically, spiritually, or physically. You're always wearing a mask, only playing a part, and never get to live fully. While then choosing to live fully could involve doing some things that might be a sin in some cultures, like getting a tattoo,  choosing to try drinking alcohol or coffee to see what it's like for yourself, or even wearing a dress instead of a suit and tie, those things don't define you. In the Trans space, living authentically means letting everyone see the real you, consequences be damned, and that can take many different forms depending on the level or form of transition we want or are able to do. And that should be a good thing, shouldn't it? Now you get to know the real me instead of this mask I've worn my whole life. 

I think I'll close with something my wife has quoted a few times to me and my kids. It's a line from the kids show Daniel Tiger, ""You can change your hair or what you wear, but no matter what you do, you're still you."" So be you, not what everyone else thinks you should be.
