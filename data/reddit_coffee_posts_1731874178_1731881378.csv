I'll skip all the nitty gritty details about what happened, but was amazed at the professionalism and kind / caring / hard-working nature of all the staff, nurses, doctors, workers, technicians, etc. there. I'm very thankful. 

I'd like to personally do something nice for them, but not sure what to do exactly.

I was thinking of going to the ER one evening with donuts or pizza, but is that weird and would they even accept outside food? Then I was thinking of just loading up like $200-$500 into a Tim Hortons gift-card and giving it to the triage nurse and asking her to use it as cash to get coffees / foods. Is there anything else I should do that's better?

If there's anybody here who works at the Milton ER who could let me know what they'd want, that'd be great!",2,1731881158.0,Milton,0,1.0,False

1gtoufn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relocating/comments/1gtoufn/need_relocating_ideas/,Need Relocating Ideas!,"Hey y'all! Like alot of people in this sub, me and my SO am looking to leave Florida for a blue state sometime in the next year. We like many parts of Florida, such as the beaches and the cities, however we don't like the attitudes. Thus, we are looking for somewhere new. Me and my SO enjoy nature and hiking. I lived in Colorado for a short time and we both like the state but are worried about the cost of living. I don't really like Denver though, and I do think food in Colorado is pretty bad (I'm spoiled from growing up in the deep South). I have always wanted to live in the Pacific Northwest or North California, but we are concerned about COL and seasonal depression. My SO is very interested in Vermont, but I am not sure about being so far from a major city. I've also never been to New England, but I do think I would probably like Boston. I love hippie towns, mountain towns, beach towns, and towns with charm. 

I have lived in several different places, so here is a list of the cities and towns I have lived in or spent alot of time in and enjoyed:

\- Tampa, FL (my favorite place I've lived)

\- Nashville, TN

\- Estes Park, CO

\- Mount Dora, FL

\- Austin, TX

\- St. Pete, FL

\- San Antonio, TX

\- Amarillo, TX

My SO loves Huntsville, AL, Nashville, TN, and Asheville, NC. 

Here is our must have list:

\- Be relatively close to a big city (we are okay with living in a small or mid-size town that is less than 2 hrs or so from a major city)

\- Blue state

\- Close to nature or has good parks and lots of trees

\- Can afford to live in city on an engineer's salary

\- Cool town with some things to do. Doesn't have to have amazing nightlife, but does need vibey coffee shops, relatively good restaurants, cute bookshops, community events, etc.

I like making food, but usually I dont put too much effort into it because it’s «just for me». When I have friends and such over for a visit I always love to really get into it and make good meals and fix up desserts and stuff, and I make food into stupid hearts and smileys and everything.

He is getting his PhD and I'm getting my masters full-time and working part-time.
We have an issue with housework.. which is I do probably 80% of it and he does 20%. He buys 90% of the food and I either cook or heat it up etc.
Lately I've been extremely stressed with my responsibilities in my masters program and working part time. And when I'm home relaxing which isn't often my bf will do things he knows bothers me like he will slurp his coffee or drink loudly right next to me repeatedly which drive me crazy, like it's so loud that he could only be doing it deliberately. I've told him at least 20x that the sound really bothers me and i hate it and we have had fights about it before. He will also do stuff like jokingly call me fat or remind me that I haven't been to the gym as much as he has when I told him that really bothers me and I've struggled with orthorexia and anorexia in the past and it's extremely triggering for me. He says he's just kidding but him bringing up my lack of gym attendance when I'm struggling to stay afloat from work and school really rubs me the wrong way. I'm not overweight by any means ..but he still says I don't workout like him. Which really bothers me because I'II come home late from and he will have already went to the gym and worked out but he doesn't have any dinner figured out even though so l have to figure it out. Lately l've been feeling exhausted from dating him. I pay my own bills, we split rent 50/50. The only thing he pays for is food which he eats most of it since I really don't eat much. But he will always mention how I don't cook..
I cook 2times weekly because that's all I can handle with my schedule.
This past week I had the worst week ever at my job with an issue l've never experienced before. I've been so stressed all week and today he kept slurping to get a reaction from me and I started crying and screaming because he knows how stressed I am and he just seems to add to it and not care about my stress levels.

# Established Items

* **Pig Blood Stew** (Q1 / Passive)
   * *Taste of life*
   * Pools: Treasure, Devil
   * Effect: Killing an enemy will leave a pool of blood creep that lasts for 3 seconds.
   * Origin: Based off Dinuguan, a Filipino dish made out of diced pork and pork blood. In the Bible as stated in Leviticus 17:12-14:
      * ^(12) Therefore I say to the Israelites, “None of you may eat blood, nor may any foreigner residing among you eat blood.” ^(13) “‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among you who hunts any animal or bird that may be eaten must drain out the blood and cover it with earth, ^(14) because the life of every creature is its blood. That is why I have said to the Israelites, “You must not eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who eats it must be cut off.”
* **Blood Transfusion** (Trinket)
   * *Leeching life force*
   * Effect: Stepping on hostile blood creep heals Isaac instead of damaging him.
   * Trivia: Jehovah's Witnesses prohibit blood transfusions. Yes, even during life-threatening scenarios.
* **Excommunication Letter** (Q? / Passive)
   * *You've been disfellowshipped!*
   * Pools: Red Chest, Curse, Devil
   * Costume: X on Isaac's face (you get a cookie if you get the reference)
   * Effect:
      * Locks you out of Cathedral/Chest & Angel Rooms.
      * Devil Deals cost 1 heart less. The Lost instead gets 1 extra choice between all Devil Deal items.
* **Paraphernalia Protection** (Q3 / Passive)
   * *Locked away from the evils of this world*
   * Pools: Angel
   * Effect: Major Arcana, Magic: The Gathering cards and certain items will no longer be obtainable. If Isaac attempts to pick one up:
      * Mom's Hand attempts to grab Isaac.
      * Gain a Tears Up for each ""demonic"" item attempted: 0.25 for the first 5 in the run, 0.10 for the rest.
      * Unobtainable items: Mr. Dolly, The Gamekid (feel free to comment more)
   * Origin: The intro of the game itself. Additionally, parents have burned Smurf, MTG and Pokemon merch due to in fear of being demonic
* **First Vision** (Q4 / Passive)
   * *I see it in front of me*
   * Pools: Angel
   * Effect: Blind items (alt path items) will be revealed and rerolled to Q2+. Curse of the Blind will be removed if present (and will no longer be encountered for the rest of the run).
   * Origin: [Joseph Smith's theophany.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Vision)
* **Seer Stone** (Q3 / Passive)
   * *Recovering lost scriptures*
   * Pools: Angel
   * Costume: White top hat blocking Isaac’s face (but does not affect tears)
   * Effect: Curse of the Lost/Amnesia will be lifted, and they will be removed from the rest of the run.
   * Origin: [The stone believed to translate the Book of Mormon.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_(Latter_Day_Saints))
* **10% Tithe** (Q? / Passive)
   * *Church taxes*
   * Pools: Angel, Treasure
   * Effect:
      * Upon going down a new floor, subtract 10% of your coins.
      * Gain the following damage bonus on each floor: (coins \* 0.1) \* 0.25.
      * Having less than 10 coins will give Isaac -2.5 damage instead (does not stack).
* **Cyan-Aid** (Q3 / Passive)
   * *Drink the dogma*
   * Pools: Devil, Angel, Shop(?)
   * Effect: Restock but for Angel/Devil deals. However, Isaac gains Broken Hearts the same amount as the cost of that Devil Deal. Angel Deals will give 1-4 broken hearts depending on the item quality (1 broken heart for Q0). The Lost will instead have one extra Devil/Angel Deal before he can no longer take any.
   * Origin: Based off the [mass suicide in Jonestown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown), which was associated with the Peoples Temple. This is where the term ""Drinking the Kool-Aid"" came from. Despite the term, it was actually grape Flavor-Aid. (Also, the sprite I have in mind has a cyan color, because, you know. *Cyan*ide.)

I'm a newbie to the world of super automatic coffee machines and I'm looking for some advice. I've been using a Nespresso Pixie, but I'm ready to upgrade.

Here are the models I'm currently considering:

- Miele 6160
- Bosch 800 Series
- DeLonghi Dinamica Plus
- DeLonghi Eletta Explore
- KitchenAid (specific model if you have one in mind)

Key factors for me:

- Drink quality: While I'm not a coffee snob, I'm looking for a machine that can consistently produce good-tasting coffee.
- Ease of cleaning: I'm willing to put in the work, but I'm looking for removable brew units and dishwasher-safe parts.
- Reliability: A machine that will last.
- Aesthetics: A sleek design that complements my kitchen.

I'm not interested in Jura machines due to their aesthetic. Simply personal choice! Just don’t love their look.

Budget: Around $2000, but I'm open to going slightly over for the right machine.

Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

If you're looking to adopt an introverted homebody who enjoys reading and writing (I'm in the process of publishing a series of fantasy books), video games (PC and Switch though I've had experience with many consoles), and, more recently, strength conditioning at the gym I'd love to hear from you!

I'm pretty dry-witted and sarcastic, love a bit of friendly ribbing, on the cynical and pessimistic side (it's the tortured artist in me), centre-left in terms of politics, slow to trust but extremely loyal and passionate once I've been won over. I also have an adorable tabby cat with white socks I'm happy to share pics of upon request. 

We can start off seeing how we vibe through DMs and hopefully come to a point where we can move it to in-person meets if things go well. Happy to grab coffee or a bite to eat, visit museums, go bowling/skating, etc. So long as it gets me out and about. Much as I love my international friendships I would at least prefer for you to be in a reasonable distance to London though I don't mind commuting so long as it doesn't come with a hefty train price, haha.",3,1731880006.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I took a break from these when Jan got back on MTV bc I didn’t want to give her attention, but now that she has blown that, let’s get to recappin’! 

Jan feeling cute w coffee:

I should admit that my coffee palate is not that developed. I can tell the difference between office drip coffee, Starbucks coffee, and my pour over, and I much prefer the latter. But I’m not tasting peachiness, nuttiness, etc. I think “clarity” is the right word for why I like my pour over best. 

80% of the time, I make a single cup for myself. 19% of the time, I make two cups for me and a guest. And 1% of the time, I make 4ish cups for guests (had to include it). I tend to use lighter roasts. 

I know this sounds extremely lazy, but I would really like to automate my process - push a couple of buttons and have some coffee. 

I’m down to the Aiden and Ode 2, xBloom, and Gevi 4-in-1. To be honest, I think I’ve gone too far down the rabbit hole and read too much. I’m assuming I’ll be happy with any of the three (could be wrong). But it’s enough money that I’m posting this before pulling the trigger. 

The Aiden and Ode combo seems built for more than one cup at a time (my 80% use case). The xBloom won’t do my 20% use case of 2 or more cups. The Gevi seems like it hits my 99%, and I’ll need to use the Chemex for the 4 or more people use case. 

So I’m leaning towards the Gevi. 

Any advice would be appreciated. 

Also, the other equipment won’t be wasted. About once every couple of weeks, I make an espresso-based drink with my Flair 58. I will still use the grinder, kettle, and scale for that. And yes, I started with a very manual setup for everything. I enjoyed the process. ",1,1731879891.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1gtojl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1gtojl1/i_was_doing_well_but_feel_a_panic_attack_coming_on/,"I was doing well, but feel a panic attack coming on.","I guess I focused on myself a little too much. Maybe when we obsess over thoughts about them it’s our brains working things out. Maybe obsessive intrusive thoughts about them are a form of healthy therapy as crazy as that sounds. I went so long with not thinking about her or situations that when I finally did I started feeling overwhelmed and lightheaded and panicky. It really is a horror story what we’ve went through. Specifically the thoughts that haunt me are the simple times when I first noticed her interests changing and her having no problem expressing these new interests of the replacement like watching the simpsons, drinking coffeee when she always expressed not being a coffee drinker, or her new knowledge of cars. Then the worst of all is the times I presented her evidence of there being someone new. Of her having sex with someone new. It’s crazy how I feel bad for her when I find evidence. Something as simple as finding a bloody period towel on her messed bed during her time of the month and calmly asking her, “hey, what’s this?” (The towel she got fucked on during her period of you couldn’t guess btw) her reply, “a dirty towel” followed by an instant robotic blank. Watching her like an empty shell hooking her dog to her leash. Looking left, then right. Looking through things as I just watch. Knowing she was caught and knowing the emotional turmoil and terror inside her. Destroying her and knowing she doesn’t know how to handle it or what to do. That accountability isn’t the answer. Finally after I watch and follow her for long enough, I say, “Please look at me.” And when she does, I have enough love in me to say, “Although I’m hurt because you made me think the word “love” meant we don’t do this, You gave me respect by not labeling us.” And she was back in an instant. Witty and firing back. The blankness gone. “You think that was period blood from having sex? You’re insane! The last person I had sex with was you! You are really sick in the head! That was red hair dye!” I just didn’t answer. These memories haunt me. Trying to make sense out of such an illness for someone you love. They haunt me so much. Watching these people operate on a different spectrum of reality and time. Loving them. I shake in bed as tears roll down my face. Not for how I was hurt. How I can’t get through to her. How I can’t reach the wounded inner child I so often see behind the fog. That I can’t save her. That no one can. The inability to love or be loved. It has to be the worst thing in this planet and it’s happening to someone I care for deeply. Potentially all because her stepfather repeatedly raped her as a very little girl. Such evil resulting in the absence of love. Where is God in all this? The being of endless mercy and love. What does he think? Idk what this post even is, but I haven’t been thinking about her and then I did. It was overwhelming. I much rather obsess over thought of her all day to soften the blow of a shaking overwhelming panic attack like this again. My God, why did we have to learn such a thing existed. I wish I could erase my memories. ",1,1731879863.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1gtoga4,https://www.reddit.com/r/hygiene/comments/1gtoga4/update_90_of_people_dont_have_good_hygiene/,UPDATE: 90% of people don’t have good hygiene FORGIVE THE SLOPPY WRITING I WAS RUSHING,"Hello, I was the OP for that post from a few hours ago. I got a lot of requests to drop my full hygiene routine. So here it is. I typed all of it up. 
Okay here is my hygiene routine, PURE hygiene nothing for the purpose of beauty. 
1. Food and coffee  before brushing teeth.  
2. Rinse with water
3. Scrape tongue. I use a reusable steel one and wash with warm water each time. You could also use a metal spoon or knife! Thjs is CRUCIAL to me bc  most people can’t reach the toothbrush all the way to the back of your throat. Even if you can, the scraper gets off WAY more. Thjs is a life changer! Scrap from BACK TO FRONT and don’t swallow that mucus
4. Rinse with water and spit out
5. Brush my teeth for 2 minutes 15-30 secs. 2 mins is recommended but 🤷‍♀️ then I brush my tongue for one minute. Maybe slight overkill on the tongue but that’s how I get the best smelling breath. Btw, I use a general anti cavity toothpaste in the morning, and a whitening focused one at night. The latter is less minty and doesn’t make my breath smell as fresh. 
6. Shower  next. I prefer to shower AFTER brushing my teeth bc that toothpaste and bacteria left around the mouth can cause acne. 
6.a) silicone loofahs dry quickly and don’t harbor bacteria the same way a regular one would. Those loofahs are NOT  recommended for use because of this. They never fully dry or get cleaned. I disinfect my silicone loofah every 2-3 uses, but it’s washed with hot water before and after every use anyways. A wash cloth works too! Just make sure to replace it after every use. 
6.b) I exfoliate my skin twice a week bc it gets my skin softer but I also feel cleaner bc I feel like it gets deeper, OPTIONAL just thought I’d add this. 
6.c) I wash my face in the shower twice (if at night, in the morning then once.) then I shampoo twice sometimes if I feel like I got really sweaty or dirty that day, like post workout. I DO wash my hair daily which is NOT a requirement, it just works best for MY hair because I have a naturally oily scalp. Realistically 1-3 days. More than 4 is gross, even if it’s not greasy on top, your hair has been touching things all day just like your clothes have. 
6.d) LADIES READ THIS!!  THIS IS SO IMPORTANT!!!  Every man I have ever been with has told me I have the BEST smelling vagina, and that the other women they’ve been with have had a tad fishy / general mustiness smell. HERE IS WHY!!! Yes your vagina IS self cleaning! You do NOT need to do anything to your vagina.  However your VULVA AND LABIA are NOT considered part of your vagina yet they SMELL like they are. It is perfectly ok for that area to come into contact with fragrance free soap! I get my bikini line and pubes too, this area of your body (same applies for men) doesn’t get any air bc it’s covered in layers AND in a crevice. Idc if you shave, just lather up that bush! Hair traps odor. I use dove unscented. Make sure you are getting the well forgotten area that leads to the back entrance… most people clean their buttholes but forget about this part. That area is musty too girl! We don’t want back shot air! Also, I ALWAYS use a wet wipe after pooping. Use a GENTLE one, the anti bacterial ones disrupt your rectum’s natural biome. You don’t need to go digging in there either! Wipe in concentric circles to push all the bacteria outwards and then go back in and clean it up with a piece of toilet paper. This will leave you smelling like roses down there, without disturbing any microbiomes. Don’t use ANYTHING fragranced back or front door. Do NOT use a douche. I prefer to keep my back and front door waxed so it does not trap odors and to avoid any possible dingleberries but this is not necessary. 
6.e) okay now, for showering.  I do have eczema so I don’t like to use a lot of really heavily scented things or overwash. My shower includes at LEAST scrubbing my armpits, vagina, butt, feet, face and hair (once again hair is different for everyone). I try to keep my armpits waxed to once again not trap odor. Most days I also go over my feet again with a Pumice stone since that’s how I’ve found to be the best way to get all that trapped dirt out. Also I really WASH my feet. I go in between toes, over and under.  

If I did HIT at the gym I will do a full body wash. Chest arms legs boobs butt cheeks back neck ears (I have a separate tool I use to get my back) everything. I try to only scrub my limbs every 2-3 days to avoid drying them out or over washing. 

7. When I’m out I dry myself off but leave arms and legs damp. I do my face skincare routine. Use a mineral oil free lotion followed by Vaseline body oil which is locking in the moisture of the lotion. 
8. Floss teeth YOU CANNKT SKIP THJS STEP!!!! AO MANY PPL DONT FLOSS PLZ STSRT FLOSSING!!
9. Get dressed use deodorant etc
10. Now it should have been at least 20 mins since you’ve brushed your teeth, so use mouth wash. Swish back and forth for 45-60 seconds, and then gargle in the back of your throat. Gargling makes it so much fresher. AVOID a mouthwash with alcohol, it will make your breath smells nice for a second but it dries out your mouth, eventually making it worse. I use therabreath, it’s like the Cadillac of mouth washes, but if you’re on a budget you could just use the UP and UP alcohol free one. do NOT BUY TBR EQUATE ONE IT FUCKINF SUCKS!! 
11. Idk if this counts as hygiene but I’ll add it anyways. I put lotion on my neck and then a little back of the Vaseline oil, and add a light perfume on top. For work I like to stick with a light, inoffensive smell. Nothing bold or crazy just something fresh smelling. 
12. After my lunch at work I like to floss and use mouthwash, since I’m getting up close and personal with patients. I’m wearing a face mask anyways but if I had a garlicky lunch they may still be able to smell it. 
Also, I have a retainer I wear at night. I brush it with a toothbrush and paste for 2 minutes.",0,1731879618.0,hygiene,3,0.5,False

I see that he calls Crowley back. He tries to make him stay and understand that he cannot talk freely because they are being watched by the Metatron because he does not want Crowley to leave, and he wants to get across that he is under threat. So he says ""work with me"", mouthed ""window, and then goes in about being angels in heaven and so on the keep appearance for the listening Metatron. Crowley immediately looks out the window. And stares and stares while Aziraphale is talking. Then he says the sentence: ""I don't think you understand what I am offering you"" , and then Crowley turns and says that he understands. Now I asked myself what this offer is. an I thought somebody else offered something here, the Metatron : coffee or death. And there needs to be a reason why there is a change of position of Azi and Crowley. What does Crowley see through the window? The Metatron probably. But what else?

I watched video in which you can see Aziraphale's shop. From the point Crowley is standing before he leaves, he can clearly see the two parts of the name of Nina's café, in big letters, spread across two houses. He glances outside, Aziraphale says ""I think you don't understand what I am offering you"", and Crowley finally turns towards him and says ""I understand"". Guess he understood now that this was what the Metatron was offering. Crowley saw him arrive with the coffee, if I remember clearly.

Context: I started taking Wellbutrin in the morning for the last 5 days. I used to be on Lexapro, but I found that it made me feel sluggish and made my inattentive ADHD worse. I was (and still am) feeling hopeful about trying Wellbutrin since it seemed clear I have a dopamine deficit and not a serotonin one. Since taking the medicine, I have felt more energy, but also my SI has gotten worse. I know this is common with antidepressants, and my doctor warned me sometimes you feel worse before you feel better, and the energy can increase before your mood does. I haven't ever had a plan and I never will, but I've been thinking of death and SI nonstop. I always think existentially and though I have a therapist help me with mindfulness, it's hard to escape these thoughts. Like if crisis mode was a 10, I felt like a 6 before the medication and now I feel like I toe between an 8 or a 9.

I got my right knee done on 9/11 and left knee on 11/13. Was it it close together? I don’t think so. But the saying that no two knee surgeries are the same is 100% true.  My left knee was scheduled for 2 pm so the nurse said I could have black coffee, jello, and Gatorade before 8 am. That morning they called and said the doctor wanted to move my surgery. Great. Did they? No!! I just say there until my surgery at 3pm. And to top it off PT went home before my surgery was finished so they had to admit me. 
Anyway, I got home the next day in the evening with no real pain meds and no icing of my knee. And definitely no sleep. I’ve spent the last few days trying to get ahead of the pain. The swelling is much worse. The pain is worse. But I am trying to change my mindset. The ice and elevation is not bringing down the inflammation.  I know this is a healing pain and both knees are done but I’m exhausted mentally and physically. I don’t know what to do. I’m sure that tomorrow will look brighter once I get used to the block being off.

1gtob28,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gtob28,Brisket on ironwood XL,"Ok boys — here’s how I did it and it was the best brisket I have ever done or had.

Bought an 18 lb USDA choice brisket from a local butcher - buckled it into my backseat (not even kidding - I have a photo for proof)


Let her sit out for 2 hours, then started trimming 

Trimmed it down to about 16.6lbs -  saved the best fat for rendering and tallow later

Used worst-than-your-sister sauce as binder and only the slightest bit on each side 

Set my Traeger Ironwood XL to 200 degrees and then set my brisket on top rack and let her roll; one temp probe in the fattest end of the flat

(^^5:30pm Saturday she went on the grill)

Realized after an hour that “200 degrees” on a Traeger means “220-230 degrees” in reality which was driving me nuts - so I knocked my temp setting down to 185….which kept the actual temp around 200-210…I find that interesting…I’ll look into that later. Let cook boys 

(8:00am Sunday - outdoor temp ~45 degrees all night)

Temp on brisket at this point was 160.  I needed to speed this the hell up…bumped up temp to 225 degrees 

(10:00 - hits 170 degrees)


Pulled brisket off, wrapped in unwaxed butcher paper and spritzed paper lightly w/apple cider vinegar


Put brisket back on top rack and turned up grill to 265 degrees 

12:15pm - brisket hits 205 on highest point of flat - probe tender all over - pulled off and set on butcher block inside my house - temp indoors 70 degrees 

Let stand until 1:45pm - temp got down to 150/149 degrees - couldn’t wait any longer - had fam over and waiting to eat (I wanted to wait until 140 degrees…oh well)

Sliced into it and it was so perfect.  Not even kidding…all of the fucking videos and websites…years of reading and learning…I finally did it. 

Let me tell you - this is my 11th brisket - 10 previous briskets were on my 22” kettle grill and manual love and labor every 2-3 hours all night long…and fucked every single one of them up in some way….

This brisket had such a nice smoke ring - smoke flavor - and soooo much flavor naturally.  I am so happy with how this turned out - hiit me up with any questions too - I want us all to succeed!

We are renovating our house and we sent a picture (to both sets of parents) of an almost finished room with a coffee table and mirror we added today not realising our ready steady baby book was on the coffee table. You would need to zoom a little to spot it but we deleted the photo about 15 mins later and sent a new one saying “oh this is a better angle.”

My only reaction was to laugh at how silly we had been but we hope they didn’t see it so we can surprise them later! And hopefully all goes well on Wednesday.

I do not understand. it's something that I've witnessed and/or experienced at every single job I have ever had, 10+ yrs of working, one being retail and all of the others being food service. I've seen new people come into a job and pick it up really fast and become really skilled at it and when they do, other people begin to treat them like shit. it's worse if they're a happy likable person. or if the person comes into the job with prior experience and is already just really good at it, there are people that dislike them automatically from the beginning. and I've also had it happen a few times exactly the same way that I've literally watched it happen to other people. my current job is a line of work that I've been in longer than anyone else there right now and it's also something I'm extremely passionate and educated about (it's specialty coffee) and the vibes shifted when I finished with training and just started working. I've made an intentional effort to not come in and take over. I don't understand why it feels like a couple of the other employees act like we're competing? at the one retail job my supervisor and I had basically a largely overlapping ven diagram of job descriptions so we were both responsible for like 80% of the same thing and then had our own little tasks individually and any time I was doing our overlapping tasks they acted so pissed and so threatened all the time to the point of starting rumors and lying about things I'd said and done and blaming stuff they'd done wrong on me. and that was not a singled out thing, they also did that to a couple of other people who were right below them but significantly out performed them. there were a couple of people at that job that got chewed out multiple times by one of the merchandisers for no fucking real reason at all and I don't think it's a coincidence that they were the ones that came in, got promoted to leads in training quickly, got shit done efficiently, and were generally really well liked by everyone. 

I genuinely do not understand people who behave this way and also why there are so many people who do act like that. what in the fuck are you threatened by? nobody is trying to take your job away or make you feel inferior? why are you not happy that someone else is ALSO good at the work and therefor it makes things easier on everybody and we've got a better functioning shop now?

1gto90x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gto90x/for_the_empire/,For The Empire!,"For the Empire!

The Grand War Council chamber of the Draknid Empire hummed with anticipation, its crystalline walls reflecting the bioluminescent glow of a thousand elite warriors. Tzzk'rix stood before the High Command, his iridescent scales rippling with pride. After all, he wasn't just any warrior - he was the youngest ever to achieve the rank of Shadow Strike Commander.

""The humans,"" Elder K'thax's voice resonated through the chamber, ""remain an enigma. Our previous attempts at infiltration have been... unsuccessful."" The Elder's fourth arm twitched, a sign of discomfort that Tzzk'rix found amusing. How dangerous could these soft-skinned primitives really be?

""With all due respect, Honored Elder,"" Tzzk'rix's mandibles clicked confidently, ""previous operatives clearly lacked my particular set of skills. These deathworlders are merely evolved primates who haven't even achieved unified planetary governance.""

The holoscreen flickered to life, displaying various human activities that had been covertly recorded. Tzzk'rix's compound eyes widened slightly at the sight of humans willingly ingesting molecular-grade thermal weapons - something they called ""ghost peppers"" - but he maintained his composure.

""Your bio-modification process begins tomorrow,"" the Chief Scientist announced, her tentacles wrapping nervously around her data pad. ""You'll be altered to appear human, complete with their revolting single-layer epidermis and limited sensory capabilities.""

Tzzk'rix suppressed a shudder. ""And my mission parameters?""

""Infiltrate a group of humans engaging in recreational activities. We believe these 'holidays' are actually combat training exercises disguised as leisure. Gather intelligence on their weaknesses and report back to us.""

Later, in his quarters, Tzzk'rix reviewed the mission briefing. His mandibles clicked in amusement at the warning labels: ""Caution: Humans have been observed continuing physical activity with multiple bone fractures"" and ""Warning: Species known to consume substances toxic to 90% of known sentient life for pleasure.""

""Primitive endurance adaptations,"" he chittered to himself, already drafting his future victory speech. ""Nothing a Draknid warrior can't handle.""

As he prepared for tomorrow's bio-modification, Tzzk'rix imagined how impressed the Council would be when he returned with detailed plans for Earth's conquest. He'd show them why he was the empire's finest warrior.

The last thing he packed was his emergency beacon - not that he'd need it. After all, how challenging could it be to survive among creatures who hadn't even evolved proper exoskeletons?

Tzzk'rix, now sporting his human disguise and answering to ""Terry,"" stood in the sweltering heat of Cairns, Australia. He'd chosen this location after intercepting human communications about something called ""The Most Extreme Adventure Tours."" Surely, if humans were training their warriors anywhere, it would be in this notorious continent where every indigenous species seemed designed for maximum lethality.

His new epidermis was already doing that disgusting human thing - sweating. Revolting. The bio-modification team had done their best, giving him the appearance of a tall, lean ""backpacker"" with what humans considered acceptable facial features. At least his cover story was simple: a Canadian tourist seeking thrills. Whatever a Canadian was.

""Oi! You must be Terry!"" A booming voice made him jump. A sun-weathered human female with alarming arm muscles approached, grinning maniacally. ""I'm Sarah, your tour guide. The rest of the group's inside the cafe. We're just having our morning coffee before heading out.""

Coffee. Tzzk'rix had read about this mysterious black liquid. A stimulant so powerful it was used as industrial cleaner on seven different worlds. And these humans just... drank it?

Inside the cafe, four more humans lounged around a table: a pair of giggling females called Emma and Jessica (""Just call us the Chaos Twins""), a male named Mike who appeared to be constructed entirely of muscle and cheerfulness, and a smaller male called Dave who wore something called a ""Star Wars"" shirt and kept making references Tzzk'rix didn't understand.

""Here mate, first cup's on me!"" Mike pushed a steaming mug toward him. ""Flat white, can't go wrong.""

Tzzk'rix stared at the cup. His mission briefing hadn't prepared him for this. He couldn't blow his cover on the first day. With what he hoped was a casual motion, he lifted the cup to his lips.

The flavor hit him like a plasma burst. His modified taste buds screamed in protest. But the humans were watching, so he swallowed. ""Delicious,"" he croaked the unexpectedly scalding liquid burning down his throat.

""Right!"" Sarah clapped her hands. ""Today's just a warm-up. We'll do some light hiking in the rainforest, spot some crocs, maybe handle a few snakes-""

""Handle... snakes?"" Tzzk'rix interrupted. Surely she was joking. Even his species knew better than to touch venomous creatures.

""Oh yeah, mate! Wait till you see the pythons. Absolute units!"" Mike's enthusiasm was terrifying.

The ""Chaos Twins"" were already showing him pictures on their communication devices of previous tours. Humans dangling off cliffs. Humans poking deadly creatures. Humans grinning while surrounded by things that could kill them.

As they piled into the tour vehicle, Dave leaned over. ""First time in Australia?""

Tzzk'rix nodded weakly.

""Don't worry about the deadly stuff,"" Dave grinned. ""It's the drop bears you really have to watch out for.""

The others burst out laughing at some joke Tzzk'rix didn't understand but his imagination glady showed him a large carnivorous beast dropping down from trees. He tried to ignore it. As they drove toward the rainforest, he began composing his first report in his head: ""Day One: Humans voluntarily consume poison for pleasure. Show signs of collective insanity. Request permission to revise mission parameters.""

But the day was young, and Tzzk'rix had no idea that coffee would soon be the least of his concerns. The rainforest awaited, and with it, his first real test of pretending to be as casually insane as these fascinating and terrifying humans.

The Australian rainforest loomed before them, a verdant death trap teeming with creatures that would be classified as biological weapons on any civilized planet. Tzzk'rix's bio-modified skin was working overtime, producing what he could only describe as a biblical flood of sweat.

""Mate, you're absolutely drenched!"" Mike clapped him on the back, nearly sending Tzzk'rix's artificial nervous system into overdrive. ""Never seen anyone sweat quite like that. You're like a human waterfall!""

Sarah pulled out something called a ""trail mix"" from her pack. ""Here, you need to replenish your electrolytes. Got some wasabi peas in there too - gives it a kick!""

Tzzk'rix accepted the mixture, not realizing that ""kick"" was a massive understatement. The wasabi hit his modified taste buds like a plasma grenade, triggering another tsunami of sweat from his malfunctioning epidermis.

""Bloody hell,"" Emma exclaimed, ""it's like he's got his own personal rain cloud! Dave, give him your spare shirt before he creates a new water source for the forest.""

Jessica pulled out her phone. ""This is definitely going on Instagram. #HumanWaterfall #SweatGoals""

The group had been hiking for three hours, and while the humans showed no signs of fatigue, they were fascinated by Tzzk'rix's unique condition. His skin suit was now operating at 300% capacity, trying desperately to regulate his temperature.

""You know,"" Dave mused, walking backward on the treacherous trail as if death wasn't literally everywhere, ""I once knew a guy who sweated like this. Turned out he was actually three aliens in a trench coat.""

Tzzk'rix nearly tripped over a root. ""That's... that's absurd! Completely impossible! Not that I would know anything about aliens, being a normal human Canadian person who sweats normally!""

The group roared with laughter. ""Classic Terry,"" Mike wheezed. ""You're hilarious, mate!""

They reached a clearing where Sarah announced their lunch break. Tzzk'rix's relief was short-lived when she pulled out sandwiches containing something called ""Vegemite.""

""Traditional Aussie bush tucker,"" she grinned, handing him one. ""Bit of an acquired taste.""

The moment the black substance touched his tongue, his skin suit went into complete meltdown. Water practically gushed from his pores, creating a small puddle beneath his feet.

""Crikey!"" Jessica exclaimed. ""Terry's not sweating anymore - he's straight-up melting!""

""Quick, someone get him a Gatorade before he turns into a puddle!"" Emma rummaged through her pack, producing a fluorescent blue liquid that Tzzk'rix's scanners identified as containing enough electrolytes to power a small spacecraft.

Dave was now filming the whole thing. ""This is better than that time we saw that guy wrestle a croc! Hey Terry, do you mind if I submit this to Australia's Funniest Home Videos?""

Tzzk'rix, now sitting in his own personal swamp, managed to croak out, ""Is this... normal for a hike?""

""Normal?"" Sarah laughed. ""Mate, this is nothing. Wait till tomorrow when we do the real challenging stuff. This is just the warm-up!""

For the first time in his distinguished military career, Tzzk'rix felt real fear. As he watched Mike casually flick away a spider that could have killed half his home planet, he realized that perhaps - just perhaps - he had underestimated these humans.

His internal communication device buzzed with an incoming message from command: ""Status report overdue. Please confirm survival.""

Tzzk'rix looked at his drenched clothes, the half-eaten death sandwich, and the group of humans treating this death march as a casual stroll. He sent back a single word: ""Help.""

The day wasn't even half over, and somewhere in the distance, thunder rolled ominously. Or perhaps it was just the sound of his dignity crumbling away, one sweat drop at a time.

The morning dawned with Tzzk'rix's skin suit finally achieving some semblance of normalcy, though he'd spent the night sending increasingly desperate messages to his superiors about the previous day's ""death march."" But today's activity, Sarah had announced with disturbing cheerfulness, would be ""white water rafting on the Tully River.""

""Watch out for the mozzies,"" Dave warned as they suited up in safety gear. ""They're proper monsters up here. Had one last week carry off a small child."" He managed to keep a straight face for exactly two seconds before breaking into a grin.

A high-pitched buzz near Tzzk'rix's ear sent him leaping three feet into the air, arms windmilling wildly. ""AERIAL ATTACK!"" he shrieked, before remembering his cover. ""I mean... oh my, what a large insect.""

Mike wiped tears from his eyes. ""Mate, that was a fly. Wait till you see the actual mosquitoes.""

The Chaos Twins were practically rolling on the ground. ""Did anyone get that on video?"" Emma gasped between fits of laughter. ""The way he just... launched!""

""Better than Olympic gymnastics,"" Jessica agreed, holding up her phone triumphantly.

Another buzz sent Tzzk'rix into an elaborate ducking maneuver that would have made his combat instructors proud. ""These blood-sucking creatures,"" he muttered, trying to maintain dignity while swatting at the air, ""they're not really the size of birds, correct?""

Sarah's grin turned positively evil. ""Oh no, some are much bigger. Especially near the river. We call the really big ones 'Drop-squitoes' - they've learned to dive-bomb from the trees.""

Tzzk'rix's internal sensors were reporting dangerous levels of stress hormones. He made a mental note to update the Empire's database: Humans employ psychological warfare through ""humor"" and deliberately false information about already terrifying wildlife.

As they approached the river, the rushing water sound nearly drowned out the insect buzzing - nearly, but not quite. Every few seconds, Tzzk'rix would twitch, jump, or perform increasingly elaborate evasive maneuvers at the slightest sound.

""Right,"" Sarah announced, ""everyone in the raft! Terry, since you're so... alert... you can take point position!""

The humans had somehow neglected to mention that ""white water rafting"" meant voluntarily hurling oneself down a rushing death trap in an inflatable vessel. As they approached the first rapid, Tzzk'rix heard another buzz and instinctively ducked, causing the raft to tilt precariously.

""PADDLE!"" Sarah shouted over the roar of water. ""And Terry, stop trying to fight the mosquitoes - they're winning!""

""They're evolving!"" he screamed back, swatting at nothing while simultaneously trying to paddle. ""They're using tactical formation strikes!""

Dave, somehow managing to film while paddling, called out, ""This is going viral! 'Canadian Tourist Declares War on Australian Insects' - perfect clickbait!""

The raft hit a particularly large wave just as Tzzk'rix heard another buzz. His reaction - a combination of combat roll and swat - sent the entire raft spinning into what Sarah later described as ""the most impressive accidental trick maneuver I've ever seen.""

As they somehow survived yet another rapid, Tzzk'rix's pride lay in tatters, much like his dignity. His mission report for the day would read: ""Humans utilize primitive water torture methods for entertainment. Local insects appear to have military training. Request immediate extraction or at minimum, orbital insect repellent deployment.""

The Chaos Twins had just started singing something about ""99 bottles of beer on the wall"" - whatever that meant. Another buzz, another jump, and Tzzk'rix wondered if perhaps the Empire should simply quarantine this entire planet and call it a day.

Standing at the edge of the Cairns Bungee platform, 164 feet above the rainforest canopy, Tzzk'rix was experiencing what humans called an ""existential crisis."" His species had evolved from sensible creatures that stayed firmly on the ground, thank you very much.

""Come on, Terry!"" Mike encouraged. ""It's just a little hop! Even my gran's done this one!""

Tzzk'rix peered over the edge, his modified human heart attempting to escape through his throat. ""This is clearly mass suicide,"" he muttered. ""The humans have finally lost what's left of their minds.""

Sarah was adjusting his harness, grinning like a maniac. ""Remember, arms out like a bird! Though maybe not like those mosquitoes you were fighting yesterday.""

""I was not fighting-"" Tzzk'rix began to back away, his feet shuffling awkwardly. ""Perhaps we could do something more reasonable, like drinking more of that industrial cleaner you call coffee?""

""No backing out now!"" Emma called, her phone already recording. ""We've got a bet going on whether your scream will break Dave's record from the croc encounter!""

That's when it happened. His bio-modified feet, still not quite calibrated to human balance parameters, encountered a small pebble. Time seemed to slow as Tzzk'rix felt himself pitching backward, then forward, his arms windmilling in what he would later insist was a tactically sound stabilization attempt.

""Oh shit, he's going!"" Jessica squealed with delight. ""This is even better than we planned!""

Tzzk'rix's scream started at a frequency that would have shattered glass on his home world, then modulated through what could only be described as a symphony of terror as he plummeted toward the earth.

""SWEET MOTHER OF THE VOID! ACTIVATE EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS! MAYDAY! MAYDAY! THIS IS NOT A DRILL!""

The humans above were howling with laughter, their commentary mixing with his continued screams.

""Did he just yell something about emergency protocols?"" Dave wheezed.

""Listen to that pitch change!"" Mike was practically crying. ""It's like an opera singer having a panic attack!""

The bungee cord caught, and Tzzk'rix bounced back up, his screams now punctuated by words in his native language that the universal translator refused to process.

""Is he speaking in tongues?"" Sarah managed between gasps of laughter. ""This is premium content!""

As he bounced up and down, gradually slowing, Tzzk'rix's mind raced through every combat training scenario he'd ever encountered. None of them had covered ""voluntary falling while attached to an elastic cord for entertainment.""

""YOU'RE DOING GREAT, TERRY!"" Emma shouted down. ""JUST SEVEN MORE BOUNCES TO GO!""

""SEVEN?!"" His voice cracked on a particularly high note. ""THIS PLANET IS INSANE! I WANT TO FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH YOUR GOVERNING BODY!""

Jessica, still filming, provided running commentary: ""Day five of 'Canadian Terry's Complete Mental Breakdown Tour' brings us to what I believe is the single greatest bungee jump reaction in human history. Note the perfect pitch of absolute terror, the creative use of what might be Latin...""

When they finally winched him back up, Tzzk'rix's skin suit was working overtime again, producing enough sweat to fill a small pool. His hair stood on end, defying both gravity and the bio-modification team's best efforts at human aesthetics.

""So,"" Sarah grinned, ""ready for the second jump?""

Tzzk'rix's response was to faint dead away, providing the humans with yet another excellent filming opportunity and confirming his growing suspicion that Earth wasn't a planet - it was an elaborate torture facility disguised as a vacation destination.

His unconscious form twitched as another mosquito buzzed past, prompting fresh peals of laughter from his tormentors - er, tour companions. Somewhere in orbit, his ship's AI logged another distress signal, this one consisting entirely of high-pitched whimpers and the words ""never again"" repeated fifty times.

The Undara Lava Tubes loomed before them, their gaping maws seeming to mock Tzzk'rix's rapidly deteriorating sanity. Still twitching from yesterday's ""bungee incident,"" he'd hoped today's cave exploration would be tame. After all, his people lived in caves for the longes time.

""Right, everyone switch on your headlamps!"" Sarah chirped, far too enthusiastically for someone about to lead a group into the planet's digestive system. ""And watch out for the huntsmen spiders - they love to drop in and say g'day!""

""Drop... in?"" Tzzk'rix's voice cracked.

""Oh yeah,"" Dave grinned, adjusting his camera's night vision setting. ""Big beautiful ones, about the size of dinner plates. Completely harmless though!""

The Chaos Twins exchanged knowing looks. ""Remember to check your pants when you feel something tickling,"" Emma added innocently. ""They're curious little buggers.""

Tzzk'rix's bio-suit sensors were already registering elevated stress levels as they ventured deeper into the cave. The darkness pressed in, broken only by their bobbing headlamps. Every shadow seemed to move, every rock formation looked like a lurking predator.

Then he felt it. A distinct tickle on his ankle.

""Walking normally. Everything is fine. Totally fine,"" he muttered, trying to ignore the sensation creeping up his leg. ""Perfectly normal human cave exploration.""

Mike's headlamp caught his face. ""You okay there, Terry? You're looking a bit peaky.""

The tickling reached his knee.

""SWEET MERCIFUL NEBULAS!"" Tzzk'rix exploded into action, performing what could only be described as an interpretive dance of pure panic. ""CREATURE! ASCENDING! LEG REGION! EMERGENCY! EMERGENCY!""

His headlamp beam bounced wildly as he hopped from foot to foot, slapping at his legs and screaming in progressively higher octaves. The humans, predictably, dissolved into hysteria.

""Jessica! Are you getting this?"" Emma wheezed between laughs.

""Every glorious second!"" Jessica steadied her phone. ""The lighting is perfect!""

Tzzk'rix's dance reached a crescendo as he attempted to remove his pants while hopping, forgetting entirely about his species' dignity or his cover story. ""TACTICAL RETREAT! ABANDON LOWER GARMENTS!""

Sarah's headlamp revealed the cause of his distress - a small cave cricket that had been seeking warmth. ""Terry, mate, it's just a-""

But Tzzk'rix was beyond reason. In his panic, he'd managed to tangle himself in his own pants, hopping directly into a shallow pool of cave water. The splash echoed through the cavern, accompanied by what sounded suspiciously like Draknid war cry.

""Did he just..."" Dave wiped tears from his eyes, ""did he just screech in Klingon?""

""Better!"" Mike was doubled over. ""He's created a whole new language of terror!""

Tzzk'rix emerged from the pool, pants around his ankles, bio-suit glitching slightly from the moisture. The cricket, unharmed, hopped away into the darkness.

""I..."" he panted, trying to salvage some dignity, ""I was merely demonstrating traditional Canadian cave dancing. Yes. Very traditional. We do this all the time in... Canada.""

""Of course you do, mate,"" Sarah patted his shoulder, barely containing her mirth. ""Of course you do.""

As they helped him up, Tzzk'rix's internal communicator buzzed with a message from command: ""Your latest biosignature readings are concerning. Should we prepare emergency extraction?""

He glanced at the humans, still wiping tears of laughter from their eyes, then at the cricket-infested darkness ahead. His reply was succinct: ""Not yet. But keep the engines warm.""

The cave seemed to echo with the sounds of human laughter and what would later become a viral video titled ""Canadian Tourist vs. Cave Cricket: A Symphony of Screams."" Somewhere in the darkness, a huntsman spider watched, waiting for its moment to drop in and say hello.

Dawn broke over Mount Bartle Frere, Queensland's highest peak, with the kind of ominous beauty that should have warned Tzzk'rix this was yet another terrible idea. His skin suit had barely recovered from the cave incident, and now here they were, preparing to climb what the humans casually referred to as ""a bit of a challenge.""

""Perfect weather for a climb!"" Sarah announced, checking her gear while dark clouds gathered overhead. ""Bit of rain'll keep us cool!""

""Rain?"" Tzzk'rix squeaked, remembering his briefing about Earth's weather. ""You mean the acid that falls from the sky?""

Mike clapped him on the shoulder. ""Mate, after yesterday's cricket ballet, I thought nothing could scare you!""

The Chaos Twins were already taking bets on what would break Terry first - the height, the weather, or the local wildlife. ""My money's on the leeches,"" Emma whispered not-so-quietly.

""The what?"" Tzzk'rix's modified voice hit a new octave.

""Oh yeah,"" Dave grinned, adjusting his ever-present camera. ""Little blood-sucking worms. They love the rain. Don't worry though - they're smaller than the mosquitoes!""

Halfway up the mountain, the rain started. Tzzk'rix's suit began its now-familiar malfunction, alternating between sauna and refrigerator settings. The humans, naturally, treated the treacherous conditions like a party.

""Look!"" Jessica pointed excitedly. ""A death adder! Terry, want to take a closer look?""

""NEGATIVE!"" He pressed himself against the rock face. ""I mean... no thank you. I am practicing my... rock hugging. Very Canadian.""

Thunder cracked overhead, causing him to emit what he would later insist was a ""tactical assessment vocalization"" but what the humans' video evidence clearly showed as a shriek that sent several birds flying.

""Did anyone else hear that?"" Mike called through the rain. ""Sounded like a pterodactyl having a breakdown!""

The climb became increasingly vertical, with the humans casually discussing lunch plans while hanging from what appeared to be dental floss attached to the mountain. Tzzk'rix's internal sensors were reporting critical levels of ""nope.""

Then came the lightning.

""Amazing!"" Sarah shouted as bolts lit up the sky. ""Nature's light show!""

Tzzk'rix's briefing had specifically mentioned Earth's habit of hurling atmospheric electricity. His species had evolved specifically to avoid such phenomena, and here were these humans, treating it like entertainment.

""We should descend!"" he pleaded. ""Surely this is beyond safe parameters!""

""Safe parameters?"" Dave laughed. ""Negative, Mr Data,"" he said in a very bad English accent.

Tzzk'rix contemplated if his emergency beacon would work through the storm.

A particularly close lightning strike illuminated something on the rock face next to him - something with far too many legs.

""Oh, that's just a giant centipede,"" Emma called out helpfully. ""They come out in the rain!""

Tzzk'rix's scream harmonized perfectly with the thunder, creating what Dave would later describe as ""nature's perfect duet."" His attempt to escape the centipede while suspended 500 meters up a mountain in a lightning storm would later go viral as ""Canadian Parkour: Extreme Edition.""

""Is he... is he trying to climb upside down?"" Jessica marveled, filming steadily despite the rain.

""TACTICAL RETREAT! TACTICAL RETREAT!"" Tzzk'rix had somehow managed to tangle himself in the safety ropes while attempting to exist in all possible directions simultaneously.

Sarah's calm voice cut through his panic: ""Only another 500 meters to go! Then we can start the really challenging part!""

Tzzk'rix's response was lost in another thunderclap, but the humans would later swear it sounded suspiciously like a prayer in an alien language, followed by what might have been coordinates for an orbital strike.

As they continued their ascent, the rain intensified, the lightning drew closer, and somewhere in the galaxy, a Draknid war council received a message consisting entirely of weather alerts and the words ""humans are insane.""

The local pub in Cairns should have been a safe haven after the mountain incident, but Tzzk'rix had learned that nowhere was truly safe on this death planet. His bio-suit was still occasionally hiccupping from the lightning exposure, causing random patches of his ""skin"" to briefly turn iridescent.

""Ladies and gentlemen!"" The pub owner's voice boomed across the room. ""It's time for our annual Ghost Pepper Wing Challenge!""

Mike's eyes lit up with unholy glee. ""Terry! You've got to enter! Show these Aussies what Canadians are made of!""

""I really shouldn't-"" Tzzk'rix began, but the Chaos Twins were already signing him up.

""The rules are simple,"" the owner explained, setting down platters of innocent-looking wings. ""Eat ten wings in ten minutes. No drinks. No dairy. Last person standing wins!""

Tzzk'rix's internal scanner analyzed the wings and immediately began flashing warning symbols he'd never seen before. The chemical composition was closer to plasma fuel than food.

""Don't worry,"" Dave grinned, camera at the ready. ""They're only rated at 1.5 million Scoville units!""

Sarah leaned in. ""Just remember - the burning sensation is all in your head!""

The competition began. Tzzk'rix watched in horror as the humans actually seemed to enjoy what was clearly chemical warfare in food form. His first bite sent emergency signals cascading through his bio-suit.

""You're turning a bit purple there, mate,"" Mike observed cheerfully.

Indeed, Tzzk'rix's skin suit was malfunctioning spectacularly, cycling through colors like a malfunctioning chameleon having a disco party. The capsaicin was interfering with his modification protocols.

""Is... is that normal?"" Jessica pointed at his left ear, which had briefly reverted to its natural antenna form.

""Completely!"" Tzzk'rix squeaked, trying to force it back into human shape. ""Very common Canadian condition! We call it... Maple Fever!""

By the fifth wing, his universal translator had crashed, causing him to alternate between English and his native clicking language. The humans, naturally, assumed this was just part of his charm.

""Listen to him!"" Emma wheezed. ""He's speaking in tongues again!""

""THERMAL OVERLOAD!"" Tzzk'rix screamed, forgetting himself entirely. ""INITIATING EMERGENCY PURGE!""

His bio-suit, unable to cope with the pepper's chemical assault, began to glitch dramatically. Patches of scales appeared and disappeared, his carefully crafted human fingers briefly morphing into claws.

""Strewth!"" the pub owner exclaimed. ""I've seen people react badly to the wings before, but this is something else!""

Dave was practically bouncing with excitement. ""This is better than that time at the cave! Look, his hair is changing color with each bite!""

The final wing proved to be Tzzk'rix's undoing. As it touched his tongue, his bio-suit went into full meltdown. His carefully constructed human appearance began to pixelate like a bad video game rendering.

""Is... is he glowing?"" Someone in the crowd asked.

""ABORT MISSION! ABORT MISSION!"" Tzzk'rix's voice modulator failed, revealing his natural harmonic screech. ""EMERGENCY EXTRACTION REQUIRED! CODE RED! CODE RED!""

The pub erupted in chaos as Tzzk'rix's true form began to show through his failing disguise. His emergency beacon activated automatically, sending out a distress signal that would have his superiors facepalming across three galaxies.

""I KNEW IT!"" Dave shouted triumphantly. ""I TOLD YOU HE WAS AN ALIEN!""

The last thing Tzzk'rix saw before his extraction beam activated was Sarah calmly taking another bite of her ghost pepper wing, giving him a thumbs up, and saying, ""Same time next year, mate?""

His final thought, as his molecular structure was beamed to safety, was that perhaps the Empire should consider reclassifying Earth not as a potential conquest but as a quarantined zone of collective insanity.

Behind him, he left a pub full of slightly drunk Australians who would forever tell the story of the Canadian tourist who turned out to be an alien, only to have everyone assume it was just another typical night in Cairns.

In the sterile confines of the Draknid Empire's flagship medical bay, Tzzk'rix floated in a regeneration tank, his natural iridescent scales still occasionally flickering with residual ghost pepper trauma. Three medical officers, two xenobiologists, and one very confused psychiatrist stood before the High Command, attempting to explain their findings.

""The damage is... unprecedented,"" Chief Medical Officer K'rzzt clicked, gesturing to the holographic displays of Tzzk'rix's bio-readings. ""His cellular structure shows signs of what appears to be voluntary exposure to multiple lethal situations.""

""Show them the footage,"" Tzzk'rix burbled through the healing gel. ""They need to understand.""

The assembled council watched in horror as the compilation of Dave's videos played out. Tzzk'rix's ""greatest hits"" included his mosquito ballet, the bungee incident, and the now-infamous ghost pepper meltdown. Several council members had to look away during the cave cricket episode.

""And the humans..."" Elder K'thax's mandibles quivered, ""they do this for... entertainment?""

""Entertainment?"" Tzzk'rix's laugh held a slightly hysterical edge. ""That's just their warm-up! They have something called 'extreme sports' that makes these activities look like larval play!""

The psychiatrist stepped forward, consulting her notes. ""Patient exhibits signs of what we're calling 'Human Exposure Trauma.' He keeps muttering about 'drop bears' and 'Vegemite' in his sleep.""

""The mission report, if you please,"" the High Commander requested.

Tzzk'rix's official report appeared on the main screen:

""CLASSIFICATION: URGENT

SUBJECT: EARTH ASSESSMENT

STATUS: TERMINATE ALL INVASION PLANS IMMEDIATELY

Findings:

1. Humans possess no survival instinct whatsoever, making them impossible to intimidate.
2. They voluntarily jump off perfectly good structures while attached to elastic cords.
3. Their recreational activities would qualify as military-grade training on any civilized world.
4. They consume substances that would be classified as biological weapons in our space.
5. Their 'tourist activities' are indistinguishable from torture methods.

Recommendation: Quarantine the entire solar system. Mark Earth as 'Approach at Own Risk.' Possibly rename it to 'That Place Where Sanity Goes to Die.'""

""Surely you're exaggerating,"" one council member protested.

In response, Tzzk'rix had them play the video of Sarah casually handling a death adder while explaining its venom potency with the same enthusiasm one might discuss a pet tribble.

""I haven't even mentioned their 'extreme cooking' shows,"" Tzzk'rix shuddered. ""Or something called 'parkour.'""

The High Commander raised all four arms for silence. ""Based on this report and evidence, I move to officially classify humans not as potential conquests, but as... let's say 'enthusiastically suicidal adrenaline enthusiasts' to be avoided at all costs.""

""They've already posted the videos online,"" Tzzk'rix added glumly. ""I'm apparently trending under #AlienTouristFails and #SpaceMateCantHandleTheHeat.""

As the council dispersed, still looking slightly shell-shocked, Tzzk'rix's communication device buzzed one last time. It was a message from Dave:

""Oi, Terry (or whatever your real name is)! Same time next year? We're planning a little base jumping expedition. Bring your alien mates - the more the merrier! P.S. Your videos have gone viral. You're a legend, mate! 🛸🌶️😱""

Tzzk'rix quickly deleted the message, turned off his device, and requested an increased dose of anxiety medication. Some species, he decided, were best admired from several galaxies away.

In his final addendum to the report, he added one last note: ""Warning: Humans don't need weapons to be dangerous. Their idea of 'fun' is sufficient to bring any empire to its knees.""

The End

(Though somewhere on Earth, the Chaos Twins were already planning ""Terry's Welcome Back Tour"" with activities that would make even a Klingon think twice.)

1gto6wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1gto6wf/summer_tyme_with_the_collectors_chapter_11/,Summer Tyme with the Collectors: Chapter 11,"**Father Time**: *Often considered the oldest of all fairies, Father Time has earned a place in the upper echelon of the faerealm. He is often depicted as being an elderly man with a long, white beard, though his appearance and age can vary greatly.*

*This fairy has a near-mastery of time, and its effects on the worlds and those who inhabit them. He can influence the flow of time, making it appear faster or slower as he sees fit, and can even put time on an individual’s side. His power comes from eons of worship and praise from the fairy and human worlds, as he was perceived as a god in both. As such, Father Time doesn’t have to lower himself to serve anyone, and has built a vast empire in the faerealm to continue feeding his access to magic.*

*It is rumored that a group of druids or warlocks harnessed his abilities during a ritual hundreds of years ago. These individuals allegedly locked portions of his power away into carefully crafted items, most resembling watches. Those lucky enough to possess such a trinket would be granted a mere fraction of Father Time’s abilities, but also surely find themselves targeted by devout followers, artifact collectors, and even the faerealm’s enforcement agency - Silver Nest.*

Summer jolts awake, sitting upright with the blanket spilling down her front. The sheet cascades down into a crumpled heap around her belly while her mind swims through the crumbling remnants of her dream. Frightening images and words echo in her head, diminishing and dwindling with every repetition until only pieces remain. She snatches her phone from the small table beside her bed, eager to confirm it *had* all just been a dream.

She creates a text group with her younger siblings and types in a few messages. “Had a terrible dream - Are you ok?? - I know it’s stupid, but I’m worried.” Only after the hurried messages show as ‘*delivered*’ does she allow herself to breathe. Her eyes remain on the illuminated screen of her phone, and she watches the clock at the upper corner of her device switch to a new minute.

“5:44 a.m.” stares up at her. It’s still one full minute before her first alarm is set to activate, and she allows a smirk to tug at her face with the knowledge it’s the first time she has woken up without the immediate need to rush into the shower. She isn’t worried about waking her brother or sister, considering they still live fairly close to home - two time zones away. Her sister, Dawn, was the first to reply, which Summer fully expected. “Fine here, you?” she responds, quickly followed by, “Isn’t it early there?”

A relieved sigh spills from her chest as Summer types in another message. The dream had felt so *real*, but that hardly made it unique. All dreams feel real when you’re in them, and the young woman felt foolish for even entertaining the idea that anything had happened to her siblings. “It’s about time for me to get up anyway, just glad you’re ok,” she replied, and had just hit ‘*send*’ when her brother, Nox, sent his own message. “I’m good, too”

Summer smiles while talking with her brother and sister, only now realizing how long it had been since the last time they communicated. It felt wrong to have spent so much time away, or to go over a month without so much as a text to them. True, they could have initiated the conversation, but Dawn and Nox were busy with their own lives. Finding time to openly talk was getting harder and harder.

The second alarm interrupts their conversation, alerting Summer to the hour. “6:00 a.m.” is right there in the corner, and she knows she needs to get up if she is to have enough time for her full morning routine. The last couple of days have started with a rushed shower, haphazard outfits, and no breakfast. This morning was already off to a much better start, and she was ready to keep it going.

Over the invigorating scents of shea butter soap, ocean breeze shampoo, and lavender conditioner, came something unexpected. Summer pauses after dragging her new razor up the length of her shin, letting this new smell tickle her nose until it struck something familiar. Her mouth began to salivate, and she smiled at just how good of an idea it was to take on a leprechaun as a roommate. 

The alluring smells of bacon, eggs, sausage, toast, and other morning delicacies continue strengthening as she finishes in the shower, and she pokes her head out the bathroom door after wrapping her hair into a towel. Down the hall and doing a little jig in the kitchen is her green-clad friend, his back to her while tending to something on the stove. She can barely see him around a corner at the end of the hallway, but takes another few moments to watch the magical man dance while something sizzles on the pan in front of him.

With a hint of blush applied to her cheeks, a neutral shade of lipstick on her lips, and her usual violet framed glasses hugging the bridge of her nose, she slips back into her room to put together an appropriate outfit for the day. She lets the towel drop from around her, then steps out of the discarded nest around her feet while looking through her closet. Her heels click-clack down the hardwood hallway as she joins Gavin for breakfast, and she idly straightens her navy blazer over a matching skirt. The emerald green blouse was picked mostly for her roommate’s approval, which she more than received when he turned around to greet her.

“Mornin’, roomie- *Patrick’s floatin’ ghost!*” he exclaims, gripping the forest green apron hanging from his neck and tugging it to the side with one hand. His other hand adjusts the collar of his grassy shirt. “Lookin’ better’n a pot of gold this mornin’, if I may say so.”

Summer felt her cheeks turning red as she smiled at him, but let her eyes drift over the assorted options for breakfast he arranged on the kitchen island. A plate of bacon sat beside another plate with easily a dozen sausage patties. There was a tray of scones, another plate with eggs that looked like they’d been prepared overeasy, and another flat tray with two mouthwatering towers - one made of pancakes, the other waffles. Nestled in the middle of all that was a pitcher of orange juice, one with apple juice, and a third that must have been coffee. 

“This all looks and smells incredible, Gavin,” she said with a wide grin.

“Well, figured I owe ya,” he replied, summoning a plate from the nearby cabinet. “What with givin’ me a place ta stay, gettin’ my gold back from that thievin’ Ralv, and all…”

“I would say not to worry about it, but…” Summer said playfully while Gavin filled the plate with enough breakfast to keep her full until nighttime, “...feel free to cook whenever you like.”

“And donchu worry about the mess,” he continued, “I’ll get it all cleaned up before ya get home.”

“Thank you,” she said sincerely.

The morning was off to a perfect start. If Summer was the cynical type, she might be expecting something awful to happen. Instead, she had a full belly, spring in her step, and a happy melody in her heart as she rode the bus to the office. A morning of covering for Mrs. Boggury while she was in court awaited her, as did lunch with her boss and the judge. It was looking like a great day full of learning and falling into her place in the world, and everything was just as it should be.

*Until* she arrived at the office. Summer walked into the office she shares with her affluential boss to find her in a bit of a huff. She has arrived early and watches as Mrs. Boggury sends the phone back into its cradle on her desk with a resounding *clack*, and her free hand floats up to idly trace the silver curves and bends on her enchanted pendant. ‘*Ever have time just… work out for you?*’ plays through her mind, perfectly replicating Gavin’s voice as she wonders if there really is something to it. The briefcase in her other hand brushes onto her skirt as Mrs. Boggury looks up at her, annoyance clear in her face.

“I’m sorry, Summer,” she starts. The tone in her words makes Summer’s heart drop, and she’s *certain* she is about to be let go. Her hand closes around the device hanging from her neck as Mrs. Boggury continues, “That was Mr. Flechbaum, *James*. He’s already at the courthouse and is dead set on taking the settlement, rather than hold the brokerage responsible. I have to get going, please take messages and field questions as best you can in my absence.”

Summer’s heart raced at the prospect of filling in for Vivian, even if for just an hour or two. She has taken the time to study all of the upcoming and active cases, but is still quite new to the field. While Summer feels qualified, doubts linger that she’s truly ready. Mrs. Boggury picks up on the young woman’s hesitation, and puts a reassuring smile on her face.

“I have every confidence in you, Ms. Tyme,” she says. “If you need anything, or are unsure, you can either take a message and we can work through it later, or ask another of the associates in the office for some help. You’ll do great.”

“Hold on,” Summer adds after setting her briefcase onto her desk.

She walks across the office to a wall of cabinets, opens one of the doors, and quickly finds the file she is looking for. Mrs. Boggury watches her young assistant with a smirk, waiting at the open door until Summer hands over the blue folder.

“How did you know?” Mrs. Boggury asks while examining the name on the tab.

“I didn’t, but figured it couldn’t hurt to make sure,” she replies.

“Flechbaum, James… can’t *believe* I nearly forgot to grab his file.”

“That’s what you have me for,” Summer offers, trying to disguise just how pleased with herself she was.

“Yes,” her boss agrees, slipping the file into her own briefcase.

There’s a moment of hesitation, but Mrs. Boggury pauses at the door for a second longer as if considering something. Summer is hopeful she’ll be able to accompany her to the hearing, but knows she is still much too new and unpracticed for an actual interaction. That would all come later, but she still had quite a bit of learning to do. 

“The judge on this case is an old friend. Impartial and unbiased, but a friend nonetheless. You may have noticed my blocked out lunch hour today? I would like you to join us for lunch today.”

Summer’s eyes are open wider than she realized, and she quickly blinks until they return to normal. The smile on her face remains, and she nods an enthusiastic reply. 

“Good, now… I’m off,” Mrs. Boggury announces, patting her charcoal gray suit jacket and scanning the office once again. “Unless there’s something *else* I’m forgetting?”

She flashes Summer a coy smirk, then turns and walks down the hallway. Summer remains in place, stunned at the interaction that just happened. It was just her third day, and she was already contributing to the success of her boss, and the firm. For the first time in a very long time, the young professional was *certain* everything would work out in the best way.

*Until* Mrs. Boggury returned just a half hour later. She moved through the open doorway with a groan, then turned and closed the door. Her forehead knocked against the broad barrier once, twice, then three times before she made her way to her desk. It didn’t take a body language expert to know that things probably hadn’t gone well, but Summer was apprehensive to ask. The silence was deafening, a smothering force beyond comprehension as Mrs. Boggury sat down.

“Hate to ask…” Summer begins, hoping the levity in her voice might ease any tension.

“Don’t,” Mrs. Boggury replied, glancing through emails with unfocused eyes. 

Summer nods solemnly, and starts finishing the notes she had prepared in her boss’s absence. There had been a couple phone calls, four emails, and one question posed to another associate, and she had painstakingly recorded it all. The silence doesn’t last long, however, as Mrs. Boggury starts talking again.

“Here’s a guy who invested his life savings-” she stumbles to a halt with a frustrated sigh, debating on whether or not the client confidentiality applied to her assistant. “I don’t know… just, they violated the terms and trust without telling him. Basically lost a huge chunk of his money on risky investments without approval, all to buy themselves out of those same investments. We can’t dig into their practices without a warrant, and we can’t get a warrant without sufficient reason. It’s just a mess…”

“He settled?” Summer asks, her brow furrowed behind the high frame of her glasses.

“He settled. For less than the sum they lost, but enough to satisfy his demands. We **know** they’re dirty, and this was the best chance to prove it and keep them from burning countless others out of-”

Vivian stops herself again. Their confidentiality clause assures clients that their business remains private, and she has gone to great lengths to build and retain such trust. Summer *is* an employee, but she hadn’t had any part in this case. While Mrs. Boggury has little doubt Summer would keep it all confidential, she hadn’t signed the contract alongside them. 

“I would love to vent more, but- It’s really nothing personal or anything. I know you wouldn’t spill any secrets or anything, but-”

“No need to explain,” Summer interrupts. “You’ve only known me for a couple days, I totally understand the hesitance.”

“We’ll have another opportunity, I’m sure,” Mrs. Boggury continues. “This was just the best opportunity that had been presented in *years*.”

“You can’t convince the judge to issue a warrant?” Summer offers.

“Not without sufficient cause. The brokerage has some *deep* pockets. I wouldn’t want to suggest they have the right people in those pockets as well, but it would be all too easy for them to make things harder for us here. We need something better than hunches, no matter how valid they may be.”

The door swings open before Summer can reply, and Mrs. Boggury’s mother strides in. She’s wearing a black, wide-brim hat with a green feather nestled into a scarlet ribbon hugging the dome over her head. That was just about all that was different in her attire today, and Summer found herself wondering if the older woman always wore the same violet suit jacket over a red-violet shirt with blue-violet slacks. Her cane was still the same, almost too short golden pole, but her hand was holding firm to an amethyst hook at the top.

“I have been *waiting* for **hours** for some assistance!” she announced loudly.

Her shrill declaration forced Summer into an alert posture, and she nearly felt her heart stop. The young woman glanced at her boss, and was surprised to see a calm expression combating one of amusement on her face. Summer relaxed a little, and let some of the tension ease from her muscles as she looked over at the older lady.

“I’m sorry, do you have an appointment, miss…” Mrs. Boggury started, clearly making an effort to keep a straight face.

“Is that any way to talk to your elders?” the older lady asked, raising her cane and pointing the worn end of it at her daughter. 

The two broke into laughter at roughly the same time, and Summer let herself follow suit. She wondered how often an interaction like this happened, and hoped it was frequent. Their mother-daughter relationship brought a fond happiness to her heart, and seemed to instantly improve Vivian’s mood. 

“Court was a mess today,” Mrs. Boggury confessed to her mother. “I’m honestly glad you decided to stop by for a visit.”

“Still too busy to go to lunch with your dear, sweet mother, though?” the older lady asked with a playful smirk.

“It’s…” Vivian starts, making a show of aggressively looking at her watch, “...you’re about three hours too early!”

“I’m making an appointment,” her mother responds flatly, keeping the sly smirk on her face.

“It just so happens my lunch hour has unexpectedly opened up, so you’re in luck.”

“And your rising star, here?” the aged woman asks, gesturing at Summer with the business end of her cane.

“Summer is always welcome to join,” Vivian agrees, turning her attention to her young assistant.

Summer felt the heat of awkward embarrassment burn in her cheeks as she fell into the center stage. Both of the other women seemed to be waiting for her response, but she was still trying to catch up to what Mrs. Boggury had said. Had lunch with the judge fallen through after the case had settled?

“Oh- yes, I would love to,” she starts, glancing at her boss as if searching for a clue. “We don’t have another meeting?”

Vivian shakes her head in response. There’s a clear annoyance behind her eyes, but Summer certainly wasn’t about to press for any information. Not yet, at least.

“I could certainly use her help in the meantime,” the older lady interjected, “since there are no meetings today?”

The request took Summer by surprise. She had only just started working at the firm, and had hardly put in a full day’s work. There was so much she could learn from Vivian, especially in their down-time. She didn’t like the idea of putting in hardly an hour before her work day comes to a close, but wasn’t about to voice such a concern.

“What do you think, Summer?” Mrs. Boggury asks, raising her brows while leaving the decision to her employee.

What was she to do? On the one hand, Summer is just starting out on her journey to become an amazing attorney. On the other hand, she doesn’t want to insult or hurt any feelings. Would something like that be held over her head in her career? It would be significantly more difficult to achieve her goals as an attorney after spending years under Mrs. Boggury’s wing, and she knew she could do the most good for everyone with this kind of experience.

“I would love to help,” she starts, making sure to pick her words carefully. “You’re sure the office can spare someone of my talents?” Summer finishes dramatically.

Vivian laughs in response, nodding her head while glancing at a new email on her screen. Summer looks to the older lady after getting permission from her boss, and hopes she’s not making some kind of mistake. 

“Remind you of someone?” the older lady asks Vivian with a grin. “It’s like getting stuck with you all over again.”

Summer shuts her computer down and gathers up her briefcase before following the older woman out of the office. She turns back just before stepping fully into the hall.

“Call if anything comes up?” she asks, though she wonders what Mrs. Boggury could possibly need from her at this point in her career.

“She’ll be fine,” the older lady says from a few paces away. “*I*, on the other hand, might expire before we reach the door!”

Mrs. Boggury shakes her head with a smile, laughing as Summer hurries after the older woman. It doesn’t take long for them to make it out the front door, and Summer joins the older woman on a journey to the bus stop. She asks internally about the older lady’s car, the Volkswagen beetle from yesterday, but decides to keep her questions to herself. Maybe she simply liked riding the bus?

“You know,” the older woman starts once they’ve found a pair of seats on the bus, “I still live in the very house your dear boss grew up in.”

Summer nods, but her mind wanders. What could this woman need with her? Why was she so quick to get on a bus with someone she hardly knew, with the intention of going somewhere she had never been? And why could she simply not remember this woman’s name? They had doubtlessly been introduced, hadn’t they?

“...and now she’s a grown, achieved attorney.” the older woman finishes as Summer falls out of her mental spiral. “I’m sure you’ll find it interesting.”

Rather than ask her name again, or what she was expected to be doing, Summer decides to smile and nod. It was a gesture that seldom let her down in the past, and she was certain it wouldn’t let her down now. Still, she hoped she hadn’t missed anything important, or appeared rudely vacant while the… *Mother*, we’ll say, was talking.

“Next stop is hours,” Mother explained, “and then it’s just a short walk. You’ll help me along, won’t you?”

Mother’s voice suddenly sounded different. Frail, in a way, yet… strong? Perhaps that wasn’t the right word. Summer searched her mind for the appropriate description, but hadn’t stumbled onto it as the bus screeched to a halt.

“Here we go,” Mother announced before rising to her feet.

Summer got up beside her and offered an arm. A warm smile crossed Mother’s face as she settled her hand in the crook of Summer’s arm. The dull tap-clack-thump of heels, flats, and cane carries the duo to the front of the bus, and Summer awkwardly helps the older woman down the high steps. Finally, they’re off the bus and taking a quick breather on the sidewalk before walking the rest of the way to Mother’s house, the house that watched Mrs. Boggury grow.

Excitement surged through Summer’s veins unexpectedly. Granted, she *did* respect Vivian, more than just as her boss. The woman had inspired her in so many ways, and was as close to a golden example as anyone could get. Even so, it wasn’t like Mrs. Boggury was any kind of idol. She wasn’t going to Disney World, or visiting Ryan Reynolds’ house. Why was she so giddy?

Mother stretches her back as they stand on the sidewalk. The realization hit suddenly, and Summer glanced around for a bus stop, or any indication that the bus would be expected in this spot. It was just a regular sidewalk in a residential area, nothing but cracked squares of concrete, neatly landscaped yards, a handful of trees, and surprisingly unique houses. Not the typical cookie-cutter style where every house looks the exact same, these houses all appeared individually planned, designed, and constructed.

“Back when architecture was an art,” Mother supplied, seemingly reading Summer’s mind. “This one,” she adds, pointing at the house right in front of them.

The walkway was made out of flattened, oblong stones, with each rock more than wide enough for whoever might be walking along the winding path. It twisted one way, curved back the other, and led them to the exaggerated porch of a simple, one story house. The porch extended from the door roughly eight feet, sitting all along the front of the house and tracing back around the left corner. There were rocking chairs, a bench swing, and a small table arranged on the porch, all covered by the wide slope of the roof above. Summer’s heels thudded across the wooden floor leading to the door, and she couldn’t deny the wonder captivating her soul. 

They get to the artistically crafted door as the screen door enclosing the screened up porch swings shut behind them. Mother’s door is carved out of a single piece of wood, one that looks both sturdy, and heavy. It’s painted a deep green, but on closer inspection appears to maybe just *be* green? An assortment of designs are carved into the wood, and Summer recognizes a few of them being Egyptian hieroglyphics, Greek letters, and another Celtic symbol. Those, along with others she cannot place, are arranged along the edges of the door, with other strange sigils carved around the translucent glass arching from the middle left, reaching close to the center top, then bending back down to an end on the middle right side. The silver door knob has polished stones set into it, with what could very well be an emerald at the top, an amethyst on the left, ruby below, and something blue… *lapis?* on the right.

“It’s not going to bite,” Mother says, and Summer can hear the smile in the old woman’s voice without even seeing it.

Her hand trembles as she reaches out for the doorknob, but she can’t fathom why. She’s nervous, excited, apprehensive, and captivated by the appearance of the door, and fights through the confusion of why it has inspired such emotions while forcing her hand to the knob. A shiver rolls up her arm as she clutches the finely designed knob, and an exhausted sigh spills from her lungs. There’s a strange sense of invigoration while her fingers close around it, and she is unable to keep herself from smiling when the knob turns with her hand.

1gto6qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1gto6qc/i_hate_my_dad/,I Hate My Dad ,"I’m going to give some brief context. I (26,F) live at home with my parents, they’re married but not happily. I’ve never known my parents to be in a “relationship”, just sort of resentful, angry roommates. Separate rooms and everything for the past 15 to 20 years I can’t even remember. 

So this morning I went to Starbucks and I picked up some coffees. I knocked on my dad’s (57) door, said “here” and he replied something back to the effect of open the door or come in. I started to open the door, was telling him to grab this and my dad was totally naked. Front on view, wiping his body with a towel. I didn’t have my glasses on so I was like frozen for a second. I thought I was seeing this wrong or maybe he said no don’t come in and I misheard. But I’m standing there and he didn’t cover, he didn’t freak out. That half a second too long I was in shock he was still just on display idk. 

So I slam the door and he just says “oh sorry I thought it was your mother.” Even it was my mother they haven’t been consensually intimate since my siblings were born like 20 years ago. I know this for a fact, small house, they work different schedules, blah blah blah… but even apart from that I know he couldn’t mistake my voice from my mother’s. I feel angry. I feel violated but maybe I’m overreacting? My father has never molested me or made “passes” but he’s always been a pervert. 

He had suitcases of playboy magazines before we had internet in the house. Eventually they turned into him taking out photos from said magazines and hanging them on the downstairs wall (my mother never went down there.) When I would rip them down, another would be up a few days later. Then when we got internet, I wasn’t allowed to use our computer after a while because all the porn he was searching destroyed it. Viruses and ads would pop up nonstop of naked women. Maybe like 10 years ago now he downloaded Facebook and a family member stopped talking to him because of the porn he was “unknowingly” reposting. 2020, he was fired from a really good, unionized job because a woman said he slapped her ass while she was walking by… I wish I could say no one believed it when it happened but we know him. I can go on & on but the point is he has a history. 


All that to say, maybe I’m hyper sensitive to his perversions. Maybe he really didn’t know it was me but I think he did or at least didn’t care who it was. I absolutely hate him right now. I know there’s things people don’t talk about but I’ve never known anyone else who has a sicko father like this. ",2,1731878921.0,Vent,2,1.0,False
1gto6l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1gto6l2/fiction_summer_tyme_with_the_collectors_chapter_11/,[Fiction] Summer Tyme with the Collectors: Chapter 11,"**Father Time**: *Often considered the oldest of all fairies, Father Time has earned a place in the upper echelon of the faerealm. He is often depicted as being an elderly man with a long, white beard, though his appearance and age can vary greatly.*

*This fairy has a near-mastery of time, and its effects on the worlds and those who inhabit them. He can influence the flow of time, making it appear faster or slower as he sees fit, and can even put time on an individual’s side. His power comes from eons of worship and praise from the fairy and human worlds, as he was perceived as a god in both. As such, Father Time doesn’t have to lower himself to serve anyone, and has built a vast empire in the faerealm to continue feeding his access to magic.*

*It is rumored that a group of druids or warlocks harnessed his abilities during a ritual hundreds of years ago. These individuals allegedly locked portions of his power away into carefully crafted items, most resembling watches. Those lucky enough to possess such a trinket would be granted a mere fraction of Father Time’s abilities, but also surely find themselves targeted by devout followers, artifact collectors, and even the faerealm’s enforcement agency - Silver Nest.*

Summer jolts awake, sitting upright with the blanket spilling down her front. The sheet cascades down into a crumpled heap around her belly while her mind swims through the crumbling remnants of her dream. Frightening images and words echo in her head, diminishing and dwindling with every repetition until only pieces remain. She snatches her phone from the small table beside her bed, eager to confirm it *had* all just been a dream.

She creates a text group with her younger siblings and types in a few messages. “Had a terrible dream - Are you ok?? - I know it’s stupid, but I’m worried.” Only after the hurried messages show as ‘*delivered*’ does she allow herself to breathe. Her eyes remain on the illuminated screen of her phone, and she watches the clock at the upper corner of her device switch to a new minute.

“5:44 a.m.” stares up at her. It’s still one full minute before her first alarm is set to activate, and she allows a smirk to tug at her face with the knowledge it’s the first time she has woken up without the immediate need to rush into the shower. She isn’t worried about waking her brother or sister, considering they still live fairly close to home - two time zones away. Her sister, Dawn, was the first to reply, which Summer fully expected. “Fine here, you?” she responds, quickly followed by, “Isn’t it early there?”

A relieved sigh spills from her chest as Summer types in another message. The dream had felt so *real*, but that hardly made it unique. All dreams feel real when you’re in them, and the young woman felt foolish for even entertaining the idea that anything had happened to her siblings. “It’s about time for me to get up anyway, just glad you’re ok,” she replied, and had just hit ‘*send*’ when her brother, Nox, sent his own message. “I’m good, too”

Summer smiles while talking with her brother and sister, only now realizing how long it had been since the last time they communicated. It felt wrong to have spent so much time away, or to go over a month without so much as a text to them. True, they could have initiated the conversation, but Dawn and Nox were busy with their own lives. Finding time to openly talk was getting harder and harder.

The second alarm interrupts their conversation, alerting Summer to the hour. “6:00 a.m.” is right there in the corner, and she knows she needs to get up if she is to have enough time for her full morning routine. The last couple of days have started with a rushed shower, haphazard outfits, and no breakfast. This morning was already off to a much better start, and she was ready to keep it going.

Over the invigorating scents of shea butter soap, ocean breeze shampoo, and lavender conditioner, came something unexpected. Summer pauses after dragging her new razor up the length of her shin, letting this new smell tickle her nose until it struck something familiar. Her mouth began to salivate, and she smiled at just how good of an idea it was to take on a leprechaun as a roommate. 

The alluring smells of bacon, eggs, sausage, toast, and other morning delicacies continue strengthening as she finishes in the shower, and she pokes her head out the bathroom door after wrapping her hair into a towel. Down the hall and doing a little jig in the kitchen is her green-clad friend, his back to her while tending to something on the stove. She can barely see him around a corner at the end of the hallway, but takes another few moments to watch the magical man dance while something sizzles on the pan in front of him.

With a hint of blush applied to her cheeks, a neutral shade of lipstick on her lips, and her usual violet framed glasses hugging the bridge of her nose, she slips back into her room to put together an appropriate outfit for the day. She lets the towel drop from around her, then steps out of the discarded nest around her feet while looking through her closet. Her heels click-clack down the hardwood hallway as she joins Gavin for breakfast, and she idly straightens her navy blazer over a matching skirt. The emerald green blouse was picked mostly for her roommate’s approval, which she more than received when he turned around to greet her.

“Mornin’, roomie- *Patrick’s floatin’ ghost!*” he exclaims, gripping the forest green apron hanging from his neck and tugging it to the side with one hand. His other hand adjusts the collar of his grassy shirt. “Lookin’ better’n a pot of gold this mornin’, if I may say so.”

Summer felt her cheeks turning red as she smiled at him, but let her eyes drift over the assorted options for breakfast he arranged on the kitchen island. A plate of bacon sat beside another plate with easily a dozen sausage patties. There was a tray of scones, another plate with eggs that looked like they’d been prepared overeasy, and another flat tray with two mouthwatering towers - one made of pancakes, the other waffles. Nestled in the middle of all that was a pitcher of orange juice, one with apple juice, and a third that must have been coffee. 

“This all looks and smells incredible, Gavin,” she said with a wide grin.

“Well, figured I owe ya,” he replied, summoning a plate from the nearby cabinet. “What with givin’ me a place ta stay, gettin’ my gold back from that thievin’ Ralv, and all…”

“I would say not to worry about it, but…” Summer said playfully while Gavin filled the plate with enough breakfast to keep her full until nighttime, “...feel free to cook whenever you like.”

“And donchu worry about the mess,” he continued, “I’ll get it all cleaned up before ya get home.”

“Thank you,” she said sincerely.

The morning was off to a perfect start. If Summer was the cynical type, she might be expecting something awful to happen. Instead, she had a full belly, spring in her step, and a happy melody in her heart as she rode the bus to the office. A morning of covering for Mrs. Boggury while she was in court awaited her, as did lunch with her boss and the judge. It was looking like a great day full of learning and falling into her place in the world, and everything was just as it should be.

*Until* she arrived at the office. Summer walked into the office she shares with her affluential boss to find her in a bit of a huff. She has arrived early and watches as Mrs. Boggury sends the phone back into its cradle on her desk with a resounding *clack*, and her free hand floats up to idly trace the silver curves and bends on her enchanted pendant. ‘*Ever have time just… work out for you?*’ plays through her mind, perfectly replicating Gavin’s voice as she wonders if there really is something to it. The briefcase in her other hand brushes onto her skirt as Mrs. Boggury looks up at her, annoyance clear in her face.

“I’m sorry, Summer,” she starts. The tone in her words makes Summer’s heart drop, and she’s *certain* she is about to be let go. Her hand closes around the device hanging from her neck as Mrs. Boggury continues, “That was Mr. Flechbaum, *James*. He’s already at the courthouse and is dead set on taking the settlement, rather than hold the brokerage responsible. I have to get going, please take messages and field questions as best you can in my absence.”

Summer’s heart raced at the prospect of filling in for Vivian, even if for just an hour or two. She has taken the time to study all of the upcoming and active cases, but is still quite new to the field. While Summer feels qualified, doubts linger that she’s truly ready. Mrs. Boggury picks up on the young woman’s hesitation, and puts a reassuring smile on her face.

“I have every confidence in you, Ms. Tyme,” she says. “If you need anything, or are unsure, you can either take a message and we can work through it later, or ask another of the associates in the office for some help. You’ll do great.”

“Hold on,” Summer adds after setting her briefcase onto her desk.

She walks across the office to a wall of cabinets, opens one of the doors, and quickly finds the file she is looking for. Mrs. Boggury watches her young assistant with a smirk, waiting at the open door until Summer hands over the blue folder.

“How did you know?” Mrs. Boggury asks while examining the name on the tab.

“I didn’t, but figured it couldn’t hurt to make sure,” she replies.

“Flechbaum, James… can’t *believe* I nearly forgot to grab his file.”

“That’s what you have me for,” Summer offers, trying to disguise just how pleased with herself she was.

“Yes,” her boss agrees, slipping the file into her own briefcase.

There’s a moment of hesitation, but Mrs. Boggury pauses at the door for a second longer as if considering something. Summer is hopeful she’ll be able to accompany her to the hearing, but knows she is still much too new and unpracticed for an actual interaction. That would all come later, but she still had quite a bit of learning to do. 

“The judge on this case is an old friend. Impartial and unbiased, but a friend nonetheless. You may have noticed my blocked out lunch hour today? I would like you to join us for lunch today.”

Summer’s eyes are open wider than she realized, and she quickly blinks until they return to normal. The smile on her face remains, and she nods an enthusiastic reply. 

“Good, now… I’m off,” Mrs. Boggury announces, patting her charcoal gray suit jacket and scanning the office once again. “Unless there’s something *else* I’m forgetting?”

She flashes Summer a coy smirk, then turns and walks down the hallway. Summer remains in place, stunned at the interaction that just happened. It was just her third day, and she was already contributing to the success of her boss, and the firm. For the first time in a very long time, the young professional was *certain* everything would work out in the best way.

*Until* Mrs. Boggury returned just a half hour later. She moved through the open doorway with a groan, then turned and closed the door. Her forehead knocked against the broad barrier once, twice, then three times before she made her way to her desk. It didn’t take a body language expert to know that things probably hadn’t gone well, but Summer was apprehensive to ask. The silence was deafening, a smothering force beyond comprehension as Mrs. Boggury sat down.

“Hate to ask…” Summer begins, hoping the levity in her voice might ease any tension.

“Don’t,” Mrs. Boggury replied, glancing through emails with unfocused eyes. 

Summer nods solemnly, and starts finishing the notes she had prepared in her boss’s absence. There had been a couple phone calls, four emails, and one question posed to another associate, and she had painstakingly recorded it all. The silence doesn’t last long, however, as Mrs. Boggury starts talking again.

“Here’s a guy who invested his life savings-” she stumbles to a halt with a frustrated sigh, debating on whether or not the client confidentiality applied to her assistant. “I don’t know… just, they violated the terms and trust without telling him. Basically lost a huge chunk of his money on risky investments without approval, all to buy themselves out of those same investments. We can’t dig into their practices without a warrant, and we can’t get a warrant without sufficient reason. It’s just a mess…”

“He settled?” Summer asks, her brow furrowed behind the high frame of her glasses.

“He settled. For less than the sum they lost, but enough to satisfy his demands. We **know** they’re dirty, and this was the best chance to prove it and keep them from burning countless others out of-”

Vivian stops herself again. Their confidentiality clause assures clients that their business remains private, and she has gone to great lengths to build and retain such trust. Summer *is* an employee, but she hadn’t had any part in this case. While Mrs. Boggury has little doubt Summer would keep it all confidential, she hadn’t signed the contract alongside them. 

“I would love to vent more, but- It’s really nothing personal or anything. I know you wouldn’t spill any secrets or anything, but-”

“No need to explain,” Summer interrupts. “You’ve only known me for a couple days, I totally understand the hesitance.”

“We’ll have another opportunity, I’m sure,” Mrs. Boggury continues. “This was just the best opportunity that had been presented in *years*.”

“You can’t convince the judge to issue a warrant?” Summer offers.

“Not without sufficient cause. The brokerage has some *deep* pockets. I wouldn’t want to suggest they have the right people in those pockets as well, but it would be all too easy for them to make things harder for us here. We need something better than hunches, no matter how valid they may be.”

The door swings open before Summer can reply, and Mrs. Boggury’s mother strides in. She’s wearing a black, wide-brim hat with a green feather nestled into a scarlet ribbon hugging the dome over her head. That was just about all that was different in her attire today, and Summer found herself wondering if the older woman always wore the same violet suit jacket over a red-violet shirt with blue-violet slacks. Her cane was still the same, almost too short golden pole, but her hand was holding firm to an amethyst hook at the top.

“I have been *waiting* for **hours** for some assistance!” she announced loudly.

Her shrill declaration forced Summer into an alert posture, and she nearly felt her heart stop. The young woman glanced at her boss, and was surprised to see a calm expression combating one of amusement on her face. Summer relaxed a little, and let some of the tension ease from her muscles as she looked over at the older lady.

“I’m sorry, do you have an appointment, miss…” Mrs. Boggury started, clearly making an effort to keep a straight face.

“Is that any way to talk to your elders?” the older lady asked, raising her cane and pointing the worn end of it at her daughter. 

The two broke into laughter at roughly the same time, and Summer let herself follow suit. She wondered how often an interaction like this happened, and hoped it was frequent. Their mother-daughter relationship brought a fond happiness to her heart, and seemed to instantly improve Vivian’s mood. 

“Court was a mess today,” Mrs. Boggury confessed to her mother. “I’m honestly glad you decided to stop by for a visit.”

“Still too busy to go to lunch with your dear, sweet mother, though?” the older lady asked with a playful smirk.

“It’s…” Vivian starts, making a show of aggressively looking at her watch, “...you’re about three hours too early!”

“I’m making an appointment,” her mother responds flatly, keeping the sly smirk on her face.

“It just so happens my lunch hour has unexpectedly opened up, so you’re in luck.”

“And your rising star, here?” the aged woman asks, gesturing at Summer with the business end of her cane.

“Summer is always welcome to join,” Vivian agrees, turning her attention to her young assistant.

Summer felt the heat of awkward embarrassment burn in her cheeks as she fell into the center stage. Both of the other women seemed to be waiting for her response, but she was still trying to catch up to what Mrs. Boggury had said. Had lunch with the judge fallen through after the case had settled?

“Oh- yes, I would love to,” she starts, glancing at her boss as if searching for a clue. “We don’t have another meeting?”

Vivian shakes her head in response. There’s a clear annoyance behind her eyes, but Summer certainly wasn’t about to press for any information. Not yet, at least.

“I could certainly use her help in the meantime,” the older lady interjected, “since there are no meetings today?”

The request took Summer by surprise. She had only just started working at the firm, and had hardly put in a full day’s work. There was so much she could learn from Vivian, especially in their down-time. She didn’t like the idea of putting in hardly an hour before her work day comes to a close, but wasn’t about to voice such a concern.

“What do you think, Summer?” Mrs. Boggury asks, raising her brows while leaving the decision to her employee.

What was she to do? On the one hand, Summer is just starting out on her journey to become an amazing attorney. On the other hand, she doesn’t want to insult or hurt any feelings. Would something like that be held over her head in her career? It would be significantly more difficult to achieve her goals as an attorney after spending years under Mrs. Boggury’s wing, and she knew she could do the most good for everyone with this kind of experience.

“I would love to help,” she starts, making sure to pick her words carefully. “You’re sure the office can spare someone of my talents?” Summer finishes dramatically.

Vivian laughs in response, nodding her head while glancing at a new email on her screen. Summer looks to the older lady after getting permission from her boss, and hopes she’s not making some kind of mistake. 

“Remind you of someone?” the older lady asks Vivian with a grin. “It’s like getting stuck with you all over again.”

Summer shuts her computer down and gathers up her briefcase before following the older woman out of the office. She turns back just before stepping fully into the hall.

“Call if anything comes up?” she asks, though she wonders what Mrs. Boggury could possibly need from her at this point in her career.

“She’ll be fine,” the older lady says from a few paces away. “*I*, on the other hand, might expire before we reach the door!”

Mrs. Boggury shakes her head with a smile, laughing as Summer hurries after the older woman. It doesn’t take long for them to make it out the front door, and Summer joins the older woman on a journey to the bus stop. She asks internally about the older lady’s car, the Volkswagen beetle from yesterday, but decides to keep her questions to herself. Maybe she simply liked riding the bus?

“You know,” the older woman starts once they’ve found a pair of seats on the bus, “I still live in the very house your dear boss grew up in.”

Summer nods, but her mind wanders. What could this woman need with her? Why was she so quick to get on a bus with someone she hardly knew, with the intention of going somewhere she had never been? And why could she simply not remember this woman’s name? They had doubtlessly been introduced, hadn’t they?

“...and now she’s a grown, achieved attorney.” the older woman finishes as Summer falls out of her mental spiral. “I’m sure you’ll find it interesting.”

Rather than ask her name again, or what she was expected to be doing, Summer decides to smile and nod. It was a gesture that seldom let her down in the past, and she was certain it wouldn’t let her down now. Still, she hoped she hadn’t missed anything important, or appeared rudely vacant while the… *Mother*, we’ll say, was talking.

“Next stop is hours,” Mother explained, “and then it’s just a short walk. You’ll help me along, won’t you?”

Mother’s voice suddenly sounded different. Frail, in a way, yet… strong? Perhaps that wasn’t the right word. Summer searched her mind for the appropriate description, but hadn’t stumbled onto it as the bus screeched to a halt.

“Here we go,” Mother announced before rising to her feet.

Summer got up beside her and offered an arm. A warm smile crossed Mother’s face as she settled her hand in the crook of Summer’s arm. The dull tap-clack-thump of heels, flats, and cane carries the duo to the front of the bus, and Summer awkwardly helps the older woman down the high steps. Finally, they’re off the bus and taking a quick breather on the sidewalk before walking the rest of the way to Mother’s house, the house that watched Mrs. Boggury grow.

Excitement surged through Summer’s veins unexpectedly. Granted, she *did* respect Vivian, more than just as her boss. The woman had inspired her in so many ways, and was as close to a golden example as anyone could get. Even so, it wasn’t like Mrs. Boggury was any kind of idol. She wasn’t going to Disney World, or visiting Ryan Reynolds’ house. Why was she so giddy?

Mother stretches her back as they stand on the sidewalk. The realization hit suddenly, and Summer glanced around for a bus stop, or any indication that the bus would be expected in this spot. It was just a regular sidewalk in a residential area, nothing but cracked squares of concrete, neatly landscaped yards, a handful of trees, and surprisingly unique houses. Not the typical cookie-cutter style where every house looks the exact same, these houses all appeared individually planned, designed, and constructed.

“Back when architecture was an art,” Mother supplied, seemingly reading Summer’s mind. “This one,” she adds, pointing at the house right in front of them.

The walkway was made out of flattened, oblong stones, with each rock more than wide enough for whoever might be walking along the winding path. It twisted one way, curved back the other, and led them to the exaggerated porch of a simple, one story house. The porch extended from the door roughly eight feet, sitting all along the front of the house and tracing back around the left corner. There were rocking chairs, a bench swing, and a small table arranged on the porch, all covered by the wide slope of the roof above. Summer’s heels thudded across the wooden floor leading to the door, and she couldn’t deny the wonder captivating her soul. 

They get to the artistically crafted door as the screen door enclosing the screened up porch swings shut behind them. Mother’s door is carved out of a single piece of wood, one that looks both sturdy, and heavy. It’s painted a deep green, but on closer inspection appears to maybe just *be* green? An assortment of designs are carved into the wood, and Summer recognizes a few of them being Egyptian hieroglyphics, Greek letters, and another Celtic symbol. Those, along with others she cannot place, are arranged along the edges of the door, with other strange sigils carved around the translucent glass arching from the middle left, reaching close to the center top, then bending back down to an end on the middle right side. The silver door knob has polished stones set into it, with what could very well be an emerald at the top, an amethyst on the left, ruby below, and something blue… *lapis?* on the right.

“It’s not going to bite,” Mother says, and Summer can hear the smile in the old woman’s voice without even seeing it.

Her hand trembles as she reaches out for the doorknob, but she can’t fathom why. She’s nervous, excited, apprehensive, and captivated by the appearance of the door, and fights through the confusion of why it has inspired such emotions while forcing her hand to the knob. A shiver rolls up her arm as she clutches the finely designed knob, and an exhausted sigh spills from her lungs. There’s a strange sense of invigoration while her fingers close around it, and she is unable to keep herself from smiling when the knob turns with her hand.

As expected, the door *is* heavy. It takes a surprising effort for the young woman to push it open, and she briefly wonders how Mother is able to move the bulky door on her own. The mental question vanishes after ushering the older lady inside, and Summer gasps when her eyes get their first taste of what lies beyond.",1,1731878911.0,story,0,1.0,False

1gto68c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1gto68c/summer_tyme_with_the_collectors_chapter_11/,Summer Tyme with the Collectors: Chapter 11,"**Father Time**: *Often considered the oldest of all fairies, Father Time has earned a place in the upper echelon of the faerealm. He is often depicted as being an elderly man with a long, white beard, though his appearance and age can vary greatly.*

*This fairy has a near-mastery of time, and its effects on the worlds and those who inhabit them. He can influence the flow of time, making it appear faster or slower as he sees fit, and can even put time on an individual’s side. His power comes from eons of worship and praise from the fairy and human worlds, as he was perceived as a god in both. As such, Father Time doesn’t have to lower himself to serve anyone, and has built a vast empire in the faerealm to continue feeding his access to magic.*

*It is rumored that a group of druids or warlocks harnessed his abilities during a ritual hundreds of years ago. These individuals allegedly locked portions of his power away into carefully crafted items, most resembling watches. Those lucky enough to possess such a trinket would be granted a mere fraction of Father Time’s abilities, but also surely find themselves targeted by devout followers, artifact collectors, and even the faerealm’s enforcement agency - Silver Nest.*

Summer jolts awake, sitting upright with the blanket spilling down her front. The sheet cascades down into a crumpled heap around her belly while her mind swims through the crumbling remnants of her dream. Frightening images and words echo in her head, diminishing and dwindling with every repetition until only pieces remain. She snatches her phone from the small table beside her bed, eager to confirm it *had* all just been a dream.

She creates a text group with her younger siblings and types in a few messages. “Had a terrible dream - Are you ok?? - I know it’s stupid, but I’m worried.” Only after the hurried messages show as ‘*delivered*’ does she allow herself to breathe. Her eyes remain on the illuminated screen of her phone, and she watches the clock at the upper corner of her device switch to a new minute.

“5:44 a.m.” stares up at her. It’s still one full minute before her first alarm is set to activate, and she allows a smirk to tug at her face with the knowledge it’s the first time she has woken up without the immediate need to rush into the shower. She isn’t worried about waking her brother or sister, considering they still live fairly close to home - two time zones away. Her sister, Dawn, was the first to reply, which Summer fully expected. “Fine here, you?” she responds, quickly followed by, “Isn’t it early there?”

A relieved sigh spills from her chest as Summer types in another message. The dream had felt so *real*, but that hardly made it unique. All dreams feel real when you’re in them, and the young woman felt foolish for even entertaining the idea that anything had happened to her siblings. “It’s about time for me to get up anyway, just glad you’re ok,” she replied, and had just hit ‘*send*’ when her brother, Nox, sent his own message. “I’m good, too”

Summer smiles while talking with her brother and sister, only now realizing how long it had been since the last time they communicated. It felt wrong to have spent so much time away, or to go over a month without so much as a text to them. True, they could have initiated the conversation, but Dawn and Nox were busy with their own lives. Finding time to openly talk was getting harder and harder.

The second alarm interrupts their conversation, alerting Summer to the hour. “6:00 a.m.” is right there in the corner, and she knows she needs to get up if she is to have enough time for her full morning routine. The last couple of days have started with a rushed shower, haphazard outfits, and no breakfast. This morning was already off to a much better start, and she was ready to keep it going.

Over the invigorating scents of shea butter soap, ocean breeze shampoo, and lavender conditioner, came something unexpected. Summer pauses after dragging her new razor up the length of her shin, letting this new smell tickle her nose until it struck something familiar. Her mouth began to salivate, and she smiled at just how good of an idea it was to take on a leprechaun as a roommate. 

The alluring smells of bacon, eggs, sausage, toast, and other morning delicacies continue strengthening as she finishes in the shower, and she pokes her head out the bathroom door after wrapping her hair into a towel. Down the hall and doing a little jig in the kitchen is her green-clad friend, his back to her while tending to something on the stove. She can barely see him around a corner at the end of the hallway, but takes another few moments to watch the magical man dance while something sizzles on the pan in front of him.

With a hint of blush applied to her cheeks, a neutral shade of lipstick on her lips, and her usual violet framed glasses hugging the bridge of her nose, she slips back into her room to put together an appropriate outfit for the day. She lets the towel drop from around her, then steps out of the discarded nest around her feet while looking through her closet. Her heels click-clack down the hardwood hallway as she joins Gavin for breakfast, and she idly straightens her navy blazer over a matching skirt. The emerald green blouse was picked mostly for her roommate’s approval, which she more than received when he turned around to greet her.

“Mornin’, roomie- *Patrick’s floatin’ ghost!*” he exclaims, gripping the forest green apron hanging from his neck and tugging it to the side with one hand. His other hand adjusts the collar of his grassy shirt. “Lookin’ better’n a pot of gold this mornin’, if I may say so.”

Summer felt her cheeks turning red as she smiled at him, but let her eyes drift over the assorted options for breakfast he arranged on the kitchen island. A plate of bacon sat beside another plate with easily a dozen sausage patties. There was a tray of scones, another plate with eggs that looked like they’d been prepared overeasy, and another flat tray with two mouthwatering towers - one made of pancakes, the other waffles. Nestled in the middle of all that was a pitcher of orange juice, one with apple juice, and a third that must have been coffee. 

“This all looks and smells incredible, Gavin,” she said with a wide grin.

“Well, figured I owe ya,” he replied, summoning a plate from the nearby cabinet. “What with givin’ me a place ta stay, gettin’ my gold back from that thievin’ Ralv, and all…”

“I would say not to worry about it, but…” Summer said playfully while Gavin filled the plate with enough breakfast to keep her full until nighttime, “...feel free to cook whenever you like.”

“And donchu worry about the mess,” he continued, “I’ll get it all cleaned up before ya get home.”

“Thank you,” she said sincerely.

The morning was off to a perfect start. If Summer was the cynical type, she might be expecting something awful to happen. Instead, she had a full belly, spring in her step, and a happy melody in her heart as she rode the bus to the office. A morning of covering for Mrs. Boggury while she was in court awaited her, as did lunch with her boss and the judge. It was looking like a great day full of learning and falling into her place in the world, and everything was just as it should be.

*Until* she arrived at the office. Summer walked into the office she shares with her affluential boss to find her in a bit of a huff. She has arrived early and watches as Mrs. Boggury sends the phone back into its cradle on her desk with a resounding *clack*, and her free hand floats up to idly trace the silver curves and bends on her enchanted pendant. ‘*Ever have time just… work out for you?*’ plays through her mind, perfectly replicating Gavin’s voice as she wonders if there really is something to it. The briefcase in her other hand brushes onto her skirt as Mrs. Boggury looks up at her, annoyance clear in her face.

“I’m sorry, Summer,” she starts. The tone in her words makes Summer’s heart drop, and she’s *certain* she is about to be let go. Her hand closes around the device hanging from her neck as Mrs. Boggury continues, “That was Mr. Flechbaum, *James*. He’s already at the courthouse and is dead set on taking the settlement, rather than hold the brokerage responsible. I have to get going, please take messages and field questions as best you can in my absence.”

Summer’s heart raced at the prospect of filling in for Vivian, even if for just an hour or two. She has taken the time to study all of the upcoming and active cases, but is still quite new to the field. While Summer feels qualified, doubts linger that she’s truly ready. Mrs. Boggury picks up on the young woman’s hesitation, and puts a reassuring smile on her face.

“I have every confidence in you, Ms. Tyme,” she says. “If you need anything, or are unsure, you can either take a message and we can work through it later, or ask another of the associates in the office for some help. You’ll do great.”

“Hold on,” Summer adds after setting her briefcase onto her desk.

She walks across the office to a wall of cabinets, opens one of the doors, and quickly finds the file she is looking for. Mrs. Boggury watches her young assistant with a smirk, waiting at the open door until Summer hands over the blue folder.

“How did you know?” Mrs. Boggury asks while examining the name on the tab.

“I didn’t, but figured it couldn’t hurt to make sure,” she replies.

“Flechbaum, James… can’t *believe* I nearly forgot to grab his file.”

“That’s what you have me for,” Summer offers, trying to disguise just how pleased with herself she was.

“Yes,” her boss agrees, slipping the file into her own briefcase.

There’s a moment of hesitation, but Mrs. Boggury pauses at the door for a second longer as if considering something. Summer is hopeful she’ll be able to accompany her to the hearing, but knows she is still much too new and unpracticed for an actual interaction. That would all come later, but she still had quite a bit of learning to do. 

“The judge on this case is an old friend. Impartial and unbiased, but a friend nonetheless. You may have noticed my blocked out lunch hour today? I would like you to join us for lunch today.”

Summer’s eyes are open wider than she realized, and she quickly blinks until they return to normal. The smile on her face remains, and she nods an enthusiastic reply. 

“Good, now… I’m off,” Mrs. Boggury announces, patting her charcoal gray suit jacket and scanning the office once again. “Unless there’s something *else* I’m forgetting?”

She flashes Summer a coy smirk, then turns and walks down the hallway. Summer remains in place, stunned at the interaction that just happened. It was just her third day, and she was already contributing to the success of her boss, and the firm. For the first time in a very long time, the young professional was *certain* everything would work out in the best way.

*Until* Mrs. Boggury returned just a half hour later. She moved through the open doorway with a groan, then turned and closed the door. Her forehead knocked against the broad barrier once, twice, then three times before she made her way to her desk. It didn’t take a body language expert to know that things probably hadn’t gone well, but Summer was apprehensive to ask. The silence was deafening, a smothering force beyond comprehension as Mrs. Boggury sat down.

“Hate to ask…” Summer begins, hoping the levity in her voice might ease any tension.

“Don’t,” Mrs. Boggury replied, glancing through emails with unfocused eyes. 

Summer nods solemnly, and starts finishing the notes she had prepared in her boss’s absence. There had been a couple phone calls, four emails, and one question posed to another associate, and she had painstakingly recorded it all. The silence doesn’t last long, however, as Mrs. Boggury starts talking again.

“Here’s a guy who invested his life savings-” she stumbles to a halt with a frustrated sigh, debating on whether or not the client confidentiality applied to her assistant. “I don’t know… just, they violated the terms and trust without telling him. Basically lost a huge chunk of his money on risky investments without approval, all to buy themselves out of those same investments. We can’t dig into their practices without a warrant, and we can’t get a warrant without sufficient reason. It’s just a mess…”

“He settled?” Summer asks, her brow furrowed behind the high frame of her glasses.

“He settled. For less than the sum they lost, but enough to satisfy his demands. We **know** they’re dirty, and this was the best chance to prove it and keep them from burning countless others out of-”

Vivian stops herself again. Their confidentiality clause assures clients that their business remains private, and she has gone to great lengths to build and retain such trust. Summer *is* an employee, but she hadn’t had any part in this case. While Mrs. Boggury has little doubt Summer would keep it all confidential, she hadn’t signed the contract alongside them. 

“I would love to vent more, but- It’s really nothing personal or anything. I know you wouldn’t spill any secrets or anything, but-”

“No need to explain,” Summer interrupts. “You’ve only known me for a couple days, I totally understand the hesitance.”

“We’ll have another opportunity, I’m sure,” Mrs. Boggury continues. “This was just the best opportunity that had been presented in *years*.”

“You can’t convince the judge to issue a warrant?” Summer offers.

“Not without sufficient cause. The brokerage has some *deep* pockets. I wouldn’t want to suggest they have the right people in those pockets as well, but it would be all too easy for them to make things harder for us here. We need something better than hunches, no matter how valid they may be.”

The door swings open before Summer can reply, and Mrs. Boggury’s mother strides in. She’s wearing a black, wide-brim hat with a green feather nestled into a scarlet ribbon hugging the dome over her head. That was just about all that was different in her attire today, and Summer found herself wondering if the older woman always wore the same violet suit jacket over a red-violet shirt with blue-violet slacks. Her cane was still the same, almost too short golden pole, but her hand was holding firm to an amethyst hook at the top.

“I have been *waiting* for **hours** for some assistance!” she announced loudly.

Her shrill declaration forced Summer into an alert posture, and she nearly felt her heart stop. The young woman glanced at her boss, and was surprised to see a calm expression combating one of amusement on her face. Summer relaxed a little, and let some of the tension ease from her muscles as she looked over at the older lady.

“I’m sorry, do you have an appointment, miss…” Mrs. Boggury started, clearly making an effort to keep a straight face.

“Is that any way to talk to your elders?” the older lady asked, raising her cane and pointing the worn end of it at her daughter. 

The two broke into laughter at roughly the same time, and Summer let herself follow suit. She wondered how often an interaction like this happened, and hoped it was frequent. Their mother-daughter relationship brought a fond happiness to her heart, and seemed to instantly improve Vivian’s mood. 

“Court was a mess today,” Mrs. Boggury confessed to her mother. “I’m honestly glad you decided to stop by for a visit.”

“Still too busy to go to lunch with your dear, sweet mother, though?” the older lady asked with a playful smirk.

“It’s…” Vivian starts, making a show of aggressively looking at her watch, “...you’re about three hours too early!”

“I’m making an appointment,” her mother responds flatly, keeping the sly smirk on her face.

“It just so happens my lunch hour has unexpectedly opened up, so you’re in luck.”

“And your rising star, here?” the aged woman asks, gesturing at Summer with the business end of her cane.

“Summer is always welcome to join,” Vivian agrees, turning her attention to her young assistant.

Summer felt the heat of awkward embarrassment burn in her cheeks as she fell into the center stage. Both of the other women seemed to be waiting for her response, but she was still trying to catch up to what Mrs. Boggury had said. Had lunch with the judge fallen through after the case had settled?

“Oh- yes, I would love to,” she starts, glancing at her boss as if searching for a clue. “We don’t have another meeting?”

Vivian shakes her head in response. There’s a clear annoyance behind her eyes, but Summer certainly wasn’t about to press for any information. Not yet, at least.

“I could certainly use her help in the meantime,” the older lady interjected, “since there are no meetings today?”

The request took Summer by surprise. She had only just started working at the firm, and had hardly put in a full day’s work. There was so much she could learn from Vivian, especially in their down-time. She didn’t like the idea of putting in hardly an hour before her work day comes to a close, but wasn’t about to voice such a concern.

“What do you think, Summer?” Mrs. Boggury asks, raising her brows while leaving the decision to her employee.

What was she to do? On the one hand, Summer is just starting out on her journey to become an amazing attorney. On the other hand, she doesn’t want to insult or hurt any feelings. Would something like that be held over her head in her career? It would be significantly more difficult to achieve her goals as an attorney after spending years under Mrs. Boggury’s wing, and she knew she could do the most good for everyone with this kind of experience.

“I would love to help,” she starts, making sure to pick her words carefully. “You’re sure the office can spare someone of my talents?” Summer finishes dramatically.

Vivian laughs in response, nodding her head while glancing at a new email on her screen. Summer looks to the older lady after getting permission from her boss, and hopes she’s not making some kind of mistake. 

“Remind you of someone?” the older lady asks Vivian with a grin. “It’s like getting stuck with you all over again.”

Summer shuts her computer down and gathers up her briefcase before following the older woman out of the office. She turns back just before stepping fully into the hall.

“Call if anything comes up?” she asks, though she wonders what Mrs. Boggury could possibly need from her at this point in her career.

“She’ll be fine,” the older lady says from a few paces away. “*I*, on the other hand, might expire before we reach the door!”

Mrs. Boggury shakes her head with a smile, laughing as Summer hurries after the older woman. It doesn’t take long for them to make it out the front door, and Summer joins the older woman on a journey to the bus stop. She asks internally about the older lady’s car, the Volkswagen beetle from yesterday, but decides to keep her questions to herself. Maybe she simply liked riding the bus?

“You know,” the older woman starts once they’ve found a pair of seats on the bus, “I still live in the very house your dear boss grew up in.”

Summer nods, but her mind wanders. What could this woman need with her? Why was she so quick to get on a bus with someone she hardly knew, with the intention of going somewhere she had never been? And why could she simply not remember this woman’s name? They had doubtlessly been introduced, hadn’t they?

“...and now she’s a grown, achieved attorney.” the older woman finishes as Summer falls out of her mental spiral. “I’m sure you’ll find it interesting.”

Rather than ask her name again, or what she was expected to be doing, Summer decides to smile and nod. It was a gesture that seldom let her down in the past, and she was certain it wouldn’t let her down now. Still, she hoped she hadn’t missed anything important, or appeared rudely vacant while the… *Mother*, we’ll say, was talking.

“Next stop is hours,” Mother explained, “and then it’s just a short walk. You’ll help me along, won’t you?”

Mother’s voice suddenly sounded different. Frail, in a way, yet… strong? Perhaps that wasn’t the right word. Summer searched her mind for the appropriate description, but hadn’t stumbled onto it as the bus screeched to a halt.

“Here we go,” Mother announced before rising to her feet.

Summer got up beside her and offered an arm. A warm smile crossed Mother’s face as she settled her hand in the crook of Summer’s arm. The dull tap-clack-thump of heels, flats, and cane carries the duo to the front of the bus, and Summer awkwardly helps the older woman down the high steps. Finally, they’re off the bus and taking a quick breather on the sidewalk before walking the rest of the way to Mother’s house, the house that watched Mrs. Boggury grow.

Excitement surged through Summer’s veins unexpectedly. Granted, she *did* respect Vivian, more than just as her boss. The woman had inspired her in so many ways, and was as close to a golden example as anyone could get. Even so, it wasn’t like Mrs. Boggury was any kind of idol. She wasn’t going to Disney World, or visiting Ryan Reynolds’ house. Why was she so giddy?

Mother stretches her back as they stand on the sidewalk. The realization hit suddenly, and Summer glanced around for a bus stop, or any indication that the bus would be expected in this spot. It was just a regular sidewalk in a residential area, nothing but cracked squares of concrete, neatly landscaped yards, a handful of trees, and surprisingly unique houses. Not the typical cookie-cutter style where every house looks the exact same, these houses all appeared individually planned, designed, and constructed.

“Back when architecture was an art,” Mother supplied, seemingly reading Summer’s mind. “This one,” she adds, pointing at the house right in front of them.

The walkway was made out of flattened, oblong stones, with each rock more than wide enough for whoever might be walking along the winding path. It twisted one way, curved back the other, and led them to the exaggerated porch of a simple, one story house. The porch extended from the door roughly eight feet, sitting all along the front of the house and tracing back around the left corner. There were rocking chairs, a bench swing, and a small table arranged on the porch, all covered by the wide slope of the roof above. Summer’s heels thudded across the wooden floor leading to the door, and she couldn’t deny the wonder captivating her soul. 

They get to the artistically crafted door as the screen door enclosing the screened up porch swings shut behind them. Mother’s door is carved out of a single piece of wood, one that looks both sturdy, and heavy. It’s painted a deep green, but on closer inspection appears to maybe just *be* green? An assortment of designs are carved into the wood, and Summer recognizes a few of them being Egyptian hieroglyphics, Greek letters, and another Celtic symbol. Those, along with others she cannot place, are arranged along the edges of the door, with other strange sigils carved around the translucent glass arching from the middle left, reaching close to the center top, then bending back down to an end on the middle right side. The silver door knob has polished stones set into it, with what could very well be an emerald at the top, an amethyst on the left, ruby below, and something blue… *lapis?* on the right.

“It’s not going to bite,” Mother says, and Summer can hear the smile in the old woman’s voice without even seeing it.

Her hand trembles as she reaches out for the doorknob, but she can’t fathom why. She’s nervous, excited, apprehensive, and captivated by the appearance of the door, and fights through the confusion of why it has inspired such emotions while forcing her hand to the knob. A shiver rolls up her arm as she clutches the finely designed knob, and an exhausted sigh spills from her lungs. There’s a strange sense of invigoration while her fingers close around it, and she is unable to keep herself from smiling when the knob turns with her hand.

As expected, the door *is* heavy. It takes a surprising effort for the young woman to push it open, and she briefly wonders how Mother is able to move the bulky door on her own. The mental question vanishes after ushering the older lady inside, and Summer gasps when her eyes get their first taste of what lies beyond.",1,1731878883.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

It’s still one full minute before her first alarm is set to activate, and she allows a smirk to tug at her face with the knowledge it’s the first time she has woken up without the immediate need to rush into the shower. She isn’t worried about waking her brother or sister, considering they still live fairly close to home - two time zones away. Her sister, Dawn, was the first to reply, which Summer fully expected. “Fine here, you?” she responds, quickly followed by, “Isn’t it early there?”

A relieved sigh spills from her chest as Summer types in another message. The dream had felt so *real*, but that hardly made it unique. All dreams feel real when you’re in them, and the young woman felt foolish for even entertaining the idea that anything had happened to her siblings. “It’s about time for me to get up anyway, just glad you’re ok,” she replied, and had just hit ‘*send*’ when her brother, Nox, sent his own message. “I’m good, too”

Summer smiles while talking with her brother and sister, only now realizing how long it had been since the last time they communicated. It felt wrong to have spent so much time away, or to go over a month without so much as a text to them. True, they could have initiated the conversation, but Dawn and Nox were busy with their own lives. Finding time to openly talk was getting harder and harder.

The second alarm interrupts their conversation, alerting Summer to the hour. “6:00 a.m.” is right there in the corner, and she knows she needs to get up if she is to have enough time for her full morning routine. The last couple of days have started with a rushed shower, haphazard outfits, and no breakfast. This morning was already off to a much better start, and she was ready to keep it going.

Over the invigorating scents of shea butter soap, ocean breeze shampoo, and lavender conditioner, came something unexpected. Summer pauses after dragging her new razor up the length of her shin, letting this new smell tickle her nose until it struck something familiar. Her mouth began to salivate, and she smiled at just how good of an idea it was to take on a leprechaun as a roommate. 

The alluring smells of bacon, eggs, sausage, toast, and other morning delicacies continue strengthening as she finishes in the shower, and she pokes her head out the bathroom door after wrapping her hair into a towel. Down the hall and doing a little jig in the kitchen is her green-clad friend, his back to her while tending to something on the stove. She can barely see him around a corner at the end of the hallway, but takes another few moments to watch the magical man dance while something sizzles on the pan in front of him.

With a hint of blush applied to her cheeks, a neutral shade of lipstick on her lips, and her usual violet framed glasses hugging the bridge of her nose, she slips back into her room to put together an appropriate outfit for the day. She lets the towel drop from around her, then steps out of the discarded nest around her feet while looking through her closet. Her heels click-clack down the hardwood hallway as she joins Gavin for breakfast, and she idly straightens her navy blazer over a matching skirt. The emerald green blouse was picked mostly for her roommate’s approval, which she more than received when he turned around to greet her.

“Mornin’, roomie- *Patrick’s floatin’ ghost!*” he exclaims, gripping the forest green apron hanging from his neck and tugging it to the side with one hand. His other hand adjusts the collar of his grassy shirt. “Lookin’ better’n a pot of gold this mornin’, if I may say so.”

Summer felt her cheeks turning red as she smiled at him, but let her eyes drift over the assorted options for breakfast he arranged on the kitchen island. A plate of bacon sat beside another plate with easily a dozen sausage patties. There was a tray of scones, another plate with eggs that looked like they’d been prepared overeasy, and another flat tray with two mouthwatering towers - one made of pancakes, the other waffles. Nestled in the middle of all that was a pitcher of orange juice, one with apple juice, and a third that must have been coffee. 

“This all looks and smells incredible, Gavin,” she said with a wide grin.

“Well, figured I owe ya,” he replied, summoning a plate from the nearby cabinet. “What with givin’ me a place ta stay, gettin’ my gold back from that thievin’ Ralv, and all…”

“I would say not to worry about it, but…” Summer said playfully while Gavin filled the plate with enough breakfast to keep her full until nighttime, “...feel free to cook whenever you like.”

“And donchu worry about the mess,” he continued, “I’ll get it all cleaned up before ya get home.”

“Thank you,” she said sincerely.

The morning was off to a perfect start. If Summer was the cynical type, she might be expecting something awful to happen. Instead, she had a full belly, spring in her step, and a happy melody in her heart as she rode the bus to the office. A morning of covering for Mrs. Boggury while she was in court awaited her, as did lunch with her boss and the judge. It was looking like a great day full of learning and falling into her place in the world, and everything was just as it should be.

*Until* she arrived at the office. Summer walked into the office she shares with her affluential boss to find her in a bit of a huff. She has arrived early and watches as Mrs. Boggury sends the phone back into its cradle on her desk with a resounding *clack*, and her free hand floats up to idly trace the silver curves and bends on her enchanted pendant. ‘*Ever have time just… work out for you?*’ plays through her mind, perfectly replicating Gavin’s voice as she wonders if there really is something to it. The briefcase in her other hand brushes onto her skirt as Mrs. Boggury looks up at her, annoyance clear in her face.

“I’m sorry, Summer,” she starts. The tone in her words makes Summer’s heart drop, and she’s *certain* she is about to be let go. Her hand closes around the device hanging from her neck as Mrs. Boggury continues, “That was Mr. Flechbaum, *James*. He’s already at the courthouse and is dead set on taking the settlement, rather than hold the brokerage responsible. I have to get going, please take messages and field questions as best you can in my absence.”

Summer’s heart raced at the prospect of filling in for Vivian, even if for just an hour or two. She has taken the time to study all of the upcoming and active cases, but is still quite new to the field. While Summer feels qualified, doubts linger that she’s truly ready. Mrs. Boggury picks up on the young woman’s hesitation, and puts a reassuring smile on her face.

“I have every confidence in you, Ms. Tyme,” she says. “If you need anything, or are unsure, you can either take a message and we can work through it later, or ask another of the associates in the office for some help. You’ll do great.”

“Hold on,” Summer adds after setting her briefcase onto her desk.

She walks across the office to a wall of cabinets, opens one of the doors, and quickly finds the file she is looking for. Mrs. Boggury watches her young assistant with a smirk, waiting at the open door until Summer hands over the blue folder.

“How did you know?” Mrs. Boggury asks while examining the name on the tab.

“I didn’t, but figured it couldn’t hurt to make sure,” she replies.

“Flechbaum, James… can’t *believe* I nearly forgot to grab his file.”

“That’s what you have me for,” Summer offers, trying to disguise just how pleased with herself she was.

“Yes,” her boss agrees, slipping the file into her own briefcase.

There’s a moment of hesitation, but Mrs. Boggury pauses at the door for a second longer as if considering something. Summer is hopeful she’ll be able to accompany her to the hearing, but knows she is still much too new and unpracticed for an actual interaction. That would all come later, but she still had quite a bit of learning to do. 

“The judge on this case is an old friend. Impartial and unbiased, but a friend nonetheless. You may have noticed my blocked out lunch hour today? I would like you to join us for lunch today.”

Summer’s eyes are open wider than she realized, and she quickly blinks until they return to normal. The smile on her face remains, and she nods an enthusiastic reply. 

“Good, now… I’m off,” Mrs. Boggury announces, patting her charcoal gray suit jacket and scanning the office once again. “Unless there’s something *else* I’m forgetting?”

She flashes Summer a coy smirk, then turns and walks down the hallway. Summer remains in place, stunned at the interaction that just happened. It was just her third day, and she was already contributing to the success of her boss, and the firm. For the first time in a very long time, the young professional was *certain* everything would work out in the best way.

*Until* Mrs. Boggury returned just a half hour later. She moved through the open doorway with a groan, then turned and closed the door. Her forehead knocked against the broad barrier once, twice, then three times before she made her way to her desk. It didn’t take a body language expert to know that things probably hadn’t gone well, but Summer was apprehensive to ask. The silence was deafening, a smothering force beyond comprehension as Mrs. Boggury sat down.

“Hate to ask…” Summer begins, hoping the levity in her voice might ease any tension.

“Don’t,” Mrs. Boggury replied, glancing through emails with unfocused eyes. 

Summer nods solemnly, and starts finishing the notes she had prepared in her boss’s absence. There had been a couple phone calls, four emails, and one question posed to another associate, and she had painstakingly recorded it all. The silence doesn’t last long, however, as Mrs. Boggury starts talking again.

“Here’s a guy who invested his life savings-” she stumbles to a halt with a frustrated sigh, debating on whether or not the client confidentiality applied to her assistant. “I don’t know… just, they violated the terms and trust without telling him. Basically lost a huge chunk of his money on risky investments without approval, all to buy themselves out of those same investments. We can’t dig into their practices without a warrant, and we can’t get a warrant without sufficient reason. It’s just a mess…”

“He settled?” Summer asks, her brow furrowed behind the high frame of her glasses.

“He settled. For less than the sum they lost, but enough to satisfy his demands. We **know** they’re dirty, and this was the best chance to prove it and keep them from burning countless others out of-”

Vivian stops herself again. Their confidentiality clause assures clients that their business remains private, and she has gone to great lengths to build and retain such trust. Summer *is* an employee, but she hadn’t had any part in this case. While Mrs. Boggury has little doubt Summer would keep it all confidential, she hadn’t signed the contract alongside them. 

“I would love to vent more, but- It’s really nothing personal or anything. I know you wouldn’t spill any secrets or anything, but-”

“No need to explain,” Summer interrupts. “You’ve only known me for a couple days, I totally understand the hesitance.”

“We’ll have another opportunity, I’m sure,” Mrs. Boggury continues. “This was just the best opportunity that had been presented in *years*.”

“You can’t convince the judge to issue a warrant?” Summer offers.

“Not without sufficient cause. The brokerage has some *deep* pockets. I wouldn’t want to suggest they have the right people in those pockets as well, but it would be all too easy for them to make things harder for us here. We need something better than hunches, no matter how valid they may be.”

The door swings open before Summer can reply, and Mrs. Boggury’s mother strides in. She’s wearing a black, wide-brim hat with a green feather nestled into a scarlet ribbon hugging the dome over her head. That was just about all that was different in her attire today, and Summer found herself wondering if the older woman always wore the same violet suit jacket over a red-violet shirt with blue-violet slacks. Her cane was still the same, almost too short golden pole, but her hand was holding firm to an amethyst hook at the top.

“I have been *waiting* for **hours** for some assistance!” she announced loudly.

Her shrill declaration forced Summer into an alert posture, and she nearly felt her heart stop. The young woman glanced at her boss, and was surprised to see a calm expression combating one of amusement on her face. Summer relaxed a little, and let some of the tension ease from her muscles as she looked over at the older lady.

“I’m sorry, do you have an appointment, miss…” Mrs. Boggury started, clearly making an effort to keep a straight face.

“Is that any way to talk to your elders?” the older lady asked, raising her cane and pointing the worn end of it at her daughter. 

The two broke into laughter at roughly the same time, and Summer let herself follow suit. She wondered how often an interaction like this happened, and hoped it was frequent. Their mother-daughter relationship brought a fond happiness to her heart, and seemed to instantly improve Vivian’s mood. 

“Court was a mess today,” Mrs. Boggury confessed to her mother. “I’m honestly glad you decided to stop by for a visit.”

“Still too busy to go to lunch with your dear, sweet mother, though?” the older lady asked with a playful smirk.

“It’s…” Vivian starts, making a show of aggressively looking at her watch, “...you’re about three hours too early!”

“I’m making an appointment,” her mother responds flatly, keeping the sly smirk on her face.

“It just so happens my lunch hour has unexpectedly opened up, so you’re in luck.”

“And your rising star, here?” the aged woman asks, gesturing at Summer with the business end of her cane.

“Summer is always welcome to join,” Vivian agrees, turning her attention to her young assistant.

Summer felt the heat of awkward embarrassment burn in her cheeks as she fell into the center stage. Both of the other women seemed to be waiting for her response, but she was still trying to catch up to what Mrs. Boggury had said. Had lunch with the judge fallen through after the case had settled?

“Oh- yes, I would love to,” she starts, glancing at her boss as if searching for a clue. “We don’t have another meeting?”

Vivian shakes her head in response. There’s a clear annoyance behind her eyes, but Summer certainly wasn’t about to press for any information. Not yet, at least.

“I could certainly use her help in the meantime,” the older lady interjected, “since there are no meetings today?”

The request took Summer by surprise. She had only just started working at the firm, and had hardly put in a full day’s work. There was so much she could learn from Vivian, especially in their down-time. She didn’t like the idea of putting in hardly an hour before her work day comes to a close, but wasn’t about to voice such a concern.

“What do you think, Summer?” Mrs. Boggury asks, raising her brows while leaving the decision to her employee.

What was she to do? On the one hand, Summer is just starting out on her journey to become an amazing attorney. On the other hand, she doesn’t want to insult or hurt any feelings. Would something like that be held over her head in her career? It would be significantly more difficult to achieve her goals as an attorney after spending years under Mrs. Boggury’s wing, and she knew she could do the most good for everyone with this kind of experience.

“I would love to help,” she starts, making sure to pick her words carefully. “You’re sure the office can spare someone of my talents?” Summer finishes dramatically.

Vivian laughs in response, nodding her head while glancing at a new email on her screen. Summer looks to the older lady after getting permission from her boss, and hopes she’s not making some kind of mistake. 

“Remind you of someone?” the older lady asks Vivian with a grin. “It’s like getting stuck with you all over again.”

Summer shuts her computer down and gathers up her briefcase before following the older woman out of the office. She turns back just before stepping fully into the hall.

“Call if anything comes up?” she asks, though she wonders what Mrs. Boggury could possibly need from her at this point in her career.

“She’ll be fine,” the older lady says from a few paces away. “*I*, on the other hand, might expire before we reach the door!”

Mrs. Boggury shakes her head with a smile, laughing as Summer hurries after the older woman. It doesn’t take long for them to make it out the front door, and Summer joins the older woman on a journey to the bus stop. She asks internally about the older lady’s car, the Volkswagen beetle from yesterday, but decides to keep her questions to herself. Maybe she simply liked riding the bus?

“You know,” the older woman starts once they’ve found a pair of seats on the bus, “I still live in the very house your dear boss grew up in.”

Summer nods, but her mind wanders. What could this woman need with her? Why was she so quick to get on a bus with someone she hardly knew, with the intention of going somewhere she had never been? And why could she simply not remember this woman’s name? They had doubtlessly been introduced, hadn’t they?

“...and now she’s a grown, achieved attorney.” the older woman finishes as Summer falls out of her mental spiral. “I’m sure you’ll find it interesting.”

Rather than ask her name again, or what she was expected to be doing, Summer decides to smile and nod. It was a gesture that seldom let her down in the past, and she was certain it wouldn’t let her down now. Still, she hoped she hadn’t missed anything important, or appeared rudely vacant while the… *Mother*, we’ll say, was talking.

“Next stop is hours,” Mother explained, “and then it’s just a short walk. You’ll help me along, won’t you?”

Mother’s voice suddenly sounded different. Frail, in a way, yet… strong? Perhaps that wasn’t the right word. Summer searched her mind for the appropriate description, but hadn’t stumbled onto it as the bus screeched to a halt.

“Here we go,” Mother announced before rising to her feet.

Summer got up beside her and offered an arm. A warm smile crossed Mother’s face as she settled her hand in the crook of Summer’s arm. The dull tap-clack-thump of heels, flats, and cane carries the duo to the front of the bus, and Summer awkwardly helps the older woman down the high steps. Finally, they’re off the bus and taking a quick breather on the sidewalk before walking the rest of the way to Mother’s house, the house that watched Mrs. Boggury grow.

Excitement surged through Summer’s veins unexpectedly. Granted, she *did* respect Vivian, more than just as her boss. The woman had inspired her in so many ways, and was as close to a golden example as anyone could get. Even so, it wasn’t like Mrs. Boggury was any kind of idol. She wasn’t going to Disney World, or visiting Ryan Reynolds’ house. Why was she so giddy?

Mother stretches her back as they stand on the sidewalk. The realization hit suddenly, and Summer glanced around for a bus stop, or any indication that the bus would be expected in this spot. It was just a regular sidewalk in a residential area, nothing but cracked squares of concrete, neatly landscaped yards, a handful of trees, and surprisingly unique houses. Not the typical cookie-cutter style where every house looks the exact same, these houses all appeared individually planned, designed, and constructed.

“Back when architecture was an art,” Mother supplied, seemingly reading Summer’s mind. “This one,” she adds, pointing at the house right in front of them.

The walkway was made out of flattened, oblong stones, with each rock more than wide enough for whoever might be walking along the winding path. It twisted one way, curved back the other, and led them to the exaggerated porch of a simple, one story house. The porch extended from the door roughly eight feet, sitting all along the front of the house and tracing back around the left corner. There were rocking chairs, a bench swing, and a small table arranged on the porch, all covered by the wide slope of the roof above. Summer’s heels thudded across the wooden floor leading to the door, and she couldn’t deny the wonder captivating her soul. 

They get to the artistically crafted door as the screen door enclosing the screened up porch swings shut behind them. Mother’s door is carved out of a single piece of wood, one that looks both sturdy, and heavy. It’s painted a deep green, but on closer inspection appears to maybe just *be* green? An assortment of designs are carved into the wood, and Summer recognizes a few of them being Egyptian hieroglyphics, Greek letters, and another Celtic symbol. Those, along with others she cannot place, are arranged along the edges of the door, with other strange sigils carved around the translucent glass arching from the middle left, reaching close to the center top, then bending back down to an end on the middle right side. The silver door knob has polished stones set into it, with what could very well be an emerald at the top, an amethyst on the left, ruby below, and something blue… *lapis?* on the right.

“It’s not going to bite,” Mother says, and Summer can hear the smile in the old woman’s voice without even seeing it.

Her hand trembles as she reaches out for the doorknob, but she can’t fathom why. She’s nervous, excited, apprehensive, and captivated by the appearance of the door, and fights through the confusion of why it has inspired such emotions while forcing her hand to the knob. A shiver rolls up her arm as she clutches the finely designed knob, and an exhausted sigh spills from her lungs. There’s a strange sense of invigoration while her fingers close around it, and she is unable to keep herself from smiling when the knob turns with her hand.

As expected, the door *is* heavy. It takes a surprising effort for the young woman to push it open, and she briefly wonders how Mother is able to move the bulky door on her own. The mental question vanishes after ushering the older lady inside, and Summer gasps when her eyes get their first taste of what lies beyond.",1,1731878860.0,u_ShaunDoed,0,1.0,False

She always said ""adult life is like this, we dont have time, etc"" but i'm nor blind nor deaf. She only ignores me and never hangs out with me.

While I love her, I feel like this is one sided. It became so unnatural. Hell, we can't able to go out even for a coffee. What kind of friendship is this? She always says me she loves me dearly and i should not overthink. But damn. This is not good for me. Feeling rejected tbh and completely clueless. Her words different than her actions and yes, I tried many times to speak with her, no luck. And I realized I don't even want to hang out with her anymore, because feeling tired of this.

Recently they started a house renovation and they don’t have bathroom. Although they live 5mins by car from their parents I offered them to come take a shower from time to time.

Since then they started to visit us twice a week, bringing also their clothes and asked if they can wash it. I said okay but honestly at this point my strings were pulled a little. It happened couple times more and since we felt a bit uncomfortable with this, we started to find excuses when they were asking if they can come for shower and to use washing machine. 

But the worst thing happened two weeks ago. We invited them to stay at our place - we were leaving for a weekend and thought it would be nice for them to stay at a normal place with a bathroom. They also took care of our cat during that time. After we came back the friend said that they’ve eaten something bad and sorry if toilet will be dirty… and it really was. They didn’t thank us or even cleaned up after themselves, the house was in worst condition than it was when we left it. 

This week they invited themselves to our house for a night and a girl spilled whole cup of coffee on my couch and didn’t bother to help cleaning, she was just laughing. She also said that sorry for hair in the shower but she needed to shave.

Honestly as I wrote it I realized how absurd this situation is. We have been friends with them for a long time and it’s the first time we see something like this. How would you politely handle this situation? Me and my fiancé have no idea how to approach it. We are all in our late twenties.",4,1731878549.0,etiquette,2,0.83,False

If you're here, welcome!  I've been running a long scale project where I aim to eventually run enough simulations on Brantsteele's Big Brother Interactive Template to include every single contestant that ever competed on Big Brother, regardless of which nation's version they appeared in.  This is part of a celebration for the franchise's 25th year anniversary since the filming of the first ever edition of the show, produced in the Netherlands in 1999.

For this first season, I divvyed up all 180 houseguests that competed on the show from 1999-2000 (included 2000 since 1999 only had one season) and divided them pretty evenly into 13 houses (same number of houses as real life seasons during that time), resulting in 13-14 houseguests in each.  I would then randomize everyone's relationship stats to each other, their popularity, and also their personality and challenge stats.  After adding in some custom events, it was time to run the simulation!   We've determined 13 winners from all of the editions, so now it's time to run one more simulation, to see who will be crowned our first ever Big Brother World Champion!

Each Big Brother World's house has a unique color and theme to it and this edition is no different!  This season finale will take place in the Falu Red House!

https://preview.redd.it/i3fqo35fzi1e1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b0dab91d2d40a1820c16cff1840dcab1a4df245

Falu Red is a very commonly used color for barns and sheds alike and it probably won't surprise you to find out that this edition will have a barnyard theme to it!  The indoors have a very wood heavy feel to it, the ceilings and furniture are wooden, the white walls and silverware and beds really pop against all that brown.  It's a pretty simple interior, but it's still fairly classy, given the appearance of a well to do (yet still ""simple and old fashioned"") farmer's home.  The backyard is where the barnyard theme gets fun.  This time, there are farm animals living with the contestants!  Chickens, pigs, and even an ornery goat named Bobby (Billy was too obvious a name)!   The houseguests will be responsible for taking care of these critters as part of their house tasks, success will earn the house perks, failure will result in privileges being taken away.  There's a chicken coop , pig pen, and in theory a pen for Bobby (who often escapes it).   When the contestants need a break away from the animals, there's a swimming pool too, which blessedly has been blocked off in it's own section of the backyard so that the animals don't get into the water.  This is going to be a crazy house to live in, fitting for the now veterans of Big Brother World.

And now it's time to go over the contestants for this season.  Since this is an all-winners cast, you know they've won the game before, but I'll briefly go over their key moments from their first showings just to catch you up!  Before I begin, I want to address the randomization aspect here.  I was tempted to just use everyone's same stats as last time, but I've ultimately decided against it.   After all, even if you've played the game before, every cast is different, every set of challenges are different, and the unique situations that you'll find yourself in will be different in a new game.  A smart player could make mistakes the 2nd time around, a fool can learn their lessons, and the new challenges can result in challenge threats looking weak and weak players suddenly becoming challenge dominators.  Your temperament could be different too.  So I'll randomize everything as usual here!   Buckle up friends, this is gonna be a long bit of typing!

Alex, 37, Bar Owner (Big Brother Germany 1) (Rose White House): Alex seems to have won more on the basis of what would seem to be a good social game than for anything else.  He was generally pretty terrible in the challenges, only winning one HOH (at final 4).  He was in an alliance, but his allies all got voted out during the midgame leaving him on his own.  Getting nominated 4 times, he'd be saved in two straight weeks (by two different people to boot!) and only receive 1 vote for eviction the entire season.  Perhaps seen as a non-threat, he was taken to the final two, where he'd pull off a narrow 4-3 victory.  Personality wise, he didn't do too much either, mostly just making art, a little bonding with the other final two member, a did have a banner fly overhead saying not to trust him.  Still, he flew under the radar for the most part, which might be harder to do this time.  Voting Record: 7-2 (meaning 7 people he voted out were evicted and 2 were not evicted).

Daniela, 29, Clerk (Big Brother Switzerland 1) (Coffee House): Daniela's attributes show a highly loyal, though apparently not at all strategic, player.   Perhaps that's why she hung with her only two allies for the entire game (they'd make the final three, even with one of Daniela's alliances breaking apart).   This loyalty, especially to her final two partner, probably helped her get through her many nominations.  Daniela had a pretty rival that would finish in 4th place.  Winning four HOHs, that rival ended up nominating Daniela each and every time they won HOH, forcing the Swiss lady to risk eviction several times.  A quit quite possibly saved her the first time, and she'd get votes against her every other round, Daniela would end the game with 4 votes for eviction.  While not at all incompetent at the challenges, it would take until the final 5 before she finally won her first challenge, but after that was strong, winning HOH at final 5 and 3 and also the final 4 POV.  That POV win allowed her to finally best her rival by getting to vote them out herself.  Her final two ally was a nutjob this season and that probably was as big a part of Daniela's unanimous 7-0 jury win as it was due to her own efforts.   As for house events, Daniela didn't have a great run, being one of several people to destroy a coffee machine (seriously, nobody knew how to make coffee in the Coffee House!) and was another victim of the ol' banner flies overhead to warn the other houseguests route.  Voting Record: A perfect 7-0!!!

Georgie, 26, Barman (Big Brother Netherlands 2) (Ice Blue House): Georgie might well be the best underdog winner we've had so far.  Never once being in a single alliance, having his personal items broken multiple times by his fellow final three members, a performing horribly in the HOH competitions, and not really having great stat draws (aside from his perfect ""5""s in General Challenge Competitions and Mental/Quizzes), I'm really surprised he pulled this off.  Getting nominated an impressive 5 times, he'd be saved three of those times (once by someone he had bonded with earlier in the season when they cuddled up in a blanket when they got cold).   He got pretty lucky with the veto big time.  The first time he was on the block, it was against someone in a pretty decently strong alliance I feel, and that person got saved by another member.  Had that person stayed on the block, I suspect Georgie would have been evicted.  Had he not won the veto during his 2nd nomination, I think the same.  The third time, he'd face that guy who saved the ally member earlier and that also found him creepy and told the other houseguests (more adversity, as if he had not faced enough yet) and would survive a pretty close 4-2 vote (the alliance being the 2 votes against Georgie).  The Dutchman would somehow only get 4 eviction votes against him, which seems remarkably low considering how often he was on the block.  Georgie would turn up the heat in the Ice Blue at the end of the game, winning the last four challenges, two HOHs and two POVs (He also literally turned up the heat when he and another guy discovered that they could use the stone stove to warm up).  This challenge run might well have been the difference in allowing him to win 5-2 against what I thought was a rather strong final two adversary.  What an upset win, but it may take even more luck if Georgie wants to win again.  Voting Record: 5-2.

Isabelle, 24, Waitress (Big Brother Belgium 1) (Sunflower House): A pretty strong challenge competitor that won three HOHs from the beginning of the game and through the final seven, Isabelle was pretty competitive in the challenges.  I'd argue that her very close friendship with the third place finisher (they even made out at one point!) was as much a factor in her making it deep into the game.  There was what could have been a dominant alliance that Isabelle would attack through her nominations constantly.  The only real time (at least till the final three) where she was in any real danger was when someone that she had nominated already twice won HOH.  No surprise then that Isabelle got nominated.  Her final three buddy would win POV that round and save her.  I could see her getting evicted if not for that.  None the less, her ability to make friends with everyone that made it to the final four is what got her through to the finish line.  When she was chosen over her 3rd place buddy to make it to the final two, I think it was clear that she'd win at that point, as the other member of the final two seemed to turn it up too little too late.  Isabelle never received a single eviction vote and would win the game on a 5-2 vote.  Aside from her make out session, Isabelle also had a memorable moment where she had a wardrobe malfunction, getting panted in front of everyone.  Generally a strong player, let's see if she can do it again!  Voting Record: 6-2.

Jana, 24, Freelance Phone Sex Operator (Big Brother Germany 1) (Orange Peel House): A player of extreme personality and challenge stats (she had all 1's, 2's and 5's, no 3 or 4s), I had the feeling during the entirety of the Orange Peel House game that Jana's success was never really in doubt.  Winning an impressive 5 HOHs and being in nearly every alliance that was made that edition, Jana was pretty overpowered the whole game.  That's not to say that there wasn't some adversity though.  She offend another houseguest, who'd throw a glass of Orange Juice at her, that person was evicted the next week (She'd also impress what would eventually be her final two partner by squeezing a glass of O.J. herself, so Jana certainly fit the orange theme well this edition).   She'd form a hell of a rivalry with the 3rd place finisher.  If I was doing an All-Stars styled run (I won't be, sorry to say), that contestant would be among the first I'd cast.  Jana would nominate her four times and yet the 3rd placer just wouldn't go away.  That's partially due to Jana failing to vote her out when she had the chance at final 7, due to a tie vote, she could have voted her rival out but didn't.  She'd probably regret that decision somewhat.  Her rival would also be the only person to ever nominate Jana and she did so twice, both times after Jana blew her first chance to get rid of her.  While Jana would stay on the block both times, she never received a vote for eviction, despite the threat she carried.  Jana would finally get one over on her rival in the final three, when she won the final HOH and evicted the other lady.  Despite her final two partner being a pretty strong challenge competitor himself and someone who only got nominated in the final three when he failed to win HOH, Jana would easily win the final vote 6-1.   This sort of dominant run was impressive, but can Jana do it again in the Falu Red House?  Voting Record: 4-2

John, 51, Former Professional Football Referee (Big Brother Netherlands VIP 1) (Inchworm House): Our oldest and most recent winner so far, John had an overall relatively easy path to victory, helped greatly by his game long alliance with his fellow final two member.   It wasn't all sunshine and lollipops, though.  He'd actually be nominated in the first week, only for his final two partner to save him.  This actually happened twice, as the 5th place finisher proved to be something of a nuisance to John's early game, but in both cases, his closest ally saved him.   Socially, the only notable thing John did was stare at a bug terrarium for a while, creeping the other houseguests out a little but that didn't do much to hurt his game.  The final two partnership was fun to watch, as they did pretty well dominate the game (John himself winning 4 HOHs and 2 POVs), but still had to deal with their hiccups here and there (mostly due to the 5th place finisher).  One could have made the case for the 2nd place finisher to win the game, given he was in more alliances, won as many challenges as John did, and even only got nominated one time (though it was a close one, it took a HOH tiebreaker for him to survive).  Still, John seems to have played a rather strong game too and never got an eviction vote either, so in the end, he'd win a 6-1 vote, no doubt he probably had better social skills than his final two mate.   He was a little cutthroat (he actually sort of backdoored the 7th place finisher.  Winning the veto and saving one of his nominations to place him on the block instead and even cast the tiebreaker HOH vote to get rid of him despite never nominating him before or being nominated by him), and he might just need to be again to win.  Voting Record: 5-2

Katrijn, 21, Student Fashion Management (Big Brother Belgium 1) (Amethyst House): From our oldest winner to our youngest, Katrijn didn't have super strong stats going her way (only in Mental Challenges did she score anything higher than a ""5"").  She also really didn't (in my opinion) do all that much during this game.  I mean, she did, but I feel like the 2ne place finisher did a lot more to deserve the win, making several alliances and seemingly being more in control of the game.  Katrijn seems to have really benefitted from being allies with the other finalist, especially when at the final 9, a 6 person alliance was made.  After one of those allies got evicted at final 9 (Katrijn being the other nominee), the alliance pretty much picked the outsiders off one by one.  This helped Katrijn a lot, since she got nominated 4 times during the course of the game.  To Kat's credit, she did win 3 challenges (2 HOHs and 1 POV), including winning the last POV (to get herself off the block and cast a critical vote that helped her odds at making it to the finale) and also the last HOH (to get rid of what was possibly the only real threat to beat her), so she did just enough at the end of the game.  Still, she got 3 eviction votes (including one from one of the members of that big alliance in what seems to be an attempt to backstab her, which failed.  The HOH that round probably would wish she'd have also betrayed Katrijn as she'd be the one Kat would vote out at final 4, keeping that player from possibly making the finals instead).  Socially, her only notable achievement was annoying everyone else during the end stages, not something you generally want to do.  Still, Katrijn would win the game by I guess being the lesser of two evils and that's good enough to get another crack at the game!   Voting Record: 6-3

Koos, 47, Driver (Big Brother Netherlands 2) (Licorice House): Koos is an interesting case.  He would win two HOHs in two of the first five weeks, but then seemed to just coast through the rest of the game, made possible by the fact that he was in multiple alliances, all of which were really unusually successful.  He wouldn't lose a single ally until the jury phase had begun and never really did anything to disrupt his allies, so everyone mostly stayed loyal this edition.  It made it pretty easy for Koos to make it to the end and earn his 5-2 victory.  However, it wasn't a perfect game.  Both times Koos won HOH, he'd nominate the same two people and both times, they'd both survive, forcing him to settle for a third houseguest to get evicted.  He's actually pretty lucky that those two rivals only won one HOH apiece (Koos would be nominated in both those weeks, though only ever received 1 total eviction vote against him), because this could have been disastrous in the wrong circumstances.  He would call one of them out big time but later make amends with her and even briefly be allied with her too!  Socially, that was able the extent of Koos' game, mostly hang back and just float along as his allies got rid of anyone Koos wasn't alligned with and then slowly picking each other off.   Not the most satisfying way to win, but it certainly worked well for him.  Would that work again?   Voting Record: 4-3 (he actually tried to backstab his final two ally in the final 11, making that a closer vote than it should have been.  Lucky that didn't work considering that she took him to the finals with her!)

Marina D., 22, Telemarketer (Gran Hermano Spain 1) (Light Hot Pink House): A strong challenge competitor stat-wise (though no where near as much personality wise), the first of our two Marinas seems to have been in control for most of the game in the Light Hot Pink House.  Not that Marina always made it easy on herself.  She had an incident early on when she tried to improve relations within the house, only to then flip the mattress on someone (!).  That other person got evicted next (thanks to Marina winning HOH and then casting the tiebreaker vote on her) but that could have ended badly.  Marina did also have a funny incident where the 3rd place finisher tripped into the pool while carrying Marina, which was funny to write up.  Her relationship with that 3rd placer actually proved interesting to watch.  At the final 10, there was a 6 person alliance made, Marina being in it (the 3rd placer, not).  This alliance mostly picked the competition apart.  At the final 6 though, Marina would win the POV (one of two she'd win, to go with her 4 HOHs).  She'd actually SAVE her final three buddy, which guaranteed an ally of hers would leave (granted, the one who did leave had left the alliance by then).   That 3rd placer proved a ton out, winning the next HOH and then surviving being initially nominated in the final 4 (thanks to the runner up doing a backstab of her own!).   Only when Marina won the final HOH, did she finally get rid of her friend in order to take her ally (and probably easier win) to the end.  Marina would win 5-2.  Only being nominated in the final four, Marina never got an eviction vote against her, we'll have to see if she can play such a strong game this time and win again!  Voting Record: 8-1

Marina L., 23, Student (Grande Fratello 1) (Berry Blue House): The other Marina played quite a different game.  Not blessed at all with good stats (aside from a ""5"" in Mental/Quiz challenges and a ""4"" for Social Skills and a ""2"" for Strategic skills, Marina had all ""1""s, absolutely rotten draw), she would be a quiet player for the most part.  She never even had any house events whatsoever!  I didn't imagine that even being possible, but this edition had an event or two that you just don't expect to see in Brantsteele.  For example, there was an alliance of five people created... in the final five!  Like why would anyone ever make an alliance with the entire house, with no outsiders at all.  Very strange moment.  Marina wouldn't be in any alliances until the final 7, when a separate five person alliance was made, one that had a few betrayals made to it (thanks in large part to the runner up).  Marina seemed to be close to the 8th place finisher, though they never actually allied.  They would, however, get nominated together twice.  The first time, Marina would win houseguest's choice at the veto and chose the runner up, who would win it.  However, that person then saved the other houseguest!   That's rough!  Marina would survive after receiving the only two eviction votes that she would receive in the game.  The second time it happened, Marina would just win the veto herself, so that's good.   Marina would win 2 HOHs to go with her 1 POV and her quiet nature might have been just enough to pull off what I thought was a slight upset win, 4-3.  The runner up being backstab heavy might have been what made the result possible.  In any case, could another quiet game give Marina another win?   Voting Record: 6-3

Nicky, 31, Drag Queen (Big Brother Netherlands VIP 1) (Lavender Gray House): Nicky's skills set was quite generous to her, as only her General Challenge stat was less than a ""3"" (in this case, a ""1"" and I suspect the other challenge stats more than made up the difference).   This certainly helped her as she would win 7 challenges over the course of the season, quite impressive!  While Nicky was quiet at first strategically, she'd get in a pretty strong 6 person alliance at the final 9 (she had one previously with one other contestant, but that had broken up a while ago).  Socially, Nicky had a fun pillow fight with another (soon to be evicted) houseguest but otherwise seemed to get targeted a bit, including having her mattress flipped on her.  Then again, she and another houseguest got to trash talk someone too, so she seems to have been able to dish it.  A couple big moments for her were in final 8, when an ally, the 4th place finisher, won the veto, used it (even though the only non allies were already on the block).  Nicky would be the replacement and the 4th place contestant tried to betray Nicky (to be fair, Nicky had nominated her multiple times already by this point, albeit before the alliance was built).  The backstab failed (though Nicky received her only 2 eviction votes that round) and hilariously, after Nicky won both the HOH and the Veto, would herself use the veto on one of her own nominations and replace them with the 4th place finisher, karma!  In the end, Nicky was brought into the final two (oddly) and thanks to the runner up's generosity, Nicky would win the final vote 5-2.  Voting Record: 3-3 (A rather poor record, actually, maybe it's a good thing Nicky was good at the challenges!)

Paulo, 31, Electrician (Big Brother Portugal 1) (Ferrari House): Our first Big Brother World winner had a pretty darn average stat run, all ""2""s, ""3""s, and ""4""s.  Paulo also is a story of a great comeback.  He didn't start off well, making annoying toilet humor jokes that annoyed everyone.  He also only had one ally the whole game (which broke up by Week 3).  Worst, he'd be nominated 5 times over the course of the game, including a rough 3 straight week run.  In the final ten, on the block for what was then the 2nd straight week, there's every chance that he might have been evicted then and there.  However, due to another player quitting, that round's eviction was cancelled!  Paulo would still get nominated a lot, but that helped big time.  It wouldn't be until the final 7 when he'd finally win his first challenge, but once he did, he won plenty down the road.  He'd win 3 HOHs (at finals 7, 5, and 3) and a veto at final 4 to keep himself safe.  The only time he was vulnerable during that time was in final 6.  He had been HOH the previous week and cast a tiebreaker vote to evict one houseguest.  He chose well, since he got nominated with the other person at final 6 and survive a 3-0 vote.  Paulo would get 4 total eviction votes.   Finally, he did seem to settle down after that rough start, even apologizing for his behavior not once, but twice.  It all seemed to be enough for him to win in the final two with a 5-2 vote.  Can he avoid a rocky start again?  And can he finish strong for a second time?  Voting Record: 6-1

Ricardo (V), 30, Surfer, Writer, and Theater (Big Brother Portugal 1) (Kaitoke House): He had bad Social Skills and Temperament stats (both ""1""s), but Ricardo's stat line was otherwise not too note worthy.  Looking at the alliances early game, this was a competitive season, let's of alliances going on there, only one person WASN'T in an alliance early game, this contest could have went several ways!  Lucky for Ricardo, his alliance proved to be the best one, as they won some early challenges and mostly just got to watch the other big alliance get picked off one by one.  Ricardo, compared to his final two counterpart, mostly played pretty quiet.  His only social events mostly involved the two of them, first the runner up pulling the old water bucket on top of the door prank on him, and later them bonding strongly over strategy (helps that they were allies from the start).  There was something of a public enemy number 1 in the house that would get nominated a lot but keep surviving. That person would be the first person to nominate Ricardo (where he'd survive getting his only eviction vote), which seemed to wake him up a little.  Ricardo would win three challenges the whole season (2 HOHs and 1 POV).  While the runner up had a far bigger spotlight on her than Ricardo did throughout the game, it was in a lot of ways a bad thing, since she got into trouble a lot.  It's probably the reason Ricardo was able to win a close final two vote, 4-3.   The eyeball test suggests that he played a really good game though, let's see what he can do with another shot.   Voting Record: 6-2.

And with that, we've concluded the first ever season of Big Brother World!  I want to give a huge thank you to everyone that's read through this series!  I've had a great time doing this and I hope you've enjoyed following along!   There will be a second season for sure of Big Brother World, however it will take a little while to get that going.  I'll have a lot of set up to do (getting cast photos together in a useable format for Brantsteele, doing research, picking out themes for each house) plus I have a very busy few weeks coming up (and after that is the holidays!).  So I'll admit, I'm not entirely sure exactly when I will be back, but be back I absolutely will be!  So please look forward to Big Brother World 2!

Hear me out.
I've been living in London for the past 7 years and I love it here.

However, there is one thing that's always felt like this town is missing- a vibe I grew up with but only ever comes out here in summer- For example: the truly relaxed feeling you get in like outdoor seating of a cafe or restaurant, maybe just coffee, maybe day-drinking, maybe smoking some weed and shooting the shit with friends or strangers.

I grew up in the mediterranean, and every Friday, rain or shine, people have the same ritual: grab a seat at their local establishment, some friends or another regular would join and they just vibe.
Came back from a business trip to the Bay Area recently, and experienced similar vibes in San Francisco.

So to anyone familiar with what I'm talking about- have you found someplace like that in London? Or is it just a matter of building that community myself?

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

So it’s yellowish there and throughout the day I have a whiteish coating towards the front. That part can be managed with brushing but it usually returns… even after I brush my teeth and tongue, there just seems to be a sourish taste toward the back and top of the roof of my mouth.

She had her back facing me the entire time so I was worried about popping in front of her and randomly annoying her, but I had whole speech planned and knew how I was going to approach her. Some more people got up to leave so she was really all alone in the corner, and it was perfect. I got up to go to the bathroom to check myself out and when I came out, it was 3 pm and she was starting to pack up her stuff and leave, and so I thought I shouldn't bother her while she's trying to go home and maybe eat lunch or whatever. She turns around and she's gorgeous and super cute with a white jacket vest thing and leggings and these brown boots. I immediately think she way out of my league and sit my ass down and realize that I took too long to take the shot and now I'm sitting here regretting not approaching earlier.

[Stream with timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/live/VdpMI3zyqbw?si=2BGlaxpy3CZPw2h3&t=11391)

Destiny ended up reading through one of the sources which was [a motion to quash an indictment due to lack of evidence.](https://freespeechforpeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20240930_motion_fld_to_quash_indictment-dft_104715112_ocr.pdf)

The source talked about the possibility that the election results could be manipulated because election officials had access to the SQL databases that contained vote tallies and could manipulate those databases. Destiny's explanations of what was being alleged (and the document itself) didn't make a lot of sense to me. Destiny was responsible though and caveated his analysis repeatedly with ""I'm not an expert on any of this.""

Since it sounded fishy, I decided to do some more digging. I made a separate post here about why the claims didn't make a lot of sense based on my understanding of how these databases worked, but I also found that the person who wrote this analysis was Jeff Lenberg.

Jeff Lenberg was one of the experts involved in the voting system breach in Coffee County, GA.

Source 1: [https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/politics/michigan-voting-machine-plot-charged-lambert/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/politics/michigan-voting-machine-plot-charged-lambert/index.html)

Source 2: [https://americanoversight.org/co-defendants-and-unindicted-co-conspirators-what-public-records-reveal-about-trump-allies-election-denial-activities/](https://americanoversight.org/co-defendants-and-unindicted-co-conspirators-what-public-records-reveal-about-trump-allies-election-denial-activities/)

>Lenberg is an election denier who visited the [Coffee County elections office](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/09/06/coffee-county-georgia-breach-logan/) in 2021 with Doug Logan to access voting data. Lenberg was also named in the 2022 investigation into the alleged [voting machine breach](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/07/michigan-nessel-seeks-special-prosecutor-election-conspiracy-probe-deperno/10249508002/) in Michigan, but was not charged with any crimes.

Allegedly, he wasn't charged because he successfully claimed that he wasn't aware that his investigation was illegal. He thought he was part of a legal investigation into voter fraud.

**BACK TO THE SUBSTACK:**

The citation of this source in the substack was NOT to argue voter fraud. It was to argue that people close to Trump had illegally obtained access to the voting software itself (which is a concern in and of itself). Lenberg was one of these people who illegally gained access. None of what I'm saying is in support or against the claims in that article to be clear.

**BOTTOM LINE:**

Remember to be skeptical with ""evidence of voter fraud"". Trumples spread a ton of bullshit claims about voter fraud and while most of these are pretty obviously bullshit, some of them can be pretty convincing. This one was convincing enough to even have Destiny speculating about how big of a problem it was.

Check the source of the information you're looking at and be careful speculating on things outside of your areas of expertise. There's a reason these things play out in courtrooms and that mainstream media relies on experts to vet information. It's easy to make something sound convincing when you're relying on people to not understand technical issues.

And remember that there are a lot of election fraud conspiracy theories flying around out there. Let's try to be better than Trumples and approach them with a lot of skepticism.",3,1731878283.0,u_beepingslag42,1,1.0,False

We seem to exist in completely different versions of reality. 

This has become quite apparent to me when I went for coffee with a girl today I got to know recently. On the second half of our conversation, she started talking about feminism, how unfairly women are treated by society, how privileged men are and how men are a threat to women. And while I can empathize with her sentiment, her narrative felt quite distorted and -quite frankly- sexist. I tried to meet her half way and wanted to show her, that men struggle in their own ways, that the grass on the other side is just as brown as on hers and it's not all sunshine and lollipops and that we (the sexes) have to come back to a mutual understanding of and empathy for each other instead of resentment. Needless to say that I didn't get through to her. She was pretty much hellbent on her narrative and her victimhood. 

Regardless of my best efforts to show understanding and calm the waves, it's very unlikely that we'll come to an agreement in the future. And that gave me to thinking.

How do we handle people like that. How can we convince them, to reconsider and look at the facts? ",7,1731878190.0,IntellectualDarkWeb,24,0.65,False

3 kids, 2 dogs, hubby and myself/
3 beds, 1.5 baths/
Laundry Room/
Kitchen, dining room, living room, small foyer room/
Backyard/
Basement (half finished).

On the first floor are Laundry room, half bath, kitchen, dining room, living room and foyer

3 bedrooms and full bath on top floor. Every bedroom has a decent closet with shelves. Both bathrooms have no storage. There are no closets at all on the first floor. Basement (furnished part) has a couch, a built in bar, and my husbands computer desk. There is one closet in the basement. The unfinished part has our boiler/heater/etc with room for storage. Theres a small crawl space in this room too.

The issue is between hubby and I. If it were up to me— our house would be minimalist. He thinks it’s impossible with 3 kids (Ages 9, 3 and 1). He thinks we need more storage and organization in our house and that would fix our problem. To me—more furniture (even if its for organizing) means more of a cluttered feel. Our biggest issue is really with the first floor. Heres the big furniture pieces we have:

Foyer- peloton, dog cages (2), coat rack, shoe rack, stroller, small shoe tray for wet shoes

Living room - (smallest space) - Giant sectional couch, large bookshelf, small bookshelf, one seat of sectional couch that is supposed to go in the basement but husband refuses to move (because he wants to work on the basement), floating entertainment center with TV on top, coffee table

Dining room- dining room table, small table for kids with 2 chairs, giant end table with dog food on top, play car (little tikes ride on car), high chair.

Our laundry room has a table in it with random supplies on it (think toilet paper/paper towels, tote bags), a washer and dryer. 

The issue is our house has so much stuff but nowhere to put it. I think it looks disorganized and messy. We have kids toys in small cheap cloth containers on top of our coffee table. Papers are everywhere throughout the house. We have nowhere to put mail (my husband keeps suggesting a small table in the foyer). We have constant arguments about the set up of our house. We need help/ideas on how to make our space more functional.

Pros:
Lots of kitchen cabinet storage
Room to work with in the laundry room
Basement has room for storage

Sometime around the end of September, I was inspired and a bit angry. I am a student and don't have that much free time but that is no excuse for spending that time on doomscrolling, social media.... I decided to start learning something new. I started going to the gym since August, to learn new skills like cooking, and this inspired me to give myself a challenge. I like hard challenges. As I said, I´m from Slovakia so Slavic languages would be easier for me and would not benefit me in the long run, that is why I chose French as my next challenge. I started learning basic about 2 months ago and I'm still learning, it's not easy but I want to give it something every day, even if it is just one Duolingo exercise and some new words. Here is a list of what I am doing and going to do to learn French:

\- Reading A1 French text on [lingua.com](http://lingua.com)

\- Duoling exercises

\- Coffee Break French podcast (currently on S1E14)

\- Writing a personal diary at least 3 times a week, trying to write a lot of basic words so I can remember them such as colors, directions, time and date (hours, days, seasons, months), family members...

I am trying to surround myself with the French language as much as possible. For instance, I am currently watching a French movie, ""Dissidente 2023,"" with French subtitles. I translate the subtitles, and after 10 minutes, I replay the movie back so I can hear and try to understand the talking and native speaking. I will do this until I watch the whole movie this way.

For learning I also bought a French grammar book, It is called Oui maturita solutions, It is basically a book that is for students who want to graduate in French. I also have a few apps but I don't use them that much, some of them are: Anki, Dr French, reword French.

If you have any insights, ideas or anything that would you like to share with me, whether it is positive/negative, PLEASE DO! The best people I can ask for advice are the ones who are learning too or know the language already and those people are people in this community.

*EDIT, just realized most of my learning is centered around vocabulary and reading/understanding, but I dont have anything to work on my pronunciation and speaking, any sugestions/ideas/advice?*

I will try to write this Journey on a daily basis. Wish me luck!

love this sub and really appreciate the recipes and conversation on this sub.

I've searched everywhere and I only get results about why letting the water drain all the through, compacting the grounds, is bad. but that’s due more to gravity with a paper filter running up the sides affecting the extraction. I’m familiar with that. But I had the same question for aeropress.

  
With an aeropress the sides are non-permeable and part of the process is forcing the water through with the press. So my question is what happens/how does it extract if you let all the water drain through and the grounds compact on itself. What happens when you put more water and press? And what happens to the grounds sitting in residual hot water in the time that you left it between pours?

  
Thanks in advance! I try not post questions that might’ve been answered or have easy answers. So apologies if this is found somewhere but I really couldn’t find an answer for this anywhere.

The obvious, at least one smiling photo so that we can see you have all of your teeth. Or don’t. If all of your photos are RBF, well maybe you’re a bitch? Just kidding I know that’s not fair. A lot of people are camera shy and I get it but still at least try to smile and show some teeth even if it’s awkward. 

Get a friend or if you don’t have any at least so you trust to not run away with your phone to take a photo of you in front of something that’s iconic to your city. If you’re in Seattle, get a picture of yourself in front of the space needle. Or pikes market. Something that shows that you’ve actually at least been to that city. Especially if you’re exceedingly conventionally attractive as the scammers use typically one to three photos of an extremely conventionally, attractive woman usually in a tropical location. That’s great that you’ve been on a tropical vacation but if all your photos are in the tropics and you say you live in Nova Scotia. Well chances are we’re not going to believe you. I’m very comforted by a photo of you in front of a small, unique local coffee shop just a selfie in front of their sign that I know there’s only one of that business not a chain.

Bathroom selfies. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I like them because I never see the scammers  use them. Go ahead and show us all the crap you use to get ready. It’s all right. 

Crop your photos. It’s really easy. If you don’t know how to learn how. Make it so that we don’t have to screw around zooming in to see what you really look like. Crop the photo so it fits well in the screen of a phone. That’s great if you have a picture of you in front of the Eiffel Tower, but it better not be the only one and really we don’t really care. We’ve seen photos of the Eiffel Tower before.

Please show us at least one photo of your hair down. If you cut your hair short recently, make sure there’s at least one photo of you with your short hair and please do tell us in your profile that your hair is short now. It’s never a good idea to show waist length hair on your photos and show up to meet us in a pixie cut. Guys generally like long hair. Please be honest about your hair in your photos.

Please show your waist. I know I know if you don’t have one, we’re all taught how to drape clothes over us in a flattering manner so that if we’ve got a big belly, it’s hidden. Well, that’s great but it’s not honest. If I see photos of a woman in her profile, and she’s only showing her face or has clothes artfully draped to hide that potential hourglass figure than I figure she doesn’t have one. She’s got a big belly she’s hiding. Again, please be honest with your photos because so many times I’ve had women show up to a meet and greet and they are far larger than what their pictures indicated. You’re not going to win me over with your amazing personality while being dishonest in your photos. I’m just going to think you’re a dishonest person in general. No catfishing please, OK?

OK, I’m gonna have to wrap this up quick just got a call from my SB. She lost her wallet with the credit cards of mine with her name on them she carries and gas cards, and I have to make some phone calls.

Negatives.

Just saw one that inspired this post. That’s great that you have a really mean looking pitbull that you love more than anything and they’re gentle and wouldn’t hurt anybody. My SB has one she swears wouldn’t hurt anything and actually that one wouldn’t. But if you post a photo with that monster next to you well I’m not going to contact you. Ever.

Photos of you with your kids or your family or your brother or your pimp or your boyfriend or all your girlfriends. Just don’t unless you intend for all of them to be a part of our intimate relationship. I never ever contact someone with photos like that. It just demonstrates bad judgment on your part. Makes you look dumb.

Photos of you that are probably not you that are of someone who is extraordinarily beautiful, usually slender, Asian, skin that has never seen the light of day except for those photos. Yeah. You don’t live in California. Those are photos some scammer stole off the Internet. Photos of someone who is extremely conventionally attractive, and usually all in a tropical location or someplace in Europe when you claim to live in the US. Most of us can see through your bullshit. But if that’s really you? Don’t use photos like that because nobody is going to believe you who has two active brain cells to rub together.

OK, I can think of lots more but I really have to go make those phone calls.

Therefore, a 'light bulb' came on and it finally dawned on me why coffee and energy drinks made me feel so good physically.

Without a second thought, I went through my daily routine, brewed a cup of coffee, and enjoyed some light-hearted **coffee chats** with a few friends. It was the perfect way to kick off the day before heading out.

I decided to take a drive to one of my favorite places—the **mall.** The drive itself is something I look forward to; it’s a scenic route with vast stretches of open roads, gentle hills, and a breathtaking **bridge crossing**. The view of water glistening under the sun as you pass the bridge is simply magical. It’s a drive that clears the mind and sets the tone for the day. 🌉

Upon reaching the mall, I set three goals for myself:

1. Complete some **work-related tasks.**
2. Spend time **reading a book.** 📖
3. Start on a **new video editing project.**

With a clear plan in mind, I headed straight to **Barnes & Noble.** This place feels like a haven for creativity—a perfect blend of books, art, and quiet inspiration. I spent almost three hours there, sipping my favorite coffee, reading, and ticking off my to-dos. It felt productive and peaceful.

While wandering through the store, I came across these stunning **art pieces** (attached photo). Each one seemed to tell its own story, a mix of emotions and abstract beauty. The delicate colors, the imaginative strokes, and the depth in every canvas spoke volumes. Art like this reminds us that creativity knows no bounds—it’s a world where **dreams, thoughts, and emotions** come alive.

Once my work was done, I decided to stroll through the mall. There’s something captivating about observing people from all walks of life. **Husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, kids with their friends** everyone busy in their own world, shopping, laughing, and living their lives.

In this vibrant chaos, I noticed two little kids walking freely, completely engrossed in their animated conversation. For a second, I thought they were alone, but then I saw their mother keeping a watchful eye from a distance. It struck me how **a mother’s instinct never rests, always protective and caring.** (Fathers, don’t worry—your turn to shine will come in another post! 😉)

One of the unique challenges I set for myself today was to walk into a store, find something I really liked, and **not buy it.** A little test of self-control. I’m happy to report that I succeeded. 😄 It felt empowering to know I could enjoy the process without giving in to temptation.

And, of course, the mall itself has its quirks. In one corner is a **Tesla showroom**—a fully functional showroom right inside a mall! It’s incredible how sleek and modern it is, with people crowding around to get a glimpse of Tesla’s futuristic models. It reminded me of an **Apple showroom,** which also seems to have a magnetic pull. Whether or not there’s an offer, people of all ages flock to it like bees to honey. **Steve Jobs’ genius truly lives on.** 🍎

Finally, as I walked through the mall, it struck me how this space, even in its bustling energy, offers a sense of peace. A place where people are in their own world, undisturbed, yet surrounded by life. And when the weather outside is cold, this place becomes the perfect spot for a warm, leisurely stroll.

With the day winding down, I left with a sense of calm and accomplishment—a mix of creativity, connection, and quiet observations. Sundays like this remind me of the beauty in small moments. 🌟

1gtnnp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pune/comments/1gtnnp5/looking_for_a_completely_private_stay_near_pune/,Looking for a completely private stay near Pune. ,"Hi there,

My wife and I have had a really challenging and emotionally draining year, and I want to give her a peaceful, quiet weekend where she can truly relax. Ideally, I’m looking for a private villa or stay on the outskirts of Pune, preferably near a lake or forest, where we can be completely alone—just the two of us, with no outside interaction.

A private swimming pool would be a wonderful addition, and having a fully equipped kitchen is important since I’d love to cook for her. We don’t need cooks or caretakers.

I’m happy to splurge to make this experience as special as possible. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated, and I’ll send you nice coffee!

Thank you!",1,1731877540.0,pune,0,1.0,False

*San Francisco, FSA capital district.*

President Lee Oliver was called to the capital on very important matters, something that could decide the fate of the war. Murphy had insisted on this and so he came as well telling him about the importance of this. The balance of power was beginning to shift.

*""So what is it?""* 

""We made a recent breakthrough in communications and found something truly astounding.""

*""Well go on tell me..""* 

""It's better if I show you...driver to the Presidential office please.""

*""The office?""* 

Murphy looked at his watch.

""Shit we're already late.""

*""Late for what?""* 

""The meeting.""

After a brief 30 minute drive Murphy led Oliver insisted the building practically ran as they made their way to the office? Oliver expected this to be in the war room why was it in his office?

What came next shocked him. He expected a robot that hacked into Enclave files again, a robot that did..something at least.

What he was instead met with was actually two people. One from Iowa, who was a translator apparently flown out day of..he was tired and from the look of the table was already six coffees in. And the other person was a ginger woman in a tailored suit, she wore a small little badge that was shaped like a flag. A flag Oliver had read about in a pre-war book.

""Sorry we're late.""

[""Hello Mr. President""] 

The translator didn't even need to answer..it was German.

*""What's the meaning of this?""* Murphy spoke up. ""Mr President this is Claudi Kromer...she's President of the commission of the European Commonwealth..and is here to offer us a deal.""

*""A deal..what kind of deal?""*

[""We will send you men and material to help you fight your war against the Enclave in exchange for you to open for trade""]

Oliver heard the offer and then looked at Murphy.

*""Is there anything else?""*

[""We desire your Fusion energy and what its capable of.""]

Oliver's heart started pounding...not only were there other nations and powers on the planet...they were willing to trade. He wasn't president of one nation over millions of other broken states..he was one among equal powers. And so he unconsciously extended his hand towards this strange foreign woman who dared travel thousands of miles to get here somehow

*""Deal""*

1gtnin8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_softtechhubus/comments/1gtnin8/30_easytouse_python_scripts_for_automation/,30 Easy-to-Use Python Scripts for Automation,"[30 Easy-to-Use Python Scripts for Automation](https://preview.redd.it/085si3uzzi1e1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3c8236c0882a7254447617cf0d4a15cb9466a70)

# The Power of Automation

Let's be real: no one enjoys doing the same task over and over again, right? Whether it’s renaming files, scraping data, or even scheduling meetings, these repetitive tasks can drain your energy and waste your time. Luckily, there’s a solution—automation. And when it comes to automation, Python is the Swiss Army knife you need.

Imagine starting your workday with all your files neatly organized, your emails sorted, and your daily tasks already in front of you—all without lifting a finger. That’s the magic of automation, and it’s more accessible than ever, thanks to Python. This guide will provide you with 51 easy-to-use Python scripts that can help you automate various everyday tasks, saving you time, effort, and (let’s be honest) a lot of frustration.

Let’s dive into the scripts, grouped by category, to help you figure out which ones will make your life easier.

# Categories of Automation

You don’t need to be a programming wizard to get started with Python automation. These scripts are categorized based on common tasks you probably encounter every day. Whether you’re trying to organize your digital world, manage data, or optimize your personal productivity, there’s something here for you.

# File Management

If you’ve ever looked at your desktop or downloads folder and wondered how it got so chaotic, you’re not alone. Managing files manually takes time—time you could spend doing something far more productive or interesting. With these Python scripts, you can bring order to the chaos in just a few clicks.

# 1. Batch Renaming Files

Ever had to rename a hundred files one by one? It’s a nightmare. Batch renaming scripts can take the pain out of this process, allowing you to rename files based on a pattern, date, or even their contents.

    import os
    
    def batch_rename(directory, prefix):
        for count, filename in enumerate(os.listdir(directory)):
            new_name = f""{prefix}_{str(count)}.jpg""
            os.rename(os.path.join(directory, filename), os.path.join(directory, new_name))
    
    batch_rename(""/path/to/files"", ""image"")

# 2. Organizing a Messy Desktop

Your desktop is not a storage unit. This simple script can organize your desktop by moving files into categorized folders based on their file types.

    import os
    import shutil
    
    def organize_desktop():
        desktop = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser(""~""), ""Desktop"")
        file_types = {
            ""Images"": ["".jpeg"", "".jpg"", "".png"", "".gif""],
            ""Documents"": ["".pdf"", "".docx"", "".txt""],
            ""Audio"": ["".mp3"", "".wav""],
            ""Videos"": ["".mp4"", "".mov""]
        }
        for file in os.listdir(desktop):
            file_path = os.path.join(desktop, file)
            if os.path.isfile(file_path):
                for folder, extensions in file_types.items():
                    if file.endswith(tuple(extensions)):
                        folder_path = os.path.join(desktop, folder)
                        if not os.path.exists(folder_path):
                            os.mkdir(folder_path)
                        shutil.move(file_path, folder_path)
    
    organize_desktop()

# 3. Automating Backups

Backing up your important files is one of those things you know you should do but never actually get around to. This script makes it automatic, ensuring your data is always safe.

    import shutil
    import time
    
    def backup(source_folder, backup_folder):
        while True:
            shutil.copytree(source_folder, backup_folder, dirs_exist_ok=True)
            print(f""Backup completed at {time.ctime()}"")
            time.sleep(86400)  # Run every 24 hours
    
    backup(""/path/to/source"", ""/path/to/backup"")

# Data Processing

Whether you’re a data scientist or someone who just needs to pull together a report every now and then, automating data-related tasks can save you hours. Python is particularly powerful here with its extensive libraries for web scraping, data manipulation, and reporting.

# 4. Web Scraping for Market Research

Need to gather information on competitors or track prices? Web scraping lets you automate these tasks, so you can get the data you need without spending hours manually copying and pasting.

    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    
    def scrape_prices(url):
        response = requests.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        prices = soup.find_all('span', class_='price')
        for price in prices:
            print(price.text)
    
    scrape_prices(""https://example.com/products"")

# 5. Automating Data Entry

Data entry is boring and error-prone. This script can read data from a file, like a CSV, and automatically enter it into another application or database.

    import csv
    
    def automate_data_entry(csv_file):
        with open(csv_file, mode='r') as file:
            csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
            for row in csv_reader:
                # Simulate typing into a form or database
                print(f""Entering data: {row}"")
    
    automate_data_entry(""data.csv"")

# 6. Dynamic Reporting with Pandas

Need to generate reports that update based on real-time data? Python’s Pandas library can help you create dynamic reports without the hassle of manual data crunching.

    import pandas as pd
    
    def generate_report(data_file):
        df = pd.read_csv(data_file)
        summary = df.describe()
        print(summary)
    
    generate_report(""sales_data.csv"")

# Communication Enhancements

Keeping up with emails, meetings, and customer inquiries can feel like a full-time job. Thankfully, Python can help you streamline communication, so you can focus on more important work.

# 7. Email Filtering and Sorting

Tired of sorting through spam and newsletters in your inbox? This script can automatically filter and label emails based on content or sender.

    import imaplib
    import email
    
    def filter_emails(username, password):
        conn = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')
        conn.login(username, password)
        conn.select('inbox')
        result, data = conn.search(None, 'FROM', '""newsletters@example.com""')
        for num in data[0].split():
            result, msg_data = conn.fetch(num, '(RFC822)')
            msg = email.message_from_bytes(msg_data[0][1])
            print(f""Subject: {msg['subject']}"")
    
    filter_emails('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')

# 8. Automated Meeting Scheduling

Syncing calendars and scheduling meetings back and forth is the worst. With this script, you can automatically check availability and propose meeting times.

    import datetime
    
    def schedule_meeting(calendar, duration):
        for event in calendar:
            if event['status'] == 'free':
                print(f""Meeting scheduled at {event['start']} for {duration} minutes"")
                break
    
    calendar = [{'start': '10:00', 'end': '11:00', 'status': 'free'}, {'start': '11:00', 'end': '12:00', 'status': 'busy'}]
    schedule_meeting(calendar, 30)

# 9. Chatbot for FAQs

Need a simple solution for answering frequently asked questions in customer support? This chatbot script can handle basic queries, freeing up your time for more complex issues.

    def chatbot(question):
        faq = {
            ""What are your hours?"": ""We are open from 9 AM to 5 PM."",
            ""Where are you located?"": ""We are located at 123 Main St.""
        }
        return faq.get(question, ""I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that."")
    
    print(chatbot(""What are your hours?""))

# Task and Project Management

Managing tasks and keeping track of time can be overwhelming, especially when you’re juggling multiple projects. Automating some of these processes can help you stay organized and on track.

# 10. Daily Task Reminders

Need help remembering your priorities? This script sends a daily reminder of your tasks for the day.

    import datetime
    
    def task_reminder(tasks):
        today = datetime.date.today()
        print(f""Today's date: {today}"")
        for task in tasks:
            print(f""Reminder: {task}"")
    
    tasks = [""Complete report"", ""Respond to emails"", ""Meeting at 3 PM""]
    task_reminder(tasks)

# 11. Automated Gantt Charts

Visualizing project timelines can be a hassle, but this script automates the creation of Gantt charts to help you track progress effortlessly.

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pandas as pd
    
    def create_gantt_chart(data):
        df = pd.DataFrame(data)
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.barh(df['Task'], df['Duration'], left=df['Start'])
        plt.show()
    
    data = {'Task': ['Planning', 'Development', 'Testing'], 'Start': [1, 5, 10], 'Duration': [4, 3, 2]}
    create_gantt_chart(data)

# 12. Time Tracking Automation

If you’re working on billable hours or just want to know where your time is going, this script tracks how much time you spend on each task.

    import time
    
    def track_time(task):
        start_time = time.time()
        input(f""Press Enter to stop tracking time for {task}"")
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Time spent on {task}: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")
    
    track_time(""Writing article"")

# Development and Collaboration

For developers, automating repetitive coding tasks can save significant time. From testing to deployment, Python can help streamline your workflow.

# 13. Continuous Integration Scripts

Automating testing and deployment ensures that code is always working as expected. This script can run tests and deploy code automatically when changes are made.

    import subprocess
    
    def run_tests_and_deploy():
        subprocess.run([""pytest""])
        subprocess.run([""git"", ""push"", ""origin"", ""main""])
    
    run_tests_and_deploy()

# 14. Code Quality Checks

If you’re tired of formatting your code manually, this script automatically runs linters and formatters to keep your code clean and consistent.

    import subprocess
    
    def auto_lint():
        subprocess.run([""flake8"", "".""])
        subprocess.run([""black"", "".""])
    
    auto_lint()

# 15. Collaborative Document Updates

Keeping documents up-to-date across a team can be a nightmare. This script automates syncing notes or documents across platforms.

    import shutil
    
    def sync_docs(source, destination):
        shutil.copytree(source, destination, dirs_exist_ok=True)
        print(""Documents synced successfully"")
    
    sync_docs(""/path/to/source"", ""/path/to/destination"")

# Personal Productivity

From managing your time better to automating parts of your daily routine, Python can help boost your personal productivity and free up your mental space for more creative work.

# 16. Focus Timer

If you’re a fan of the Pomodoro technique, this script can automate your work and break cycles, helping you stay focused without constantly checking the clock.

    import time
    
    def pomodoro_timer(work_time, break_time):
        print(f""Work for {work_time} minutes"")
        time.sleep(work_time * 60)
        print(f""Take a break for {break_time} minutes"")
        time.sleep(break_time * 60)
    
    pomodoro_timer(25, 5)

# 17. Automated Journal Entries

Want to build a journaling habit but can’t find the time? This script prompts you to input daily reflections and saves them automatically.

    def journal_entry():
        today = datetime.date.today()
        entry = input(f""What are your thoughts for {today}? "")
        with open(""journal.txt"", ""a"") as file:
            file.write(f""{today}: {entry}\n"")
    
    journal_entry()

# 18. Routine Automation

Set up your daily routines effortlessly with this script that triggers specific tasks at certain times of the day.

    import time
    
    def daily_routines():
        morning_tasks = [""Check emails"", ""Review calendar"", ""Write to-do list""]
        for task in morning_tasks:
            print(f""Morning Task: {task}"")
        time.sleep(3600)  # Wait an hour before the next set of tasks
    
    daily_routines()

# Financial Management

Let’s face it—managing money can be stressful. These automation scripts simplify tracking your expenses, monitoring your investments, and even generating invoices.

# 19. Expense Tracker

No more manually updating your budget spreadsheet. This script automatically logs your expenses and keeps your budget updated.

    import csv
    
    def log_expense(description, amount):
        with open(""expenses.csv"", mode=""a"") as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            writer.writerow([description, amount])
    
    log_expense(""Lunch"", 12.50)

# 20. Investment Portfolio Monitor

    def check_stock_price(symbol):
        response = requests.get(f""https://api.example.com/stocks/{symbol}"")
        data = response.json()
        print(f""The current price of {symbol} is {data['price']}"")
    
    check_stock_price(""AAPL"")

# 21. Invoice Generation

# Highlights of Unique Scripts

Now that we’ve covered 30 scripts, I want to take a moment to highlight a few standouts that have made a real difference in my own workflow.

* **Batch Renaming Files**: This script has saved me countless hours when working with large collections of images and documents. Instead of manually renaming files, I can let the script do all the heavy lifting.
* **Web Scraping for Market Research**: Whether you’re tracking competitors or keeping an eye on price changes, automating web scraping can give you a serious competitive edge.
* **Automated Gantt Charts**: As someone who works with multiple projects, this script has helped me visualize timelines and avoid overbooking myself.

# Personal Experiences and Anecdotes

When I first started using Python for automation, I wasn’t expecting the massive boost in productivity it would bring. Take the **Web Scraping for Market Research** script, for example. I remember spending hours manually checking competitor websites, jotting down their prices and features. It was exhausting and error-prone. Once I set up the web scraping script, though, the data came to me automatically. I could simply run the script, grab my morning coffee, and within minutes, I had all the information I needed. That one script alone saved me hours each week.

Another personal favorite is the **Focus Timer** script. As someone who struggles with staying on task, the Pomodoro technique has been a lifesaver. But I found myself constantly checking the clock, wondering when my next break would be. After automating the process with Python, I didn’t need to think about it anymore. The script would tell me when to work and when to take a break, and I could just focus on the task at hand. It was like having a personal productivity coach sitting next to me, but without the pressure!

The **Automated Coffee Brewing** script might sound like a luxury, but let me tell you, it’s a game-changer. I programmed it to start brewing my coffee five minutes before I usually wake up. There’s nothing quite like the smell of fresh coffee greeting you as you roll out of bed. It’s a small touch, but it makes mornings feel a little more seamless. Plus, it’s one less thing to think about in my already busy day.

# Financial Management Scripts: A Real-World Example

Managing my finances used to be a headache. Like many freelancers, I had to juggle multiple invoices, track expenses, and monitor my investments. I’d spend hours each week updating spreadsheets, calculating totals, and making sure I didn’t miss a payment. But once I automated those processes with Python, everything changed.

Take the **Expense Tracker** script, for instance. I linked it to my bank’s CSV exports, so every time I made a purchase, the script automatically logged the expense. Tracking my budget became effortless. Instead of sitting down every Sunday to go over receipts, I could just glance at my expense file and see how much I’d spent that week.

Then there’s the **Invoice Generation** script. This one was a game-changer. I used to dread creating invoices—it felt like a necessary evil. But now, all I need to do is run the script, and it generates a professional-looking PDF invoice in seconds. It pulls in relevant client details, calculates totals, and even includes due dates. I just send the invoice off, and voilà—billing done without breaking a sweat.

The **Investment Portfolio Monitor** script has also been a lifesaver. I’m not the kind of person who wants to check stocks every day, but I do want to know when there’s a big movement. With the script, I get automatic alerts when any of my investments see significant changes. It’s like having a financial advisor without the hefty fees.

# Home Office Optimization: My Experience

Working from home comes with its own set of challenges, but Python has helped me turn my home office into a more efficient and productive space. The **Smart Lighting Control** script, for example, has been a surprising productivity hack. I linked it to the time of day and my calendar, so my lights automatically adjust based on what I’m doing. When I’m in a meeting or deep work mode, the lights dim slightly to reduce glare on my screen. During breaks, they brighten up to keep my energy levels high. It’s a subtle change, but over time, it’s made a noticeable difference in my ability to stay focused.

Then there’s the **Noise Level Monitoring** script. My apartment building can get noisy, and it’s hard to concentrate when there’s a lot of background noise. The script monitors noise levels and sends me a notification when it gets too loud, so I can throw on some noise-cancelling headphones or move to a quieter spot. It’s a simple solution, but it’s helped me stay productive even in a less-than-ideal environment.

And, of course, I’ve already mentioned the **Automated Coffee Brewing** script. It’s a small thing, but it’s made my mornings feel a little smoother and more enjoyable. Plus, it’s just fun to show off to visitors—“Oh, don’t worry, the coffee will brew itself.”

# Learning and Skill Development: Automating My Growth

When I decided to learn Python, I wasn’t just looking for a new skill—I wanted to streamline how I learn and grow. That’s where the **Automated Study Schedules** script came in handy. I’m constantly juggling multiple learning goals, from improving my coding skills to keeping up with industry trends. With the script, I can break down larger subjects into bite-sized daily tasks and get reminders of what I need to focus on each day. It’s like having a personalized tutor who keeps me on track without being overbearing.

The **Resource Aggregator** script has also been a huge time-saver. I used to spend hours browsing different websites, bookmarking articles, and trying to keep up with the latest trends in tech and business. Now, I’ve set up the script to pull in relevant articles from my favorite sources and organize them in one place. Instead of wasting time searching for information, I can spend more time actually learning and applying what I’ve read.

Finally, the **Code Challenges Automation** script has been great for keeping my programming skills sharp. Every day, it serves up a different coding problem for me to tackle. Some days, it’s something simple, like reversing a string, and other days, it’s a bit more complex, like building a small algorithm. The variety keeps things interesting, and the daily practice is helping me improve my problem-solving skills over time.

# Miscellaneous Utilities: The Hidden Gems of Automation

Not every automation script fits neatly into a category, but that doesn’t make them any less valuable. In fact, some of the most useful scripts I’ve written are the ones that solve little, everyday problems.

For example, the **Weather Notifications** script has become a daily part of my routine. I used to check the weather app first thing in the morning, but now I get an automated message with the day’s forecast as soon as I wake up. It’s a small convenience, but it’s one less thing I need to think about during the morning rush.

Similarly, the **Social Media Post Scheduler** script has been a game-changer for managing my online presence. I run a couple of social media accounts, and I used to spend way too much time manually scheduling posts. Now, I just input the content and the time I want it posted, and the script takes care of the rest. It’s helped me maintain a consistent presence without feeling overwhelmed by the scheduling process.

Finally, the **Personalized News Aggregator** script has been an amazing tool for staying informed without information overload. I’m interested in a lot of different topics—technology, finance, productivity hacks—but it’s easy to get lost in the flood of news. The script curates articles based on my stated interests and sends me a daily digest of the top stories. It’s like having my own personal news assistant who only brings me the information I care about most.

# Closing Thoughts

Automation isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a game-changer. Whether you’re looking to save time, reduce repetitive tasks, or simply make your life a little easier, Python has a script for that. From managing your files to tracking your finances, from boosting your productivity to optimizing your home office, automation can help you work smarter, not harder.

These 51 Python scripts are just the beginning. Once you start automating, you’ll find that there are endless possibilities for streamlining your daily tasks. And the best part? You don’t need to be a professional programmer to make it work. Many of these scripts can be customized with just a few lines of code, and once they’re set up, they’ll run in the background, quietly improving your life without any extra effort on your part.

So, what are you waiting for? Start small—maybe with a simple task like organizing your desktop or automating your email filtering. Once you see the power of automation in action, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. And who knows? You might even get inspired to write your own scripts and take automation to the next level.

In the end, it all comes down to this: automation frees you up to focus on the things that really matter. Whether that’s growing your business, learning a new skill, or just spending more time doing what you love, Python can help you get there. So go ahead—embrace automation, and let Python handle the rest.

~Attempted to write my very first fanfic ever, to help me cope with DATV seemingly keeping a lot of what happens between Rook and Lucanis “off camera”. Please excuse grammar/punctuation errors; I’m very much an amateur.

This takes place right after the infamous “almost kiss” scene. FemRook, human Gray Warden - but kept descriptions out so you could picture your FemRooks when reading~




	*Well, shit*, Rook thought as she collapsed on her couch. It seemed they were finally getting somewhere..the flirting felt right, he was reciprocating and actually showing he was interested in her..then as if a switch was flipped, he just walked away. She had felt a spark when her finger touched his chest and her heart was beating so fast as he started to lean in that she was afraid he could hear it. How can there be so much chemistry and built up tension in one moment and nothing the next?

	She knew he’d obviously gone through a lot - he’d been imprisoned and tortured for a year and had an actual inner demon, for Maker’s sake.. but she saw how he interacted with others on the team and it seemed like he was able to be his usual charming self with them. She had to admit, if only to herself, that seeing him with Neve, especially, stirred up some jealousy. Rook was supposed to be leading the team, so maybe that meant she shouldn’t get involved with anyone? She’d have to ask Varric how the Inquisitor handled that burden. 

	She honestly hadn’t planned on falling for him so quickly. Romance had been the last thing on her mind. Her first impression of Lucanis Dellamorte was that he was not only incredibly good looking but also kind and well-dressed.. And that accent.. she’d met Antivans before but his accent seemed warmer, like something she could wrap around her. Ever since their coffee outing with Illario she couldn’t stop thinking about their flirty interaction that night and was dying to find out if their first kiss would taste like honey and lavender cream. But apparently she wouldn’t find out tonight.


	Lucanis leaned against the railing overlooking the emptiness of the Fade. He liked it here; it felt familiar in a way and was quiet enough that he could still hear himself think - when Spite let him of course. The demon had been getting increasingly harder to control lately. It had gotten to the point where Lucanis barely slept for fear that Spite would take over and escape, or worse. 
	
	He didn’t fully know the extent of what Zara’s experiment had done. And now that she was dead, he’d likely never find out. How long could Spite control his body at a time? Could he fully take over and cause Lucanis to cease existing? Would Spite still retain access to his skills…could he hurt people without Lucanis knowing? That last thought was the most concerning, especially now that he was beginning to care for someone in a way he previously hadn’t thought possible. Up until now his life had just been all about death and everything else had been filed away in some far off corner of his brain. There was no place for emotion in killing so he had learned to tune it out. Now he needed to figure out how to regain control of his emotions *and* not let Spite take over. 
	
	“*I want out!*” Spite growled, as if on cue.
	“I want you out too,” Lucanis answered.
	“*Tell her!*”
	“That would only complicate things further,” he looked over at Spite. This had been a lot to deal with, especially for a person who preferred solitude. He tried not to dwell on the horrors of that long year in the Ossuary but Spite was a constant reminder. How was he supposed to get back to normal with - *this*? Was there any getting back to normal? That seemed unlikely; he was an abomination now which was decidedly not normal. He couldn’t just act on his emotions, not with Spite lurking, always waiting for an opportunity to take control. He wouldn’t be able to forgive himself if someone innocent - if she - got hurt. 
	
	No matter how much he wanted to reach out and pull her close, he needed to keep his distance. It had taken every bit of self-restraint he had to excuse himself and walk away before he unleashed something he wasn’t sure he could control. The disappointment was written all over her face but it was for the best. She deserved better. 
	“*I like her.*”
	“You need to stay away from her,” Lucanis snapped and started heading back down the stairs and towards the pantry.


	Rook groaned; that was enough moping. She left her room to grab some wine from the kitchen. 
	
	She had just finished pouring when she heard the pantry door open and footsteps behind her. She thought he was still off clearing his head somewhere but apparently she’d moped in her room longer than she thought. She turned around and smiled shyly, “I was just leaving.” He looked worn out but her heart still leapt at the sight of him. She pushed that feeling down and started walking towards the door. 
	
	“Please..stay..” he said and gestured towards the table. 
	
	She slowly walked back over and sat down in her usual seat at the head of the table. She watched him as he started to make a fresh pot of coffee. They hadn’t been here in the Lighthouse for that long, but he seemed right at home in the kitchenette. There was a serene calm that settled over his face when he was cooking or making coffee, as if, for a moment, all his worries melted away. His hands moved with precision as he ground the coffee beans and her thoughts drifted to what else he could do with those hands. Kill, obviously; she’d seen him in action - master assassin was accurate. But also, there was a tenderness there - 

	“Rook? Are you alright?” She nearly jumped. 
	Blushing, she said, “Yes, just lost in thought.” 
	“Seems like it was a good thought,” he smirked and sat down next to her. 
	“Has Spite left you alone, since..”
	“Yes, he’s under control. Just need to stay awake,” he raised his coffee cup and the familiar aroma drifted toward her. She smiled at the thought that came to her, of Spite describing Lucanis’s scent. Smells like coffee and..rain, maybe, since he was always sharpening his knives and the whetstone seemed to give off that scent.    
	
	They sipped their drinks quietly for a while, listening to the fire crackling. Rook wondered what she could say to make him trust her enough to let her help. Not that she knew how to help, yet, but she was determined to find a way. She believed he was worth the effort, even if he didn’t. 
	
	“Rook, listen, I..I’m sorry about before,” he looked over to see her contemplating her wine. “This.. you..” he trailed off. “I’ve told you my life hasn’t really been my own. All I know is the job. There hasn’t been much room for.. anything else.”
	She looked up. “Yeah, I can understand that. And you’ve been through a lot in the past year, barely had time to recover, then Zara.. and we still have the gods to worry about..”
	“I need to work; focusing on the job helps, but I can’t fail again.. I can’t afford to be distracted again. You are a beautiful distraction, but a distraction all the same.”
	“If you need me to stay away from you-”
	“No, I need..” he interrupted, seemingly wrestling with what to say, “can we take this slow?”
	“Of course, anything you need, I’m here for you. Just..”
	“No hard feelings if you’ve changed your mind.”
	“I haven’t,” she hesitated, “I was just wondering why it seems like you’re more yourself around the rest of the team, around Neve.”
	“Ah,” he shrugged, “It’s been ingrained in me since I was a boy to keep up a façade around everyone. It comes naturally. But it’s different with you. Around you I feel like I can let down my guard..and that’s not a good thing in my line of work. Also, you’re in charge, so I need to be on my best behavior.”
	“I won’t hold a little bit of bad behavior against you.”
	He reached over, softly touched her face and gazed into her eyes. “I’ll keep that in mind,” he said.
	Rook pressed his hand closer to her cheek for a brief moment and felt a tingle. “Take all the time you need. And whenever you’re ready to talk about Spite or anything else, you know where to find me.”
	He got up to clean his now empty coffee cup then started strolling back over to the pantry. “Thank you for this. It was nice to just talk. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
	“Good night, Lucanis.”

	She sat there alone for a little while longer; she couldn’t trust her knees to not give out until she processed what just happened. It was probably the best outcome she could have hoped for given the circumstances. He was interested, just cautious; nothing wrong with that. She eventually got up, cleaned her cup and headed back to her room. *Focus*, she told herself, *you need to prepare to face the gods and stop acting like a character from one of Bellara’s serials..* 
	*But he called me beautiful*, she thought, and the tingle came back.",8,1731876652.0,Lucanismancers,6,1.0,False

Undergrave is super cool. It's a coffee break roguelike where you play small levels one at a time and you have three main abilities--you can throw your sword, jump, and dash. Jumping and dashing are considerably cheaper to use if you're not holding your sword. Attacking is a free action for both you and enemies--enemies can use it after they move and you can use it before you move. I had a situation yesterday where I jumped in the middle of three enemies (one was on my left, one on my right, and one below me); jumping next to an enemy pushes them back and stuns them, but all three of these guys had an object next to them so they just got stunned and remained next to me, so I got to kill all three of them for free without costing a turn.

I also played Seek Etyliv. Cool little puzzle roguelike, very simple. I think I beat it but it also seems like there's more to unlock (more characters, maybe more levels).

Edit: not something I played recently but I never see it talked about here--Cellar is a really good game. Doesn't really have replay value, but it's a really good game about a guy's struggle with addiction.",3,1731876622.0,roguelikes,0,1.0,False

1gtn8uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1gtn8uc/one_of_the_best_trips_i_ever_took/,One of the best trips I ever took.,"I've been fortunate to visit some interesting and faraway places. But one of the best trips I ever took was about 25 minutes from the house where I grew up.

I'm originally from a small town in Western New York, which means that I lived very close to Niagara Falls.

For many generations, U.S. citizens have been crossing over to the Canadian side of the Falls to have fun at the various tourist attractions there. This happened more frequently before 9/11, when border crossings were a breeze.

In my early 20s, when I was still in college, three friends and I decided to take a weekend trip to Niagara Falls--in the middle of February.

For those who don't know the area, Niagara Falls tends to get bitter cold at that time of year. Most of the tourist activity slows down, and the place becomes eerily quiet. This meant that the four of us got a very cheap deal on a luxurious hotel room.

One guy in our group made the rounds picking everyone up from work on Friday, so we were all packed and ready to go.

Because we viewed this trip as a fun and luxurious experience, we all decided to wear nice suits and ties. On the drive to the hotel, we played the song ""Puttin' on the Ritz.""

For dinner, we made reservations at a nice Italian restaurant. Then we went for a long walk along the main drag, in the blistering cold and wind.

Two of us wanted to visit a wax museum. The place was open, but there was no one at the front desk. So those guys just walked right in and went through the whole place, free of charge. Then we found this huge video game arcade/ billiard hall that was open 24/7. So we played billiards and air hockey and Pacman.

After sundown, we wanted to check out the nearby casino. But the weird thing was that we couldn't figure out how to get to the entrance. The whole building seemed to be encircled by steep cliffs and forest. So we tried trekking through the woods in the dark, in our wet, cold suits, searching for a way in. We never found it.

Back at the hotel, we went for a swim in the indoor pool, then sat around in the steam room.

In our room, we played some ridiculous game with a nerf dart gun, prank called some of our other friends, and watched grunge music videos on cable TV.

Early in the morning, we woke up startled to the sound of the phone ringing. Turned out the caller had the wrong room. Then we looked outside and realized that a massive snowstorm had hit and quietly covered everything while we slept.

Two of us went back to bed, but my other friend and I couldn't get back to sleep. We went downstairs for a hot breakfast and coffee, then went out to clean off the car.

We took a short drive to a nearby thrift store where we found some amazing vintage suits from the 1940s. They fit us perfectly, and we bought them both. Mine was green and my friend's was purple.

Then we drove back to New York and dropped everyone off at home.

Yeah, this very well may be a ""pointless"" story without a grand conclusion. Nothing unbelievable or spiritual or life-changing happened on that trip. But not a day goes by when I don't think about it.

I'm now in my mid-30's, divorced, living very far from my hometown, and all alone. I've tried meeting new people and making new friends, and it just never seems to work out.

One of those guys from my story is no longer alive. One got married and had a child and moved away. I don't know about the fourth. I've tried looking online and I can't find anything.

I don't like spending my weekends in solitude. I don't like spending so much time in front of a computer screen. I don't like how expensive most things have gotten, and how strangely many people seem to behave these days.

I would love to experience that weekend just one more time. With no computers, no smartphones, no constant talk of troubling events.

I want to dine with friends and play games and go for walks together, and see interesting sights and tell stupid jokes and go for a swim.

I wonder if I'll ever have that again.

1gtn5hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1gtn5hl/taurine_greenblack_teacaffeine/,Taurine/ green/black tea/caffeine ,"Hello, I’m new here and newly diagnosed. I was recently diagnosed with HH and an ulcer. My dr put me on pantoprazole40 mg 2x/day. 

I have to preface this by telling you all that I have epilepsy and my meds make me extremely fatigued. I am a stay at home mom to 2 kids, one with  chronic health issues so I need to be able to function and be alert all day (and some nights)for my son especially. I have a healthy diet, I don’t drink alcohol, coffee or smoke at all. 

I drink black and green tea for the caffeine to have energy and occasionally an Herbalife tea. I drink about 80-100 mg of caffeine 4-5 days a week. I forgot to ask the dr about the Herbalife teas (as I know they contain taurine) but when I asked if I could still drink tea for the caffeine she said I should be fine doing that and that one “vice” shouldn’t effect anything. 

I’m curious to know if any of you drink caffeine still. I’ve only been diagnosed for 4 days and been on meds for 2. The pain and pressure has actually gotten worse since starting the pantoprazole but she said to give it time so I’ll do that. I don’t need another symptomatic chronic health issue to add to my list (although I know a hernia isn’t curable which scares me so much) God bless all of you for dealing with this by the way, I’m so sorry. 

From the research I’ve done on this topic, I’m getting mixed info especially on taurine? I figured I’d have to cut out caffeine all together but my dr saying that gave me a little hope for that but again, confusing as I wanna treat this and get back to normal life asap. If I don’t have caffeine though, I’m honestly not sure that I can carry out my daily tasks on days my husband isn’t home. So what are your thoughts and opinions on this? I’d be so appreciative of any responses. So far I have not had any caffeine while on the med

1gtn484,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1gtn484/dignitaries_aa_meeting_nightmare/,Dignitaries AA meeting nightmare,"I have been sober for 10 years, it will be 11 years on Feb 14th 2025. I think AA is a great tool & fellowship for people who want/need to stop. I have been to many good AA meetings, but I want to talk about Dignitaries AA meetings. I was staying at a sober living halfway house the first time I went to a dignitaries meeting, my roommates in the house told me to go without warning me about it at all, they didnt tell me that it was basically a circle jerk for angry arrogant sober people who still act like drunks.

I am a recovering heroin addict, & at the time I went to my first dignitaries meeting I had never had a problem with alcohol, I always hated the taste & would get red in the face & violently ill when I drank, leading me to realize I was alcohol intolerant. Anyways, it gets to my turn to talk at this dignitaries meeting. I introduced myself as an addict, not knowing what was about to happen. Several of them instantly rudely interrupted me, yelling at me that I just came there to cause trouble. I asked why. They said that its a rule that everyone there is an alcoholic & should introduce themselves as such, & then they accused me of knowing that & that I just wanted to cause trouble. I told them I didn't know that rule, that my roommates told me to go & didnt warn me about anything. They explained some arrogant BS reason why you have to call yourself an alcoholic there, even if youve never had a drink in your life. I apologized but also defended myself by asking questions. I asked ""so if Im a recovering heroin addict who only tried drinking once or twice, Im still an alcoholic?"" And they said yes & several of them continued to yell at me. Then I mentioned that alcohol is just another drug that people get addicted to, so wouldnt it make sense for all of us to call ourselves addicts? They got even more upset & a couple of them started screaming & cursing me out, saying I was wasting their time. Then I said how their logic was hurting people by continuing to push the American idea that alcohol isnt a drug & society accepts its responsible use, which in turn was supporting the alcohol companies they claimed they hated. Then they screamed at me more. I told them that their logic was like having a meeting where they force everyone to say they are a ""heroinaholic"" or a heroin addict when most of them arent. Then they screamed more. Then I told them that alcohol a drug you get addicted to, its not seperate from other drugs, its all addiction, so if they are going to be bullies about what you call yourself then they should be logical & use the term ""addict"" instead. They got even more mad, & at this point I started getting upset myself. I told them that they are keeping people from getting the help they need by getting so caught up on their extremely illogical rule. I asked one of the guys yelling at me over & over if he'd call himself a heroin addict until he answered, & he said ""no I wouldnt"", so I said ""there you go, thats why I wont call myself an alcoholic, cuz Im not one, so if we need to be uniform like a catholic school then why dont we use our brains & come up with a new term that describes everyone? Oh wait, one already exists! The word addict! Ok, so we figured it out!"" And they did not find my cheekiness charming. I told them how uncomfortable their nonsense makes others, & that they are hurting the recovery community by being so strict & illogical & unaccepting. I told them that they waste their time on their arrogant nonsensical rules when they could be welcoming & help people who are new in sobriety. Their faces kept turning red by how much they were screaming. I told them if they just let me call myself an addict then I wouldve been done talking 10 minutes ago & that they are wasting everyone's time by expecting their arrogant ego's to be inflated by universal conformity. So just because they are alcoholics I have to be one? Alcohol is a drug just like any other intoxicant. I asked them to google what ""alcoholic"" meant in webster's dictionary, but not one of them pulled out their phones cuz they knew I was right. They dont care about all the people who need their help that they scare off because they need that authority & their egos to inflate for them to stay sober, proving that the normies at dignitaries AA meetings are the weakest of all the people in AA. Dignitaries AA meetings are literally just a circle jerk where everyone validates eachothers BS so they feel powerful. Maybe they are compensating for ""something"" lol. Idk why nonsensically labeling yourself as an alcoholic means so much to them, maybe its because of the opioid crisis that made them realize that their addiction to alcohol is way easier to quit & recover from than opiates/opioids, so they want everyone to label themselves as alcoholics so they dont feel weak. They lost their jobs, houses, & wives to their drinking, so they dont want to feel weak compared to a heroin addict who has more sobriety than them. Im not trying to belittle anyone's problems, no matter what drug (including alcohol) someone has to quit, if its their addiction than it is harder than hell to accomplish & hats off to them for doing it. Its just a scientific fact that its easier for a human brain to recover from years of alcoholism than it is from years of shooting heroin. There arent maintenance drugs like methadone or suboxone for quitting alcohol for a reason, its because opiates/opioids cause much much more pain to quit & take much much longer to recover from, if recovery is even possible. Many people are on methadone/suboxone for life. If the same was true for alcohol, theyd have benzo clinics that prescribe benzos like xanax or klonopin to replace their addiction to alcohol, but those dont exist cuz they arent necessary. Ive been to rehab 7 times, the alcoholics greatly recover after 2-4 weeks of sobriety, while the opioid addicts are still in complete agony for months to years after they get out of rehab. Its not a competition, everyone is different & has different psychological issues to sort through which can make things much harder or easier, but the science is there, opioids are much harder to quit. So I think people who go to these strict dignitaries meetings to force people to only talk about alcohol have serious anger issues, control issues, & are obsessed with their authority over newcomers. It isnt healthy. Its not right. It makes no sense. They are all just circle-jerking eachothers egos cuz thats the only way they can feel good enough about themselves to stay sober. I have gone to meetings in many different states, & in every single one I met people who were so traumatized by these arrogant idiots that they were either turned off of AA altogether or even turned off of sobriety altogether. When I was at this dignitaries meeting I kept getting screamed at so I kept calmly explaining why their logic was wrong & how they are hurting newcomers who just want to learn how to be sober without being screamed at. I told them they probably waste so much time of so many meetings by being so irrationally strict. More & more people kept standing up & cussing me out & calling me names, they were quite mean spirited. I reminded them that I didnt know their rules before coming & that they were being very unfair & impatient. At this point I started telling them that they ruined AA for me & told them to think about how many people like me they ruined AA for, I told them they were hurting people in need of help & hurting society as a whole by screaming at newcomers & causing many people to give up on sobriety. At this point, I begged them to really think about what I said & that I was going to leave now. I stood up, & 2 guys grabbed me by the arms and dragged me out of that meeting faster than I could walk while cussing me out & calling me a ""dumb ass (insert offensive slur for homosexuals that starts with 'F' here)"", & then they threw me out of the door so intensely that I fell flat on my face, causing me scrapes & bruises. I shouldve called the police & charged them with assault, they deserved jailtime for hurting me & hurting society as a whole. I wish I wouldve gotten them arrested & then gone to visit them in jail to laugh in their faces. I know that sounds childish, but somehow thars still more mature than they were acting at their ""members only"" club. I promise I was calm & collected the whole time, & when it got out of hand I volunteered to leave, yet they still charged up to me like linebackers & physically threw me out the front door, my face & body skidded across the concrete as they laughed in my face. I dare you to go through what I did without wishing horrible things would happen to these hypocrites.

Another thing that pisses me off even at normal meetings is that they force you to admit youre an alcoholic/addict no matter what. I know I'm an addict, but I also know most people in the world arent addicts.They literally say ""we cant drink like normal people, we cant stop after we start"", which literally implies that there are normal people who drink normally without being an alcoholic, yet anyone who ends up court ordered to an AA meeting is bullied into admitting they are an alcoholic. They literally say ""you ended up here but you dont think youre an alcoholic? Psshh! Yeah right! Youre sitting in that chair arent you? You got arrested for drinking didnt you? Youre an alcoholic, so just listen & let the people with the most sobriety share"". And Im like ""so even if they rarely ever drink but make the mistake of driving home after they have a few drinks & get a DUI that makes them court ordered to be here, that automatically makes them an alcoholic? Yeah right!"". For example, my dad only drinks a couple times a month at most, he got a DUI once & they tried the same BS on him. He knows hes not an alcoholic, he rarely drinks ever, he only drinks socially & made a mistake by driving home one night. 

AA can be great & very helpful, but I find this judgemental mindset to be very messed up & it sabotages the ""safe space"" that AA is supposed to create, it sabotages the help they can offer people. If the court orders you to be there because you made a dumb mistake but you barely ever drink, then you are not an alcoholic. 

Another thing is that when I was coming off of methadone which was the only way I was able to quit heroin, they say ""dont you dare smoke weed or use any other substance to help you through the withdrawals or you will end up back at the dope house in 10 minutes!"" I have heard this so many times I cant even count. I smoked marijuana to help me through the insanely painful & long lasting methadone withdrawals that most of these people could never even imagine, & I didnt relapse once. Yet they have the arrogance to apply their experience to everyone else. Its easy for these people who only had to go through a couple weeks of withdrawal to say not to use other substances to help you get through it, they have NO IDEA what it was like for me to go through almost 4 years of intense opioid withdrawals while only getting 0-2 hours of sleep a night for years & years. I was hallucinating like a schizophrenic from the withdrawals + sleep deprivation for years. Im not telling addicts/alcoholics that its ok to smoke weed or use other substances, but Im saying that not everyone's recovery follows the same path. If it wasnt for marijuana I would still be on methadone, or maybe I wouldve given up & gone back to being a homeless heroin addict. I never wouldve gotten completely sober without the help from marijuana & kratom. 

All of you that are rolling their eyes right now, Im here to tell you that a small percentage of the ""AA Elders"" that you all look up to so much smoke weed. Weed is legal in my state, & when I was still smoking it Id see elders buying weed there once in awhile. Theyd either avoid me or ask me not to tell anyone, & I didnt tell cuz I respect their privacy & their path. Im not saying alcoholics/addicts should smoke weed, Im just saying that everyones path is different. Some people might end up back at the dopehouse if they smoke weed, but I sure didnt. 

Caffiene & nicotine are addictive, coffee has theobromine in it which releases dopamine, AA ppl are so tweaked out on coffee & nicotine. They say they stopped hurting themselves & their health by becoming ""sober"". But tobbacco is so much worse for your health than a lot of drugs. Opiates/opioids are relatively harmless to your body if you dont overdose, but after quitting them you will feel horrible for a long time. These AA ppl are just waiting for their doctor to tell them they have terminal cancer from smoking. If you took many sets of two people & had one smoke a pack of cigarettes a day & had one take oxycodone everyday, then overall the ones who smoked a pack of cigs everyday would on average die much sooner than the ones who took oxycodone everyday (unless they overdose). AA is a great tool & great fellowship that helps many people recover, but we could do so much better. If we cut out the BS & were much less judgemental, I believe many people who would normally be turned off of AA would be able to accept it & grow spiritually, leading to many more people being able to recover.",0,1731876117.0,alcoholicsanonymous,18,0.14,False

1gtmylg,https://i.redd.it/4pl7obslvi1e1.jpeg,Anyway to remove possible staining between teeth? ,"

Hi everyone, I brush with a manual toothbrush, use fluoride based toothpaste, floss, use water flosser, and use mouthwash twice a day. Use xylitol mints. I only drink coffee once a day for breakfast, rinse with water afterwards, and wait about 30 min to brush teeth after coffee. I don’t smoke and avoid acidic drinks including soda. I’ve only have had a cavity once in a my life as a kid (more than a decade ago) and had braces. I stopped using my retainer since they stopped fitting. In the future, I would like Invisalign especially for my crooked bottom teeth. I’m wondering if you could please provide me with advice to get rid of what I think is staining primarily stains in between my bottom teeth. I feel self conscious and feel like people are noticing my staining when I smile. I’ve tried using arm and hammer toothpaste but I still have staining. I get dental X-rays once a year and cleanings every 6 months. Advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you! 🙏 ",1,1731875691.0,askdentists,2,0.99,False

I went into DAV planning to romance Lucanis. I was pumped because he seemed perfect. Angsty, emotional, and protective—his character seems straight out of a romance novel. However, I am already in the midst of Act II and I can’t believe the indifference he shows my Rook. He couldn’t seem to care less about her! Davrin, in comparison, shows so much more interest. Plus, Assan is the cutest thing in the whole world?!?

I’ve been flip flopping between the two since Lucanis was my plan originally but Davrin vibes with my character better in the game. And reading the romance reviews I think I’m gonna jump ship! It’s a shame, I love Lucanis’ wings but I want romance damnit! He hasn’t said anything nice to me since we got coffee!

1gtmxa8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumCyberpunk/comments/1gtmxa8/orion/,Orion,"Hey, so I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this. Most of my friends refuse to play the game, and the few who do didn’t get as hooked as I did. I also don’t have an audience on YouTube, lol. But for any potential Cyberpunk developers browsing this Reddit, here are some things you could improve in the next game or just fans of the game. 

First, the online mode was scrapped due to the launch issues, but honestly, you need to make sure that your online experience stands out in some way, especially with GTA 6 around the corner.

Second, please make the world much more immersive. After exploring every corner of the game, I realized it feels hollow. As confusing as it may sound, there isn’t much to interact with in the city. The majority of the buildings are just empty; you can’t enter them. The NPCs (one of your biggest selling points, so I expected better) have poor AI. Even after the 2.0 update, there was only a slight improvement. They are a bit better, but there is still room for major enhancements.

You could also consider adding jobs in the game. As mundane as it sounds, being a taxi driver could be fun. The passengers’ stories and experiences could be interesting, with options for multiple-choice dialogue or even small talk. Other jobs could include working at a fast-food chain or coffee shop (likely in poorer areas, as these would probably be automated in the city center) or even joining the NCPD. The NCPD gigs were cool, but having more immersive experiences, like working side by side with the NCPD, would make those gigs much more engaging. You could increase the difficulty by rolling with MaxTac (I know it sounds crazy, lol) to intervene in gang rivalries. Another way to make the world more immersive is to let us impact the political landscape. I felt completely powerless during the Parlez missions, and the ending video message in the credit scene left me with so many questions, especially when he asked me to call him. Also, please let us eat and sit wherever we want and have animations for eating! I can’t stress this enough. When I go to a bar and buy a drink, I just press “use,” and it immediately applies the effect—such a bummer and pretty annoying.

Now, onto a more mature topic: It’s no secret that Night City is hyper-sexualized, with sex shops, 18+ ads, and prostitutes on the streets. But outside of missions, the only sexual interaction we get is with Joytoys and recently the hangouts. That’s fine, but there’s literally a strip club (where Judy works) where we can’t do anything. Let us pay for braindances or maybe offer the option for lap dances, leading to us going to either our place or theirs to end the night. I’m not a creep or anything, but why tease us with all this adult content on the streets and then allow us to buy and kill people with dildos, only to not follow through? 😭

Next, you really need to fix the cars. Before I rant, why couldn’t we buy a flying car?! We see them everywhere in the game. The car designs are great, but the handling and speed mechanics are terrible, especially for the Mustang-type cars. The handling while turning is bad, and the braking system makes no sense. You could be driving at 200 mph, but when you slow down or crash, it feels like you’re going less than 30 mph with no friction—nothing like real cars. What I’m trying to say is that the game lacks any real sense of speed.

Oh and give us a option for a happy ending pls?

I'll probably be back in a couple of months with more ways I think that would improve the next game.

Let me know what you'll want them to improve or add to make Orion a head to head gta 6 competitor lol",0,1731875598.0,LowSodiumCyberpunk,0,0.25,False

You have someone you love. I hope she makes you happy, you deserve that. With her in mind it didn't feel right dumping all of this this on you. What I really wanted to tell you were that I wished our (mostly my) timing would have been better. I wanted to tell you I miss you. After all these years I still miss you. How stupid is that, huh? I should have forgotten about us. We were never really a thing anyway. Is it crazy? Absolutely, I never claimed to be sane. Nonetheless, it is what it is. I want us to try.

I want to go on dates with you. Go to restaurants, cafés and pubs. I want us to share meals, coffees and pints. Stolen glances over the cups, smiles and conversations. Both the pleasant ones and the difficult ones. I want us to get to know the persons we have become and grow together. I want to know whether you still play the guitar and what music you listen to now. I want to know the books you are reading and which movies you like. I want us to share thoughts and feelings, joys and fears. I want you to trust me again and for you show me the depths of you affection. I want to show you I am worthy of your trust and I want to be vulnerable with you. I want to show you affection and I want you to be vulnerable with me.

Context: Worked a couple months at a grocery store coffee shop. I am MtF and was just starting to experiment with makeup at the time, mainly just eyeliner and some shadow. Also have sensory issues so was wearing earplugs that I can normally understand people through. 

I had a regular come in and order the same drink and would always try to be friendly. I would try to be friendly back to, I'm normally passable at conversation.

Then one day he came in. This was the first time he saw me wearing makeup, and it was a bit brighter than normal. I also had earplugs in and said something after his order that I didn't quite catch. I took an earplugs out and said, ""sorry?"" And he said, with a smile on his face, ""what, are you re---ded or something?"" 

It took me a second to realize what he said, so to cover i just kinda laughed it off and he left but wtf. I don't know if he guessed i was autistic cause of the earplugs, or if he thinks all trans people are mentally ill like that.

Next time he came in, I was opening alone and I got backed up so I was already in a bad mood, then he started to complain, I think in a joking manner, about the wait. So from then on I served him with a stone cold face.

On my last day of that job, he came in and told me, ""just so you know, I don't care, you can kiss whoever, dress up as whatever"" which to some of you reading might seem like a well meaning thing, and I don't really want to explain why it's annoying to hear, but it is.",7,1731875264.0,retailhell,1,0.74,False

I am soliciting your esteemed opinions and advice in advance of meeting up with the most wonderfully delightful woman of anyone’s imagination. We’re to meet up and share what will certainly be an all too brief sip of coffee before retiring to a car whereupon we will likely engage in what could only be described as an illicit encounter. And not for a session of torrid coitus in positions to make even the most practiced of yogi jealous, but to traverse the short distance from the coffee shop to a hotel secured for the weekend under the guise of a work trip. 

This affair is for neither of us our first, and we are realistic that it could end as fast as the blink of an eye while remaining hopeful it lasts much longer. Time is as fleeting as a flash in a pan, or an enduring spectacle for the ages. We know our time together will be somewhere in between. 

What started as light banter and the initial trivialities of verbally probing one another to ascertain some level of compatibility quickly became hours upon hours of communication that ran the gambit of modern media: written, spoken, and visual. Our conversations have delved each others psyches and gone into deep places best left hidden but from each other, and tripped the light fantastic with effervescent giggles and laughter. It’s not uncommon we finish each others thoughts and sentences. As of this writing, she’s called “jinx” on me no less than two dozen times and I owe her a veritable deluge of coffee in return. 

But it matters not a whit. 

So, a question for the crowd: how long was your first date? Was it a mere formality on the way to other activities, or was it an interview complete with background check and biometric scans?

To forestall any follow up questions, we’ve each had tests to confirm cleanliness and shared those results. We know each others “real” names and have verified within reason our identities to one another for each others safety. We each have cover stories for the time we’ll be together, and in the event of a “holy shit we got caught together” moment, we have a story for that too. ",1,1731875200.0,adultery,7,0.56,False

I am using the same amount of stabilizer as my other French styles from her book, but it just comes out so little.  Could it be an issue with using creme fraiche?  I even made sure to use a brand that does not have stabilizers.

Recipe

Cream (20%)

 200g | 1 cup

Milk (40%)

400g | 2 cups

Glucose syrup (5%)

 50g | ¼ cup

Sugar (15%)

 150g | ¾ cup

Egg yolks (10%)

 100g | about 5 large yolks

Coffee beans

 30g | ½ cup

Crème fraîche (10%)

 100g | ½ cup

Texture agent of your choice (see below )
Prepare an ice bath. Fill a large bowl two-thirds of the way with very icy ice water and place it in the refrigerator.

Boil the dairy and sugars. Put the cream, milk, glucose, and sugar in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, and place it over medium-high heat. Cook, whisking occasionally to discourage the milk from scorching, until the mixture comes to a full rolling boil, then remove the pot from heat.

Temper the yolks and cook the custard. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks. Add ½ cup of the hot dairy mixture to the yolks while whisking so the hot milk doesn’t scramble the yolks. Pour the tempered yolks back into the pot of hot milk while whisking. Place the pot over medium-low heat and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot constantly with a rubber spatula to avoid curdling.

Chill. When you notice the custard thickening, or the temperature reaches 180°F on a kitchen thermometer, immediately pour the custard into a shallow metal or glass bowl.   Nest the hot bowl into the ice bath, stirring occasionally until it cools down.

Strain. When the custard is cool to the touch (50°F or below), strain it through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any bits of egg yolk. (This step is optional, but will help ensure the smoothest ice cream possible.)

Infuse the coffee. Stir the coffee beans into the cooled custard, and transfer it to the refrigerator to infuse for 12 hours.

Strain the custard and add the crème fraîche. When you are ready to churn your custard, strain out the coffee beans through a fine-mesh sieve. Take ¼ cup of the cold custard and stir it into the crème fraîche until smooth, and then stir this back into the custard.

Churn. Place the base into the bowl of an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ice cream is ready when it thickens into the texture of soft-serve ice cream and holds its shape, typically 20 to 30 minutes.

Harden. To freeze your custard ice cream in the American hard-pack style, immediately transfer it to a container with an airtight lid. Press plastic wrap directly on the surface of the ice cream to prevent ice crystals from forming, cover, and store it in your freezer until it hardens completely, between 4 and 12 hours. Or, feel free to enjoy your ice cream immediately; the texture will be similar to soft-serve.

- cooked broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers in olive oil 

- ate black beans almost everyday (sometimes as a side dish to my chicken or flavored when mixed into a dish I made).

Content marketing isn’t what it used to be. The game has shifted, and AI tools like ChatGPT are right at the center of it all. If you’ve been in the marketing space for even a second, you’ve probably heard the buzz. But what does it really mean for how businesses plan their *marketing strategies*? Let’s dive into it and keep it real.

# Why AI Is the New Best Friend for Marketers

AI tools aren’t just fancy toys. They’re changing the way we do the hard stuff. Brainstorming ideas? AI’s got it. Writing posts, emails, or even ad copy? Done in minutes. Think of it like this: you’ve got a helper that never sleeps, never takes coffee breaks, and can handle multiple tasks without complaining.

ChatGPT, for instance, can whip up a blog draft faster than you can say “deadline stress.” But here’s the twist—AI doesn’t replace creativity. It gives it a boost. You still need to steer the ship. AI just helps it sail smoother.

# What This Means for Content Marketing Strategies

The biggest change? Speed and scalability. Brands can now push out content like never before. And not just random words thrown together. AI tools make it possible to tailor messages for specific audiences. Need a quirky tone for Gen Z or something formal for corporate clients? It’s all in the prompts.

But don’t get lazy. Marketing strategies still rely on connecting with real people. AI is a tool, not a magic wand. If your content feels robotic, people will bounce faster than you can blink.

# Here’s how AI can shake things up:

* **Content Creation**: Blogs, captions, product descriptions—all done in a snap.
* **SEO Optimization**: AI knows the keywords, baby. It keeps your content searchable.
* **Personalization**: Emails that feel like they were written just for you? AI’s secret sauce.
* **Data Analysis**: Numbers don’t lie. AI crunches data and tells you what works and what doesn’t.

# The Human Touch Matters

AI can do a lot, but it can’t feel. People connect with stories, not just stats. Sure, ChatGPT can draft a killer intro, but the heart of your message needs to come from you. A balance between tech and humanity is the sweet spot.

And let’s talk mistakes. AI doesn’t get context right every time. It can mess up cultural nuances or use a word that doesn’t quite fit. That’s where you come in. Proofread, tweak, and make it yours.

# Future-Proof Your Marketing Strategies

As AI keeps evolving, marketers need to stay sharp. Learning how to work with tools like ChatGPT isn’t optional—it’s essential. But here’s the thing. Don’t rely too much. Keep your creative muscles flexed and your strategies adaptable.

To wrap it up, AI tools are transforming the marketing world. They’re fast, smart, and powerful, but they’re just tools. Use them wisely, and your content marketing strategies will go from good to legendary.

I'm not looking for medical opinions on coffee, but let's start with the assumption that it might be worth a try. My wife has deconstructed a lot but still is firm on the ""word of wisdom."" If a doctor or NP prescribed coffee, I think she would try it. (She takes cannabis as prescribed, within current TSCC policy.) 

So, my question is this. Are any of you familiar with TBM doctors or NPs who would prescribe coffee if it was in the best interest of the patient (whom they think is also TBM, or not)?

But would really appreciate seeing some people talk about dealing with intense stress and managing their health.

So I've been pretty disappointed in myself for the way things have been going, and wondering how people deal with the anxieties that come from cutting down on unhealthy things that have been used as a crutch for stress.

I, 25F am currently writing up my thesis and praying I get it done before the end of this year. So while I can't jump into a full health revolution at the moment, I am trying to regain some control as I am putting weight on fast, its harder for me to breath and I have an old heart condition (non-active) that I would like to not mess with.

Coffee, Food and Alcohol are my very toxic friends. Admittedly coffee doesn't actually do much for me, except help me control the other two components. I find when I am not drinking (alcohol) regularly, I have insane desire to eat all the time. And when I try to portion control and cut alcohol at the same time, I can't concentrate, I am super anxious and my body just sits in panic mode which is pretty exhausting and I really want to get this thesis done so I can move on with my life.

Now I am proud to say that I tend to eat healthy. Could be better but it's not too bad. Occasionally I have the slip up when I binge on chips or cookies, but I try and fill myself with salads and healthy fats. But it's not hunger that drives me to eat.

The alcohol is purely because when I am relaxing, I can't seem to relax. I used to do yoga and mindfulness but my brain is so crowded its hard to dampen the noise - if that makes sense.

I'm off to physio today which will help my back, shoulders and neck. They tend to cramp up over time without the additional stress. So hoping this evening I'll be able to return to some peaceful stretching.

I just feel like such a yoyo. I had a big party this weekend, I now I'm all motivated to cut out the booze and control my eating. But I know if I somehow make it to tomorrow, the day after is going to be stress eating and a clouded brain. It affect my work, my confidence is almost gone, and with the festive holidays around the corner, I don't want to look like such a disappointment when everyone else in the family has the lives together.",3,1731874643.0,loseit,2,1.0,False

1gtmjkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gtmjkb/how_to_address_more_than_shitty_roommate/,how to address more than shitty roommate?,"I apologize if this is long but there’s a lot of important context that I need to share before I get to the problem I’m having. I appreciate any and all responses and all viewpoints. I am concerned for my safety and for my husband's safety at this point. I (24NB) live with my husband (33M) and my roommates, Michael (32M) and Connor (33M). I moved into the house a couple of years ago but my husband has owned it for about a decade. We had three roommates, Michael being one of them. Since then, the others have moved out and Connor has moved in.

When I first moved in, Michael was the perfect roommate. He was fairly tidy and cleaned up after himself. He was the only roommate who also helped with chores around the house. He also often bought things for the house like coffee or toilet paper. He was nice but also stayed out of our way and never really bothered me. We would have a conversation here and there but there were no red flags. The three of us shared food and were okay with it. I figured out over time that Michael had lived here for a good majority of the time my husband owned the house. He had lived here as soon as my husband bought the house, then left to live with his wife. They ended up not lasting very long, so after he got divorced, he moved back in. He has made it clear that he doesn’t plan on moving out unless we kick him out.

Michael worked at a gas station when I first moved in. After about a year of me being here, he got a job offer that he took. He quit his job on the spot. The job offer ended up not being legit and they ghosted him. I don’t know much about the offer, only that it was a crazy amount of pay and I can only assume it was a scam. Michael tried going back to his old job but they wouldn’t allow him back since he quit without warning. He was without a job for a few months. He got a new job that he worked for two weeks. The company ended up firing him out of the blue. He told us that they had fired him and most of his other coworkers due to a financial error. Another few months passed and he got another job. He worked only a few days and his boss ghosted him. When I had asked questions about it, he told me that he had spent all day calling and texting his boss and then “deleted everything”, meaning he had deleted their texts and stuff and gave up trying. His boss never made him fill out paperwork so he couldn’t even file for unemployment. Another few months passed and he got another job at Walmart. It was part time but it was better than nothing so we didn’t complain. He also worked about two weeks and got fired. It was a similar reason as to when he got fired before, that he was let go along with a lot of his coworkers. I wasn’t suspicious with this all at first but over time, there seems to be a lot of weird comments or decisions he’s made. During this time, my husband offered to get him a job where my husband works and he agreed, but then he stood up the manager he was supposed to have a meeting with because he had found another job hiring that he applied to, but then never got. It was these kinds of stupid mistakes that he was making that frustrates me.

It’s been over a year since he originally quit the gas station job. He has not paid much of anything towards rent. At first, we were okay paying for things like his food and things because it seemed like he was really trying to find another job. My husband and I often make dinner together and we frequently would offer him some. Even if we ordered food, my husband would automatically get Michael some. I eventually got tired of feeding Michael because we were struggling financially. I asked my husband to slow down offering food to him because I think he’s relying on it instead of finding a job. He’s not scared of running out of food because we buy food for us that he eats. We made a large batch of chili a month ago and he ate all of the leftovers in a single sitting the day after we made it. I’m not going to lie, that was really frustrating. I was really looking forward to eating the leftover chili. He also has barely helped with buying things for the house. He keeps telling me that I can have any of his food that I want and it feels like he’s pressuring me so he can make sure I know what a “good” guy he is. This is the main reason he thinks he’s a good roommate, because he’s always willing to “share” food and he “buys” us stuff. In the time that he’s not worked, he’s bought very very small amounts for the house, if anything at all. This wouldn’t bother me as much but he pretends like he buys a lot and that we owe him. He also bought new $700 boots during this time.

During the down time, Michael also became obsessive with me. I can’t really say if it was me in particular or if he just wanted entertainment but it was obsessive nonetheless. Michael spent most of his day playing games on his computer, but if I ever made a noise then he would be right next to me, just… there. If I was cleaning or cooking, he’d be right there. It wasn’t like he was checking in on me or anything, he would stand there and pretend to do something unless I made conversation. For example, there was once I was making a sandwich and closed the pantry door just loud enough so he could hear it. Next thing I know, he’s standing behind me, staring at me. I gave it a few minutes to see if he would walk away but instead he stayed, so I walked away instead. He instantly left the kitchen and went back into his room once I had left. He also had a habit of going to the front door and staring at me or my computer. I have my computer in the living room and I can see the reflection of the door in our TV when it’s off. I have even stopped what I’m doing and just left it at a random page to see if he would get bored but he still stares. It’s not even interesting stuff either, usually it’s just twitter or something. At this point, he's basically like a dog. Following me everywhere, just staring. This made me incredibly uncomfortable but I could never address it because it was always disguised as him wanting coffee in the kitchen or putting his shoes on at the door. I started getting anxiety attacks whenever he came around and it became a big issue. It has really only recently stopped but that was when he got a girlfriend so…

Connor moved in two months ago, which meant Michael had to move his computer from the basement to upstairs in the guest room, which I now call the computer room. This has caused even more issues because Michael seemingly can’t sit still. He is constantly going outside to smoke a cig or weed. It is several times an hour, every single day. Any of my actions revolve around avoiding him and it’s making me even more anxious. I feel like I can’t even breathe. Adding on to the obsessive behaviors, I have caught Michael listening in to when my husband and I are in our room fighting or having sex. I’ve come out several times to see Michael just standing in the hallway or just inside the living room. He has a really bad reaction time because he’s always just standing there until I open the door. We used to be in the guest room, which is right next to Michael’s room, when I moved in but we moved to the master bedroom since our roommate moved out. It weirds me out to think he was probably listening the whole time. I honestly just want some private time with my husband but I can never get that. Michael is constantly in the way or hanging around.

The roommates we have are on official contracts to live here that are made and enforced by my FIL. This means we can’t just kick him out, it’s up to my FIL. Well, my FIL sent Michael a notice at the beginning of this month, saying he either needs to find a job or move out. We have two weeks until the end of the month and Michael still hasn’t found a job. I asked him where he planned on moving if it didn’t work out and he said “I don’t plan on moving”. His mom lives nearby in town so I asked if he could live there and he said no. He also said the same when I asked about his girlfriend. Michael believes that if he can get on unemployment, then he can stay. He also believes that my FIL’s notice was unofficial so he's not taking it seriously. He has not prepared to move at all. No packing or anything either.

I’ve asked my husband to talk to my FIL and bring up my concerns but he keeps brushing it off. He doesn’t like conflict and, even more so, doesn’t like talking to his parents so I’m just getting more frustrated and more anxious.

I’m honestly really scared that Michael isn’t taking this seriously and doesn’t think we’re going to kick him out. I don’t know how to get him to face the truth. I think he’s overall a nice guy but he’s had his moments and I think he needs a huge wakeup call at this point. I’m afraid that it’ll get ugly when it comes down to it. He seems to be building up this anger and hatred for the world, blaming it instead of taking accountability. He won’t ever admit that he’s the problem. I feel like it's all going to blow up. I don’t know what to do or how to keep us safe.",1,1731874580.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I've been getting into the ""Lit RPG"" subgenre of fantasy novels and it has been a lot of coffee-and-cookies (my version of beer and pretzels) fun for me. I thought, ""what if I could simulate a LitRPG novel with the FATE system?"" So I put together a one-shot called ""Aeternia Rising."" In it, the PCs play a human who is descending into a full-sensory-experience neuro-tapped VR experience where they take on a fantasy character. The story works on both the every day life level and on the fantasy level. The FATE system is great for this because it can handle the trope in the LitRPG genre of ""Wow, I'm coming up with something brand new that the fantasy world designers didn't expect and now I can do cool stuff because I am a cool special game player!""   
There's that communication between the ""this is a game"" level and the ""there is a story in there"" level.

In addition to the Concept aspect and trouble aspect each character has a Motive Aspect describing why they play Aeternia, a RL Aspect deciding what they have going on in RL that might help or hurt them, and a Item Aspect representing a cool magic item or weapon that defines their character.

In addition to this, there is an Adulting skill which dictates how well the player character is doing iRL and whether or not that could hurt their gameplay.

","I am once again on the lookout for a close friend who I can hang with every now and again!

I'll jot down my hobbies here and if they resonate/match with yours feel free to drop me a DM! :))

I will say though, that I am pretty high energy & no filter so if you're not okay with that -- probably best to stay away!

Anyway, here goes, I like:

Music, Dance/Fitness, Skincare/Fashion, Video Games (currently playing a fair bit of BO6 zombies if you're into that!!), Language Learning, Cooking/Baking, Coffee/Drinks!

I do have other hobbies but I'd say the above are probably all my main ones :) I will say though, I am from the UK but my sleep schedule can be pretty scuffed so I'm happy to chat to people from anywhere in the world :)

1gtme9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1gtme9q/day_20_getting_real_strong_urges_today/,day 20 getting real strong urges today,Been doing very good with abstaining and have kind of had a flatline which has helped me with my nofap. The past 2 nights I’ve gotten very bad sleep and that is one of my biggest triggers. That alongside having free time and being caffeinated (i stopped drinking coffee but I did today because I had a 9 hour). It’s been busy at my job all day and lots of hot curvy women have came through in these little skimpy outfits. Maybe it’s stress from work or maybe I’m just being super lustful and want to pleasure myself but I started this to delay gratification and become more happy with completing meaningful goals that move me forward in life. Don’t dm me cuz I’m not responding Ik there’s some of you in here who are trying to ruin people’s streaks cuz you’re miserable with your lives.,1,1731874192.0,NoFap,2,1.0,False
