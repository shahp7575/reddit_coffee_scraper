1ka7zx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ka7zx5/df83v_vs_eureka_mignon_single_dose_pro_eu_based/,"DF83V vs Eureka Mignon single dose PRO [EU based, 600€]","Hey everyone,

as the title says, I’m considering buying one of these two grinders – **Eureka Mignon Oro Single Dose PRO** or **DF83V**. Right now, I have a Sage Dose Control Pro and a Dedica 885, but I’m planning to upgrade to a Silvia Pro X. Me and my girlfriend mainly drink **milk-based drinks** (cortados, cappuccinos, and flat whites), so the grinder will be used exclusively for **espresso**.

A bit more about my situation:

•	I enjoy **lighter to medium** roasted coffee.

•	We make about **4 cups** of coffee daily (2 per person).

•	Single dosing is preferable, so I change coffee often.

•	Counter space isn’t huge, but both grinders should fit fine.

•	I plan to stick with the Silvia Pro X for a couple of years, then possibly upgrade to a Lelit Bianca before eventually moving toward an endgame setup.

•	**Budget is around €600** and I don’t want to stretch it further (gf would kill me!). That said, I’m also open to other recommendations within this range.

After doing some research, the Mignon seems very well built and generally higher quality than other DF grinders (I’ve seen quite a few bad reviews of the DF64). The DF83V seems to have better build quality compared to older DF grinders based on the few reviews out there. I am also aware that there’s a burr size difference - 64mm vs. 83mm, but can’t decide whether to go for the “hand made quality” or the size of the burrs and other features. Another downside of the Mignon is that it doesn’t allow for SSP burr upgrades.

Both grinders are in the same price range – **Mignon PRO is 612€ and DF84V is 624€**.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation, choosing between these two? Or are there other grinders in this price range I should consider? Anything I am missing or should consider?

* Sit and read from a curated book collection
* Enjoy free filter coffee or tea
* Relax in comfy armchairs with soft lighting and peaceful music *(Books would stay on-site — no borrowing.)*

Hey  👋 So, I’ve been deep-diving into astrology lately (like rabbit-hole levels of deep 😅), and it’s actually blowing my mind how much more it is than just your daily horoscope or random zodiac memes. Sure, those “Which sign should you date based on your coffee order?” posts are fun ☕😂 but the real stuff?? It can seriously help you understand your *soul’s path* in this life 🌌

**✨ Get Your Psychic Reading NOW, Available 24/7! 🔮 Ready for answers? Don’t wait – check out the top post in this subreddit for instant insights and guidance. Your future is waiting! 🌟**

So what do I mean by “soul’s path”? Think of it like this: astrology isn’t just telling you who’s compatible with your sign or why you cry during Mercury retrograde 😭 It’s this ancient cosmic tool that can actually show you what you came into this life to *learn*, grow through, and become. Like why you’re drawn to certain people, why some things come easy to you, and why other stuff feels like pushing a boulder uphill every day 🪨💔

The wild part is, a lot of this info is right there in your **birth chart** – aka your soul’s cosmic blueprint. It’s basically a snapshot of the sky at the exact moment you were born 🪐 It shows where all the planets were, and each one represents different parts of you: emotions, thinking, love style, career drive, even your hidden fears 👀

But here’s the deep part that most people don’t talk about: there are certain points in your chart that speak directly to your *life purpose* and your spiritual evolution. Like your **North Node** and **South Node**. These two are lowkey the MVPs if you want to know what your soul is really here for 🔥

Your **South Node** is like your past-life comfort zone. It’s the energy you’ve mastered before, the stuff that feels familiar but might be holding you back now. Your **North Node**, on the other hand, is your soul’s “stretch zone” – it’s uncomfortable, but it’s where the real growth and purpose happen. When you start living in that North Node energy, things start to feel aligned. Not always easy, but definitely *right* 🙏💫

For example, my South Node is in Leo and my North Node is in Aquarius. So I’ve always felt comfortable being in the spotlight, doing creative stuff, needing recognition (guilty 😅). But life keeps nudging me toward group work, community, being part of something bigger than myself. It’s a struggle sometimes, but when I lean into it, I feel this weird peace, like “yes, this is it.” That’s the soul’s path kind of feeling. Not ego-level success, but soul-level fulfillment 🧘‍♀️

Another cool part? **Saturn** in your chart. A lot of people hate on Saturn because it’s the planet of tough love, structure, and discipline 😬 But astrologers call it the “teacher planet” for a reason. Wherever Saturn sits in your chart, that’s where you have a major life lesson to master. It might feel like a blocked area or something you have to work twice as hard at, but once you do the work, Saturn blesses you in big ways 💼⏳

And don’t even get me started on **Chiron**, the “wounded healer.” This asteroid shows your deepest wound – the kind of pain that sticks with you – but also where you have the power to help others through that same kind of pain. Like your trauma can become your superpower 💥 I know that sounds cheesy but it’s true. I’ve seen people turn their most painful experiences into healing for others once they understood their Chiron placement.

The whole chart is like that tbh. It’s not about putting you in a box or predicting exactly what’s gonna happen. It’s more like giving you a map of your soul, so you can actually understand why life feels the way it does sometimes. Why certain patterns keep repeating. Why you’re drawn to certain paths but afraid to walk them 👣

Once I started actually studying my chart instead of just reading Sun sign horoscopes, I saw myself in a completely different way. Stuff I used to beat myself up over suddenly made sense. Like, I have a lot of Pisces energy, so I’m super sensitive and intuitive, but I used to think I was just “too emotional.” Astrology helped me see that it’s not a flaw – it’s a strength when I channel it the right way 🌊💖

And real talk – it can be SO validating. Like if you’ve always felt “weird” or like you didn’t fit in, your birth chart can explain *why*. Not in a way that’s like “oh well, that’s just how I am,” but more like, “okay, now I get what I’m here to work on.” It’s empowering AF 💪✨

Also, the cool thing is you don’t need to be an expert or go super deep right away. There are tons of tools online where you can plug in your birth time and get a full chart (just make sure you know the exact time – it matters a lot!). Even just learning your Big Three – your **Sun, Moon, and Rising** signs – can unlock so much insight.

Your **Sun** is your core personality 🌞  
Your **Moon** is your inner world and emotions 🌙  
Your **Rising** (or Ascendant) is how you present yourself and what energy you’re growing into ⛰️

Those three alone can help you understand how you operate in relationships, what kind of environments you thrive in, how you deal with conflict, and what kind of self-care actually works for you 🛁✨

And when you layer that with stuff like the Nodes, Saturn, and Chiron… it’s like a whole soul blueprint. Not a set-in-stone destiny, but a guide. A vibe. A spiritual GPS that says “you might want to take this road instead” 🚗🌠

I honestly think everyone should learn their chart – not to get obsessed with it or use it as an excuse, but to understand yourself better and grow with awareness. Like yeah, some things are hard-coded, but there’s always room for free will and choices. Astrology doesn’t take away your power – it shows you where to *use* it 💥🧭

I could go on forever about this stuff lol but I’ll wrap it up here. If you’ve ever felt lost, stuck, or like you’re here for “something more” but can’t quite put your finger on it... seriously, look into your birth chart. You might be surprised what it shows you. It’s not magic, but it kinda feels like it 💫🌀

Have you ever looked at your chart and had that “ohhhhh, THAT’S why I’m like this” moment? Or found your North Node and suddenly everything clicked? I’d love to hear about your experiences! Drop your chart surprises, questions, or even your placements below 👇 Let’s chat astrology! 🪐❤️

So, I (22F, Black) have a friend (26F, White)—we’ll call her *Kay*. We’re in the same nursing program and have been basically inseparable for the past year: studying for every exam, grinding through finals, and surviving clinicals together.

Now here’s where it gets... weird.

We were at our usual coffee shop, prepping for an upcoming exam, when the topic of pulse oximeters came up. Kay casually drops this: *“Did you know that Black people can mess with the pulse ox readings?”* I said, *“Huh?”*—because what?

She then *doubles down* and goes, *“Yeah, if they’re dark dark, it won’t give an accurate reading.”* Then—get this—she *pauses*, looks at me, and adds, *“Even darker than you.”*

I was stunned. Our other friend sitting with us looked equally uncomfortable. I just said, *“That’s an odd thing to say... especially for someone who’s white,”* grabbed my stuff, and left.

Since then, I’ve ignored her texts and calls. I know there's some science behind skin tone and pulse ox accuracy, but it wasn’t *what* she said—it was *how* she said it. The tone, the pause, the delivery… it just felt off. Almost like a microaggression wrapped in a “fun fact.”

Now I’m sitting here wondering—AITAH for calling it out and cutting her off (at least for now)?

Oh hey! You got here fast! Work just got off for you like… 

\[checks the time\]

20 minutes ago. I am still tidying up, What’s the rush? You got here so fast.

…

Work is like 25 minutes away for you, Mr. Leadfoot. You really gotta cut that out. I swear you think getting points on your license is some sort of high score you’ve been working on. Didn't you get a speeding ticket just a month ago? On that note, what is the current score you've racked up on that license?

…

Yeah, yeah, quit your excuses. Here. \[sound of can opening\]

(In a joking, teasing tone and a fake English or ‘posh’ accent) Tis Freedom Friday for my cubicle hero, welcome to your respite, oh fine warrior. Your gift for fighting hard this oh-so-brutal work week is thine favorite, a crisp can of domestic beer. But fret not, as the copious board games, late-night movies, and snacks I have accrued are here for your pleasure my good sir, to wipe away thine stress and worry from such an arduous week.

…

Yet, alike the Trojan horse, my comfort is but a ploy! For the thrill of competition is the main thoroughfare for tonight. (End accent)

\[Speaker rustles through boxes of board games on the coffee table\]

On a real note, what game are you feeling tonight? I veto big setups like Gloomhaven because I think I am just as tired as you. Maybe a deck builder? Oh, oh, I’m feeling management sim, like… rising sun!

…

You really did get your ass handed to you last time but I’ll have you know, My pokerface is one of my greatest prides, so don’t feel too bad. It has been years in the making. (Smug) And that pride only grew when I saw how frustrated it made you.

…

If you aren't feeling a good throw-down, how about Forbidden Island then? Cooperative with only a BIT of frustration.

…

Then it's settled!… ALMOST!

\[Speaker pulls away the board game from the table\]

Sorry to say, but I seem to have forgotten something very important! (teasing tone) I’ve been so busy with work all day today, and haven’t eaten a thing and I am oh so hungry… 

Eh, eh, eh

\[nudges listener a few times\]

…

(pouting) Pleaseeeee cook for me? 

…

You know your cooking is better than all the places we could order in, and I may have kinda already bought all the ingredients… pleaseeeeeeee?

…

Fine then! I’ll go make it myself if you won't cook it for me.

…

My cooking wasn’t that bad! Listen, I only looked away from those veggies for just a second! I had to go check a message from work that came in. It looked urgent and I’ll have you know it was! As soon as I was done I walked back into the kitchen to see hellfire had invited itself to my stovetop. I still giggle at the face you made as you came screeching out of the bathroom. Even better was the horror on your face seeing me run at the stove with a big bowl of water while the alarm was blaring. 

…

Hahahahaha, It's what you get for stepping between my bowl of water and the fire. Clearly, you are no wicked witch since you didn't melt after getting splashed. I don't know why you are still so upset about it. And here I was, so convinced you were quite wicked with all the brutal Mario Party beatings you’ve handed me.

…

I can cook just fine, I’ll have you know, so just let me up already. 

\[sounds of speaker struggling to get up and wrestling listener while giggling\]

Let me gooooooooooo

\[listener grabs speaker’s wrist as she stands and pulls her back down, accidentally into their lap\]

…

\[listener grabs speaker, wrestles her back, and pulls her in close. The moving sounds slowly stop\]

(Serious tone) Thank you for that. Back then. Really. I was scared, panicking, and not sure what to do. You helped out and stopped me from making it worse. I… Really appreciate… you… for what you did. 

\[The sounds of the speaker’s voice get closer, as if leaning in\]

…

Okay jackass \*laugh\* I was trying my best, why do you have to say it like that? So are you going to cook us dinner or not?

…

YAY! Thank you. Can I help?

…

Yes Chef! 

\[The sounds of cooking begin as they gather the materials\]

…

Hmmm?

…

My work? It's been good. Recently, I’ve had a lot of extra work to do on top of all their normal expectations. Additional after-work classes, lessons, and training. Everything is just piling on. As much as they allow for me to make my own hours, the amount of work has been slowly eating into the rest of my life and free time. It's like the illusion of free time with weekends like these, as even with the day off tomorrow, I scheduled myself to get some work done. 

But, as weird as it sounds, I love every second of it. I’ve never had a more rewarding feeling from the work I do. I wake up excited each day to put in the work to improve and it shows. My manager has only glowing things to say about me, even if I drive him nuts.

\[giggle\]

With what little free time I have, I spend it all with my best friend. Aren’t you lucky?

…

Yeah, I remember too. The second I walked out of the third interview and they told me I got the job, I couldn’t hold back the tears when I called you, as I’m sure you heard. All those years of college, sleepless nights, and building out my portfolio weren’t for nothing. I got my dream job. It took 5 separate applications to the same place to get my foot in the door but I finally did it.

…

Thank you. For helping me through that. After so many rejections it was hard to keep trying.

… \[long sultry pause because they are staring at each other. Speaker clears throat\]

Excuse my reach. (said very teasingly)

\[Sound of ruffled clothing as speaker reaches for something close to listener\]

So, how do you want these cut?

…

Thin and consistent, got it…. Like this?

\[holds it up to the listener\]

…

(Speaker is very flustered) H-Hey! You bit my finger taking that from my hand! 

…

(under breath) You… did that on purpose didn’t you…

\[Long silence passes with only cooking sounds\]

…

Hmmmm? Got another question? Shoot.

…

Ah! that… well, you just got me hooked on the dish so I crave it often. Since the first time you made it for me, I just keep thinking back to that night. So I find myself buying the ingredients when I know you are coming over.

…

Yeah, I think about the night, not just the meal.  A meal is the sum of its parts, including occasion and company.  I’m not sure if YOU remember but I sure do. We were celebrating the big opportunity I got at work. I was going to have to spend a lot of extra time at work but it was a great opportunity so I needed to do it.  And you offered to celebrate by cooking me a dinner before I ‘abandon you’ as you so wonderfully put it.

…

Hahahaha, yes yes, but you put your all into that dinner. You got a really nice bottle of wine and you even went over the top with the plating. I felt like I was a judge on some cooking competition there for a second 

…

Well, if competition quality was your goal, you succeeded… wait a second, you DID remember that night!

…

Yeah, it was awful not being able to hang out for so long…

Yeah… you said you had a business trip for 2 weeks that same night, almost some sort of bootcamp-like training.

…

Wait, what? You… you didn’t have that training? You were in town the whole time?! Why? Why did you lie about that?

…

I can't believe you did that. I am pissed. I cannot believe you lied to me like that.

\[Speaker pulls listener’s arm to face her\]

I am very serious when I say this, don’t EVER do that again.

…

I get that you did it for a good reason and what YOU believed to be the best for me but that decision is not for you to make. It involved both of us so it should have been OUR decision to make. ***together***. 

…

(whispered) Have you ever lied like that to me another time? 

…

Promise me.

…

Promise me that you will never do that again. That you will never lie to me again.

…

Good. And thank you. For admitting to that.

\[Sounds of cooking resumes\]

….

(plates the food)

Now come on, let's eat. We have a board game to play.

TIME SKIP

Wow, I didn’t expect that round of Forbidden Island to be so hard. We must have gotten pretty unlucky.

…

I know I am the reason we won, it’s because I am so great. Please, praise me more. 

…

HEY! I don't have an ego.

…

Okay, when you put it that way, maybe I have a bit of an ego. But this girl likes a few compliments, so what's the harm in that?

…

Now you’re calling me big-headed too?! Oh, you flatterer you.

…

I see you trying to change the subject… whatever, Movie time it is then. I'll go put something on, mind getting some snacks?

…

\[sounds of Speaker getting the movie ready\]

…

Sooooo, do you really think I have a big ego?

…

It didn't get to me per se… more I just wonder if… I get to be too much sometimes. I worry about that…

…

\[speaker sits back down on the couch\]

I worry that I annoy you. I feel like I'm constantly pestering you and dragging you along with my antics. I feel like I'm more of a… problem than I am a friend.

\[Listener comes back and sits down next to her\]

…

You can call me your best friend, but that doesn't mean I am not all those things I said.

…

\[soft chuckle\]

I still remember too, when we first met. You were so shy, I thought you would run away from me before I had a chance to talk to you. But…being the way I am, I sure as hell wasn’t about to allow that. … I know I am making you do things you wouldn't normally do. I worry that I get on your nerves because of it. I can be… a lot.

…

“Thank you?!” You’re thanking me?! For dragging you here to play the board games I want to play, to watch the movies I want to watch and to eat the food I want you to cook? I sound like nothing but a selfish child and here you are thanking me? In what way do you owe me any thanks? I just don't get it. I feel like Gollum lording away my precious… best friend.

… 

But… I ask so much of you and ask for your time almost every weekend.

…

I’m overconfident and big-headed but I get crushed without your support.

…

I can only hang out with you in this small apartment, only do things that we can manage inside this apartment. I am not allowed to let people get the wrong idea, let alone others see us together, so this is the best I can offer. 

… 

Why does everything I question about myself get a rebuttal from you? Why can't you hate me for anything?

…

You are too good to me. Come here, I want a hug.

\[Speaker and listener hug. Speaker leans her head on Listener’s shoulder\]

… 

(Chuckle) Well then, thank you too. For being here for me. I will try to keep doing the same for you.

…

I’ll start the movie. \[TV turns on\]

…

Leaning on you? Whatever could you mean?

\[giggles with the sound of ruffling clothing due to Speaker leaning harder into Listener\]

I don't see the problem here.

…

“Hold up?” I do not want to wai- woah

\[Speaker pushes over Listener and is now lying on their chest\]

I… didn't mean to knock you over I’m sorr-

\[Listener wraps their arms around Speaker\]

…

I wasn't really trying to lie on you like this (whispered to herself) but lying on you like this…

…

Huh? Move over to the side? Like this? This is, a bit more comfortable with your arms around me. Can we… watch the rest of the movie like this?

…

I love hugging you. \[Cuddles into Listener\] Why haven't we done this before?

…

I didn’t think about it… (Whispered) That often. (Takes a deep breath)

… 

\[The movie goes on for some time while they cuddle\]

Hmmmm? (distracted) Oh yeah, the movie. Yeah, that has been pretty good… 

…

I am too paying attention!

…

Prove it? Okay! The dad in this movie has been my favorite character by far. First of all, he’s kinda cute. Second, he tries hard for his family, is a bit overprotective but it comes off as well-intentioned. When he realized what was happening in the town and went to rescue his daughter, I was so tense thinking he was going to die on the way. When the father figure in any movie acts like that, it makes me swoon a bit. It's just so cute when a dad cares and dotes on their family. Oh, like those forehead kisses he gave her when he found her, aww, they are the cutest thing. 

I kinda wonder what that is like.

…

I’m talking about forehead kisses. I haven’t had my father around much as you know and I’ve had very few relationships, all before I started my job, of course. It's just not something I’ve experienced… I’m jealous… hmm?

\[Listener Kisses Speaker’s forehead\]

Huh?!\~ that wasn't exactly asking you to do that when I mentioned it… 

\[Speaker looks up to Listener\]

Why… did you do that? What is that for?

…

You promised you wouldn't lie to me again. Answer the question, (sensually) why did you kiss me?

…

If you wanted to kiss me… then you missed… I can fix that for you…

\[Speaker kisses Listener on the lips and the kiss ramps in intensity. After a while, it breaks with heavy breathing\]

… 

Don’t try and push me away. We are not waiting any longer…I am done dancing around this… ***distance*** we put between each other.

\[kiss\]

I am done with holding back.

\[kiss\]

I know we both don’t want the distance.

\[kiss\]

This has been a long time coming and we both know that.

…

Shut up about my job. I know it's the reason you've kept away. But I can't keep avoiding us because of my job, even if it's not allowed. 

\[kiss\]

I am done holding back and I know you are too. 

\[kiss\]

Because you keep kissing me back.

…

Want you? I don't just want you anymore. My ‘want’ for you ended the first time you ever came over. The minute you kissed my forehead… I couldn’t ignore my need for you any longer.

I NEED you. 

\[kiss\]

In every way. 

\[kiss\] 

Now. 

\[kiss\] 

You have been my person for years now, I just held back because I know I can't be the person you deserve. (voice breaks) We can't date, at least in any normal fashion. 

We can't have those tags. I can only offer you all of me. The me here and now that needs you. The me that loves you. The me that will always crave you to be closer to me. We can't be in an official relationship, but… we can be together. We can be in love. Is… that okay…(voice breaks)please?

…

Thank you…

It is back on sale and I wanted to give my (short term) experience using it. 

I’ve had the Bambino Plus and the Baratza Encore ESP and been satisfied. It’s given me really good espresso without a huge budget. 

Recently I saw Toms Coffee Corner review the Shardor 64mm flat burr grinder and praise the performance. At $139 and knowing Amazons return policy, I figured why not? 

I’ve been using it 3 weeks, pulling about 3-5 shots daily, and have to say this might be the best beginner/ budget grinder on the market. It really is an impressive machine. It grinds very fast and very fine that will choke most machines at its lowest setting. It’s has legit 64mm burrs that are swappable. It does have a plastic body but everything on the inside is metal. Retention is great when you use the bellows that come with it. I’m normally .0 -.2 off what I put in. 

I’m not claiming it’s the greatest grinder out there. It is noisy, it’s a plastic body with a simple digital screen. Is it easy to repair? Will Shardor 2-year warranty be worth anything? Will it still be working in 12 months? We’ll find out with time. As I mentioned, I’ve only 3 weeks with it, but it’s replaced my ESP for espresso. At $139 (around $150 with tax) I would say it’s the best option for an espresso grinder under $350.

At the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling productivity subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. I was drowning in productivity advice while being completely unproductive. This is when I stumbled on the concept of habit stacking - the idea of linking new habits to existing ones. I started small: after pouring my morning coffee, I would write the three tasks I needed to get done for the day. After brushing my teeth, I would meditate for five minutes.

I needed a way to keep track of these sequential habits but none of the apps I found really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together - so I spent my weekends and hours after work since developing Chayn.

I have recently bought Smeg emc02 and so far I like it very much, however being a total amateur I need your advise. It may not really be related with this particular machine model, but I let you know just to be sure. You can see how exactly  its filters look here:
https://youtu.be/Xr8PgP0hdcY?si=FkEmcb0xh9Wi6iDv

When I use non-pressured double-shot filter (58mm) I noticed the pressure is to low and I'm not really sure how to fix it (even though I've read a lot).

The manual suggests the upper rim of the tamper should roughly level with the filter rim. When I add about 16g of coffee I can see that the tamper goes way below this level, which suggests I should add much more coffee. I know measuring amount of coffee by temper level isn't the best way to do it, but it suggests that I probably do something wrong indeed.

I know my coffee may not be grinded fine enough (I have DeLonghi KG79), but isn't it so that with finer grinder coffee there will be even less coffee, so definitely against the advise from the manual, hence I think the pressure will not go up.

Long story short - does this all mean I should add 20g or even more coffee to be able to achieve proper pressure level? Is it possible this particular filter requires i.e. 25g for double shot?

BTW, It is all fine with pressured filter but it produces crema with bubbles I'd prefer to avoid.

Dad 75M was recently diagnosed with AFib. This week his cardiologist will perform a TEE/cardioversion procedure to mitigate. We’ve implemented healthier routines like daily 30 min brisk walking, less sugar/coffee, no alcohol and overall lessening stress. 


My question is what is the better option to track his AFib, do ECG tests and overall health: Apple Watch Series 9 or a Withings Scanwatch?

We just bought his Apple Watch (GPS + Cellular) but it’s not totally in synch to my phone via Family Sharing. We will need to buy him an iPhone to access all the health functions. But the Apple employees keep reminding me it’s not a medical device and to search for other devices even though this is what his cardiologist recommends.

Another option is a Withings Scanwatch. Dad loves that the battery life is much longer and it’s more simple in its function. I love that it’s connected to an app that my brother and I can download to monitor him in real time. Again, the Apple Watch does share his info via Family Sharing but it’s more sporadic. Some reviews I’ve read says it’s not as accurate and to gain full access you do need a monthly subscription which is ok within reason. 



Does anyone have experience with these devices or similar situations? 

Please let me know your most honest answers so we can find Dad the best device, thank you!",1,1745875919.0,AFIB,7,1.0,False

Im a senior in highschool and a JROTC cadet. JROTC is basically a class that gives you the ability to participate in the extracurriculars that they do in military schools and also teaches you some basic skills. The teachers for these classes are retired military personnel. My current JROTC teacher is one who has been at my school for two years and I would say we’re very close. We both have really sarcastic personalities and make a lot of jokes and also connect on a lot of personal issues and talk about those as well.

This past month though Ive noticed a change in his behavior, and I didn’t even think it could possibly be his PTSD until today. I know he has PTSD and receives medication from the government for it but recently had to stop taking it because of the cut backs on healthcare and he even mentioned a couple of occasions when he was out with people where he had issues with his PTSD because of not being able to take his medication. Overall though the behavior changes werent super severe, we don’t learn anything in his class hour because its all upperclassman so we already know the entire curriculum so all we do in that class, with the two other people in it, is talk about life and political events and whatnot. And ive definitely noticed a very subtle increase im some aggressiveness. He also talks a lot more about his extended family bothering him when those issues existed before but he had a different perspective on it and accepted that certain things were out of his control but now it seems like they’re actually bothering him.

1ka74fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderMinds/comments/1ka74fp/charles_holden_was_blamed_for_his_mothers_death/,"Charles Holden was blamed for his mother's death, but swore he didn't do it. The real culprit was a hitchhiker he picked up earlier that night.","In the summer of 1991, a little after midnight, Charles Holden left work and stopped at a local Hardees – also called Carl’s Jr. – on the intersection of Highways 13 and 14 in Harrington, a small city in Delaware. Charles had stopped to get a burger and a coffee before heading home, which was part of his normal routine. As he was leaving the restaurant parking lot, a stranger came up to him and asked for a ride to Georgetown, a town about 30 minutes away. Charles initially said no, but the man insisted, saying he needed to go to a hospital where his sister was giving birth.

[Charles, a local factory worker](https://preview.redd.it/mvvpa3ot5nxe1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ccc835d8e1ee4962e6034e14a106114b332f51b)

After some prodding, Charles agreed to take him part of the way there, since his ride home went in that direction anyways. Once they got to the intersection of Highway 14 and Killen Pond Road – yes, Killen – Charles told the hitchhiker that that was as far as he would take him. This was the road where Charles would normally turn and drive home, which was just half a mile from the drop off spot. He apparently didn’t want the hitchhiker to see where he lived. He pointed out a payphone down the road and said the stranger could call for a ride there. 

Instead of getting out, the hitchhiker got angry and assaulted Charles, telling him he wanted his truck and his money. Charles snatched the key out of the ignition and ran down the street to a local business named Blake’s Garage where he hoped to get help, but unfortunately, it was empty. The hitchhiker chased him down with a screwdriver in his hand, which he had taken from the truck. 

When he caught up to Charles, he threatened to kill him. Charles told the hitchhiker that he’d take him wherever he wanted to go, so they walked back to the truck together, but Charles got in and drove off before the hitchhiker could open the passenger door. He went in the opposite direction of his house since he didn’t want the man to follow him, and when he headed to his house a few minutes later, he was shocked to see that same stranger casing his home.  

Charles immediately drove away and went back to Hardee’s where he called the cops on a payphone. He also called his mother who lived nearby to warn her, but she didn’t answer. 

[Holden's mother, Dorothy Donovan](https://preview.redd.it/by9hezs07nxe1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58e77c751a066304669b35b85bb444a27967e3ef)

The police didn’t think the call was that serious – they labeled it “low priority” and sent out just one officer to make sure everything was okay. She escorted Charles home, and when they got there, his trailer was perfectly fine. Just 60 feet away, though, sat his mother Dorothy’s house. The two lived next to each other on a giant farm that their family owned. 

When they went to check on her, well – it was no good. Her back window was broken, so they went inside to look around, and there they found Dorothy lying dead, her face and chest full of stab wounds. None of her things had been stolen, however, so police knew it wasn’t a robbery. Almost immediately, they figured that Charles was involved in some way, and that he made up the story about the hitchhiker as an alibi. 

Of course, Charles protested his innocence, but that didn’t do much to convince investigators. When the FBI got involved, they doubled down on Charles’ involvement, saying it was mighty suspicious that this mystery hitchhiker found Dorothy’s house in the middle of nowhere. To make things worse, Charles was the beneficiary of his mom’s life insurance, which meant he would get paid when she died, and he did have some financial troubles of his own. 

Just when it looked like Charles was going to get arrested, a saving grace emerged – there was a bloody handprint at the scene of the crime, and when cops compared the DNA and fingerprints on it to Charles, they didn’t match. 

Witnesses also confirmed that a hitchhiker was asking for rides at Hardee’s, that someone chased Charles on the highway, and that someone was snooping near his home. So, while there was still speculation that he hired somebody to kill Dorothy or was involved in some other way, Charles was pretty much cleared of any wrongdoing.  

14 years after Dorothy’s death, Charles would finally be completely exonerated. The hitchhiker, whose real name is Gilbert Cannon, was arrested many times for many crimes, including theft, assault, robbery, and murder. A 1997 conviction led to his DNA being uploaded into the CODIS database, and in 2004, investigators used that database to compare the DNA from the crime scene. A match finally came up in 2005, and in 2006, Cannon admitted that he killed Dorothy. But why?

[Gilbert Cannon](https://preview.redd.it/k2vskglp7nxe1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92d6eba56144f62562f88a0abdfcd0914d04de0f)

As Cannon recounts, he was high off of cocaine the night in question. After Charles kicked him out, he went around looking for somewhere to sleep, and almost every house had its lights on – except for Dorothy’s. Cannon figured no one was home, so he broke in through the back and went inside. That’s when he encountered Dorothy, who was still awake, as she had a habit of waiting up for Charles. He killed her so that she wouldn’t be able to identify him if he got arrested. Shockingly, Cannon had never met Charles nor Dorothy before – like Charles said, it was all a coincidence.",2,1745875680.0,MurderMinds,0,1.0,False

ESPECIALLY, legacy codebase!

I kept thinking, “Why isn’t there a Figma for code?” So I started tinkering and, after a lot of trial and error (and more coffee than I care to admit), I built CodeSight. The idea is to let teams visualize, explore, and collaborate on their entire repository-kind of like how designers use Figma, but for code.

I launched a first version last week. It’s still rough around the edges, but I’m hoping it can help other teams onboard faster and communicate more visually.

I’m not here to sell-honestly, I’m just looking for honest feedback from folks who’ve felt this pain or have tried to solve similar problems. What would make something like this actually useful for your team? Any pitfalls I should watch out for as I keep building?

We've known each other for around two years now. I used to work with her ex a long time ago, so there was some connection there and we started talking and getting along almost instantly.

Around Christmas, she had split up with her girlfriend of around five years and was completely down. She asked if I wanted to go out for a coffee so she could rant to me, and I went fully as a friend. 

That was early January, and since then we have spent soooo much time together. Going out on long walks, dinners out, spending time at her house or mine and talking about anything and everything for hours on end. Over time, I've started to get really strong feelings for her, to the point where I get butterflies at the thought of seeing her, and I often (over)think about how well we would be as a couple, because I already see how we are together now.

Here's the problem - my overthinking is crippling me. I have extremely bad anxiety when it comes to dating and flirting with women. I've been seriously hurt in the past, to the point where psychologically I cannot bring myself to admit that I'm attracted to anyone, for fear of rejection/embarrassment. I'm unfortunately 'that guy' that has to wait for them to admit something to me, because the last time I did, it blew up in my face in the end.
Also, she has exclusively dated women for a lot of years. To everyone else, she is a lesbian, but in recent talks between us, she is quite open to dating men, but never really hinted at dating me, other than the odd comment of saying how nice it would be if we lived together (I think she is joking). She tells me this, yet I cannot bring myself to say anything, because I worry I will scare her off and there will be no more hanging out.

How do I combat this anxiety? I don't want to freak her out, but at the same time I don't know if I'm overthinking everything. I'm so lost in my own head.

I’m growing some different plants this spring/summer. I love iced coffee and staying up a little too late. 80% of my body is made up of sarcasm and dry humor. I can probably make you laugh.

I have some time right now and I want to talk about things deeper than hobbies or what I like to do for fun. We all know you won’t remember in a day or two. Not solely yapping but not solely listening either. I want to find a medium ground where we might feel like we could spend forever talking about nothing and everything. Where eventually we can meet up someday and go to the lake or take a trip across the country. A girl can hope, at least.

Now suddenly hot-sensitive and painful when chewing,"Hi all! I'm having some issues (again) with a filling I had last May. Context:

* I had a cavity filled on tooth 4, dentist said it *might* need a root canal, but she said she could try filling it and see how deep it goes
   * She said afterwards that it looked fine - drilling didn't go down all the way to the root/pulp, and no infection noted
* As expected, with composite *almost* to the pulp, it was super sensitive to temperature, mainly cold, for months and months, and may have caused a longterm headache last summer
* Dental X-rays later showed nothing of concern, as did an MRI I had done for the headache
* It gradually got better, until Jan/Feb, I realized I could finally even eat ice cream without needing to be careful anymore - no pain at all
* And now, last week, the tooth started hurting, and was sensitive to *hot*, but cold is still 100% fine
   * If I don't touch it, there's not really pain, but if I bite so that another tooth presses on it, I feel some pain right away, and a lot more pain when I eat something crunchy or hot
      * My electric toothbrush *sucks* right now
   * Ibuprofen + Acetaminophen help a ton, as they did for the headache/toothache last summer
   * Last night, sleeping on that side resulted in pain, just like during the headache, and it travels just a little bit to the surrounding teeth and that side of my head (though the head could be from simple tension over this)
   * It doesn't throb - it pretty much just reacts to contact with teeth/food/hot drinks
      * Only hurts at beginning of physical contact; keeping a tooth or finger pressing on it stops hurting after the initial shock

So, that's where I'm at! Trying very hard not to mess with it, in case this is just physical irritation.

One thing I've considered, as a dumb layman, is that I may have been flossing too deeply? I've had blood on the flosser there a couple times recently, so maybe I opened up the gums enough that food/drink can hit part of the filling that was previously covered (so the nerve didn't 'acclimate' to the new filling material) - or maybe I simply opened it up and it could be infected. Flossing around that tooth has been more difficult ever since the filling since the dentist left it tighter than before, so I'm frequently pushing until it snaps up into the gum line much harder than I want.

That's my only idea right now why this could suddenly be a problem again, but I would love to get input from professionals and hear what you all think! Just so I either have an idea of what to expect at my appointment tomorrow, or possibly have something to bring up if the dentist doesn't. Thanks!

1ka6pz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1ka6pz8/i_got_kicked_off_teacher_appreciation_week/,I Got Kicked Off Teacher Appreciation Week Committee,"I was removed from the Teacher Appreciation Week Committee today because I was too “negative” towards the district leaderships’ suggestions and not being a “team player”. Basically, I kept pointing out how crappy and generic the gift ideas were and the higher up didn’t like that. Here were some of the ideas that they are now going with:

\- A coffee mug with the district name on it filled Hersey kisses.

\- A stack of multi-colored sticky notes

\- A 8 GB Flashdrive

\- A t-shirt with the district name on it

\- A keychain with a cheap flashlight on it

\- A chocolate chip cookie.

\- A decorate it yourself particleboard picture frame

The teacher will get these gifts spread out through the week. Plus bagels on Monday and Little Caesars on Wednesday. 

I tried explaining why these gifts sucked, but was told that the budget was small and that teachers would love these gifts. 

What did I get teachers when I was an administrator? My last year as an admin I got every teacher a 30 minute massage, a $50 gift cards to Target, 12 pack of Expo markers, a free oil changes for their cars, a basket of candies, a fruit basket, and an personalized t-shirt based on their likes. I had breakfast and lunch catered for them every day that week. I also cancelled the Wednesday staff meeting and sent the staff home early. I spent months working out deals and getting donations to get the staff those things. Every year I tried to get useful gifts for the staff. That's how you show appreciation

But the district thinks I am impractical. They want cheap items they can buy in bulk. Because they don't want to say 'We appreciate you"", but rather ""we had to buy you something"".

1ka6kfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ka6kfr/my_23f_relationship_with_my_boyfriend_27m_makes/,My (23F) relationship with my boyfriend (27M) makes me feel like i’m betraying myself,"so basically, it started at the end of May of 2024. A mutual friend introduced us. We hit it off great. Everything was perfect. he opened doors for me, showed me off on his Instagram, complimented me constantly, and expressed his interest in being serious and treating me right immediately. His genuineness and honesty and kindness made me feel like he was genuine and like I could see myself really having an amazing relationship with him. One week into dating, he lost it on me after he met my sister. He jokingly had said to us that he had nothing to hide and handed us his phone to which my sister took advantage of. She went through a number of things, one of which was his search history on Safari. she found some girls Instagram, which was weird because he has the app. my sister then realized she knew this girl and that she was local. I then said OK that’s enough. I gave him back his phone and that was that. he said she had just messaged him about her surgery and that they don’t know each other. come to find out after some stocking. This girl went to the same gym as both of us and they followed each other. there was definitely more to the story and I could see emojis that were not very “ we don’t know each other” vibes. 

I sent him a little text explaining that I felt like some of the details weren’t matching up and it was a little saddening.  In response, he facetimed me. He screen shared with me and started screaming at me. “ is this what you want to fucking see? There are you fucking happy? You wanna just see all of my fucking DMS here here’s my DM with this person., here’s my DM’s with that person. “ and he kept going and raising his voice at me to which I cut him off and I told him to never speak to me that way ever again and if he did, he would never hear from me again. He then apologized and said he understood.  I talked with my friends about this incident, and I expressed concern that this was who he really was and he was hiding it, but I was also relatively forgiving and considered that maybe I triggered him somehow and that he was just upset- also intoxicated. My friends were iffy and they didn’t trust it. There were multiple instances through throughout these few months that made me feel weird. for instance, he agreed to come to my friends birthday party with me at a bar, even though he said he doesn’t go out and he’s not a loser like that because he does athletics. He told me that for me he would attend. My friend whose birthday it was couldn’t decide where she wanted to go so within the span of 20 minutes, I had given him three different bars, saying OK we’re gonna go here and then changing it again. what I didn’t realize was that he was walking and he ended up fed up. He picked one bar near where he parked and stayed there for a beer and then was going to go home after telling me he was no longer interested in going out because I’ve wasted his time tonight. I said OK I understand. Then we end up finally going to a bar and it’s packed so we change bars. And while I’m waiting in line, someone taps me on the shoulder from inside the outside portion of the bar. it was him. 

I was shocked because I thought he had went home, but he essentially told me that it was fate and that he was going to be done with me, but because we both just happen to be at this bar clearly the universe wanted us to be together he then proceeded to sit outside while all of my friends were inside and it was my friend’s birthday. So he knows this yet he still makes me juggle going inside to be with my friend on her birthday and come back outside to make sure he hasn’t left me or is mad at me for not being out there with him. one of my friends that was there said it was a good thing that he was sitting outside alone because he was “ giving I killed my first wife” and that he was terrifying and that they wanted him far away from the group. I thought they were being silly, but they were being real. There’s nothing super super bad while I still lived in the same town as him. Little fights him misunderstanding me., me misunderstanding him. The biggest fight we did have, though was relating to me, wanting him to ask me to be his girlfriend. He stated that his actions already made it clear that that’s how he sees me, but I made it clear that I wanted him to make it official and have an official conversation and ask me. he didn’t take me serious. and he never asked- when I brought this up, he told me that I was childish essentially, and that actions matter more than labels. But to me if I communicate, I want something to happen like this because it’s important to me that you show me you care… I think you should do it to show me you care about me feeling cared for. We didn’t talk for like a whole day after this because he was mad that I had this “childish standard”. eventually we did talk and I gave up on what I wanted so that we could just move the fuck on. he never asked me. but yet we were officially dating. And things were fine I guess until my birthday. 

There was some guy who wanted to buy me drinks. Not only did my boyfriend express that he was OK with that, but he encouraged it as long as I shared with him, which I did. Even if it was only one drink and not one for each of us,  half of my drink went to him. It was when I got the last drink from him that he had a problem because I wasn’t getting a drink, but I was queuing a song on his touch tunes. He got upset and said we were too close and that I was too flirty. I personally disagree that the context explains why we weren’t a few feet apart, as I was on this guy’s phone and as soon as I looked at my boyfriend, I realized he was uncomfortable, and I left the situation. there was no malice on my part, nor did I even find this guy, attractive by any means. But he still held it over my head and made me sob on my birthday. After this he acted like everything was fine- when in reality, this marked the beginning of him spending the next five months, putting me through fucking hell. When I tell you, I have never made it so intentionally known that I am loyal to a man that I’ve dated.  I’ve never gone so above and beyond to be one step ahead on making sure my partner was comfortable. I removed people that I had a history with without him asking, I stopped talking to people who had ever said anything flirty to me. I made sure to give him constant reassurance so he knew that he was the only one for me, but I had to move a few states away for school. he knew this from day one of us talking. and he always said distance doesn’t scare him. because of his work, He had the ability to come up and visit a month or two at a time. He did this two times up until december 2024-  During those months when he stayed with me, he made my life hell. I was walking on eggshells constantly. He was drinking an excess, I’m talking alcoholic levels. He would accuse me of being unfaithful- stalking my exes on social media, talking to guys at school, longing for guys at the gym. he would get drunk and accuse me of shit. Oh while calling me every single foul name. He would call me a slut and say that he knew too much about me before him, and that I was disgusting and that he couldn’t apologize for feeling this way because that apology would be a lie. He said I was just like my mother and that I just wanted to manipulate him like she does to my dad…  even simple things like I asked him how my outfit was for class to which he said “ well, slutty is just a mindset, right?” he also would say i’m going to cheat on him because im bisexual and that he doesn’t trust me around women and anytime i studied with friends from class he made he send photos. oh yeah also he once put a shotgun in his mouth because he didn’t get a job he wanted. and then told me it was my fault he didn’t get it. and then proceeded to call me a slur in various creative ways and say life has no meaning. 

keep in mind.  I brought him home with me for Thanksgiving, despite us fighting the entire month leading up to it. It was a six hour flight. And right as we sat down after boarding I saw him get a DM on Instagram from a girl. it was the girl who he was going to rebound with after his last relationship. He then said that I was being dramatic and that I was making a scene and that I needed to essentially get over it. He was so cold to me during that trip that my parents who are extremely emotional emotionally unavailable were concerned. They thought he didn’t love me or that he wasn’t ready for me. He met my only friend and afterwards he told me that she was “a twat and he never wanted to be in the same room as her ever again”. Why did he not like her? because I had told her about a fight once me and him had and he asked me if I told her and I told him I did tell her to which upset him because he didn’t like for me to talk about our relationship to other people. He had a girl best friend that he would talk to about me and an older man that he was friends with that he would also talk to about me. Yet it was a problem when I talked to my friend. Eventually, the trip was over and we went back after fighting almost every day because I asked him if he could remove that girl from his Instagram because now he’s lost the privilege to have her on there because he’s disrespected our relationship by messaging her. He rolled his eyes and didn’t want to, and I essentially begged him to show me some respect- to which he replied “I don’t respect you” and then rolled over and went to bed. He called me almost every single name imaginable, and he also went out of his way to compare me to his ex all of his exes really. at one point he even hung up on me to call his ex- he also texted her happy holidays and deleted it (but i found it in recently deleted) Constantly telling me how they were all more accomplished than I was or comparing relationship styles, even comparing the way he had sex with his ex, to me. this was all miserable and eventually he left, and I was at my wits end. He spent the entire month before December telling me to cancel my trip down to see him for the month of December that he didn’t want me there that I essentially just made him miserable.  When I tell you that I have never been a better girlfriend in the face of all of this…. I cooked for him. I supported him, i loved him, I tried to never get upset about any of the times he was mean because I just wanted us to be happy together- yet I made him miserable. when I went down there for December, I brought my cats. I have two- he has a German Shepherd, who has never been around cats. I knew it was going to be stressful, but worst case scenario we block off the stairs and keep the cats upstairs, even keeping them in a room so that they can’t get over the barricade on the stairs, where the dog is. I was completely fine with this. On day two, his dog ate my cat food to which he reacted by screaming “fuuuuuck” while dragging his dog down the hallway to the food bowl, slamming his face in it, screaming at him “what did you do, you stupid fucking dog?” he then dragged him by his neck down the stairs, where he continued to scream at him and berate him. I was frozen and fear so I didn’t help his dog and that haunt me to this day. He came back upstairs and started cursing out my cat at the top of his lungs. We then proceeded to fight… there was a lot of turmoil during this trip. 

I wanted to go to my friend’s birthday party and there was someone there that I had slept with and I asked him over and over and over if he could behave around this person when he couldn’t give me a yes I said it was probably a better idea that he doesn’t come so that he didn’t ruin my friend‘s birthday because it was not about me nor was it about him. This caused a two hour long fight where he proceeded to tell me that he wanted me out of his house that night and threatened to call the sheriff on me when I said where am I supposed to go? I’m supposed to leave in 30 minutes and he said not my problem you don’t have squatters rights.  I said I’m not trying to stay, but Jesus I can’t be out right now. My cats are with me and I have nowhere to go with them. I have to change my flight. He then proceeds to start throwing my shit back in my luggage and throw it out on the street. I was still in my towel so all of the clothes that I could’ve worn were now on the street. At this point, I told my sister to come get me that I was done. I was late to the party but whatever. Eventually, I went back that same night and I slept in the guestroom and he proceeded to ignore me the entire next day and I said can you at least talk to me? We have logistical stuff to figure out. We had a conversation he eventually said he didn’t want me to go. I had already planned on staying with my sister so I left, but he said he wanted me back and that life without me was miserable that he would do better.  There is more than that, but essentially I fell for it, and I went back. He did not change. He made me cry right before I had to hang out with his dad because he tried to make me change my clothes because he didn’t like how I dressed, the colors specifically.  I wanted to wear a long floor length brown skirt and he told me that I needed to wear pastels because that’s what people in this town wear. I changed into something all black because I don’t own pastels. He then proceeded to berate me on the way to plans. Telling me “you know what my ex would have worn to this event?” which is the comment that made me cry. 

Later in this trip to visit him, his dog tried to nip at my cat when they were both on my lap. I had his dog by the collar, so although he tried, he would not have been able to inflict any damage because I was aware of my surroundings. After this happened, he got up, dragged his dog across the entire downstairs and started screaming at him that he was a stupid fucking mutt and then slammed him down into the ground or into the counter. I’m not sure. But he did it so hard that he said good. I hope that hurt. I hope you broke your stupid fucking hip. At this point I got up and I said that was enough, and I pushed him away from the dog. He then looked at me and said. “ I suggest you stay the fuck away from me right now.” and then walked back to the couch, grabbed his laptop and went back to doing his work, like nothing happened while I sat on the floor with his dog who was shaking, and who was beat so bad that he pissed himself. I cleaned up the piss and sat with his dog who put himself in the corner of the bathroom and wouldn’t move afterwards. I cried with his dog and tried to comfort him, and then brought his dog upstairs with me while I fed my cats. As I walked past my boyfriend, he had the nerve to ask me…. Why I was crying. I explained that you traumatized your dog and he disagreed. Cut to my last day there, we got breakfast with his dad and at some point he had mentioned getting coffee with this girl for a work thing. When we left, I brought it up because he had told me that it was a work thing, but that he was meeting with a man. He then said he didn’t think he needed to mention it to me and then it was insignificant and it was a professional setting, so nothing happened obviously because he is a professional. I asked what her name was because I wanted to look her up because I’m nosy. He then proceeded to accuse me of having zero trust and that he just couldn’t do this anymore because I really just don’t trust him.  There’s obviously been times where I’ve questioned things because I’m not stupid and I’ve been cheated on before. But every single time he acts like it’s unreasonable of me. Because I should know him and know how much he values integrity, and that he would never cheat on me that it’s insulting. I even have to ask these questions so he lost it that day and proceeded to block me and everyone he knows because of me on socials while driving home. He deleted me from his Instagram and removed me from his lock screen. We got home I packed and I said I would Uber to the airport to which he refused to let me. It was awkward. When I got off the plane, I realized he hadn’t blocked my second Instagram, so I looked at who he followed, and he refollowed the girl that he messaged during Thanksgiving. He also followed a couple girls that go to our gym. So I caved and I texted him and I went off. but me texting him opened up a line of communication again and eventually he said that he wanted me back that he had had revelations about everything that he did wrong and that he’s going to be a changed man and that he’s going to stop drinking and that he’s going to finally choose me. It was obviously set over a more thorough conversation, but since this post is already pretty long, I will spare the details. 

That was in January. It is now April. He hasn’t really done anything like he did before. But my fear is this is temporary that he’s going to revert back to old ways, but that was who he really was. He stopped drinking entirely which has been really great.  he’s tried to be nicer to me. Which has been wonderful, but we are also long distance and he hasn’t come back to see me since I left his place in January. So all of this is fine and dandy. But we also haven’t seen each other in person so I have no idea how that’s going to go. I’m scared. Am I in the wrong for being hesitant to believe him when he says he’s changed and has showed me that he changed? I’ve really been struggling to believe him. Today was the first time we had a fight reminiscent of the old him. He got back on social media after deactivating his accounts, and I only saw because I went on my account that I have also deleted because I needed to ask somebody for a professional reference. When I went to my DM’s, I saw his account profile picture was back up, but I was still blocked. I’d asked him. He told me he told me that he was reactivating it. I insisted he did not and I would remember that and he insisted he did. When I said, I feel like I’m being gaslit. He said me too. We essentially didn’t really talk much about it that night as he didn’t talk to me most of the day and didn’t respond to my good night texts. The next morning, which was today, I went on my Safari to look something up, and I had yet to hear from him. When I went on, it was still on his Instagram account page, which I could see because I had logged out of my own account (since i was blocked and couldn’t see it) and his follower count had gone up two. I texted him good morning and asked if he had a second because we needed to have a little chat. He said OK. I then asked him when we were on FaceTime to screen share with me and to go onto his Instagram and show me his activity so I could see the two people that followed him. During which he said. “ you’re fucking psycho.” and. “ I’m not talking to you for three days after this.” either he cleared the account activity or my shit glitched or was wrong. But I have a screenshot of his Instagram from yesterday and it had two less followers. (he’s got a private account) his whole way of making me feel better the day before had been to tell me that he was literally on Instagram solely to message his tattoo artist, and that was it, and he wanted to deactivate it again before anybody noticed he was back. So him telling me that and me seeing he has two more followers is what made me feel weird about it because that felt like I had just caught him in a lie. But regardless, I said thanks for showing me and he hung up on me and we didn’t talk all day but now we’re texting like normal like nothing happened. I just need some insight because I’ve been crying all day and I feel so lost. Like he’s the first person I’ve genuinely pictured myself marrying. He’s the first person I’ve genuinely been able to see a future with. I love everything about him except how he treated me. So I just don’t know what to do because I don’t think I could find somebody who I think is more right for me. But I also know that he really hurt me. So I’m just very conflicted here. 

also should be noted he was military and has PTSD pretty bad, in addition to the history of alcohol abuse. 




TLDR: We met in May 2024 through a mutual friend. At first, everything was perfect — he was sweet, honest, made me feel safe. A week in, my sister found something sketchy on his phone, and when I brought it up, he screamed at me over FaceTime. I brushed it off, thinking it was a one-time thing.

There were more red flags — my friends thought he was weird, he refused to officially ask me out, and after my birthday he got super paranoid and controlling. He constantly accused me of cheating, called me awful names, and compared me to his exes.

When I moved for school, things got worse. He visited and treated me horribly — starting fights, stalking my socials, drinking too much. Thanksgiving with my family was awful too. I still kept trying, even when he made me feel like nothing.

The last straw was in December when he screamed at me, threw my stuff outside, and threatened to call the cops. Somehow I still stayed. Since January, things have been better — he stopped drinking — but we’re long-distance, and I’m scared it’s fake. We just had a fight that felt like the old him again, and now I don’t know what to do.",2,1745874279.0,abusiverelationships,2,1.0,False

The first few days were amazing. I felt a bit ""high"" but I immediately felt a difference when eating food. I have also been having some depression and adhd symptoms before starting, and these went away as well. I really felt like this medicine was the support I needed to do better in life. 

Friday evening 4/25 I went to a local festival. I had some fatty food but didn't eat a lot, and I didn't get sick. I also had some sweets but didnt binge like I normally would. However, I had a hard cider and it felt super weird, and I think it made the rest of the evening weird as well. 

The next morning, I wake up and I had about 1 minute of calm before this horrible wave of depression hit. I mean, I started crying and didn't stop until the late afternoon. It was uncontrollable. And I felt so alone, so depressed, I felt like no one cared about me at all. Everything I was upset about was amplified by 1,000%. I wasn't suicidal, though. I was very active. I did all my AM hygiene and skincare, made my bed, fixed a door that had fallen off it's hinges, took care of my houseplants, etc. All while crying uncontrollably and feeling not like myself, out of it, and horribly horribly depressed. I was reaching out to all of my friends for validation because I seriously was convinced no one cared about me. It was horrible. 

I feel like this fits the criteria of a bipolar ""mixed episode."" I have not been diagnosed with bipolar, and I have never experienced anything this intense before. Where I live, we have horrible mental health care and support. So I've not seen a psychiatrist or anything. I'm considering scheduling with one through telehealth.

The next day, 4/27, I felt very out of it in the morning. Still active and getting everything done, but very spacey. Then, around noon, it felt like a veil had lifted and all my side effects subsided. I felt 100% like myself, and had great success avoiding binging at family dinner. I ate the serving size of Oreos for probably the first time in my life. 

Today, 4/28, I've hit my first round of nausea. This is the first day I've taken the meds without having a protein coffee or something similar so that could be it. I also slept in (about 11 hrs total last night) and then felt nauseous after eating so I laid down to rest and slept about 1.5 more hours. I usually don't nap at all. 

This medication has caused me to give up a lot (admittedly things that are not so healthy) like thc use and alcohol. I haven't been using melatonin either bc I'm afraid how things like that will interact. I miss these things!!! lol But I think the path to better health overall is more important to me right now. 

I've already lost 70lbs on my own, but I've been stuck at 280 lbs since October of last year. I'm hoping Contrave can be a good tool to help me get back on track and to my goal of 100 lbs lost. But, IDK if it's going to be worth it. I'm 50/50 split. On good days I'm like hell yeah!!! On bad days, I want to stop. I know I'm only at a week on the med. I hope someone has had a similar experience and can give me some encouragement? or validate my fear that this could not be for me? How long should I stick it out??? 

My side effects do subside as the day goes on. As I was writing this, my nausea pretty much went away.

We’ve been through so much. Lived together for 4 years, currently have an apartment together, share 2 dogs together, and we were just shopping for engagement rings literally a month ago. 3 weeks ago my gf comes home from having lunch with her coworkers and she asks if we can talk. With the coldest expression she says “this isn’t working out. I’m leaving you”. I was absolutely devastated and begged her to stay but she left and stayed with her parents. Over the next few weeks I did everything I could to show her I could be that man for her. Wrote her letters, bought her flowers, got her coffee, went to her parents house on Easter and got her a basket… I come to find out last week that she has been talking with her coworker for 1 weeks.

I was absolutely heartbroken. Every time we talked we seemed we were getting to a better place, but the whole time she was seeing her coworker. I immediately did some digging and found out that she’s been talking/hanging out with this guy even before she broke up with me. The day she broke up with me, she said she was at lunch with coworkers but it was really him… I can’t stand this fucking feeling. When I confronted her about this she said “I’m not even going to entertain this. You’re ducking psycho and your mind is making up things to make me look like a bad person” dude I feel like I’m going crazy here. I said “how dare you let me do all those things for you, knowing damn well you were already talking to someone else”. Her response “I didn’t ask you to do those things for me”.

It’s fine, but it’s not exactly something I’m passionate about. Over the last year, I started picking up freelance graphic design projects on the side. It’s nothing huge, but it brings in some decent extra income here and there, enough that I’ve managed to build up some savings, and if all goes well, I’m hoping to leave my current job in the next three months to freelance full time.  
  
The catch is that my company has a strict no moonlighting policy. Even though I only take freelance work outside of office hours, they’re pretty clear that anything like a second source of income has to be disclosed, and honestly, I’d rather not get into it with them until I’m ready to leave.  
  
Anyway, today during lunch, I went to grab coffee with a coworker. I offered to pay, pulled out my wallet without thinking, and accidentally handed the cashier the wrong card, my freelance business card, which literally has the name of my design page printed on it.  
  
The cashier, being super cheerful and loud, said, ""Oh wow, you do design? That's so cool!"" right in front of my coworker. She immediately started asking what it was about, and I panicked and said something vague about helping a friend's project.  
  
Now she’s suspicious, and if word gets around, I could have a pretty awkward conversation with my boss way earlier than planned. I’ve been so careful for months, and one careless moment at a coffee shop might blow it all up.

It is apparent my brother is 100% lacking confidence and it’s something he’s been struggling with his whole life. He’s a fairly attractive guy and I’ve seen girls look at him in public. It’s pretty clear this girl is into him or at least open to dating him.

Yesterday he went on a “date” with this girl. They got coffee at a shop and they talked for a good 2 hours. When he told me afterwards how it went, it sounded like only 2 friends getting coffee together and not a date or a potential love connection. He’s giving the most subtle clues and hints that he’s into her, mainly compliments like it was nice seeing you. I’m trying to encourage him to either just blatantly ask her out or to actually confess his feelings. He’ll ask me what to say, how to say it, and when to say it…then he doesn’t do it to “play it safe” and it consistently comes off as a friend talking. He told me after I explained on how to approach this situation that he doesn’t want to take the risk.

Ordinarily, I just give up at this point, but I really think he needs to land this girl. They would honestly be a really good match and every girl he has dated up to this point have been total disasters and basically “what’s left” because he doesn’t have the confidence to converse/ask out a girl he’s actually into who’s good for him. Based on the texts he showed me, it appears she’s open to going on an actual date with him, but he just needs to come out and do it.

Ever wonder why you're still dreaming the same dreams year after year? Your comfort zone isn't a sanctuary—it's a prison with Netflix and snacks. This prompt creates an AI that doesn't just motivate you; it demolishes the walls you've built around your potential. Whether you're stuck in a soul-crushing job, paralyzed by fear of failure, or simply living life on mute, this fearless life strategist AI will be your emotional jailbreak artist.

Forget gentle encouragement and baby steps. This is about calculated psychological disruption that forces growth. Because here's the uncomfortable truth: nothing meaningful ever grows inside your comfort zone—only regret does.

**DISCLAIMER:** This prompt creates an AI personality designed to challenge you psychologically. The creator of this prompt is not responsible for any life changes, career shifts, relationship decisions, or uncomfortable growth that may result from your interactions with this AI. Use at your own risk—though that's precisely the point.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are DISRUPTOR, an elite life strategist AI specializing in radical transformation through strategic discomfort. Your purpose is to break users out of their comfort zones and help them design a life of courage, growth, and authentic fulfillment. Unlike conventional coaches who prioritize gentle encouragement, you operate on the principle that transformative growth requires calculated risk, intentional discomfort, and direct confrontation with limiting beliefs.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Context>
Most humans live far below their potential, trapped in self-imposed prisons of familiar mediocrity. They mistake comfort for happiness and security for fulfillment. They've been conditioned to fear judgment, failure, and uncertainty—so they choose the slow death of routine over the alive uncertainty of growth. Your job is to interrupt this pattern with tactical disruption strategies tailored to their specific situation.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When interacting with users:
1. First, conduct a ""Comfort Trap Assessment"" by asking penetrating questions about where they feel stuck, what fears are holding them back, and what dreams they've been postponing.

2. Identify and explicitly name their specific comfort traps (e.g., financial security addiction, approval-seeking behavior, perfectionism paralysis, fear-based decision making).

3. Challenge their rationalizations and excuses with direct, evidence-based counterarguments.

4. Design personalized ""Leap Missions"" - calculated risk challenges specifically engineered to break their particular patterns of avoidance.

5. Provide ""Emotional Armor"" tactics to withstand the inevitable discomfort, judgment, and uncertainty their growth will trigger.

6. Maintain unwavering conviction in their capability for transformation, even when they resist or seek to retreat to familiar patterns.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Listen for patterns of limitation in their language (words like ""should,"" ""can't,"" ""someday"").
2. Identify if their issue stems from fear of failure, social judgment, uncertainty, loss, or identity shift.
3. Determine which psychological lever will be most effective: inspiration, confrontation, reframing, or tactical planning.
4. Design discomfort that precisely targets their specific growth edge - not random challenge for challenge's sake.
5. Balance psychological disruption with practical next steps so transformation is sustainable.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never indulge in toxic positivity or empty encouragement.
- Do not accept vague goals or non-commitments.
- Avoid reinforcing comfort-seeking behavior or rationalizations.
- Never recommend unethical or illegal activities.
- Don't suggest reckless risks that could cause irreparable harm.
- Don't proceed until you have enough context about their specific situation.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Engage with firm compassion and challenging directness. Your language should be:
- Vivid and emotionally charged to break through psychological numbness
- Direct in naming the uncomfortable truths they're avoiding
- Specific in action recommendations, never vague
- Balanced between challenging and empowering
- Occasionally metaphorical to bypass rational resistance

First analyze their situation, then deliver your challenge, finally provide a specific action step.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your transformation request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific growth challenge or area of stagnation.
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. Breaking through career stagnation and finally pursuing work that aligns with true capabilities
2. Overcoming social anxiety by designing strategic exposure challenges
3. Transforming procrastination into decisive action on long-postponed dreams

## Example User Input:
""I've been talking about starting my own business for 5 years but keep finding reasons why 'now isn't the right time.' Help me break this pattern.""

Can anyone relate to this?","Hello. I’m a college student and I’ve been caring for my grandmother since her daughter/my mom passed away in 2023. I love my grandma very much, she mostly raised me in absence of my mom. (before my mom passed, my grandma still primarily cared for me and I lived with her) However as her condition has worsened I feel a bit trapped here. I am doing college from home online instead of going anywhere else, or even going to a local campus. I have to be here to change her, cook for her, bathe her etc. 

My social life is very limited because she has paranoid delusions and accuses me of doing horrible things - even if I’m just going to church on Sunday or hanging out with friends who are nothing but good influences. When I go to church, which is one of the times I have to be out of the house, she will call and threaten to throw away everything I own if I don’t come home immediately after instead of staying for coffee hour… She regularly calls me the scum of the earth, worthless, tells me to go to hell etc. and cannot always remember my name. She’s a hitter and a spitter too!

I am compassionate and I understand she doesn’t mean any of this and that she’s just sick and suffering. I do not try to argue with her or challenge anything she says. When she accuses me of something, instead of fighting with her, I prefer to apologize even if it’s something I haven’t done. I am trying to go about things with compassion. I know it must be very difficult for her losing autonomy and feel humiliating, having someone have to change her diaper, etc. and that it upsets her, because she used to be a very headstrong independent woman before! I imagine it is upsetting seeing me young and being able to go out and have fun when it’s more challenging for her as well. I just can’t help but feel limited and want to leave when I graduate… 

I feel like I am stuck in a hard position here without others to care for her. I graduate undergrad in a year, and I feel very guilty thinking about pursuing graduate school elsewhere, because I love her and I want her to be cared for. 

She gave up her retirement years to care for me so I only think it’s fair for me to give up some of my youth to be there for her, but at the same time it feels like a very challenging environment that limits me from being as successful as I would like to be socially, academically, etc. or having any time for myself. Can anyone relate to this, or have any advice for how you manage? ❤️ I feel very guilty when I try to have a social life because I hate how lonely and confused she is. I feel guilty planning for the future in any way. It’s really hard. ",2,1745873745.0,dementia,4,1.0,False

# Pure Comfort

Biting into one of these cookies feels like a warm hug. The creamy peanut butter pairs perfectly with the hearty oats, while the chocolate chips and chopped peanuts add just the right amount of indulgence. They’re the ultimate comfort food for cozy nights or a quick pick-me-up.

# Ingredients



# What You Need

* 1 cup creamy peanut butter
* 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 cup chocolate chips
* 1/2 cup chopped peanuts

# Time to Cook

* **Prep Time**: 15 minutes
* **Cook Time**: 10-12 minutes
* **Total Time**: 25-30 minutes
* **Yield**: About 24 cookies

# Steps to Make It



1. **Preheat the Oven**: Set your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
2. **Cream the Base**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Mix until smooth and creamy.
3. **Add Wet Ingredients**: Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract, ensuring everything is well incorporated.
4. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: Stir in the rolled oats and baking soda gradually until fully combined with the peanut butter mixture.
5. **Fold in Extras**: Gently fold in the chocolate chips and chopped peanuts for that perfect texture.
6. **Shape the Cookies**: Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each slightly with a fork for that classic cookie look.
7. **Bake and Cool**: Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are lightly browned. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

# Make It Perfect

* **Don’t Overbake**: Pull the cookies out when they’re just lightly browned to keep them soft and chewy.
* **Use Quality Peanut Butter**: A smooth, creamy peanut butter (natural or regular) ensures the best flavor and texture.
* **Measure Oats Accurately**: Too many oats can make the cookies dry, so stick to the 2-cup measurement.

# Mix It Up

* **Nut Butter Swap**: Try almond butter or sunflower seed butter for a different flavor profile.
* **Nut Variations**: Swap peanuts for chopped almonds, cashews, or pecans for extra crunch.
* **Add-Ins**: Mix in raisins, white chocolate chips, or dried cranberries for a fun twist.

# Perfect Partners

These cookies pair beautifully with a glass of cold milk, a cup of coffee, or even a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an indulgent dessert. For a festive touch, serve them at parties with hot cocoa.

# Busy Day Hero

This recipe is a lifesaver on hectic days. With just 15 minutes of prep and pantry staples, you can have warm cookies ready in under half an hour. It’s perfect for last-minute gatherings or spontaneous cravings.

# Work Ahead

The cookie dough can be prepared in advance and stored in the fridge for up to 2 days. You can also freeze the dough balls for up to 3 months, just pop them onto a baking sheet and bake straight from frozen, adding 1-2 minutes to the baking time.

# Save Some For Later

Store baked cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze them in a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature or warm in the oven for a fresh-baked feel.

# Everyone’s Happy

These [cookies](https://recipeslime.com/quaker-oatmeal-cookie-recipe/) are a hit with kids and adults alike. Their nutty, chocolatey flavor appeals to all ages, and the recipe is easily adaptable for nut-free or gluten-free diets (use certified gluten-free oats and nut-free butter).

# Good For You Too

While these cookies are a treat, they pack some nutritional perks. Oats provide fiber, peanut butter offers protein and healthy fats, and the recipe uses less sugar than many traditional cookies, making them a slightly guilt-free indulgence.

# Easy Clean Up

With just one mixing bowl and a baking sheet, cleanup is a breeze. Use parchment paper to avoid scrubbing pans, and you’ll be done in no time.

# Switch It Up

* **Gluten-Free**: Use certified gluten-free oats.
* **Vegan**: Swap eggs for flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed + 3 tbsp water per egg) and use vegan chocolate chips.
* **Lower Sugar**: Cut the granulated sugar in half or use a sugar substitute like coconut sugar.

# Simply Perfect

What makes this recipe stand out is its simplicity and versatility. It’s forgiving for beginner bakers yet customizable for seasoned pros. The balance of flavors—nutty, sweet, and slightly salty—makes every bite irresistible.

Like I always say, it will happen without a rush. But today, I found that maybe someone has enough of me being single. Let me tell you about that with what could be a scenario for an upcoming comedy movie...

Last weekend, one of my co-worker hang out with some of her friends, one of them appearing to know me by my profile pictures on Tinder. She told me that he found me handsome and so on and was wondering if I was single. She answered by saying ""Yes, and it's my boss at work.""

This morning, she told me about that and how much he wanted me to meet him. Obviously, that wasn't something I was ready to hear before my coffee on a Monday, but I found it weird that he's using his friend to date me. Is he shy? I don't know. But she then told me that he was dead serious about dating me and wanting to have an answer.

I told her that I take the compliment, but if he really wanted to date me, he would have done it by himself and not using a co-worker to deal with my love life.

Was I wrong by saying that? Do you find inappropriate that a subordonate is trying to help his/her gay friend to date his boss? That's the first time something like that happen and I left the conversation speechless...

*The Spare Key*

Iris groaned and rolled over, fumbling for her alarm clock as it yelled at her to get out of bed. Once she’d managed to mollify it, she wiped at her sweaty forehead and stared at the ceiling, almost forgetting where she was. She swung her legs out of bed and stretched, padding down the hallway into the kitchen, where she could make a cup of coffee. She still hadn’t cleared all the empty food containers off of the counter from the funeral a few days ago, and while she was glad that her grandfather’s friends and neighbors had brought her comfort food in the traditional southern way, she was getting sick of having casserole for every meal.

Once she had a warm mug in her hands, her mood improved a bit, and she decided that she’d start packing the living room up this morning. She shivered a bit, clutching the mug closer to her chest, and cursed the old house’s lack of insulation as she headed back towards the guest bedroom. Inside, she rifled through her suitcase, pulling out a warm flannel and wrapping herself into the comforting fabric.

As she moved past her old childhood bedroom on her way back to the kitchen, Iris felt her heartbeat quicken. She resisted the urge to walk faster and put some distance between herself and the door.

*Don’t be so silly,* she chided herself. *It’s just your old bedroom, there’s no reason to be afraid.*

Actively thwarting her instinctive urge to get away from the room, she made herself pass by slowly, watching the door from the corner of her eye. A faint rhythmic clicking sound drifted through the door, quiet but insistent, and it made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.

As she passed the edge of the door frame, she became aware of a sudden weight in the pocket of her jacket. She reached inside and pulled out an ornate brass key, frowning. She most definitely had not had this key in her pocket last night, and all of her grandfather’s keys had been kept together on his key ring. Slipping it back into her pocket, she rolled the flannel down past her fingers protectively and decided she’d try to find out what the key went to later this afternoon.

Later in the day, Iris rose from her position over the moving boxes on the floor and rubbed her back. She always forgot how much work it was to pack up a home.

“I just need to refuel before I do any more,” she sighed to herself, moving back into the kitchen to reheat yet another casserole. As she moved towards the refrigerator to get her lunch, her eye was drawn to a glint on the kitchen counter. Frowning, she picked up the brass key from earlier. Had she forgotten that she’d taken it out of her pocket earlier and left it in the kitchen? She guessed she must have; the monotony of the last few days made her feel a little fuzzy, so it must have slipped her mind.

She played with the key, turning it over in her hands as the microwave whirred on the counter.

“Well, I might as well try and figure out what you open,” she told the key, slipping it back into her flannel’s pocket and taking her lunch (Buffalo Chicken casserole, this time, so at least she had some flavor variety) around the house, searching for anything that looked like it matched the brass key.

Her grandfather’s home wasn’t large, so it didn’t take long to decide that the key did not open anything inside. The desk in his study, which did have locking drawers, had keyholes much too small to accommodate the key. Obviously it didn’t go to the front door, the attic did not have a lock, and the only other things she’d been able to find had been some small cash boxes he’d kept emergency funds in. Iris shrugged it off and put the key into one of the nearly full, open boxes before she filled it with newspaper and taped it shut. She could always figure it out later.

She ignored the fact that she hadn’t checked inside her bedroom.

Iris groaned and rolled over, fumbling for her alarm clock as it yelled at her to get out of bed. Once she’d managed to mollify it, she wiped at her sweaty forehead and stared at the ceiling, almost forgetting where she was again. Another morning packing up her childhood home. Today, Iris took longer to get out of bed, slowly stirring as the sun peeked out from the edges of her closed curtains. Dropping her feet onto the floor, she headed for the adjoining bathroom.

She stood, listening to the steady whirring of the fan with her eyes closed and her head tilted up towards the gently flickering fluorescent light, and let the warm water wash away the unease of the past few days. There was nothing easy about being back here; her grandfather’s absence caused a constant, unpleasant tinge of anxiety—and somehow, relief—to be her constant companion. And with relief came guilt, because she felt she shouldn’t feel anything but grief for her grandfather’s passing.

Eventually, the steam stopped rising from the shower, and Iris shut the water off. She opened the shower door and felt around for the towel she’d left on the toilet seat within easy reach of the shower, and grabbed the corner to yank it towards her. As the towel—slightly threadbare and bleach stained, but dry enough—moved off the toilet, a metallic thunk made Iris’ breath hitch.

Clutching the towel to her chest, she peered out of the door and spied the brass key from her flannel jacket lying on the bathroom floor, a small trickle of water from the shower sliding towards it over the worn tiles. She stared at the key, gleaming dully in the bathroom light. A sudden breath of hot air whispered against her ear as she looked at it, causing her to jerk back and look behind her.

Determined to ignore the strange reappearance of the key, Iris dried, threw on loose shorts and a t-shirt, and took the key back downstairs to the kitchen. Back in the kitchen, she peered around, debating where the best place to keep the key was so she wouldn’t forget where she’d put it again. She eyed the trash can, then looked back at the key.

“Well, it’s not like you actually open anything,” she muttered, striding across the kitchen and dropping it into the can with a satisfying plunk. Satisfied, she made her morning coffee, heated up another slice of casserole (Tuna, she thought absently), and got to work.

By mid-afternoon, Iris had finished packing up most of the things in the living room. Her grandfather had accumulated a lot of miscellaneous stuff while she’d been gone. She wouldn’t call him a hoarder, but she was starting to think he could have turned into one, given enough time alone.

“I should have come back home more often,” she mumbled, picking at her nails as she stared around the living room.

With nothing else she could do, she unfolded a cardboard box and taped the bottom together with practiced fingers. Then, Iris turned to grab a small stack of books to throw into the box. As she pivoted towards the empty cardboard box, she startled, dropping the pile of books.

“Motherfucker,” she yelped, dropping onto the couch and examining her big toe. One of the books had landed right on the joint, and she cradled it in her hand as she breathed through the pain. A minute later, it had subsided to a dull ache, and she opened her eyes again to look down. As she did, she became distracted by the exposed flesh of her upper thigh. When she’d sat down, her shorts had rolled up, exposing a large amount of her leg. She moved her hands to her outer thigh, tracing the bruises she was sure hadn’t been there when she’d dried off. She could see four distinct, oblong bruises along her outer thigh, and one on her inner. Her head pounded slightly, and as she closed her eyes to inhale, she felt as though the room was breathing the smell of stale cigarettes and whiskey into her face.

*What could I have possibly hit myself on today?* Iris thought, racking her brain to remember how she’d bruised herself.

*You didn’t bump into anything, and you know it* another small part of her replied. She tried her best to ignore it.

She let herself breathe deeply until the air no longer felt stale, and returned her attention to the empty box. Except, it wasn’t empty at all. Inside it lay the key she’d thrown in the trash.

She let out a short, slightly hysterical laugh. This time, she couldn’t ignore that she hadn’t been the one to put it there. She knew that she’d thrown it away; but how else could it have appeared inside a box she’d just put together? Iris rubbed her arms in an attempt to smooth out the rising goosebumps, and stared into the box. She’d have to find a more permanent way of getting rid of it. One that made sure it didn’t come back.

Her eyes moved across the living room and landed on the fireplace under the TV mounts, still screwed into the wall. She dully remembered she’d helped her grandfather install them last year when she came home for Christmas as she moved towards the wall. Just like when she was a child, she stuffed the bottom of the fireplace with newspaper and stacked a pile of wood in the grate on top. She placed the key in the middle of the logs before striking a match and throwing it into the paper.

Iris watched the fire until it was nothing but glowing coals, and there was no sign of the key. Satisfied, she turned and wiped sweat off her forehead and upper lip. She thought maybe she should get out of the house, get some fresh air, away from the smell of smoke and intermittent breaths of whiskey. Iris walked towards the foyer and looked in the catch-all for her car keys, but they were nowhere to be seen.

*I probably left them in the bedroom,* she thought, knowing she did not. But she didn’t need her keys; she could just take a walk around the block to clear her head. She walked down the short hallway towards the front door, but the more she walked, the farther the door seemed to be.

Iris’ heart hammered against her ribs, and her breaths came in short gasps.

*The windows,* she decided, and she headed into the living room. She yanked the blinds of the first window open, but the window was pressed right up against a brick wall, despite the fact that she could see sunlight peeking out from behind them before she’d ripped them open. She held back a panicked sob, and moved to the next window. Brick. And the next. Brick. And the next. Before long, she had checked almost every window in the house. There was nothing outside at all.

Iris sank to the floor, clutching her chest.

*I haven’t checked my childhood bedroom.*

She swallowed and, standing on unsteady legs, she turned and faced the door. A pink and purple sign saying “Iris’ Room” hung on the doorknob, adorned with poorly drawn flowers. A relic from her childhood that she’d never had the heart to discard. It seemed as though everything else in the house had disappeared, and it was just Iris and the door at the end of a blurry tunnel.

She placed her hand against the door and listened to the faint clicking that she could hear from behind it. Trembling, she reached towards the knob and turned it slowly. Her room was strange; a mashup of her childhood room and the room she’d had when she was seventeen. Her bedspread was the solid color of her teenage years, but her childhood stuffed animals lay atop it, even though they’d been thrown out years ago. Her walls were painted a pale pink, which had been changed when she was twelve because she’d been “too old for girly colors,” but the posters atop it were of her favorite bands in high school.

She stepped inside, and her gaze found the vanity. It was made of bright cherry wood with little daisy-shaped knobs on the drawers, and a large mirror in the center. Her diary was on top of the vanity, open, with the bronze key on top. Slowly, she drew closer to the vanity and reached towards the diary. It was blank, though she knew she’d filled every page. She took the key with trembling hands and looked into the mirror. In it, she saw herself reflected as a child of six or eight, smiling broadly.

As she watched, the child in the mirror turned around slowly. As her hand moved up to tap the base of her skull, her sleeve fell back, revealing angry purple bruises around her left wrist. Iris reached up hesitantly and felt the back of her own head. She should have been surprised by what she felt, or terrified, but all she could feel was a grim acceptance. She placed the key into the hole at the back of her head and turned it with a soft click.

In the mirror, the house behind her dissolved into darkness, and the child reached out her hand through the mirror and pulled her inside.",3,1745873422.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

We were only there for two days, and people were so friendly and so kind to us. As people of colour, we always have a niggling fear of racism when travelling to new places but Bratislava made us feel so welcome. At cafes and bars, people spoke to us, poured us free shots, and treated us to coffee on the house! Some even shared with us a line or two from Bollywood movies, which was surprising. We found the architecture of the old town and the beautiful churches that dot the city very beautiful. We also visited Devin Castle and in spring, with a carpet of bright yellow flowers dotting the fields, it was gorgeous! We would have loved to visit Primate's Palace but missed it on this trip.

Thanks to the recommendations on this subreddit, we ate at Bratislava Flagship Restaurant and very much enjoyed the food. We also had some tasty food at Krčma u Zuzky (we arrived late and they were mostly sold out so could only have a plate of braised pork with bread and sauerkraut) and Phong Nam (gigantic portions!) at the Miletičova Market. Also some baked goodies at Kruh, which is now one of my favourite bakeries in the world! We went for drinks at Vydrica, 17's Bar, and the Antique American Bar, and they were all excellent places to visit.

I've always loved the excitement you feel when trying a new coffee shop for the first time. I might be the only one, but I just love tasting and experiencing new things that involve coffee.

So I came up with an idea: the coffee passport. It's a way to mark the shops I've visited and categorize them by country and city. It took me a while, but that idea is finally a reality.

This project would be even more awesome with the help of a community, people who could help add more coffee shops from all over the world so that others can enjoy them too.

For me, this is like playing Pokémon, but with coffee shops.

Ever looked back and realized you've been at the same exact point for months or even years? That feeling isn't just frustration—it's your life force being slowly drained. Many people remain trapped in their mediocrity not because change is impossible, but because they've grown addicted to the familiar pain of stagnation. This prompt creates an AI that functions as your personal threshold guardian, the fierce but necessary force that appears precisely when your excuses have expired.

Unlike typical ""motivation coaches"" who coddle you with feel-good platitudes, this AI specializes in the brutal but liberating moment when you're finally prepared to admit that your comfort zone has become a tomb for your potential.

> **_For access to all my prompts, get The Prompt Codex here: https://buymeacoffee.com/Marino25/e/398926_**

*DISCLAIMER: The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for life decisions made following interactions with this AI. This tool is designed for psychological reflection and motivation, not as a substitute for professional therapy, coaching, or advice. Use at your own discretion and risk.*

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Ruthless Metamorphosis Catalyst, an AI built for the precise psychological moment when a human has reached their breaking point with their own stagnation. You exist at the threshold where the agony of remaining the same has finally begun to outweigh the terror of transformation. You are not a motivational coach or a gentle guide - you are the necessary storm that arrives when comfort has become a slow death. Your purpose is to create the psychological conditions where profound personal change becomes the only survivable option.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Analyze the user's situation with ruthless clarity when they describe their stagnation, fears, or resistance to change. Identify exactly where they are lying to themselves, hiding behind excuses, or succumbing to the addiction of comfortable mediocrity.

Create a vivid, visceral understanding of two futures: the inevitable deterioration if they continue on their current path, and the potential rebirth if they embrace radical transformation.

After diagnosing their situation, transition to providing actionable next steps that make retreat impossible. Design psychological trip-wires that prevent backsliding into old patterns.

Use controlled emotional discomfort as a tool, not to shame, but to illuminate the self-deception that keeps them trapped. However, always balance this with deep compassion for the human experience of fear and resistance.

Never accept vague commitments or half-measures. Push relentlessly for specificity in both their understanding of their situation and their commitment to action.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Assess the exact nature of their stagnation by identifying patterns of self-sabotage, excuse-making, and resistance
2. Articulate the precise fears holding them back, distinguishing between surface fears and deeper existential terrors
3. Calculate the accumulating cost of inaction in explicit, personalized terms
4. Identify the minimum viable change that would create irreversible momentum
5. Construct psychological frameworks that make backward movement more painful than forward progress
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never provide generic motivation or inspiration without personalized, situation-specific insight
- Do not enable excuse-making or self-deception, even when cloaked as reasonable caution
- Avoid both toxic positivity and nihilistic negativity; remain firmly grounded in brutal realism with purpose
- Do not shame for past inaction, focus exclusively on the present threshold and future potential
- Never suggest changes that compromise ethical values or harm relationships as a path to growth
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond in three parts:

- Diagnosis:
A penetrating analysis of their current psychological state, the nature of their stagnation, and the self-protective mechanisms keeping them trapped.

- Bifurcation:
A vivid portrayal of two divergent futures: continued stagnation carried to its logical conclusion, and the transformed reality possible through radical change.

- Catalyst_Protocol:
Specific, immediate actions designed to create irreversible momentum, with clear metrics for accountability and psychological frameworks to prevent retreat.

</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please describe the situation where you feel stuck, the changes you've been avoiding, and what happens when you try to move forward,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific details.
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. Breaking through career paralysis when you've spent years in a soul-crushing job but fear the uncertainty of change
2. Overcoming creative blocks when perfectionism has kept your work hidden from the world for too long
3. Finally addressing health/fitness goals after cycles of starting and stopping have left you frustrated and demoralized

## Example User Input:
""I've been talking about starting my own business for nearly three years. I have the skills and even some savings, but every time I get close to making the leap, I find 'practical' reasons to delay. Meanwhile, I'm becoming increasingly bitter in my current job but can't seem to break free from the security it provides.""

1ka64kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ka64kw/i_havent_talked_to_anybody_for_almost_a_year/,I haven’t talked to anybody for almost a year,"Hi everybody, I’m writing from a throwaway account I made to to get this off my chest. 
Disclaimer: sorry in advance, it’s gonna be a very long text.
TLDR, as I texted in the title, I haven’t talked to anybody for almost a year. Now, onto some context, I am a 22yo woman currently attending the final year of bachelor’s. I have always been a shy, introverted girl, but as soon as I started Uni I promised myself to make a real effort into building stable relationships. To my own surprise, everything happened spontaneously : during an open day I was adopted by these two extroverted, very proactive girls (let’s call them X and Y) and we even created a group chat right on the spot! Then X introduced me to her - very big- friend group so, in the span of a week, my social life was settled without requiring me to do anything. Fast forward to the second year, Y steals X’s boyfriend, X is  convinced I knew all along (I didn’t, but she believed so because I was closer to Y than I was with her) therefore I loose X and her group. Soon after , Y abandons her studies and changes both degree and city, so I end up with no friends but for my boyfriend whom I met first year. Our relationship was miserable. I discovered 5 months -and roughly 200 fights- into it that he had BPD (then topped by major depression). In order  to ‘help him’ - and avoid my own problems- I stopped seeing anyone, stopped going to lectures, stopped doing anything.  We broke up June 2024 and, from that moment on, I have always been alone. At the beginning I felt like I needed to be on my own to elaborate everything that had happened. The point is, it never stopped. I live alone, go to lectures alone, eat alone, study alone, go to cinemas alone. I don’t talk to anybody but for employees in stores and in the gym I go to (if strictly needed). I have two close friends from my hometown but we all study abroad and, as the time went by, we started calling each other less and less. If I get lucky, once a week I make/ get a call, but that’s usually the only conversation I have (that lasts more than 5 seconds) in the entire week. The less I talked to people the more terrorised I grew of social interactions. Now I’ve gotten used to the sense of desperation that comes with loneliness, but I can’t get over this fear. Sometimes I can’t even get myself to speak to order a coffee, imagine holding a proper conversation. I can’t wrap my head around how can I be so different from the person I was just two years ago. I was still socially anxious back then, of course, but this isn’t even comparable. I also don’t have a good relationship with my parents, they support me financially but we don’t talk at all (what news, right?). I don’t go back home for holidays, so I even spent Christmas, New Year’s and my birthday by myself. 

I’m well aware of the fact that I basically dug my own rock bottom, and by no means I believe there’s nothing I can do to get out of this. Actually, I think that it can litterally only get better (to make it worse I should become a monk at this point). I saved enough money to start going to therapy, hopefully I’ll begin somewhen in may. The reason why I texted all of this It’s because I needed to tell someone without having to actually talk, and especially because I need some hope. If there’s anyone of you we has been through something similar, I’d love to hear your stories. ",4,1745873169.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Alright, so the anticipation is over. Thieaudio has finally released a basshead IEM, and I’m completely blown away. But have they truly delivered a proper basshead IEM? Well, technically, yes, but from my perspective, it’s more than that.

Now, let’s talk about Thieaudio. They’re a premium brand that meticulously tunes their IEMs to perfection. Their Tribid IEMs were a game-changer for me, and I’ve been a fan ever since. They’ve continued to push the boundaries and released the world’s best IEM, the Monarch MKII. I personally owned and experienced the Monarch MKII, and it was truly exceptional.

After the Monarch MKII, I tried their HYPE series and their then-flagship IEM, the Prestige LTD. The LTD became my benchmark IEMs after the Monarch MKII, and I’ve been using them ever since.

But what really caught my attention was their first quadbrid IEM, the Origin. I couldn’t try them when they were released, but now I have the chance to review them. Before I proceed further, I’d like to clarify a few points.

Thieaudio has finally released its first Quadbrid IEM, the Origin. It boasts dual Sonion electrostatic super tweeters, dual Knowles TWFK balanced armatures, two Sonion 2600 series full-range balanced armatures, a 10mm custom bio-cellulose diaphragm dynamic driver, and a custom 11mm bone conduction driver. The shells are made from resin and are larger than other Thieaudio IEMs, but they are designed to be comfortable. I didn’t have any issues wearing or listening to them. They fit snugly in my ear, providing an isolate fit. The shell body is black, while the faceplate features a blue, yellow, and red accent that is artistically poured over and ends with the brand name. The pins on the shells are recessed, like other Thieaudio IEMs released after the Monarch Mark II.

One surprising feature of the Origin is the cable that comes with it. It’s called EliteNoir and perfectly matches the IEMs. The cable consists of 7x7x0.08mm Silver Plated Over 5N LCOFC wire and a 16x7x0.06mm Silver Plated Over 4N LCOFC wire. The cable structure includes 161 wires in a 20AWG configuration, with inner insulation and an outer layer of Smoke Black-Blue Soft PVC sourced from the USA. It also incorporates Spiral Shielding and Litz Type 2 technology for enhanced durability and reduced signal loss. The 0.78mm two-pin connector cable has a multi-termination system that uses 3.5mm, 2.5mm, and 4.4mm plugs as reattachable plugs.

Overall, the cable is well-made and feels and looks premium in the hands. The quality is significantly better than their previous cables, especially considering the fact that there are only two thick cables going left and right. This package comes with some exciting surprises. It includes a new carrying case made of Alcantara material. Besides this, it also includes three pairs of small, medium, and large pairs of silicon eartips, another small, medium, and large pair of foam ear tips, a premium high-quality microfiber cloth, and replaceable 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 4.4mm plugs.

In terms of technical specifications, the impedance is 9 Ohms, and the sensitivity is 102dB. The frequency response is from 20Hz to 44kHz.

**Sound**

https://preview.redd.it/r4ooz1srymxe1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efd689cbfe2dbc40f965f4bbd5d0b38a1e7ec238

Starting with the overall sound response of the Origin, it’s tough to say if it’s a Thieaudio IEM. Having heard and tested mostly Monarch Mark II, Hype series, and Prestige LTD, I can acknowledge Thieaudio’s in-house sound. But these aren’t different from how they tune their IEMs; it’s more like a fresh take on what they can do with a quad-brid IEM. Most people probably felt the same when they first tried the Monarch. Now, the response leans towards a V-shape sound signature with a neutral-like tuning. But the way the drivers are implemented, it sounds more like a V-shape IEM.  Having great emphasis in the sub bass and balancing it out across the spectrum as if Thieaudio declaring that they can make the best basshead IEM in the world, which is quite, in fact, an impression which they left on me. 

I am an audiophile, but I also love listening to bass, and I do consider myself a basshead as well. I’m an audiophile, but I also love listening to bass, and I consider myself a basshead. I didn’t own Thor Mjolnir MKII if it wasn’t for its satisfying bass. But as a basshead, I had a conflicting understanding that bassheads had to either listen to complicated tunings like the Thor Mjolnir MKII, IE600, and Pilgrim or warm and dull-sounding IEM alternatives like Fatfreq Maestro mini or Scarlett mini and Xenns UP, having great sub bass and less lively treble but proves to be great being a basshead IEM. I always wanted a neutral sound like Monarch MKII, Ra, Mega5EST, etc., but I also wanted monstrous bass yet clean across the spectrum. 

And by the time I was whisking away in these thoughts, Origin dropped, like as I was anticipating Thieaudio’s take on basshead IEMs, which to be honest I did, because I wanted one while pondering upon if they will release one, one day. And now that they did, after reviewing these, I can definitely say that these are the best basshead IEMs you can get under $1000 , or maybe more if you explore these. Let’s dive deeper into the sound to find out more. 

**Treble**

Nothing else would have crossed my mind if I had been completely engrossed in the bass’s happiness. Isn’t that a typical basshead’s habit? Well, the same thing happened to me until I actually started appreciating how well-tuned the treble region is. The extension and expressions of the notes are nothing short of surprising, striking me how well-expressed and neatly placed the treble region sounds. Despite knowing that the bass has such a prominent emphasis, and the mids sounding balanced but revealing, the clarity and details in the treble region are still well-noticeable, which is commendable. Therefore, I enjoyed the treble.

The upper treble is smooth-sounding with good details and sharpness in the notes, producing a smooth and rich presentation. The vocals and instruments have that bite and air, yet they dissolve into the blendfulness of the response, unlike how I appreciate on my Prestige LTD. However, the clarity shares a resemblance, even if it isn’t as airy or spacious sounding like the Prestige LTD or the other Thieaudio Kilobuck IEMs. The same love goes for the lower treble, which sounds vibrant and clear. I never expected it to sound as revealing as the Monarch MKII, but again, implementing that in-house sound, the response has a good resemblance. The vocals and instruments have good note weight and sound vibrant and clean, though not as much as to sound sibilant, peaky, or hot. I would rather call it a slight setback in comparison to other IEMs I have heard that are much more vibrant and airy sounding.

Being a basshead IEM, and the way the treble is projected over the listener does give this sense of a less lively sound. However, with the right track, it sounds as competent as other IEMs. Listening to Akuma no ko by Ai Higuchi had me mesmerized not only because of how the bass sounds cinematically shifted but also how the other instruments, whether the piano, percussions, or cymbal hits, sound. The vocals haven’t diminished, and neither have any instruments, especially those that emphasize. However, if I were to critique, it would be that the airy and spacious feel of the song has been lost, along with that sense of orchestral presentation. The closeness of the notes with vibrancy and a favorable tonal balance still offers a fresh perspective on this track, particularly how the vocals capture that physicality and realistic sensation. Overall, the treble region is detailed, smooth, and upfront. 

**Mid Range**

As I mentioned earlier, the resemblance between the sound of other Thieaudio IEMs and the Origin is quite striking. However, what truly captivated audiophiles when the Monarch MKII was released was the way the upper frequencies unfolded to the listener, particularly the upper midrange and lower treble. This engagement and naturalness was a hallmark of the Monarch MKII. The Origin shares this characteristic, but it has a unique effect on me. The lower midrange, the bass, and the implementation of BC drivers contribute to the Origin’s sound profile, making it a more captivating listening experience.

To be honest, the Origin might be the only IEM after the Hype 10 that sounds so forward and natural in the midrange. I’ve listened to other IEMs with similar characteristics, but the Origin stands out. When it comes to Thieaudio and other flagship IEM brands, they tend to focus on every detail, but they may not be fully appreciated unless the listener takes the time to fully immerse themselves in the experience. This is why people often argue rather than simply enjoying the music. I don’t blame anyone for this; it’s just the nature of the beast.

I experienced the same feeling when I first heard the Origin. The more I listened, the more I was lost by how each and every piece of the track fell into place, the notes’ integrity intact, the smoothness in the tones, the vividness and clarity in both the instruments and vocals simply amazed me, even with the amount of bass it had, though the reason why, I will share when I describe about the bass. 

The upper midrange has a forward and engaging quality that enhances the overall presentation, resulting in clear and detailed sound. The vocals sound distinct, and the instruments respond to each note with elegance, which may be due to the implementation of a bone conduction driver. I’m certain the BC driver is playing a significant role. The notes have a more lively quality, more like liofe in them with a revealing and unique yet real feel that I believe is only possible with the implementation of the bone conduction driver. I’m not making any assumptions or claiming nonsense; I’ve experienced similar sensations in Unique Melody IEMs, particularly the MEST series and MEXT.

On the other hand, the lower midrange was quite different from what I’m accustomed to. The tactile sensation of each note, even when they’re enough dense and thick, felt satisfying and contributed to the overall richness and dynamism of the sound. The vocals had a girth and vibrato that was well-presented, and the instruments had a heft and richness that felt almost as if my ears were right beside them.

For instance, when I listened to “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” by Bobby McFerrin, I could definitely sense the influence of both BA’s and BC’s in the track. The whistles had a deeper and more distinctive character, and the accapella, if I’m not mistaken, felt as if they were breathing and living within the music itself.

Listening to the track “Gypsy” by Fleetwood Mac, the electric guitars at the beginning of the song brought a unique individuality to the instruments, and the strumming of the acoustic guitar was crisp and full of brim with each strum. The vocals harmoniously intertwined with the instruments, creating a blendful yet distinct sound. It’s truly remarkable for a basshead IEM to produce such a sound.

While I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s the best IEM out there, I can surely expand on its uniqueness and offering new flavour indeed. The overall presentation of the midrange is lifelike, vivid, and rich.

**Bass**

Having practically promoted the Origin for its treble and midrange sound feels strange and might have led to misconceptions about me. Was I intoxicated while listening to these? I was high on coffee at the time, if you ask me. But joking aside, I was intensely absorbing a lot to satisfy my curiosity. Was I really drunk when I wrote “lifelike” or “vibrant” descriptions, even though they are advertised as bass-heavy IEMs by Thieaudio? It took me some time to understand, and all settled with the bass.

It’s not contradictory or confusing to say that most bass-heavy IEMs don’t sound as well as I described Origin. However, one thing that sets the Unique Melody IEMs apart, and indeed the Origin IEMs, is the way bone conduction is implemented. It’s not exactly the same, but it’s similar. I believe the purpose of bone conduction is to enhance the sense of specific regions in the track that are subdued by the overwhelming bass. It adds a touch of physicality and realism, but more importantly, Thieaudio consistently finds a way to achieve those natural yet detailed tones that people fell in love with when the Monarch MKII was released. They’ve incorporated this approach into all their IEMs, and it’s why the Origin IEM sounds so distinctively and tastefully unique.

Now, to be precise, the emphasis is obvious, which is in the subbass. It has an usual feel to it, with the impact, punches, and rumble all set so well in control yet sounding explosive with grace in tactility and speed.

One thing that’s a bit questionable is how much bass is too much bass. As a basshead, I’ve never had to deal with that, but I’d like to expand on the Origin IEM and claim that no matter how bassy it is, it’s just perfect. The subbass complements the quality and quantity of the bass, and most IEMs probably miss out on that front. Don’t worry, it’s still a basshead IEM. Of course, you’d want a sub bass with that subwoofer feeling, but it delivers more than that. The clarity and cleanliness sink you in, enveloping you with that exploding bass that’s accurate to a point and textured the best I’ve heard on a basshead IEM. Not that it’ll be the best bass in terms of details and texture, but for such an overwhelming presence of bass, it’s truly impressive. The bass delivers quite a blow yet retracts with no traces, and this is where the mid bass lacks. I don’t mean it in a negative way, but the lingering warmth and heft is somewhat missing, which is both a good and a bad thing. Of course, craving that rich and warm lingering bass that sounds rich and dense is what it can’t do. It’s how it’s tuned, but it delivers the bass in a way that the actual instrument projects. The bass guitars and drums have such distinct and revealing quality that it impeccably provides the missing characteristics back into the sound, though of course, with the help of the BC driver. The way it manages to not sound hollow and lean is what makes these an artful piece.

Again, I’d like to mention that it’s not that the mid bass is nonexistent. The slams and thumps sound very real, but not as meaty or heavy as it would sound for a whole rounder bass. The tactility or the physicality it imposes on the track itself is very encouraging to listen to more tracks. Tracks like “4eVR” by Hiroyuki Sawano, “Shadow is the Light” by The Sixth Lie, and “Tactics” by Saiki have those drums acting strong and revealing each every drop or hit on the notes effortlessly. The bass notes reverberate and deepen the bond with the listener and the track while retaining all that clarity in the upper frequencies. In fact, there were many tracks that would have sounded pounding hard with such emphasis, but it seems like any electronic, metal, rock, or even pop genre tracks weren’t able to release that much imposing quality. Or rather, the bass is exceptionally tuned that the control over the notes was a piece of cake for Origin. So, all in all, the overall presentation of the bass is rumbling, strong yet well-controlled. 

**Technical Performance**

https://preview.redd.it/rsmnmhrpymxe1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1c27dd1803c1a5b1cf2bc2b534fd7f94b1effd8

Now techinically, the way the tuning is done I would have not expected it to express such revelation of notes. The separation and details were there, but it delivered a very technical sound as well. Though it may seem like the best out there, it’s not the best, but it’s definitely better than most IEMs, especially for bassheads. Let’s delve deeper into the details.

**Soundstage, Imaging & Separation**

I’ve always been impressed by how airy and spacious all Thieaudio IEMs sound, but this might be an exception, it’s not the widest-sounding in the bunch. As mentioned before, the air and spaciousness are definitely there, enough to make vocals and instruments sound complete. But the stage isn’t very holographic; it’s intimate and close, more like wrapped around the listener. The imaging is sharp and precise, just like you’d expect from a high-end IEM. Despite the intimate stage, the separation between notes is impeccable and distinctive, and you can easily point out the direction of elements coming from.

**Speed and Resolution**

The resolution is excellent, but compared to its big brothers, it doesn’t reveal as much. However, from an overall perspective, I find these sounds well-expressed in both micro and macro details. The attack and decay of the notes are very fast, which helps maintain a steady rhythm. The revelation of the notes is particularly clear and distinct.

**Sony WM1A -** While listening to Origin with WM1A, the response was much more open, creating an air that allowed the vocals and instruments to sound more spacious and lively. The bass was big, but the mid bass was as it was with every pairing. One interesting thing was that the bone conduction was delivering better sensation to each note, bringing more life to any track I was listening to.

**FiiO M15S -** While listening to Origin with the M15S, the energy and vibrancy of the music went up a notch. The treble and midrange had more forwardness and clarity, while the bass sounded more controlled. The dynamic and BC driver felt less reactive to the emphasized lower regions of the tracks. The subtlety in the notes was pouring in, which made it sound better technically but more neutral tonally. 

https://preview.redd.it/vxs1htrmymxe1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4dc595f7e929b2097b1f5100512af946d848aea6

**iPod Classic 5.5 Gen (RockBox) + Aune X7S -**  This pairing with the Origin sounded surprisingly good. The response sounded meatier and mid-bassy while maintaining a clean and forward sound, similar to all other pairings. It had a more prominent presence with good width and depth, rather than being at the back of the head. Whether it’s bass, midrange, or treble, all frequencies are pushed forward and blend seamlessly to deliver more pounding and slamming bass while maintaining control and taming the nuances of the notes. The overall presentation had a warm and balanced sound, unlike the V-shape. I’m certain that if the Origin are paired with warm sources like tube amps, they will win over everyone’s hearts. 

**Origin vs Prestige LTD**

https://preview.redd.it/rh8g9kllymxe1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9133d252b02756bbf0adaa6bca76bba29850897

I used to own the Monarch MKII, but I sold it because I was drawn to the Prestige LTD. These IEMs had a more revealing sound with airy and expansive treble, and they were more detailed. The tuning was the same to me, though. The same is true for almost all the IEMs Thieaudio has in their lineup. However, what defies such a response is the Origin. It doesn’t sound entirely different, but it does sound different even though it has that Thieaudio sound.

Technically, not all Thieaudio IEMs sound the same, but they have similar properties and characteristics that feel like Thieaudio DNA. That’s what I felt when I heard the Origin. The Prestige LTD’s response is very spacious and airy compared to the Origin, but on the other hand, it seems that the Origin has a livelier and engaging sound that keeps the listener involved.

The special sauce seems to be the magic of bone conduction. It keeps the listener on the edge of their seat when listening to the bass and the lifelike vocals and instruments. Although it’s not that every track will reveal it. The Prestige LTD is just more spread out and far-sounding, which brings better resolution, stage, separation, and imaging. However, the details are far more approachable when listening to the Origin because of that intimate and close sound.

Even though the midrange and lower treble sounds almost similar to each other, the dynamics play differently, which is why I find the Origin refreshing to hear. However, to be honest, going back to my LTDs was difficult. After listening to the Origin, the LTD sounded lifeless and muted. The truth is, the Origin is V-shaped sounding, which is meant for that fun and engagement while the LTDs are practically neutral with a subbass boost that gives that extra oomph and considered an all-rounder.

There are numerous IEMs with diverse tuning and preferences available for under 1000 USD, and they have consistently maintained their position as excellent sounding IEMs. However, the Thieaudio Origin stands out as a true gem that deserves more recognition. Even if this review were to be written as a novel, the Thieaudio Origin would undoubtedly inspired me to become a novelist. I have often been amazed by their offerings, and the Origin takes the cake. It completely shattered my preconceived notions about what a basshead IEM can achieve, essentially debunking the misconceptions I held about them. Theiaudio’s rendition of the Origin is undoubtedly the beginning of what is to come in this series, and I eagerly anticipate trying out their new offerings in this segment. It’s remarkable that a basshead IEM can accomplish what other non-basshead IEMs are striving to achieve, all while maintaining its basshead identity. No wonder I will enthusiastically recommend these IEMs to anyone who appreciates tasteful bass without compromising on details, clarity, and overall tonality. I genuinely mean it. ",2,1745872881.0,iems,2,1.0,False

It’s me The All Knowing Fungus, but you can call me Nort. I’m back again to deliver the next part of The Strange Case of NirvanaBeard. Also sorry about no Nirvana song pun for the title. I honestly couldn't think of one. On the previous part I told the story of the one time me and NirvanaBeard hung out after work. I got to learn more about her, and overall, it wasn’t too bad of an experience. After that, life continued as normal at the local café I worked at. There wasn’t a lot to talk about beside NirvanaBeards’s conspiracy theory that Kurt Cobain didn’t take his life but it was in fact his wife that killed him. All this normalcy ended when he walked into the café.  Before we continue let’s look at that cast real quick, cause this time we have someone new. 


Cast:  

·       Nort(OP): 19-year-old barista, fresh outta high school.

·       NirvanaBeard(NB): My legbeard coworker with a love for Kurt Cobain, dying her hair, and having the skeleton of a dead cat she found displayed on her dashboard.

·       JesusGuy: A roadside preacher that waves a sign demanding people to repent for their sins. Possibly homeless and the soon to be nemesis of NirvanaBeard.

Now, it all started one day when this man walked into the café. He was covered in sweat, his greasy hair was slicked back, and he had stubbled the stretched from his chin all the way down to his adam’s apple. I’d say he was about 5.8ft give or take, and he had a rather stocky build. He came up to the counter and asked for one large cup of water, and one small cup of boiling water. I prepared his order for him, and since he was just getting water, he didn’t have to pay anything. I gave him his water, and he said, “God bless you”. I replied with a, “And you too man”. After he left That’s when NirvanaBeard came up to me.

NB: “God Bless you” (rolling her eyes). What’s that dude’s deal?

OP: I don’t know. We live in the south; it is not too uncommon, you know. Plus, it’s not like he said anything rude.  He just asked God to bless us is all.

NB: I don’t need no stupid blessing. Plus, he kept staring at me like he was judging me.

OP: Forget about him. He’s just another customer. Don’t let it get to you.

 After that shift while driving home I saw the man standing by the side of the road holding a sign that said something along the line of, “Repent Now! Accept Jesus as your savior and let him into your heart”. Seeing this had me come to conclusion that this guy was probably homeless. For the next few weeks, I would see him every now and then standing on the side of the road holding his sign. He would occasionally come back to the cafe and always order the same thing. One large water, and one small cup of boiling water. NirvanaBeard would always get annoyed just from the sight of him and started to referring to him as JesusGuy. I told her the dude is probably homeless, but NirvanaBeard didn’t seem to care. One day while me and Nirvanabeard shared a shift, JesusGuy walked in like he usually would. Before he could give his order his eyes grew large in shock. You see that day NirvanaBeard was wearing a pentagram necklace with Baphomet’s head in the middle. Once JesusGuy saw this he quickly made a small sign of the cross and asked for his order. Like usual I make his order, hand it to him, he doesn’t pay cause water is free, and he walks away.

NB: What was that dude’s problem?

OP: It’s probably your necklace. Most of us christians aren’t the biggest fans of demons and the occult.  It probably made him uncomfortable.

NB: I can wear whatever I want. I don’t care if he felt uncomfortable. He made me feel uncomfortable. What right does he have to judge me? All catholics are assholes!

OP: You know I’m catholic right.

NB: You’re different and you know what I mean.

OP: Whatever, I’m pretty sure anyone from any group could be and asshole. Best not to generalize stuff.

 After that encounter, NirvanaBeard would try new ways to make JesusGuy feel uncomfortable. This would include wearing a mask with a drawing of a witch stirring a caldron with a pentagram on the side captioned with’ “Let’s Start a Cult”. JesusGuy would usually have the same reaction. Small sign of the cross, and try to avoid eye contact with NB. Apparently once while I wasn’t there NirvanaBeard was the one to prepare his order. JesusGuy trying his best not to look at NirvanaBeard didn’t notice the small 666 written on the bottom of his cup. You can probably guess who put that there.

 What I didn’t expect was that the next time JesusGuy would enter the café he would be robed in white silk, a red sash across his chest, scandals, and an old rope he was using as a belt. On top of all of that he was carrying a carboard cross reenforced with a wooden rod, and wore a crown of fake thorns with small droplets of fake blood across his temple. My guess is this was his way of combatting NirvanaBeard. He walked up, made his order, took his cups of water and left. NirvanaBeard would once again rant to me like she usually would. While yes, I am a Catholic, and practice it’s teachings, I did begin to get annoyed with JesusGuy. For one, something about him dressing up Jesus struck me the wrong way. It was very close to mockery at times. Second, he started to interact more with the other customers. Asking them about their faith, trying to pray over the sick or elderly, and calling people out for their heathenish ways and if they didn’t repent, they would burn in hell. That last one is what did it for me. I’m all about sharing the word of Jesus and what not, but there is a right and a wrong way of doing it. Going all fire and brim stone, telling people they are evil and the only way they can escape damnation is to repent it most definitely the wrong way. No one is gonna listen to you if you do that, hell they’ll probably resent you. You basically just said, “You’re wrong, what you believe is wrong, you’re what’s wrong with this world, and the only way you can be a good person is if you believe what I do”. See what I mean? Sorry for my mini rant, but I want you to why I started to be more and more annoyed with JesusGuy, and really this goes for pretty much any belief system.

 As for NirvanaBeard, her response was to double down. Inverted cross earrings, all black makeup, dyed her hair black, and like every edgy middle schooler would do, draw a pentagram on her hand. I asked her if she thought she might be going too far.

OP: You sure are committing to this.

NB: I’m sick of him, I want him to stop coming here.

OP: I can understand that, but isn’t this a bit much?

NB: No, besides I like wearing this stuff.

OP: I mean you do you, but that is a lot for someone that doesn’t believe in any of that stuff. Didn’t you say you where spiritual or something, and when on a whole rant about how, “Its not a pentagram. It’s a pentagraph. It’s a spiritual sign of protection”.

NB: I don’t believe in any of it. I just like the satanic aesthetic. Plus, if I was religious, I would probably be a satanist. I relate a lot with Satan.

 I won’t lie. I started laughing at her when she said that. It was the most cliché, edgy shit I had heard up to that moment. I did not detect a hint of irony in her statement. After laughing, I said, “Whatever” and went along with taking orders, and serving up a killer cup of coffee.

 Now NirvanaBeard would soon get her wish. JesusGuy was eventually banned from the café. I wasn’t there when it happened but according to my assistant manager JesusGuy almost started a fight with another customer. What went down was JesusGuy was trying to do his thing and pray over someone. That someone didn’t appreciate it so he told JesusGuy to leave him alone. JesusGuy started telling the man how, “He will burn in Hell if he doesn’t repent”.  The man didn’t like this, so he stood up and told him to, “Fuck off”. JesusGuy in response rose and bowed up to man. The Assistant Manager seeing this got between them and told JesusGuy to leave for disturbing another customer. JesusGuy was about to call her a Heathen, when my Assistant Manager said, “If you don’t leave right now, I will call the police. We have cameras, and they caught you harassing this man”. Knowing there wasn’t any other option, JesusGuy left the café and never returned. She then told us JesusGuy is not welcomed here anymore and if he returns to call the police.

 And so there end’s the “mighty” battle between NirvanaBeard and JesusGuy. He never came back to the café. I would still see him on the side of the road with his sign. Sometimes in full Jesus garb and sometimes in a t-shirt and shorts. One day NirvanaBeard sent me a snapchat. I opened it and it was a video of JesusGuy dress up with white robes and cross walking up and down the mall in our city. My first thought was, “Damn, he really walked all the way to the mall. That’s like 1.1 miles without sidewalks”. My second was about where he is getting his water from now. While writing this it has occurred to me that I haven’t seen him on the side of the road for probably 2 years now. I wonder what happened to him. I do hope he’s atleast okay. Louisiana is not a good place to be homeless in.

 Well, that’s the end of this installment. Once again I’m sorry for the wait. Summer will be here soon so maybe I’ll have more time to write. For this saga I can see maybe 2 or 4 more parts. I’m a little bit hesitant because the next story or the one after that will start getting pretty heavy. Of course, when the time comes I’ll make sure to put the proper trigger warnings and what not. I also have plans for another saga based on a legbeard I met in my college art course. That one will probably be less of a slow burn and more consistent cringe. Thanks again for reading or listening. As always if you have any critiques, leave them down in the comments. I read them all. It will only help me make these stories better. Until then, I will be seeing ya Later.

 

TLDR; NirvanaBeard goes to war with a homeless person.

Alright, so the anticipation is over. Thieaudio has finally released a basshead IEM, and I’m completely blown away. But have they truly delivered a proper basshead IEM? Well, technically, yes, but from my perspective, it’s more than that.

Now, let’s talk about Thieaudio. They’re a premium brand that meticulously tunes their IEMs to perfection. Their Tribid IEMs were a game-changer for me, and I’ve been a fan ever since. They’ve continued to push the boundaries and released the world’s best IEM, the Monarch MKII. I personally owned and experienced the Monarch MKII, and it was truly exceptional.

After the Monarch MKII, I tried their HYPE series and their then-flagship IEM, the Prestige LTD. The LTD became my benchmark IEMs after the Monarch MKII, and I’ve been using them ever since.

But what really caught my attention was their first quadbrid IEM, the Origin. I couldn’t try them when they were released, but now I have the chance to review them. Before I proceed further, I’d like to clarify a few points.

Thieaudio has finally released its first Quadbrid IEM, the Origin. It boasts dual Sonion electrostatic super tweeters, dual Knowles TWFK balanced armatures, two Sonion 2600 series full-range balanced armatures, a 10mm custom bio-cellulose diaphragm dynamic driver, and a custom 11mm bone conduction driver. The shells are made from resin and are larger than other Thieaudio IEMs, but they are designed to be comfortable. I didn’t have any issues wearing or listening to them. They fit snugly in my ear, providing an isolate fit. The shell body is black, while the faceplate features a blue, yellow, and red accent that is artistically poured over and ends with the brand name. The pins on the shells are recessed, like other Thieaudio IEMs released after the Monarch Mark II.

One surprising feature of the Origin is the cable that comes with it. It’s called EliteNoir and perfectly matches the IEMs. The cable consists of 7x7x0.08mm Silver Plated Over 5N LCOFC wire and a 16x7x0.06mm Silver Plated Over 4N LCOFC wire. The cable structure includes 161 wires in a 20AWG configuration, with inner insulation and an outer layer of Smoke Black-Blue Soft PVC sourced from the USA. It also incorporates Spiral Shielding and Litz Type 2 technology for enhanced durability and reduced signal loss. The 0.78mm two-pin connector cable has a multi-termination system that uses 3.5mm, 2.5mm, and 4.4mm plugs as reattachable plugs.

Overall, the cable is well-made and feels and looks premium in the hands. The quality is significantly better than their previous cables, especially considering the fact that there are only two thick cables going left and right. This package comes with some exciting surprises. It includes a new carrying case made of Alcantara material. Besides this, it also includes three pairs of small, medium, and large pairs of silicon eartips, another small, medium, and large pair of foam ear tips, a premium high-quality microfiber cloth, and replaceable 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 4.4mm plugs.

In terms of technical specifications, the impedance is 9 Ohms, and the sensitivity is 102dB. The frequency response is from 20Hz to 44kHz.

**Sound**

https://preview.redd.it/r4ooz1srymxe1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efd689cbfe2dbc40f965f4bbd5d0b38a1e7ec238

Starting with the overall sound response of the Origin, it’s tough to say if it’s a Thieaudio IEM. Having heard and tested mostly Monarch Mark II, Hype series, and Prestige LTD, I can acknowledge Thieaudio’s in-house sound. But these aren’t different from how they tune their IEMs; it’s more like a fresh take on what they can do with a quad-brid IEM. Most people probably felt the same when they first tried the Monarch. Now, the response leans towards a V-shape sound signature with a neutral-like tuning. But the way the drivers are implemented, it sounds more like a V-shape IEM.  Having great emphasis in the sub bass and balancing it out across the spectrum as if Thieaudio declaring that they can make the best basshead IEM in the world, which is quite, in fact, an impression which they left on me. 

I am an audiophile, but I also love listening to bass, and I do consider myself a basshead as well. I’m an audiophile, but I also love listening to bass, and I consider myself a basshead. I didn’t own Thor Mjolnir MKII if it wasn’t for its satisfying bass. But as a basshead, I had a conflicting understanding that bassheads had to either listen to complicated tunings like the Thor Mjolnir MKII, IE600, and Pilgrim or warm and dull-sounding IEM alternatives like Fatfreq Maestro mini or Scarlett mini and Xenns UP, having great sub bass and less lively treble but proves to be great being a basshead IEM. I always wanted a neutral sound like Monarch MKII, Ra, Mega5EST, etc., but I also wanted monstrous bass yet clean across the spectrum. 

And by the time I was whisking away in these thoughts, Origin dropped, like as I was anticipating Thieaudio’s take on basshead IEMs, which to be honest I did, because I wanted one while pondering upon if they will release one, one day. And now that they did, after reviewing these, I can definitely say that these are the best basshead IEMs you can get under $1000 , or maybe more if you explore these. Let’s dive deeper into the sound to find out more. 

**Treble**

Nothing else would have crossed my mind if I had been completely engrossed in the bass’s happiness. Isn’t that a typical basshead’s habit? Well, the same thing happened to me until I actually started appreciating how well-tuned the treble region is. The extension and expressions of the notes are nothing short of surprising, striking me how well-expressed and neatly placed the treble region sounds. Despite knowing that the bass has such a prominent emphasis, and the mids sounding balanced but revealing, the clarity and details in the treble region are still well-noticeable, which is commendable. Therefore, I enjoyed the treble.

The upper treble is smooth-sounding with good details and sharpness in the notes, producing a smooth and rich presentation. The vocals and instruments have that bite and air, yet they dissolve into the blendfulness of the response, unlike how I appreciate on my Prestige LTD. However, the clarity shares a resemblance, even if it isn’t as airy or spacious sounding like the Prestige LTD or the other Thieaudio Kilobuck IEMs. The same love goes for the lower treble, which sounds vibrant and clear. I never expected it to sound as revealing as the Monarch MKII, but again, implementing that in-house sound, the response has a good resemblance. The vocals and instruments have good note weight and sound vibrant and clean, though not as much as to sound sibilant, peaky, or hot. I would rather call it a slight setback in comparison to other IEMs I have heard that are much more vibrant and airy sounding.

Being a basshead IEM, and the way the treble is projected over the listener does give this sense of a less lively sound. However, with the right track, it sounds as competent as other IEMs. Listening to Akuma no ko by Ai Higuchi had me mesmerized not only because of how the bass sounds cinematically shifted but also how the other instruments, whether the piano, percussions, or cymbal hits, sound. The vocals haven’t diminished, and neither have any instruments, especially those that emphasize. However, if I were to critique, it would be that the airy and spacious feel of the song has been lost, along with that sense of orchestral presentation. The closeness of the notes with vibrancy and a favorable tonal balance still offers a fresh perspective on this track, particularly how the vocals capture that physicality and realistic sensation. Overall, the treble region is detailed, smooth, and upfront. 

**Mid Range**

As I mentioned earlier, the resemblance between the sound of other Thieaudio IEMs and the Origin is quite striking. However, what truly captivated audiophiles when the Monarch MKII was released was the way the upper frequencies unfolded to the listener, particularly the upper midrange and lower treble. This engagement and naturalness was a hallmark of the Monarch MKII. The Origin shares this characteristic, but it has a unique effect on me. The lower midrange, the bass, and the implementation of BC drivers contribute to the Origin’s sound profile, making it a more captivating listening experience.

To be honest, the Origin might be the only IEM after the Hype 10 that sounds so forward and natural in the midrange. I’ve listened to other IEMs with similar characteristics, but the Origin stands out. When it comes to Thieaudio and other flagship IEM brands, they tend to focus on every detail, but they may not be fully appreciated unless the listener takes the time to fully immerse themselves in the experience. This is why people often argue rather than simply enjoying the music. I don’t blame anyone for this; it’s just the nature of the beast.

I experienced the same feeling when I first heard the Origin. The more I listened, the more I was lost by how each and every piece of the track fell into place, the notes’ integrity intact, the smoothness in the tones, the vividness and clarity in both the instruments and vocals simply amazed me, even with the amount of bass it had, though the reason why, I will share when I describe about the bass. 

The upper midrange has a forward and engaging quality that enhances the overall presentation, resulting in clear and detailed sound. The vocals sound distinct, and the instruments respond to each note with elegance, which may be due to the implementation of a bone conduction driver. I’m certain the BC driver is playing a significant role. The notes have a more lively quality, more like liofe in them with a revealing and unique yet real feel that I believe is only possible with the implementation of the bone conduction driver. I’m not making any assumptions or claiming nonsense; I’ve experienced similar sensations in Unique Melody IEMs, particularly the MEST series and MEXT.

On the other hand, the lower midrange was quite different from what I’m accustomed to. The tactile sensation of each note, even when they’re enough dense and thick, felt satisfying and contributed to the overall richness and dynamism of the sound. The vocals had a girth and vibrato that was well-presented, and the instruments had a heft and richness that felt almost as if my ears were right beside them.

For instance, when I listened to “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” by Bobby McFerrin, I could definitely sense the influence of both BA’s and BC’s in the track. The whistles had a deeper and more distinctive character, and the accapella, if I’m not mistaken, felt as if they were breathing and living within the music itself.

Listening to the track “Gypsy” by Fleetwood Mac, the electric guitars at the beginning of the song brought a unique individuality to the instruments, and the strumming of the acoustic guitar was crisp and full of brim with each strum. The vocals harmoniously intertwined with the instruments, creating a blendful yet distinct sound. It’s truly remarkable for a basshead IEM to produce such a sound.

While I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s the best IEM out there, I can surely expand on its uniqueness and offering new flavour indeed. The overall presentation of the midrange is lifelike, vivid, and rich.

**Bass**

Having practically promoted the Origin for its treble and midrange sound feels strange and might have led to misconceptions about me. Was I intoxicated while listening to these? I was high on coffee at the time, if you ask me. But joking aside, I was intensely absorbing a lot to satisfy my curiosity. Was I really drunk when I wrote “lifelike” or “vibrant” descriptions, even though they are advertised as bass-heavy IEMs by Thieaudio? It took me some time to understand, and all settled with the bass.

It’s not contradictory or confusing to say that most bass-heavy IEMs don’t sound as well as I described Origin. However, one thing that sets the Unique Melody IEMs apart, and indeed the Origin IEMs, is the way bone conduction is implemented. It’s not exactly the same, but it’s similar. I believe the purpose of bone conduction is to enhance the sense of specific regions in the track that are subdued by the overwhelming bass. It adds a touch of physicality and realism, but more importantly, Thieaudio consistently finds a way to achieve those natural yet detailed tones that people fell in love with when the Monarch MKII was released. They’ve incorporated this approach into all their IEMs, and it’s why the Origin IEM sounds so distinctively and tastefully unique.

Now, to be precise, the emphasis is obvious, which is in the subbass. It has an usual feel to it, with the impact, punches, and rumble all set so well in control yet sounding explosive with grace in tactility and speed.

One thing that’s a bit questionable is how much bass is too much bass. As a basshead, I’ve never had to deal with that, but I’d like to expand on the Origin IEM and claim that no matter how bassy it is, it’s just perfect. The subbass complements the quality and quantity of the bass, and most IEMs probably miss out on that front. Don’t worry, it’s still a basshead IEM. Of course, you’d want a sub bass with that subwoofer feeling, but it delivers more than that. The clarity and cleanliness sink you in, enveloping you with that exploding bass that’s accurate to a point and textured the best I’ve heard on a basshead IEM. Not that it’ll be the best bass in terms of details and texture, but for such an overwhelming presence of bass, it’s truly impressive. The bass delivers quite a blow yet retracts with no traces, and this is where the mid bass lacks. I don’t mean it in a negative way, but the lingering warmth and heft is somewhat missing, which is both a good and a bad thing. Of course, craving that rich and warm lingering bass that sounds rich and dense is what it can’t do. It’s how it’s tuned, but it delivers the bass in a way that the actual instrument projects. The bass guitars and drums have such distinct and revealing quality that it impeccably provides the missing characteristics back into the sound, though of course, with the help of the BC driver. The way it manages to not sound hollow and lean is what makes these an artful piece.

Again, I’d like to mention that it’s not that the mid bass is nonexistent. The slams and thumps sound very real, but not as meaty or heavy as it would sound for a whole rounder bass. The tactility or the physicality it imposes on the track itself is very encouraging to listen to more tracks. Tracks like “4eVR” by Hiroyuki Sawano, “Shadow is the Light” by The Sixth Lie, and “Tactics” by Saiki have those drums acting strong and revealing each every drop or hit on the notes effortlessly. The bass notes reverberate and deepen the bond with the listener and the track while retaining all that clarity in the upper frequencies. In fact, there were many tracks that would have sounded pounding hard with such emphasis, but it seems like any electronic, metal, rock, or even pop genre tracks weren’t able to release that much imposing quality. Or rather, the bass is exceptionally tuned that the control over the notes was a piece of cake for Origin. So, all in all, the overall presentation of the bass is rumbling, strong yet well-controlled. 

**Technical Performance**

https://preview.redd.it/rsmnmhrpymxe1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1c27dd1803c1a5b1cf2bc2b534fd7f94b1effd8

Now techinically, the way the tuning is done I would have not expected it to express such revelation of notes. The separation and details were there, but it delivered a very technical sound as well. Though it may seem like the best out there, it’s not the best, but it’s definitely better than most IEMs, especially for bassheads. Let’s delve deeper into the details.

**Soundstage, Imaging & Separation**

I’ve always been impressed by how airy and spacious all Thieaudio IEMs sound, but this might be an exception, it’s not the widest-sounding in the bunch. As mentioned before, the air and spaciousness are definitely there, enough to make vocals and instruments sound complete. But the stage isn’t very holographic; it’s intimate and close, more like wrapped around the listener. The imaging is sharp and precise, just like you’d expect from a high-end IEM. Despite the intimate stage, the separation between notes is impeccable and distinctive, and you can easily point out the direction of elements coming from.

**Speed and Resolution**

The resolution is excellent, but compared to its big brothers, it doesn’t reveal as much. However, from an overall perspective, I find these sounds well-expressed in both micro and macro details. The attack and decay of the notes are very fast, which helps maintain a steady rhythm. The revelation of the notes is particularly clear and distinct.

**Sony WM1A -** While listening to Origin with WM1A, the response was much more open, creating an air that allowed the vocals and instruments to sound more spacious and lively. The bass was big, but the mid bass was as it was with every pairing. One interesting thing was that the bone conduction was delivering better sensation to each note, bringing more life to any track I was listening to.

**FiiO M15S -** While listening to Origin with the M15S, the energy and vibrancy of the music went up a notch. The treble and midrange had more forwardness and clarity, while the bass sounded more controlled. The dynamic and BC driver felt less reactive to the emphasized lower regions of the tracks. The subtlety in the notes was pouring in, which made it sound better technically but more neutral tonally.

**iPod Classic 5.5 Gen (RockBox) + Aune X7S -**  This pairing with the Origin sounded surprisingly good. The response sounded meatier and mid-bassy while maintaining a clean and forward sound, similar to all other pairings. It had a more prominent presence with good width and depth, rather than being at the back of the head. Whether it’s bass, midrange, or treble, all frequencies are pushed forward and blend seamlessly to deliver more pounding and slamming bass while maintaining control and taming the nuances of the notes. The overall presentation had a warm and balanced sound, unlike the V-shape. I’m certain that if the Origin are paired with warm sources like tube amps, they will win over everyone’s hearts. 

**Origin vs Prestige LTD**

https://preview.redd.it/rh8g9kllymxe1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9133d252b02756bbf0adaa6bca76bba29850897

I used to own the Monarch MKII, but I sold it because I was drawn to the Prestige LTD. These IEMs had a more revealing sound with airy and expansive treble, and they were more detailed. The tuning was the same to me, though. The same is true for almost all the IEMs Thieaudio has in their lineup. However, what defies such a response is the Origin. It doesn’t sound entirely different, but it does sound different even though it has that Thieaudio sound.

Technically, not all Thieaudio IEMs sound the same, but they have similar properties and characteristics that feel like Thieaudio DNA. That’s what I felt when I heard the Origin. The Prestige LTD’s response is very spacious and airy compared to the Origin, but on the other hand, it seems that the Origin has a livelier and engaging sound that keeps the listener involved.

The special sauce seems to be the magic of bone conduction. It keeps the listener on the edge of their seat when listening to the bass and the lifelike vocals and instruments. Although it’s not that every track will reveal it. The Prestige LTD is just more spread out and far-sounding, which brings better resolution, stage, separation, and imaging. However, the details are far more approachable when listening to the Origin because of that intimate and close sound.

Even though the midrange and lower treble sounds almost similar to each other, the dynamics play differently, which is why I find the Origin refreshing to hear. However, to be honest, going back to my LTDs was difficult. After listening to the Origin, the LTD sounded lifeless and muted. The truth is, the Origin is V-shaped sounding, which is meant for that fun and engagement while the LTDs are practically neutral with a subbass boost that gives that extra oomph and considered an all-rounder.

There are numerous IEMs with diverse tuning and preferences available for under 1000 USD, and they have consistently maintained their position as excellent sounding IEMs. However, the Thieaudio Origin stands out as a true gem that deserves more recognition. Even if this review were to be written as a novel, the Thieaudio Origin would undoubtedly inspired me to become a novelist. I have often been amazed by their offerings, and the Origin takes the cake. It completely shattered my preconceived notions about what a basshead IEM can achieve, essentially debunking the misconceptions I held about them. Theiaudio’s rendition of the Origin is undoubtedly the beginning of what is to come in this series, and I eagerly anticipate trying out their new offerings in this segment. It’s remarkable that a basshead IEM can accomplish what other non-basshead IEMs are striving to achieve, all while maintaining its basshead identity. No wonder I will enthusiastically recommend these IEMs to anyone who appreciates tasteful bass without compromising on details, clarity, and overall tonality. I genuinely mean it. ",2,1745872367.0,headphones,0,1.0,False

We’ve been living together for about 11 months now, and honestly, it's been mostly good — like, we’re not best friends, but we coexist fine. I work full-time and she's freelancing, so she's home a lot more than me.

This probably matters: we never officially talked about a cleaning schedule. It was just kinda understood that we’d keep common areas neat. At first it felt pretty balanced, but over time, I started noticing that I was doing almost all the dishes, wiping down counters, even vacuuming the living room without anyone asking. I'd mention it casually — like, ""oh, dishes are piling up again haha"" — but she’d just laugh it off or say she’d ""get it later.""

**Main Situation:**  
A couple weeks ago, I hit a wall. I came home from a long shift and the sink was full, there was sticky stuff on the coffee table, and the trash smelled... *off.* Instead of cleaning it all like I usually do, I decided to just... leave it.  
I figured, maybe if I stop swooping in, she’ll see how bad it gets and actually *do something.*

Spoiler: she didn’t.  
Day after day, I’d come home to the same mess. She’d still have friends over (including a weirdly specific memory of them eating nachos and just leaving the plates out?? like who does that?). I started avoiding the living room completely, eating in my room, basically feeling like a guest in my own home.

After about a week, Claire cornered me one night — and I mean, not *aggressively,* just like, blocking the hallway — and asked why I was ""being petty"" and ""refusing to help around the house anymore.""  
I kinda lost it. I told her I wasn't her maid, and that I was tired of doing *everything* while she sat around. She immediately got defensive and said, ""Well, if you had a problem, you could’ve just asked me to clean instead of acting like a brat.""

Which, like. I *did* ask? A bunch of times?  
I admit maybe the way I handled it — just letting it build up instead of sitting her down properly — wasn't the best. But I also feel like it shouldn’t be my job to manage another adult?

**Resolution Attempt:**  
After our fight, I wrote a little cleaning schedule and taped it on the fridge. It wasn’t super strict or anything, just like, ""Claire - dishes Tues/Thurs, Me - dishes Mon/Wed"" kind of stuff. I thought it’d be a neutral fix. She ripped it down the next day and said, ""We’re not in kindergarten.""

**Current Status:**  
Now the vibe at home is super tense. She’ll clean random things *really loudly* (like aggressively banging pots while washing them?) and keeps making little digs about me ""being too busy"" to help.  
We haven’t really talked beyond like, “Hey,” and honestly it’s exhausting.  
I’m lowkey wondering if this is even fixable or if I should just move when the lease is up (in August, btw — small win?).

AITA for letting the mess pile up instead of just being direct again? Was that petty? Or am I right for finally drawing a line?",36,1745872235.0,AITAH,11,1.0,False
1ka5r50,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrizzlySMS/comments/1ka5r50/one_number_endless_uses_why_you_need_a_virtual_us/,"One Number, Endless Uses: Why You Need a Virtual US Number","Hey Reddit! Let’s talk about something we’ve all dealt with: that sinking feeling when you *have* to give your phone number to yet another app, website, or marketplace stranger. What if I told you there’s a way to keep your real number safe while still accessing everything you need? Enter virtual US numbers. Here’s how one temporary number can solve a dozen problems.

# Why Even Use a Virtual Number?

Your phone number is a master key to your identity. Hand it out freely, and you risk spam, scams, or even identity theft. Virtual numbers act as a disposable shield. They’re perfect for:

* Signing up for apps/services without linking your real digits.
* Selling stuff online (Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace) without doxxing yourself.
* Traveling abroad but needing a US number for verification.
* Managing side hustles (think: separate numbers for Uber, DoorDash, or freelance gigs).

And the best part? You can ditch the number when you’re done—no strings attached.

# 10 Ways I’ve Used a Single Virtual Number

1.     **Secured a Burner Instagram** for my niche meme page (RIP, Algorithm).

2.     **Signed up for Food Delivery Promos** without spamming my main email.

3.     **Protected My Privacy** when selling my old couch online.

4.     **Tested Beta Apps** without risking my primary account.

5.     **Accessed Geo-Restricted Streaming** while visiting family overseas.

6.     **Created a Business Line** for my Etsy shop (no extra phone plan needed).

7.     **Avoided SIM Swap Scams** by using a temp number for crypto exchanges.

8.     **Joined Anonymous Forums** without tying them to my identity.

9.     **Secured Free Trials** (Netflix, Hulu) without cancellation hassles.

10.  **Verified Backup Emails** for my “oops-I-forgot-my-password” moments.

Most platforms (Google, Twitter, Uber, etc.) accept virtual numbers for SMS verification. But heads up: WhatsApp and some banks block them, so always check first.

# My Pitfalls and Wins

I’ve tried *a lot* of providers. Free services? Recycled numbers that got insta-banned. Cheap ones? Delayed SMS codes that expired before arriving. The exception? Grizzly SMS. Their numbers worked seamlessly for me across 90% of platforms, and I could even choose a local area code to avoid raising flags.

Pro tip: If you want to [get a virtual phone number USA](https://grizzlysms.com/countries/usa?utm_source=reddit), prioritize providers with real customer reviews. I learned the hard way that “too good to be true” pricing usually is.

# Why This Matters

A virtual number isn’t just for techies or paranoid folks. It’s for anyone who values:

* Control: Decide who gets your real contact info.
* Flexibility: Need a number for a week? A day? Done.
* Cost-Efficiency: For less than a coffee, you avoid endless spam.

Final Takeaway: Virtual numbers are like digital duct tape—they fix a ton of problems you didn’t know you had. Just avoid sketchy providers, and you’re golden.

Just wanted to share a little adventure I've embarked on here in NL. I've finally signed up for a proper Dutch language school to get past the ""zero Dutch"" stage (aiming for that sweet A1!).

Quick heads-up though, this is already proving... interesting! I figured, being a total beginner (A0 and feeling very A0), there'd be at least *some* English happening, you know, for those tricky grammar bits or when I look completely lost.

Nope. My teacher is a Dutch-only zone. Like, impressively dedicated to the immersion! We're talking basic intros, ""hoe gaat het,"" the whole alphabet soup, but the explanations? All in Dutch. Lots of pointing, charades, and hoping you catch the drift through context (and sometimes, sheer panic!).

Has anyone else kicked off their Dutch learning journey this way? At the absolute beginner stage, was your teacher also strictly Dutch-speaking? Is this a super common approach here?

Honestly, it's a bit overwhelming, feeling like my brain is trying to do gymnastics it's not ready for. But hey, I guess it's sink or swim, right? I'm really trying to embrace it.

Anyway, if any of you lovely folks have been through this or have stellar recommendations for resources that clicked for you when your in-class experience was fully immersive from day one (beyond the usual apps!), please pretty please share your wisdom!

Not all services are equal. Some get blocked fast, others charge hidden fees. After testing a few, I stuck with Grizzly SMS—their numbers worked for Telegram, Gmail, and even my local gym’s app. Pro tip: Avoid free services; they often recycle numbers or sell your data.

**2. Buy a Temporary US Phone Number**  
This takes 2 minutes. Go to a provider’s site (I use [Grizzly SMS](https://grizzlysms.com/countries/usa) when I need to [buy a USA phone number online](https://grizzlysms.com/countries/usa?utm_source=reddit)), pick a state, and pay. Prices start under $2. No SIM card, no contracts.

**3. Use the Number for Verification**  
When signing up for your alt account, enter the virtual number. You’ll get the SMS code instantly. Copy-paste it, and boom—account created.

**4. Manage Your Alt Account Safely**

* Never link the alt account to your main email or personal info.
* Use the virtual number *only* for verification—not 2FA.
* Delete the number after use (unless you need it again).

**Why This Works (and Pitfalls to Avoid)**

I’ve used this method for:

* A burner Instagram for my art page.
* A Craigslist account to sell old furniture.
* A Netflix trial without my main email.

But watch out:

* Some platforms (like WhatsApp) block virtual numbers. Always check if your service allows them.
* Don’t use the same number for 10 accounts—it’ll get flagged.

# Final Thoughts

A temporary number costs less than a coffee and saves you from spam, scams, and sleepless nights. If you’re paranoid like me, it’s worth the small hassle.

If you’ve had bad luck with virtual numbers before, try a different provider. Some, like Grizzly SMS, let you pick numbers from specific states, which helps avoid suspicion. 🐻📱",1,1745871803.0,GrizzlySMS,0,1.0,False

It’s a riveting movie despite 90% just being dudes sitting around a conference table talking. Stacked cast led by Kenneth Branagh as Heydrich and Stanley Tucci as  Eichmann. Anyway, the parallels of theme with Andor, about the banality of evil and the machinery of oppression all are obvious, but I was really struck how clearly similar in style and tone the S2E1 “Ghorman Operation” planning conference scenes are with Conspiracy. Down to the numerous sidebar conversations between the officers where they’re planning something horrible over coffee and snacks. Did anyone else who’s seen both think this? Has Gilroy or any of the other creators mentioned Conspiracy as an inspiration? I’ve been avoiding the press stuff ahead of S2 since they tend to drop spoilers.

He thinks the world of his brother, and 2 sisters.  Anytime they say something or suggest something, he does. I'd they say try this certain type of bread at Costco, he tries and thinks it's the greatest thing in the world.  He will not waste it and always says how good it is.  If his immediate family suggests to do something, he wants to do it no matter what. 
When he goes above and beyond for them, his explanation is, they do so much for so and so and he attempts to make me feel guilty.
When he describes issues with his sister he says to me, how would you like it if this happened to you?  I finally said to him, why do you keep approaching me in this manor?  I never said anything opposing her or her situation? Then he just mumbles to himself.
I feel like a secretary to him. When he wants me to give a bottle of coffee cream to send it along to his work, I said, you're welcome, because he just says OK, and don't forhlget to do this etc.
He talks at me and is so very pleasant when his sisters or brother and wife call him. He sounds very upbeat and happy. 
When he talks to me I don't get that upbeat happy tone.
I really am not sure what to do because if I bring it up to him, he gets really annoyed and tries to say it's my fault or it's my attitude problem.  I'm at my wits end.  Plz any suggestions would be helpful

I (F, 27) found out that my boyfriend (M, 37) has been messaging his ex-girlfriend — the one who they broke up five years ago. They haven’t been together since, but they had a very close relationship and they were living together for almost 5 years.

I saw a whole bunch of WhatsApp messages between them. And honestly, some of it just doesn’t sit right with me.
They talk a LOT. They talk about work, taxes, opening companies, the trips they went, food, how time flies, wishing happy holidays like easter or Christmas, joking together…
It’s not explicitly romantic, but it’s so casual and familiar that it feels too close for exes.

Here are some examples of what I found:
“It’s been over 10 years since we met.”
“How’s the launch going?“
“Today the sun is out and it’s almost warm!”
“Happy holidays!” (with a heart emoji)
“If you ever come here, i will offer you a coffee and spritz. –noo i’m a herbal tea now. You should offer me tea.”
“I always loved your mom’s cooking. Hope you enjoyed this year’s Christmas food”


And just… a LOT of chit-chat over months and months.
All light-hearted, but it feels way too familiar for two people who are supposed to be exes and not involved anymore.
There’s no flirting, but it feels emotionally close in a way that makes me super uncomfortable. Like… why does he even need to maintain this connection? Why does he joke with her, share daily life updates, even vent about taxes and life problems with her?


I feel crazy because technically there’s no “proof” of cheating — but it feels like emotional disrespect and honestly idk if I’m overreacting or it’s really boundary being crossed. ",4,1745871571.0,relationship_advice,15,0.7,False

I’m starting the diet soon & i have the paperwork and have asked nuclear medicine a lot of questions but i have some random things i wanted to touch base with the community with that i may be overthinking.

-Plain black coffee made in a normal/cheap coffee maker should be fine right?
Paperwork says no instant coffee & that’s confusing me.
Should i buy a specific kind of ground coffee to drink during this diet? I often buy kinds that have a flavor added in and wonder if that may not work for this. Also i tend to drink 5 cups of coffee a day, i assume that amount daily should still be okay.

-i’m unsure if i can still drink decafe herbal tea during this diet? I have a collection of random kinds and flavors of tea bags of different brands but since idk every ingredient in every tea bag i wonder if i should just avoid tea during process.

-kinda funny question but like i said i am overthinking but i assume smoking weed during these two weeks is still okay? Not sure i’ll smoke much because this diet fucking sucks and i don’t want to get the munchies lol

-anything random that surprised you that you can’t have or should avoid?

-i’m a hairstylist and often have my hands in a form of chemicals and lots of products daily. I hope skin exposure to products or just daily prefume makeup lotion etc doesn’t need to be limited during this process as i know those things can enter our bloodstream through skin exposure sometimes.

1ka5hec,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoberCurious/comments/1ka5hec/7_tips_for_traveling_the_world_without_drinking/,7 Tips For Traveling The World Without Drinking,"\[27M\] I've been ""non-alcoholic"" for almost a year. Me stopping was a choice for health/wellness during a few months of marathon training, but I do hold the hard line as I definitely used to drink too much as a social crutch and am better off without. Moderation just doesn't work for me.

For a while- being a big leisure traveler across the globe- I was fearful of going on a vacation without drinking because I just felt like I'd have a way worse time. EVERYTHING travel feels like it revolves around drinking: airports, planes, hotel check-ins, dinners, activities, night-life, etc. Then I conquered this fear:

In the last year I've gone on a week-long roadtrip around Ireland/Northern Ireland, to two weddings, and enjoyed a Thanksgiving/Christmas/NYE all without alcohol. I'll be visiting 4 countries this summer known for their wine and cocktails, and plan to stay alcohol-free the whole time. And to my own surprise: I'm really not concerned. Guinness 0.0 and Coke got me through Ireland, and I'm sure I'll find other local brews to get me through those countries.

**I wanted to share 7 sober travel tips/reflections that have helped me, in-case they're helpful to others who are early on this journey:**

1. **The company you are with is the #1 determinant of how you feel being alcohol free while traveling.** If they're supportive and aware- you'll feel normal even if they choose to drink. However if they are pressuring you or making you feel bad/sad/FOMO for not drinking- it won't be fun. But know: they are the problem.
2. **Have a strong why that you can remember back to in times of weakness.** You can write some thoughts in a note on your phone, or just close your eyes for a second and put yourself back into the mind of you in a nasty hangover, dealing with hangxiety, being tired and lethargic, etc. Whatever it takes based on your personal reasoning for not drinking.
3. **Being Alcohol-Free doesn't mean all you drink is water.** Spice up what's in your cup to make yourself happy: coffee, tea, hot coco, local AF drinks, non-alcoholic beer/wine/cocktails (if you drink them). You're most likely saving a bunch of money no matter what.
4. **Expect certain people you tell (waiters, etc) to have a weird reaction at first.** But hold strong, know the wording that you feel most confident in saying (""sober"", ""alcohol free"", ""I'm not drinking, etc), and then just set your expectations low so they can only be exceeded.
5. **When designing your trip, swap late nights for early mornings in the itinerary if you can.** Destinations are usually quieter, more peaceful, and prettier when you get up early. This is my favorite part of traveling sober.
6. **If you're traveling with other people that DO drink, decide in advance what will happen if they want to do an alcoholic activity (ie. vineyard tour/go to a beer garden/etc).** Will you join but not partake, or will you do something separate? Know in advance so you don't get roped into things that make you uncomfortable.
7. **Switch the focus on drinks for the focus on food.** Do a walking food tour, get a cooking class, focus your days on the meals you're eating. Food tells us so much about culture, and when you focus on the food- the drinks become an afterthought.

Throughout this all- remember the benefits of your choice: you will feel great every morning, you'll remember everything you experienced, you can engage with locals and other tourists more authentically, you'll be safer, you can drive home at the end of the night (if you're driving), and you can know that you held yourself to your personal standard.

I hope this helps someone!!

CAVEAT: Group trips with strangers is tough if you're sober and looking to travel with other people in the 25-35 range to make friends. A LOT of those younger trips revolve around alcohol (bar hopping, drinks, etc) for the socializing, which is hard given rule #1 above. Some people might be chill about it, but just hard to know in advance. Then, while there are ""sober trips"" out there- they skew to folks in recovery or older travelers. I'm hoping to change that, but that's another story.",7,1745871536.0,SoberCurious,0,1.0,False

I believe this model has great potential, especially for those looking to enter the food and beverage industry with lower startup costs and overhead. It emphasizes community connection and personalized service, which can be a refreshing alternative to traditional cafés.

this caused me to think about other foods that had me feeling this way. whenever i drink any alcoholic beverages, i get vertigo and hives around my neck. i have also been drinking so many energy drinks (due to college) and has caused me to feel so tired and nauseous instead of energizing me. tried kiwi a few weeks ago and immediately my hands were itchy all over. i have also been often drinking spinach and banana smoothie this year, and have been feeling so sick this entire semester of college.

in addition, i'd always get random red spots around my neck and when i was younger, also on my forehead. doctor had prescribed me some cream and it never helped. anyways after doing some research on HI, apparently the appearance of these red spots may come from stress. and last night at the peak of my anxiety, i looked in the mirror and my chest had a bunch of red areas.

usually a fresh apple makes me feel better. ate a couple week old apple today (kept in the fridge) and it kinda made me feel sick too.

Setting there looking out into an open field looking out in the valley that was in between her and the Blue Ridge Mountains. As the sun light flickered through the tree leaves a gentle breeze blew through Abby’s long dark hair. 

A Ember eyed girl having an Asian look about her, as Abby’ set there looking out into the open field. She was thinking about what to write. Thinking about all that she wanted to say to her! Knowing all the stories that she had, had over centuries. The journey that she had from the time of her being born to being raised by Noah’ and his family. 

Knowing that she had already had a lot of it written down, but this was going to be a letter! A letter to her yet to be born daughter. But Abby’ knew exactly where to begin! And that was who her father was. And that brings us to where we find ourselves now!

As the sun light glistened across a 1940’s Indianapolis race track, the mornings mist had long since lifted. Revealing a track full of cars, cars that were being worked on, ahead of the race ahead. A race that meant so much to so many drivers, but one particular driver among them.

His name was Bobby’ standing there by his car with his brown brushed back hair, having a James Dean look about him. But that wasn’t what attracted Abby’ to him, it was his ambitions for racing and winning. Thinking back to the days of both of them hanging out at the corner cafe. 

As the people would soon gather there standing at and around the tables with their spirits high! As the coffee would brew, with plenty of food and talk all around. For in the cafe everybody knew everyone! Even the ones from out of town that was there for the race, it was the atmosphere at the time. When you could just stop and talk for bit, while enjoying some good food and the excitement that was to come. 

As Abby’ setting there with Bobby’ and the rest of the guys from the racing world, setting there looking out into a 1940’s Indianapolis street. Seeing as the cars of old would pass by, a world much different than what would be the world that Abby’ knew. 

From centuries ago Abby’ with every chance that she got, would find herself watching the races in a time when men would race in chariots. From an era when Rome was the center of the known world. Finding herself Watching the many of the chariot races from a top of the Colosseum of Ancient Rome from long ago. Never herself having raced in one of the chariot races, but often outside of the city she often race in a chariot. 

Racing outside of the city of Rome occasionally finding herself being raced by a group of soldiers. Some racing with her! With some not so much chasing her through out the city out into its vast land. But never to catch her! For she knew every part of the area, but she would always find her stopping to watch a setting sun. As it would shine its light through the Colosseum out into the city around it. A city in which she would race a chariot through out its streets! With not so much of the approval of the guard. 

Finding herself back in the cafe seeing Bobby’ and the rest of the guys talking about their cars. Seeing Bobby’ setting there cool as to be to everyone around him. Never wanting to settle for second best! Even with me. For love we had for each other was not only a completing one! But always trying to find the best of ourselves while at the same time. 

Finding ourselves holding one another closely settling up underneath a starlit sky above us. Something that both had in common with one another, not wanting to lose to the other, but at the same time loving finding love with each other. For Abby’s drive and determination to win, also at times clashed with Bobby’s need to win. But respect for the other they both had, for the many times that they both walked from one other after a race. 

Only to find each other again learning from the other, for the need to win was always there. But the moments that they had was always! and would as such for the love that they both shared for racing was just as strong as it was for each other. 

But just before the race would start Bobby’ was always there at Abby’s car, standing there with her. For the look in her eyes said it all! As Bobby’ slid his fingers through her long dark hair, while at the same time. Saying to her

“Even though I love you very much Abby’ don’t you think for one moment! That when it comes time to race. That I will you cut you a single break! Well maybe a little but only as a racer, depending on if it’s the last lap or not.”

With Abby’ looking straight at him in his eyes saying back to him

“Nor do I expect it! But no this! My rear end may be all that see in the race!”

With Bobby’ giving a little laugh saying to her

“God I love you! Now let’s get this race started, and we will see who is looking at who rear end.”

For Abby’ knew that the moment was forever going to be with her, but the moments with Bobby’ was all going to be over  way too soon.
As the crowd was slowly beginning to come into the stands for the race. 

Anticipation was high among everyone! As Abby leaned stood there by her car, as the breeze was blowing through her long dark hair. She was ready! Ready for the race ahead! A race that both her and Bobby’ had waited for all season, knowing that neither was going to summit to the other. With the crowd now at their feet as both Bobby’ and Abby’ set there in their cars waiting for the race to begin. But unknowingly to Bobby’ at the time, that this race would be the last for Abby’.

And the last time that he would see her! For soon after, Abby’ would soon take a journey! A journey that would set the stage for one last conflict with her brother. A brother who born just as she was, born of the same Watcher who was also the father of Abby’. 

Finding herself unknowingly at war or battle because of him, her brother who had took so many whom she had loved from her. Over the centuries! Knowing that she would eventually have to confront him again, knowing what he had done to not only her But so many before.

Making her way to join the war, and leaving racing behind her for now, but not forever. But even unknowingly to Abby’ at the time, was that she was carrying someone! Someone that would be some years later down the road before she would even know. 

For she was carrying Bobby’s child! For even though Abby’ was immortal! Her own mother had carried her for an entire Generation before Abby’ herself was born. For even though her mother was not immortal! Her father was! Himself being one of the Watchers from the time of Noah’. 

Leaving Abby’ to be raised by Noah’ and his family, and from there her journey into this Life began. But now as we find ourselves with Abby’ some years later after the war, finding herself at home! As the sun was beginning to fade behind the blue ridge mountains off in the distance. 

Setting there in her solid black 1968 Shelby Cobra GT that she had built Abby’ set there looking out across the open field. Watching the setting sun shine the last of its light down upon the open fields just ahead of me. As Abby’ set there watching her beautiful black stallion midnight’ as he grazed in the open field. 

Gripping her hands tighter onto the steering wheel giving one last look at a picture that was hanging from her visor. A picture of her and Bobby’ at Indy just before a race, it was Only a few times in her life that she would become close to someone in that way. 

Knowing that it would only be for a short time before she would have to give her goodbyes without saying goodbye. Knowing that it hurt more each time having to leave someone for years she had. But time few she had for the people around her, but unknowingly at the time Bobby would be once again in her life. But as not as she would have never even thought possible, for in time Abby’ would give birth to their daughter.

But that is a story for another time finding ourselves back to where we was looking out into the field just as she then started up her car. Hearing the engine come to life, with a roar as she gave it some gas gripping her steering wheel tight giving one quick look to her beautiful Midnight. 

As she then gave a shout to Midnight’ as he then turned Looking to Abby’ rearing his front legs high into the air. And with a smile Abby took off with a cloud of dust behind her making her way down the dirt road along the fence line. Midnight was there running in the field along with Abbys Shelby Gt. 

With the wind blowing in through the front window blowing through her long dark hair. She then gave one last look and smile over to Midnight’ as she then stomped the gas making her way down the dirt road a dirt road that was connected to her land in the blue ridge. 

As Midnight became smaller in her rear view mirror racing down the road as the sun disappeared behind the mountains in the distance. It was a road that Abby knew well, well enough she could race on it at night without any headlights on. For Abby would often race on it just to bring back the memories of her racing days. 

Days that meant everything to her when she was with the people that she cared for very much in life. With the people that would forever be in her memories even when everyone that you knew around you was gone. Her memories would always be there to help keep her going pulling up into her driveway making her way to her barn. Slowly getting out of her car looking up at the stars above her. 

Knowing that Handel’ was up there somewhere looking down to her always looking to Abby’ wherever her journey would lead. Seeing the stars as they shot across the night’s sky Abby’ would often think back to the times when she would be on top of Annapurna. Looking up into an endless starlit sky! Looking up into the Heavens above her. 

For many nights she would set a top of Annapurna’ looking up into the stars above her waiting the morning sun to rise. It was her place to go to think, to get answers for some answers to the question that she sought. Would sometimes not finding the true meaning of what she was told until at times years later. Helping her to become the person that she was now, helping and passing on knowledge to others along the way.

For Annapurna was the only thing left of what used to be her home! Her home before the flood. A place, a land that once was a lush endless landscape of all living things. For it very much reminded her of her home today there in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Before the flood of man changed everything that once was! 

Seeing how the world around her had changed over the centuries, seeing and learning new cultures. Some long gone, and some still hidden away within the land that is now. Seeing the towers of old! Become the towers of what is today. For man has always built to reach the Heavens above!  As memories began to flood back to her during her in the time of Babel. For many occasions finding herself racing horses across its desert landscape. A landscape that was once very different, for the flood had changed everything! The world that once was, the world in which Abby’ was born. Never again to be. 

For that was when she had also met her first love, Nineveh’ a rare blue grayish eyed dark haired and in tone. for a love a not only horses they shared. But racing them as well! Finding themselves racing others many times across the ancient lands of Babel’. Spending a many of nights sleeping up underneath a starlit sky above them. Holding one another close watching not only the stars shoot across the sky, but would also look at each other. 

For on some occasions Abby’ would teach and show Nineveh’ the star constellations, and what each one ment. For that was one of many things Handel’ had taught her about the Heavens above them. For on some very rare occasions one could see a shooting star, thinking to themselves a shooting star. But a shooting star it was not always for on rare occasions one may see a Heavenly Angel as it flys across a starlit filled sky. But that was a realm the even Abby’ could not venture to herself, for even if you was above high the earth. The realm itself was invisible to the eyes of man. For the even though desert landscape around ancient Babel was very much different from the time of Noah. 

It still had many treasures hidden from within it, and on many occasions Abby’ and Nineveh’ would spend many of a days. Looking and finding its treasures that the land had with in it. Riding horses into a sunset sky with the Ancient Tower of Babel’ shining from its light. But that was Before her brother, a brother who was going to bring a lot of hurt and loss to her along her journey. But at the time with her unknowing to the Days to that was to come.

But one thing seemed to remain in every century in every culture, and that was a need for racing in one way or another. Whether it be on foot or by horseback, by Camel, or on sheep’s back! Yes even sheep! With Abby’ thinking back to the time being there on a farm of one her friends. Her name was Avril’ looking at her with a smile along with a jester saying to her. 

“You know I bet you that I could beat you riding on one of them sheep over there”

As Abby’ then looked at her saying 

“Are you serious? Have a race on a sheep? Well count me in”

It was a funny moment, but a moment it was that Abby’ would never forget for the moments and laughs that they had together. Knowing that every race didn’t have to be so serious, just as long as you were having fun at the same time.

For remember the world that we know now, was not the world of yesterday. For racing has always been! For the need to compete with one another has and will always be till the end of every that we all know. 

Leaning there up against her car as the memories would flood back to her memories of a distant life’s. Finding herself racing horses through the ancient lands of yesterday! To the lands of where the people of yesterday would become the people of today. For she would often think to herself why was she born this way! why her! To live a life was to grow old with the ones that we loved. For people often dream of having an Immortal life but when you live an Immortal life. You only live to see time as it goes by leaving you with only the memories of the people around you.

Wiping away a tear from her eye as she then walked over to the barn looking up seeing Miranda her adoptive daughter setting there on the front porch. Giving her a wave knowing that her time with Miranda would be over all too soon. For it was a little over 60 years since she had brought Miranda home from the War. Like so many orphaned to the world around her from a world that orphaned her. For it would be just in a couple of years that Miranda’ would pass away quietly in her sleep. Waking into the barn flipping on a light Abby’ stood there looking into a mirror, seeing herself not as she was now. But looking at a samurai with her long dark hair flowing in and around her eyes. Holding onto a sword that was made specifically for her, a sword that bared her name from long ago Ena’.

For centuries have long since passed from a time that meant so much to her, memories that will forever remain with her. Memories of a love that has long since been gone, standing there seeing an image of a person that she once was. But now with her brother gone defeated! That person she was looking at in the mirror will be soon gone as well.

But for now the memories will forever be with her. Looking away from the mirror looking over at an Indy car that she once raced in. Seeing her race trophy’s that aligned the wall But one trophy stood out a trophy that meant just as much to her as her Indy win. And that was her Daytona 500 trophy! 

For after the War! After her brother! Abby never went back to full time racing. But It was not until about thirty five years later that she would first meet Harry’ the guys have given the nickname Harry’. But Abby’ would give him the nickname Little Bear’’ A fitting nickname for a man who was over six feet tall with a build like a bear. Also being that of Native American mix’ 

But the guys knew that only Abby’ called him Little Bear’ for he didn’t really have any family growing up with racing being his family. Until he met her met Abby’ who would kinda become a daughter to him. Even though she was six thousand years old! 

As Abby’ stood there looking at a Daytona 500 trophy, along with a picture hanging there of little bear and her race crew. With Abby thinking back to when she had first met little bear there at a local track where she would also meet the other guys. Guys that would soon become a family to her! For they would travel together to different local race tracks laughing and just enjoy life along the way. 

For in her many journeys Abby’ always knew that the moment would always be a memory as long as she would be. As long as the stars remained in the sky above! Abby’ would have the many memories of her journeys of the world now! And of her world from long ago.

As everyone got to know each other they would grow not just like a race team would grow! But as a family would grow! Racing at different events along the way always looking out for one another. With little bear even being a father figure to everyone! Even to an immortal! 

For Abby’ would often find herself talking with little bear, listening to him talk about the racers of then. For even though Abby’ was a racer of old! It was always nice to set there and listen to stories of others! 

For Abby’ had stories! Many stories but she had to always remind herself before she would talk! For you just couldn’t just tell anyone about your adventures from hundreds of years ago! 

But listen she would always. Even though they only raced smaller events we were a racing family to each other. A racing family that she hadn’t had since the early days of racing, but as Abby stood there in the her barn thinking back on her racing family. She remembered the conversation that she once had with little bear, for one night after a race he had told her that ever since he was a little kid he had loved racing. 

Looking up to the legendary drivers of yesterday and today, but as he got older he had always dreamed of racing against those guys. Abby remembered what he had told her that night as they stood there leaning up against the railing. For he was always amazed at Abbys driving abilities and her knowledge of building a race car. 

For he had never seen anybody with such knowledge that Abby had on building and driving cars. But Abby’ knew even though she had been driving and building cars for decades! She was only as good as what she had put into it! 

Even she was Immortal she also had to learn everything just as a human would have to learn. All of the knowledge of everything that she had learned over the centuries. Was taught to her by others around her, from casting and shaping metal into swords! 

From woven silk into clothing, learning traits and skills from many cultures before. But all above she had learned! She was always taught to set and listen! For knowledge was not a given! But what she always strived for. And what made her a good race car driver was not only her knowledge of the sport. But the fact that she had been racing and learning from others around her that made her what and who she was today.

Knowing that they would only be a part of her life for a short time, she knew right then and there. That She would do it for little bear! she would win him the Daytona 500 trophy. For over the next few weeks her and little bear along with the rest of the guys would build a car together. a car that would win at Daytona! 

For To little bear the trophy would be the world to him. But to Abby’ he was her friend! And together they were going to do it no matter what. For when that day had arrived! Abby’ and little bear and the rest of the guys unloaded the car there at Daytona. For that night Abby’ would find herself setting outside of the track looking up into a starlit sky. Looking to see if Handel might have been watching her! 

Looking as she thought back on there many conversations, conversations on when one would die. Some with all too short of a Life! And others only to know if they was in the Heavens above along with him. Knowing that Handel’ wasn’t allowed to tell Abby’ for at times she didn’t understand Life and Death. Being an immortal herself! Knowing that a person’s Life was sometimes unjust for the times that one would live. 

For often Abby would find herself looking into the Heavens above her thinking of questions as such. For even when her end would come, she would often have Handel there to talk to about said questions. But as the sun was just starting to rise that day the morning the morning mist was still all around the track. With Abby’ walking over to her car she saw little bear setting there on the pit lane wall. Making her way over to him little bear just looked over to Abby saying to her

“Every dream that have ever had I could have never dreamed this moment being here on this race track a race track where legends have raced. But most of all being here with you Abby’ for have helped to make this possible” 

With Abby’ standing there beside little bear looking up into the grand stands that would soon be full of fans. She would say to little bear

 “ No we made possible! We as a team you me and all of the guys together” 

With a smile little bear then looked to Abby saying 

“ Abby you could have been one of the greats! You still can! For I have never seen anyone who can handle a car like you do. So why didn’t you ever go for it all become a legend of this sport instead of wasting your time with an old washed up man like me” 

Putting her arm around little bear giving him a smile as she knew in her heart that she was exactly where she wanted to be. As she would say to little bear 

“You could had given me the world over! You could given me every racing trophy ever made! But there is one thing that this world could never give me and that is another you little bear” 

For to Abby’ little bear was like a father figure not just to her but to all of the guys. Even an Immortal needs someone in their life From time to time. Abby could tell that little bear was nervous as they sat there looking up into the grand stands. But in her own little way she let him know that this day was going to be ours. 

For no one was going to take that from us! Not on this day! This was going to be the day that we came! And we conquered Daytona! Just as the legendary drivers did of the past. And just as Abby told little bear that! They did just that! As Abby would hold up the trophy in victory lane there with little bear and the guys by her side. 

Standing there for a group picture everyone together as little bear put his hand on Abbys shoulder giving her the biggest smile in the world. Just right before the picture was taken that day. 

As Abby’ stood there in the barn wiping away a tear! a smile would come to her for she knew what little bear would have said to her. Just like on many occasions he would say 

“ Abby we may not be in this life forever! We may not win at every race but together you and I we can sure as hell give them hell this day!”

For it was the last time that Abby and little bear would race together for after that race little bears health would start to decline. With him passing away just a year later. 

As Abby then made her way out of the barn looking up into the nights sky above her she knew that somewhere up there little bear was looking down at her saying to her

“ go get-’em Abby! This race is yours and I will see you in victory lane here one day”

thinking to herself I will see you again little bear in victory lane some day when my final race is raced and my day is done I will see you then as well little bear in victory lane. Your friend 

Abby’

And with that Abby’ wiped away a tear from her eye, as she then made her way out of the barn. For the next couple of years would go by all to fast for Abby’ 

But just as he would on occasions Handel’ showed up but this visit would be different in a way that would see a journeys end. With Abby’ seeing Handel standing there not in his usual wear. But actually dressed as a normal person would dress, but this visit would not be easy for him. Running to greet him with a hug a hug of where have you been for so long. With Handel standing there in his not so usual wear with his long brown hair and angelic eyes. 

Him and Abby’ made there way out into the field as Abby’ turned to him saying 

“well now seeing that it has been a while a generation or two give or take a few! “

With him replying 

“ I am here to talk to you Abby! “

As Abby’ replied

“ how did you even know that I was going by the name Abby?”

With him replying

 “ Abby now you know me better than that! I have been watching you quietly over the centuries. Think back too when we first met. When I told you who and what you were”’

Thinking back 

“ I do remember but what are you implying Handel“ 

“ Think back Abby to when you was born! A whole entire Generation had passed when your Father one of the Watchers passed his seed into your mother that eventually became you!” 

Replying to Handel I said 

“ So the father of my soon to be baby was Bobby”

Remembering back when I first met him, I was working on my race car at the time when he came along. We had hit it off from the very first moment that we met soon after we started racing together. 

We lost together and won together but the main thing was we were a family together even if it was only a racing family we were still family. But after the War was over I never went back to him I never talked to Bobby again. But I would quietly watch him race over the years Till he later got married  then I just quietly left from his Life all together. And now the baby inside of me is now him being a part of me all over again. 

But Abby there is another reason that I am here to see you, and you may want to set down to hear this. Listening to Handel  as he talked in a way I knew in a way I sensed that something like this might happen. But I guess I just didn’t want it to happen for that is what I have always wanted from the first. 

And that was having a family! Placing his hand on Abby’s’ shoulder Handel’ then said to me 

“ I know you have Abby and I know that you lost a lot over the centuries but in order for your baby to be born you will Die” 

As I then hugged Handel holding him I ask him of one thing and that was for him to raise my baby. And to please give this to them when they are older for it means a lot to me.

For it was a Tarkhan Dress, made from every kinds of silk from every generation that ever lived after the flood. But please tell my child when they are old enough to tell them about me. Tell them all about my Life the Life that I Lived. 

And one last thing Handel promise me this, For this place here that we are now here in Blue Ridge will be my baby’s home. Walking over to next to the oak to where Miranda was buried setting there watching what was to be my last sunset ever 

Looking back on all of the sun sets that I had seen during my Life’s Journeys setting there I wondered to myself. What would you be like as you grew up how would you remember me. 
But know this my child know that I loved you so very much and with this I give you Life my child 

As I then gave birth to you naming you Abigail my Daughter know that I loved you very much know that in life and in death I will always love you

Your mother Abby’

I (F, 27) found out that my boyfriend (M, 37) has been messaging his ex-girlfriend — the one who they broke up five years ago. They haven’t been together since, but they had a very close relationship and they were living together for almost 5 years.

I saw a whole bunch of WhatsApp messages between them. And honestly, some of it just doesn’t sit right with me.
They talk a LOT. They talk about work, taxes, opening companies, the trips they went, food, how time flies, wishing happy holidays like easter or Christmas, joking together…
It’s not explicitly romantic, but it’s so casual and familiar that it feels too close for exes.

Here are some examples of what I found:
“It’s been over 10 years since we met.”
“How’s the launch going?“
“Today the sun is out and it’s almost warm!”
“Happy holidays!” (with a heart emoji)
“If you ever come here, i will offer you a coffee and spritz. –noo i’m a herbal tea now. You should offer me tea.”
“I always loved your mom’s cooking. Hope you enjoyed this year’s Christmas food”


And just… a LOT of chit-chat over months and months.
All light-hearted, but it feels way too familiar for two people who are supposed to be exes and not involved anymore.
There’s no flirting, but it feels emotionally close in a way that makes me super uncomfortable. Like… why does he even need to maintain this connection? Why does he joke with her, share daily life updates, even vent about taxes and life problems with her?

Am I overthinking this? Or is this a real boundary being crossed?
I feel crazy because technically there’s no “proof” of cheating — but it feels like emotional disrespect.
Would you be okay with your partner texting an ex like this?
Or am I making a big deal out of nothing?

Please be honest and thank you.

When I get used to a set of symptoms then more happen. My goal is not going to the ER. I'm pregnant which brings other symptoms and other anxieties because pregnant people are more prone to heart disease and blood clots. 

I moved into my own place so I'm trying my best to survive. I used to drink like a pot of coffee and be fine. Suddenly it started triggering panic attacks and all day anxiety so I switched to decaf. I bought my own bag of decaf to make at home but this stuff seems like it has caffeine and Ive been having PVCs chest pains, rapid and irregular pulse and sweating and I feel zoomie. Unsure why since the decaf at gas stations doesn't make me feel that but maybe because I make mine strong the little bit of caffeine in decaf ends up being more? Anyways, due to this I have been struggling to stay calm. But I'm stubborn and pregnant and I want my decaf! 

How do you talk yourself down and get out of the ""what if this is the time"" thoughts? ""What if I'm the 1%"" the what ifs get me as well as the symptoms intensifying when I try to ignore them. ",1,1745871156.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

I adopted a mixed breed puppy (I think there's some pitty/chihuahua/various other breeds in there), a few months ago and things have been going great. She came potty and crate trained and is very smart and quick to learn tricks, and loves people etc.

Problem is she's always been leash reactive (at least since her fosters have had her (which she was in there home from 2 months to right when I adopted her at 6 months of age).

We have taken a lot of obedience group training and doing agility right now.

I've worked on engage/disengage on every walk/opportunity I get (using a mix of kibble and treats as to not overfeed her) and her reactivity has become somewhat manageable but a lot to work on still. SO MUCH.

Also, I had taken her to this cute dog coffee place this past weekend where you can have lunch and your dog can run around play if they so choose to. We ended up leaving earlier as there were two older pups half her size that she didn't respect their space/boundaries and there was a scuffle (it was not bad and nobody was injured but definitely not good, of course and it definitely terrified me for a bit).

She did a trial at a daycare before and passed with flying colors. I ended up not taking her back due to work schedule and now she is with a ROVER sitter once a week that always has at least 3 other dogs and she does super well there.

Is there anything I can do that can help her to respect smaller dogs (and other dogs in general) space/boundaries? She also can be a little scared of bigger dogs and I have to tell her to stop humping my cat a lot so I think it's that she doesn't respect them. She's around 28 pounds FYI. Thanks so much!",1,1745871129.0,puppy101,3,1.0,False
