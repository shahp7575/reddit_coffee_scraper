1ipbbas,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ipbbas/the_blackdecker_dcm100b_coffee_maker_review_is/,The BLACK+DECKER DCM100B coffee maker review: is this 12-cup drip machine worth it?,"The BLACK+DECKER 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker (DCM100B) has been my go-to coffee companion for over a month now, and it’s seen me through countless bleary-eyed mornings. I rely heavily on my coffee maker to churn out a consistently good brew, and this one has delivered. While I’m largely pleased, there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design & Build Quality**  
This coffee maker features a sleek black exterior that fits well in both modern and traditional kitchens. Although primarily made of plastic, it feels sturdy and doesn’t come across as cheap. The Duralife carafe is a standout feature—it’s durable and easy to pour without spills (a critical point for someone like me who’s perpetually in a rush). On the downside, the button labels are a faint blue, making them hard to read unless you squint under bright light. My parents, who also tested it, found this particularly frustrating.

**Brewing Performance**  
Speed is where this machine excels. It takes about 12 minutes to brew a full pot, and the coffee it produces is rich and aromatic. The Sneak-A-Cup feature allows you to grab a cup mid-brew without ruining the process—a lifesaver for those mornings when patience isn’t an option. However, if you prefer your coffee on the stronger side, you’ll need to add extra grounds. The default brew strength is a little mild for my taste.

**Customization & Controls**  
The programmable QuickTouch buttons are straightforward, allowing you to set a brewing schedule. I’ve been using this feature religiously to wake up to a steaming pot of coffee. It’s simple but effective. That said, the lack of advanced customization, like adjusting water temperature or brew strength through settings, makes this machine feel a bit basic compared to others on the market.

**Ease of Use**  
Setup was a breeze, and I appreciated the intuitive design. The removable filter basket simplifies the process of adding coffee grounds and cleaning up afterward. My teenage daughter, who’s new to coffee-making, found it easy to figure out. That said, the faint button labels are an ongoing gripe, especially in low lighting.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Maintenance is straightforward, with most parts, including the carafe and filter basket, being dishwasher-safe. Since I have hard water in my area, I make it a point to descale it regularly with vinegar, which the machine handles without issues. However, I did notice that the lid of the carafe doesn’t always stay tightly secured, which could be a problem over time.

**Capacity & Size**  
The coffee maker brews up to 12 cups, but I’ve discovered that filling the water reservoir to the “weep hole” line yields almost 14 cups—a handy trick for hosting guests. Its compact design ensures it doesn’t hog counter space, even in smaller kitchens. Still, for households of one or two people, this might be overkill.

**Pros**

* Sturdy design with a spill-free carafe.
* Quick brewing time and consistent quality.
* Sneak-A-Cup feature for impatient coffee lovers.
* Programmable scheduling for added convenience.
* Easy-to-clean components and dishwasher compatibility.

**Cons**

* Button labels are difficult to read.
* No advanced customization for temperature or brew strength.
* Lid of the carafe feels a bit flimsy.
* Coffee might be too mild for those who prefer a stronger brew.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
When stacked against competitors like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew or the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Maker, the BLACK+DECKER DCM100B holds its own with its simplicity and reliability. Unlike the FlexBrew, which offers single-serve options, this coffee maker focuses solely on drip brewing. It also outshines the Mr. Coffee model in terms of durability, as the Duralife carafe is less prone to cracking. That said, the FlexBrew’s versatility and Mr. Coffee’s brew strength options might make them better choices for users seeking more features.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Considering its consistent performance and reliability, this coffee maker offers great value for its price. It may lack the bells and whistles of high-end models, but for someone like me who just wants a dependable cup every morning, it checks all the boxes. If you’re looking for a no-frills machine that brews decent coffee and doesn’t break the bank, this one’s worth considering.

1ipbat3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBrewery/comments/1ipbat3/low_carb_pastry_stout_on_nitro_help/,Low carb pastry stout on nitro help,"Howdy guys,

I designed a pastry coffee stout recently that was carbed lightly. The coffee roaster we worked with wants to replace their Guinness line with this beer. I’ve been researching before creating a Frankenstein U to D Sanke configuration and can’t seem to clear up my confusion. 

Some people say lower carb stouts pour fine on a nitro line and some people say it’s a nightmare. Does anyone have experience or thoughts on converting a Guinness line (handle and coupler) to a Sanke d type with a fairly dense stout? I imagine I’ll have to dial in pressure from co2 and nitro both to get it pouring correctly but I don’t want to invest in building this out if it’s simply just a bad idea.

1ipbans,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ipbans/compact_and_reliable_a_real_user_review_of/,Compact and Reliable: A Real User Review of Mixpresso 0722589233463 Coffee Maker,"I’ve been brewing my morning coffee with the Mixpresso 0722589233463 for a few weeks now, and I have to admit, it’s a mixed bag of convenience and quirks. This compact single-serve coffee maker promises versatility and speed, and while it delivers on many fronts, it has its fair share of idiosyncrasies.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was its compact size. With dimensions of 11.6”D x 19.8”W x 15.6”H, this coffee maker fits snugly on my limited kitchen counter space. Its black matte finish gives it a sleek look, but if you’re expecting premium materials, you might be disappointed. It feels light—almost too light—at just 1.8 pounds, which makes it easy to move around but leaves it feeling slightly flimsy. The plastic build doesn’t exactly scream durability, but it holds up well for daily use.

**Brewing Performance**  
The Mixpresso 0722589233463 shines when it comes to speed. It takes about 2-3 minutes to brew a single cup, which is a lifesaver during rushed mornings. The quality of the coffee is decent, but I noticed the flavor can lean on the weaker side. When I tested it with both K-cups and ground coffee, I found that the brewing strength varies. The machine’s quick brewing process might not allow the grounds to steep as thoroughly as I’d like. Still, the coffee comes out hot, though not piping enough to stay warm for long in my insulated mug.

**Customization & Controls**  
Operating this coffee maker is as simple as it gets. A single touch button handles everything, from powering the machine to starting the brew. While it’s user-friendly, it lacks customization options. There’s no way to adjust the strength or temperature, which might not satisfy coffee enthusiasts looking for a tailored experience. However, the inclusion of a reusable coffee filter is a nice touch for those who prefer using ground coffee over pods.

[Find the best price for Mixpresso 0722589233463 on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/mixpresso-0722589233463-review-b01e3x4ok6-detailed-analysis/)

**Ease of Use**  
I’ll give credit where it’s due—this coffee maker is incredibly straightforward. Filling the reservoir is easy, especially if you use a measuring cup or a pitcher rather than a coffee mug. However, the water tank isn’t removable, which could be inconvenient for some. The single-serve design means you pour in water for each brew, and it uses up every drop, so no leftover water sits around.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning this machine is relatively simple. The drip tray is removable, making it easy to rinse, although its capacity is limited. The reusable filter is eco-friendly but requires regular washing to avoid coffee residue buildup. Descaling the machine is necessary every few months, and I found the vinegar method effective in keeping it running smoothly.

**Capacity & Size**  
With a maximum brewing capacity of 14 ounces, it’s perfect for a single cup but might not satisfy those who need larger servings. The height clearance for mugs is about 4.5 inches, which works for standard-sized mugs but struggles with taller travel mugs. This limitation meant I had to transfer coffee into my travel mug on busy mornings, which was a minor inconvenience.

**Pros**

* Compact size fits small spaces perfectly.
* Quick brewing time, ideal for busy mornings.
* Compatible with both K-cups and ground coffee.
* User-friendly, one-button operation.
* Reusable filter included, reducing waste.

**Cons**

* Lightweight plastic build feels less durable.
* Limited to 14 ounces and struggles with larger mugs.
* Coffee flavor can be weak due to fast brewing.
* Lacks adjustable settings for strength or temperature.
* Non-removable water tank is less convenient for refilling.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
When I compared the Mixpresso 0722589233463 to a similar budget-friendly model like the Sboly Single Serve Coffee Maker, a few differences stood out. The Sboly felt sturdier and offered better brewing strength, but it came at a slightly higher price. On the other hand, the Mixpresso’s compact design made it more travel-friendly, fitting easily in my RV during a weekend camping trip. Against a mini Keurig, the Mixpresso wins on price but loses in customization options and mug compatibility. If you value simplicity and portability over features, this coffee maker is a solid choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
For its price point, the Mixpresso 0722589233463 delivers decent functionality. It’s not a premium machine, but its compact size and dual compatibility with K-cups and ground coffee make it a convenient option for occasional coffee drinkers or those with limited space. While higher-end models offer more features, they also cost significantly more, making the Mixpresso a good budget-friendly alternative.

1ipbami,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1ipbami/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

My name is David, and I’m a 29-year-old IT tech from New Jersey on a quest for a meaningful, long-term relationship with someone who shares my values and passions.

**A bit about me:**

I’m about 5’10”, bald but naturally blond, and I sport a stylish beard. My usual attire includes black band shirts and black jeans—think laid-back, metal-head vibes with a touch of nerdy charm. If that sounds like your kind of aesthetic, we might just click! (Pics here: [https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0](https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0))

**What I’m into:**

When I’m not diving into the worlds of extreme metal (Black Metal is my jam) or gaming, I enjoy spending time with friends doing things like:

• Camping trips under the stars

• Exploring museums

• Renaissance faire adventures

• Watching movies (especially showing my best friend ones he hasn’t seen)

• Playing board games or video games

Recently, I’ve started learning a new language (こんにちは!) and experimenting with building Gundam model kits.

**Professionally:**

I work in IT and hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. My job keeps me busy but also lets me hang out with a great group of coworkers.

**Personality-wise:**

I’m laid-back, lighthearted, and always quick with a joke to brighten the mood. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs (not even coffee!), but I’m completely cool with others enjoying their drinks around me. My friends would probably describe me as funny, reliable, and someone who thrives on meaningful connections.

**What I’m looking for:**

I’m hoping to meet someone younger (ideally between 18 and 24) who’s also looking to build a future together. I’d love to find someone whose experiences and goals align with mine, so we can grow and share meaningful moments side by side. While I don’t have a timeline in mind for things like eloping or kids, I value the idea of creating a life full of shared adventures and growth.

I’m especially drawn to someone with an average or slim body type. I’m not a fan of tattoos, but piercings aren’t a big deal, so don’t hesitate to reach out if we connect on other levels!

If you’re a fellow nerd, gamer, or someone who shares my love for metal, movies, and meaningful connections, I’d love to hear from you. Send me a message and a picture—I’m looking forward to getting to know you better!",1,1739541910.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1ipb9rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1ipb9rv/i_am_just_so_confused/,I am just so confused 🤔,"Growing up I would say I was a gay kid.  Attracted to men not to women.  But I come from a very homophobic family and area.

As I went into my teenage years I would get crushes on boys my own age but also fall crazily in love with girls.  I had girlfriends but no actual sexual experience with guys.

I did look at gay porn and some men turned me on. But I never actually wanted sex with a man.  I just liked their bodies if that makes sense?

I married my wife at 25, had children and life happened.  I occasionally looked at gay porn but other than that was the model straight dad.  No issues with sex with my wife I always enjoyed it.

I hit 40 and had a crisis of 'who am i' was I really gay but just very repressed?  I was dealing with an alcohol problem that I was using to numb stress and other issues.  I went on Grindr and after months agreed to a meet to get a BJ from a guy.  I came fast but hated the experience and the empty feeling it left me with.

I had a few more drunken meets via Grindr.  Always regretted.

I did make a connection with one guy 34, who seemed decent.  His pics were incredible, I thought he was a catfish at first.  I didn't have the courage to meet up as he insisted I would have to be sober and it wouldn't be outside only in his bed.

Randomly I bumped into him in real life and we recognised eachother from our pics I managed to get the courage up to say hello for real.  We had spoken for hours on chat.

I was blown away by him and his looks, I literally have never seen a better looking guy in my life.  I was even more blown away when he messaged me 5min later saying how attractive I was to him and he was desperate to take things further at my pace if I wanted.

It still took 3 meetings and alot of coffee for me to agree to try being with him.

It was incredible.  First time we took it slow and it was really intimate but didn't go too far.  He kept going on and on about how attractive I was which to someone who literally hates the way they look (body dysmorphia) was very validating.

Next few weeks were a blur of sex with him. And the sex was incredible.  Always climax together always intimate with sleep after.

Me topping him which he says he has very rarely let any man do apart from one bf.  I let him top me but it just wasn't my thing though I enjoyed the intimacy.  I have never wanted to be in a guy but I am addicted to being in him.

He would message me a few times per day about how he craved me and missed me.  He even told me he loved me and one very passionate moment.

Now there is a cooling off.  I was with him on Monday, great sex again but just an emoji sent after.  Days of no communication and I messaged him and just one emoji back.

I am thinking about him all the time.  The entire thing has been so validating and I can't bear it thats cooling off.

I should mention.  He is very sexualy experienced and in open relationships.

Also sexualy with my wife things have become more passionate and fulfilling since being with him.  I was always worried that maybe I was totally gay and would be unable to be with her after being with a guy.  Actually the reverse is true.

I am a mix of confusion.  Guilt at being with someone behind my wife's back.  Desperately missing his attention and confused about my sexuality.

Has anyone got any input?  Experienced similar?

**FNBS**

Raven Maddox: And to end on a happy note tonight; this just in: President-elect Jane Allgood is in good health aboard one of John Taylor’s private jets, now in the airspace of allied territories. An impromptu visit to the front line turned into an international incident when her convoy drifted into FEEN territory and was intercepted. Her press secretary says that the FEEN faction in the area treated her to a very comfortable _long weekend_. She dined on steak tartare, rice, spiced salmon curry, nuts and berries, and a selection of fine cheeses and wines. And for dessert, coffee and cookies.

Being held hostage isn’t quite what it used to be, is it?
***

**Bug Out**

Little Joe cut the lights, plunging the utility yard into darkness as they prepared to leave. The break-action twelve-gauge loaded with buckshot gave Gwen a sense of calm. She stood guard while the others piled necessities from the Jiffy Stop into Ol’ Betsy. They had packed three crates of supplies that, if rationed, would last them for a week without having to “figure somethin out,” as the old hippie had put it.

Little Joe was going to lead the way to Billings, but once there, he would have to leave them to see to some urgent business elsewhere. He refused to say more on this matter. His sister had agreed to let them lie low in her basement for as long as they needed, or as long as they could stand it—whichever came first. Her name was Katelyn, and she “knew things,” Little Joe said. Upon the style of questioning that cops were good at, Gwen was able to determine that though he loved his sister, he had not spoken with her for years and that she refused to have him at her house. “She’s difficult,” he had said, “but she knows about Maji stuff. Knows more than I do.”

She squinted to see the edge of the parking lot through the blowing snow. She had that feeling there was something out there, something coming, and they were just getting the jump on it by packing and leaving now.

There! Was that movement just beyond the charging stations? There it was again, by the barbed wire fence line that cordoned off the lot from the ditch. She stepped off the sidewalk into the shin-deep snow and ventured forward a few yards. God it was cold. Something was out there. Or was she seeing things? The tragedy at the station haunted her yet. She carefully put her finger over the trigger. Waited, her breathing shallow. Nothing. It was nothing, she determined, only the snow mixed with the wind and the murky night and her own nerves. She would feel a lot better when they were on the road.

“All done!” hollered Nash. The hippie was loud. He checked the crates in the back of his van and slammed the doors.

Alan, followed by the boys, exited the Jiffy Stop and helped them load into the self-drive semi-truck. Little Joe had allowed them all one backpack and told them to stuff whatever they could take in them. Ty had loaded up on two boxes of candy bars before his father stopped him and told him to choose clothes, a large bottle of water, and a first aid kit.

“I think we’re ready, boss,” said Little Joe.

“We should take the gun,” said Gwen.

“If we’re stopped, it’ll cause more problems than it’s worth. Besides, it’s heavy as hell, and you only got two shots.”

“That’s two shots more than none,” she said as she relinquished the weapon.

He put it inside and locked the door. “Guns and cops never turn out well. Don’t have silver ammo, either. You can’t kill a werewolf without silver ammo.”

She climbed into the big rig. A memory of her dad taking her on one of his runs flooded in. He was wearing his green and black flannel, a cigarette lodged behind his ear. He smiled and was speaking, but his words were lost to time. She should have gone in Ol’ Betsy.

“Gwen.” Alan touched her arm—she jerked it away.

“What?”

“Everything okay?”

“Yeah. It’s good.”

The semi-truck followed Little Joe’s Chevy pickup. Nash, Bridger, and the Greta took up the rear in Ol’ Betsy. Their caravan made a tidy fugitive sandwich locked in formation and synchronized to the self-drive grid.

She adjusted the driver’s seat. It felt stiff and unsuitable for human use. There was no steering wheel, but there was still a control panel where she could adjust an array of cameras. She flipped on the monitors at the front and scrolled through the settings until she had a 360-degree view spread across the windshield monitor. The satellite map indicated low traffic congestion. A red warning flashed: _Travel Advisory!_

The boys settled in the sleeper compartment and played on the phone Little Joe had given her. Alan rested in the passenger seat, staring at the monitors as the powerful truck plowed through the snowy night.

Despite the demise of actual human drivers, the truck companies kept outfitting their rigs with two seats and a sleeper, an uncanny reminder of a world that was no more—just in case this whole AI thing was a fad and humans were to someday rise to take all their jobs back from the machines.

The one-horse town of Ronan was quiet. Its traffic lights blinked orange, signaling through traffic not to bother stopping—nothing doin’ here. She scanned every angle for any sign they were being followed, by either automobile or bi-form creatures running in the snow beside them. She allowed herself a sigh of relief as they passed a sign that read, _Now Leaving Ronan_, and they started to pick up speed.

She was lulled by the sounds from Francis and Ty behind her—giggles, whispers, at times a partial conversation.

_Do you see that?_

_{whispers}_

_Yeah. It’s so crazy._

_Just let it dance._

_{laughter}_

_What is it?_

_The Veil, I guess._

_They can’t find you anymore, so you can touch it._

_White Owl says it’s what connects us._

_Okay, next stage. Boss level._

_{whispers}_

_It feels funny._

_{laughter}_

_I know._

_Not hot, not cold._

“You want to talk?” said Alan.

“You a shrink now?” she said it as a joke, but the sentence sounded jarring in the front of the cab under the lights of the control panel.

Alan smiled. “Touché. I guess what I mean is, all else being equal, you seem a bit…”

“Nervous?”

“I was going to say reflective.”

On the monitors before them, she saw the taillights of Little Joe’s pickup and the round headlights of Ol’ Betsy. From left to right, there was dark and snow. Now and then a yard light shined through.

“I told you my dad was part of the Highwaymen movement. It instilled a healthy disrespect for all things AI. I get it. It’s a losing battle. There’s nowhere to run.”

“You’re not very plugged in, are you?” said Alan.

“I’ve never used a headset,” she said.

“You’re joking.”

“Nope. No personal assistant either. If I had my way, I’d buy a farm and grow corn.”

“Even farmers use drones.”

“I guess it’s a moot point now. If I’m lucky, I’ll be able to just sit on my prison bunk and read. Your turn, Mr. Confessionalism.”

“Since you’re a cop,” he said.

“Ex-cop,” she corrected him. “Early retirement due to extremely weird circumstances.”

“Close enough,” he said. “I’ve felt like a fugitive my whole life.”

“You can confess. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to arrest you.”

“I failed,” said Alan. He gazed into the monitor, watching the taillights in the snow.

She had seen this gesture before. Sometimes she would book a drunk who beat his wife, a druggie who killed his mother, a perverse reprobate; they would sit unspeaking in the interrogation room because the act of verbalizing would be their undoing, no longer willing or caring to play the game of charades. They eventually spoke, but with the same hopeless exhaustion she felt in Alan, a fatigue that embraced incarceration.

After a few miles, he did speak, “I remember reading a case study when I was in school. This happened a long time ago. A nonchalant suburban man got sucked into dealing back in the early generation of the Escape drugs. The guy was an English teacher, and it started with one of his students who needed help or was going to flunk out of high school. The night he was set to tutor him was also the night the police stopped by, because the kid had a warrant out for his arrest. The teacher hid him until the cops left, then told him to get lost and fix his problems. The next thing he knows, the kid’s handler comes by and says he needs something delivered—all you gotta do is drive. Things just compounded, right? Well, six months later, his suburban house is has become one of the largest transfer hubs for Escape west of the Mississippi.”

“Jesus,” she said. “What a life.”

“Right. Thing is, during all this, he’s undergoing psychoanalysis at a Jungian clinic out in Santa Barbara. The drugs pay for it. At some point, the shrink asked him, why do you risk it all? He said that as the stakes get higher, he finds a new normal. He said he just goes with it. The deeper he goes down the rabbit hole of crime, the harder it is to find his way out.” Alan stopped talking.

“So? You’re just going to leave me hanging? What happened to him?”

“They found his body in a motel room in Modesto. Bullet hole between his eyes.”

“Christ.” She started laughing. “Are we in the rabbit hole, Dr. Smith?”

Alan shrugged. “We’ve passed the point of no return.”

“Our fates await,” Gwen said. “We find a way to make this concert happen.” She held out a fist for him to bump, and he took it, and they returned to the murmurs in the back.

Morocco. The land of vibrant colours, bustling souks, and captivating landscapes.  But for many, Morocco is also synonymous with mint tea – that sweet, fragrant brew that permeates the air and is woven into the very fabric of Moroccan life. But how did this ubiquitous beverage become so central to Moroccan culture? Let's delve into the fascinating history of tea in Morocco.

**A Relatively Recent Arrival:** Unlike many cultures where tea has a history spanning centuries, tea's journey to Morocco is relatively recent. It wasn't always the national drink.  Before tea's arrival, Moroccans favored other beverages like coffee and infusions of local herbs.

**The Introduction of Tea (19th Century):** Tea's introduction to Morocco began in the 19th century, largely due to trade connections with Britain. The British East India Company, already a tea powerhouse, played a significant role in exporting tea to Morocco, along with other European powers.  At first, it was primarily consumed by the upper classes, an exotic beverage enjoyed by the wealthy and influential.

**From Luxury to Everyday Staple:**  Over time, tea's popularity exploded. Several factors contributed to its widespread adoption:

* **Accessibility:**  As trade routes developed and tea production increased, the price became more affordable, making it accessible to the general population.
* **Adaptability:** Moroccans quickly embraced tea, adapting it to their own tastes and traditions. The addition of fresh mint, sugar, and the distinctive brewing style became a key part of its appeal.
* **Social Significance:**  The act of sharing tea became a powerful symbol of hospitality and social connection. Tea ceremonies developed, emphasizing the communal aspect of the beverage, forging bonds between family, friends, and even strangers.

**The Moroccan Tea Ceremony (A Ritual of Hospitality):**  The preparation and serving of mint tea in Morocco isn't just a drink; it's a ritual, a carefully choreographed performance demonstrating respect and hospitality.  Here's what you can expect:

* **The High Pour:** The teapot is held high, creating a dramatic cascading pour into the glasses. This aerates the tea, enhancing its flavor and aroma.
* **Multiple Servings:**  It’s customary to offer guests several glasses of tea – often three is the minimum – demonstrating generosity and hospitality. Each glass is usually stronger and sweeter than the last.
* **Fresh Mint is Key:** Fresh green mint is essential. It’s generously added to the pot, imparting its signature refreshing touch.
* **Sweetness:** Sugar is added to taste, often quite liberally.
* **A Sign of Respect:**  Refusing a glass of tea is considered rude, it's a symbol of connection and friendship.

**Today's Tea Culture:** Today, mint tea is more than just a drink in Morocco; it’s an integral part of the country's cultural identity. It's consumed throughout the day – from breakfast to evening gatherings, marking moments of celebration, mourning, and everything in between.  It's a ubiquitous symbol of hospitality, friendship, and Moroccan pride.


So next time you sip a glass of Moroccan mint tea, remember its rich history and the vital role it plays in this fascinating North African nation.  It’s more than just a drink; it’s an experience.

Now those experiences CERTAINLY did happen to those ladies , but I also wanted to throw a not horror story into the void for any anxious girlies such as myself . 


I think in a lot of ways the worst part was the anxiety leading up to it . I took my pills and within half an hour the cramps came on hot and heavy . It was extremely painful , there is so sugar coating that . The first hour or so it was just pain , sitting on the toilet , and mostly being scared I was going to feel that way for multiple hours . However , even after 1 hour the cramps started to become farther and farther apart . After 2 hours I was able to “ get comfortable “ . Hour 3-4 it really was just like the first day of a bad period and by hour 5 or 6 my tummy just felt sore . I slept without a heating pad . 

I was nervous because although I was cramping there wasn’t any blood for about two hours . I became anxious it wasn’t working . After my cramps subsided I started bleeding , and I probably bleed heaviest throughout the night when I was asleep . I woke up able to eat and drink again and the site of food not making me sick . I even was able to have coffee this AM . Having my body back after hosting something I didn’t want feels very good . 

I was 7 weeks and 3 days along . I’m going to take today to journal , go get my regular groceries and maybe walk on the treadmill to try to get myself back into my regular lifting routine . Man being a women is hard . Just know you can get through it short of any complications ( in which case listen to your body and your intuition ) . I decided to be alone for the thick of it as I was just on the toilet pooping. I was hungry after and opted for something light . I drifted off to sleep , fatigued from what my body just went through . That was my experience ! I hope this is helpful too someone ❤️",1,1739541083.0,abortion,1,1.0,False

You once asked me a question  
That women ask to men—  
A silly sort of query,  
But I didn’t answer, then.  


The question was a tough one,  
Designed to make me squirm,  
You said: “would you still love me,  
Even if I was a worm?”  



Well, now that I’ve reflected,  
And thought the whole thing through,  
At last I have an answer,  
I know just what I’d do.  


I’d keep you in my pocket,  
With a big handful of dirt,  
So I could keep you close to me,  
So that you don’t get hurt.  


We’d go on lovely walks,  
And I’d take you to the park,  
Where you could dig down deeply,  
In the filthy, muddy dark.  


We could get a garden,  
And grow our own fruit and veg,  
You’d keep the soil healthy,  
The flowers, lawn, and hedge.  


Perhaps we’d take up fishing,  
And you could be the bait,  
I’d hook us up some dinners,  
A perfect, wormy date.  


And if ever any blackbirds,  
Come sniffing around you,  
Well, I’ll get an air rifle,  
So we can eat those, too.  


You’d be small and pink and squishy,  
And wriggle to and fro,  
Which wouldn’t be too different,  
From the you I’ve come to know.  


So if you awake one morning  
Afflicted by a curse,  
If you’ve crossed a witch or warlock,  
A djinn, or something worse,  


If a science project goes wrong,  
Or a doctor plays a prank,  
If you find yourself shapeshifted,  
From a potion that you’ve drank,  


If you’re transformed into a creature,  
That can only dig and crawl,  
You really shouldn’t worry,  
Because I wouldn’t mind at all.

What if a breakup isn’t a lesson, a stepping stone, or a turning point—but the moment your entire life starts to unravel? For me, it wasn’t just losing a partner; it was losing everything I’d built, every dream I had for the future. And now, I’m left wondering—what if it really doesn’t get better?

  
I understand that people try to find the positives in bad situations, like a breakup, because dwelling on the negatives is unhealthy and doesn’t bring any real change. But what if some breakups truly are a **point of no return**, where the situation is so dire and final that things genuinely won’t get better?

For me, this breakup wasn’t just a fleeting relationship or a high school fling. It wasn’t about ""spending some time together."" It was about building a life—a future with someone I wanted to marry, have kids with, and buy a house with. I spent six years of my life fully committed to that dream, and I truly wasted all these years.

After the breakup, everything in my life fell apart. I got older, started losing my hair, had to move out, accumulated debts, got fired, and eventually had to move back to my home country to live with my parents. I can’t even afford something as small as a coffee. On top of that, my health has declined to the point where I feel seriously ill—like I might have cancer or something equally bad.

I see so many of you trying to stay positive after your breakups, finding meaning in the pain, and looking forward to growth or something better. But for me, this isn’t just another breakup I can move on from. I haven’t learned anything I didn’t already know. There’s no silver lining, no better future waiting for me on the other side of this.

We have a young child. We both work 40 hours a week and I’m also a full time student. I don’t know if I’m over reacting or not because I have a lot of built up resentment due to an uneven balance of household responsibilities so not sure if I’m just mad because of that and this is just something else or if he’s actually being selfish.

So the situation. I take our kid to childcare 3 days out of the week and my husband takes him 2 days. I was taking him the full work week but I finally broke down and asked him to please assist me with getting him where he needs to go so I can sleep in occasionally. I handle all overnight care and since I’ve went back to school this just isn’t working for me. I once again asked him to please help me. Today (ofc it’s Valentine’s Day) is my husband’s day to take him therefore I’m supposed to be able to sleep in a bit before I get up for work. We also have a thing that I started that whoever takes him in the morning sleeps all night and the other handles over night cause they can go back to sleep for an hour. But my husband “can’t” wake up to his alarm so can I please “wake him up at 6” meaning I have to wake him up every day even if our child is screaming through the monitor. Anyways I did the overnight, then our son woke up at 5:30 saying he wanted to eat so I got him up. I went and woke my husband up then got my son some breakfast. After 10 minutes I went back into our room and he’s just sitting there. I’m like what are you doing?? “It’s not 6.” Immediately I’m pissed. I just said well he’s awake now. I go back out. My husband comes back out and I go back to bed. Something happened and our kid is having a meltdown. I hear no comfort words and after 5-10 minutes I get up and just go hold my son until he calms down to tell me what happened. He wanted to help his dad feed the dog and dad did it without him (toddlers, iykyk). So they finally get out the door and it’s 6:47 and I have to be awake in 10 minutes to get ready for work and I didn’t get my sleep in. Idk the whole thing seems to selfish to me. It’s like this all the time. I left the house early to get myself a little coffee treat. Because on top of it all this morning my son and husband woke up to two valentine treats each from me and all I got was irritated. Not a “happy Valentine’s Day” and definitely no treat for me.

This morning, I crept out of bed, held my breath while I made coffee, and didn't hear a sound. I was winning. I began to make my way to the living room, tiptoeing because we have very old, very creaky wooden floors. Not even half-way to the couch I stepped on the loudest board that went ""EEEAAAARRRRRRRT!"" 
Almost as if they had been laying in bed, wide awake, waiting for an opportunity, all four of them came charging out of their room and immediately started asking if they could sit on my lap.

I emailed a lawyer at an office I’d like to work at after they had offered for people to reach out in an information session.

This lawyer is in a different practice area that what I am articling in so I was worried maybe because of that they might not think I have a genuine interest or would waste their time, although I had made sure to note that I had an interest in shared skills across the two practice areas.

 this is a throw away account because my main account promotes my YouTube channel (I want this to be private) my YouTube account isn't big but  we have to be careful 

My (16f) aunt (37f) fat shamed me two hours ago but I'm afraid to tell my mum because of her history with weight. I'm going to give some examples to give an idea before I go to what she said today.

Ever since I could remember I'd see her trying to lose weight we'll call her aunt e . She wears adult diapers because the supplements she takes make her pee herself she once fasted for months only drinking coffee and got really sick and had to stay n the hospital for a while. She has been fired from several jobs because of commenting on customers and her some of her boss' weight. She recently started being a personal fitness instructor and she lost 4/6 clients in a month for making fun of them .

She once told me at 9 YEARS OLD that I looked pregame and I shouldn't wear a my swim suit anymore . When I was  13 she told my best friends mum that my best friend can do better than a fat friend. I've told my mum about the fat shaming and she usually stops for a month before she goes back to it. Avoid her ? I wish she is unemployed and not married so she lives with my grandparents.if I want to see my grandparents I'll have to see her .

I'm starting my first year of university next week Monday and my parents have commitments they can't get out so aunt e has to take me to school. Today I was visiting my grandparents and she brought out a scale and measuring tape and told me I was obese. She told me some one could easily grape me and I'd be pregnant and more fat. She told me to not cry because that's stupid and she told me not to tell my mum then she started crying and hugging me then she left. 

I have no one else to take me to uni and I think she has a problem btw my grandparents were there when she told me these things and they just sat there. Maybe there's nothing wrong and I'd be TA telling my mum

1ipao3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/1ipao3f/i_had_an_odd_dream_involving_unique_new_game/,I had an odd dream involving unique New game+ content,"So to start off: this isn’t some creepypasta or ARG crap nor am I making this up for wierd internet clout. I haven’t played Persona 5 since 2021, I am a huge fan of the game and I still lurk on this sub every now and then, but besides playing Metaphor, the Megami Ten series hasn’t been a part of my life recently. This strange dream including such a unique scenario I thought I share it with this sub

Since I haven’t played the game in years,
It makes this dream I had all the more weirder. To spare you some details, at one point in my dream I was playing Persona 5, but I was replaying the game.

This unique content takes place shortly after ending the Casino Tutorial level, and is an extended version of the dream your first night in the Coffee shop. In this dream: Joker is in an area that is similar to Persona 4’s Fog dream. You wander around briefly, with the butterfly in the beginning you leading you through a labyrinth. At some point an animated cutscene plays, though I don’t remember much of it, but the twist is you meet your party members in this dream much earlier in the game then you normally would. All of the characters are dreaming at the same time you are.

Because this is way before “the Phantom Thieves” are born, the dialogue between the thieves is awkward and has a tense hostility to it. Ann and Ryuji still haven’t reconnected, Makoto still is the “model” honor student, so she has a sense of superiority. In a bit of foreshadowing and sad detail. Futaba refuses to talk and stays mute, but still hides behind Joker. To put it simply, they aren’t friends yet . Despite this, because it’s persona 5, as Joker navigates them through the foggy landscape, each of the characters compliment joker in true Persona 5 fashion. “Wow *character name* you did that so well!” Eventually you come across Morgana, where I remember them calling them a Monster Cat for the first time. He is being chased by a Jack O’ Lantern and asks for assistance. Here you do another tutorial fight where you basically are useless.
Morgana talks to them briefly before a door forms. The door calls for Joker in a haunting tone. He walks inside where a prison uniform and ball and chain forms, besides not waking up in the prison room. The rest of the dream takes place similar to how meeting Igor does in the original.

I don’t know where I am going posting this, but idk does this sound like a plausible new game+ idea? Since you know who the characters are, I thought adding an extra cutscene was a unique idea. Especially because besides the extra fights, new game+ isn’t unique otherwise.",1,1739540039.0,Persona5,1,1.0,False

1ipanun,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ipanun/there_is_someone_in_my_house/,There is someone in my house,"A blanket of stars dominated the night skyline, marinating in the moon’s bright radiance. Thin, gray tendrils of clouds floated effortlessly, sometimes blocking the luminous view perched before me. The scorching summer heat has now cooled down, assisted by a favorable breeze that gently ruffled my twists—allowing me to scan for constellations without sweat blinding my vision. I spotted the Big Dipper in all its glory in the northeast despite partially obstructing it by gray clouds. This discovery did not excite nor deter me since I could always spot the typical constellation somewhere in the night sky. The only thing that changes is the location. That is the fun part, I suppose. The bad part about stargazing is by the time I head home, my eyeballs are sore from the constant straining to spot these patterns of art that shimmered and gleamed with such majestic prowess; I could see why the Cold War involved this radiant void.



I began to feel the soreness in my eyeballs, so I took a quick break from stargazing. I rub my eyes and adjust my position on the tractor. I utilize this moment to scan my surroundings. There is no movement nor suspicious sounds among the army of tall grass that encircled the dirt clearing. Only the occasional gust of wind that sings a song of tranquility I cannot hear but can only see due to the tall grass swaying gently in unison. Elevated by my position on the tractor, I spot my house in the distance. The lopsided cherry brick ranch rested effortlessly on a steep hill. A long, gravel path stretched from the home to the main road. I could see light in the kitchen window if I squinted just enough. 



My heart somersaulted as I realized I had turned off the lights before heading out, an essential step in my security routine when leaving the ranch. I adamantly remind myself to lock the doors, especially the backdoor leading to the backyard. My backyard is about 50 yards long and broader than most. A chicken wire fence maintenance secured the space. As you know, when living in rural places, you are expected to acknowledge that you are a guest and only a guest in the realm of Mother Nature. Over the years, I had my run-ins with wild animals of all kinds. Possums, stray dogs, and even cows have encountered my property several times.



The scariest encounter was when a lone coyote stumbled into my home on a day that felt like the sun was lonely in space and decided to move closer to Earth. I left the back door ajar to let in the cool air because my AC unit malfunctioned. The next thing I knew, I managed to slide my sweaty ass off the couch and was face to face with a lone coyote. I will never forget the silence that hung over us like a foul odor as we had an intense staring contest for what felt like an eternity. The coyote gritted its teeth, producing a low growl, and began to stalk forward a few steps. Despite being rigor mortis from fear, I had the presence of mind to make myself a more prominent target by raising my hands and yelling menacingly. The coyote skittishly backed off, leaving claw marks on the wooden floor as it desperately tried to escape. The startled coyote fled down the backyard and cleared the five-foot chicken wire fence, disappearing into the tall grass. 

  


Recalling this memory distracted me from the dreadful thought of dealing with something other than an animal, alleviating the anxiety and dread I felt as I waded through the tall grass. Silence hung in the air, amplifying the sound of me crushing the gravel beneath my sneakers as I trekked the steep driveway. The light in the kitchen, and only in the kitchen, illuminated the window pane. I stood six feet in front of my house. I reached into the leather holster resting on my right hip and pulled out the revolver. The silver frame glistened under the moonlight. I carefully cocked the pistol and heard a satisfying click. I took a deep breath and pointed the gun right at the front door.



“Whoever is on my property, I am armed and unafraid to shoot. Please come out with your hands up!”I barked fiercely, purposely projecting my voice to sound more threatening. No response came from the house. As every second passed, I felt the anxiety expand within my lungs. I snorted erratically and stood still as a statute,  pistol raised and aiming at the oak door with a death grip despite sweat clinging to my palms. “This is your last warning, or I am coming in.” Again, there was silence. Gathering myself mentally, I prepared to confront whoever was inside my home. 



As I approached the door, the light in the kitchen window suddenly turned off. Then, I heard rapid movement from the kitchen as if the intruder was sprinting toward me. I quickly backed up, more focused than ever, finger resting on the trigger. The sound of footsteps ceased. A small slit of light then shines under the door, and parallel to one another are two lumpy shadows. I suspected the perpetrator was standing before the door, but what I heard next sent chills down my spine. Over the beating of my heart, I heard ragged breathing coming from the door. It sounded more like wheezing as if it needed an inhaler, and each breath was weaker than the last. A foul odor lingered in the air, violating my nostrils. A scent of decay and rot resonated from the door. I grimaced and had to fight my stomach from upheaving the lasagna I had eaten for lunch earlier. Trying to be as rational in such a nerve-wracking situation, I logically guessed it was a homeless man. This thought eased me a little bit, but it still worried me.



Clearing my throat, I calmly and sternly said, “I am calling the police, so do not make this more complicated than it has to be, sir. Just come out and surrender.” I waited for an intelligible response, dreadfully hoping that whatever was in my home was human. My wishes came up short as I heard more sporadic wheezing—no words, just wheezing. The rancid smell grew more potent as time passed, flooding my eyes with tears. I called out again, this time more menacing than the last, but the intruder was not intimidated nor frightened as I heard more wheezing and coughing. 



My mind spiraled with uncontrollable thoughts about the right course of action. Should I call the police and wait it out? Should I take a warning shot to know I mean business? More and more suggestions piled on top of one another, causing my temples to flare in pain. The wheezing grew louder as I congregated with myself, and the smell became almost unbearable. I had no choice but to decide, encouraged by the thought of losing my sanity and harming myself.



I recollected myself and shouted firmly, “You left me no choice.” Despite the nervous jittering of my arms, I steadied my aim at the door. I fixed my eyes on the door, center mass, and pulled the trigger. My ears rang like wind chimes as I felt a shockwave leave my body. In the blink of an eye, the bullet escaped the barrel and exploded through the door, leaving a crater the size of a tennis ball. A hole big enough that I could see that there was nothing there. Just tiny splinters of wood twirling in the air before floating to the ground below. I did not hear any wheezing anymore. The sickening stench was no longer saturating the air, and I could breathe in the fresh air of the land beyond.



Remaining alert, I raised my gun once again and strolled to the front door. I kicked it, and the door slammed against the wall with a thud, revealing nothing: no menacing figure or a distraught homeless man in sight. A shroud of darkness cast serpentine shadows along the walls. I could not see much but could smell. The inescapable aroma of lavender washed over me like a wave. I hoped the scent was potent enough that I would dissociate and not have to be present in such a frightening dilemma. I pressed my free hand against the wall and tried to find the light switch. Eventually, I found the smooth plastic and flicked the knob. A beam of yellow light rained down upon the room.



I then noticed a set of dirty footprints leading to the living room. Whoever was in my home did not have shoes and walked barefoot, fueling the possibility of a random hobo stumbling upon my property to crash for the night. The light above me faintly illuminated most of the living space. I saw my leather sofa facing the coffee table littered with sports magazines and countless lottery scratchers I impulsively bought from the gas station. A flat-screen TV rested above the mantle. I gradually followed the trail into the living room. I meticulously observed each footprint, which began to shrink in size as I continued the trail. This discovery perplexed and frightened me. I gripped the pistol tighter and moved a couple more steps.



It was not until my shoe sank into the living room carpet that the footprints had entirely changed. The footprints were no longer footprints but paw prints of a small animal. I shuddered due to the harsh ice filling my veins, turning my blood cold. It was like the intruder had transformed into an animal mid-step. I immediately shot it down as a possibility and scoffed at the idea, hiding the feelings of fear and dread that rose within me like warm air on a windy day. I squinted my eyes and analyzed the pawprints. Like a light switch, I recognized the tread and pattern of the prints. The pawprints belonged to a coyote. I immediately recall the encounter I experienced not long ago with the stray coyote I found in this room. 

As I stood frozen in thought, a sudden wind massaged the back of my shirt and blew some of the tattered lottery scratch-offs off the coffee table. Startled, I turned around and saw that the back door leading to my yard was slightly ajar. I felt the strange feeling of deja vu creep into my bones. A slosh of mucus obstructed my throat, and I struggled to breathe. I tracked the pawprints from where I was to where it led. The pawprints lead straight to the backdoor. Whatever it was, it seemed it had quietly slipped out and fled into the night, concealed by the starry gloom in the sky above. I hastily shut the door and turned the lock. Mentally and physically exhausted, I plopped onto the sofa and lay my pistol on the coffee table. The adrenaline coursing through my veins was no longer there, and I felt every muscle fiber loosen. I sunk further into the sofa and shut my eyes. My body ached for a soothing Epsom salt bath, but I could not force myself to leave the couch. My eyelids started to get heavy, and I soon voyaged across the outer depths of my consciousness to the tranquil world of slumber.

  


The earsplitting noise of glass shattering shook me awake. I bounced off the sofa with such haste that I nearly tripped myself. I snatched the pistol and aimed the barrel at the backdoor. Something outside had crashed dead center through the window next to it. 



It now rested across the carpet a few feet from where I was—a lifeless heap of mangled orange and grey fur—a rotting corpse of a coyote. My stomach somersaulted, and I struggled not to upheave as the familiar scent of decay returned, potent and more rancid than before. A milky-grey color was present in its eyes. The coyote looked blind or had cataracts. It was missing a paw; instead, exposed flesh and bone occurred. A deep incision ran from its neck to where the tail began. Its bloody entrails and innards sprouted from the gash like a grotesque flower. Tucked into the corner of its snout was a piece of cloth. I covered my mouth and nose with my shirt and retrieved it.



After further review, I discovered it was not cloth but scrap paper—half of it was blood-soaked, and tiny scraps of coyote flesh freckled it. Despite the mess, I could make out letters spelling a single word. A word that raised the hair follicles on the back of my neck and tattooed thousands of goosebumps upon my forearms.

1ipani6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Generator/comments/1ipani6/basic_questions_new_to_generators/,Basic Questions - New to Generators,"Hey - I’m hoping someone can help me out as I’m trying to learn about generators and what I need for my situation. I don’t think I need a full house generator - we don’t loose power very long or often, but it does happen enough and can be disruptive (especially since we WFH). 

Ideally we’d like to have a generator to power critical electronics - 2 fridge/freezers, basic kitchen electronics (coffee maker or maybe something to heat up food quickly), internet router, and charge phones/laptops.

There are a lot of options out there and I want to make sure we get the right solution for our situation. 

I’ve seen some propane powered options which offer a lot of power but will require a transfer line installed (this feels like more than we need??). 

I’ve also seen indoor small, rechargeable generators that maybe could be used just to power a fridge/basic electronics - something like below link. 

https://www.lowes.com/pd/Jackery-Explorer-1000-v2-New-Version-1500-Watts-Portable-Power-Station-1-Solar-Panel-Included/5015301149


Would this be sufficient for our needs or should we really look for the gas powered with a transfer line?
 
Really appreciate any advice or help here. If neither of these options are the right solution, please point me in a different direction.

( contexts: M29 from Switzerland pretty active tore my Achilles Jan 15, full rupture, non-op route. A friend of mine, who is a doctor gave me advice about supplements and nutrition.)

The body is a machine who needs differents nutrients to work and be functional. (Like a car needs Oil, fuel, grease etc etc)
 
Here are advice he told me: 

Protein: Aim for 1.6-2.2g of protein per kilogram of body weight daily to support tissue repair.

Vitamin C: Essential for collagen synthesis. Include citrus fruits, berries, and bell peppers.

Zinc: Found in nuts, seeds, and lean meats, helps with wound healing.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in fish and flaxseed, may reduce excessive inflammation without hindering the repair process.

Collagen Supplements: Taken with Vitamin C 30-60 minutes before physiotherapy (when applicable) may support tendon healing.

 
What i do
I eat more Protein, combine with Vitamine C in the morning with collagen: 

6 eggs, 2 fruits/Vitamine C supplements, Collagen peptide with my coffee, omega 3(fish oil) and vitamine D)

During the day i take my Zinc supplements with a drink (take it 2 3hours after eating, as the assimilation is better with the stomach empty)

Dinner i take Protein shake if i can't eat my protein intake.

Juste before bed i take my magnesium supplements.

There were a surprising number of small tasks that had to be completed before closing a bar for the night. Nettie was efficient, but even so Arthur spent the next half an hour mainly staying awkwardly out of her way. His offer to help was shot down with a polite but firm statement that it was faster to do than to explain. Arthur accepted this truth and simply tried not to be wherever there was a broom, mop or cleaning rag currently in use.

“I’m just down the road,” Nettie said as they finally exited the bar. She already looked different, Arthur noticed. There had always been a professional edge to her smile that he had never really seen until it was no longer there. She still looked happy, but something in her expression made it clear that she now had the option not to be. There was a freedom of choice that had not been present before. “I’ll show you where to park when we get there.”

Outside of her apartment, Nettie paused and turned to Arthur before opening the door. She gave him a deep kiss, letting their bodies linger together for a moment before pulling away.

“I thought this was just about talking,” Arthur said.

“That’s why I did that before we went inside. This might end here. If it does, I want something to remember you by, and vice versa.”

“What do you have in your apartment that you think is going to scare me off?”

Nettie shook her head. “This isn’t about you, not directly. It’s about me seeing your reaction to seeing me.”

“That’s getting layered,” Arthur said.

Nettie opened the door to the apartment. “This is me.”

Her apartment was not crowded, but it was full. Some of it was clutter that had accumulated on the tables, but most of it was intentionally gathered and placed. Shelves along the walls were lined with souvenirs, rocks, photographs and more. Plants grew in large terracotta pots in the corners, tall trees that brushed the ceiling. The vibrant green of their leaves set off the rich browns and crimson reds of the walls and furniture. Although the actual temperature was no different than outside, the room gave the impression of being warm, like a plush chair in front of a roaring fire. Cozy was the word for it. And familiar, though of course none of it was actually familiar to Arthur. The setting made it clear that it was very familiar to someone.

“Water or coffee or anything?” Nettie asked. “My manservant has forgotten to prep the samovar for us, but I can manage a pot of drip.”

“Coffee would be great,” said Arthur. “As long as it’s not going to disrupt your post-work routine too much.”

“Coffee is my post-work routine. I come home, I make a pot, and I drink it while I wind down from the day.”

“You wind down with caffeine?”

“From Venn’s? Absolutely. If I tried to go from that level of bustle to a cold stop, I’d wrench my brain. I need the chemical boost just to help me step down smoothly.”

She waved at a couch. “Sit. The kitchen’s not big enough for two people to be in it. I’ll be back in a minute.”

Arthur sat. The couch was covered in crushed red velvet and was as soft as it looked. The material was worn but well-maintained. It had been in use for many years. Like the rest of the room, it was comfortable. The material was thinnest on the armrest under the reading lamp. Arthur could picture Nettie curled up there, sipping her coffee and reading a book.

He looked at the gathered collection of items, the physicality of a life condensed into one room. He felt like it should remind him of Thaddeus’s shop, all the disparate items vying for attention, but the feeling was completely different. In Thaddeus’s, everything was competing with everything else. Everything wanted to be noticed at the expense of the rest. It was a competition, a violent and vital one. This was cooperation.

The pictures were the other major difference. Almost every other object was a picture frame. Nettie with family. Nettie with friends. Nettie at a party. All of the pictures were of people, and though Nettie was in all of them, she was not the focus of any. These were people she cared about and wanted to remember. They made up the core of her life.

“Trust the author to find the reading spot,” Nettie said, reentering with two mugs. She handed Arthur one. “You get the coffee how I like it, I’m afraid. I can’t be bothered with bringing out a tray with options. Too much mess for too little reward.”

“Leaving your customer service at the bar?”

“Emphatically so. Hosting is very different from serving.”

Nettie settled in next to Arthur on the couch, resting comfortably against him. She took a deep breath, reveling in the smell of the coffee, then relaxed. It felt nice. It felt right. It felt familiar.

The conversation flowed easily, naturally. They talked of their lives, where they had been and where they were going. They told stories about friends, about family, about themselves. They cuddled comfortably against each other and let the night wane around them. When dawn came creeping in the window, Arthur was legitimately startled. He would have sworn that no time had passed at all.

“I have bad news,” he said. “We might be in your evening, but my day’s about to start. I need to be at the office in a little bit. Too late for sleep, I think, but I can probably still fake it with a shower and a shave.”

“Well, thank you for a wonderful evening,” said Nettie, rising from the couch and stretching. “I very much enjoyed winding down with you.”

“Shall we do it again soon?” asked Arthur.

To his shock, Nettie slowly shook her head. “No. I don’t think so.”

“What? Why not?” Arthur was baffled. “What did I do wrong?”

“Nothing. You’ve been sweet and kind and a perfect gentleman. We’re not the right people for each other.”

“But tonight was amazing. You just said it was wonderful.”

“It was. Those can both be true. You’re amazing, Arthur, but you wouldn’t be amazing for me. And I wouldn’t be amazing for you.”

“You can’t know that.”

Nettie shrugged and said nothing.

“Is this about my secret? I’ll tell you if you want to know.”

Nettie physically put a finger to his lips to stop him. “Absolutely not. Not under duress. That’s not sharing. It’s theft.”

She took her hand away. “Anyway, you have told me. You’ve been saying it with every gesture, every date. You say it in the way you look at the world, trying to figure out how to fix it.”

“You think it’s a metaphor,” Arthur said. “The monsters—”

“Reality and metaphor are closer than people like to think,” said Nettie. She took Arthur by the hands. “I’m sorry. I do like you. But this ends here for both of our sakes.”

There wasn’t much else to say to that. Arthur let her escort him to the door. He gave her a hug goodbye, and turned away as the door closed, shutting him out of her life.

“It doesn’t make sense,” he muttered. It didn’t. They were good together. She was understanding of who he was. She would have helped him balance the demands of the Society, kept him anchored as a person. It was the next narratively satisfying step to the story. If he had made a mistake, revealed too much too soon or too little too late, said or done or been something wrong, then fine. But this? She understood it all, she saw it just like him, and she just ended it. Not even before their story began, which would have been fine if disappointing. She dropped everything mid-story.

As Arthur drove, dawn’s burgeoning light broadened out not into a rising sun, but into a general greyness suffusing everything outside of the car. Everything was equally dim and equally lit. The buildings showed no signs of habitation. The streets were abandoned. There was not a light to be seen anywhere.

Art was in the forgotten city.

He did not know how he had gotten here. He certainly knew why.

He parked the car at a curb next to a large plastic tent, the kind erected by scientists for emergency field work in movies. The edges of the plastic were tattered and worn. The thick black drape of an entrance hung heavily in the lack of wind.

Art pushed it aside and entered the spacious interior. It was dozens of yards across, and was set up not for science testing but for what looked like a wedding or similar celebration. The tables were arranged in a semicircle around the central tent pole, which had a small podium set up before it.

Unlike normal, the Gentlefolk were not yet seated and waiting Art’s appearance. They arrived as he did, pushing in through the door or tunneling up from the packed earth or simply folding into being. Seeing them hurry to take their places was almost comical. Art felt a laugh bubbling up from some dark place and stifled it.

The Whispering Man stood at the podium. He nodded to Art.

“In recognition of this advancement, I will tell you a story.”

*What advancement?* Arthur wanted to ask, but he did not dare interrupt. His job was to listen and record. Presumably the Whispering Man would explain in time.

“Listen well. I will tell you of the death of the Whispering Man.”

1ipai8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetPromoted/comments/1ipai8f/getting_ready_to_get_promoted_timetested/,Getting Ready to Get Promoted: Time-Tested Strategies,"Hey everyone,  
Dreaming of that promotion? Here's the deal - while the leadership trends of 2025 lean heavily on accountability and action, some strategies never go out of style. Here's how to gear up for your next big career move:  


1. Exceed Expectations: Always deliver more than what's asked. If your job is to do X, do X+1. This could be staying late to finish a project, offering innovative solutions, or mentoring a colleague. It shows you're not just filling a role; you're enhancing it. Action: Identify one project or task this week where you can go above and beyond.
2. Visibility is Key: Great work in the shadows won't get you promoted. Make sure your contributions are known. Participate in meetings, update your boss on your progress, and share your successes (modestly) with your team. Action: Schedule a quick catch-up with your manager to discuss your recent achievements.
3. Continuous Learning: Show you're invested in your growth. Whether it's taking a course, attending a webinar, or learning a new skill relevant to your job, this showcases your commitment to the company's future. Action: Enroll in one learning opportunity related to your field this month.
4. Build Your Network: Relationships matter. Connect with people across your organization. Not only does this give you allies in different departments, but it also broadens your understanding of the business, making you a more strategic asset. Action: Attend one networking event or setup coffee with someone from another department.
5. Leadership by Example: Even if you're not in a leadership role, lead in your capacity. Take initiative, support your team, and be someone others look up to. Leadership is as much about influence as it is about title. Action: Identify one small leadership opportunity this week, like leading a team meeting or organizing a team-building activity.

Remember, promotions often come to those who not only do their job well but are seen as ready for more responsibility. These steps aren't just about getting promoted; they're about becoming the person who deserves it. Let's make this the year we level up!

I’ve cut out things I thought led to a rapid weight gain in 2021-2022 (like, 20lbs, I assumed it was all the “emotional support Starbucks”). I’ve changed how I eat significantly, including my day-to-day meals. Less take out. Better portion control. No snacks. Better substitutions. I even regain control over my hunger cues. I started swimming laps at least 4x a week.

On paper it’s a lot of progress since August. On the scale and in my clothing fit, it’s nothing.

I haven’t gained weight which is good. And I know what it all means. “You’re not actually at a deficit”, “you’re not actually burning more than you eat”. But I’m so confused because I was 195lbs early in March and often I’d have one-two HUGE sugar bomb coffees a day, I’d get takeout, I’d have bacon with every breakfast, and more. Everyone says “once I cut out the sugar, once I cut this thing out, all the weight just falls out”.

I feel like I’ve made substantial strides in my habits and my relationship with food and my RD has been immense amounts of help. But I feel like I’d at least lost 5-10 pounds by now. If not since August, since November when the habits really started settling in. I was even active and mindful over the holidays.

I’m visiting a small town in Florida and a lot of people eat outside so I look to observe them, and they’re so small. I feel like I see these stick thin people eat huge amounts of food, they get sugary drinks that would be twice the caloric bomb I used to get, they eat cookies without care, they feel like they don’t have to worry at all.

And I just don’t get it. I wish I knew what they have and I don’t have.

I should also mention I struggle severely with food noise even on Concerta (ADHD meds) and even though it’s gotten better, I’ve slowly been learning how to deal with it and how to mitigate its effects.

I don’t want to go on semi-glutides, I really don’t. But I’m starting to see the desperation. I feel like I’m doing everything right. For the first time ever I’m better at portion control than restriction. I have a healthier relationship with food than I ever have and it’s not enough. I just feel like it’ll never be enough and that scares me.",2,1739539472.0,loseit,6,1.0,False

I can only press 'flat white', at which point both lights start flashing for 20 seconds, followed by a constant on of ""descale"" and ""caffe latte"".

However, one evening in the office, she ""just happened"" to be wondering around the office and just happened to find herself on the opposite side of the office where I'm located and stroll into my office. Anyway, I was a little surprised as we barely know each other, as she kinda just strolled in and asked how I am etc and wanting to see how things are and make conversation. Then just says to me that we should go and grab a coffee together after work one evening. I guess this is a good sign she may be interested somewhat? Or is she just being friendly and wanting to get to know me and make a new friend..who knows.

Anyway, fast forward like a month or so later. Whenever we speak in the office, she is always inviting me to have lunch with her that day (one on one, no other colleagues). Been to lunch a few times with her now, it's always just the two of us no other colleagues were invited it seems. I'm guessing I'm just a friend she enjoys speaking/hanging out with or she is interested.

1ipad9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiderealAstrology/comments/1ipad9i/arudha_lagna_in_different_houses_and_how_others/,Arudha lagna in different houses and how others view you," First of all ""Arudha"" is a Sanskrit word that means 'Half'.  Well, Arudha Lagna is not your true personality but this is the personality which people think of you. This is how you appear in the Maya world, in the materialistic world of money and power.

How to calculate it:- Look at what house your ascendant lord (Lagna Lord) is placed and count the number of houses apart it is situated from your first house(Lagna). Counting is to be done along with the placement of the zodiac signs in their correct order. 
Now go the same number of places forward from the house where your Lagna lord is placed and that is your Arudh Lagna.

1st house:-  If your Arudha falls in the first house, others perceive you as an energetic and impulsive individual who prioritizes fitness and physical appearance. Your charming and magnetic personality naturally draws people to you. You're often viewed as a risk-taker, prone to acting on instinct without deliberating extensively. This trait may lead others to believe that you'd excel as an entrepreneur or in sports, leveraging your passion and talent to achieve success in your chosen hobby or pursuit.



2nd house:-  If your Arudha falls in the 2nd house, others may perceive you as someone who prioritizes discussion over action, often focusing on talk rather than tangible results. Please note that this is merely their perception, not necessarily reflective of reality. Additionally, people may view you as someone with a penchant for fine food, jewelry, and impeccable fashion sense. Your tendency to indulge in self-care and personal spending might lead others to see you as somewhat self-centered. However, it's also acknowledged that you possess a natural talent for managing finances and accumulating wealth. Your voice and unique style often command attention, and you're perceived as an adept negotiator, capable of brokering seemingly impossible deals through your articulate and persuasive communication.



3rd house:-  If your Arudha falls in the 3rd house, others tend to perceive you as a vibrant and effervescent personality. You come across as talkative and youthful, with a somewhat playful demeanor that may be misinterpreted as immaturity. Your romantic and affectionate nature is evident, as you delight in sentimental gestures, such as coffee dates, movie nights, and frequent travels. People admire your exceptional research skills and are drawn to your remarkable talents, which might include dancing, public speaking, writing, astrology, or singing. However, your exuberance can sometimes be perceived as irritating or annoying. Nevertheless, your quick wit and good sense of humor often help to diffuse any tension and leave a lasting impression



4th house:- If your Arudha falls in the 4th house, others perceive you as a private and secretive individual, fiercely protective of your personal life. Despite close relationships, you're cautious about sharing intimate details, maintaining a sense of reserve. You feel most at ease within the comfort of your family and home, and tend to be selective about opening up to others. Nevertheless, you're content with your own company and possess a caring, intuitive nature. Your ability to offer sage advice is valued, and while you may not readily share your own belongings, others find solace in confiding in you about their personal lives.



5th house:-  If your Arudha falls in the 5th house, others regard you as exceptionally intelligent, possessing a profound and detailed understanding of various subjects. Your vast knowledge and intellectual prowess can effortlessly captivate others, making you a compelling leader with a natural ability to influence people. However, this perception also has a flip side: others may view you as arrogant and egoistic, someone who tends to dominate and control others. Despite this, people acknowledge your hidden talents and believe you have the potential to excel as a teacher, mentor, or guide. Your innate leadership qualities and natural charisma make you a born leader, capable of inspiring and guiding others.



6th house:- If your Arudha falls in the 6th house, others perceive you as an analytical individual who tends to be reserved and cautious in opening up to others. You're seen as practical, grounded, and responsible, but also prone to being overly critical of others, often demanding perfection while acknowledging your own imperfections. Your competitive nature can evoke jealousy in many, and your argumentative streak, fueled by your reliance on logic and facts, may lead others to view you unfavorably. This intense focus on rationality can be off-putting to those who prefer a more emotional or intuitive approach. Furthermore, people may see you as either extremely health-conscious or completely indifferent to conscious eating.



7th house:-  If your Arudha falls in the 7th house, others perceive you as a diplomatic individual, adept at navigating complex situations without taking sides. They may view you as judgmental, although this is merely their perception, not necessarily an accurate reflection of your character. You're seen as having a keen business mind and a distinctive physical attribute that captures attention, such as striking eyes or exceptional hair. People believe you possess a natural charm that effortlessly attracts the opposite sex, and you may even have secret admirers. While others admire your sophistication and impressive social skills, which enable you to effortlessly draw crowds, they may also harbor reservations about your trustworthiness due to your sociable nature, fearing that you might inadvertently reveal their personal secrets.


8th house: - If your Arudha Lagna falls in this house, people unequivocally view you as an enigmatic and intuitive individual. They may also perceive you as frugal, regardless of whether this trait accurately describes you. You're seen as clever, introverted, and possessing exceptional intuition. However, others believe you struggle with emotional balance, experiencing unpredictable mood swings and difficulty controlling your emotions. People also associate you with a strong interest in occult sciences or a natural talent for them. Additionally, they admire your in-depth knowledge of a particular subject, as well as your sharp wit and discerning judgment. According to others, you possess the ability to read people through their facial expressions. They also view you as charismatic, magnetic, and possessing a strong sensual presence. Furthermore, people believe you have a knack for navigating risky financial ventures, such as the stock market or cryptocurrency, and demonstrate a natural aptitude for finance.


9th house:- If your Arudha Lagna falls in the 9th house, others perceive you as an exceptionally fortunate individual. Please note that this is their perspective, which may not always align with reality. You're seen as a devout and spiritual person, with a deep love and reverence for the divine. Your inherent purity earns you a reputation as a trustworthy individual among those around you. Your curiosity drives you to explore diverse cultures, and you're always eager to acquire new knowledge. You possess a remarkable ability to offer insightful advice at precisely the right moment. Travel, particularly to foreign destinations or on extended trips, is a passion of yours, as is engaging with people from different cultural backgrounds. You enjoy discussing history, religion, languages, and spirituality, and have a thirst for adventure. While your vast knowledge is admirable, your tendency to offer unsolicited advice can sometimes be perceived as annoying. Additionally, people may notice a distinctive foreign element in your appearance, mannerisms, or habits, such as your accent, hair color, or eye color.


10th House: - If your Arudha falls in the 10th house, others perceive you as an ambitious and career-driven individual, primarily focused on your professional image, finances, and long-term success. You're seen as a serious and driven person who prioritizes commitment and stability in relationships, rather than casual romantic entanglements. You maintain a professional demeanor, avoiding gossip and unnecessary drama, which can sometimes lead others to view you as aloof. Your high standards and relentless pursuit of excellence may give the impression that you're selfish and status-conscious, constantly seeking recognition and validation. Nevertheless, your exceptional organizational skills and dedication to your work are undeniable.


11th house:- If your Arudha falls in the 11th house, others perceive you as a charismatic individual with exceptional social skills, effortlessly connecting with people from diverse backgrounds, including foreigners. You're seen as an outgoing and sociable person who thrives in party environments and gatherings. Your materialistic side is also apparent, and you're believed to be adept at learning and speaking multiple languages, as well as possessing technical expertise. You're viewed as someone who stays up-to-date with the latest trends, but also spends an inordinate amount of time on your phone. While you're perceived as laid-back and averse to staying at home, others also view you as dishonest and prone to gossiping, often unintentionally sharing confidential information. Additionally, people may see you as someone who achieves fame and gets what you want without much effort, and who frequently daydreams. Your talent and interpersonal skills can make you more popular than those around you. However, it's also possible that others see you as someone who presents a false image, hiding your true nature.


12th house :- If your Arudha Lagna falls in the 12th house, others perceive you as someone who is laid-back and inclined to surrender to divine fate, rather than taking proactive steps. This nature of yours often leads people to view you as superstitious or a blind follower. You're seen as someone who can spend an entire day in quiet contemplation or rest, seeking truth and authenticity in all aspects of life. While you may struggle with social skills, particularly in business settings, your pure heart and spiritual wisdom make you an inspiring motivational speaker. You tend to attract mature individuals, rather than those of your own age or younger. Your exceptional intuition and spiritual knowledge are considered your greatest strengths, and people believe that these qualities bring positive experiences into your life.


Note:- This is about how others view you, so do not get triggered by the negative points, Arudha lagna is our image not the actual reality. check from signs also eg. First house/Aries sign.

You were in the Coffee Table Reads aisle while I was browsing the Award Winners section. I caught you staring at me. We ended up chatting with each other for hours and spilling our guts out - it was truly a magical day. 


You asked me out but I said no - mostly because I wasn't ready to date anyone and I also had this feeling that you're gonna break my heart one day. My answer didn't faze you at all - you said it would be an honor to be a part of my life, in whatever capacity I deemed fit. 

From there on, we became friends who talked day in and day out. You saw me for who I was and listened - I had never felt more peaceful in my life. 

Like it always happens with most friendships I give my all in - you slowly disappeared. I tried to bribe you back into my life - sent you handwritten letters and books which were in your Goodreads list. Nothing mattered - you were gone just like that. I would give anything to get some sort of closure from you - I just want to know what you're doing and how you are feeling. 

I want to run my fingers through your hair once, speak to you over the phone and laugh loudly. I want to know if you're thinking about me today. I want to know if you ever catch yourself dreaming about me like I do. 

You were the best person I had ever known, I wish I had met you when we were in college. I want to hug you and ask you to be my best friend forever. I want to be a part of your life so badly. I can't believe you stopped speaking to me. 


I always think back to our conversations and wonder what I did wrong to push you out of my life. Did I overshare? Did I say something to make you uncomfortable? Did you find a person who could be a better friend to you?  

I'm so tired of waiting for you.

In *Will of the Unyielding,* Earth is thrust into a system apocalypse, catapulting humanity into a crisis that will upend not only man-made laws but also the very fabric of nature itself.

This story combines some elements of **kingdom building**, **sci-fi**, and **cultivation** in a predominantly **LitRPG Progression** narrative. Set against the backdrop of a vast and diverse universe teeming with civilizations—some far more advanced than Earth, others still developing—it follows a journey of growth, power, and discovery in the face of cosmic challenges.

Humanity must unite to face relentless external threats, with the survival of the species hanging in the balance.

At the heart of this story is a determined MC whose journey is shaped not only by personal strength but also by the bonds forged with a close group of friends. While this is not a multiple-lead novel, each supporting character plays a pivotal role, driven by their own motivations, ambitions, and personalities. Their individual stories will intertwine to create a rich narrative tapestry that tests their limits and reshapes their futures.

The MC carries a singular, burning goal—one that was stolen from him the moment he was born. Now, with the onset of the apocalypse, he finally has the chance to reclaim what was lost.

However, when faced with a harsh and unexpected reality, his goal evolves—or rather, it expands into something far greater. What was once taken from him is now ripped away from the aliens, setting the stage for a clash of wills, survival, and destiny.

Prepare for intense conflict, galactic intrigue, and an exploration of Humanity’s will to endure. Will Earth’s spirit be enough to survive—or even triumph—against a Universe that wants to see it fall?



**Chapter 1: Beginning**

 

***I still remember that day.***  
***The day everything changed.***

 

It was the 7th of April, 2159, a sunny day.  
The kind of day that lures you outside, where the warmth of the sun feels like a gentle embrace. A young man was jogging through the quiet streets of his neighbourhood.

He looked to be about 20 years old, around 1.90m with short black hair and an athletic physique. His deep blue eyes, often lost in thought, had a peculiar intensity, as if he were constantly searching for something just out of reach.

The sun beat down on him, the golden rays reflecting off nearby windows and casting long shadows on the pavement. There was something peaceful about the morning, but a tension hung in the air, like something waiting to happen.

As he passed by a convenience store, he slowed to a stop, intending to grab something for breakfast. The rhythmic sound of his sneakers on the pavement had gradually slowed to a soft patter as he approached the glass door. A faint smell of coffee and fresh bread wafted into his nose, and his stomach growled louder than before, reminding him of the hunger he had yet to satisfy.

He glanced down at the shop’s entrance, expecting to see the usual “Open” sign glowing, but instead, there was a simple, blunt “Closed” posted in big red letters. A sigh escaped his lips.

“What a pain” he muttered under his breath.

The streets around him were oddly quiet. Usually, even at this hour, there were people out and about—getting their morning fixes or hurriedly heading to work. But today, all that could be heard was the faint breeze rustling the leaves of nearby trees.

He instinctively reached for his phone to check the time, his fingers brushing the cold glass screen before pausing. Maybe everyone else was just still at home, taking their time, not like him, hurrying for breakfast.

He decided to try his luck elsewhere, but shop after shop, they all bore the same sign: “Closed.” His stomach growled even louder now, demanding his attention. As he walked past another store with the shades drawn, it dawned on him what might be going on.

“Ahh, it’s because of that game the Federation is announcing today” he realized, his mind quickly jumping to the upcoming event. Ever since the Federation’s announcement that the new game God’s Path would be launching, it had taken over every conversation, every forum. It felt like the whole world had paused to wait for it. People stayed home to tune in, whether they’d ever played games in their life or not. No work today, no commerce—just focus on the game.

His stomach gave another impatient rumble. ‘I’ll starve if nobody works today... Maybe I’ve got some snacks left at home?’  
After a moment of indecision, he decided to turn back and head home.

It wasn’t far—a short jog back to his apartment. The neighbourhood was still as quiet as before, the world almost serene as it held its breath in anticipation of what was to come.

He lived alone in a small apartment in a sprawling complex. It wasn’t much—just 50 square meters—but it was enough for one person, and that suited him just fine. His personal belongings were few. A basic bed, a worn sofa, a tiny desk piled with old martial arts books, and, of course, his device.

He’d managed to scrape by, working mostly online, never really needing much. His official status on the Federation’s record was “unemployed” but that didn’t bother him much; the Federation provided enough to get by. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for his needs.

As soon as he stepped through the door, he kicked off his sneakers and started shedding his clothes as if they were weights. His eyes wandered across the apartment as he entered—a sparse room filled with just enough to get by. ‘A real cozy existence’ he mused. His stomach growled again.

Walking straight for the bathroom, he threw his clothes haphazardly across the floor. The apartment wasn’t messy by any means, but there was definitely an almost lived-in quality to it—like he was only passing through life, just moving along. He didn’t want to linger too long. Today was the day the Federation had hyped up for months.

But as he stood under the warm stream of the shower, he realized something. His stomach wasn’t going to wait. The excitement, the chaos building around the God’s Path game, couldn’t stop his appetite from gnawing at him. With a huff, he rinsed the soap from his body and turned off the water.

His thoughts briefly flickered to food. Food would help, at least give him the energy to enjoy the broadcast. He dried off quickly, threw on some comfortable clothes—clothes that matched his lifestyle. Clothes for the lazy, the ones with no particular plans, except today. His stomach growled in agreement.

With a sigh, he walked into the kitchen, his bare feet padding against the cool tile. The fridge door opened with a familiar creak, and he scanned the contents for something worth his time. He pulled out a carton of milk, gave it a quick shake to test its freshness, then decided against it. Too boring. His gaze shifted to the shelves, where the real potential lay. He opened a cabinet, peering into the depths. After a few moments, his hand landed on a half-open bag of chips and a nearly empty jar of peanut butter.

Sighing again—this was the state of his food situation—he grabbed the jar, dipped a spoon into it, and took a generous scoop. The smooth peanut butter coated his tongue in a familiar, comforting way. Simple, effective, and enough to take the edge off his hunger. He pulled a nearby chair to the counter and sat down, spoon in hand, as he absentmindedly surveyed the empty space around him, his thoughts drifting.

After a few more spoonfuls, he wiped the excess from the spoon and stood, feeling satisfied enough to return to his original mission. He left the kitchen behind, jar and spoon still in hand, and shuffled back toward the couch. The faint glow of his handheld device, now turned on and ready for the live broadcast, illuminated the room.

He grabbed his handheld device and plopped down on the sofa, staring blankly at the dull walls before switching on the live broadcast of the Federation’s official announcement.

There was something oddly unenthusiastic in his approach to this event. Everyone was talking about it. But for him? It felt just like another viral sensation that would fade out after a few weeks. Sure, the grandiose promises of the game intrigued him, but there was just so much skepticism. How many “revolutions” had the Federation promised only to deliver failure? How many “breakthroughs” ended up being nothing more than profit-driven schemes? The game’s premise sounded ridiculous anyway. Godhood? A far-fetched fantasy dreamed up by marketers, perhaps.

On the screen, an austere news anchor, standing in front of a towering, shiny structure—sleek, futuristic, almost awe-inspiring—spoke with somber intensity.  
“It’s been fifty years since we first intercepted a signal from beyond our solar system” he started.

The moment the anchor’s voice hit the airwaves, the man tilted his head, blinking a few times in surprise. The report was familiar—it had made it into the history books.

“Huh, yeah, I remember reading about that” he mumbled to himself. “It was a huge deal. Back then, it felt like the world was about to change. Scientists and researchers went nuts over it. Those guys probably haven’t slept since.”

The anchor's gaze remained steady as he continued. “This signal contained knowledge—technology far beyond anything we’ve ever dreamed of.”

He yawned, picking up his snack. “Will I get my food faster with this?”

He turned his attention back to the screen.

“This knowledge is what led to the creation of the game launching today—God’s Path. This is no simple entertainment. This is evolution in its purest form. And it’s a game that will change humanity.” The anchor’s voice rose in a fever pitch. “The Federation has verified every claim, and I’m here to tell you what’s coming— it is real. And soon, we will be transformed.” The man paused, gasping as if the weight of his own words were catching up with him. He reached for a glass of water. The sudden break felt… awkward, almost forced.

The man on the sofa, meanwhile, was unimpressed. ‘Godhood, huh?’ he mused. “Maybe I’ll become the Thief God and start stealing everyone’s money and watch the whole world burn. Hahaha.” He chuckled at his own joke, not taking any of it seriously or maybe he just didn’t care.

Then the anchor, after another sip, drew in a breath, clearly trying to regain composure. “With the help of this signal, scientists constructed the Universal Tower. A monumental achievement. This tower will connect our world to the vast universe. And…soon…” the anchor had to take in several mouthful of air “s-soon Humanity will receive a notification…a notification that will bring us closer to Godhood.” The reporter finally couldn’t take it anymore and started gulping water on live stream.

‘So we’re all playing pretend in some space fairy tale’, the man thought dismissively, taking a bite of his snack. ‘Wasn’t that the same rhetoric that corporations spewed every time they launched a new product? Another promise of better futures, gods, heroes, immortality’. He chuckled dryly.

A sudden pause in the broadcast caught him off-guard. As the anchor readied himself for another grand statement, the man was interrupted by a flash of light across his screen—a notification lighting up with Jack’s name.

“Jack—” he said aloud before being drowned out by Jack’s shouting over the call.

“MAN, DID YOU SEE THE NEWS??? THIS IS FIRE!” Jack was practically yelling.

“Yeah, Jack, I saw. I had a feeling you’d be pumped about it. You’re getting way too excited already” He responded flatly.

“Do you already know what kind of God you want to become?” Jack shot out immediately. “The web’s already flooded with ideas and it’s only been five minutes!”

“I was about to call you, you know.” The man muttered, running a hand over his face. ""You and your over-excited plans."" He caught himself almost smiling. Sometimes, he felt like Jack never grew up. He had known this friend of his since his childhood and even now, Jack had always been a child at heart, in some ways. “Actually, I had this idea—I’ll be the Thief God” he said, throwing his hands in the air, as if imagining it already. “Can you imagine? The perfect crime, except it's me, walking away from everyone else's stuff. That’s a real God!”

Jack groaned audibly on the other end. “Wait, hold up! A Thief God?! Really?” He paused, his incredulity only growing. “Come on, man, why settle for a thief when you can be something much bigger?”

  
“How much bigger?” He asked, raising an eyebrow. ""What do you propose, then?""

Jack didn’t hesitate. “If this is anything like an RPG, we have the chance to become the strongest beings in the universe!” Jack ranted, his excitement evident. “It’s not just about playing with powers, we’ll have the control over it all! Thief God, Federation, none of that will matter! Imagine everything in our grasp!”

The man's mind whirred as he thought about it. He didn’t buy into all of Jack’s ideas. Was it even possible? But the way Jack laid it out made him second-guess things. Would this game, for all its crazy promises, really give them god-like powers?

With a smirk, He broke his silence. “Okay, Jack, say we could be the strongest—how the hell do you know? For all we know, this whole game could be a scam, just some government experiment. Remember, they’ve screwed us over in the past.” He sighed, his words landing like lead. He stared out at the bland horizon.

“You’ve never played a real RPG, have you?” Jack shot back.

“Dude, you know I'm not into that stuff.” He snapped. “What good is knowing how to level up stats?”

Jack’s voice sounded smug. “Stats, man! You increase your stats, you break everything! And maxed stats? That means we become invincible. Literally the strongest beings in the universe, if it works like the games!”

The man considered it. ‘It could be fun’ he thought. ‘But still, a part of me feels like this is all going to fall apart the minute the notifications go live.’

Right then, something strange happened.

The ground beneath him trembled, a deep, lazy rumble that finally forced him to look up from his snack. He frowned, annoyed as loose objects fell from the shelves, clattering to the floor. ""Ugh"" he muttered, eyes darting to the window where the light outside had gone… weird.

Through the glass, he saw it—a blazing beam of light erupting from the Universal Tower, punching straight into the sky. He scratched his head, uninterested for a moment, before the vivid colors spilling across the clouds caught his attention. White, green, blue, purple—they churned and rippled in chaotic patterns, and then there was orange. A heavy, unsettling orange that hung like a bad omen.

He squinted. ""Huh. Looks like they’re going all out with the theatrics."" He leaned against the wall, unconcerned as his devices flickered, sparked, and died. The silence that followed was broken only by the faint hum of energy vibrating through the air.

With an exaggerated sigh, he pushed himself to his feet and sauntered toward the window. Outside, the sky continued its bizarre transformation, and the Universal Tower pulsed with alien patterns. It was impressive, sure, but he still wasn’t sold on the whole Godhood thing.

And then he heard it—the voice. It was deep, echoing, and lodged itself somewhere uncomfortable in his brain:

**\[System initialization complete.\]**

“Well…” He muttered, watching the window’s chaotic brilliance, his tone mocking the impossible to come. “If this is the path to Godhood, I might as well enjoy the ride.""

***And so…it began.***

Este café é originário da região de Tres Pontas, no Brasil, e é processado pelo método natural,  de torra média-escura. Inicialmente puxava muito para o chocolate negro amargo. Estava a extrair a 9 bar em 28s com o IMS Big Bang (1:2), mas não gostava muito do perfil—demasiado intenso e amargo.

Decidi testar uma pré-infusão de 15s a 2 bar, seguida de 7 bar até atingir a proporção 1:2 em cerca de 30s. O resultado? As notas de chocolate negro tornaram-se mais suaves e menos agressivas, e surgiu uma acidez subtil, tipo cerejas escuras descritas no pacote, tornando o café mais equilibrado e agradável para o dia-a-dia.

Ainda não sei se este perfil de extração é o ideal, mas gostei bastante do resultado.

PS: Com os mesmos settings e mudando somente o cesto para o de stock (IMS 18g) que veio com a Lelit só conseguia extrair umas gotas e ficava ""entupido"". Mesmo moendo mais grosso (cheguei a ter uma diferença de 10 clicks na Philos)  o resultado continuava o mesmo. Primeira vez que me aconteceu. ",1,1739538441.0,cafept,0,1.0,False

Lyon, a city where history whispers from every cobblestone, offers a fascinating journey into its past. And no place captures this better than the Confluence Museum.  Located at the dramatic meeting point of the Rhône and Saône rivers – the very ""confluence"" that gives the museum its name – this architectural marvel houses an engaging exploration of Lyon's story, from its Roman origins to its modern-day vibrancy.

# 1. Bullet Journal Like You’re a Victorian Detective 📓

*“Dear Diary, today I drank coffee, cried over Excel, and hyperfixated on a 17th-century candle-making tutorial.”* Track *everything*. Moods, water intake, that weird mole. Bonus points if your spread includes conspiracy theories about where your motivation went.

# 2. The Pomodoro Technique (But With Snacks) 🍅

Work 25 minutes. Reward yourself with 5 minutes of existential dread **or** a fistful of gummy bears. Repeat until you’ve either finished your project or achieved a sugar coma. *Pro tip:* Replace the timer with “I’ll stop when my will to live does.”

# 3. Productivity™ Apps Are a Cult (Join Anyway)

Download every app promising “life-changing efficiency.” Spend 4 hours setting up filters, themes, and synced calendars. Use them once. Feel shame. Delete all. Return to scribbling tasks on your hand like a medieval peasant.

# 4. ”Deep Work” = Ignoring Your Existence 🧘♂️

Lock yourself in a sensory deprivation tank (read: closet) and “focus.” Emerge 3 hours later with carpal tunnel and a single email draft. Congratulate yourself for “adulting.”

# 5. Hustle Culture is a Pyramid Scheme 🔺

You don’t need to monetize your sleep. If “waking up at 5 AM” was vital, owls would rule the world. *Side effects of rejecting grind culture:* Mild panic, sudden urge to knit socks.

# 6. Self-Care is Just Reparenting Yourself 🛁

Replace “productivity” with “eating a vegetable” or “staring at a plant.” Light a candle. Pretend you’re in a wellness ad. Whisper, “I’m enough” until your imposter syndrome files for unemployment.

# 7. Embrace the Power of Cheugy Goals ✨

Learn to yodel. Adopt a cactus. Start a podcast about *The Sims* lore. “Productivity” is fake—do weird stuff that makes your inner child clap.

**TL;DR:** Life’s a dumpster fire—optimize for joy, not jargon. Your to-do list can wait. Go touch grass (or at least a houseplant).

**P.S.** If this advice stresses you out… good. Chaos is my brand. 🙃

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

She spent holidays with me and my family, she has a whole second set of doggie items at my home. We suddenly lost her Wednesday after she broke a leg due to unknown osteosarcoma. Her human and I are grieving her, and I wanted to share some sweet and silly photos of this girl. 

I never knew a dog could be so good and so smart. She learned my own way of communicating with her, walked like a dream on a leash, was fully non reactive and happily padded into any house, coffee shop, book store, and rubbed on everyone for love. I can only hope if I ever have my own dog that they are 75% of what Delilah was.

I work as an ERP consultant, yet I know nothing about the work I do, and no one really teaches me how to do it. People at my workplace are divided based on language, which makes it even harder to connect with anyone.

I have been in a relationship for the past two years, but it has been a constant struggle to have a normal relationship. Her mother never allowed me to meet her, and she always sided with her mother. We would constantly fight, and by the time her mother finally approved of our relationship, the love between us had already faded. Now, we are set to marry soon, but I feel like there is nothing left in this relationship. I find myself attracted to other women or wishing I could be with someone else. But since this relationship has gone too far, I can’t take a step back. So even my relationship isn’t a happy one.

I am struggling with financial issues. Each month, within a few days, all my money is gone in EMIs, loans, and bills. I have a dog who destroys everything in my home, from the bed to the sofa. I eat only once a day because I can't afford two meals. I survive on coffee, juice, and soup, thanks to my office's free food policy.

Each day at work, I do nothing and feel like I am wasting my time. At home, I have nothing to do because everything is a mess. I don’t have money to go out. I feel like leaving everything behind and just disappearing.

Most of the time, I think about ending my life. I have even planned out how I would do it. I am living a life that most people dream of, yet I feel like it’s not worth living. I won’t take any such step, at least not for now. I still watch the sunset and birds flying high in the sky, but I feel nothing.

A few days ago, I met with an accident, yet I felt nothing. I wasn’t happy or sad—I just wanted to sit there and do nothing. Maybe I am dying inside, little by little, every day.

I guess it's true—a person who takes their own life is already dead inside. I wonder if I will see that day soon.",1,1739537736.0,u_Novel_Flow_4743,0,0.99,False

Today I was dropped off back home to find the door from the garage into the house was locked and NH didn’t answer my knocking. I realized he had once again locked me out and then gone to bed for a nap.  There is a key in the garage but my vision makes it difficult to find, and it was 10 degrees F outside making it extra challenging.  I was angry as I had asked, demanded and yelled about him not doing this.  So I took the car and drove to a coffee shop to wait (I drive minimally due to my vision).  I decided that since appealing to his common sense hadn’t worked, I’d make a statement by returning home about 5 minutes later than he usually left for work. Since he leaves 15 minutes early, this would not make him late but would get his attention.  I came home to an unlocked door but also his verbal meltdown where he was screaming at me that I was a bitch and how there were zero problems for me when he locks me out, etc.  I didn’t yell back or name call but said in response that he not lock me out again.  I repeated it several times in response to his minimizing my predicament (you could find the key, you’re a bitch, you’re lazy).  He shouted that I was a bitch once more as he ran out the door.  So was I the cause? Unreasonable?  Bully?  I’m not a bitch but a person with MS and partial blindness who asks for very little help from him.  One other note is he doesn’t lock doors or even check to see if they are locked so I don’t believe he accidentally locked it from muscle memory.  ",1,1739537530.0,NarcissisticSpouses,2,1.0,False

It was almost Halloween. Leafless tree branches swayed in the crisp breeze. The grey overcast sky hinted at yet another day of rain. Yellow-grey cornstalks flitted past and dead leaves scattered as the big, brown Buick carried us down the empty country road.

I looked forward to seeing Granny, even if she would be working most of the time I was staying with her. Grandpa agreed to watch me during the daytime. He received a stipend from a back injury he received in the army. It wasn’t much, but between the monthly check and Granny working it was enough. He always enjoyed the company. He would tell me stories about his time in the army and he knew the funniest jokes I ever heard. When he did his daily chores like cleaning the house, he let me explore the empty fields and small woods near their house. I looked forward to trying to find arrowheads, playing on hay bales, climbing trees… Maybe not that last one.

The only downside to my visit was I had to spend it with my cousin, Kasey. My grandparents became her legal guardians after her mom left. Mom and dad never explained where she went. I always worried she might have gone to jail or ended up like those people on Unsolved Mysteries. I might have felt sorry for Kasey if she didn’t bully me whenever the adults weren’t around.

“We’re only going to be gone three days for this business retreat, so I expect you to behave yourself.” Dad looked at me in the rearview mirror. “I don’t want you in the hospital again.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll be good.”

Mom turned in her seat to face me. “If you’re a good boy, maybe we’ll bring you back a present for good behavior. You’ll make sure he’s good, won’t you Teddy?” She held my stuffed bear and made him nod his head like a puppet. I was old enough to know Teddy wasn’t doing it himself, but I played along.

“Teddy gets a present too, right? For good bear-haviour?”

Mom smiled before turning around. “Of course, sweetie.”

The once smooth, quiet ride suddenly became rough and loud as dad’s car transitioned from pavement to the dirt and gravel leading the rest of the way to my grandparents’ house. Granny would take me on long walks down this stretch of road, and I would look for little round rocks she called “Indian Beads”. I showed some to my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Smith and she told me they were actually fossils from a prehistoric plant.

As we came to a stop at a four-way intersection I noticed the abandoned house on the corner. It was the only neighboring house to my grandparents for miles. Most of the year it was completely hidden from view by the trees and overgrown vines covering the chain link fence. Even now, after many of the leaves had fallen, I couldn’t distinguish much other than the chipping paint and wrap-around porch. A few windows on the upper floor peered over the trees, their screens torn and shutters unsecured.

“Somebody really ought to fix that place up.” Mom said.

“Too late for that,” Dad said. “The roof is caved in. It’s not safe.”

“That’s a shame. It must be over a hundred years old.”

After the fence row to the abandoned house, an empty field came into view. It probably belonged to whoever owned the house, but the only thing that grew in it were clusters of Indiangrass, cattails, and most notably, a massive oak tree in the center of the field. It was so big two grown-ups couldn’t reach all the way around it. Several of the limbs were low enough I could reach them without any help. I nearly forgot all the fun we had playing in this field when I realized my grandparents’ house was coming into view.

Grandpa was smoking a cigarette on the front porch as we pulled up. He was jolted from some reverie as Maggie, the black lab shot up and barked, wagging her tail. The car wasn’t even parked before I bolted out the door.

“Grandpa!” I ran to hug him. I nearly knocked him over. He laughed as he steadied himself on the porch railing. A tube of grey cinders fell from the tip of his cigarette as he laughed.

“What are they feeding you, Bucko? You get bigger every time I see you.”

I shrugged, and he let out another loud laugh. “You know what? I got some cartoons recorded for you!”

“Really?” We only got local channels at my house. The only cartoons were the ones on PBS, and that was only when they weren’t broadcasting boring home repair shows.

He smiled. “Your grandma left the videotapes next to the TV for you.”

Mom and Dad came up to the porch, Dad with the suitcase, Mom with Teddy. Grandpa bent down to whisper something to me. “I hid something for you under your pillow.”

“Really? What is it?”

“Don’t you spoil the boy, dad,” Mom handed me Teddy.

“Spoil him? It’s Halloween isn’t it Johnny?”

“Uh-Huh!”

“Well, we hate to drop him off and run, but we do need to get going.” My dad looked at his watch. “Johnny, you behave now.”

“I will.”

I hugged my parents goodbye. They waved as they backed out of the driveway and pulled onto the road. The big brown car slowly vanished in a cloud of dust. I picked up my luggage and went inside.

“I’ll be in there in a few minutes,” Grandpa said, settling into the lawn chair and sipping his coffee. “I just want to finish this newspaper article.”

I walked through the living room and saw the VHS tapes just like grandpa said. One of the labels read “Speed Racer”. I couldn’t wait to watch them. When I got to the guest bedroom, I set my suitcase on the floor next to the bunk bed. Kasey always slept in the top bunk which left me on the bottom. I set Teddy down and reached under the pillow. To my surprise there was nothing. Confused, I moved the pillow and found the spot underneath was bare. I looked under the bed thinking maybe whatever Grandpa left for me had fallen on the floor.

“Looking for this?” Kasey was hanging upside down from the top bunk. She dangled a bag of assorted candy while biting off a piece of taffy.

“Hey! Grandpa said that was supposed to be for me!”

“Not anymore.” She chomped the sticky mess in her mouth between words. A few tootsie rolls fell out of the bag as she rummaged for something else.

“Oh, you can have those.” She grimaced. “I don’t like those anyway.”

I picked up the pieces of candy from the floor and put them on the bottom bunk.

“They’re better than nothing,” I thought, as I set Teddy on top of the pillow.

“Why couldn’t you just go with your parents?” Kasey was scowling, still upside down.

“They’re going on a business trip,” I said. “Kids aren’t allowed.”

“Whatever,” Kasey said, disappearing over the edge of the bed. I wondered if Kasey was going to be this way the entirety of my stay. No, she couldn’t be. Not with the grown-ups around. Even when they weren’t she could be alright sometimes. Maggie’s barking from the porch interrupted the thought. From the window next to the bunk bed, I saw Granny’s car pulling up the driveway and into the lean-to carport behind the house. I ran through the kitchen and out the back door to meet her. Kasey shoved me aside as she rushed past me into the carport.

“Granny, Granny! You’ll never guess what I did at school today!”

“I’m sure it was wonderful sweetheart.” Granny fumbled an unlit cigarette to her lips.

“Hi, Granny!”

“Well, hi there, Johnny!” Granny hugged me. “Are you hungry for some cheeseburgers?”

“You make the best cheeseburgers in the world, Granny.” She smiled as I said this and slammed the back door shut behind us. It was an old door, possibly part of the house’s original construction. The latch didn’t work most of the time, and there was about an inch between the bottom of the door and the threshold. I remembered how scared I was last summer when I spent the night. I could see coyotes’ feet under the door as they walked through the carport. Occasionally, one would bump the door and it would open slightly, only to be stopped by the chain holding it shut. It was terrifying to see one of the wild dogs’ muzzles through the small gap as they howled.

“Damn this old door.” Granny slammed it again two more times before kicking a wooden wedge under it to keep it shut. The chain jangled as she fastened it shut. Turning around, I could see her look of exhaustion give way to anger as she looked over the messy kitchen.

“Daniel Lee!” Grandpa hurried to his feet and ambled inside, the screen door slamming behind him.

“Why didn’t you do anything while I was gone today? This place is a wreck!”

“I did plenty while you were gone, woman!”

“Oh, like the dishes?” She gestured to the overflowing sink of dirty cups and plates.

“I had to pace myself, so I took out the trash, emptied the ash-trays, checked the mail, made some coffee…”

“And then sat around listening to music and watching the weather channel.”

“Don’t be mad Granny,” I said. “He has a bad back.”

“I know sweetie.” Granny sighed. “Why don’t you and Kasey go outside and play?”

After dinner, Granny took us to the field with the oak tree. Kasey and I used sticks we found like swords, slashing through the occasional cluster of tall grass. You couldn’t tell from the road, but trash littered the field, smashed beer cans, worn-out clothes, and who knew what else. Kasey and I prodded at a large black bag, ripping at the seams.

“Stay out of that, kids! You don’t know where it came from or what it is,” Granny said as she lit another cigarette.

Kasey and I bolted off ahead, “fighting” other imaginary pirates until we came to the oak tree. We ran around it, played tag under it, and swung from the low-hanging branches. Kasey even helped me reach some stray acorns from a branch I couldn’t reach. I was a bit nervous, climbing. When I broke my arm last summer, Kasey and I were trying to get her kite out of the spruce tree in the front yard. This felt eerily similar, but I got down with no trouble. We divided the acorns between ourselves and pretended they were doubloons. Kasey could be alright, at times like this. Neither of us had siblings and it was fun having someone to play with. I had to admit, even if she was terrible sometimes, Kasey could still be a lot of fun.

“Eww,” Kasey said pointing between a couple of the tree’s exposed roots. “What’s that?”

“What is it Kasey?” Granny looked down from the clouds she was looking at.

“It’s moving,” Kasey said, pointing.

A clump of ladybugs the size of a football crawled around and over top of each other. I couldn’t believe we missed it when we were playing our game of tag. I had no idea why these ladybugs were doing this. I wondered if Mrs. Smith would know. She knew about lots of things.

“They must be huddling together to stay warm,” Granny said. She turned her head upward to the darkening sky as thunder rumbled in the distance.

“Come on, you two. It sounds like rain is on the way.”

“Aww, Granny! Can’t we stay a little longer? We’re still trying to find the X where the treasure is.” Kasey pouted as she said this.

“Kasey,” Granny said with a stern look on her face.

“Come on, Johnny! Let’s race back to the house.”

“O.K.” I ran as fast as I could after her, but it was no use. Kasey was taller than me and a faster runner. I could barely see her magenta jacket between the sporadic growths of grass and the odd bush. Finally, she was out of sight. I gave up and tried to catch my breath. The distant rumble of thunder became louder as I walked the rest of the way back to the house.

Granny made us take baths before we went to the living room to watch TV. I forgot to pack my pajamas, so Granny gave me one of Kasey’s old ones to wear. They were red flannel with a zipper and built-in feet. Ky’s pajamas were almost identical, just bigger. Granny thought us wearing matching outfits would make a great picture. She snapped one of us on the couch with her polaroid. Granny had to get up early, so she couldn’t stay up with us long.

“Don’t stay up too late.” She said, hugging us goodnight. Kasey got up and left the room. I decided to get one of the VHS tapes ready. I checked the cartoon channels, but nothing good seemed to be on. I just started the “Speed Racer” tape when Kasey plopped down on the couch with a bowl of popcorn. I reached for a handful when she jerked the bowl out of my reach.

“Don’t wipe your hands on my pajamas.” She gestured to my borrowed outfit.

“I wasn’t going to.”

“Good. Because they’re mine.” I could already hear my grandparents snoring in the small house. I tried to enjoy the cartoon, despite realizing Kasey now had free reign to torment me as much as she liked. She made fun of how the people’s lips didn’t match what they were saying. She mocked the characters and made me wish I had just gone to bed. Between her comments and the howling wind outside I could barely focus. We only finished one episode when I decided to go to bed. I could always take the tapes home and enjoy them there.

“At least she won’t be able to bother me while I sleep,” I thought.

I was wrong. The overcast, rumbling skies from earlier had given way to a thunderstorm. Lightning flashed against the skeletal tree branches out the window and I held Teddy tight. Kasey’s long black hair hung from her upside-down head as she peered down from the top bunk. Her pale face looked at me in the dark.

“I bet you don’t know about the witch that lives in those woods.” She pointed at the woods behind the house.

“There aren’t any witches around here.”

“Are so! Kathy Connors showed me a book all about them at school.”

“Goosebumps are just made-up stories.”

“It wasn’t a Goosebumps book, stupid. It was about a town nearby with a bunch of witches. They were caught casting spells and making sacrifices in the woods. The townspeople found them after hearing the cries of children they were killing.”

I didn’t say anything. I just shuddered at the thought.

“Then,” Kasey continued, “a bunch of angry villagers chased them through the woods until they caught and executed every witch but one. She escaped and was seen flying on her broomstick in the night sky. She hovered over the gallows and said she would avenge the death of the other witches in her coven.”

“Stop making things up. None of that’s true.” I shuddered.

“It is true. It was in that book. It said bad things happened to the people who tried capturing her. Their crops didn’t grow, their animals died, their children vanished without a trace. They never found her, and she still haunts the woods to this very day.”

I held Teddy tight as thunder clapped and wind raged outside. I couldn’t wait for this visit to my grandparents to end.

Birds scattered from behind a bush as we ran through the empty field. The thunderstorm of the previous evening had given way to a crisp, foggy morning. We found stick swords and decided to pick up our game of pirates from the night before. Once we got through the overgrown fence row, however, our attention was immediately diverted to the oak tree. It had fallen. We looked at each other before throwing down our sticks and running to see what happened. Granny told us the tree was over 200 years old, I couldn’t believe it collapsed. I gasped for air as I tried keeping up with Kasey. Without the tree sticking up in the center of the field, I realized how easily I could get lost. Most of the tufts of grass were taller than I was. Besides a few trees in the fence row, nothing else was visible. Kasey was no help. She ran so far ahead I could barely catch a glimpse of her magenta jacked as I rounded a cluster of grass before she would disappear behind the thick fog and foliage.

My lungs burned and my throat was hoarse from breathing the cold air when we both stopped at the terrible sight. The once-great tree lay on the ground, its massive trunk splintered a couple of feet above the ground. Most of the branches were crushed or broken off as they fell. Kasey and I looked at each other before getting closer. The cluster of ladybugs was nowhere to be found. The limbs I swung from just yesterday lie shattered beneath the weight of the wrecked tree. Worse still, inside the jagged stump, I could see the wood in the center was dead. Frowning, I grabbed a handful of waterlogged, decomposing wood. Only the outer few inches of the tree beneath the bark was actually alive. I realized it was probably on the verge of collapse since I first saw it.

“You see,” Kasey said, as I wiped the rotten wood from my hands. “It’s the witch.”

Kasey jumped up on the collapsed tree trunk and walked its length like a balance beam. “She’s still haunting those woods. All these years later, she’s still making bad things happen.”

I felt a chill, but couldn’t tell if it came from Kasey’s story or the strong breeze which seemed to come from nowhere.

“A witch couldn’t have done this,” I said. “She’d be a hundred years old by now.”

“Doesn’t matter,” Kasey jumped from the trunk. “Witches live hundreds of years on the blood of children just like us.”

I desperately wanted this to be false. I tried to think of a way to prove Kasey was lying.

“The witch couldn’t live all year in the woods. What about winter? She would have frozen to death.”


“That’s why she killed the farmer who used to plant this field. Why don’t you think anyone lives in the house at the crossroads?” Kasey gestured to the derelict house at the opposite end of the field. A window from the house’s turret peeked ominously through empty tree branches and rising fog.

“My dad said nobody lives there because it isn’t safe. He said the roof is caving in.”

“Has he ever been there before?” Kasey wore a terrible smirk on her face.

“I don’t…”

“Of course, he hasn’t! Because he knew the witch was living inside.” The wind was picking up again and I felt cold standing next to the old oak tree.

“I’ll bet none of the grown-ups have gone to that house. They’re probably all scared, just like you.”

“Am not!” I felt my brow furrowing.

“Scaredy cat! Scaredy cat! Scaredy cat!”

“I am not.”

“Then come with me.”

“Where?”

“To the witch’s house stupid.” Before I could say anything, Kasey took off through the fog. Her bright jacket almost completely vanished before I tried catching up with her. I didn’t want to go to the house, but I definitely didn’t want to stay by myself in the fog. At this point, I had no idea where Kasey was. I just knew the direction she went. The occasional crow erupted from a hiding place around the clumps of grass as I struggled to keep up. Their loud caws were the only sound I could hear besides the squishing of wet grass and my strained breathing as I ran. The fog seemed to thicken at the far end of the field. In some places, I couldn’t see more than a few feet ahead of me.

I finally reached the tree line before the house’s yard when I saw Kasey’s magenta jacket. She was moving slowly toward the back porch of the house. I ran the short distance to catch up with her. She must have heard my footsteps because she turned to face me with a finger to her lips. She gestured for me to come closer.

“Somebody is inside,” She whispered.

“Stop telling lies.” I shuddered at the thought. I felt exposed in the relatively empty, albeit overgrown yard.

“I’m telling the truth.” Kasey’s eyes were wide. “I saw a shadow move behind the upstairs window.”

I looked at the dilapidated house and realized it was in even worse shape than I thought. Wooden siding hung loosely from the sides of the house. Several of the windows were shattered. Vines from some wild plant grew through the collapsed portion of the roof. The porch was riddled with termite holes. The door on the back porch stood halfway open, giving us a view of the hallway. Wallpaper hung, peeling from chalky plaster. The wooden floor was covered with moss, scraps of paper, and broken ceiling tiles. The staircase had several broken steps. We stopped in our tracks at bottom of the porch steps.

“Come on aren’t you going to come inside?” Kasey looked much less sure of herself.

“Nobody could live in this place. Not even a witch.”

“So, you say.”

Kasey took the first step onto the porch. I followed close behind, keeping a watchful eye to the trees around the house. I felt like we weren’t alone as we advanced on the back door. I tried thinking of some way to get Kasey to leave this place as the porch creaked under our combined weight. We avoided the broken boards until we were at the threshold of the ruined house. With an uncertain foot, Kasey stepped into the house. Stray pieces of glass crunched underfoot as I followed on the filthy carpet. I looked through a doorframe to my right and could see light streaming in from the holes in the roof. The vines I saw outside disappeared into a large sink filled with decaying leaves and blackened water. Debris under my feet made more noise as I walked into the tiled floor of what I now recognized as a kitchen. The plaster from the walls left coarse white dust over most of the counters and floors. I was about to turn and find Kasey when I stopped in my tracks. There was a muddy footprint on the floor. I looked down at the wet mud around its edges and felt suddenly sick. It was at least twice the size of my own foot. I followed the muddy outlines and realized they went up the stairs.

My eyes followed the stairs up to the landing and fixed themselves on a weathered door on the top step. A door creaking echoed through the house. It came from upstairs. Kasey ran past me in the hallway and out the back door. I heard noises like a cat hissing loudly as I bolted from the kitchen after Kasey. I felt my world spin as I slipped on some of the trash and hit the wooden hallway floor with a loud thump. I gasped and clutched my chest as I felt the wind knocked out of my lungs. Large clumps of plaster ground loudly against the wood and forgotten leaves of paper crumbled as I scrambled out the front door. A door somewhere in the house slammed as I jumped from the porch. Kasey was standing at the fencerow waving for me to run. Her eyes looked back in horror. I turned to see a shadowy figure behind the curtain at the top of the turret move.

We avoided the field the rest of the day. We didn’t even leave the house, we just stayed on the couch and away from the windows until bedtime. That night, Kasey left her blanket hanging over the edge of the top bunk to cover the window looking into our room, and got into the bottom bunk with me.

“I’ll bet the witch saw us,” Kasey said.

“Maybe she didn’t.” I knew how foolhardy the suggestion was before I said it.

“Didn’t you see her moving behind the upstairs curtain? She had to have seen us.”

“Then why didn’t she come after us? Surely she wouldn’t let us get away.”

Kasey thought for a minute. I could hear the flap, slap, flapping of the worn-out screen door in the carport. I reassured myself. I checked the back door before I came to bed. The chain was in place. Nobody could open the door from the outside, not even with a key.

“Maybe the witch only comes out at night. Like a vampire.”

“Maybe.” I lay there holding Teddy tight. That morning I hadn’t believed anything about witches. Now I was having a serious conversation about the possibility one could be just across the barren field next to my grandparents’ house.

“What are we going to do?”

“I don’t know.”

The wind billowed past the window near the bunk bed. I cringed as a low branch scraped against the glass. “I’ll ignore it,” I thought to myself. I wasn’t about to let a little wind bother me, not when I had a real problem.

That’s when I heard the doorknob to the back door rattle. I could hear the loud thumps as something slammed into the back door. We screamed in our beds as the chain rattled with each attempt to shove the door open. Maggie, the black lab barked and started growling at the back door.

“Someone is trying to get in!” Tears ran down Kasey’s face. I could hear the mattress in my grandparents’ room groan as they got out of bed. With speed I wasn’t used to seeing, Grandpa rushed past the open door to the guest room with his shotgun. The glow of the floodlights in the carport shined through the blanket covering our window. Granny ran into our room and tried her best to comfort us.

“Shhhh. It’s alright,” She said, hugging us. “It’s just coyotes.” In all the commotion, the blanket fell from the window. Now the once familiar yard and fence row looked menacing in the blueish light.

“Granny it’s not coyotes. The witch is trying to get in!” Kasey cried again.

“That old wives’ tale? Sweetie, there’s nothing out there but those wild dogs. Grandpa is locking the door, don’t you worry.”

“By lock, she means shoving the wooden wedge under the bottom to keep it closed,” I thought as I looked outside. I stared into the darkened tree line and field beyond. It was impossible to tell if anything was out there, but my eyes kept playing tricks on me. Shoots of grass looked like a crouching witch. Empty tree branches looked like emaciated hands. Every rustling leaf and swaying tree left me more uncertain about whether something lurked just beyond the reach of the floodlights outside.

We gathered enough courage to venture outside the next day. The blue spruce swayed in the breeze. I could still see the yellow splinters where I broke a branch off trying to get my cousin’s kite last summer. I remembered her telling me to go out on the limb alone because it was too small for us both.

“We need to come up with a plan for what to do about the witch,” Kasey said as she climbed on top of the platform of the old well.

“Grandpa said not to play up there! The platform isn’t safe to stand on!”

Kasey grabbed the long pump handle on the well and rocked on the balls of her feet. It creaked as she pumped rusty water from the spout.

“But… Granny said it was just coyotes.”

“She just wanted to keep us from getting scared. Would you want two little kids to know a witch was trying to get into the house?”

I shook my head. “No.”

“Exactly. She probably had no idea how to get rid of a witch in the first place.”

I looked up at Kasey. “Do you?”

“Um,” Kasey looked down as she jumped from the platform. “Salt! That’s it. Witches can’t cross a trail of salt.”

“How do you know that?”

“My cousin Jeremy told me so. He’s the one who let me borrow the book about witches.”

“I thought you said Kathy Co…”

Kasey looked angry. “Shut up. I told you I read it didn’t I?”

“Yes.” I looked down at my feet. “But how are we going to put salt all the way around the house? We’d need a huge bag!”

“Not if we just do the doors and windows. Here’s what we’ll do: We can wait till Grandpa and Granny are asleep. Then, we’ll get into the cupboard and get their can of salt. Then We can spread the salt. It’s that easy!”

“But what if the witch gets us while we’re outside?”

“She won’t get us. Not if we finish before the witching hour.”

“The what?”

“Midnight? That’s when witches come out.”

Suddenly grandpa appeared on the porch. “Kids… Lunch is ready.”

Kasey and I trudged through the yard and back to the house. Climbing the steps to the house, I noticed something odd: the radio was off. Grandpa might have turned down the volume during the day while he watched the weather forecast and local news, but he almost always kept it on till Granny got home. The TV was also off as we walked through the living room. If felt wrong for there not to be some ambient noise in the house. I pulled up a chair at the kitchen table and started crushing crackers into my chicken noodle soup. Grandpa was quiet as he sat down to eat. His usual, laid-back demeanor was replaced with alert eyes and silence. He was wearing the olive drab jacket from his army days and I could see brass and waxed paper cylinders in his pocket. I realized they were shotgun shells. Kasey and I looked at each other as we ate our soup. I wondered if she noticed this when the police scanner screeched to life in the living room. Grandpa got up and turned the volume down after the dispatcher said something about a suspect being “at large”. I wondered what that meant.

“Why aren’t you listening to music grandpa?”

He made a small smile. “I have a bit of a headache. It’ll go away with a little quiet.”

We finished eating and Grandpa asked us to stay inside while he made a phone call. I thought it was unusual for him to take the call outside, but he said we could watch TV while he was talking. He spoke in hushed tones as he paced the porch, occasionally looking over his shoulder. I wondered what had him acting this way as I turned on the TV. Grandpa left it on the news and there was a hand-drawn picture of a man with long, scraggly hair and strange-looking eyes. I didn’t give it much thought before changing to a cartoon channel. Scooby-Doo was on and I always loved watching them solve mysteries. I hoped another episode would be on next because Fred was pulling a mask off a supposed “wolf-man”. It was always just a man in a mask. There were no real monsters, no matter how real they seemed.

Kasey plopped down on the couch. “Just checked. There’s plenty of salt in the cupboard.”

“Why can’t we put the salt out now? In the daytime?”

“Do you remember how mad Granny was when you used all her spices on ‘Experiments’ that one time? Besides, Granny might see the salt and try to clean it up.”
I felt embarrassed thinking back to the time I dumped the whole spice cupboard into a mixing bowl. I thought I was doing a chemistry experiment, but in reality, I was just making a mess of nutmeg, cinnamon, and garlic powder.

“Are you sure it’s safe?”

“Of course. I read that book. I even did a show-and-tell about it.” We were interrupted by the rattling of the screen door.

“Well, Johnny,” Grandpa said. “Your parents are coming back a day early. The retreat ended, so they’ll be here late tonight or early in the morning to pick you up. They’re on the way to the airport right now.” He ruffled my hair as he walked through the living room, lighting another cigarette.

“Your Granny is coming home early from work today too. Maybe we’ll have some more cheeseburgers for supper.”

Grandpa smiled as he said these things, but I could tell something was off. Kasey and I kept watching TV until Granny got home. Even with her back, the house was quiet. She didn’t get onto Grandpa for not doing the dishes or cleaning up around the house. My grandparents stayed barely even spoke, except for a few whispered words. My parents called while I was in the bath to let my grandparents know they were on the way, but it would be a few hours before they showed up.

“We’re going to head to bed,” Granny said as she rubbed her eyes. “Johnny, your parents are going to be here late tonight.” She glanced at the clock. “You and Kasey can watch cartoons until they get here, just promise me you’ll wake me up when they get here. OK?”

“OK, Granny,” I said giving her hugs before Kasey and I settled back onto the couch.

“One more thing,” Granny said from behind her bedroom door. “Keep the doors locked.”

I thought this a weird request, but Ky and I both agreed. Granny went to bed. I looked at the clock near the TV. It was almost 11 o’clock. I wondered if I could get out of Kasey’s crazy idea. It didn’t take long before I could hear my grandparents snoring in their room. I pretended to be interested in the movie on TV. It was a kids’ movie about witches trying to capture a small girl about my age. She had a big brother who was trying to keep her safe. “I wished my cousin was more like him,” I thought as I watched Kasey disappear into the kitchen. I thought she was making popcorn until I hear the faint sound of a chair dragging across the floor to the cupboards. I thought about what she was doing when the movie suddenly had my full attention. One of the kids in this movie shook salt all around her just as the witches were closing in on her. Kasey hadn’t read about salt keeping witches away. She must have watched this movie and assumed I had never seen it. I felt betrayed. The same feeling I had as the branch of the spruce tree cracked under my weight while I tried to get Kasey’s kite. This was just another one of Kasey’s tricks.

She returned to the living room with a can picturing a girl holding an umbrella.

“Here, you take this.” She held out the salt shaker from the table. “Now, it’s simple. We go out the front door I’ll go around the left side, you go around the right side, then…”

“No,” I said. Kasey looked taken aback. I think it was one of the few times I ever confronted her.

“What?”

“I’m not going to that side of the house. It’s closest to the empty field where the witch’s house is.”

“Yes, you will.”

“If you try to make me go to the right side of the house, I’ll wake up Granny and tell her what you’re up to.” Kasey’s lip quivered with frustration.

“F-Fine,” she said. “You take the left side since you’re such a fraidy-cat. You cover the windows on your side of the house, and I’ll cover mine.” She threw the salt shaker at me and waited next to the door. I looked at the clock before I joined her. We still had almost an hour I thought, although I was considerably less confident in this solution. I realized Kasey was just trying to use me again. As I put my sneakers on, I had an idea. Why not simply act like I was putting salt around the windows until she was out of sight, and then sneak back inside. The door to the carport had that large gap under it. I could spread salt under it from inside the house.

The front door of the house opened silently and Kasey gingerly closed the screen door after us. “Meet back here,” she said. I nodded as I climbed down the left side of the porch and salted around the window on the front of the house. The cold night air made my breath fog up as I kept an eye on Kasey. She already finished her window and disappeared around the corner of the house. Once I was sure she wasn’t coming back, I tip-toed up the porch and carefully slipped inside the screen door. I kicked off my shoes and walked to the back door to spread the salt onto the threshold. I felt somewhat proud for standing up to Kasey. I tried to think of another time I had done this but couldn’t.

The shaker was almost empty as I took the top off. I knelt to the ground to pour the last of my salt along the threshold. The white salt shone in the light of the clear night. I admired the job I had done, even if I thought it wasn’t effective, and I knew Granny wouldn’t be happy when she found it in the morning. I was about to stand up when I froze. Beneath the door were two muddy boots. I was so shocked I didn’t say anything until the door creaked open slightly and I saw the sharp blade of a knife hook into the links of the chain holding the door closed. I yelled for my grandpa as I realized what was happening.

I scrambled away from the door and under the kitchen table as I heard grandpa jump out of bed. Through the crack of the door, I could make out vague features of the man outside as he shook the door violently, trying to get in. With the long hair, the thin face, the wild, deranged eyes I realized it was the man on the news station. Grandpa ran into the kitchen with nothing but his boxers and the shotgun.

“Get the hell out!” He pumped the shotgun and the arm with the knife disappeared through the battered door. Grandpa knelt down. “What happened? Are you hurt? Where’s Kasey?”

We heard Kasey’s high-pitched scream. From the kitchen floor, I could see through the window in the guest bedroom. The crazed man had run into Kasey trying to get away and grabbed her. Grandpa ran out the back door with the shotgun after them, but he couldn’t move fast enough, not with his bad back. The last I saw of my cousin was her pale face screaming in horror and outstretched hand reaching for grandpa as she disappeared into the overgrown field of Indiangrass beyond the reach of the floodlights.",1,1739537376.0,CreepsMcPasta,0,1.0,False

Abstract
Assyrians are the oldest civilization of Mesopotamia and have a history of 5500–6000 years. They are known as the first civilization in history, founded in Antakya by Mor Petrus in 37–43 AD and briefly announcing Christianity to the whole Middle East. Today, it is estimated that there are 12 and a half million Assyrians in the world and 45,000 Assyrians in Turkey. Most of them live in different regions of Eastern Anatolia, mostly in Istanbul.

The Ottoman Empire served as home to countless cultures and religions with its 500-year history, and this cultural wealth made a positive impact on the culinary culture, creating a unique kitchen. Various sources argue that the cultures of Assyrians, especially in the regions where Assyrians lived, constituted Assyrian culinary cultures with a dense population.


In this study, the history of the Assyrian, the regions they lived extensively in the world and Turkey, and the beliefs and practices in birth, marriage, death, feast, and holy days have been examined in terms of gastronomic culture

Introduction
Mesopotamia, where history, civilization, religions, and early cultures are formed, has been a cradle of many civilizations. One of the most important elements of these cultures is Assyrians, and Mesopotamia is regarded as their homeland. Turkey’s different provinces in the South-eastern Anatolia region are multicultural places where people from many religions and nations live together in peace.


It is announced that the Assyrian name comes from the Aramaic King “Sürrüs” who founded the city of Antakya in 1400–1500 BC. Patriarchate centers are still located in Damascus, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and India with an estimated population of about 5 million today although they depend on various races [1].


Since the majority of the borders of the Tur Abdin region, which was the first geography of Assyrians, included the province of Mardin, this region has been regarded as one of the cultural riches of Turkey due to Assyrians who have started to define the public name with the influence of the media in recent years. 

Interest in these destinations has also increased due to the importance of cultural and faith tourism which are becoming popular throughout the world.

Culinary culture of a region refers to the unity of the beliefs and practices that develop in this region that makes of its own culture [2]. Traditional Anatolian culinary culture has emerged as a result of hundreds or even thousands of years of efforts. 

This means that the share of many communities coming from different periods and times from the beginning is undeniable. Because the culinary culture of each community coming from different places and from different times played an important role in influencing and diversifying the development of Anatolian culinary culture, Assyrian culinary culture has been formed depending on the geographical and climatic conditions of the South-eastern Anatolia Region and has a structure that contains wheat, meat, and spices. 

The Assyrian cuisine, which is formed in the land that hosts all Mesopotamian civilizations, is a blended form of cultures of different civilizations. The culinary culture of Assyrians who have migrated to many countries of the world and live in small groups has been limited only in the regions where they live collectively, and their awareness of the world has not been achieved. Ensuring the sustainability of a culinary culture that is limited in family meetings and Assyrian churches is very difficult compared to the world’s widely accepted Chinese, Italian, and Indian ethnic cuisines. 


In this study, it is aimed to introduce the ethnic origin of Assyrians, to explain the traditions and some traditional Assyrian dishes that are held on important days and feasts of the Assyrian culture, and to investigate how the cuisine culture of the Assyrian community, which has been living with the Turks for years, is influenced by the Turkish cuisine culture.


Distribution of Assyrians in the world
Assyrians live mostly in Mardin, Sanliurfa, Adiyaman, Gaziantep, Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Sirnak, Malatya, Ankara, İzmir, and İstanbul, and they also have spread out almost everywhere including Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Holland, France, Canada, Spain, Brazil, India, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Austria, Australia, and the USA (Fig. 1) [3]. 


However, demographically, Assyrians have lost blood constantly. The main settlement areas of Mesopotamia, terror in Anatolia and Syria, and lack of security caused Assyrians living in the region to migrate to various cities of Turkey, especially Istanbul. Meanwhile, there have also been immigrants to countries such as the USA, Switzerland, Germany, France, Holland, Brazil, and India [4].
Fig. 1

Assyrian world population. The surveyed region in this study is İstanbul which is located in Turkey’s Marmara region. In terms of population, Assyrians today are around 45,000 in Turkey, with 2500 in the Southeast and 10,000 in Istanbul


Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Turkey, which belong to Mesopotamia Land in general, constitute the areas where Assyrians in the South-eastern Anatolia region intensify. In these regions, the culture of Assyrians is still alive. Today, it is estimated that there are 12.5 million Assyrians in the world and this number includes all the Assyrian groups in the world (Melkit, Keldani, Nasturi, Maronite, Assyrian Orthodox, Assyrian Catholic, and Assyrian Protestant). However, the total number of Assyrian Orthodox groups in the world is 2.5 million [5].

Historically, Assyrians have formed the largest outward migration group in and around Mardin. As of today, around 2500 Assyrians have been living in Mardin and the surrounding area [6]. Sixty thousand in Germany, 12,000 in the Netherlands, and 50,000 Assyrians in Sweden can be seen [7].

The number of Assyrians in İstanbul, which was 8000 in 1993, has increased to 10,000 today with migrations from Mardin and Şırnak provinces. This situation caused the number in the South-eastern Anatolia region to fall to 2000–3000 [8].

Important days and the culinary culture
There are religious influences in the culinary culture which varies across regions. Therefore, special days based on belief have important role on the Assyrian culinary culture. Events such as the birth of Jesus, being crucified, the resurrection, and the ascension have importance in the community life and are regularly celebrated every year. There are also celebrations about Mary and various Christian saints [9].

#Festivals/celebrations
The festivals can be divided into two groups in the Assyrian culture: religious and irreligious festivals.

The events of Jesus the Messiah, especially from the time of his birth to the time of the crucifixion and the ascension, are celebrated as religious festivals. The events about Virgin Mary and the holy spirit are also assessed in this category. Some of these festivals are New Year (1 January), baptism (6 January), the Easter (the resurrection) (April), pentecost (“pentikost”) (the coming of the holy spirit) (23 June), and Christmas (the birth) (25 December) [10]. The Easter festival, Hano Kritho, Suboro, and fast days can be related to the Assyrian culinary culture.

#Easter festival: The Easter is the most important and longstanding festival for Assyrians. After 50-day fasting, the Easter is celebrated. During these 50 days, food of animal origin such as meat, milk, and egg is forbidden to eat [11]. One of the characteristic features of the Easter festival is that Assyrians give eggs to each other as gifts. It is a traditional occasion to give red eggs to guests. To prepare red eggs, first, one layer of onion skin is placed in the pan and one layer of egg is placed on this and the same process is repeated until the pan is full. Salt and vinegar are added to the eggs to avoid cracking, and eggs are boiled in water with onion skins. 

When the color of the onion skin is transferred to the egg, the color of the egg becomes red. In general, red eggs are prepared 1 day before the festival. This tradition, which still maintains its validity today, is colored with chemical dyes on the outer surface of the egg in big cities. The egg yolk represents reproductivity, light, and sun; egg white represents peace, naturality, and purity; the red color represents blood that Jesus raised for the redemption of people when he was crucified [12]. In the festival, red pitta, lebeniye, and rice pudding are served besides the egg.


Hano Kritho: As a traditional feast of Assyrians who lived in Mesopotamia for thousands of years, this tradition is applied on the last Sunday before the beginning of the 50-day Grand Fast (usually the middle of March) every year. Hano Kritho is a female figurine representing fertility and starts with collecting bulgur, “kavurma,” and eggs from the dwellings. The gathered food is brought together in the church of the village and ends with the preparation of traditional foods like “kavurmalı bulgur,” egged bulgur [13].


Suboro/Siboro (Virgin Mary Gospel Festival): This festival is celebrated in memory of Gabriel’s gospel to Mary that she was pregnant and has to give her son the name “Jesus.” On the night of this festival, the daughter of the family kneads unleavened dough and sprinkles grains on the dough. One white and one red yarn put on the dough, and the girl then walks around the neighborhood with the dough. 

After this ceremony, old yeast changes with the new one.

Fast days: Legend and beliefs are important influences in the formation of cuisines. Fasting and abstinence meals in the Assyrian cuisine are made with olive oil because of the religious belief that animal foods are not consumed [14]. In the Assyrian reverence, there are many abundant and long periods of fasting and abstinence that are not seen in any other society.

In the fast days, Assyrians eat kenger and ışgın, helhel, daşışto dugarso, davke hamiğe, and derman. Kitel raha is the first meal that Assyrian priests eat after the fast day. Derman was not actually considered a meal, but it was named as a meal because it was eaten during Grand Fast. Equal amounts of chickpea, corn, and wheat that are separately roasted previously are mixed and roasted with thyme, sesame, salt, and pepper. Then, the blend which is grinded with a hand mill and kept in sacks is eaten mixed with hot water and accompanied by hot bread in fast foods.

Irreligious festivals are commemorating ceremonies for historical people and events which are effective on the presence and protection of religion and church. They are also known as the memorial day of saints. There is no culinary culture about irreligious festivals.

#Yamino ceremony
The name is given to the #engagement ceremony of Assyrians in Mardin. After the engagement, a special donut (yamino bun) made by the bride’s family is given to the guests from the “yamino cottage.”

During the wedding meal, arriving guests are offered “Merge/Marga,” a traditional wedding meal of Assyrians. It is a meal which is eaten with lavas bread and meat pieces cooked in broth. At the same time, this meal is made especially during the feast days of Christmas (Noel-Yaldo). Wedding meals differ in accordance with the economic situation in urban and rural areas. Dobo, maldum, and kavurma assume an important place in family visits made after the wedding. Dobo is known as the king’s food and is one of the most important local meat dishes for the most valued guests. This dish is integrated with bulgur pilaf. Assyrians are called the next day of the wedding as “sabahiye.” On the breakfast table arranged for the sabahiye are kaburga dolması (stuffed ribs), kuzu dolması (stuffed lamb), and stuff like şembörek (semburek, sembüsek) [15].

#Funeral ceremony
Tea and mırra (a type of coffee) are served to guests who come to the condolence. It is a religious obligation to serve food during the 3rd, 9th, and 40th days and anniversaries after death in Assyrian traditions. Donuts are distributed on the 15th day of the mourning period [11], and the food is distributed to all neighbors in memory of the deceased person, and this food generally consists of rice or bulgur pilaf.

In the Assyrian tradition, bitter coffee is served in the first hours because it symbolizes sorrow. After the pray, meal and donut are distributed in memory of the person in the name of mercy. It is also a tradition to serve bitter coffee in the first year of death.


Special traditional dishes
Recipes and preparations of some special traditional dishes, belonging to the Assyrian culinary culture, had been obtained by using questionnaire form and face-to-face interview technique held on 30 people from the Istanbul Assyrian Orthodox Church in Istanbul. All dishes were prepared in the practice kitchen of Istinye University, Gastronomy and Culinary Arts Department, with the help of voluntary Assyrian women. The photographs of prepared dishes are given in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.

Results and discussions
Assyrian, Kurdish, Yezidi, and Armenian people in Mardin, which has hosted countless cultures and religions throughout thousands of years of history, are the main building blocks of the region’s culture. Even though they have different beliefs after this interaction, this cultural wealth created a unique cuisine by positively affecting the food cultures. Various sources suggest that the basis of regional food culture is the Assyrian culture, which has a dense population in Mardin. 

Despite the variety of soil characteristics and plant and animal existence of the region, the main food components are shaped in the frame of meat and bulgur. Especially in terms of edible plant variety, mahlep, ıkşut, ıbzor-fennel, ogulotu, gabbeze-mausoleum, şeh fit il acuze, and gıbzara are used in many foods.


Another crucial example for the continuity of intergenerational food culture is the preparation of traditional winter food (kavurma, puff pastry, molasses, tomato paste, peksimet) by family members, relatives, and neighbors all together.
It is a tradition to serve bun to Assyrians during the Easter festivals. 

This is a longstanding traditional food that Assyrians could not give up and called “festival cakes” when they cooked it during the festivals. Similarly, Muslims living in the same region cooked bagels which are called “Mevlid bagel” in Mevlids. It has been determined that both Muslim and non-Muslim communities practice similar eating habits at funerals and on certain days after death. 

Especially in the Eastern Anatolian region (Mardin, Adiyaman) where Assyrians live intensively, it is seen that many dishes are consumed by the local people without distinction of beliefs and ethnic groups.


As a result, tolerance and loyalty caused by the existence of many different cultures, religious days, rituals, and traditions of different religions have led to the enrichment of diverse cultures. Assyrian cuisine recognition and promotion activities should be organized with various events. 

The necessary facilities should be provided to every person and institution that researches, writes, and wants to learn. The venues that will revitalize the local Assyrian cuisine should be opened, food competitions and festivals should be made available, and different cultures should be recognized. Assyrians must be pioneers in such organizations and should not spare their spiritual help. The culinary culture that constitutes an important part of the cultivated, cultured, and preserved richness in the soil where the Assyrian cuisine was born should not disappear.

I hate looking at myself in the mirror and feel so unattractive and wonder if anyone would even want to have sex with me or date me. I think if a guy saw my body, he would probably throw up
  
My breasts are EXTREMELY saggy, to the point where they hang right around my waist and the nipples point straight downward. Even in that ""realistic boob gallery"" I haven't seen a pair of breasts that look as repulsive and as low hanging.
 My own grandfather said I have grandma boobs when I decided to go braless in a hoodie, and said to put on a bra in the house because my breasts are extremely disgusting to him. This made me cry, as I was tired of wearing a bra 24/7, even in my sleep, and it was causing me extreme shoulder and back pain along with permanent shoulder indentations, and I couldn't take it anymore, and decided to put my insecurities aside to get some relief.
  
I could tell whenever I hung out with friends that they were genuinely disgusted by my chest whenever everyone was changing clothes, and my one ex-friend even asked if my bra genuinely hangs that low, while trying to look at my boobs over my shoulder while I was hiding them in shame. I have never said anything negative about her appearance once, so this really hurt me. I used to feel so jealous whenever they changed, knowing that my body would never look normal as theirs, or even remotely resemble a human body.

 I also have an extremely flat ass and extremely severe hip dips that make me look like a ogre. My perpetually bloated stomach doesn't help with that either. I have NEVER seen hip dips as severe as mine. (It doesn't help that I'm black, so *EVERYONE* automatically expects you to be born with full hips, and big butt. Whenever I see black girl appreciation posts talking about BW's bodies, I can't relate and it makes me wanna kill myself) When I was a young girl, my mom used to make fun of my naked body while I was changing and asked me why my body looked the way it did, particularly my hip dips and love handles. She would grab at the fat on my nude body and hip dips. This caused me to feel extremely disgusted by this aspect of myself and wonder if my body was just uniquely undesirable. While I was walking out of a coffee shop, a group of boys said my ass was ""flat as hell, but I had giant boobs"" I immediately felt ashamed and disgusted with myself and cried in the skatepark. 

  I feel an extremely homicidal rage in my chest, and I don't know why, but the idea of working out in the gym and growing a bigger butt makes me so angry and resentful, that it makes me want to stab someone to death. The idea of getting a breast lift fills me with the same type of rage. I don't even think I can workout without feeling extreme resentment, a stabbing feeling in my heart, and anger so hot it feels like it's burning inside and wants to destroy everyone and everything around me without a care in the world. It's gotten to the point where the burning rage I feel makes me feel like I can't breathe, I feel physically ill, and I get headaches and squeezing chest pain.

I hate myself so much, but changing would make me hate myself more, and it feels me with extreme bitterness. The idea of a relationship genuinely makes me enraged and disgusted, because I know absolutely no man would even want to look at my naked body with the lights on. I think I just wish I was born with a good body naturally, so I could be okay with someone loving me for how I was born. ",3,1739537111.0,BodyDysmorphia,1,0.81,False
1ip9q5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1ip9q5v/does_akka_superbiotics_actually_work_my/,Does Akka Superbiotics Actually Work? My Experience After One Month,"I’ve seen a lot of discussions about **Akka Superbiotics** and whether it’s worth trying. Like many people, I’ve dealt with bloating, sluggish digestion, and low energy, so I decided to give it a shot for a month. If you’re considering it but aren’t sure if it’s just another overhyped supplement, here’s my experience—the good, the bad, and whether I think it’s worth it.

# What is Akka Superbiotics?

Akka Superbiotics is a gut health and liver support supplement that includes **Akkermansia**, a probiotic that has gained attention for its potential role in metabolism and digestion. Unlike regular probiotics that focus on increasing bacteria count, Akkermansia is said to help **strengthen the gut lining and support liver function**.

It also includes **Quercetin, Resveratrol, and Silymarin**, which are known for reducing inflammation and supporting detoxification. Since the liver plays a major role in digestion and metabolism, the idea is that improving liver function can help with bloating, digestion, and energy levels.

# Why I Tried It

For a while, I’ve had issues with bloating after meals, inconsistent digestion, and energy crashes in the afternoon. I’ve tried probiotics in the past, but they either didn’t work or made my symptoms worse.

After doing some research, I came across Akkermansia and its potential benefits for gut and liver health. Akka Superbiotics seemed to be one of the few supplements that focused on this, so I figured it was worth trying for a month to see if it made a difference.

# What Happened When I Took Akka Superbiotics for a Month

# Week 1: No Major Changes

The first week was pretty uneventful. I didn’t feel much of a difference—no immediate relief, but also no side effects. My digestion felt about the same, and my energy levels hadn’t changed.

# Weeks 2-3: Some Noticeable Improvements

Around the second week, I started noticing that my bloating was happening less often. I wasn’t feeling as heavy after meals, and my digestion felt a little more regular. My energy levels also seemed to stabilize—I wasn’t experiencing the mid-afternoon crashes I usually did.

I also realized that my sugar cravings had decreased. I wasn’t reaching for snacks as often, and when I did, I didn’t feel the urge to overeat. This was a surprising but welcome benefit.

# Week 4: Clearer Benefits

By the end of the fourth week, I could tell that my digestion was better than before I started. My bloating was minimal, and I felt lighter after meals. My energy stayed steady throughout the day, and I wasn’t relying on coffee to get through the afternoon.

# Pros and Cons of Akka Superbiotics

# What I Liked:

✔ Supports digestion and reduces bloating  
✔ Helps with energy levels throughout the day  
✔ No side effects or gut discomfort  
✔ Seemed to curb sugar cravings

# What Could Be Better:

❌ Expensive, especially for long-term use  
❌ Results take time—no immediate impact in the first few days  
❌ Works best with a healthy diet and lifestyle rather than as a quick fix

# Is Akka Superbiotics Worth It?

For me, the results were positive but not instant. If you’re expecting a quick-fix weight loss pill, this isn’t it. But if you’re dealing with digestion issues, bloating, or low energy, **it might be worth trying**. It takes a couple of weeks to start working, but once it did, I noticed a real difference in how I felt.

I plan to continue taking it for another month to see if the benefits continue. If you’re curious, you can find more details [**here**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-akk-tsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=22&uid=33&oid=22&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1041&uid=2376&guoid=1041&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural).

# Final Thoughts

Would I recommend Akka Superbiotics? If you struggle with bloating and digestion, it’s worth considering. It’s not a magic pill, but it does seem to help balance gut and liver health over time.

For example, imagine doing a cheating roleplay with characters from Khabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. The slutty Pooh (Kareena Kapoor) constantly pushing her limits, always small satin robes or sheer robes and nothing else, the ends of the robe stopping at her mid-thigh, the loosely tied belt the only thing protecting her from flashing. Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

or how about a in-universe sequel to Humraaz?

Following the steps of other successful choreographers before him (Farah Khan, Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Acharya, etc) - now Omi has plans to turn into a director and take the responsibility for an entire film.

Raj Singhania (41) has occasionally financed a few films done by his friends. So he is known in the producers-directors circle. One of Omi’s acquaintances helps in setting up a meeting between Omi and Raj. The men meet.

Omi tells Raj, that he wants to make a movie about a married woman, without her knowledge. The woman will be someone who has a dancing background, but has been away from the dancing world for years. Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It’s shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj’s wife. It’s a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya’s girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother’s old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film…

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years. He saw how Omi’s hands had brushed against the naked skin of Priya’s back and waist. How her giant melons had crushed on Omi’s chest a couple of times. He wanted more…

We all have a responsibility to future generations to ensure that our planet remains healthy and habitable. Luckily, there are many simple ways to live more sustainably and reduce your environmental impact. Here are some practical tips to help you adopt an eco-friendly lifestyle:

1. **Reduce Your Waste**: Aim to reduce the amount of waste you produce by being mindful of your consumption habits. Say no to single-use plastics and opt for reusable alternatives instead. Carry a water bottle, coffee mug, and shopping bags with you, and refuse plastic bags when doing groceries. Start composting if you can, or lobby for your community to implement a composting program.

2. **Energy Saving**: Cut down on your energy consumption by making some simple changes around the house. Use energy-efficient light bulbs, turn off lights and appliances when not in use, and consider investing in smart power strips to automatically shut off power to electronics when they're not in use. Insulate your home to improve energy efficiency, and if possible, install solar panels to reduce your reliance on fossil fuels.

3. **Sustainable Shopping**: Make an effort to buy fewer new items, and instead shop secondhand. Thrifting and shopping at consignment stores can be a great way to find unique clothing and reduce the demand for new manufacturing. For essential items, look for sustainable and ethically sourced options. Choose natural, organic, and locally produced foods, and avoid excessive packaging.

4. **Green Cleaning**: Traditional cleaning products often contain harsh chemicals that can harm both your health and the environment. Opt for natural, non-toxic cleaning alternatives instead. You can make your own cleaning solutions using ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils, or look for ready-made eco-friendly options at your local store.

5. **Water Conservation**: Water is a precious resource, and conserving it is an important aspect of sustainable living. Install low-flow showerheads and faucets in your home, and try to take shorter showers. Only run the dishwasher and washing machine when they are fully loaded. If you have a garden, use water-efficient irrigation systems or better yet, grow native plants that require less watering.

6. **Sustainable Transportation**: Consider swapping your car for a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation. Try walking, biking, or taking public transit whenever possible. Carpooling is also a great option, and if you must drive alone, look into hybrid or electric vehicles. Plan your errands efficiently to minimize unnecessary trips.

7. **Conscious Consumption**: Evaluate your purchasing decisions and practice mindful consumption. Ask yourself if you truly need an item before buying it, and consider renting, borrowing, or acquiring secondhand versions of items you don't use often. Unplug from materialistic beliefs and seek out experiences and memories that don't come with a hefty environmental cost.

8. **Support Environmental Initiatives**: Vote with your dollars by supporting businesses and organizations that prioritize sustainability and environmental responsibility. Purchase products with minimal packaging, choose sustainable seafood, and support local farmers by shopping at farmers' markets. You can also join environmental groups or volunteer for local initiatives aimed at cleaning up and protecting the environment.

9. **Educate and Advocate**: Stay informed about environmental issues and share your knowledge with others. Discuss the importance of sustainability with friends and family, and advocate for green initiatives in your community. Use your voice to support politicians and policies that prioritize eco-friendly practices.

Remember, every small action counts when it comes to sustainable living. You don't have to implement all of these changes at once – start with a few that resonate with you and build from there. As you incorporate these practices into your daily life, you'll contribute to a healthier planet for future generations to enjoy.

Together, let's make sustainable living a way of life!

“New Wellington?” Eastern said, “I don’t know that place.”



“You don’t know New Wellington?” Tink said, exasperated. “One of the original colonies?”



“Wait, I think I recall something about them,” Nick said. “We learned about them in school; they got into a war with Parvati, and we kicked them back to Earth.”



“Oh Nick.” Tink said. “I’ll let that pass because you’re a native of Parvati, but it was so much more than that. Also, you cheated. You sent relativistic impactors to the colony and obliterated it.”



“Is it really cheating, if you’re at war?” Nick said



“*Nick*” Selkirk warned. “Tink is our *friend* and was from New Wellington. Let it go. That war sounds like it was a long time ago.”



“A thousand years give or take” Tink agreed, and laughed. “It’s fine really, Selkirk. I’ve had a millennium to get over losing.”



“What actually happened?” Eastern asked.



“When we’re not avoiding destruction from *Kindness*, I’ll tell you about it.” Tink said. As if to punctuate the point, they heard the crash of more laser strikes against Tink’s hull, followed by a metallic zapping noise of Tink returning fire. 



Nick connected back up to Tink’s network and took up position at the sensor suite again, watching Kindness. They had started thrusting up towards Tink, and then in a blinding flash of white, had disappeared. <Tink! They linked away!>



<No, we’re not that lucky.> Tink replied, and Nick increased the scanning resolution. There was another flash and the ship linked in dangerously close to Tink and unleashed their slug throwers. A noise like hail on a metal roof reverberated through the ship, which almost - but not quite - drowned out the noise of the alarms.



Eastern looked down at her console from inside the acceleration couch, and found that Tink’s hull was ablating quickly, and couldn’t take many more hits like that. “Tink, we’re getting pounded. You need to dodge.”



“Starjumper battles don’t usually go that way,” Tink said. “It’s more that we line up and broadside each other until one runs away or is destroyed, instead of a more maneuverable dogfight. We just can’t move that quickly. Kindness is using their wormhole generator to link around and make it tougher for us to return fire, but they shouldn’t be able to do that much more than three or four more times without having to stop and charge their capacitors.”



As if to punctuate Tink’s explanation, *Kindness* disappeared from Nick’s view and reappeared underneath and unleashed a volley of missiles. Tink used his juke charges to dodge, and space lit up with thousands of new points of light as his slug throwers opened up to destroy the missiles.



<Tink, we can’t seem to get a hit on them; *Kindness* is wearing us down.> Nick said.



<I know Nick, but until we get my wormhole generator fixed we’re stuck. Wait, that’s it!> Tink said <Nick, you drive my support frames and repair the generator; I’ll tell you what to do.>



<Do what?> Nick said, and Felt Tink move some things around in the system, and suddenly, it was like a door appeared next to him. Nick reached for the door and as he touched it-



He was standing in a hall, the noise of the alarms odd, distant. Nick looked down at his hands, and as he flexed them, he heard the servos whine. <This is wild, Tink. I’m one of your support frames?>



<Yes, this is how I’m able to run all the BI systems when I don’t have a crew. Get down to engineering and I’ll walk you through what to do.>



As he said it, an overlay appeared in Nick’s vision showing him where to go, and he began to run down the hall.



“Nick! What are you doing?” Selkirk yelled, her voice still muffled by the acceleration couch.



“Tink gave me access to his support frames,” Nick said over the PA. “I’m going to try and repair the wormhole generator.”



“You can’t even set up your metropass emulator without help,” she said. “How are you going to repair a wormhole generator?”



“Tink said he’d show me what to do. I think he thinks it’s an easy fix.”



“It had better be,” Eastern said. “I still remember what you did to my coffee maker.”



<Coffee maker?> Tink asked.



<Look, I didn’t know that an espresso machine worked under pressure!> Nick said. <Anyway, I repaired the wall, and paid to fix her machine, I don’t know why she’s still upset over it.>



As Nick ran through the hall, he was grateful that he was piloting Tink’s support frame. Tink was dodging and weaving and thrusting and flipping as he dodged Kindness’ attacks, and even with the gravity generators and inertial compensation, Nick wasn’t sure he would have been able to stay upright. The closer he got to engineering, the thicker the smoke got and he was thankful that Tink’s support frames didn’t have olfactory sensors. It had turned out that Engineering was the wormhole generator, his reactors and a station for each. The room was cramped. 



 As he stepped towards the massive generator, another overlay appeared in his vision, outlining  parts and wiring and started talking to him, telling him how to begin. “You have a whole application on how to repair your generator, Tink? Why?”



“Remember Nick, I was built to be crewed. It was understood that in an emergency untrained people might have to help repair me, so I have vision overlays and automatic troubleshooting instructions for nearly all my systems. Just follow the prompts.”



As the voice told him what to do, Nick opened panels and started checking readouts. It appeared that Tink was right - it wasn’t that serious of a break. In fact, it might just be the main circuit that had disconnected. <Tink, it looks like the main circuit breaker is open. Is it okay to just try and close it?>



<That’s the other reason I had you drive the support frame. I’m not going to take the reactors off WEP or even power them down. You’re going to have to close the breaker live. It’ll be… sporty.>



Wondering what Tink meant by sporty, Nick’s frame grabbed the massive switch and flipped it. 



Immediately, a lot of things happened all at once, and it was only in hindsight that Nick was able to put together what happened. 



When he flipped the breaker, there wasn’t even time for sparks. Later, Nick was able to review the support frame’s cameras and all they saw was a blinding white flash, and the beginning of a sound. After that, the optical and audio sensors were overloaded, and Nick had to watch the rest from Tink’s room cameras. The arc flash had tossed the support frame across the room, crashing into the reactor and then it fell to the ground, limp. Severely damaged - but not yet destroyed - Nick could feel the vibrations of the wormhole generator through it. With the power restored, the reactors next to him had received a huge load request all at once; under WEP there were no circuit breakers, so the reactors started to blur next to him. There was a feeling that Nick could only describe as being turned inside out and back again, and he was dumped out of the support frame and opened his eyes in the acceleration couch. “Tink! I was disconnected, did it work?”



“It did.” Selkirk said, her voice quiet.



“Oh no, Sel, what did you see this time?” Eastern said, sitting up.



“I saw…” Selkirk took a shuddering breath and tried again “I saw family that I should not have been able to see. Last I knew, they were still alive.”



“Oh, Sel.” Eastern said, and ran over to her. The couch unfolded as Eastern embraced Selkirk while she sobbed.



“Tink, are we safe?” Nick asked, sitting up. The forceful disconnect from the support frame left an odd impression. Nick could see an afterimage of the repair overlay, and his mouth tasted… blue.



“We linked away.” Tink said, carefully. “We are no longer under attack by Kindness.”



“That… doesn’t answer my question Tink.” Nick said as he went over to one of the stations. He didn’t feel like connecting to Tink’s network, so he was checking the sensor suite manually. When the results of his scan were displayed, Nick gasped.



“No Nick,” Tink said, “It doesn’t.”



Suddenly the radio crackled to life. “Unidentified gunship, you have entered K’laxi sovereign space! You will power down your weapons and submit to boarding and inspection. Failure to comply will result in your destruction.”



Wordlessly, Tink sent an image from outside to everyone’s screen. There were at least five K’laxi dreadnoughts within weapons range of Tinker Toy, with two of them actively scanning them.



“Tink…” Selkirk said, her ears flat and her tail limp. Nick noticed that she was working very hard to control her tone. She was upset about what she saw and now... “Where did you link us?”



“I… had a location bookmarked. I received it in trade for some… goods a couple of years ago. I had no idea where it was, but the person selling it to me said that it led ‘somewhere useful’. They had already paid cash, and they offered me the coordinates as a bonus. While Kindness was attacking, I didn’t have time to really pick and choose a location, I just needed to get away. So, I went to the first place in my bookmarks.”



<“Ancestors who wait for my arrival with open arms.”> Sel swore. Eastern looked up sharply; she understood what Sel said. “Open the channel please, Tink.”



“Mic is hot, Sel.” Tink said.



Selkirk started speaking in her native language. Nick didn’t really know a lot of K’laxi languages. He knew that they had hundreds of them, just like humans, and that there were a couple that were mostly spoken out in space - also like humans. Nick had heard that there was even a K’laxi/Human patois that was developing organically on some of the more isolated space stations with a highly diverse crew. He did catch her say Mel’itim, so she must be throwing her weight around as a Major in the secret police.



Meanwhile Eastern heard it. 



<“K’laxi military cruiser. This is Major Selkirk Nemari, Mel’itim. I have requisitioned this vehicle for a class Q mission, and am operating under a letter of marque personally signed by Administrator Ta’reni.”>



There was a pause, and then, <“Major Nemari, our apologies. We did not mean to threaten you or your mission, but you did link into a Class Y staging area. How did you acquire these coordinates?”>



*<How can I understand them?>* Eastern asked the Nanites.



*<Language is no barrier for an Empress. She must be able to understand and be understood across her galaxy, so that she can effectively rule.>*



*<I can understand languages? How many?>*



*<all of them.>*



*<That’s impossible.>* Eastern thought, and then her attention brought her back up. Sel was at the same time mollifying and threatening the commanders.



<“Yes, Major.”> They said, finally. <“Once again, we apologize for making assumptions about your ship, and you are of course welcome to stay in system as long as you need. Will you be…>



<“Yes of couse.”> Sel said, and Eastern saw the muscles around her jaw tighten, and she squeezed her eyes shut. <“Please accept my invitation to dine aboard my ship. The hour is late by our ship's time. We will call for you in six hours.”>



*<Hah. She has already cowed them, and they are offering fealty. She is a valuable asset.>*



*<Sel is more than an* ***asset****>* Eastern thought, angrily.



*<Asset, lover, partner, in the end, so long as they serve you, it does not matter.>* They said, breezily.



Nick, unaware of this could still tell that Selkirk’s presence was able to cool things down. Even without knowing what she said, the K’laxi on the other end started sounding much less… shouty and even had started to speak in more relaxed tones. He wondered if she was threatening them or something. After a few moments the back and forth of the conversation ceased. “Okay Tink, you’re clear to be here now. You’re all, er, under my command right now.”



“Your command, Sel?” Tink asked.



“Yeah, she’s a Major with the Mel’itim,” Eastern said, and caught Selkirk’s eye. Sel flicked an ear, questioning, but Eastern very slightly shook her head no, once.



“The K’laxi secret police? Holy shit Selkirk.”



“Yeah, yeah.” Sel’s ears flattened. “Don’t make a big deal of it, okay? It’s just a job.”



“First someone with the same Nanites as Empress Melody, and now a member of the Mel’itim? What the hell do you two see in Nick?” Tink said, laughing.



“He’s cuddly.” Selkirk said and crossed her arms, but her tail flicked playfully.



“He knows how to take care of a person.” Eastern added.



Nick could only sit in his chair, blushing slightly. “So, Sel, where are we? Between the surprise of fixing the wormhole generator and then you talking us out of trouble, I wasn’t able to figure out where we went.”



“We linked into the middle of a K’laxi staging area. Literally one of the most secure places we have. There are very few non military personnel who know these coordinates.” Sel looked up at Tink’s cameras. “I don’t suppose you’d tell me who paid you with these coordinates? Light smuggling and weapons dealing is one thing, but selling K’laxi secrets? *Someone* might have to pay them a visit.” 



“…They were K’laxi.” Tink said after a moment. “I don’t know much else about them. I have some video feed from the deal, but they stayed in suits and didn’t come aboard. We connected via umbilical, and my frames transferred the crates. They bought mostly small arms, rifles, pistols, things like that, all modded for K’laxi use. By someone else.” Tink added quickly.



“Now that’s... *interesting*.” Selkirk said, and looked down at her pad, but didn’t say anything further. 



“So uh,” Nick said, looking around. “Do we just leave?”



“No, we’re going to have to-” Selkirk sighed. “-host a dinner. I told them it's our rest period though, we have 6 K'laxi - 10 human - hours.”



“Why?” Eastern said, and she got up from her chair and sat next to Selkirk, who leaned against her.



“Protocol. Technically I outrank most of the captains out here doing maneuvers, so I have to host them. It’s nothing too big, just a dinner for us and about 10 K’laxi.”



“What was that face for?” Sel said *sotto voce* as she leaned against Eastern.



“I uh, understood your conversation.” She admitted.



Selkirk’s position didn’t change, but Eastern felt her stiffen. “The Nanites.”



“Yeah. They said that an Empress needs to understand and be understood by her whole galaxy. They say I can understand and be understood in every language.”



“Melody said something similar.” Sel said. “I thought you said you *weren’t* going to be Empress.”



“I… don’t know.” Eastern finally admitted. “These things, these powers that the Nanites give me, they just… happen. I don’t have control over them!”



*<You do have control over them.>* They countered, *<You merely have to accept who you are. You are unstoppable. The K’laxi know this already. To them, you are the* ***undeniable****. Take part in Selkirk’s dinner. You will see. These K’laxi will serve you.>*



“A dinner?” Tink said, suddenly much more cheery. “I’ll do the cooking, I have a bunch of K’laxi dishes I wanted to try out!”

My eyes drift to my phone, seeking the time.



A soft whisper of the call to prayer drifts from a distant mosque. 



Life is at peace, in the early hours of the morning. 



No music, no shouting, only dead silence, and the whoosh of my ceiling fan. 



A bird perches on my windows edge, singing away as the morning sun paints the skies in orange hues. 



I savor the peace, with a cup of coffee, 

Its arabica aroma seeps through my nostrils, 

refreshing my mind, charging my body. 



I’m ready to conquer the world, as I prepare for the rat race in the corporate world of 9-5.



As bleak as it seems, I must endure—

1ip9c98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ip9c98/should_i_ask_my_crush_out/,Should I ask my crush out ?,"I (17f) have my first crush and its destroying my life. When hes around I act like hes watching me even if he isnt. I constantly feel his eyes on me even when they arent, I also asked my friends if they noticed him looking and they said no.

There are a few indications that he might like me back though...

like a few days ago we were on a school trip and we had a few moments..

Like ok, on the first part of the trip everyone shared umbrellas and I was alone with mine, and I saw him standing without one, and Im not sure if anyone else offered him before, but he said yes to me and we shared the umbrella that whole time. And we were eating at this coffee shop and the barista accidentally made me a small so he gave me another big one for free, so I told my crush as a joke ""good looks can get you far.."", and then later he repeated the joke back to me about himself and I was feeling bold so I said ""yes of course"".

There was also this other moment, that I think I maybe f-ed up, where.. ok for context his friend group is mostly girls, and this is about to be hypocritical because my friend group is mostly guys, but he was kind of snuggling with one of his (girl) friends at the campfire. It didnt feel romantic, but theres also this other friend of his who has made her attraction to him very clear, and he was high-fiving her, there also this thing where hes sitting and he has 4 girls sitting with him, one is his cousin but still...

But anyway we were doing a particularly hard part of the trail and he offered me his hand 3 times... and I didnt take it !!!

I know okay. I thought I was indicatng that im not as easy as the other girls.

But then later I had like a mini fight with one of his friends, she made a mean comment and then had no one to sit next to her on the bus and I told her she couldnt sit with me despite that I was sitting alone. Im afraid that my crush saw this and now thinks im a terrible person ???

Any tips ??",1,1739535553.0,Crushes,2,1.0,False

Sunlight streamed through the large bay windows, casting golden patterns across the wooden floors of the charming café. The air was filled with the fresh scent of coffee mingling with the vibrant greenery of potted plants that adorned every corner. Wooden tables gleamed warmly, their surfaces reflecting the day's bright promise. As the door swung open, a gentle breeze carried in the sound of rustling leaves, mingling with the soft hum of conversation. 

“A perfect day for a holiday, right?” Aria looked around, smiling and nodding to her golden helpers, who decided to keep her company at the café.

“I’m so happy to finally have a nice friendly date with all of you, my Winds and Stars \~ C’mon, choose anything you like, my treat!”

Amidst a flurry of chatter and laughter, Winds and Stars debated over the dessert menu, each passionately championing a different choice while unintentionally interrupting one another. Eventually, through giggles and playful jabs, they unanimously settled on a selection of everything to share, satisfied with their collective indecision. “Well, ready to make an order? Alright, then make sure you’ll be able to eat everything, hehe \~” 

A friendly banter erupted around the table as several Winds and Stars playfully teased each other about their tastes in gaming, each trying to defend their favorites with exaggerated enthusiasm. Aria laughed and gently patted their heads. “Ah! You there, guys! Behave \~” The golden helpers swirled around, jumping and giggling.

…as the afternoon unfolded, the café gradually emptied, leaving a serene calm in its wake. Aria settled back in her chair, watching the play of light and shadows dance across the walls. Her mind wandered over recent adventures and the warmth of newfound friendships. A sense of fulfillment accompanied the clinking of cutlery and the soft murmur of distant chatter. A soft touch on Aria’s shoulder brought the girl out of her thoughts, and she gratefully nodded to the waitress that had already placed all the plates and shining cutlery on the table. The golden helpers were dancing and curiously gazing at each other’s meals, trying to decide which ones looked the best.

The wind maiden made a happy little sound, stretching, and picked up a spoon. “Hmm? Yeah, I’ve chosen this chocolate dessert. Look at these delicious caramelized strawberries! Well, shall we start eating?” The golden helpers were floating around in anticipation, humming joyfully. “Hehe, bon appétit then \~” 

With a contented sigh, Aria indulged in the dessert before her, savoring every bite and the tranquility of the moment.",2,1739535545.0,VirtualYoutubers,1,1.0,False

**Volume 7**

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Yukinoshita making tea as I read my paperback.

She poured hot water into the glass pot, and the leaves slowly rose in a dance. The way they fluttered up only to quietly drift down again was reminiscent of the little flecks in a snow globe.

Yukinoshita poured first into the cup, then in the mug, and then, teapot still in hand, she froze. Putting her hand on her chin, she seemed to consider something a moment before reaching out to the paper cups that were always kept in the clubroom and pouring the liquid into one of those, too. She gave the paper cup a cold and dissatisfied glare, even though she was the one responsible for it, then transferred the rest of the tea into a ceramic pot and put a cozy on it to keep it warm.

Then she took her cup and saucer and returned to her seat. Still clacking away on her cell phone, Yuigahama followed suit with her mug.

With no one claiming it, the paper cup was left all alone. The steam rising from it wavered, unsure where to go.

“The tea…will get cold.”

“…My tongue burns easily.” It had taken me a few moments to understand that the cup was for me. But I wasn’t enough of a contrarian that I couldn’t accept something someone went to the effort of leaving for me.

When I figured the tea had cooled a bit, I reached out for it.

As I sipped at my drink, Yuigahama was holding her own mug in both hands and blowing on it to cool it down. “Oh yeah, so it’s about time for the field trip, huh?”

The term made Yukinoshita’s eyebrows twitch. Lately, our class had been talking about nothing else. It seemed those ripples had reached the Service Club, too.

[Page 17-18, He says that he's reading but the amount of info he gleams from the corner of is eye is a bit suspect.]

Maybe Yukinoshita was on that dimension, too, as someone fundamentally equal to Hayama. But for better or for worse, she’s a jerk. She says and does things that ruin her utterly perfect qualities.

[Page 38]

Yuigahama put on a bit of a wry smile, too. “Hmm… It’s true Hayato doesn’t seem like he’d have these problems.”

“Right?” Tobe agreed.

Yukinoshita nodded in response, too, and then gave me a brilliant, beaming smile. “I see. So that’s why you came to consult with Hikigaya.”

“Hey, you’re making it sound like I’m having some massive struggle with relationships,” I snapped back. She said that with such a sweet look on her face.

But Yukinoshita and Yuigahama both looked away.

“…Pff.”

“Agh…”

Yukinoshita breathed a short, pitying sigh, while Yuigahama agreed with a deploring sigh of her own. And then the two of them went silent.

[Page 39]

“Hmm…,” Yukinoshita considered, putting a hand to her chin.

“Obnoxious…? No… Loud? He’s loud, so…perhaps his liveliness.” She gave a bright smile at the end, but she’d completely exposed her thought process in getting to that point.

“…Okay, I get it.” I now knew she would never, ever give anyone a compliment.

She must have been unsatisfied with my reaction, as she then turned the question to me. “Why don’t you think about it?”

“Hey, you can’t squeeze out what isn’t there.”

“…What isn’t there is your motivation.”

[Page 43]

“You even know the geography… Wait—have you been there?” I asked.

For some reason, Yukinoshita gave me a puzzled look. “No.”

“So you looked up all that stuff?”

“The fact that I’ve never been is why I’m looking it up. And besides, we have an opportunity for all of us to go. It’s best to enjoy it,” Yukinoshita said, smiling.

Surprised by her positivity, the only reply I could muster was a weak “Uh-huh.”

She’d softened from before. Yuigahama was probably a big part of that. I think those changes aren’t a bad thing, though. I would just appreciate it if those gentler moments were clearer and more predictable. *You can still have a pretty sharp tongue sometimes, y’know.*

[Page 59]

I was taking my little break with this mild sweetness when a familiar figure appeared in a corner of the lobby. Yukino Yukinoshita was striding in with purpose.
She must have just left the bath, as her hair was tied up and her clothes were unusually casual, for her. She was heading straight for the hotel’s gift shop. She stared at one shelf with a particular intensity… Well, if she was eyeing something that seriously, there was only one thing it could be.

She put a hand to her mouth, considering for a while, before gently reaching out to the item as if she’d made up her mind. But that moment, she noticed what was going on around her. Of course, her eyes met with mine. I’d been watching her the whole time.

Her arm quietly lowered, and then she went back the way she’d come, pretending like she didn’t even know me.

*…The usual.* I said good night to her in my head, sipping away at my remaining café au lait.

[Page 112]

“Here, Yukinoshita.” Miss Hiratsuka gently laid down the serving bowl with some for her. 

Yukinoshita hesitated, but then she took up the chopsticks and china spoon with resolve. Tucking her long hair behind her ear, she lifted the spoon into her mouth. I looked away from the unnecessarily seductive movement of her throat swallowing the thick broth.

She wiped the broth from the corner of her mouth with a napkin, then put on a very serious expression. “…It has a particularly aggressive flavor.”

[Page 119-120]

I replied to her wave with a casually raised hand, and Yukinoshita and I started making our way back toward the hotel. Neither of us deliberately took the first step. We were both silent, but it felt natural.

“…”

“…”

Yukinoshita walked a few steps in front of me. But then her feet suddenly stopped, and she glanced around.

…Well, I could get the gist of what her problem was right then. Call it experience, I guess.

“Take a right.”

“O-oh.” She adjusted Miss Hiratsuka’s coat around her shoulders and ducked her face into the collar to avoid the wind.

I breathed a little snigger of a sigh and started walking ahead of her. I could show her the way, at least. She seemed to get what I was doing, as I heard her footsteps a few paces behind me.

But the sounds gradually diminished.

Confused, I turned around to see that she was farther away than before. “If you hang too far back, you’re gonna get lost again.”

“No…um…”

My bemusement wasn’t getting me a clear answer. As she buried her face in the standing collar of the coat, her voice wilted.

I didn’t at all understand what she was saying, but it’d be a pain if she wandered off and got lost, so I decided to wait for her to come closer.

Yukinoshita and I glared at each other from a distance.

*What are we doing, though…?*

We stood like that for a while, and then she breathed a sigh of resignation.

“I wouldn’t mind if you just went on back ahead of me…,” she muttered, reluctantly coming up to my side.

I wondered if taming a stray cat was like this. “Uh, there’s not really any point, though. It’s not even far.”

“Maybe…not to you, but this makes me uncomfortable,” she said evasively.

Without thinking, I asked, “What does?” Although, honestly, it would have been polite to pretend I didn’t hear the question when it seemed she had so much trouble saying it.

“Um…if we were to be seen together this late…it would be a little…” It wasn’t that cold, but she was adjusting the jacket to hide her face.

“…O-oh.” Once she’d explicitly pointed it out, I had to think about the situation more calmly, too.

We’d met at night before, and we’d met alone. To me, there was not a need to be so overconcerned about it, and it did not bother me, and it was not anything strange. It was a big string of nots.

And along those lines, I’d not ever seen her like this, either.

She was looking every which way, including my feet so she wouldn’t get lost.

I’d never seen her lower her eyes in embarrassment like this, or raise her hand halfway to try to stop me when I went too far ahead and then immediately lower it again.

Her awkwardness started infecting me, too, and unconsciously, my right leg and right arm started swinging forward at the same time. Even though it wasn’t that far, it felt like a really long way to the hotel.

Yukinoshita and I weren’t walking side by side but a fixed distance from each other just out of arm’s reach.

By the time we made it back to the lobby, I was exhausted.

Ahead, there would be students around. If Yukinoshita was concerned about the eyes of others, it would be best to part ways here.

I stopped and casually raised a hand to let her go first. “See you.”

“…Yes, good night… Um…thank you for walking me back,” she replied, then started to leave. Though we were already inside, she was still wearing the coat. She was walking so fast, its sleeves were fluttering.

Wondering if she was going to return the coat, though it didn’t really matter, I returned to my room, too.

[Page 121-123, I loved this scene in the anime too, peak.]

The traditional-style building had a courtyard, too, and we were escorted to the terrace seating. On the terrace, elegantly drinking coffee, was Yukinoshita.

“Oh, you’re late,” she said.

“What? What is this? What’s going on?” Still unable to grasp the situation, the only thought I could come up with was that she looked perfectly natural drinking coffee on a terrace.

“It’s *mouningu.*” Cool and composed, Yukinoshita challenged me with an English vocabulary test.

But of course, I know what morning means, at least. “Uh, I know it’s morning.”

“Not that. I mean a café breakfast, like a morning set, or morning service.”

“Oh, the thing Nagoya’s famous for.” There’s a lot of stuff in Nagoya besides that, like *tenmusu* and the Mountain café and stuff. And people from Nagoya end their sentences with *mya*, so perhaps Yukinoshita thinks they’re felines.

“…Well, let’s go with that.”

“But they have it in Kyoto, too, huh?”

“Yep, yep. And this café is super-famous, too.” Yuigahama summoned the server and quickly finished ordering.

It was true—this elegant storefront appeared to be popular with women.

*Oh, so this is the recommended ladies’ tour Yukinoshita looked up, isn’t it?*

[Page 153-154]

“What’s famous at Toufuku-ji Temple?” Yuigahama asked.

“If you go and see, you’ll know right away.” Yukinoshita giggled. She seemed to be insinuating something. “And after that, Kitano Tenmangu Shrine.”

*…She remembered that random chat we had?*

“Sorry,” I said.

“It’s for Komachi, right?” Yukinoshita said.

“What, what? Does Komachi have something to do with this?”

Yuigahama asked as she munched on her toast.

“I’m praying for Komachi to pass her exams.”

“I knew it… Sister complex…”

*Call it brotherly love. Brotherly love!*

[Page 155-156, cute.]

Finally, we reached the bottom again.

“That was quite crowded…,” Yukinoshita said, sounding weary. It seemed she’d been more affected by the crowds than the hike.

“I’m sure it’ll be about the same from here on out,” I said.

“…” She didn’t say anything, but I could tell from the cold expression on her face that she was already sick of this.

*Lately, I’ve been feeling like I could pass a level-three Yukinoshita certification test.*

[Page 158]

“When a boy is coming to confess his feelings to you,” said Yukinoshita, “you can anticipate it from how much everyone around is tittering about it. You hear what people are saying—whether they be teasing or ridiculing him. Generally, you have precursors before he calls you out to talk.”

“Are you speaking from experience…?” I said. *Oh yeah, I tend to forget it because she’s such a jerk, but the boys do like Yukino Yukinoshita. She is pretty after all*

[Page 159]

“I don’t want those.” Why’d she take just a single bite out of everything? If she’d split one in half, at least, I would have eaten it.

Yuigahama stared hard at the bun and croquette she carried in either hand, then looked at Yukinoshita, nonplussed. “Huh? Then what do I do with these, Yukinon?”

“Agh… I’ll have just a bit.” It was so unusual to see Yukinoshita taking a big bite, I found myself staring. There was something emotional about this, like Yuigahama had tamed a wild fox squirrel.

As I observed this scene, Yukinoshita glared at me. “You help, too.”

“Agh, well, I guess I can eat some.”

“Oh. ’Kay then, here.” Yuigahama tore half off her beef bun and handed it to me.

Well, if that’s how we’re doing it, okay, I guess. I obediently accepted it and tossed it in my mouth.

[Page 163]

One by one, the lanterns lit up on the path of the bamboo woods. The dim white lights illuminated the fresh green stalks, a few paces between each glow. The sun set, and when the moon rose, a pale aura enveloped the area.

If you could visualize kindness, I’m sure it would look something like this.

This mix of coincidence and calculation had been staged, dramatized, and beautifully packaged into the very picture of benevolence itself.

This was the stage that had been set for Tobe.

Everyone was telling little lies in order to construct this situation.

Yuigahama had been the one to call Ebina out here. She’d probably made up some kind of excuse and brought her here.

Ooka and Yamato must have had their own thoughts on the matter. This wasn’t purely about supporting Tobe—they were getting a great show out of this, though they hid it behind their meek expressions.

Even Miura, who wasn’t there, knew what was about to happen, though she didn’t ask about it, didn’t stop it, and was clearly pretending not to notice it.
Hayama wanted to be supportive but couldn’t be. But regardless, he was there.

They were all lying.

The only one of them who wasn’t lying, Yukinoshita, was blank-faced in a rather colder manner than usual.

[Page 171-172]

**Bonus Track (Drama cd set after the events of Volume 6)** 

“All right. Then, Hikigaya, while we’re waiting, why don’t we have you point out the disadvantages?” Seeing Yuigahama’s tenacity, Yukinoshita smiled sweetly and made a malicious suggestion. Well, I went along with it, so that made me a bad guy, too.

“Okay. Well, first of all…it costs money.”

“Penny-pincher…,” Yuigahama muttered sadly in a low tone.

Meanwhile, Yukinoshita was wearing a cheerful, beaming smile. *Aha. I know where this leads.*

“Going straight for the financial argument. I’d expect nothing less from you, Hikigaya.”

“Yeah. Money management is a vital skill for a househusband after all!” I replied with pride.

Looking exasperated, Yukinoshita said, “I meant that sarcastically…”

[Page 189]

“One of you is taking this too seriously… Anyway, we’ve got zero consensus here.” Nobody was making an effort to compromise on anything. *It doesn’t look like anything’s gonna get decided after all.* I was thinking like a spectator, when Yukinoshita suddenly looked at me.

“How about you, then? …Isn’t there anything you’d like to eat?”

“Oh yeah. I guess I didn’t say what I wanted. Nobody ever asks my opinion when I’m in a group, so I forgot to say.”

“What a sad tendency… I believe today, at least, you can state your preference.” For once, Yukinoshita gave me the freedom to say what I wanted. Oh, I normally do, but it was unusual for her to go to the trouble of asking me for my opinion.

*Guess I’ll have my say, then.* “Okay. Then, some kind of carbs,” I requested.

[Page 197-198]

“Indeed it is. Some people are no good even if they don’t party a lot. I won’t name names, though.” Yukinoshita smiled at me.

*Hey, you’re making it pretty explicit here.* “Come on, don’t give me that nice little smile.”

I posted here in August 2024 - the original post is after this update, there’s no new info.

With the exception of one outlet, Desert Companion, the media has done a piss poor job at shedding light on a 22 year old murder case in which my now ex-”husband” murdered an elderly couple, stored their bodies in a storage unit for 12 years while stealing their monthly income.

An article was released in October; it explains the pitfalls of the criminal justice system on the death penalty and the delays it causes along with the emotional impact on the victims.

I’m dealing with major changes in my personal life. My boyfriend of 11 years was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of stomach cancer in October - it’s spread to other organs, is inoperable and we don’t know how much time he has left. He’s very weak and on heavy pain medications. Fortunately, I was able to celebrate the release of the news article with him - one of my major life accomplishments that I’m proud of.

He’s seen how this has impacted me and has been with me throughout the ordeal. Before he leaves this earth, he wants me to have closure, move on and freely talk about my story. I want this, too. 

The good news: I’m finally divorced!

OG post

Hi everyone - I originally wrote this in March 2024, which was when the trial was again cancelled. A trial was set for November 2024 and that has also been cancelled and rescheduled. Please, please share this and hold the courts responsible!

2015 article from Las Vegas Review Journal (with my interview) - [https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/robert-dunns-own-family-wont-weep-if-he-is-put-to-death/](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/robert-dunns-own-family-wont-weep-if-he-is-put-to-death/)

“This is a mindblowing story that spans across multiple decades with multiple victims” - direct quote from the Criminal Investigator for the DA’s office to me. January 29th, 2024 phone conversation beginning at 11:23 am EST, lasting for 16 minutes and 56 seconds.

\*\*The March trial was canceled because it was double booked with another trial.

THE MATH:

TWENTY-TWO YEARS since Joaquine and Eleanor Sierra were murdered, their bodies were put into garbage bins that were stored in a Las Vegas, NV storage unit.

TEN YEARS since he was arrested and still no trial. Multiple cancellations and reschedulings of hearings and trial dates.

The upcoming trial, set for March 18th, 2024 has been canceled…again.

SIXTEEN YEARS since I met him.

A VERY CONFUSING SUMMARY THAT STILL LEAVES OUT A LOT OF DETAILS ON THE CASE: 

Psycho commits multiple murders, fraud, etc. All the bad things, basically. Two of his victims met him prior to their murder - he was their caretaker. Stores bodies in a storage unit from 2003 to 2015 when I led authorities to the bodies. Marries me in 2008 (I was 25, he was 46.) Constant death threats, abuse and control daily. I try to tell people, no one believes me. He was on the run from the time he left me in 2011 to 2015. He is up against the death penalty. 

BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE! I still don’t know the severity of the situation. 

FACTS:

From 2003 to 2015, The Sierras bodies were kept in garbage bins in a Las Vegas storage facility.

He stole their monthly social security deposits and continued to commit fraud against multiple people. 

HE HAS MULTIPLE VICTIMS!

He found the information of dead people via ancestry.com.

I (Joy Ike) married him in 2008. He used a false identity and shortly after our wedding, he told me of his nefarious acts.

He threatened to kill me on a daily basis.

June 4th, 2010 (Long Beach, CA): I placed a 911 phone call telling them that my “husband” had threatened to kill me. What followed was a day of multiple 911 calls where I told them what he had done. Because I’d lost sleep over the threats and abuse, they didn’t believe me. They believed him over me and dismissed me, saying that I was delusional and to get off the phone for real emergencies.

I filled out a report for the release of this phone call in 2015. I received the case number, unfortunately I didn’t follow through. Anything related to Dunn makes me sick.

From the time he fled in 2011 to 2014, STILL no one believed me.

In 2014, two special agents from social security knocked on my door. Before they said anything, I asked them if they were here to question me about Dunn, the Sierras and if I knew anything as to their whereabouts.

I gave them so much info as well as where I thought the Sierras were.

ONE OR TWO DAYS LATER, THEY CAME BACK AND CONFIRMED!

The very first thing they said was, “You cracked the case”.

I’m still married to this mother fucker! HE HAS REFUSED TO DIVORCE ME! HOW IS THIS A LEGAL MARRIAGE?!? (I could explain but I’ll do that shit later.)

Robert Dixon Dunn was arrested in 2015. He is up against the death penalty.

I repeat, again: HE IS STILL SITTING IN JAIL AWAITING TRIAL! A cornucopia of cancellations and reschedulings of meetings and trial dates have been involved and he has managed to manipulate the court system to HIS advantage. 

WHY AM I WRITING ABOUT THIS?!?

It’s unfair to the victims (me included) that Robert Dixon Dunn is able to manipulate the system. How does he have a choice in what happens to him when his victims had none?

I need for this information to be shared. I need someone who will care about this case as much as I do. I need support and to not feel like I’m alone. I’m looking for someone who has the ability to actually bring attention to this matter.

The next trial date is set for April 7th, 2025 - what are the odds that it will happen this time?!?

I posted here in August 2024 - the original post is after this update, there’s no new info.

With the exception of one outlet, Desert Companion, the media has done a piss poor job at shedding light on a 22 year old murder case in which my now ex-”husband” murdered an elderly couple, stored their bodies in a storage unit for 12 years while stealing their monthly income.

An article was released in October; it explains the pitfalls of the criminal justice system on the death penalty and the delays it causes along with the emotional impact on the victims. [https://knpr.org/desert-companion/2024-10-07/waiting-for-justice](https://knpr.org/desert-companion/2024-10-07/waiting-for-justice)

I’m dealing with major changes in my personal life. My boyfriend of 11 years was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of stomach cancer in October - it’s spread to other organs, is inoperable and we don’t know how much time he has left. He’s very weak and on heavy pain medications. Fortunately, I was able to celebrate the release of the news article with him - one of my major life accomplishments that I’m proud of.

He’s seen how this has impacted me and has been with me throughout the ordeal. Before he leaves this earth, he wants me to have closure, move on and freely talk about my story. I want this, too. 

The good news: I’m finally divorced!

Once again, I’m asking you to push the Clark County court to get their shit and calendars in order and share this information with whoever you can. Here’s their contact information:

Criminal Investigator Jamie Honaker (702) 671-2829

Clark County DA: Steve Wolfson 702-671-2700

OG post

Hi everyone - I originally wrote this in March 2024, which was when the trial was again cancelled. A trial was set for November 2024 and that has also been cancelled and rescheduled. Please, please share this and hold the courts responsible!

2015 article from Las Vegas Review Journal (with my interview) - [https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/robert-dunns-own-family-wont-weep-if-he-is-put-to-death/](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/robert-dunns-own-family-wont-weep-if-he-is-put-to-death/)

“This is a mindblowing story that spans across multiple decades with multiple victims” - direct quote from the Criminal Investigator for the DA’s office to me. January 29th, 2024 phone conversation beginning at 11:23 am EST, lasting for 16 minutes and 56 seconds.

\*\*The March trial was canceled because it was double booked with another trial.

THE MATH:

TWENTY-TWO YEARS since Joaquine and Eleanor Sierra were murdered, their bodies were put into garbage bins that were stored in a Las Vegas, NV storage unit.

TEN YEARS since he was arrested and still no trial. Multiple cancellations and reschedulings of hearings and trial dates.

The upcoming trial, set for March 18th, 2024 has been canceled…again.

SIXTEEN YEARS since I met him.

A VERY CONFUSING SUMMARY THAT STILL LEAVES OUT A LOT OF DETAILS ON THE CASE: 

Psycho commits multiple murders, fraud, etc. All the bad things, basically. Two of his victims met him prior to their murder - he was their caretaker. Stores bodies in a storage unit from 2003 to 2015 when I led authorities to the bodies. Marries me in 2008 (I was 25, he was 46.) Constant death threats, abuse and control daily. I try to tell people, no one believes me. He was on the run from the time he left me in 2011 to 2015. He is up against the death penalty. 

BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE! I still don’t know the severity of the situation. 

FACTS:

From 2003 to 2015, The Sierras bodies were kept in garbage bins in a Las Vegas storage facility.

He stole their monthly social security deposits and continued to commit fraud against multiple people. 

HE HAS MULTIPLE VICTIMS!

He found the information of dead people via ancestry.com.

I (Joy Ike) married him in 2008. He used a false identity and shortly after our wedding, he told me of his nefarious acts.

He threatened to kill me on a daily basis.

With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), online retailers have unlocked new avenues to personalize the shopping experience, optimize sales, and enhance customer satisfaction. Among the most promising applications of AI in this space are AI agents, which are revolutionizing how businesses interact with their customers and manage operations.

This article delves into the ways [AI agents ](https://duanex.com/ai-agents/)are reshaping e-commerce, focusing on three core areas: personalization, product recommendations, and customer service. We’ll explore how these advancements are driving growth, enhancing user experiences, and positioning companies to meet the evolving demands of today’s consumers.

https://preview.redd.it/fgjqazwmi3je1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e3864475bdc492db49e7472302f15c2cf84c6b2

# Understanding Personalization Through AI Agents

Personalization is at the heart of successful e-commerce strategies. AI agents use machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP), and behavioral analytics to tailor experiences based on individual user preferences. Unlike static segmentation methods of the past, AI-driven personalization adapts in real-time, ensuring every interaction feels unique and relevant.

# Data-Driven Insights

AI agents collect and analyze vast amounts of data from various touchpoints, including browsing history, purchase behavior, and even social media interactions. This data enables e-commerce platforms to:

* **Create personalized landing pages:** AI agents can dynamically generate content for users based on their past interactions, increasing the likelihood of conversions.
* **Offer targeted promotions:** Discounts and offers are tailored to individual preferences, maximizing their appeal.

For example, Amazon’s recommendation engine—powered by AI—accounts for up to 35% of its total sales. It’s a testament to how personalization enhances engagement and drives revenue.

# Dynamic Pricing Strategies

AI agents also enable dynamic pricing models, where prices fluctuate based on factors such as demand, competition, and user behavior. This strategy ensures customers feel they are receiving fair value while maximizing profits for businesses.

# Product Recommendations: Beyond Basic Suggestions

Gone are the days of generic product recommendations. Today, AI agents employ sophisticated algorithms like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models to deliver hyper-relevant suggestions. These systems predict what a customer might want based on their preferences and the behavior of similar users.

# Context-Aware Recommendations

Context-awareness is a game-changer. AI agents analyze:

* **Time of day:** Recommending coffee in the morning or fitness gear in the New Year’s resolution period.
* **Geolocation:** Suggesting winter wear to users in colder climates while promoting beachwear to users in tropical regions.
* **Seasonal trends:** AI agents monitor trends in real-time to recommend products that align with seasonal preferences or current events.

# Visual Search and Recommendation Systems

AI-powered visual search allows users to upload images and find similar products instantly. This feature caters to shoppers who know what they want but struggle to describe it verbally. AI agents further enhance this experience by suggesting complementary products, enabling seamless cross-selling and upselling.

# The Role of Chatbots and Virtual Assistants 

[AI chatbots and virtual assistants ](https://duanex.com/blog/ai-agents-in-customer-support-real-world-use-cases-and-benefits/)have redefined customer service in e-commerce. Available 24/7, these AI agents handle a variety of tasks, such as:

* **Answering FAQs:** Providing instant responses to common queries.
* **Order tracking:** Keeping customers informed about their purchases.
* **Problem resolution:** Assisting with refunds, exchanges, or technical issues.

By reducing the reliance on human agents for repetitive tasks, businesses can allocate resources to more complex customer needs.

# Sentiment Analysis for Better Communication

AI agents equipped with sentiment analysis tools can detect a customer’s emotional state through their text or voice interactions. This capability allows businesses to:

* Escalate issues to human agents when necessary.
* Provide empathetic and contextually appropriate responses.

# Multilingual Support

Global e-commerce requires catering to diverse linguistic audiences. AI agents equipped with NLP capabilities can interact with customers in multiple languages, breaking down communication barriers and broadening market reach.

# AI Beyond the Front End: Operational Efficiencies

AI agents are not just improving customer-facing aspects of e-commerce; they’re also streamlining backend operations. From inventory management to supply chain optimization, AI plays a pivotal role in ensuring businesses run smoothly.

# Inventory Management

AI agents can predict stock requirements based on historical sales data, current trends, and external factors like weather patterns or economic shifts. This reduces instances of overstocking or understocking, saving costs and improving customer satisfaction.

# Fraud Detection

Fraudulent activities are a significant concern for online retailers. AI agents equipped with advanced anomaly detection systems can:

* Identify suspicious transactions.
* Alert administrators in real-time.
* Mitigate risks associated with chargebacks and payment fraud.

# Logistics Optimization

AI-driven route optimization ensures timely deliveries while reducing costs. By analyzing traffic patterns, weather conditions, and delivery schedules, AI agents help logistics teams achieve maximum efficiency.

# Word from Duanex

AI agents are transforming the e-commerce industry, creating highly personalized, efficient, and engaging shopping experiences. By leveraging AI for personalization, product recommendations, and customer service, businesses are not only meeting customer expectations but also driving significant revenue growth.

As[ technology continues to evolve](https://duanex.com/technologies/), the integration of AI agents will become even more sophisticated, offering endless possibilities for innovation. For e-commerce companies, embracing AI is no longer an option—it’s a necessity to stay competitive in a fast-paced, customer-centric market.
