2: 1 optional IRL character per roster (debut not created)

3: But no IRL politics. |

4: Anime is allowed|

5: (can't believe I'm saying it but) actual sentient characters only. (blame PMK-3 for me establishing this rule) |

6: characters that people know, people like a random person who isn't named enjoying a coffee and is never shown again won't count (blame PMK-3 for me establishing this rule) |

7: don't downvote, if you see a submission you don't like, ignore it, don't downvote it. |

I usually add the character at around 7:00 PM (in Massachusetts time) (or 1 hour before I post)|

1nmeliy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nmeliy/electric_kettle_vs_immersion_heater_pros_and_cons/,Electric kettle vs immersion heater: pros and cons?,"Hey everyone! I've been using both electric kettles and immersion heaters for years, and I thought I'd share my experience to help those who are on the fence about which one to choose.

I remember when I first moved into my apartment, I was using an immersion heater because that's what my mom always used. But let me tell you, switching to an electric kettle was a game-changer for my daily routine.

First, let's talk about safety. Immersion heaters can be pretty risky - I've had a few close calls with electrocution scares (not fun!). Electric kettles are way safer since they're completely enclosed and have automatic shut-off features. I recently got this awesome electric kettle (https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle) that turns off instantly when the water boils, which gives me peace of mind.

Energy efficiency is another big factor. Immersion heaters waste a lot of electricity because they're basically heating the surrounding air too. Electric kettles are more efficient since they're insulated and heat water directly. Plus, they're faster - my kettle boils water in about 3-4 minutes, while immersion heaters usually take 8-10 minutes.

Here's what I love about my electric kettle:
- Temperature control (perfect for different types of tea)
- Keep-warm function
- No weird metallic taste in the water
- Easy to clean
- Portable (great for travel)

The downsides? Well, electric kettles are initially more expensive, but they last longer and save money on electricity bills. Some cheaper models can be noisy, but premium ones like this one (https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle) are pretty quiet.

As for immersion heaters:
Pros:
- Super cheap
- Can heat small amounts of water
- Work in any container

Cons:
- Safety hazards
- Slow heating
- No temperature control
- Can damage containers
- Often leave deposits in water

My verdict? Electric kettles win hands down. They're safer, more efficient, and honestly make better-tasting beverages. The initial investment is worth it for the convenience and peace of mind alone.

Been using my electric kettle for everything from my morning coffee to instant noodles, and I can't imagine going back to immersion heaters. If you're still using an immersion heater, I'd seriously consider making the switch.

""The streets ran over, a deluge of the sick hypocrisy from the very core of the city. The cold was a reminder. No one was safe, not until they got out of this web of lies. These few were the lucky ones. They had me--""

""...did you say something?""

Blank paused, glaring at one of the two hostages in tow. His mumbling monologue had been interrupted right as they reached the front door of the building. Simply awful timing. What kind of amateurs was he being made to work with? He gestured with a sigh to the doorway as both of them bolted without a word. 

The struggles of a method actor. At least they managed to hit their marks.

""Beg your pardon, a question if you don't mind me askin'.""

Blank jumped at the gravely voice behind him. The visage of a stout detective landed on the final step of the main stairwell, two shivering and thoroughly confused hostages just behind him. ""Now accordin' to these folks-- thank you, by the way, you're free to go..."" At a wave of the shambling being's 'arm', the still-terrified pair bolted for the door without a word. 

""Accordin' to these folks, these kidnappings are totally random. Neither of them knew why they were brought here. Now I was hopin' one of your three could help establish some kind of motive--""

""...I had two."" Blank interrupted. 

The pair shared a tense silence as they both realized the same thing. Just as the actor began to shake himself out for one more scene, the lost hostage slid into view on the staircase before leaping down the final flight and quickly disappearing through the exit. ""GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU WEIRDOS!""

Stunned, the pair looked at one another. The detective put an exasperated hand on his head as he sighed. The nerve of some people.

""You were saying something about a motive?"" Blank turned to the cockeyed detective. ""You think these people were just taken for the hell of it?""

PK shook its head. ""No, no. Far from it. See, I was able to do a bit of diggin' with all that runnin' around earlier. Found the darndest thing."" The pulsating mass of worms shuttered for a moment before a small stack of papers emerged from an outstretched appendage, handing them over to the actor. 

As he flipped through them, Blank was only made more confused. Each one was a random scrawling of barely legible reminder notes. 'Report to Elstree', 'x2 watches x4 phone x2 wallet $447', a few doodles of some kind of pirate flag and a long-nosed cartoon looking over a wall... It was junk, from what he could tell. ""...are these meant to explain something?"" 

""Other than someone's boredom, I doubt it. What I find interesting is the paper itself."" Leach tapped the top of the notes: an ornate, official-looking header adorned the top of each piece of paper. ""Those are government papers. Hell of a choice of stationary for some group of mercenaries, not exactly easy to find outside of, uhh..."" He leaned in to get a closer read of the coat of arms on each one. ""...Cuba, I believe.""

Blank raised an eyebrow, suddenly holding the papers with more care. Hopefully no one would check these things for fingerprints. ""You're saying *Cuba* has its hands in all this?""

""Now I'm not saying anything. The papers are doin' all the sayin' around here."" PK pointed a finger at Blank, wagging it knowingly. ""But I can think of a few groups who may have something to say about all this.”

**Scenario: Mariel, Cuba — 10:00 AM**

The ocean waves rolled gently on the horizon line, the yellow-orange glow of sunset reflecting off the sapphire swell. Sitting with a severe expression, staring at this beautiful majesty, was a severe-looking man in a business suit, eyes pointed ever-forwards from behind his glasses. Maximo Compay rested on a small bench a few dozen meters from the beach, a small sheet of square paper in his hands, which he folded idly. He fiddled with it idly, waiting for the meeting he had set up. There were some people in the distance, but at this hour, the surroundings were quiet, and he had vision in all directions. Ideal if he needed to make a quick exit.

“You wished to speak with us, Agent Compay?”

A woman’s voice spoke out from behind him, one which he had grown steadily to detest. He turned his head slightly, glancing to see the figures of a man and a woman approaching him, and before he could voice a word, sitting with him on the bench. He bit his tongue slightly.

“I wished to speak with *you*, Elstree,” He let his glare linger on the other man here, the one he had understood the others referred to as the ‘Pool Boy’, for just a moment, before his gaze once more fell on Elstree. “But given these past few weeks, this petty insubordination almost seems quaint.”

A smile crept to the woman’s face. “You certainly have picked a place with a wonderful view, Handler.” Elstree deftly deflected the agent’s jab, staring down at his hands. “Origami? Is that a new passion of yours, Compay?”

The Agent took a deep breath. “... I am currently in San Jose, California. An ally of our government is indisposed, and so I am offering him an alibi.” He folded his paper once, then twice, then thrice with practiced precision. “Each day, in the early evening, he rides his bike to a local park, and folds origami there for between two and three hours. On one occasion, he was only able to indulge in this hobby for forty-seven minutes before being called away, but otherwise he has never stayed for less than an hour and fifty minutes in the past two years.” Another three folds. In his hands, what had once been a square of paper now took the form of a crane. “He first took up this hobby seven years ago, but has never been formally trained. When he makes his folds, he places too much pressure between his thumb and forefinger, and runs his hand across the lines of the fold far too quickly. Because of this, on every piece of origami he folds, the crease lines end up highly visible, damaging the overall quality of the piece.” Compay stood up suddenly, examining the paper crane. “... Ms. Elstree.” He turned to her, expression blank. “Mrs. Elstree?”

“Captain Elstree.” She confirmed sternly, leaning forwards.

“Captain Elstree,” he continued, “I do not expect other people to maintain the level of precision I prefer to operate with. It is simply not realistic to ask everyone with whom I work to maintain the same eye for detail, and I have come to peace with that,” All motion stopped for a moment, as he swiveled to stare at the two Fortunate Sons directly. “But what I do expect, what I do demand, is professionalism. It is discipline. It is that the group which we have hired to act as peacekeepers, at no small expense, are capable of keeping the peace. You were brought on because your connections and credentials indicated you would be capable of all of these things.” His eyes narrowed. “This was a mistake.”

“Agent Company, mate…” Elstree began, pushing back a grimace into a pained smile. “We have already been holding back *plenty*, as per your requests- and despite the obvious loss in *efficiency* because of it, we’ve still-” 

“Stop.” The Handler interrupted. “You two are speaking as though these excuses still have time to matter. The decision has already been made.” He turned away from them, staring once more at the shoreline. “All of my other obligations have been placed on hold; starting now, I will be assuming direct control of your operations in the region. Your movement across borders and through National Waters now must go through me. You are not to take action without my direct approval.” He paused briefly, to add more weight to his words. “No more unregistered outside help. No more flights of fancy. No more chaos.” Before the two he was lecturing could get a word in, he began walking towards the shoreline. “Meeting is adjourned. I will be sending your first marching orders this time tomorrow. Failure to comply with this change in structure will be met with an immediate termination of our agreement.”Before he left earshot completely, he turned one last time, to issue his final threat. “Furthermore, you will be considered enemies of the region, and I will personally see to it that if you and your band of pirates so much as splash the waters within a hundred miles of the Lesser Antilles, you will have the armies of five nations aimed at your heads.” He stepped away, feeling his point had been made.

As he left, Elstree was obviously fuming. Frederick merely held his place beside her, his face as stoney as ever. The captain’s knuckles turned bone white as she clenched them into fists with all her might.

“Wanker. Right proper fuckin’ wanker.” She growled. “Someone oughta show him what those insides of his look like when they’re outsides.”

“Try and keep calm, captain.” Frederick said, his voice steady. “While we’ve never had a client so… Prissy, he’s far from the worst we’ve had. We’ll figure out how to deal with him.” He pulled something out of his pocket, a cheap cigarette. He flicked it over into Elstree’s hand.

“We always do. In fact, I think I might know how to turn this in our favor. Just keep calm and do as he says… You’ll know when I’ve made my move. Trust me- I know precisely what to do. Such is my duty, my power as the **”Lifeguard.”**

---

Compay reached the waterline. He stared at the natural beauty of the sunset for just a moment, before leaning down and placing his paper swan on the water, to be pulled out into the great unknown. As he rose, he noticed something in the corner of his eye, tucked underneath the sand. He reached for it, wiping it with a hand towel he grabbed from his pocket, and held it up to the light as he stared. As blue as the ocean swell, he saw his own eye reflected in the saltwater sapphire. His grip tightened as he stared at it; in the beauty, he saw reflected the death and destruction that the search for these sapphires had left in its wake. He saw his own face morph into an unfamiliar shape; for the emotionless agent, the grimace of pure frustration he saw was startling, and he realized with a jolt of pain and the taste of iron that he had bitten his own lip so hard as to draw blood.

Without a second though, he squeezed the gemstone in his hand, reeled back, and tossed it as far as he could into the sea, to be lost in the ocean forevermore.

**Scenario: Key West, Florida — 3:14 PM, The Day Before**

“...so, after that [doctor dragged me away](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1n3npbn/) with some kind of gadget, we fought for a while until they just…disappeared,” Sara continued regaling her tale to Maybelline and Tikka Masala, the three sat together at a local café. “Broke any way of contacting you guys—as well as stabbing me a *lot*—leaving me alone to make my way out of the wetlands.”

Maybe leaned back on their seat, swirling around their cup of coffee. “Guess we should be grateful we managed to hear that you’d found yourself up here. The Captain beating up that shadow guy gave us no clue at all.” 

“Wait, she beat him? Hell yeah, bastard had it coming. What did you find out from his ship though?”

Tikka sighed as the two discussed the outcome of their captain’s battle, as well as what the crew had been up to afterwards. She would rather be anywhere else rather than stuck in a conversation. Unfortunately, she had been dragged out by both Maybe and the Captain in joining them on reconvening with their crewmate (something, something, “everyone else has gone out to do stuff”), so here she was by all means socialising. At least the cafe had good drinks.

Eventually, Sara had been caught up with the Ghost Rider’s activities, and it was time to discuss what she had been up to. “Well,” she began. “Since I was near where their plans had been, I figured I would try and mess some stuff up for them. Stealing shipments, smashing up projects, small things to hinder them. However, there’s something big they’re setting up that we might want to take down.”

At this, Maybe leaned in—while they did see the best in people, they also tended to see the worst, and what they’ve seen and heard of the Fortunate Sons, their opinion leant towards the latter. “Surely can’t be more crazy than a seance: what’ve you got?”

“So you know these guys have been hired by the Cuban government, right?” Sara pulled out a map, pointing at an area in the ocean. “The Sons have decided to make use of an oil rig that the Cubans own, setting up a huge smuggling operation.”

“…Smuggling?” Tikka tilted her head. “Like, the Uropeh [they had been gathering shipments of](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1myhbno/)? Or some normal stuff.”

“Didn’t get to find that out,” Sara sighed. “Probably more Uropeh—that or more cash to fund their efforts.”

That caused Maybe to grit their teeth. “Of course it’d be money…”

“You say that as if we’re not pirates ourselves,” Sara retorted.

The ‘elephant in the room’ besides them, the 15-foot tall Stand Knight, was staring at the map before coming to a decision—placing a hand on Tikka’s shoulder to declare it. ｢My Lady, I think it is imperative that we destroy this operation before it begins!｣

While Tikka quickly shook her head to deny that idea, Maybe nodded theirs in agreement. “Those guys have menaced us sailors for long enough—we should knock ‘em down another peg, at least for payback for what they did to you Sara. Wanna come with?”

Sara sighed. “I’d love to, but I’ve got some cuts that need more time to heal. Bloody doctor with her scalpel…trust me, I’ll have my own payback on her soon enough. You should take Tikka with you.”

Tikka sputtered. “M-me!? No, I can’t, I—”

“Tikka, your Stand will be perfect. Just let ‘em loose—tear that operation to shreds!”

The woman slumped into her chair—well, looks like she’s going to help regardless. Though as she thought it through, she realised it would mean she’ll be getting some money out of it…

“Sure,” she relented. “I suppose I can help out.”

｢Excellent decision, my lady,｣ her Stand proclaimed. ｢By my honour, those villains’ plans shall be laid to rest!｣

That put a sour taste in her mouth: Tikka never really liked what ｢Silver Mountain Man｣ considered as ‘honor’—far too much violence. She only hoped as the group began packing up to head back to the ship and plan that whatever would happen they wouldn’t need her to fight.

**Scenario: The** ***Sunk Cost,*** **Near the Coast of Cuba - 2:14 PM**

Rachel could not stop fiddling with the gem in her hand. These things, these sapphire spheres that the fat cat had suddenly gotten so obsessed over, had been the only thing this team was chasing the last few weeks. The “boss” had the crewmates running all over snapping these things up in auctions, pawn shops, contests, or just outright thievery. But very little of that constituted treasure hunting. In fact, the last time they actually tried treasure hunting, Rachel had nearly gotten her shot at exploring the unknown supernatural powers of a long-lost artifact… only to get blown away by a bit of wind! Ella ended up being able to catch the storm calling Uropeh at the center of the issue, but that left Rachel handling nothing but boat rentals!

Today, however, she sat across from Cassidy Norton, the “man in the chair” behind most of their operations, and Ian Yang, their “nautical specialist.” It was time to take some initiative.

“You want Millenium Mother to look up… shipping lane movements..?” Cassidy looked at her confusedly. 

“You got it!” Rachel replied enthusiastically. “With the Gemstone City buzz, artifact trading’s been skyrocketing in these areas. Now, if you ask me, plenty of these merchants aren’t the type of people I trust with ancient artifacts… so I think it's fine if I go and take them off their hands.”

As Cassidy formulated a response, Millennium Mother interjected on his behalf. “This course of action has not been authorized by Baxter, Rachel. Are you certain that we’ll be able-”

“Hey, I’ll be fine! You remember who put this team together in the first place, don’t you?” Rachel looked back with an excited smile. “Besides, I’m tired of relying on Baxter’s whole ‘money and status’ shtick. He tries to hold the incident over us just so he can keep things stable and in control, even if it costs us good opportunities to find something truly unique. It was his ego who got us busted by the Blue Market anyway.”

Cassidy attempted to interject, muttering “But weren’t you the one that overreached over that cheap old rock..?” before MM cut him off once again. “You are correct that Li’l Baxter is likely unnecessary for this operation. While his internet data plan provides me many luxuries… I agree that there is much that we are missing. Analyzing shipping lanes near Cuba now.”

Ian, for the first time, spoke up. “So… in short, you’re looking to assert your relevance as a thorn on his side, is that it?” He looked to Rachel, raising a doubtful eyebrow. 

Rachel shrugged to him dismissively. “I guess you could put it that way… not that I want to cause problems for him specifically. Just that I have my motives outside of his obsession.”

Ian’s mouth curled into a small grin as he looked down and closed his eyes. “I see… hm. How impulsive of you. I guess that’s to be expected for someone with your resume… but to be frank, the path you’ll walk won’t be easy.”

Rachel grimaced as she understood what Ian was going to say next. “As such, I’ll be going with you. To cut through the waves of the sea is to remain firm against the tides of the most powerful force… a skill you will need to practice to challenge these seabound merchants.”

Rachel sighed exasperatedly. “Ian, you’re just planning on coming so you can make this harder for me, aren’t you? We’re finally in the Caribbean, and I’m just trying to get something done here!”

Interrupting their conversation, Millennium Mother finally replies to Rachel’s initial request. “Shipping movements near Cuba have been isolated. Non-government trade ships moving within the North Cuba Foreland Basin appear to be converging on an offshore oil rig. Lack of identification suggests them to be smuggling ships. Recent activity suggests contact with the archaeology group known as the ‘Fortunate Sons.’”

Rachel looked up curiously. “Those guys..? An archaeology group? Hah, so that’s what they call themselves. Guess we’re getting back to those guys after all.”

Ian looked out to the ocean, quietly musing. “Those people… Baxter captured the competition he had with their chef. I am glad that he was there to teach that thug a lesson, but if the others are anything like him… I don’t think anyone would mind seeing them fall.”

Rachel met his eyes with a glare of confidence. “So we’re on the same page about that, at least. I hope that means you’re gonna play along.”

Ian met hers with a resolve of his own. “You want to assert yourself as a leader in the treasure hunting world. I won’t stop you from getting your treasure or taking these guys down a notch; but if you want to be a leader, then surely you should be capable of leading even me.”

Rachel crossed her arms and nodded. “Well… at least your swimming skills will be useful. Cassidy, give us a course. I’ll get us a boat.”

**Scenario: An offshore oil rig, Near the Coast of Cuba — 3:58 PM**

“Damn…” Rachel muttered, the duo’s small craft pulling up to the oil rig. Readily apparent was the much larger ship already docked; they could recognize it by their ally Nathanial’s [previous encounter](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1ma85is/jojos_bizarre_oc_tournament_8_r1m4_azumi_ryuzaki/?), this was the Highwind for sure.

“Pirates, too. This isn’t going to be easy.” she sighed. They pulled their craft astride the rig and tied it off, beginning to scale up the side.

Ahead, guards armed with rifles patrolled the catwalks that lined the side of the dense construction. They didn’t seem too organized as of yet, at least, so with their collective Stand abilities they shouldn’t be too difficult to handle…

“Treasure Number One… Gold!”

Ian lept from the side of the rig onto the platform and kicked with one fluid motion, downing the guard instantly with an explosion of kinetic energy. The guards confusedly radioed to each other and attempted to coordinate as Ian ran them down. Before they had time to make a call, he was on top of another.

“Treasure Number Four… Iron!”

His iron hammer disarmed the man in one blow, leaving him open to a whirling roundhouse kick to the floor. Rachel looked up at the scene of chaos, weapons drawn before she could even act or caution against it.

“We’re here to take their artifacts, Ian, not beat them up one by one! Couldn’t we have done this any easier?”

Ian, for just a brief moment, looks over to her, almost condescendingly as he drops another guard with a pressure point strike. “That’s the point, Rachel. If you want to do something…”

Three guards faced him down. If Ian was tired yet, he didn’t show it. “You had better do it the hard way.”

Rachel, having rappelled her way onto the platform, pulled a man back with a gust of air only to send him to the floor with a punch. “Well, I guess I can’t just abandon you, can I?”

A few more guards came their way; shots were fired, several able to graze Ian. Blood was strewn across his shoulder and arms, where most of the damage was taken. Nonetheless, the two were able to handle the guards coming their way until two more figures came their way. They were obviously not guards, given their street clothes and lack of weapons… but they didn’t exactly seem to be friendly either. At least, not Tikka, who responded with an exasperated indignance.

“Who the hell are you people..?” she muttered as she approached. Rachel looked back at her expecting a fight, but their posture didn’t seem particularly hostile.

“Oh, uh, hello,” Rachel said quickly. “Are you guys… the pirates?”

Maybe nodded. “Yeah. We’re here to take down a criminal ring. You guys got a problem with that?”

Rachel shrugged. “Not really. We’re here to get the stolen artifacts that were collected here off the boat and back into the hands of people that can take care of them. Now, if we don’t have an issue, my teammate here has already caused enough problems, so I’ll be off now.”

As she turned around, however, Tikka’s voice rang out again. “Hey, hold on a second…”

…before being interrupted by the clanging sound of metallic footsteps. This quickly got Rachel’s attention; in an instant, she whirled around at the gigantic sound only to see a truly massive swordsman standing behind Tikka. A deep voice rumbled from beneath the thick armor.

“｢Are these the enemies we seek, my lady?｣” The behemoth practically pushed Tikka aside as it drew its blade, pointing it towards the treasure hunters. “｢Do not expect any mercy from me, fools!｣”

Tikka muttered under her breath. “No, dumbass! I don’t even know who these guys-”

“Hah…” Ian scoffed. “I should have expected something a bit more powerful to oppose us! Fine then, pirates! Have at you!” Without hesitation, Ian ran headlong towards the colossal knight, a second wind empowering his rush forward. In the moment the knight reached upwards for a strike… Ian unleashed a barrage of strikes.

“Treasure Number Three, Bronze! Ha! Hoo! Treasure Number Five, Agate! Ha! Hih! Treasure Number Two, Silver!”

A quick flurry of over ten hits in a row staggered the knight backwards. Ian stood firm on the ground, and pointed a finger accusatorily at Tikka.

“You’d have this knight stand and take these blows in your stead? Hm… people like you make me sick. I ought to show you a real challenge..!”

As he approached Tikka, however, the knight had managed to raise its sword above its head.

“｢Approach… no further..!｣”

Ian was given barely any time to react as the force of gravity did its work. He called upon the technique designed for this situation as he held his palm back, ready for a strike.

“Treasure Number Seven… J-”

The sword fell upon him before he could recite his full incantation. While the strike deflected some of the blade’s power, preventing him from being cleft in two, Ian was nonetheless brought to the floor. All three spectators watched in shock as Ian fell to his knees, covered in blood.

“You… what do you think you’re doing?!” Rachel yelled out at the knight. “You were really trying to kill him, weren’t you?”

Tikka defensively bit back. “Not like your crazy friend wasn’t coming at me either! This guy, it’s… it's got no idea what it's doing, okay? I don’t care what you people are doing, just get off my ass about this, and we can all move on with our lives, okay?”

Maybe nodded. “We’re all after the same thing, at the end of the day. We’ve got no reason to fight over this.”

Rachel, however, continued to stare daggers at the Stand. “Maybe so… but I don’t really know if I can trust you guys with this one. If this thing is supposed to be under your control, and this is what happens, how am I supposed to expect you’ll really keep those artifacts safe and preserved?”

Tikka scowled. “Oh, so that’s your issue..? You’re gonna stop us from taking these guys down over *that?*”

Rachel turned to Tikka and pointed an accusatory finger. “If that wasn’t enough, then your knight nearly killing my associate did it for me.” She stepped in front of Ian, who was still breathing heavily as he attempted to stay conscious. “I might not be able to beat you, but I can stop that thing, at least!”

Ian’s voice, however, trembled out of his throat. “So… you’re resolving to fight, Rachel? Heh…” He coughed violently as he attempted to formulate his words. “In that case… it’d be wrong of me not to go all out either.”

Maybe looked to Ian on the ground. “Hey, you should really be helping out your friend instead of… whatever this is.”

Ian, however, slowly began to rise to his feet. “Oh..? You think I need help? I don’t think so… because I haven’t even reached my final form..!”

Balling his hands together into two fists, Ian began to chant solemnly. “Sleeping stone… worn away by crashing waves…”

All spectators stood back as Ian’s body began to emit a tremendous amount of energy. His voice, echoing with power, finally called out.

“AWAKEN FROM DUKKHA! ｢BODHICITTA｣!”

The energy around him began to coalesce: a rigid humanoid form began to take shape behind him. As the bright energy faded, the statuesque shape of ｢Bodhicitta｣ fully manifested itself.

｢Silver Mountain Man｣ lifted its sword with ferocity. “｢Ah, now this is a worthy challenge! Face the death knight with all your might, warrior!｣”

Rachel and Maybe simply stared at each other in irritation. It was clear on each other’s faces that this was not the outcome they wanted. Maybe saw in Rachel a genuine, straightforward honesty: she really just wanted to preserve these treasures, from the bottom of her heart. But at the same time, she knew the flipside to that mindset. Of someone who would gladly shunt all other morality out of the way in the name of their goals. Someone who could do great harm if not tempered.

Standing alongside the statue and the knight, ｢The Sunset Tree｣ blossomed in her peripheral vision.

Rachel put her fists together as the Stands came together. “Welp, guess I’ll just have to prove myself to you all, too!”

**“OPEN THE GAME!”**

**Location:** A small dilapidated oil rig off the coast of Cuba! The area here is 57x102m, with each tile being 3x3m. The oil rig consists of two floors - a somewhat enclosed [lower level](https://i.imgur.com/Qh1DL7G.jpeg), and a relatively open [upper level](https://i.imgur.com/ZWkOCwt.jpeg). The upper level is roughly 5m above the lower level, and the lower level is roughly 15m above sea level.

The lower level of the rig is a combination of a living area, storage, and machinery. Starting from the far west of the map and moving east there is the pumping station, machinery room, bunks and living space, storage room, and supply drop off. Surrounding the entire area is a rickety series of grated catwalks suspended against the ocean, with a few segments that have already plummeted into the sea.

The main pumping station where oil is drawn up from the ocean floor into the platform. There is a large pump and several storage drums from which the oil is pumped into the storage containers depicted on the top floor can be found.

Next to that is the machinery and control room where consoles and machinery control the flow from the tanks on the first floor up through the walls and ceiling and into tanks above. The shelves in this room have spare parts and tools on them stored in wooden crates. The large grey machine is the main electrical and hydraulic control system, along with the control console next to it.

The living area is split into the bunks on the north and the living space to the south. The bunkroom contains a series of wooden bunk beds with feather mattresses and ratty blankets. Under each bed is a small storage container full of miscellaneous personal items. The living space contains a few desks with computers, a standard wooden pool table, two long tables with benches and a small kitchen setup. The crates in this room contain rations, extra clean water, clothing and cleaning supplies.

The storage room contains nothing more than shelves of spare parts and extra food and water and a forklift. As of the match the forklift is in working order and has a set of spare tires tucked away near its starting position. The adjacent storage deck contains four shipping crates and a number of canisters of compressed air. The northern containers are used for delivering food and tools, while the ones to the south contain spare parts.

The second floor is comparatively simple compared to the first floor. The majority of the east and western portions are covered with storage tanks for oil. At the time of the match most of these containers are approximately ¼ full. The machinery and pipes on the ceiling are part of the mechanism that distributes oil into the storage tanks, along with water filtration and air conditioning. In the middle of the area is a helipad with a currently out of order helicopter capable of holding six passengers and a pilot. The catwalk on this level mirrors the one below, and is significantly more degraded.

**Goal:** RETIRE your opponents!

**Additional Information:** A number of workers are stationed around the oil rig performing various maintenance tasks. All workers have 2/2/2 physicals and Jojo NPC 2 (causing them to generally ignore bizarre phenomena happening around them).

[The Sunset Tree] is positioned on the second floor, a few meters west of the helipad. While its slowing effect normally would not extend down underneath the tree’s location, here the roots of the tree have grown through the floor of the oil rig, and are in turn extending the slowing aura to the first floor, albeit at half of its usual Pow. The Wolves will generally aim to chew on various objects in the area in regards to their passive property damage efforts, prioritizing items softer than metal unless made unavailable or dangerous to access.

[Silver Mountain Man]’s starting greatsword is made of concrete, and its starting shield is made of steel.

About 6 months ago I asked out a regular (man, ~40) from my work out for coffee and he didn’t overtly reject me. He just ended up saying, yes, he was single and asking my age (31f) and seemingly being pleasantly surprised about being closer to his age (I look hella young and still carded/pegged for a teen, and forget this fact constantly). We got interrupted however by my coworker and never got to finish the conversation. He’s never brought it up, but I have just to apologize briefly in case I made him feel on the spot or uncomfortable because after a while I assumed it was a rejection, and he told me it’s fine and not a big deal. 

We however, do still flirt occasionally. Nothing sexual, just some light gentle teasing and witty banter. It’s just starting to get painful since I’m still attracted to him and he’s fun to talk to. Nothing is happening on his end though, and I’m really over it. I will note that he’s not being malicious (to my knowledge) and has nothing but outwardly kind to me. Its just been a fun pastime for a little while. 

I’m less looking for reasons to carry to torch of hope and just wanting advice on how to get over this… crush?  I’m so use to people being absolute jackasses over rejections/breakups that I actually have no coping skills for this. Lol


TLDR: I asked out a guy from my work who didn’t overtly reject me, and we still flirt to this day. I’m over the lack of initiative however, and want to snuff out my crush and have no coping skills for someone treating me like a person after a presumed or implied rejection with the timeline.

Hello!

Background: We are starting a restoration on our house due to a smoke damage from a small fire in the garage. The house has a main level and a full basement below. The basement below is finished but there will be some drywall removed to seal for the smoke. Our contractor mentioned they could likely remove the wall that separates the kitchen from the living dining and we love the idea. The windows in the corner of the kitchen bring in alot of light, and we cook and entertain a ton, and love the idea of opening up the kitchen. It's sent us down a rabbit hole to figure out the best kitchen layout as a starting point for a conversation with the contractor. We would love your feedback on the layout so far!

Goals: Optimize kitchen layout for cooking/entertaining. Create space for a pantry and a coffee bar.

Questions/Concerns: We think the current proposed layout is way better than existing but it still seems far from perfect. DW on left side of sink doesn't seem great. We don't think we'll be able to relocate sink but that might be up for discussion. Range/Sink/Fridge layout doesn't seem ideal currently. Struggling to make space for both a pantry & a coffee bar. We've read that 4' corridor width between island & countertop is ideal, but the it looks out of proportion (too big) on the plan.

Thanks for looking! looking forward to hear your thoughts and seeing how we can improve the layout. Open to appliance relocations or even wholesale changes to the layout if you see something we're missing. Cheers!",1,1758415198.0,kitchenremodel,0,1.0,False

She would spend doing so for several hours and have loud phone calls on speaker. She keeps inviting over her friends quite often, she doesn't have to get permission but as we all pay rent for the same house but we split the utilities, we would appreciate her to give us a heads-up beforehand and we don't want our bills to go up because of her friends.

By trade I'm a pilot. Many ratings and thousands of hours in dozens of planes. Most recently I was in management and trained pilots. I've recently decided to go back to flying. I also have a white collar professional side-gig that I do. (Not uber eats or uber lol!!!)

I’m a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is. Honestly, you could grab a coffee with her and she’d probably give me a decent Yelp review. Joking lol (we are divorced for reason haha)

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole “personal growth” thing. No baggage, no “crazy ex” stories—just came out the other side in a solid spot.

I’m looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that’s fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I’m easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree).

I’ve traveled a lot (military brat perks), five continents and counting. Would love someone who’s adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.

I’m an extroverted introvert; social, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I’ve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn’t my jam; so Texas ladies, you’ve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **49ers vs. Cardinals: A Tale of Two QBs and One Very Confused Spread Line**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: A Spreadsheet Lover’s Wet Dream**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even Kyler Murray can’t outrun math. The San Francisco 49ers are favored by 2.5 points across most books, with decimal odds hovering around **1.75-1.77** (implied probability: **57-58%**). The Arizona Cardinals, meanwhile, sit at **2.10-2.15** (implied **47-48%**). Translation: Bookmakers think the 49ers are slightly more likely to win a game than you’re likely to finish your Monday morning Zoom call without spilling coffee.

The over/under? **44.5-45.5 points**, with even money lines. Given both teams have injury-riddled rosters, this isn’t a “points fest”—think of it as two chefs arguing over the last slice of pizza: lots of posturing, minimal calories consumed.

**Key stat**: The 49ers’ defense is allowing just **25% run efficiency**, per Jose Sanchez’s glowing report. That’s like building a fortress around your Wi-Fi router and telling Kyler Murray, “Come get it if you dare.”

---

**2. Digest the News: Mac vs. Kyler, Injuries Galore**  
The 49ers are missing their star QB, Brock Purdy, who’s “highly unlikely” to play. Enter **Mac Jones**, the NFL’s version of a beta tester. Jones, bless his heart, has “better velocity on his throws,” per Sanchez. Let’s hope that means he can finally throw a spiral without a physics degree. The 49ers’ offense? A patchwork of hope, prayer, and Jimmy G’s old highlight reels.

On the other side, Kyler Murray is Arizona’s golden boy—a dual-threat QB who makes Tom Brady look like a stationary target. But here’s the rub: The 49ers’ defense *specifically fears* Murray’s legs and arms in equal measure. Per Sanchez, “He gives us headaches.” Translation: Murray is a two-headed monster: one head yells “Run for your life!”; the other yells “Throw it 70 yards!”

Both teams are nursing injuries like a toddler with a broken toy. Arizona’s offensive line? A Jenga tower after a earthquake. San Franc

 Well, after a bit we were able to buy a really well taken care of BBE from marketplace for $200. (I was saving for a Miicoffee Apex ii, but I couldnt pass up the price.) So now were making much higher quality espresso and Im having fun dialing in and playing with tools. I even made a little bit of latte art with almond milk!  (Althought Im still learning all the ins and outs, epsecially trying to learn the tastes. I think it will just take some time. Any suggestions would be appriciated.)


Im making do with the built in grinder for now. A good grinder just isnt yet in the budget. (Maybe for Christmas)

1nme2p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1nme2p6/a_moment_to_myself/,A Moment to Myself,"I wake before the house remembers its name. Coffee on my breath. Small me negotiating the dark, the quiet hymn of a washing machine & a child's laugh that pockets my tired like a lucky coin.

My hands know how to hold half a world: one child’s fevered forehead, one dream folded thin. 

A husband gone before the sun learns to care, papers that say ""maybe"" and a refrigerator that says ""soon.""

there's a tiny ceremony to each day. Cooking, singing, sneaking spinach into mac and cheese. The ritual of making safety out of ordinary things.

I tuck courage into lunchboxes and braid hope into hair.

Sometimes anger sits like an uninvited guest. Sharp and honest. Accusing the sky for small betrayals. Sometimes grief arrives wearing last year's shoes, and I let it through the door, set a cup beside it, and talk.

But then. A smile. Sudden and crooked. A tiny miracle, and everything rearranges like furniture after a storm. A snack shared between fingers, a drawing taped to the wall, and I remember: I am not only what breaks; I am what rebuilds.

A tiny hint of a seeded memory. Rooted in darkness watered by light. Blooming into strength and wisdom. Graced with beauty and compassion; astonishing even the daisies into stares.

I am learning to be gentle with my own shadow. To tend to the small lights that live behind my ribs.

I map out futures in the margins of bills. I write prayers in grocery lists, and believe in stubborn things. If you ask what I want, it's just this: steady days and dreams come true.

A neighbor who brings casserole without questions, enough quiet to finish a sentence, enough money to breathe. And for my children to know how loudly they are loved.

Tonight, I fold laundry like they’re origami promises; whispering to the fabric: 

""We are here, we will keep going.""

The moon slips through the curtains like a benediction. In that moment, between the ordinary and the holy,

I breathe.

And that breath remembers how to hope.",1,1758414537.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

This isn’t a Gugelhupf as we previously discussed- that is a yeasted cake.  But the recipe had chocolate so I went for it anyways.  A very strange recipe.  I did make one substitution based on other’s comments; since we weren’t big on rum I used a coffee liqueur instead.  I think it was a good choice - you can’t really taste it although there is a slight alcohol background note.

I don’t think I have made a marble cake since the ‘90s, and my Bundt pan was covered in dust in my basement.  To coat the pan, I made a cheater’s “cake goop”; I had a little bit of butter left in a wrapper after measuring the butter out for the recipe (1 - 1/2 tsp.), so I sprinkled some flour on top and smushed it around and then spread that in.  Since my pan is old school (‘80s) it doesn’t have any sharp corners; I also temped the cake and pulled it at 210F to be sure it was fully baked.

The recipe is strange - you work so hard to get the air in, and then in the chocolate part all the air gets knocked out when you add chocolate, cocoa and alcohol.  I don’t think it was worth the effort and the full sink of dishes required.  I liked the basic chocolate cake we did months ago better!

After what seemed like eons, he saw light beckoning him, and he slogged his way towards the light. There was light mood music playing, and he was blinded by the bright blue light caressing the room.

It had shag carpet this room, and old-style record players crooning out music from long dead artists. Dozens of bean bags and lounge chairs crowded the room, a thick haze hiding their users. There was some coughing and the clattering of glass hitting the ground and quickly being picked back up.

Travis saw clawed, gnarled hands gripping the bongs and pipes.

He thought the people in the chairs had the heads of beasts for a second; but as his eyes adjusted to the drug fueled haze, he saw that they were in fact wolves.

Beast men chilling out and zoning out.

None acknowledged his presence. They simply existed.

Travis walked briskly through the room, the soft crunch of shag under his feet. He saw an empty chair with a massive bong next to it.

He thought back to his time in college. There was a time when he would partake in something like that, waste his time and energy getting high. Sure; he was high now, but this had purpose. The time spent lighting up in his dorm had been a disgusting waste.

He recalled how he flunked a final because he was so burnt out from smoking with his buddies the night before. Max had been in town and had egged him on, all while leaning on his then roommate Charles.

One look from her and that was all it took to spend the night zoning out in front of the TV, eyes redder than mars. He shook that thought off and trudged through the room.

Another door lay at the end, another path leading deeper into Remus. 

Once more Travis traversed though the stair maze, the wall his best friend. He soon found another room, one of a violet hue. It seemed just as endless as upstairs but sported a different decadent theme.

Rows upon rows of bedding were on display, separated by glass walls. Men and women alike writhed around on the beds, being pleasured by hideous creatures.

Beasts and demons indulged on their own desires, their human partners gladly giving it up to them. Every pair was watched behind the glass by someone.

They seemed eager to watch yet jealous all the same. Some pleasured themselves in a vain attempt to gain control of the situation, yet at the end of the day their loved one was getting backshots from a werewolf.

All they could do was watch on in envy,

Travis averted his gaze as best he could, trying to ignore the ravenous moans around him. He was more embarrassed than anything.

He recalled the time he came home early from work, only to find Max and Brad on the couch. He had attempted to leave but Max saw him and beckoned him closer. To watch Brad's pathetic attempt at fucking but not intervene.

Travis had watched Brad wriggle on top of her while Max looked him in the eyes, her baby blues wishing it was him. Her fake moans and lying cries excited Brad but made Travis feel pathetic.

He brushed that memory off, disgust flooding his thoughts.

He finally escaped the room after miles of cuckoldry. Another room awaited him of course, one that had a green hue to it.

This room was different. It had beast men running around in suits and ties, yelling at each other in gruff voices. Some of them sat at desks, actually taking calls. One wearing glasses sat at his desk and used his furry paws to shove large piles of money into a sack.

The wolf men accountants barked at each other, rabid and green at the gills at the prospect of more profit. It looked more like an office then any office Travis had ever worked at, granted that wasn't many.

Travis eyed the wolf laundering money into the sack and thought back to his childhood.

Growing up in the South; he was used to being dragged to church every Sunday morning at the crack of dawn, and sometimes the whip. He was too young to appreciate it, to understand why he went.

So he rebelled against it.

One day when the collection plate came around, and he thought no one was looking, he plucked his grubby little hand into the plate and stole a wad of bills. Needless to say, he was caught, and the whopping he received from his father was so legendary they still talk about it in Georgia to this day.

It was that vicious little sin that first attracted Max to him. Like a fly to shit.

He felt a tap on the shoulder as he was still lost in thought. He turned to see a stern faced wolfman.

 ""Excuse me sir I don't think you should be here."" Travis was either too stunned to speak or too high. He couldn't decide which. The wolfman stood there, hands on hips, tapping his clawed foot. The others ignored them, but their ears perked slightly at the drama.

""I say again sir, I need you to leave this is a restricted area."" The wolf impatiently cried.

 ""Is-isn't this Remus?"" Travis slurred. The creature rolled its beastly yellow eyes. 

""You took a wrong turn somewhere kid; this is the accounting dept for Mr. Havenwood's various endeavors."" He explained. He clasped a furry paw on his shoulder and pointed towards the door. ""I can't be too mad; it happens more than you think.""

""I-I'm sorry I just want to find Max and Brad and-and."" Travis ranted in his drug induced state. The wolfman comforted him, mostly out of pity. He escorted Travis to the door and showed him the exit. 

""Down this way, keep going straight you'll know when you reach the next floor. You'll probably smell it before ya see it."" he grimaced. He gently pushed Travis towards the door, and he continued his journey. 

The wolf accountant was right. There was a foul stench that assaulted Travis halfway down the darkened corridor.  It reeked of rancid flesh and gore left out in the sun. It made Travis retch, but nothing came up.

He came to an entrance way filled with an orange hue. He was met with an impossible sight.

An endless field of meat and viscera. Vultures circled overheard, an orange haze of death coating the field and sky. Travis could hear the sounds of munching and the cracking of bones. He looked around him and saw feral wolfmen.

Lanky and mange filled, they stuffed their greedy maws with flesh and God knows what else. Their eyes were pure, milky white contrasted against black, matted fur. They were huddled in groups, some as large as five around various piles.

They hunched over hungerly, gladly tearing into the mass of meat. There was an obvious pathway to the next doorway, so Travis quickly wadded through a pool of viscera. He could feel the crunch and squish of bone snapping and flesh stomping under his heel.

This time he prayed for a memory, to distract himself from the horror.

As luck would have it, he did seem to recall the time he had invited Max to thanksgiving.

It had been a year ago, Max and Bard had gotten into another fight and Travis was invited over to- well, he was invited simply out of spite.

Max kept filling his plate with food, saying how much she had slaved away at cooking all day and she would feed whoever she wanted.

Travis got five plates full of greens, stuffing, juicy turkey, and pumpkin pie.

Brad got nothing.

And seethed about it yet didn't left a finger to defend himself. Neither did Travis to come to his defense, put a stop to the petty indulgence.

He just sat there enjoying a free meal. Travis heard a voice call out to him. One of the feral things was waving a decayed arm at him. 

""Come young pup, feast with us."" It called out to him. The others rang out in a chorus, ""Come to us brother, feast, fill your belly.""  They cried out in joy and unabated glutton. Travis quickened his pace as he felt a large thud.

He stopped in his tracks and a few feet from him, the pile of ferals scattered as the maw of a massive Doberman clamped down on the pile. Travis saw the creature, with its solid scarlet eye barely acknowledge him.

It chewed the pile and slowly lifted its head, gore spilling from its maw. The head was impossibly large, and its neck extended for what seemed like miles. The body of it was that of a massive, muscular dog. As the neck stretched back slowly, Travis could make out two other heads in the distancing, chomping at their own perspective piles.

It lifted one paw and thudded closer to him, causing Travis to panic and sprint to the exit. He jumped through the doorway in abject terror, tumbling down another fleet of stairs.

He blacked out and found himself at the bottom of another floor. 

This room was familiar; this room was home.

Travis blinked and he could see daylight hitting the wooden floor. The hardwood even had that scuff from the time he had drunkenly came home and started to kick the floor.

Why had he done that anyway? He recalled some petty argument with Brad. Something to do with Max, he was sure. A dark pit formed in his stomach, as his mind dwelt on his roommate.

Max had asked him to house the soon-to-be-homeless Brad. Something had happened with the landlord of his old place, something she had been involved with, Travis was sure of it.

He never said anything, could never say no to Max. The way she spoke, the way she knew to play every chord and button on his heart. He was wrapped around her finger tighter than a wedding ring on a fat man.

Since the spinless twerp had moved in, it had been problem after problem, fight after blowout. Travis could barely look at the pathetic worm sometimes.

That's what he was wasn't he? The way he let Max stomp all over his manhood, the way she would cackle at every little insecurity of his behind his back. Travis stomped around his house, a fire in his heart and called out for Max.

Instead, he found Brad.

He was sitting stone faced on the green pull out. Travis had always hated that couch. His cloths were frazzled and his shaggy hair tussled and frayed. His eyes were lifeless.

He was just sitting there, staring blankly into space. He didn't even seem to register Travis at first. He didn't see the disgusted look on his face.

""Brad. Where is Max."" Travis said, trying to calm himself. He took a deep breath and asked again. The second time seemed to snap him out of his stupor, and he looked at Travis. His face began to contort in a disgusting show of emotion. His face scrunched up and his eyes filled with tears as he began to weep. 

""Travis, oh Jesus, oh god you're here, you're really here."" He collapsed to the floor, a pile of gutless excrement.  Travis just looked at him, a dark expression looming on him. ""You don't- my god the things I saw, it's impossible, impossible but they were real, they-they did things. "" Brad looked up, his eyes wide in abject horror. 

""Where is Max."" Travis repeated. 

""She-she left me here, in this godforsaken pit. She was always, always mean but I can't believe she left me here, to rot."" Brad blubbered, tears streaking down his face. 

""You shouldn't say that about my home."" Travis remarked.

""Wh-what are you talking about, look around you Travis, It's a disgusting, dank pit."" Brad screeched at him. Travis glanced around the room.

He saw crimson curtains bathed in sunlight. The peach red walls he had painted himself. The walls were covered in family photos, Travis' degree in engineering.  Near a window sat a vase with roses in them.

They smelled delightful.

Travis glanced back at Brad. That dark pit had formed into nauseating hatred he could no longer ignore. 

""You ungrateful little shit."" He muttered. Brad started to sputter a reply and was met with a swift kick to the face. Brad fell to the ground with a *thud*. Travis advanced towards him, reaching down and throwing the oak coffee table that sat in front of the pull out across the room. He raised his foot and kicked Brad in the ribs, again and again.

Each hit connected with a satisfying *whump*, all to the tune of his whimpering. Brad was curling, trying to stave off the assault in a pathetic display of submission. Travis reached down and pulled him up, only to toss him back down on his back.

His head bounced off the hardwood like a melon. Travis pounced on him, a ravenous sensation overwhelming him. He pinned him, knees digging into Brad's wheezing chest. Blood sprinkled lightly around his mouth, his eyes pleading with Travis.

Travis ignored them.

He raised his fists and brought them down against Brad's face with the force of years of repressed fury. He slammed into his mouth, blood splattering the floor with every blow. Travis huffed and puffed, his rage fueling him.

After a certain point he began clawing away at Brad's face. He could feel his fingernails force their way into Brad's skin, tearing away with every slash. Brad tried to scream out but all that came out was a gurgle, and he spurted a thick, mucus amount of blood onto Travis' face.

He smeared it across himself, blinded by his rage. He got off him and Brad turned his back to him, a vain attempt to crawl away. He could talk now, no longer simply choking on the fluid rushing into his lungs. He coughed it up all over the floor, infuriating Travis even further.

He rushed over, grabbing a fistful of Brad's shaggy blonde hair. He began dragging him across the floor effortlessly, like a mop dragging drain water. 

""Please, why please, why are you doing this Travis. This isn-"" Brad was cut off by the sudden slam into the floor Travis provided. He resumed dragging, bringing his face right against the peach red wall. Brad's eyes were bloodshot and weary from pain. Travis looked more determined than ever. 

""This is me."" he said calmly, as he began to repeatedly and rhythmically bash Brad's face into the wall. It was a slow, methodical thud at first, but it gained rapid pace. It was like he was playing the drums.

1-2-*slam*

1-2-*slam*

1-2-*SLAM.*

Brad cried out at first, but slowly and surely those cries faded, and were replaced by silence. All that remained was that rhematic thudding. A face shaped stain appeared against the spider-cracked wall Brad was being slammed into it.

It grew in size each time.

It grew redder each time, stickier.

Eventually a crunching sound appeared, bone being forcibly torn apart, smashed to bits. Travis sat there, his hand cramping and bits of bone beginning to splinter and cut into him. His rage lessened with each slam. His breathing calmed and he could see past the haze of hate.

He slammed what was left of Brad's head into the wall one final time, and it stuck there like a fly on a glue trap. He leaned himself against the wall, his hands cut and bloody.

They were shaking, he looked at his them and couldn't help but tremble along. Past his hands he could just barely see their work.

His legs stopped working the more he looked at it, collapsing under the weight. His eyes stung, and he held back the fear and disgust as best he could. Finally, he looked past his hands and could not bear it any longer.

He let out a primal scream, and kept screaming until his lungs were ripe and his throat horse. Bitter tears of disappointment flooded his face as looked at brad. He was slumped over in a 90-degree angle, his face still stuck to the wall. Travis looked away and put his head in his hands. 

""Why, why did you make me do this."" He muttered to himself.

Brad did not reply.

""All you had to do was say no, to fight back, stand up for yourself."" He cried out to a hollow room. ""But you couldn't do it could you, God even now I, it doesn't justify it, but I still hate you. How weak you were. How you let Her walk all over you. You chose this, just like I did. It was always going to end this way wasn't it.""

Brad did not reply.

Travis took his head from his hands and looked at the corpse. With a grimace, he reached over and tried to pry the head from the wall. It was dead stuck; the rigor-mortise had set in fast. With a grunt he tore off the head, bits and pieces clung to the wall like bloody string cheese.

He retched slightly and brought the body to the floor. He looked around, for any sort of blanket or anything. He saw one on the couch and quietly retrieved it. Covering the body as best he could, Travis slumped back against the wall. Out the corner of his eye, he saw his silver cross tat.

It was splattered with dried blood. A new wave of disgust washed over him. 

""Oh Christ, lord please, please forgive me, I-oh god."" Back into his hands his head went. ""Father, thou art in heaven-"" he began to pray. In his heart, he knew it was hollow.

How long had it been since he prayed?

Since he believed.

There was a time yes, but the years had slowly chipped it away, broken down by life- broken down by her.

She had always mocked his faith, his genuine heart. It almost drove them apart in their teenage years, but his lust and pride brought him back to her, like she always knew it would. Her vanity wouldn't allow someone to worship any idol but her, and soon she began to infect every aspect of his life.

At the end of it all, he still chose to didn't he?

He let himself be led astray, down this fallen path. Now look where he was.

So, he sat there; reciting a crocodile's prayer, to someone he still hoped was there.

""He is not listening."" A voice croaked. Travis looked up startled. It was one of the jackal beasts he had seen guarding the gates of Remus. He looked at Travis with pity, and a mournful sense of empathy. ""He never was. For he is the great deceiver."" 

""I don't understand."" Travis muttered.

 ""You will soon enough, young pup."" The Jackal said in a grave voice. ""Oleg has one final test for you below. A true test of faith."" Travis scoffed.

""Faith in what."" He spat.

""In yourself."" Jackal replied. He pointed his staff towards an exit at the back of the room. Travis could hear faint music and moaning coming from it. He slowly got up, eyeing the door.

He was on autopilot now, walking towards his fate like a puppet on a string. The doorway led down, just like all the rest. The music and moans grew louder as he descended. A pinkish hue emitted from the entrance, the scent of musk and lust clung to the air.

When Travis looked into the room, he was met with a massive orgy. Bodies upon bodies, all entangled together like a giant tumor. Wet, plappping sounds filled the air as a light melody failed to drone out the grotesque display.

The ground felt sticky and moist to the touch. Travis was careful to not disturb the various lovers, tiptoeing across the field of nudity like they were shards of glass. They didn't seem to care one way or the other.

Some of the nude things were not human, they were beasts. Wolves clawing at frail human backs, serpent women straddling each other.  Travis felt flushed at this orgy of the damned. In the center of the room was the largest pile, a wriggling mass of carnal appetites.

In the center was a woman, if one could call her that. She was eight feet tall and completely nude. Her long flowing hair was a mess of brown leathery locks; each strand seemed to move independently of each other.

The woman had violet eyes, almost cat-like their iris. They glowed in the dark, Travis could make out the primal pleasure in them. She had scaly arms, leading into horrific yet gentle claws. He watched as they explored every inch of her partners. The woman's body was lightly furred, a she-beast if there ever was one. He could make out a cat like tail with a forked end.

From across the decadent room, she saw him. Her expression lighting up with glee. She pounced over to him, galloping over on all fours.  As she drew closer, Travis noticed her body was covered in tattoos, various Gothic items and black crosses.

She made a purring sound as she curled up to his legs, like she was a cat in heat. Her head brushed past his hands, and he recoiled on instinct. Maxine then stood up, dwarfing the 6,2 Travis. She eyed him like a slab of meat.

""Travis, you made it. I knew you would baby."" She purred. 

""Max, what happened to you."" Travis said, eyeing her fur covered hind legs and hooved feet.

""I'm just the same as I've always been, I can just be more honest now."" Max moaned. Behind her, the pile called out to her like a dying whale. Max leaned down and put her arms around Travis, her pointed fingers softly scratching his back. Travis felt goosebumps crawl down his spine.

""Brad isn't. . .I killed him. I'm so sorry Max."" Travis proclaimed. She excepted some kind of reaction from her, for her to cry and slash him to bits. He would deserve it after all.

Instead, she leaned in, biting her lip.

""I Know. I couldn't be prouder; killer."" she sultry said, nipping at his ear. She went back to meet his gaze, giggling to herself.  She swayed her hips eager to entice him.

""I never really liked him anyway, I just knew it riled you up, wanting what you couldn't have."" She slipped out a long, black tongue. She licked her lips, then reached over with it and slowly licked Travis' face from top to bottom.

It felt like a slimy piece of sandpaper on his face. ""You can have me now baby, I know you want to."" She purred. Travis was motionless, his knees wobbly. 

""No-no I don't want this. I don't want you."" he said, starting to push her away. Max caught herself and leaned her body in closer, burying Travis' head in her breasts.

""Shhhhh yes you do. You always do, because I want you. You can't deny me Travis."" She cooed in his ear, straddling his inner thigh. Travis pushed once more, looking the she-beast did in her eyes.

""You don't get it do you, you're still clinging to this. We made each other worse Max. "" Travis pleaded. Max's eyes filled with desire, and she started towards him once more. Travis reached out his hands and pushed her back.

She fell to the floor, a shocked look on her face. Her former pile crawled over to her, trying to sooth her wounds and bring her back into the fold. She clawed them away and they shrunk back. 

""Fucking sycophants. They can't give me what I want, what I crave."" She moaned. "" I need you Travis, I need you to fuck me, forever and ever."" She taunted, extending a 'come hither"" finger wave.

""No. I was never your friend, or even your lover. I was a goddamn simp.""  Travis spat. ""And I'm done with you."" With that, he turned his back on Max the she-beast. She reached out for him, calling out his name, pleading with him as the pile of her own making dragged her back in.

Her cries were drowned out in a crescendo of fellatio and orgasms, as Travis made his way to the final exit. 

The final door was tall, stretching out to the ceiling for what seemed like an eternity. It was unguarded, but He could hear faint chanting from inside. A red glow shot out, in the form of a cross. It reached out to him, inviting him in. Travis was blinded by the light at first, but as his eyes adjusted, he made his way in.

It was a long hall, flanked on all sides by men in occult brandished robes. Their hoods were drawn, their heads down, yet Travis knew they were wolves. He would expect nothing less at this point.

At the end of the room, he could make out a massive crucifix. Its crimson glow filled the room. A figure stood at the base of it. His arms outstretched. He beckoned Travis closer. As approached, his knees buckled out from under him; and he crawled the rest of the way, in awe of the glorious sight in front of him.

When he got to the altar, he sat there on his knees, hands cupped and covered in dried blood. He wanted to call out and pray for salvation. But in his soul, he knew he was dammed.

The figure stepped out and revealed himself to be Oleg Havenwood. He was fully nude, not a care in the world. He wore a proud face, and his eyes beamed with respect.

""My Son. In my heart, I knew you would prevail. That the wolf would prosper among the sheep."" Oleg preached. Travis remained quiet. Oleg approached him, arms readying for an embrace. ""You have beaten your carnal sins; your sloth, your lust- you have risen to lead, to become more.""

""But I failed."" Travis said. This stopped Oleg in his tracks.  ""I slaughtered an innocent man. I gave into my rage and butchered him like a dog."" Oleg smirked at this.

""Do not mourn the weak, it is their duty to uplift the strong."" He offered a hand to help Travis up. Travis took it meekly. 

""What about Max."" he countered, getting up to meet the naked man.

""She made her choice; she'll spend the rest of her days rutting with beasts and devils. Fitting I suppose, after all; Demons are a girl's best friend."" Oleg Cracked.

Travis then snapped, breaking into a low chuckle, followed by uncontrollable laughter. His fit caused him to collapse on the altar, Oleg joining him and slapping him on the back. 

""What is this place, why did I do all this, what was the point."" Travis began to beg, pleading for the point to be spelled out for him. 

""When you first came here, I asked you what that cross means to you. You lied."" Oleg deflected. 

""Because it hasn't meant anything to me for a long time."" Travis admitted.

""Would you like it to?"" Oleg pushed. Travis eyed the naked bald man in front of him. ""You feel nothing for this not because you lost your faith, but because you put your faith in the wrong person. The deceiver."" Oleg spat. He pointed up to the giant neon cross.

It had something strapped to it. A body had been strung up in a faux crucifixion. It looked like a man, a mutilated man but a man, nonetheless.

The body's arms were outstretched, a green Muppet tattoo on one arm. Where its head would be was the massive head of a silver wolf. Blood flowed from the maw of the stuffed head, its piercing black eyes staring down at the gentlemen.

""The True god has gone by many names, Varcolac, Fenrir, Morrighan, but always it has remained in the purest of forms."" Oleg preached. Travis stared in awe as he continued. ""We were the dominant ones, it was a utopia. Until the deceiver came. His followers came and punished us for our belief, hunted us like wild animals, drove us into the dark. They darkened the truth, burned all they deemed heretics.""

Oleg's eyes softened as he spoke, like he was remembering it all personally. ""But we kept the faith, and our savior granted us his only son, and when he came, he came in the guise of a man yes, but his true form-remained pure. Of course they hated him, the Deceivers' followers. He was betrayed and hung up to die like our effigy."" He waved his hand at the cross. Travis digested this information, his eyes widening.

 ""Do you mean to tell me that J-"" He began but was quickly cut off by a frothing at the mouth Oleg.

""That is exactly what I am saying, they took that from us, the humans, the mortals."" He said with disdain. ""They made a mockery of our savior and parade his corpse around their necks."" Travis looked down at the cross on his arm. 

""I. . . I didn't know, how could I."" Travis pleaded. ""We have to tell people, what I've seen is the truth, it has to be."" He rationalized. Oleg smiled simply.

""The prophets have been spreading the word in their gospels all along. How many have listened, really listened."" Oleg replied coyly.

 ""What can we do then, what can I do?"" Travis begged.

""So, you believe then. You willingly choose to lead this cause? That's what the new world needs Travis. It needs leaders. Join me, and you will have every need fulfilled, the one God will embrace you as his own.""

""Join me and ascend beyond mortal hood. Learn my ways, and preach the words of power, and you will know true peace."" Oleg lied. Travis remained on his knees, staring up at the supposed prophet. He looked down, mind shattered beyond belief. He met Oleg's gaze once more and simply uttered.

""Teach me."" Oleg broke out in a devilish grin, stepping back from Travis. His head started to convulse, his body twitching and contorting. His limbs stretched out, growing thicker with silver fur protruding out of every orifice.

He hunched over, his spine poking out as he let out a grunt of pain. His mouth elongated, a massive maw chomping at the bits. He grew several feet, a hulking wolf of 15 feet. His eyes were black as the void of space, ears protruding out of his head.

Drool dripped onto the altar in buckets, his teeth sharp enough to split him in half in one bite. Oleg stood up, reveling his massive stature. The fur around his face looked like a great silver beard, a king among his pack.

He outreached one claw above Travis. He took his free hand and carefully cut open the palm of his hand, reveling a thick dark fluid that flowed from the wound. 

""This is my blood, drink of it and think of me."" The giant crooned. The blood felt warm to the touch, as it dripped over Travis like rain. He opened his mouth and lapped up the droplets.

They burned going down, like poison being forced upon him. He gagged through the pain and swallowed every last drop that came to him.

In the end he was drenched in the blood of the wolf. It grunted and reached behind him. It grabbed the strung-up effigy and tossed it at Travis' feet. ""This is my body. Eat of it and become me."" The thing preached once more.

Travis dove into the corpse without hesitation, he grabbed the corpse's arm and bit into it like a wild animal. He tore and gulped down every bit of flesh he could, he relished it. As the meat slide down his gullet, he felt the change coming.

His body ached; it contorted and pulled at self. Thick black fur covered his arms; his cloths tore as his deformed body grew into his new form. As he tore at the effigy, he started to growl and pant. Before he knew it his hands were claws, greedily digging into a dead man's entrails. He stopped, his mighty jaw spilling with meat. He stood up, reveling his enhanced stature.

He looked around him, the hooded wolves bowing before him. He was reborn, a new god his master. He turned his head to the sky and howled, his howls echoing in the hallowed halls of the wolf god.

His cries were met with a chorus of wolfmen, all mad, all broken, all deceived by the true deceiver, Oleg The Cruel. ",1,1758413565.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I kept messing up drinks, falling behind, and my shift had to pull me off bar because I couldn’t keep up.

I really want to get better. I like the job and the people but I feel so defeated. I’m starting to wonder if this job is even right for me because I cannot memorize drink orders to save my life.
Does anyone have tips for how to get faster and more confident on bar? Or at least how to not cry when you feel like you’re drowning?

1nmdkot,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nmdkot/which_planner_2026_works_best_for_small_desks/,Which planner 2026 works best for small desks?,"Hey there! I wanted to share my experience finding the perfect planner for my tiny desk setup. Like many of you, I've been working with limited space, and finding a planner that doesn't take up half my workspace has been quite a journey.

After trying countless options, I finally found a fantastic planner 2026 that's both compact and functional. I spend hours at my desk daily, and having an organized schedule is crucial for my productivity. The key was finding something that could fit alongside my laptop, coffee mug, and other essentials without creating clutter.

What really worked for me was this sleek, minimalist planner I found here: https://athometouch.com/planner-2026. It's perfectly sized for small desks while still offering enough writing space for daily tasks, appointments, and goals. The pages are thick enough to prevent ink bleeding, which was a huge issue with my previous planners.

Here's what I love about this particular planner:
- Compact size (fits in a 12x8 inch space)
- Lay-flat binding (crucial for small spaces)
- Monthly and weekly spreads
- Goal-setting sections
- Note pages that don't bulk up the planner

I've noticed that many desk planners are unnecessarily large, making them impractical for smaller workspaces. The one I'm using now has clever features like tear-out lists and a built-in bookmark, which helps maximize functionality without adding bulk.

For those still searching for the perfect small-desk planner, you can check out the details and dimensions here: https://athometouch.com/planner-2026. It's been a game-changer for my daily planning and desk organization.

One tip I've learned is to look for planners with a vertical weekly layout rather than horizontal - they typically take up less desk space while providing the same amount of planning area. Also, consider planners with removable sections, so you can adjust the thickness based on your needs.

The best part? This planner actually helps me stay more organized because I'm not constantly moving it around to make space for other things. It's become a permanent fixture on my desk without being intrusive.

Remember, the key to making a small desk work isn't just about the planner size - it's about how well it integrates with your existing workspace. I hope this helps anyone else dealing with similar space constraints!",1,1758413059.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

I built this for a project that had about 100 pages that needed the seo tags optimized, and it's since hit me that a lot more people may need this, and with the paid alternatives, it's a lot harder to find a tool that can get the job done, so i had to build mine.

1nmdca3,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1nmdca3/valorants_29th_agent_theories/,Valorant’s 29th Agent Theories?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve gathered all the information and hints Riot has dropped here and there about Valorant’s upcoming 29th agent, and I wanted to share my theories. During the Masters in Toronto, a mysterious silhouette was revealed. Next to it were coordinates that led directly to Dakar, Senegal. This strongly suggests that the next agent will be Senegalese, even if his role remains uncertain for now. He could either be a Controller or a Sentinel. For context, the last Sentinel released was **Vyse** (August 28, 2024), and the last Controller was **Clove** (March 26, 2024).

The silhouette itself is intriguing: the jacket looks a lot like a modern version of the **Senegalese grand boubou**, wide and elegant. It’s also possible Riot included elements of a **kaftan**, another traditional West African garment. This detail seems to firmly anchor the character in his cultural roots.

As always, the Battle Pass included a teaser. This time, the card is called **“Untouchable”**, with the codename **“Morph.”** It shows tribal patterns, turquoise/blue tones, stylized flames… and most importantly, a symbol that resembles both infinity and the number **8**. Could this be him — the long-awaited **Agent 8**? 👀

Riot also added a surprising in-game easter egg: the announcer can now randomly have a new male voice, smooth yet assertive, calling out ACE, CLUTCH, or MATCH POINT. Many believe this is the voice of the upcoming agent. What’s even more interesting is that the same actor voices both the English and the French version — which makes sense, considering French is Senegal’s main language. Fans have pointed out that this voice sounds very similar to **Baptiste from Overwatch**. That points to three possible voice actors: in VO, the Québécois **Benz Antoine**; and in the French version, **Jean-Baptiste Anoumon** or **Thierry Desroses**, whose vocal timbres are very close.

The voice seems to belong to a man in his 30s or 40s. That fits the image of a mature, experienced character, someone who could become a central pillar of the Valorant Protocol. I imagine him as subtle and refined, with a “fine nose” for details — maybe a lover of food or coffee. But socially, he would be the opposite of cold or distant: more like a big “teddy bear,” warm, jovial, welcoming, and very social. I also like the idea of a **family-oriented character**, who would see the Protocol as his second family. On top of that, I picture him as a **storyteller** — not in the lofty sense, but more like a warm raconteur, sharing tales filled with a touch of wonder, myths, and legends.

Nothing is confirmed yet, but the clues are lining up in interesting ways. We’ll probably learn more during the **Champions final in Paris**, where Riot is expected to reveal this agent… alongside the **Harbor rework**.

*(PS: excuse the rough sketch I made — it’s been a long time since I last drew, despite having studied graphic design 😅🙏)*

So, what are your theories? What do you expect from the next agent? What kind of abilities or personality would you like to see?

1nmdb7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/1nmdb7j/finally_got_an_interview_invitation_my_experience/,Finally got an interview invitation - my experience with Resume101,"I’m a civil engineer. My days used to be filled with construction drawings, technical reports, AutoCAD nightmares, and more coffee than any human should consume. I loved making sure projects actually obeyed building codes and catching mistakes before they became expensive disasters.

Then I had kids. What I thought would be a short maternity break stretched into several years. Managing schedules, tantrums, and endless LEGO negotiations became my full-time project — and let me tell you, it wasn’t exactly like coordinating a construction team.

Fast forward to my return. I dusted off my old resume, added some online training, a few freelance projects, reformatted it, and started applying.

# The results?

* 50+ applications
* 0 replies
* 0 interviews

It felt like my resume disappeared into a black hole. Was it the career gap? My gender? Or just bad luck? I started doubting myself: could I handle deadlines, technical accuracy, and the pressure of project sites again? Rationally, yes — but apparently, HR bots disagreed.

# Trying something new

A former colleague suggested I try a professional resume service called Resume101. Honestly, I laughed. Paying someone to rewrite your resume? Seemed like overkill. But after months of zero responses, I figured it was worth a shot.

The process was simple: upload your resume, answer some questions about your achievements and career goals, and get paired with a writer. The surprising part was that the writer actually asked me about specific project outcomes: where I had prevented costly errors, how many people I coordinated during documentation phases, and other measurable results. Stuff I had never considered putting on a resume because I thought it was “just part of the job.”

# The resume glow-up

Three days later, I got the draft back.

Before:

* Prepared technical documentation
* Worked with contractors
* Outdated formatting straight out of early Windows

After Resume101:

* Produced and reviewed construction drawings, technical reports, and specifications for multi-million-dollar infrastructure projects, ensuring compliance with safety codes and reducing rework by 15%
* Coordinated a cross-disciplinary documentation team of six engineers using AutoCAD and Revit, delivering on-time project submissions
* Clean, modern formatting optimized for ATS

It was still my experience, but now framed in a way that highlighted impact rather than just listing tasks.

# What happened next

Within a couple of weeks of sending the updated resume:

* Applications sent: 6
* Replies: 3
* Interviews: 2

The difference was night and day. Resume101 didn’t hand me a job, but it got me noticed — which is half the battle in engineering these days.

# Pros and cons (my take)

**Pros:**

* Fast turnaround: first draft in 3 days
* Real human writer who asks questions instead of rephrasing your old text
* ATS-friendly formatting that actually gets through automated systems
* Affordable compared to big-name agencies

**Cons:**

* They don’t invent achievements — you need to provide real input
* Tone was slightly formal for my taste (I tweaked a few lines)
* Doesn’t replace interview preparation — you still have to perform in person

# Before vs. After

Before: “Prepared documentation, worked with contractors, attended meetings.”  
After: “Reviewed technical reports for safety compliance, coordinated multidisciplinary teams, delivered infrastructure projects on time.”

Notice the difference? One sounds like a generic assistant. The other shows professional impact.

# Final thoughts

I’m not saying everyone needs a service like this. If you’re confident in your resume-writing skills, you might be fine on your own.

But if you’re returning from a long career break, unsure how to frame your experience, and tired of getting ghosted, a service like Resume101 might help. For me, it made the difference between complete silence and getting interviews again.

# Discussion

* Have you tried professional resume writing services? Did it feel worth it?
* Do you think ATS filters are really the problem, or are career gaps more of a hiring bias issue?

I’d love to hear how other engineers or technical writers have handled gaps in their resumes — especially if you’ve returned after years away.",0,1758412302.0,technicalwriting,1,0.2,False

This excerpt includes a character describing a memory of being forced to watch a trapped fox die.

I'm working with psychological realism and I'm overanalyzing this hard. I feel like I've seen monologue/dialogue like this in literary fiction plenty of times, but at the same time I'm doubting it after someone said it sounded odd.

This is a dramatic monologue between the male main character Auger and the female main character Callah. He goes into a dissociative state and tells her about a traumatic event from his childhood where his abusive narcissistic father forced him to sit outside all night and watch a fox die. I've put the parts I was told sound unnatural in bold. I'm trying to decide if I should leave them, turn those into internal stream of consciousness points as he's telling the story, or remove them and turn it completely to plain language.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The feeling comes before he can process it, and his mouth moves of its own accord. Like it knows the words before he does. The feeling of being trapped. Time stretches out in front of him like a tunnel, and all he can do is stare ahead towards the destination. Not forward, but back. Racing in place. He touches his hands to his cheeks and holds them there, opens his mouth and works his jaw. Let's them drop into his lap. Then he turns to look at her, slowly, mechanically, just looks at her. Then back ahead to that destination, numb, and distant.

“You know… there was this fox once. Got itself caught in a snare behind the house. Wire twisted deep into its leg. It was crying, eyes wild, foam on its teeth. I tried to untangle it, but my dad yanked me back. Said let it learn. Told me I was going to stand out there and watch until it died. Said I better not fall asleep and miss it.""

His voice is hollow and distant, simply recounting factual events from what little distance time could afford.

""He brought me a plate of food. Checked on the progress. Mom was inside. Always inside when these lessons happened. She'd peek through the curtains sometimes. Sometimes come putter around the yard, find a reason to get something from the car. But she never said a word. Never even looked at me. Probably stood at the sink washing the same dish over and over that didn't even need to be washed.""

A pause. Brief and fleeting. Hands absentmindedly tracing the fabric of his slacks.

""Barrett was inside somewhere. Probably up in his room. I can't really say because my back was to the house. He always positioned me that way. Like I was in a trench or in a fort and he could come up behind me at any time. Huh. Anyway, Barrett never needed these lessons, but me, well... He said I...we'd see.""

""The fox's cries had started **sharp and desperate, echoing off the trees**. But as hours passed, they'd grown softer, **more resigned**.""

""Sometime late in the night, I heard the screen door slam. Heard him stomping down the wooden stairs, **the grass whispering against his boots as he came. The crunch of leaves turn to dirt** as he walked in front of me, shining a light in my face.""

His jaw tightens, and when he speaks again, there's an edge of his father in his voice. ""'You better not be sleeping!' I squinted against the light but didn’t close my eyes. **Satisfied with whatever he had found in my face,** he turned the light to the fox, sipped his coffee.""

""The fox’s eyes **jittered** against the light and it let out a whimpering pant but it didn’t blink. Just stared off into some **unknown destination past the trees.**""

""I remember having this **metallic** taste in my mouth. Like blood. **Like the air before a storm when its thick with static**. I don't know why, but I did. I could never touch coins after that—or keyrings sometimes—because I smelled it clinging to my hands. No matter how much I washed them. Could taste blood in my mouth.""

""I remember he said 'Here,' and he tossed some batteries at my feet, flipped the flashlight handle towards me. I took it with a shaky hand."" His voice turns sharp and cruel, a perfect imitation of the original's contempt. ""'You can’t see in the dark. You fucking know that. Use your brain, Auger.'""

He pauses and when he speaks his voice is hollow again. ""But how could I have? Going to **retrieve** a flashlight meant I’d left my post. Not seeing meant I'd disobeyed orders. What’s the right choice in the end? I still don’t know. He'd never told me.""

""He’d sipped his coffee again. Grunted with approval. 'Eye on target,' he said, tousling my hair in passing. I remember how loud the screen door shut. Why was it so much louder just that one time? Why was it so quiet the next morning when it shut again? I still don’t know. But my hands shook, the **light bouncing in small arcs.** Shaking from cold. Shaking from fear. **Shaking against my own inertia**.""

He pauses and stares off for a long moment. Waits for the memory to carry him forward.

""I didn’t look away. All night long. Not even to blink. Not in the way that mattered. **I bore witness.** And I can’t really remember when exactly that fox died. Whether it had ever even been alive. **Whether it went sometime in the hollow stillness between those two closed doors.**  I’ve tried so many times to remember when the moment was. When I **kept watching but stopped seeing. When I failed the objective but still passed the task. I**t really bothers me, you know? Not the twitching eyes. Not the grunting. Not the **teeth clattering at the metal in desperation**. It's that I can’t remember that. That I spent so much time doing what I was told to do and I still missed it…”

He trails off for a minute, still trying to find the answer in that memory.

“It was sometime well past dawn. **A cruelty, really**. He woke up at 4:30 every morning, so he was up for a long time before coming to check. It must have about 7am, if I had to guess. My hands frozen and stiff. No longer shaking because they were **cold stone carved around the flashlight**—still on. He came out with his hands on his hips, observing the result. He patted me on the shoulder. Said I did good. Only then did I look at him. Look at his smile. The closest thing to pride he threw to me. Not the authentic one reserved for Barrett.""

""Then the smile disappeared and his face was a stern scowl.  ‘Now clean this shit up.’"" He mimicked it now, **staring far away through his fathers eyes at the small boy shivering in the dew-soaked leaves.** ""'Don’t let that blood dry on there. Treat it so it doesn’t rust. And then get in there and help your mother clean out that garage.'""

""And so I did. And then I **scrubbed my nail beds until they ran red.** Every time they healed, for a long time I would scrub them again just to feel the sting. Just to feel the...""

A long silence. His eyes unfocused, thousand-yard, as if he can still see the blood in the dirt.

“I think about that a lot, you know. In that building… with you… **how I can’t look away while I thrash. How I have to stay until the silence comes.** I did good. That's how you survive. I watch. I endure. It's what I know how to do.”",0,1758412037.0,writers,4,0.5,False

The brand-new romantic comedy from the most famous digital streamer has just premiered and is already a big hit. It stars former Nickelodeon teen star Miranda Cosgrove in her second Netflix original movie (her first original for the streamer was “Mother of the Bride,” another recent success on the platform) and Pierson Fodé (of ""The Perfect Date"").
Synopsis
Dawn (Miranda Cosgrove), a metallurgical artist, lives in rural Texas with her grandmother Bird and her sisters. She dreams of following in her mother's footsteps and becoming a professional artist. A responsible person, Dawn has spent a long time working in a local coffee shop to save up her private fund to study art in Paris. She gets accepted into the university, but without a full scholarship, her savings aren’t enough.
However, one of her sisters, who is a reality TV show fanatic, suggests she sign up for the hottest show of the moment, “Honeypot.” It's a competition where selected women are guaranteed $20,000 for the chance to win the keys to a single rich guy's heart. Conveniently, the show is supposed to take place in the City of Light—or so the contestants thought.
After being selected and getting the affection of one of the show’s producers, Dawn is ready to arrive at the home of the Eiffel Tower. But she is surprised by the production's prank, the primary reason for the movie's title, as it lands her in Paris, Texas, less than 100 kilometers from her home. Staying in the competition only for contractual reasons, she soon catches the interest of the millionaire of the moment, Trey McAllen III (Pierson Fodé), a handsome cowboy. Initially determined to be eliminated, throughout the challenges, typical reality show intrigues, and some moments outside the game, she allows herself to fall for him.
Review and Opinion
Home to many successful relationship reality shows, Netflix pokes fun at its own productions. From the start, “Honeypot” is presented as a self-critique, a proper parody of the reality show genre. The entire structure and the characters involved are stereotypes of the most common human types to expose themselves in front of the cameras: the rich and spoiled influencer, the old-school biker, the nerd, the free spirit, the forgotten celebrity, the alternative girl, etc.
The film was directed by Janeen Damian, who has experience in the romantic comedy genre, having also directed two other Netflix productions in the same style: ""Falling for Christmas"" and ""Irish Wish."" In ""The Wrong Paris,"" she includes all the common and pleasant elements of romantic comedies, making it quite predictable, which is no demerit. After all, when we watch movies or series of this type, we want an escape valve from our chaotic daily lives, where we have little or no control over what happens around us. The constant presence of Dawn’s family is an especially nice touch, acting as the viewer's voice within the film.
Especially her grandmother Bird, the emotional component of the plot, who repeatedly advises and encourages her granddaughter. Sometimes she interferes in the story in a way the most anxious viewer would want to do themselves. Miranda brings lightness and humanity to the film. It's perfectly possible to feel indignant with her about the ""villain's"" not-so-subtle advances on the handsome millionaire. She conveys the character's insecurities well and definitely makes us fall in love with her, too, an essential element for any decent romantic comedy. Pierson fulfilled what was necessary for his character, delivering someone who is attentive, caring, handsome, and very much in love with the protagonist. There could have been a slight bit more chemistry between the two characters (am I being nitpicky? Maybe).
With beautiful landscapes and an interesting cast, the film also stands out for the quality of its production, which is ideal for the romantic comedy genre. Despite this, the film's story could have been better worked out. At 1 hour and 4 minutes long, the extremely light story (a good sign) goes by too quickly. There could have been better development of the villain and the protagonist's confidante through dialogue between them and the protagonist. In my opinion, there could have been more candid dialogue between the main couple, giving a more solid basis for their romance. Some moments between Paris, Texas, and Paris, France seem to happen with a kind of “express love” without much emotional foundation. Maybe 15 more minutes of film wouldn't have hurt the production.
With a keen critique of the superficiality of influencers and the world of reality shows as a backdrop, and limited by the genre's formulas, it could have promised more than just a simple romantic comedy. It is a light and pleasant film for an afternoon when you just want to turn off your brain and disconnect from your busy routine with cute moments starring lovable characters. I think it was meant to be a single movie, but it could have a sequel that expands this wonderful universe, especially the relationship between Dawn and her family, particularly her sisters.

1nmd531,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmd531,Throwback to when Geeyou’s older bro Macks got bagged for county lines,"A drug dealing gang who brought high-purity cocaine from London to sell on the streets of Cardiff made an estimated £70,000 in profit in four months.

The five men, part of a so-called County Lines operation, were based in two houses in the Welsh capital which they used to store and sell dozens of cocaine deals.


Abdi Rahman Hassan, 20, Muktar Hassan, 22, Mahmud Mahmud, 20, David Miller, 35, and Aden Bashir, 19, were involved in the operation which ran from a flat in Dylan Place, Roath , where Miller lived, and a house in Threipland Drive, Heath , where Abdi Rahman Hassan, Muktar Hassan, and Mahmud were based.

Police became aware of the gang after tracking a known mobile phone number linked to drug dealing in Cardiff to the addresses.

They then observed Bashir, based at Miller’s flat in Dylan Place, carry out a number of drug deals over four months before raiding both addresses in June 2017. 

All five appeared for sentencing at Newport Crown Court on Monday, with Abdi Rahman Hassan appearing via video link from Wormwood Scrubs.


Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett described how the operation worked and how the gang was caught.y

He said: “Bashir was brought to the police’s attention supplying cocaine in the Newport Road area of Cardiff on June 7. The police followed him and tracked him back to David Miller’s house nearby in Dylan Place.

“Police observation revealed the house was being used as a base for Mr Bashir and he was repeatedly coming and going from that address at night and supplying people with wraps of cocaine on the streets of Cardiff for money.

“The other three defendants were at a second house a distance away from Miller’s home in the Heath in Threipland Drive. They kept in touch by telephone network. That house would have been where the larger supply of cocaine was kept and drugs would have been wrapped and bagged there to be sold by Bashir.

“There was a link between the two houses – a mobile telephone ending in 867. A phone using that number was brought into the Cardiff area and those who buy cocaine on a regular basis will discover the line is active and they will know the group of people are ready and willing to supply high-purity Class A drugs in the locality.

“They will call up that number and speak to someone in order to buy regular small amounts of cocaine. It’s therefore the location of that telephone number that is the central part of a conspiracy of this sort.”

It was claimed by Mr Bennett that Abdi Rahman Hassan played the leading role in the group with Muktar Hassan also playing a central part by having possession of the 867 number. They were receiving support and funding from people “higher up the chain” who have not been detected by police.

Bashir was seen as being at the bottom of the chain and would carry out the drug deals at night, being the most exposed to police observation.

Mahmud acted as a driver for the group, making three trips to London to pick up cocaine in a hired silver Volkswagen Golf, while Miller allowed his house to be used for the street dealing part of the operation and also acted as a driver, carrying out four trips to London to bring cocaine back to Cardiff in his black Ford Focus.

When Bashir was observed by police on June 7 he was seen approaching a man on a push bike and there was an exchange between the two men.

Shortly later a woman appeared and Bashir came out of Miller’s flat and spoke to the woman.

Mr Bennett said: “She was later found with two small cling film wraps of cocaine, 0.286grams of crack cocaine, worth a total of £30. That was tested at 93% purity.

“The mobile phone used by the female cocaine buyer was seized and the police tracked the number to the address of Dylan Place and back to the Threipland Drive address in Heath.”

On June 8 police executed an arrest warrant at Dylan Place and recovered a white iPhone and £165.47 from Bashir and they also recovered pieces of cling film, cling film boxes, a mobile linked to David Miller, and the black Ford Focus he had been using.


On the same day police went to Threipland Drive to execute a warrant and when they entered they noticed drug paraphernalia throughout the house including pieces of cling film on the coffee table, a bag of white powder hidden down the side of the sofa, and digital weighing scales.

The powder was 27.2g of 79% purity cocaine which had just been brought back from London for onward sale.

Mr Bennett said using the amount bought by the female drug buyer and the amount of cocaine found at Threipland Drive as an example, and the 867 phone records which recorded 79 drug deals, police were able to estimate that the group’s profit would have been in the region of £70,000.

All five defendants eventually pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply a Class A drug. Abdi Rahman Hassan was also due to be sentenced for the same charge in relation to another matter in London.

Defending Miller, Andrew Kendall said his client had been under pressure to become involved in the operation after receiving threats after racking up a cannabis debt.

Derrick Gooden, defending Bashir, said his client performed a limited function in the operation and there was an element of exploitation and naivete in his involvement.

Bridget Irving, defending Abdi Rahman Hassan, accepted her client was closely involved in the operation but described him as a trusted member of the group and no more than that. She said he also had a cannabis debt to pay off.

Defending Mahmud, Matthew Buckland said his client was only involved in the conspiracy for a short time and had been naive but added that Mahmud’s role was small.

And Abigail Bright, defending Muktar Hassan, said her client had shown “real insight and remorse” in this case and at the time of his offending he was a cannabis user which distorted his judgement.

Sentencing, Judge Richard Williams said: “This was an operation which betrayed large links to an organised crime group. Each of you played a part to develop and manage the supply and distribution of cocaine at street level in Cardiff and ferrying the result of that criminal enterprise back to London.


“I am satisfied that Abdi Rahman Hassan is regarded as playing the leading role in this conspiracy but other defendants have played a role affecting the conspiracy at different degrees.”

Abdi Rahman Hassan, of Longford Road, Barnet, London, was sentenced to four years and 10 months in prison with two years and one month added for the London charge.

Muktar Hassan, of Long Berrys, Cricklewood Lane, London, was sentenced to four years and eight months in jail.

Miller, of Dylan Place, Roath, Cardiff, was sentenced to four years imprisonment.

Mahmud, of Fuller Street, Hendon, London, was sentenced to a jail term of two years and eight months.

Bashir, of Portman Road, Manchester, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment.

1nmd3wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1nmd3wu/a_germans_perspective_of_japan/,A german‘s perspective of japan,"Hi, we’ve been to japan for around 20 days and I want to write down my impressions to make sure I have them saved somewhere but would also love to hear if some of you agree.
I want to highlight some things that really jumped out to me. I don‘t want to mention obvious things like how good the public transport is.

#1 The obsession with labels: there are labels and explanations EVERYWHERE. On the floor of public transport, on the walls of elevators, on the toilets, at the restaurants. There are labels everywhere that explain proper usage or behavior to ensure people know what the norm is.
I don‘t know if they expect people to really read all of these or they just love things to have a standard, but the amount of labels is insane.

#2 There are many jobs that just take care of proper process and supervision: people watching construction sites and make sure nobody enters or people at the train tracks that ensure trains take off on time.
It is really amazing how Japan prioritizes these things, where I‘d think in germany there would be a hard time to find people to do these jobs

#3 A lot of people work in „shitty“ jobs: like I said, people watching construction sites at 35 C hot weather in the summer. Jobs I would say nobody in germany would ever do, because here they would rather get government welfare than to work in those jobs

#4 A lot of japanese (ethnically japanese) people work in „low education“ jobs: things like 7-11, package delivery, construction site workers are in germany at least jobs that mostly are done by immigrants or people with immigrant background and not so much by germans

#5 there is no visual indication of educational status: People who one would say have low level jobs like cleaning lady for example are still very well dressed and if you‘d see them in the street, you would not be able to see their job. In germany I‘d say you can often tell visually the level of academic achievement

#6 Almost no kids & dogs around:
We were traveling with our baby, so we were really observant of kids and the japanese people (especially the grandmas) where really happy to see our baby, but it‘s very rare to come across someone who has a baby. Same for dogs, we very rarely (especially compared to germany), came across someone with a dog. I guess both speak towards Japanese people not having much time due to work

#7 old people work a lot and rarely use a walker.
The walker thing really irritated me. The old people in japan are often fit enough to walk themselves without a walker or other help, which shows how fit they are

#8 The obsession with high quality is INSANE: seing how a worker takes his time to make a good coffee and to see just how neatly they pack up things into a bag, it really gives one joy to see how dedicated they‘re to deliver a good product/experience


That‘s it for now. Maybe I‘ll add some later.

Do you guys agree?

We met last week on friday for a coffee, it was a 2 hour commute. For me it was incredible. We talked for 2 hours, laughed, then we walkted togehter through the rain to the train station. We said goodbye, where she mentioned that we should do that sometime again, and afterwards when she realiezd that her bus also still takes a while she asked if we could wait together and we chattet another 30 minutes. It was wonderful. Afterwards she wrote me that she hoped that I got homes safely and that she enjoyed the evening.

I already mentioned that I really want to see her again, I already invited her for a second date for dinner, which she agreed to, but she has a very important interview upcoming (she learned about it after she got home after our date) which she needs to prepare for, so she said she definately gets back to me after. We exchanged numbers since then, chattet a bit, she reacted to my whatsapp status a few times. We nearly messaged every day, but I would say it wasnt too in depth. A bit about music, I checked in with her at the start of the week and yesterday and thats it.

The thing is that she would need this job for her visa, so its really important for her (we live in germany, and she is an international student, she is about to finish her masters degree) and she also said it stresses her. Its why I try to keep it light, I dont want to take up a lot of her headspace when she needs to focus.

After messaging yesterday she told me that she has her interview on monday, I wished her all the best and I thought I'll let her focus over the weekend.  
But I am really anxious that she expects me to write more, or reach out more.  
She is an amazing women, and it was an incredible first date, and I really wish to keep seeing her, and it keeps occupying my mind, because I am constantly thinking I am communicating too much or too little.

How much would others in her situation expect the guy to message if they are interested? And would be a week/weekend of low communication destroy interest already?

Please dont tell me that I overthink this... I know that I do, but thats just how it is right now... I would just like to know what other people would expect in this situation...",1,1758411655.0,Advice,0,0.67,False

Purpose: I bought an older machine (C60) recently and now trying to determine whether or not the burrs should be replaced, or recalibrated internally. The grounds appear too coarse and don’t make much of a puck, even on the finest setting, and the espresso seems a bit too watery.  I can grind the same beans finer on a Mazzer Jolly grinder (commercial grade) and put into the bypass, and the Jura has no trouble extracting and then produces a well-formed puck and a great espresso.

I had the machine apart a couple weeks ago to do a thorough cleaning, so that’s not the issue. The burrs seemed not brand new, but reasonably sharp. I’m thinking when I go back in to replace a dripping steam dispensing valve I might be able to recalibrate the burrs a few clicks. Has anyone done this?",1,1758411408.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False

I interact normally labi na naa sa office, I laugh with my team if naay jokes and I thought na I'm getting better kay previously sa initial diagnosis kay Anxiety, Panic Attacks, and Depression, even naa ko sa office ga atubang sa laptop ug naay gibuhat kay mo kalit ra ko ug hinuktok makaluha dayun mo adtoh ko ug CR para adtoh mo hilak ug maayo.

Before I was skeptical about anang term na ""Depression"" kay abi lang naku na you're just sad and needed to take a break but as I experienced it grabeh kalisod, I'm at my lowest point of my life and ni kalit akong fiance ug biya and found out she was cheating(chat) but knowing the guy just lives 2 barangay's away from my fiance's province but luckily kay naa sa abroad ang guy. Na postponed ang wedding namo this year kay my mom died December 2024 and nagamit naku ang para sa kasal. 

I talked to her about moving the wedding and she agreed man pud, but karon nahebaw-an man iyang nabuhat, she wants na mag take a break sa daw mi sa amoang relationship by cool off. She asked me for how long, ni ingon ko ug betwee 1-2 years kay if magka okay mi ganahan ko na sure na jud ako decision ug dili naku ma bring up ang past issues. 

Karon, she has demands na dapat mo abot akoa monthly ug 90-100k kay gikapoy na daw sya ug trabaho. I was about to tell her na I turned down a job na ipa training ko sa US for 2 months and my compensation would be $17/hr but wala na naku gi sulti sa iyaha kay mag away napud mi kay maka ingon napud na siya akong gi blame. The CEO of the real estate company called me sa teams, we had a 40mins conversation kay why ni resign ko ug kalit and told him the truth na I don't want to have a mental breakdown sa US. The CEO undestood and told me na he was like that pud with his ex-wife pag divorce na he was so lost and depressed until na meet niya iyang current wife. 

So mao toh, I agreed with my fiancé's demands. All I could say is naa naku sa 70% sa goal, aside sa kiosk coffee franchise kay I invested sa MP2 and USDT via GoTyme. Naa pud d i isa iyaha na demands na dili ko dapat malapas ug 24hrs na dili makita naka online or ga online sa messenger kay mag overthink sya. It so happened na wala lang ko ganahi mag social media atong nakahebaw ko about sa ilaha and gi pasinganlan dayon ko na nakig taban ug lain.

Kung mo istorya ko sa akong mga sacrifices sa amoang relasyon kay ingnon dayon ko ug ""Nangwenta"" then kung siya ang mo hisgot sa akong mga mistakes pud kay okay ra. Ka unfair ba na wala gane naku gi mind na 6x ko ni byahe sa ilang province para magka istorya mi if unsa ba ni naa pa ba'y chance or wala na, Imagine same day flight nya mahal.

Not sure if what happened today was an autistic meltdown or something else entirely, like a PTSD-style breakdown.

Already started the day off to an emotional rough start. To give some background information, I had arrived to meet my mother at the farmers market. Because she was bringing a friend, I assumed they would be wandering around already since I arrived after them. Friend didn't come, which I didn't know while I was looking for them at the market. Cue several passive-aggressive and mean texts from said mother who said to just ""forget it"" and that she was leaving. Despite being able to see her walking away while still at the market and me calling her on my phone, she refused to answer my call while I was running towards her. She didn't say she would stay at the market until after I caught up with her and she made more snippy remarks in my direction. My mother has been like this ever since I was little, so I grew up with it.

This situation already pushed me very close to my emotional edge.

Then came my work shift at the coffee shop I work with (thing green mermaid logo). Today wasn't the first day she did this, but a younger coworker of mine snipped at me a couple of times in a very mean manner. I could feel myself losing control emotionally and just slammed my headset on the counter and said I had to take a minute. Proceeded to speed walk to the back stock room area where I ripped off my apron, slapped it against a box, and dropped to the floor and started hyperventilating and crying. 15 minutes later and I was still not close to recovering and was granted permission to go home early. I could barely get the request out and was trying desperately to control the tears but my eyes felt glassy the entire time. I still feel numb afterwards and it will probably take me the rest of the day to even halfway unwind.

About me:  
Just moved to Irvine and have been reading classic literature for about 2 years, and listen to podcasts like ""Jonathan Bi"" and ""Ascend"". I'm a professional mechanical engineer with a background in start-ups, and lifelong learner. 32 y/o for those concerned!  
  
Vision for the group:  
All educational backgrounds are welcome, from PhDs in philosophy to complete beginners. What's key is open-mindedness, curiosity and a willingness to be wrong. We'll meet at a coffee shop and discuss what we've read. I'll facilitate, but we should all bring critical questions that emerged from our time with the text. Outside of our meet ups I will create a group text thread, Discord or WhatsApp -- to be determined.  
  
Examples of The Great Books:  
\[  
""Sophocles – Oedipus Rex (classical Greek tragedy, dramatic form)"",  
""Plato – The Republic (ancient philosophy, political theory, dialogue)"",  
""Aristotle – Nicomachean Ethics (systematic philosophy, virtue ethics)"",  
""Virgil – The Aeneid (Latin epic, imperial myth-making)"",  
""Augustine – Confessions (Christian theology, autobiographical philosophy)"",  
""Dante Alighieri – The Divine Comedy (medieval Christian epic poetry)"",  
""Niccolò Machiavelli – The Prince (Renaissance political treatise)"",  
""Francis Bacon – Novum Organum (early modern philosophy of science, method)"",  
""William Shakespeare – Hamlet (Elizabethan drama, tragic play)"",  
""John Milton – Paradise Lost (17th-century English epic, theological and political poetry)""

What I'm looking for!  
  
1. You, if this sounds interesting. Please dm me to get more information and suggest a book you'd like us to start with. I'm looking to get a group of 5-10 together in the next month.  
  
2. A professor or author. I'd like to pay someone to facilitate the group if the option exists! Diving headlong into a book like Dante's Inferno might be best conducted with our own Virgil. If you're interested in facilitating our next session, let's chat.",6,1758410569.0,orangecounty,0,0.88,False

1nmcjkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/interracialdating/comments/1nmcjkf/am_i_being_unrealisticunreasonable_or_should_i/,Am I being unrealistic/unreasonable or should I move on?,"Hi yall, hoping to get some new perspectives here because I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable, or if my experience is common.

I (F25, Hispanic) and my partner (M30, Asian) have been together for about 4 years. In the beginning, everything was great, felt like the stars aligned. We connected instantly, had a long honeymoon phase (over a year), and were just so into each other.

Things started changing around 2.5 years in. The first big argument was about him not helping around his place (setting the table, cleaning, dishes, etc.). I told him I couldn’t be with someone who didn’t pull their weight/was comfortable with being a slob, especially since he talked about us moving in together. At first, he got offended, but eventually he did make more of an effort.

But over time I started noticing a big effort imbalance. At the start, we would both surprise each other with little things (coffee, dinners, trying new places) and try to have new experiences together. Later, I realized I was the only one still doing it. I was a full-time student working two part-time jobs, and he worked long hours too I still made the effort/time to plan dates, spend time thinking of the perfect/meaningful gifts, and come up with ways to spend quality time. Meanwhile, he would often blame it on just being “too tired” or “too busy.”

Some examples: I planned all our birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays. If I didn’t, nothing would happen.

I surprised him with gifts, food, little notes, flowers, and even big gestures like decorating his car for his birthday — he’d just give me a quick “thanks” say he liked it and move on.

He rarely planned dates or tried new activities with me. Saturdays he'd be up and at wrestling practice from 9-12, then workout more at home, so realistically he wouldn't be ready until around 4 or 5pm (and I mean this was every Saturday, like it was a routine and rarely moved it around). If I suggested things like a farmers market or morning hike, going to the gym together he never made the effort.

We'd get intimate only around 2-3 times a month.

Communication also dropped off. He’d text me in the morning, then I often wouldn’t hear from him until late evening. I felt like I was waiting all day just to hear from him. 

What hurt the most was feeling like he didn’t prioritize me. For example, I’d asked him for years to take me dancing/club at least once in a while (I love to dance), but he never did. After about 4 years of asking him to go it wasn’t because of me — it was for his friend’s birthday. I got really annoyed that when I asked every time for him to accompany me, there was an excuse but for his friend, he was able to rearrange his training/time to go and stay out late. 

Over the last year especially, I felt more like I was single than in a relationship. I wanted the kind of effort I gave — not constantly, but at least sometimes. A thoughtful note, flowers “just because,” planning a date where all I had to do was show up, or dressing up for me once in a while, when I get dressed up I'd like something more than ""pretty"" (never called me beautiful), he never took pictures of me/us, but I was always taking pictures of him/us. I don't think he started opening the car door for me until around 3 and a half years in, again only cause I asked him to/said I'd appreciate if he did that. I even made an effort to learn his language and asked if he can at least make a small effort to start learning mine. 

The final straw was realizing that if he couldn’t show up for me now, how would he show up in a marriage, or when kids were involved? I expressed that I don't want to be in a marriage like our parents where our moms have to buy themselves flowers on mothers day, or have to hold out on attending concerts or going out to a fancy dinner because their husbands don't feel like it/say they have too much work. I also said that I would want the father of my kids to be involved in their lives and make time for them, but how can I expect that for him if he's not even doing that for me. I encouraged him to find a better work-life balance, but he'd just say ""yea I know"" and things wouldn't really change. It felt like life was passing us by, and I was the only one trying to make it meaningful.

I feel like Im the one constantly carrying the bigger effort load, I know relationships aren't supposed to be 50/50 all the time, but it's been like this for a while now, it's tiring where even my guy/girl friends joke saying that I'm the boyfriend & the girlfriend. I won't accept his excuse that he's not ""good at relationships"" cause during the first 2 years, the effort, care and thoughtfulness was there. 

So here’s my question for the guys here:

Is this kind of withdrawal/low effort normal in long-term relationships? Do men just naturally “settle in” and stop doing the little things? I'll be honest and say maybe this is where my unrealistic expectations come from, but i kinda thought when a guy loves his girlfriend, yk these things come kinda natural because you have this want to do it for them/make them feel special...I understand maybe lack of relationship experience may play a part, but with the right person, it sort of ""clicks"" in a sense and/or they brings this loving behavior out of you. I've brought this up to him multiple times, about every 4-6 months for 2 years but recently since this February and that friends bday party, I starting to think i need to move on since when he does ""change"" it only lasts for 2 weeks and back to the same cycle. 

If your partners voiced concerns like this, what would y'all/did y'all do to improve?

(I’d also appreciate any perspective on whether I was asking for too much. Am I being unrealistic in wanting these certain actions/efforts, or is it fair to expect some reciprocity?)",1,1758410153.0,interracialdating,2,1.0,False
1nmci24,https://www.reddit.com/r/onionheadlines/comments/1nmci24/kristi_noem_is_going_to_have_a_good_day_today/,Kristi Noem Is Going To Have A Good Day Today,"SIOUX FALLS, SD — After an unprecedented string of fortunate events, Governor Kristi Noem is currently enjoying what political insiders are calling a “miraculous bubble of unthreatened tranquility.” Today, she will not be assassinated, no one will steal her purse, no puppies will meet untimely ends, and even the geese along her jogging route have promised to behave.

But sources warn that this calm is fragile. “We can confirm she will have a good day today,” said one aide, speaking under strict anonymity. “Tomorrow… that’s a different story entirely. Tomorrow, the universe has not RSVP’d.”

Rumors are swirling about a series of ominous potential events scheduled for the next 24 hours. Meteorologists predict rogue hailstorms of political cartoons, and security analysts warn that an army of caffeinated squirrels may descend on the State Capitol. Pigeons trained in the art of tactical harassment are said to be in flight.

Legal experts caution that federal prosecutors might finally remember that threatening politicians is against the law—and also decide that Kristi Noem deserves a subpoena herself, just to keep things balanced. Even the coffee machines are reportedly on edge, threatening to deliver either scalding lava-hot espresso or lukewarm betrayal.

“Today is safe,” said political chaos consultant Hank Dribble. “Tomorrow… I wouldn’t leave the house. The calendar doesn’t forgive, the Wi-Fi might betray you, and yes… the puppies could still die. It’s all very unclear.”

Noem herself has taken precautions, including wearing three different shades of protective lip balm and rehearsing a dramatic shrug in the mirror, in case cosmic forces decide tomorrow is the day for minor civil catastrophes—or major ones.

For now, she basks in today’s miracle. But tomorrow? Sources say it’s a toss-up between mild inconvenience, existential dread, and perhaps the sudden appearance of a feral raccoon with a vendetta.",6,1758410038.0,onionheadlines,1,0.87,False

TLDR: Wife and I have a long 2 years of challenges and lost connection. Feels like we’re nearing separation. 

M(38) and F(37) married almost 10 years, close to separation. 

I’ve been married to my wife for 9 years. We have 2 kids (6 and 3).  The past 2-3 years have been tough. We’ve faced numerous challenges.  

I was laid off from a job back in 2023 as my wife was starting a real career.  We went through a big move around the same time.  It felt like we were disconnected around that time.  Around that time I discovered she was FaceTiming with a new male coworker when she was traveling.  Something that was innocent (I do believe this) but she was hiding from me. It took me a while to get over but I’ve forgiven it. 

Within about a year and another big move, my mom came to visit.  Their relationship has always been very shaky.  Might categorize it as toxic.  The last visit July 2024, my mom took my wife to a coffee shop and essentially laid into her with a barrage of aggressive words.  When I found out about it and they got home, I told my mom she wasn’t welcome at my house anymore.  She left.  

At that point my wife went into a state of depression.  About 2 weeks after the incident with my mom she came home from a trip, and tossed around the idea of us separating without saying those words.  Since then you could say I’ve become extremely anxiously attached.  It felt like it caught me by surprise.  

We worked through it. A few months later I discovered my testosterone levels were incredibly low. I began supplementing to get to a normal level. My sex drive went through the roof, my wife’s plummeted do to being on antidepressants.  It created a lot of issues. Around that time still having attachment anxiety, I was almost looking for proof she was disconnected.  The more I perceived her pulling away, the more I would get bothered, then I would explode saying pretty mean things.  I wasn’t even sure if she was right for me at that time period cause it just felt like the spark wasn’t there.  And when I say spark, I continuously communicated to her that it felt like she wasn’t attracted to me, it felt like she just didn’t have that same energy she used to.  
Then the arguments came- eventually things got to me so much I started blowing up.  Saying things like “it feels like you don’t know how to make me happy.”  After what felt like a Father’s Day that fell short, pressuring her to make sure my birthday felt special. Insinuating she had gotten boring because she didn’t like to ever drink anymore.  A lot of messed up things were said.  

Since then we both realize there’s a major disconnection.  She claims I broke her during that period of emotional abuse.  She won’t forgive me for it after I’ve profusely apologized and shown a change in my character and behavior.  

She thinks I need a level of love she’s not capable of giving at this point in her life.  I’m just looking for a connection.  We both want our marriage to work but it feels like we keep inching towards a true separation.  

After the last month of sleeping in a separate bedroom, I left town for 2 nights.  While I was out of town she sent me a long letter essentially with terms.  She wants to give our marriage another shot but has laid out things that aren’t negotiable.  Not questioning her loyalty, not allowing anyone in my family to mistreat her, not holding her work travel against her, giving her time and space right now, eventually starting to date again and rebuilding a connection. 

After that letter we had a fantastic week of closeness. A strong connection. Thursday rolled around and she had to leave for work. Our 3 YO’s daycare was closed due to power outages the night before. I called out of work to be with him.  There wasn’t any acknowledgement or appreciation from her. It bugged me, for the whole day. The next day as she was returning, I carefully worded and approached the situation like this- “ hey I know we’re rebuilding, but I think it’s important to acknowledge and show appreciation for each other when the other one steps up at home.”  Boom- complete mood shift.  Complete tone change.  It led to a giant argument- huge.  One thing about my SO is that she has never been able to take any type of feedback or criticism.  It gets immediately defensive- sometimes that’s been my fault with how I’ve approached situations but I’ve been really careful about how I word and approach things now.  That situation turned into how I shouldn’t need acknowledgment and appreciation for these things and how there are plenty of times where she steps up without expecting any type of recognition. The truth is, she travels for work at least once every 2 weeks for 1-3 days and sometimes shit happens that I need to handle with our kids.  In the past I’ve almost resented her for it cause it’s felt like I’m a single dad at times.  Regardless I’ve told her I don’t care about her travel for her job, but she needs to realize that sometimes it’s not easy being at home with the boys. Sometimes we have help but that’s usually just during working hours so I can do my job. 

Well that argument got really ugly and turned into her saying she’s sleeping upstairs, and we’re going to find another place to rent.  That was 2 days ago.  The next morning we spoke, she did say as of now she does want to look into another place to live that we’d split.  But she said that’s how she feels now and that could change.  Since then we’ve been affectionate with each other. But not sure if we’re on the same page in terms of where we’re headed. 

I know she doesn’t have the mental energy for me bringing up any issues at this point. I really don’t know what to do or where to go next.  We’ve gone counseling in the past. I’ve expressed need for doing it again. I don’t think she’s ready.  Part of me just wants to give up. Why am I expending so much time and energy trying to be with someone that doesn’t feel the same way about me.  What’s the best way I can handle this situation?

1nmcbha,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1nmcbha/i_think_this_medication_has_taken_away_my/,I think this medication has taken away my creativity.,"
I recently got medicated for bipolar 2. Antipsychotics. It’s been about 2 weeks since, I think? Partly I feel better. I feel more present in reality, it feels like I can actually see depth, and I’m not constantly at war with myself, except at night and when I drink coffee. 

I started a creative project soon after getting on these pills and while I’m proud of my work… I can really sense the exact origin of every single idea. Nothing is original: what I’m making is just an amalgamation of ideas from other things that have done better than I ever will. My work will probably be received as a cheap copy of its inspirations. I feel so clumsy, trying to steer it in another direction.

When I was off my meds, and in a good mood, I’d have what felt like a truly unique and powerful perspective on the world. So powerful that I considered trying to make my own pseudo fictional religion that constituted a new outlook on spirituality. Yeah, that’s a bit crazy, but I promise I didn’t mean to self-aggrandize, I was aware on some level that it was fake. But the projects I worked on in the past were original, probably? 

Nothing is original. My words are from a language that doesn’t belong to me, and my choice of words doesn’t belong to me, and the meanings of my words belong to the people hearing them. I know that in the past, true expressions of myself just caused people to act like I was on drugs, or crazy. I feel like I’m explaining things better but in some ways I really liked it better when I talked in nonsense",5,1758409531.0,bipolar2,1,0.86,False

CREDIT PROFILE
  
* Current credit cards you are the primary account holder of:
   * Capital One Quicksilver
   * American Express Blue Cash Preferred
   * American Express Gold
* FICO scores with source: Experian 782
* Oldest credit card account age: 6 years, 9 months
* Youngest credit card account age: 3 years, 9 months
* Annual income $: $78,750

CATEGORIES

* Ok with category-specific cards?: Yes
* Ok with rotating category cards?: No
* Estimate average monthly spend in the categories below.
   * Dining $: 100 (eat out once (maybe twice) a month, plus coffee a couple of times a week)
   * Groceries $: 375 (Wegmans primarily)
   * Gas $: 0
   * Travel $: $130 a month public transport, one long-distance vacation per year (pencil this in at $2k? Just to be safe.)
   * Using abroad?: No
   * Other categories or stores: $20 a month Spotify Family Plan, $72 a month on various streaming services (Disney bundle, Netflix, Crunchyroll, a couple sports-specific services)
   * Pay rent by card? No

I am definitely looking to move on from the Quicksilver (I tried an upgrade to the Savor, but I was told I can only upgrade to the Venture cards. Also, I only kept this around due to it being my oldest line of credit) and the Gold (I'm forcing myself to use the Uber credit and I don't use the other dining credit, so even though the 4x points is nice, the AF isn't worth it). I have three choices for replacements:

1. WF Active and CSP. **Pros:** flat 2% cash back on the WF, a good SUB and 3x dining for the CSP, and if I spend $2k on travel (which is reachable with a roundtrip economy flight and a week in a good hotel), the AF is paid off. **Cons:** the 3% streaming is redundant with the BCP's 6%, have to use the travel portal to get the 5x points (it's 2x outside of the portal), I have 3 cards split across 3 ecosystems.

2. CFU and CSP. **Pros:** Fixes the ""3 cards, 3 ecosystems"" issue noted above. **Cons:** 1.5% cash back instead of 2%

3. WF Active and WF Autograph Journey. **Pros:** flat 2% on the Active, 3x dining on the Journey matches the CSP, don't need to use a portal to get the desired travel points rates, two cards in one ecosystem. **Cons:** SUB is not as good as CSP, it's Wells Fargo, and I heard the points transfer isn't as good as Chase.

Which of the three do you think is best for me? Or is there a secret fourth option that I am not considering?",2,1758409499.0,CreditCards,3,1.0,False

1nmc88g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrisbaneSocial/comments/1nmc88g/northside_emotionally_secure_genuine_friendships/,Northside - Emotionally secure genuine friendships,"Hi everyone 

I'm Ali, recently moved to Brisbane a couple of years ago and bought a house. I'm not planning on moving anytime soon so I thought I'd put myself out there and look for lasting friendships. 

A little about me, 31M childfree by choice. A DevOps nerd by trade, spend most evenings at the gym, and weekends in my garden with my dog. In my downtime I'm either reading self development books or sim racing. 

I'm looking to connect with people 25+ (I really don't mind if you're younger as long as you're emotionally secure or working towards it) on the northside who value emotional intelligence, self-awareness, personal growth, and living life genuinely. I’m not so much after superficial fun or party vibes, but more stable, secure, and genuine friendships.

If this resonates with you, please hit me up, let's grab a coffee! 

Regards, 

Ali
