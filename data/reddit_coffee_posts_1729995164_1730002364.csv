1gd2rzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1gd2rzy/my_son_is_the_main_caregiver_and_other_lies/,‚ÄòMy son is the main caregiver‚Äô and other lies. ,"
Can‚Äôt wait to see you weigh in on this redditors! 

I have a 5 year old, a 2 year old and third on the way and today - she told me that her son is the main caregiver and all I do is work. 

My husband and I have a fantastic relationship. We communicate well, are equals in the home and fill different roles. My husband works 7 x 24 hour shifts a month (he‚Äôs a firefighter) so he is home most days. When he is gone, I do 100% of everything. I also work a regular 9-5 and once a year put on a really awesome community event which takes some extra time for a couple months. 

We‚Äôre in a full home renovation right now, and  so things are busy but we spend quality time with the kids. 


His MOTHER has always disrespected and belittled me. When I was pregnant last time and had to be hospitalized she didn‚Äôt even offer to get me water when she visited me. She told me that she had to do it all on her own. She has no compassion.  

I‚Äôm pregnant now and am super exhausted and nauseous and she sat on the couch and told me to go bed but there was food and leftovers to put away and the house was a mess and instead of offering to help, she told me that I am a bad partner for putting my house before my husband. 

She had told me numerous times that I work too much and her son is our main caregiver (ummm I‚Äôm sorry - what?!). 

I ask her all the time to do quality things together, like go shopping, visit a market, get coffee, pick pumpkins‚Ä¶do a craft with the kids. She flat out says no to everything (she doesn‚Äôt like crafts, or playdough, or colouring, or games) and tells me I take too long when I go out (she doesn‚Äôt like to leave the house for longer than an hour). 

When I ask her to help with the kids bath, or read them a story, or suggest going to the library - she tells me I take advantage of everyone telling them to do things so I don‚Äôt have to do them because I‚Äôm ‚Äôtoo busy‚Äô 

She refused to help me pack boxes when we moved because she ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt  want to‚Äô. I paid for dinner to have my friends come over and help and flew my mom out from across Canada ;she‚Äôs 70!) to help while she sat on the couch on her iPad. 


She told me my husband is taking care of the kids while I take ‚Äòvacations‚Äô (my friends 40th for 4 days, visiting my mom because she has cancer, and a funeral) 

I‚Äôve spent countless hours supporting her, trying to spend time with her, and she is just so negative. It‚Äôs hard to be around. 

She‚Äôs great with my little one, but so mean to my 5 year old for no reason. 

I appreciate that she helps by babysitting, but we always pay for dinner, we thank her, she offers and she loves her grandkids. We do a or for her too, like watch her dog, change her tires etc. 

The issue is she is so rude to me. It‚Äôs been like this forever. And I honestly have never experienced this. I usually get along with everyone. If I started trying to stand up for myself saying things like ‚Äòwhat you‚Äôre saying is untrue and rude. Please stop‚Äô. And she just jumps at me. 

She told me tonight my husband does everything and all I do is work and demand things from him - and a lot of other completely ridiculous untrue, hurtful things. 

She was a stay at home mom to four kids during a time when one salary was enough. That‚Äôs not the case now. She doesn‚Äôt keep a super clean home and doesn‚Äôt care about what her place looks like so it‚Äôs hard to hear what she has to say sometimes because I like a nice home. 
 
I‚Äôm at the point where I don‚Äôt want her help, or even to have her in my home. I hate the negativity and feeling disrespected.  

What should I do? Should I grin and bear it for my husband‚Äôs sake? Should I finally stand up for myself and call her out? Should I try to get back at her? I have no other family support, but right now, I hate her. It‚Äôs tearing me apart because she makes me feel like a bad partner, mother, and person.

Even my friends and neighbors have commented on how she treats me and my daughter, and I‚Äôm just so fed up with her attitude and lack of consequences. It‚Äôs not OK, but what do I do?",1,1730002179.0,motherinlawsfromhell,0,1.0,False

1gd2o6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/lepin/comments/1gd2o6k/shanghai_haul/,Shanghai Haul,"As mentioned earlier, I was happy that US Customs (returning home) wasn't interested when I answered ""Toys"" when he asked if i had anything to declare.

All of these were from AP Plaza.

Natural History Museum was 500 RMB (about $70) and it originally came in a complete box. It would have never fit in any of the suitcases, so I cut off the panels, and upon returning home, did a neater job. So most of the box made it, but not in one piece, LOL.

https://preview.redd.it/43txlgwiy7xd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5917320ae2feba5b92f3309d04dd55a0ca777ea6

After dumping the museum off at the hotel, I went back, and the Brown Store owner really wanted me to get the Slushee Van (copy of LEGO). I looked up the Ali Express prices back at the hotel, and got a better idea of what it should cost. I said, ""I can get it cheaper on Aliexpress"", so he finally undercut Ali at 60 RMB ($8.43). I'm borrowing the cylinders on the roof as a stand-in for my upscaled LOZ Space Lab. Another box that had to be trimmed down.

https://preview.redd.it/w1t9d9ojy7xd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41581e79631cbbf821e1a60dd0f29b8232b36ad8

There is a really nice, proper, modern store at AP Plaza called ""Toy C Play"" that has many different types of toys. They had a few shelves of bricks sets. But All I really wanted was these little street vendor sets by Wekki. 16RMB ($2.25). In comparison, a cup of Starbucks coffee is 35RMB at AP Plaza (but I really appreciated the air conditioning there, so I bought coffee).

So, if you're looking for a vacay in Shanghai, go for it! No Google, no Yahoo (but Yahoo mail works), no random free Wifi on the Metro or just being out and about. So do your homework beforehand and list the stuff you might want and the typical Ali prices. So when it comes time to negotiate, you KNOW that the first price he quotes is ridiculous! (Museum's starting price was 1200 RMB. Shushee Van was 200 RMB!).

Oh, and the Shanghai Metro does not turn on A/C in the stations, so dress comfortably.

I took the car to our son's soccer game 1.5 hours away and heard a pulley/ the belt squeaking when I first cranked it but thought nothing of it because it is smoothed out pretty quick. It ran perfectly fine there and back.

I'm guessing/hoping/praying it's a head gasket issue. Do I have to pull the front cover off the engine to replace the gasket or can I get to it from here? Are there any ""how-tos"" to help walk me through it?

‚òïÔ∏è Orange Fizz (‚Ç±180+SC): orange juice + espresso ra gyud guro ni. I don‚Äôt think there was a sweetener, or at least I couldn‚Äôt taste it. It‚Äôs an acquired taste I guess since I was not much of a fan. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\
üçµ Hojicha (‚Ç±180+SC): let them know how you like the sweetness because they don‚Äôt put in sweeteners unless you tell them. They use decent hojicha powder, most likely an A class, and make it using the Koicha method. Interestingly, they whisk in the sugar together with the powder. As a latte, the milk overpowers the hojicha a bit lang. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\
üç∞Coconut Cream Pie (‚Ç±280+SC): I‚Äôd expect more sweetness from a meringue+yema combo, pero sakto sakto ang iyang sweetness. Lami ipares sa pait pait nga kape or pure matcha. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\

What I love:\
üñäÔ∏èSelection and brewing of filter coffees\
üñäÔ∏èthe geaaars: Orea, Stagg Kettle, La Morzocco! If you are into coffee brewing, you‚Äôd really appreciate the gears on the counter. And it applies not just to the coffee but to the tea, too: Chawan and chasen were used to prepare the hojicha.\
üñäÔ∏èdem aesthetics‚ú® Naa sad siya speakesy sa kilid nga nindot ang bar\

What I don‚Äôt really like much:\
üñäÔ∏èthe pricing ü•≤ It would probably make sense if the SC is incorporated into the list price. For most of the items, di jud ma justify ang pricing.\

On another note: the place gets overrun by rich kids real fast so best to visit early if you want peace. Also visit early for parking dibs.\

Verdict: mubalik ko to try other interesting beans but probably not for everything else. The premium pricing is attributable not so much to the overall taste of the food/drink offerings, but to the aesthetics (and probs to cover for the uber expensive gears).\",3,1730001204.0,CebuRestaurantReviews,0,1.0,False

Fantasy: they try to be real slick with claims about having ""great"" relationships with ""many""  hiring managers at ""great"" companies.  All one has to do is interview well, and bingo ... the contracting job is yours!

Reality: the hiring managers I talked with were actually decent enough human beings, and that's where the pleasantness ends.  The companies tended to be garbage from a Wall Street perspective ($1 stock price) or no longer in business.  If you make a suggestion about a company you'd like to work for, it's not ""currently"" on the agencies' client lists (i.e., ""never will be"").

Even worse, these agencies don't do their research.  Example: does the hiring manager actually have hiring authority?  Not with one company I talked with.  My application was left to disappear like a fart in the wind due to some political strife between the HM and one of his colleagues.

Is there flexibility for the role to convert to FTE?  ""Yes,"" said the agency.  ""No,"" said the hiring manager.

""Let's meet over coffee, and we'll talk about other places where can present you."" 
""Sure,"" I reply, only to be asked to reschedule for another day, and ultimately ghosted.

These places can't even correctly process requests for ""do not contact,"" which is what I did for both. But I kept getting emails and calls from them.

1gd2ewn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1gd2ewn/showing_support_with_microtips/,Showing support with micro-tips,"I'm toying around with the idea of creating an online donation platform. It'll set itself apart from other platforms in that it encourages people to give many small ""tips"" instead of fewer larger donations. This tips can be for either individuals or for companies - basically, the end goal is to try and create another revenue chanel for people/websites so they don't have to rely as much on ads or selling data in order to provide free online products. Perhaps that vision is a little ambitious, but still, I see any step in that general direction as a good thing.

There's a few different ideas I'm juggling around, but at the moment I'm leaning towards something like this:

You make an account with the online tipping platform, and put X dollars into in monthly. Then you install a browser extension. As you browse the web, the extension will scan the pages you visit, look for donation information, and then show a lit-up icon if it found something. If you want to donate, click on the extension, it'll show you who it found on the page that you can donate to (so you can verify that you're donating to the correct place), and then you just push a button to throw some pennies/dimes at them.

The donations won't actually go out until the end of the month (so you can always undo if you need to). Whatever money didn't get donated will automatically be sent to a charity of your choice.

This whole process is intended to make donation feel as streamlined as possible - the extension makes it very easy to donate with a couple of button presses, plus it's easier to part with your money if you know you've already parted with it - it's either going to a charity or to this website you're currently viewing.

## The hurdles

1. This system really only works if there's lot of people available to donate to.

I don't want to require people to sign up to the platform before they can receive donations, instead, I'd like it if the platform was capable of working with the internet as it exists today. So this extension I want to develop has to be able to sniff out donation information from a website without there being any kind of standard way to do it.

Basically, this means it'll search the page for any buy-me-a-coffee/paypal/whatever links, and if it find them, it'll light up and let you donate to them. You can also hand-enter donation information into the platform's website if you have the information on hand and you'd like to toss a few pennies their way.

I'm also thinking about letting you donate to email addresses as a way to make it possible to donate to even more places (because there aren't a lot of places online that have donation links available). Basically, you'd go to a website/bloggers/whoever's contact page, find their email, plug it into the platform, and say how much you'd want to donate.

2. It's unfortunately not possible to just donate a few cents to someone.

Transactions have processing feeds that make it impractical to pay someone anything less than a couple dollars - they tend to cost a flat fee plus a percentage of whatever is being sent. Here's roughly how I'm thinking of handling this problem:
1. At the month's end, if a person has received more than, lets say, five bucks from various donors, we can just hand them the money. In the case of donating to an email, it'll be a higher threshold of, say, $25, and if it passes that threshold, they'll receive an automated email notifying them that users want to donate to them, and asking them to fill out some form to receive their money.
2. Whatever money is left will go into a lottery-like system - All of the remaining money will be pooled together, then it'll be handed out in smaller chunks (like $5 or $25) random receivers from that pool. If someone was supposed to receive four bucks, they'll be more likely to win this mini lottery compared to someone who only had 2 cents donated to them.

If you donate a chunk of money to an email address, and they never choose to receive it, your money will simply be sent to your chosen charity instead - as if it never got donated to them. I'll also take note that they never responded to the donation, and will avoid emailing them again until, say, they're receiving $250 in one go instead of $25 - or something like that.

Thoughts? Concerns? Suggestions? Feedback?

Would you use something like this if it was available?

Also... this isn't technically an app - hope that's ok for this subreddit? I mean, eventually there might be an app for it as well to help support mobile devices, because browser extensions don't tend to work so well on mobile.

My knees throughout the day has this anxious feeling inside them but is associated with them giving out like they're weak and can't support me. My right leg almost every night develops this fizzy feeling in the shin area and muscle twitching in the calves. I don't have the urge to move but moving does stop it. This worsens at night and particularly when laying down to sleep. 

Back in July I woke up at 5am to my right knee tickling sensation worsening until I had to involuntarily shake my leg and it eased off, hasn't happen since. 

These symptoms have slowly gotten better (less intense) overtime to now but sometimes it's worse. Exercise intensifies the sensations. It doesn't really affect my sleep or prevent me from sleeping at this time. 

I've seen a neurologist who gave MRI scans of my spine and brain and found bulging discs in upper-mid and lower area of the spine but believe it does not cause these sensations. Nerve conduction test on my right leg showed up nothing. Ultrasound on my legs for veins showed nothing wrong either. But neurologist and my GP are firm that this is not RLS but can't explain what's going on either and placed me in the basket of Functional Neurological Disorder. 

I have been keeping up taking magnesium, iron supps, vitamin D and potassium - doesn't have impact. Not on any medications, don't drink alcohol or coffee. I do smoke here and there but it doesn't really change symptoms whether I've stopped or not.

Sorry for the rant but I've been convinced since the start I have RLS because I guess apart from not necessarily having the *urge* to move, everything else seems to line up with it and maybe it's a mild form? ",1,1730000744.0,RestlessLegs,1,1.0,False

About a week before she turned 3, the tantrums started getting more intense and she began to be more and more stubborn. 

She used to leave the house and go anywhere with us but now it‚Äôs 50/50. Either she‚Äôs really excited to go or she wants to keep playing and getting her shoes on and out the door becomes near impossible. She‚Äôll throw herself on the floor or run to her room and go limp child if we try to pick her up. This goes for other things like taking her drops for food allergies, bedtime or going potty. It‚Äôs either super easy if it‚Äôs on her terms or impossible. Her go-tos when she‚Äôs mad is throwing things, screaming words she mad up or going up to the door and telling us she‚Äôs leaving because we‚Äôre mean.

We used to have zero issues with taking her to restaurants, coffee shops or grocery shopping. She would quietly play with her toys or talk to us. She has since began having really strong opinions on where she wants to be. Today was the worst tantrum I‚Äôve experienced yet. I decided to treat her to chick fil a (her favorite).

In that dream, I dreamed that Caillou Anderson (from r/caillou ) went to Alec Celik's residence and shrunk him as revenge on Fiorella Ricci, Alec's adoptive daughter and classmate of Caillou. Unlike Fiore's feud with Gwen (DramaRama version), Fiore is not the aggressor between herself and Caillou. Connor Blake, Alec's friend and uncle figure to Fiore, enters the room and sees Fiore angry and Alec now very tiny. Alec (now tiny) is standing on the coffee table telling Connor and Fiore what Caillou had done. Because Connor is the only adult in the house, he now has to drive himself, Fiore, Caillou, and a shrunken Alec (who is in Fiore's palm) over to the Anderson place. Connor angrily tells Boris (the dad) and Doris (the mom) about what Fiore's classmate and nemesis Caillou had done. Boris is angry about this. Boris grows Alec back to normal and he, Fiore, and Connor head back home. Caillou gets grounded.",1,1729999648.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False
1gd22t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gd22t5/my_shortish_review_of_the_remake_with_some_extra/,"My short-ish review of the remake, with some extra stuff :)","extra stuff being, some questions and things i‚Äôd like to discuss. i‚Äôll be getting into that later.

first off, what an amazing game. i watched my sister play the originals when i was a child, and its a franchise that hasn‚Äôt ever slipped my mind when thinking about horror. i remember the puzzles being way too hard for my small brain to comprehend so i never personally finished a game, but it was always near and dear to me. its like my brain has taken screenshots of a few moments here and there (finding the pipe in the garage, the monsters in the fog, things of that nature). when i found out about the remake, obviously i was elated. 

i‚Äôll keep my review as short as possible as im sure none of this is new commentary. it‚Äôs a masterfully crafted game with brilliant level design that authentically moves you through the game and guides you from objective to objective. it has a wonderful way of rewarding exploration and curiosity. the combat system is great, smooth and rewards mastery (of its not so high ceiling, but nevertheless is satisfying to get a hold of). the game is amazing at making you feel like a true schizo, with its art and sound design. things like writings on the wall, slight changes to the environment triggered by events, and this specific thing that i loved in blue creek apts where the enemies behind the metal grates kept moving upon your returns to the clock room. those are just some examples.

i should also add i had quite a unique experience with this game. i knew of the plot point that james had killed mary. but the town and the rest of the story was completely new. it felt as if the story unfolded to me as it would to james. the posters in the town such as the one saying ‚Äúspill the beans over an honest cup of coffee!‚Äù made my experience truly special. as i felt the lingering guilt james felt. often thinking, ‚Äúthey know‚Äù, or ‚Äúdo they know?‚Äù as i went through the game. my paranoia, guilt and denial was reverberated by angela upon the second encounter with her. where she says ‚Äúhow did you know that?‚Äù, when james had simply made a logical assumption. that shared paranoia extended through to me, and again, made it truly a special experience. a masterclass in instilling fear, doubt, and anxiety. 

and the acting??? my god the acting. james actor was AMAZING. every line, every sigh, every breath, every facial expression, real, authentic, and so fucking good. like the first encounter with a monster where james raises his eyebrows, dumbfounded at what appears to be a‚Ä¶ sort of human? in the distance was *chefs kiss* angela brought me to tears with her performance, and maria had me utterly confused and conflicted at every turn. 

those are the thoughts i wanted to share :) i have some questions and things of interest i‚Äôd also like to mention.

is maria aware that she is a manifestation? is she conscious of the fact that she is not real? that she is not someone who was born and lived a whole life? or was she manifested as a crazy person who is unaware of their non existence (in the sense that her existence is dependent on james)? 

i saw a brief mention that the dead bodies with notes all around are reused models of james. about this, some questions/thoughts-

in subscribing to the theory that james is in purgatory (a loop): an old map with scribbles very similar to how james does map scribbles is found alongside a body. later, when james finds that old map in neelys bar, the memory thingy happens. is this referring to the memory of us (the player) viewing it, or james in a previous loop? moreover, would that mean james has died in those locations where we find those bodies and failed his rite of passage? if not subscribing to that theory, then what is the explanation behind those bodies/the old map and its memory interaction?

in the canteen where we had jumped down a hole and found eddie, there is a painting there. one of the cafeteria itself, and the dead body we find sitting on the bench. the one eddie (jokingly) claims to have killed. whats the deal with this? 

also, what‚Äôs the deal with that prison in general? and the holes that go from one place to another? to what degree was it real? the staircase from the historical society, was that real? if it was kinda real, was it set in the past? as the first note on the desk is dated in the 1800‚Äôs iirc. what is the significance of that? 

what‚Äôs the deal with the three crucial patients? as i assume it can‚Äôt be james angela and eddie, since we find the patient card for james in the otherworld of the hospital under a different patient number, with very obvious clues that that card is referring to him. 

there is a painting in the prison of someone being skewered. it says something along the lines of ‚Äúthe last taste of freedom for a prisoner, to choose whether they die by hanging or skewering‚Äù. is this relevant to the noose we pull that drops us into the labyrinth? 

moreover, what happens if we get the answer wrong/right? 

when james encounters angela in the park, angela is triggered when james mentions a ‚Äúlittle girl‚Äù. i assume this is the case because of her abuse when she was young, a trauma response. she says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not supposed to be here‚Äù, to who exactly was she referring to? 


that is all! if you‚Äôve read this far i‚Äôd love to hear what you think and discuss this amazing game. thank you for coming to my yap sesh.

TLDR: amazing game. 10/10. my questions are below the 6th paragraph.

I do not mind your age and your intentions. This is a throwaway and I wouldn't mind sharing my main when we get talking. I have spoken to a lot of people here, most are very nice and hope I find another person like who I can meet in real person.

I have been living in Hyderabad for the past 20 years and if everything goes right I would be leaving the country this January. But, before that I would like to tick certain things off of my bucket list here in this city and country, which includes going on solo travels, road trips and city explorations with strangers.

About me - I am 6ft 2in dude who is relatively quite active, I am on mission to improve my 10K time this year. I would like improve my lifestyle and personality. Career wise, I have chosen something unique and have faced the consequence but the hardships apart, I would think of doing anything else in my life. My simple pleasures include watching a movie late in the night, playing table tennis, going for a run while its drizzling outside and just walk outside with my earphones on. All my life I have been extremely shy, but you know I am the kind who cannot shutup if we become close. My humor is my defense mechanism and its probably the iron dome of defense mechanisms. I have referrences who can vouch for me.

What am I looking for ?

I am just here to find a partner, to chill and hangout with while I am still here. We could go for cute coffee dates, exploration outings and once you are comfortable we could go on trips. I am looking for a buddy to constantly yap about my day and listen to you do the same. Although I do not open up easily but I could give you the emotional support you need. Honestly, I know we all have our life commitments and priorities, and I respect that so you wouldn't need to worry about me being clingy. We could just keep the partnership simple to exploration, playing table tennis, going to guitar lessons, pottery classes, book clubs or simply walking in a park listening to the same music. And oh! I would die for you if you are as crazy as me for formula 1 ! Can't live without it !

So how about we start off with a cute little coffee date ! Better don't expect roses but I bet I would surprise you with something.

If you have read till here, then I would also like to mention that in the past I did get some messages and yes we are still in touch and are good friends. But as of now I am seeking for people who I can meet and interact more intimately in my life. I do not mind people from other cities texting me, I would not mind talking to you but can you please be clear with your intentions before we begin.

I live in Colorado and work for a private  Christian school as a teacher with a yearly contract that runs July through May. I also had two of my own children enrolled as students in this school. It became very evident to my husband and I that this ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù school was becoming very detrimental to the mental health of our children, and in the last month we have pulled them both from the school. Even though I no longer had my own students at the school, I was willing to work out my contract as to not put the school in a bad situation of having to fill the position mid year. My husband sent the school an email detailing the bullying our children had been victims of in the past 3 years. The email was very cut and dry, but it did point the hypocrisy of what the school claimed as their mission and what was actually happening in the building. Long story short about 20 minutes after my husband sent the email, my principal texted me and asked to me have a 1:1 meeting with her this morning. I met her at a local coffee shop where she asked me if I was planning on resigning, I told her no and she said if I did not resign my contract would be terminated effective immediately. Either option I was not allowed back to work even for the customary two weeks normally given with a resignation. I told her I would think about the ultimatum and get back to her. Shortly after I returned home I texted her back and told her I would not resign, I accept my termination and would like to have my termination in writing. 2 hours later I got texts and calls letting me know that actually I wasn‚Äôt terminated, and as long as I did not disparage the school I could come back to work Monday. My question is ‚Ä¶ do I have to accept their rescinded termination? I know that they can‚Äôt force me to come back, but would they be able to fight my claim for unemployment? I feel like my termination was retaliation to my husband‚Äôs email about our kids, and when I asked for it in writing they panicked and now are concerned I will tell the masses about all of it.

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Neville, a young journalist, stirs in his bed, the alarm blaring. He groans, checking his phone for the time. It's early, but not early enough to escape the day's grind. The TV news plays in the background, a reporter discussing the upcoming national holiday with a mix of excitement and unease.

REPORTER (V.O.)
""Good morning, London! In just a few days, we'll be celebrating the most controversial event of the year: Bully's End! The government has once again opened the gates to the abandoned town of Mercerville for those seeking retribution. Remember, participation is voluntary and heavily monitored, but the stakes are high.""

INT. NEVILLE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Neville shuffles into the kitchen, pouring himself a cup of coffee. He turns off the TV and stares out the window, lost in thought. His mind drifts to his own high school days, recalling the taunts and cruel pranks of his former tormentors.

Suddenly, a knock at the door snaps him back to reality. He frowns, not expecting company so early. He checks the peephole and sees a young woman, LUCY, with a backpack slung over her shoulder. She looks anxious, her eyes darting from side to side.

Neville opens the door cautiously. ""Can I help you?""

LUCY (nervously)
""Hi, I'm Lucy. I know this is weird, but I think you can.""

Neville squints, recognizing Lucy from his past. ""You're... Lucy Taylor, aren't you?""

LUCY (relieved)
""Yes! From Mercerville High. Do you remember me?""

Neville nods slowly, piecing the past together. ""You were... in my class.""

LUCY
""Look, I need your help. My friends and I, we're going to Mercerville. We need a journalist to tell our story.""

INT. NEVILLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Neville sits on his couch, a steaming cup of coffee in hand, as Lucy explains her situation. She reveals that she and her four friends, all survivors of severe bullying, have decided to participate in Bully's End. They want to confront their tormentors and seek closure.

LUCY (continuing)
""We know it's dangerous, but we can't just let them get away with it. Not after everything.""

Neville listens intently, his mind racing. He can't help but feel a kinship with Lucy and her quest for justice.

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

One by one, Lucy's friends arrive: SAM, a tall, muscular guy with a gentle smile; JESS, a sharp-witted goth with a penchant for photography; MIA, a tech genius with a heart of gold; and TOM, a quiet, observant young man with a dark sense of humor.

They're an eclectic group, bound by shared pain and the desire for redemption. As they introduce themselves, Neville sees the determination in their eyes, the same fire that once burned within him.

SAM
""We heard you're looking to expose the truth about Bully's End. We need you to show the world what it's really like.""

JESS
""We want to make sure people understand that this isn't just a sick game. It's about standing up to the monsters who ruined our lives.""

MIA
""And maybe, just maybe, preventing future generations from going through the same hell we did.""

TOM (softly)
""We need someone who won't judge us.""

Neville nods solemnly, setting his coffee down. ""I'll come with you.""

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

The five of them huddle around a map of Mercerville spread out on the coffee table, planning their strategy. They discuss their targets, the layout of the town, and potential escape routes. The atmosphere is tense, a mix of anticipation and fear.

NEVILLE (voiceover)
""I never thought I'd return to Mercerville, let alone with a vendetta. But standing with Lucy and her friends, I realized I had a chance to face my own demons. And maybe, just maybe, help them slay theirs.""

The TV in the background flickers with images of the abandoned town being prepared for the event. The reporter's voice is muffled, but the excitement is palpable.

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The group has gathered their supplies: makeshift weapons, cameras, and a determination that borders on obsession. They sit in silence, each lost in their own thoughts.

LUCY
""Thank you, Neville. For believing us.""

Neville smiles, patting her on the shoulder. ""It's time we all face our pasts.""

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Neville packs his bag, glancing at an old photo of himself and Lucy from high school. He takes a deep breath and tucks it safely inside, a silent promise to tell their story.

FADE OUT.

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

The group gathers their gear, checking and re-checking their supplies. The door opens, and a gust of wind whips through the room, carrying the distant sound of carnival music.

Neville looks at Lucy, his resolve firm. ""Ready?""

LUCY (nods)
""Let's do this.""

They pile into an old, reliable van, the kind that's seen better days. The engine roars to life, and Neville adjusts his camera gear in the passenger seat. The group exchanges nervous glances in the rearview mirror as they pull out of the city, heading towards the desolate stretch of road that leads to Mercerville.

INT. VAN - EN ROUTE TO MERCERVILLE - DAY

The van rumbles along the deserted highway, the sun casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt. Lucy sits in the back, her hand tightly clutching a crumpled note.

LUCY (voiceover)
""This was the last thing he ever said to me before he left. 'You're worthless. You'll never amount to anything.'""

JESS (reaches over, squeezes Lucy's shoulder)
""You're not worthless, Luce. You're here with us now.""

SAM
""And we're going to show him just how wrong he was.""

The conversation lulls, the tension thickening like the dust kicked up by the van's tires.

INT. VAN - NEARING MERCERVILLE - DAY

The towering gates of Mercerville come into view, adorned with a grotesque welcome sign for the 'Bully's End Festival'. The music grows louder, a cacophony of laughter and screams echoing through the speakers.

NEVILLE
""Alright, everyone. When we go in, stay together and keep your cameras rolling. We want to capture every moment.""

They nod in unison, a mix of excitement and fear painted on their faces.

INT. MERCERVILLE TOWN SQUARE - DAY

The van parks among a sea of vehicles. The town square is a macabre sight, transformed into a twisted festival ground with food stalls, games, and a central stage where a MC announces the rules of engagement.

MC (over loudspeaker)
""Welcome to Bully's End! Remember, no firearms, no explosives, and no killing outside the designated areas. Safety is our number one priority!""

The group exits the van, the sound of their footsteps lost in the din of the crowd.

MIA
""This is insane.""

TOM
""This is our chance.""

They weave through the throngs of people, their eyes scanning for familiar faces.

INT. MERCERVILLE - ABANDONED SCHOOL - DAY

Neville and Lucy enter the school, the setting for so much of their pain. Graffiti covers the walls, a testament to the anger and resentment that fuels this holiday.

LUCY
""This is where it all started for me. The hallways, the classrooms... they're like battlefields.""

They split up to cover more ground, promising to stick to the plan.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Neville's camera captures the eerie silence of the school, the only sound their echoing footsteps. Suddenly, a shadowy figure emerges from a classroom.

NEVILLE (whispers)
""Got you.""

He approaches, the camera's red light blinking. The figure steps into the light, revealing a bruised and bloodied man, his eyes wide with terror.

VICTIM (pleading)
""Please, I didn't do anything!""

Neville's heart sinks as he realizes the man isn't their target, but a participant who's been on the receiving end of the game's brutality.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

The group reassembles, sharing their initial findings. The tension is palpable as they discuss the reality of the event versus the sanitized version presented by the media.

JESS
""This is worse than I thought.""

SAM
""We can't back out now. We've come too far.""

Neville nods, his jaw set. ""We'll stick to the story. Just remember why we're here.""

INT. ABANDONED S

NEVILLE
""We need to find a safe spot to regroup.""

They move through the school, the air thick with anticipation and dread. Neville's hand brushes against something cold and metallic in his pocket - the knife he'd brought for protection. He grips it tightly, feeling its weight and the sharpness of its blade.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

The group huddles in a corner, the distant sounds of chaos a stark contrast to their hushed whispers. Neville pulls out the knife, and the others exchange nervous glances.

SAM
""What's that for?""

NEVILLE (determined)
""Insurance. And a reminder of what we're capable of if we need to protect ourselves.""

JESS (swallows hard)
""Let's just stick to the plan. We're here to expose the truth, not become part of the problem.""

They agree, tucking away their weapons for now. They split up again, each with a clear objective to find their bullies.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY

Neville searches the dusty library, the shelves lined with books that seem to watch him with judgmental eyes. His heart races as he spots a familiar face in the corner, shrouded in shadows.

NEVILLE (whispers to himself)
""It's him.""

He approaches, camera at the ready. The figure slowly stands, revealing NEIL, Neville's own high school tormentor.

NEIL (sneers)
""Well, well. If it isn't the little tattletale himself.""

Neville's hand shakes, but he keeps the camera steady. ""You know why I'm here.""

NEIL
""Oh, I know. But you're too late. I've moved on.""

Neville's anger boils over. ""You can't just move on from what you've done!""

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Neil laughs, a cold, hollow sound that sends shivers down Neville's spine. ""Or maybe you're just not as strong as you think you are.""

Neville's grip tightens on the knife, his thumb flipping the safety off with a sharp click. ""We'll see about that.""

The tension builds as the two men circle each other, the air charged with unspoken threats.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Suddenly, a crash echoes through the library. The group rushes in, alerted by the sound. They see Neville and Neil locked in a tense standoff.

LUCY (shocked)
""Neville, no!""

Neville's eyes dart to Lucy, then back to Neil. He takes a deep breath, sliding the knife back into his pocket. ""You're right. I'm not here to become one of you.""

He turns and leaves the library, the camera still rolling.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - HALLS - CONTINUOUS

The group regroups, their mission clearer than ever. They encounter other participants and survivors, some seeking revenge, others seeking peace. Each story they hear strengthens their resolve to expose the truth of Bully's End.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - ROOFTOP - DAY

They climb to the rooftop, overlooking the town. From here, they can see the chaos unfolding below. The group shares their most painful memories, their voices cracking with emotion.

LUCY
""I just want to tell him that I'm not the weak girl he left behind.""

SAM
""We all have our demons to face.""

JESS
""And we'll face them together.""

They hug, a silent promise to support each other.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

Neville's camera captures the panoramic view of Mercerville, the sun setting over the chaos below. His hand shakes as he pulls out the knife again, this time with a newfound sense of purpose.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

The group's faces are etched with a mix of determination and doubt. Neville breaks the silence.

NEVILLE
""We're not just here for closure. We're here to stop this from happening to anyone else.""

SAM (nods)
""We need to show the world that this isn't a solution. It's just more violence.""

They spot a group of frat boys, led by LEVI, the notorious ringleader of their own high school bullies. The sight of them sends a chill down their spines.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

Levi and his crew strut through the schoolyard, laughing and taunting other participants. Neville's hand tightens around the knife, his eyes locked on the man who had once ruled their school with fear.

LUCY (whispers)
""That's him. That's the one who did the most damage.""

Neville nods, his jaw clenched. ""We're going to get him.""

They devise a plan, using the shadows to their advantage.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The school is plunged into darkness as the lights flicker and die. The group moves stealthily through the corridors, their breathing the only sound. They spot Levi and his entourage heading towards the gym, where the final confrontations are rumored to take place.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYM - CONTINUOUS

The gym is a battleground, the air thick with the scent of fear and sweat. Neville's heart races as he spots Levi, now armed with a bat.

SAM (whispers)
""We need to split up. Distract him. Give Neville a clear shot.""

The group nods, moving into position.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYM - CONTINUOUS

Neville approaches Levi from behind, the knife gleaming in his hand. The camera is rolling, capturing every step.

LEVI (turns, sees Neville)
""What the f**k do you think you're doing, you little b**tch?""

Neville's hand shakes as he raises the knife, but Lucy's voice pierces the air.

LUCY (from the shadows)
""We're not here to play your games.""

Levi sneers, turning to face Lucy. ""You always were the brave one.""

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYM - CONTINUOUS

The tension builds as the group confronts Levi and his crew. The camera captures every word, every flinch.

LUCY
""You don't get to do this anymore.""

Levi swings the bat at Lucy, but Neville steps in, the knife flashing in the dim light.

NEVILLE
""This ends now!""

With a swift motion, Neville stabs Levi in the neck, the blade sinking deep. Levi's eyes widen in shock and pain before he crumples to the ground. The frat boys scatter, leaving their leader to bleed out.

INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYM - CONTINUOUS

The group stands over Levi's body, the gravity of their actions setting in.

JESS (horrified)
""Oh my God...what have we done?""

Neville stares at the blood on his hands, the camera still rolling. ""This isn't justice. This is just more of the same.""

SAM (placing a hand on Neville's shoulder)
""We've got the proof we need. We show the world what Bully's End really is.""

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

The group sits in Neville's living room, the footage from their trip playing on the TV. They've decided to use it to create a documentary, to show the world the horrors of Bully's End. The images of Levi's lifeless body are a stark reminder of the power of their actions.

NEVILLE
""We can't just let this happen every year.""

SAM
""We have to get this out there.""

JESS
""But what about the others we couldn't save?""

""We honor them by making sure their stories aren't forgotten.""

They spend the next few days editing the footage, their conversations a mix of anger and sorrow. The town's dark secrets unfold before their eyes, each frame a testament to the cycle of violence they've lived through.

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Neville sits at his computer, the final edits of the documentary playing. The moment where he stabs Levi is replayed, the sound of the knife piercing flesh haunts the room.

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

Neville lies awake, the images of the night replaying in his mind. He can still feel the knife in his hand, the hot blood spurting from Levi's neck. He wipes the cold sweat from his brow.

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

The group gathers around the TV, ready to watch the final cut. The documentary opens with the chilling announcement of the holiday, and as the story unfolds, their journey through Mercerville is revealed in raw, unfiltered detail.

INT. NEVILLE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The moment of the confrontation with Levi and his crew is intense. The sound of the knife being drawn and the thud of the gunshot echo through the room. The camera shakes as Neville stabs Levi in the neck, and a split second later, fires a shot into the head of Frat boy Rat. Justin, another bully, drops to the ground, lifeless.

The room falls silent, the weight of their actions hanging heavy in the air. Lucy's hand trembles as she clutches a small knife, the same one Neville had used in the schoolyard. The cold, metallic glint reflects the stark reality of the situation.",0,1729999220.0,horror,0,0.5,False

1gd1wxy,https://i.redd.it/dxddo6xdv7xd1.jpeg,"Found out my boyfriend cheated on me last October, stayed","Bit of a long post. Sorry.
Last October I had serious suspicions- due to a lot of evidence- that my boyfriend, of 2 years, was cheating on me, while I was working away (1 week on, 3-4 weeks off, making big bucks for us) I asked him when I came home, he admitted he went out drinking with his friends and took a girl back to his car. I already made the decision on my week at work (which I cut short to come home cause I was physically sick thinking/knowing in my heart what he had done) that I was going to forgive him if we could work through it together, being open and honest and make efforts towards rebuilding trust. Hell,  even though I've never cheated on him, I've done my fair share of being a piece of s**t person in my past, I know people make mistakes, we are all human. I love this man. And although it was a really hard thing to move passed, we kind of did it. The suspisions came up again this March. And I hate myself for it, but I looked through his email. I found emails from a dating app in his deleted folder, an email confirmation and then a promotional type of email. I asked him about it, with a thorough explanation about how crazy I felt about going through his email, and that I did not want to cause a fight, I just needed an explanation. He chalked it up to spam, when I asked why he deleted it, when he never deletes emails, he said he didn't want me to worry.
Fast forward to now, he's on a trip overseas with his two brothers. This infidelity thing has been on my mind like crazy. I was petrified leading up to this trip, that he was going to cheat on me while he was gone. He got a little distant over whatsapp,  and then there was a couple times he couldn't call me because of the time difference and stuff, and I got very upset. 
A little more backstory about me.. I have borderline personality disorder,  clinical depression, adhd, and difficult past trauma that has been hard to face and work through. I started my personal mental health and therapy journey in 2018, it's been long and very trying. I'm on medication, and I go to therapy. I feel I've made a lot of improvements, but if I'm ever in severe emotional distress, these past tendencies can come through. I absolutely hate myself whenever it happens, even though it's not frequent, it just feels like all the work I've done is meaningless and my world just crumbles around me, I feel like a completely different person. I hate it. It's also been an annoying, but fair, thing that gets brought up by people that know me personally. ""I've had a tendency to be irrational, so I'm probably just being irrational"". So I try to avoid any confrontation with people I love, for fear of it just being summed up as another time I'm being ""crazy"".
ANYWAY, I'm here alone while boyfriend is being distant in a far away place, and I get really depressed and I (definitely unfairly) lashed out, saying it was not right for him not to message me before he went to bed and when he woke up (like we agreed we would, mostly to make sure we're still alive, but also to give me a sense of normality while he's away). And although it was a lengthy conversation,  I was left feeling like, ""well I'm just being irrational again, for no reason, I am crazy, and I need to lay off and let him have fun with his brothers in a new country. Just chill"".
Today- even though things have simmered, I've apologized, and called my doctor to up my meds and got into a new group therapy as well as some other online therapies, so I can be more prepared for when I slip- I could not get through this paranoia again. I check his email. In his deleted file is an email saying he has deleted an account on a dating app. In the email it says you can recover the acount. I do it. I see he's made an account for himself, with his location as where he is overseas. He uploaded three pictures.  Two of them with our cats, the cats I had before I even met him. I could not see if he messaged or liked anyone. Not sure if he deleted them, or if he just uploaded the app In a rage while we were fighting, then deleted it when we made up. I honestly have no idea what to do. This has taken me so long to write since I can't stop shaking, I'm physically sick. When I seen the email and opened the profile, I just straight up sat there for fifteen minutes disassociate and vibrating. When I came back to reality,  I had to run to the washroom before I threw up all overthe keyboard. 
I don't know what to think and what to do. Why am I doing this? Am I just completely crazy? Why am I here? Why am I still here?
...
Coffee i got delivered, vape, my favorite chocolate bar. Can't eat the chocolate bar, I had one bite and threw up again. I shouldn't even have coffee, the adhd medication I got on to make myself a better person, for this relationship (ya know, because I'm crazy) mixed with caffeine really messes me up. But I used to love coffee. Now everything just tastes like garbage. ",11,1729999051.0,depressionmeals,7,0.87,False

Johnson Street NE and 35W Ramp Intersection - Project Update 10/25","The City of Minneapolis is reconstructing Johnson Street NE between the 35W Ramps and 18h Ave NE. The project includes:

* Removal of the existing street
* Utility and signal upgrades
* New pavement, curb and gutter, sidewalks
* ADA pedestrian ramps, signs and pavement marking
* Off road bike lanes on the west side of the street
* Green Stormwater Infrastructure

# Latest project news

**Construction update**

Construction continues on the southbound side of Johnson Street south of 18th Ave, as well as the westerly leg of the Johnson Street SE/Quarry Drive/35W Ramp intersection. Storm sewer work and the watermain repair¬†work was completed this past week along with preparation of the gravel base for the roadway.

[Installing the storm sewer pipes and catchbasins along the west side of Johnson Street NE.](https://preview.redd.it/5p8a1yzxu7xd1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bae4995959be546dbdf8700021517fab343056c8)

# What's coming up

* We will be finishing up the grading at the intersection as we prepare to place the concrete sidewalks and curb.
* We expect to pave the first layer of asphalt late next week followed by some of the concrete work (sidewalk/bike path/curbs).
* Additional electrical work will continue for the new lighting system, the new traffic signal and revisions to the traffic signal at 18th.¬†
* Note that the contractor has applied for after-hours work (after 6pm M-F) to take advantage of the daylight remaining and the great weather we have had. While they may not be working late every day, it is likely they will work late on most days.

# Traffic impacts

**Traffic impacts ‚Äì See map below for the detour routes that are now in use for the remainder of the project. We have made some adjustments to the signal timing at the intersection of New Brighton Boulevard/Stinson Boulevard to help reduce delays for eastbound traffic on 18th Avenue. We continue to monitor the situation.**

**Pedestrians - Note that the route to/from The Quarry has changed - please follow the signed pedestrian route.**

When children are involved, you need to do better and I genuinely never understood how she didn‚Äôt protecting their children . Like I know she was scared and for good reason but when he beat on their children, would that not be a breaking point?

It actually breaks my heart to think of Marie‚Äôs first violent encounter with who Teddy truly is. She must‚Äôve been so frightened and confused because like she said, Teddy didn‚Äôt start out like that. And also, I know she got a lot of flack for it and understandably, but what she did when it came to Johnny and Aoife, was understandable from her pov. They both raised her concerns of carrying the same cycle in their own ways: Johnny & Shan sharing similarities of how her & Teddy‚Äôs relationship began and Joey and Aoife having the pregnancy but Joey also reminding her of Teddy.

It‚Äôs incredibly complex the way her children felt about her. They loved and hated her because she was a victim and a villain.

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall and spooky season.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to stay active, and exercise daily. [This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/h0HFFpQ)

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+. Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something super serious, nor am I looking to relocate or anything like that.

Every post I see asking for recommendations for a pod coffee machine gets no real answers and like 999 people saying ""pods suck just do drips instead"". 
I hear you. But I reeeeally need actual recommendations.

Ideally I need one that does both pods and drips. But one that only does pods works too, if it accepts dupes n cups.
It would also be nice for it to have a self cleaning system of sorts.

For years now, I have been working two jobs to buy a home.  I've been spending a lot of time advancing my career to put myself in a comfortable position financially.  I always made time for him though, planning little trips.  Writing cute notes, cooking him meals.  I feel like I was a great partner up until the very end.  The relationship was very loving and likely the first healthy relationship I've ever been in.  He was incredibly loyal to me, he thought the world of me.  I wish he loved himself the way he loved me.  There was no betrayal, no love lost.

Initially, marriage/motherhood were not things I wanted in life.  When I entered the relationship, this was my stance.  He was working at a coffee shop and living a very peaceful life with zero plans for the future.  I communicated my change of heart in Year 2 of our relationship, thinking that he would be happy as I know he wanted these things too.  I was ready for that next step, after spending 5 years single, becoming the best version of myself.

I really matured over the 4 years we were together.  And, he didnt.  After a while, I grew resentful of his stagnant life even though these were the terms I entered the relationship with.  WHY OH WHY did I think anything was going to change?!?!? I became the naggy girlfriend like ""when are you gunna do this?"" and I started not believing what he was telling me anymore (ex: I promise I will change, I promise I will get a better job).  I started hating who I was becoming in the relationship too, I started putting him down.  I was losing respect for him.  How can you watch me work my ass off while you do nothing to carry this load with me?  I know he loved me, but a part of me thinks he loved what I could provide for him.

We were both on two totally different paths and I think we, both, needed to find someone better suited for those paths.  I wish I could just accept him for who he was, but there was too much I wanted to change.  I never thought I'd be the chick with arbitrary timelines but I became one of those lol... I was so tired of waiting.  And, I know it wasnt fair to put that pressure on him when he wasnt ready for it.",2,1729997223.0,BreakUps30Plus,0,1.0,False

1gd1dlk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gd1dlk,Hey I'm Brett.,"34 and living alone in Rochester since 2019. I'm from Florida originally but have moved around a lot including overseas, most recently I moved from Texas to start over shortly after COVID happened so that shut me down socially for a while along with focusing on building my life up again. I like where I'm at now and have been feeling more adjusted here. I'm  here as a parent to my 17y.o daughter and she's been a big part of my life,  she lives with her mom here and she's been my main attachment to Rochester since 2008.  I'm involved with my daughter's life regularly and on good terms with my kids mom. I also have my cat and dog here that I'm a full-time parent for.. Buddy is my dog and Lucas is the cat, they keep me company and are the best thing in my life on a daily basis. I have a lot of indoor hobbies like games and YouTube but I've also been creating a schedule for myself outside of my apartment at the gym and coffee shops nearby. I would like to meet someone that is interested in getting to know me and to get out and explore Rochester with them. I'm visually impaired and live on social security income while supplementing that income with full-time plasma donations and I'm making the most out of that for myself. I have a long history of labor work and some retail and restaurant jobs.. I've also attempted college for some time.. I'm getting by now but have a history of wanting more for myself. I'm easy to talk to and look forward to someone seeing this. ",2,1729997147.0,RochesterNYDating,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôd def encourage folks to try even if it‚Äôs just a coffee and a baked good. The $22 cake slices are absolutely enough for 3 adults with a sweet tooth and would be great for a little sweet treat for a family of 4-6 if everyone wants a few bites.",88,1729996982.0,WaltDisneyWorld,36,0.83,False
1gd1boz,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1gd1boz/not_on_my_wet_wipes/,NOT ON MY WET WIPES!!!,"Hey guys,

LET ME START BY saying,

I (M,30)  just arrived back for six hours of work at my apartment, which I share with my female roommate (34-35?). We get along‚Ä¶ sometimes. But definitely not lately. I prepare my dinner, enjoy some coffee with milk. Then the inevitable happens‚Äînature calls, and I have to pee. I go and sit on the throne, some folks may say. I scan the surroundings as nature takes its flow: some hairs, a clean mirror, a yellowing plant, what? - a wet toilette paper role, a badly cleaned blood stain. Wait... and on my wet wipes (of course we don‚Äôt share wet wipes; I have my cheap ‚Äúmanly‚Äù ones, and she has hers). Well, on mine, there‚Äôs a strange object, see picture if you please. It seems to be toilet paper rolled around something, covered in blood. Is there a tampon inside? A dead animal? I don‚Äôt know, and I won‚Äôt venture to ask. My roommate is in her room or out. I don‚Äôt want to talk about it now, so I go to my room, chat with a friend, but nature calls again. I see the bloody object again. And it doesn‚Äôt leave my brain for hours. I do what any other person would do‚Äîopen Google and consult ChatGPT. I start to write a small letter to share my complaints with the creator of that masterpiece, supervised by my new companion Chati PiTi, and after an hour, I‚Äôm done with it. I‚Äôm satisfied with it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I started out quite passive-aggressive‚Äînot intentionally, but again, nature takes its flow. My supervisor Chati PiTi tamed me, and I bit back; supervisors always win unless you quit. So here I am with the draft. My question is, is my letter, aka WhatsApp message, too much? Am I the asshole roommate?

For additional info:  
We get along sometimes, but in the last three months, things have been tense! It would take a few other posts to explain. We have some clear, explicit rules for the bathroom. Last year, after living together for a while, she asked how I pee. I said normally, standing. She asked if I could sit instead. I agreed and said, yeah, klaro! The next ten days, more or less, she asked me at least once daily how I was peeing. On about day 10, she asks, ‚ÄúHOW DID YOU PEE TODAY?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúPretty good!‚Äù No, just kidding‚ÄîI said, ‚ÄúYeah, sometimes sitting, sometimes standing.‚Äù She screams without screaming; you know what I mean. Then she blurts something like, it‚Äôs unhygienic (true, I agree) and that I promised something (I‚Äôm pretty sure I said I‚Äôd *try*, since I don‚Äôt like to make absolute promises‚Äîmakes it easier to break them; call it scoundrel wisdom) and that trust was lost or something along those lines. Maybe I‚Äôm exaggerating, but something tells me I‚Äôm not. I felt attacked, so I countered with the period stains in the bathroom, pointing out that it was also unhygienic and that I was trying to break a habit of 29 years, so it was hard to remember what the body has automated. Plus, it was humiliating to be asked daily how I peed. We kind of went on with our lives after that. I now pee seated, ALWAYS‚Äîexcept in restaurants with male urinals, which makes me feel dignified and adds to the experience of going out. My little secret between me and the public toilets. Well, strange turn. So, here‚Äôs the point: I was offended and felt like she was in the wrong. But what‚Äôs wrong and right‚Äîam I right?

Anyway, with that context, here‚Äôs the Frankenletter, created with love by me and ChatGPT:

\*Hi, sorry to bring up such an uncomfortable topic. I know you‚Äôre super busy, but over the last three months, I‚Äôve occasionally noticed blood stains in the bathroom‚Äîon the toilet or even sometimes on the sofa blanket in the kitchen. I understand that this can happen to anyone, and I don‚Äôt mean to judge. However, finding used toilet paper with blood on my wet wipes today was a bit unsettling for me.

We‚Äôve talked before about hygiene and being considerate of each other in the bathroom. When we had the conversation last year about urinating, we agreed that I would sit rather than stand. I respect your preferences and always sit to urinate, as we discussed. I would appreciate it if you could also respect my needs so that we can maintain a good level of trust day-to-day and avoid any awkward conversations or questions about each other's habits.

I understand that sometimes things slip one‚Äôs mind‚ÄîI totally get that! Since this is the first time something like this has happened, I hope it was just an oversight and doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre dealing with any health issues. I would just like to ask that personal hygiene items be disposed of in a way that keeps our shared things, or each other‚Äôs belongings, clean.

As I said, I know you‚Äôre very busy, and I don‚Äôt want to intrude, but it was important for me to bring up this topic. I would just appreciate if situations like this could be avoided in the future. If you‚Äôd like to discuss it, I‚Äôm open to it, though for me, it‚Äôs not strictly necessary. No bad blood on my side, pun intended. I hope not on yours too.\*

Let me know if you‚Äôd suggest any changes!

Additional info:  
We‚Äôve barely spoken in the last two months, partly because we‚Äôre really busy, but also because I feel like I‚Äôm avoiding her. She tends to turn our conversations toward her life choices‚Äîwhat she should say to her professor, if she should go to a meeting that was already canceled, how she can get a supervisor, or how she can use ChatGPT for that. It feels like I‚Äôm her ChatGPT, and she doesn‚Äôt really care about me personally. When she asks about my day, I sometimes feel like she‚Äôs expecting me to entertain her. So, I‚Äôve been keeping my distance, which has actually been healthier.

I need to live with her‚Äîwhy? Because she‚Äôs my black cat Dorothy! Sadly, that‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôm just broke and don‚Äôt have time to find a new apartment or move. What do you think, people?

Is my text too much? Is my apartment going to be in flames this weekend? Am I the asshole, or should I just place the bloody tissue on her toilet paper and forget about it?

I don‚Äôt think my roommate is a bad person, but I believe she can easily take advantage of others and doesn‚Äôt think twice about her behavior‚Äîsome kind of emotional blindness. She did help me out by letting me live with her two years ago, and about 18 months ago, I was paying rent really late, sometimes even a month or 45 days overdue. I‚Äôve tried to correct my ways, and I pay on time now, with only slight delays sometimes. But‚Ä¶ there are other issues in daily life that also make me hesitate about sending the message. There are too many to go over now, but they deserve their own posts‚Äîlike not giving me a key for the mailbox. I don‚Äôt know if she was joking when she said she doesn‚Äôt want me to see her mail, but after two years, I still don‚Äôt have a key. Hope dies last, I guess.

Well, guys, this is my first post‚Äîfeeling lucky. ChatGPT also checked this text but took a bit too many poetic liberties, so I had to tame it. The child is wild.

I've been working as a waiter at this new place for about a month, and it's much better than the other jobs I've had as a waiter, and better paid too... 

And yet, every day I feel like this job requires to put aside any self respect that I have. Customers treat me like a monkey. Yesterday a customer yelled at me because I told her I needed to check with the kitchen if we could make her a coffee that wasn't contaminated with gluten (we aren't a gluten free restaurant or anything). She said I should be ashamed to show up for work if I can't answer questions without checking with the kitchen. Today I got scolded by the owner for being FOUR minutes late when I regularly work over time since I'm always closing. And this is the best job I've had as a student. 

I don't know what to do, I'm really tired. I love what I study but lately I'm wondering if this is all worth it. I'm tired of switching jobs because I can never find one that actually schedules the hours promised and that doesn't make me feel like death. I don't understand how everyone does it, I put so much effort into what I do and it never feels like it's enough. How does everyone manage to keep showing up for their job?

My coworker grabbed me by my jacket, began shaking me, and said ‚ÄúX, you have to do something!‚Äù I said ‚ÄúWell what do you want me to do?‚Äù to which he proposed I should run out there, lift her off the ground, and carry her to safety.

Joseph Bl_____ (leaving out last name just in case it‚Äôs legit)
Regional corporate finance 
Wireless call 

- Called around 9:10pm 
- Asked shift lead her name and age 
- At first asked for a manager
- Said this was a third party audit brought on by store owner
- Said we had counterfeit money in deposits 
- Asking about our deposits 
- Said we needed to make a deposit at Walgreens 
- Asked for a walk through our deposit process 
- Wanted to know how much was in our deposit 
- When told that they were told by management to hang up, guy got upset and told them ‚Äúthat it wasn‚Äôt managements place to decide that‚Äù 
- Said team of three people would be there by 8am to do the audit bc they didn‚Äôt do it over the phone

Luckily they were smart and hung up once he got to the deposit part, but by this point I‚Äôm pretty sure they gave some information about the amount of money that we might have or our deposits in general - but my workers did not disclose what exactly the guy might know.

This is most definitely a scam right? My workers let me know that he was pretty upset that they were involving me - so should I actually be worried about people showing up to rob us in the morning? I will be at my store early in the morning so I‚Äôm trying to take some precautions :/

Actually, he doesn‚Äôt like to be on his back at all. If I even set him down for a minute to put the carrier on or to grab something from the kitchen he screams. If I try to put him down when he‚Äôs asleep he instantly wakes up and screams. He will sleep 10-12 hours through the night but only if you are holding him. He will wake up periodically and fuss but typically goes back to sleep. Wakes up once or twice for a quick feed. But if I put him down the hour+ long cycle of trying to put him back to sleep begins again because he is awake just screaming until he‚Äôs red in the face. He started teething just shy of turning 3 months and it has made things worse. He is miserable 90% of the time. He hates his play mat, his swing, the car, going for walks. He just cries the entire time. He naps like shit. 20 minutes maybe 2-3 times a day. I try to Bf but he eats so much I don‚Äôt produce enough so we supplement with formula as well. When I BF he just latches and unlatches 50+ times a feed to the point my nipples are raw.

(They have changed some things up, but not really.)

Once you arrive at the DELTA campus you'll be directed from the security officers booth to a small lobby and retrieve your name badge and given directions to the building where the day will begin.

You'll wait in the lobby until your host arrives to great you and give you information on the day and try to sell why DELTA is this magnificent company to work for. (Subjective \*\*GOOGLE IT\*\*)

Here you'll see a number of candidates from around the nation just like you.

\- Produce 2 forms of I.D

\- Receive a ZONE (1,2, or 3) - (don't get nervous on placement, this is for organization)

You'll be escorted upstairs where you can leave your luggage and you'll be told to leave everything in that room, (phones, resumes, workbooks, etc.)

Once upstairs you'll be greeted by 20+ current flight attendants clapping and cheering you on (AS IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THE POSITION) (You DIDN'T so do not be fooled by this marketing tactic)

Once your belongings and secured you'll be seated by your zones and they will begin telling you about the day.

This is where the fun begins :-)

**Zone 1 will go and complete the 1 on 1 interview first. (You will sit with a current FA and a talent req representative and go over basic STAR questions.)**

**\*\*\* NOOBS: S-Situation | T-Task | A-Action| R-Result (What happened, what was the task, what action did you take and what was the result... Make sure you actions provided a positive result)\*\*\***

They'll talk about themselves for a sec then a little about you....

I do not remember all of the questions but TWO of them for sure is:

1. Tell be about a time you had to work with a co worker with a difficult personality
2. Let's say LAX is where you are assigned. What would that look like for you?

THEY WILL ASK YOU THREE QUESTIONS.

NEXT THEY WILL DO A ROLL PLAY WITH YOU AND THE FA WHERE YOU ARE THE ""PRETEND FA"" AND THEY ARE THE PASSENGER AND THERE IS NO OVERHEAD-BIN SPACE AND YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE THEM AND LET THEM KNOW THEY HAVE TO CHECK THERE BAG.

**ZONE 2 will be conducting the ""REACH TEST""**

You'll be asked to remove your shoes (Wear clean socks) and reach with both hands to see if you are able to close the overhead bins. (If you are vertically challenged don't be discouraged, have you ever seen a 6'8 FA? Yeah me neither) Then you'll be asked to sit in a jump-seat and put the seatbelts and place your hands on your knees while you sit.

BUT DON'T BE FOOLED MY GOOD FRIENDS this ""test"" is to see you have visible tattoos on your hands fingers, wrists, etc... while you perform those tasks. this ""test"" is no more then 1 minute long

If you have any TATS...PLEASE PUT ON MAKE UP Or something to cover them. no matter where they are!!!! \*\*Even though yes I have photos of current DELTA FA's with hand, finger, neck, behind ear tats...\*\* contradiction much

**ZONE 3 will be conducting the team exercise (This is where they changed somethings up, ill explain towards the end in case they try to switch it up AGAIN :-) )**

Here you'll team up with 2 other candidates where you have to decide between say 20 issues from most important to least important and place them on a board 1-10

You'll have a ""mingle"" session where they'll tell you to walk around meet and greet blah blah. (they are killing time)

(They are deliberating on who they are keeping and who they are sending home)

Last you'll all be sitting down where they begin to tell you more about the position AS IF YOU ALL GOT THE JOB! Please do not fall for that. They will go over several hot topics like where you'll be based scheduling and pay which is the following:

1. During training in ATL is $7/HR \*\*lol i know\*\* (you will have a room-ate at a hotel during training and be provided meals throughout your training) upon graduation it will start at $35/hr.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*35/HR FLIGHT TIME is when you are paid\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

ie: during boarding you're paid $2 until you depart and take off, that is when your $35/HR Begins.

IE: You have 4 legs (flights) today. Once you get to the airport for your sign in time for say 5am for a 6am departure you are not getting paid your $35/HR until you take off and when you land and get to the gate.  At that time your back to your 2 dollars. So while you're helping passengers board, helping with bags, assisting with needs both pre departure and arrival its 2 bucks....(if you have a 2-3 hour sit time at the next city until your next flight you're being paid your $2 dollars. Rinse and repeat

ALL DAY LONG YOU'LL HERE DELTA MONITORS EVERYTHING DO NOT SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS OR ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT ALL THAT WENT ON

THEY WILL CALL YOUR NAMES ONE BY ONE ACCORDING TO THE ZONES 1,2, AND 3

If you are called you DID NOT GET THE POSITION!!!

You'll grab your things and are escorted out the building to the airport or wherever you came from

when they say PLEASE LOOK OUT FOR YOUR EMAILS  do not fall for that you DID NOT get the position

(they will say this several times)

Once all of us common folks are escorted out those that remained after all the zones were called, are the ones that are given the CJO- Drug test and background!!!!!! (When you are being walked out the will try and shade and cover who is left with there bodies...\* for conflict prevention reasons (HOW THIS MF make it etccc)\*

I will say this class had so much great talent and they passed on them all. ALL EXCEPT 3/30 of us. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE AIRLINES EXPERIENCE NOR DO YOU HAVE TO BE SOME PERFECT ROBOT during this event. Those are people eyeballing you as if you're some fish in the barrel do not be intimidated, be your self and give it your best shot. IT IS A POPULARITY CONTEST- It has very little to do with where you are currently, (My class had 10+ current FA's, only one who I adored got through).

I've done this FOUR TIMES, Think about it Ive had to apply, virtual interview and make it to ATL 4 times. How is it that not once that I have received any offer. (Some will say ""yeahh i got it on my 10th try""- BRUH WHAT)

LASTLY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GET DISCOURAGED IF YOU ARE NOT SELECTED. DELTA IS ONE FISH IN THE OCEAN. AMERICAN/UNITED/SOUTHWEST are also great companies to join as an FA with WAYYYYYYY better flight benefits\*\*\* GOOGLE IT\*\* (Which is why we obviously initially apply).... Anywho I am current in the business and have plenty of info if needed....let me know.

Good luck peeps....

Team exercise CART

If they decide to do the CART test you will team up the same 3-4 candidates and have to ""build the cart"" with the provided info given on a sheet.

SERVICE & TRANSITIONS -- üëç good  
Slow checkin but the woman working here seemed friendly.¬† 
Not friendly enough for a $30 early checkin fee, but friendly...  
MVP employees: N/A  

ROOM \[[guest room](https://youtu.be/GjHYLg-iMWQ)\] -- üëé poor¬†  
FYI: Motel room -- NOT a hotel. Set expectations accordingly for accommodations.  
Very few positives other than the immense amount of storage.  
negatives:  
Not pretty; felt like a partial renovation.  
""Dingy""; no dusting or deep carpet cleaning.  
Pests ü¶ü.  
Poor lighting.  

BED [King] -- üëç¬† good  
Not amazing but surprisingly good considering the state of everything else.
Strong mattress.  
Decent pillow build.  
Comfortable sheets.¬† 
Got good sleep when the other guests weren't talking at their normal volume...  

BATH -- üëé poor  
I liked the physical, semi-spacious, dimensions of this areas. Cosmetically it was still an eyesore; very worn.  
Some things were new, others were dreary. The budget felt strange...:¬† a beautiful contemporary wash basin, complimented by cheap soap dispensers falling off the wall.  
The Mystery Soap doesn't lather easily & housekeeping didn't replace toiletries consistently. Just bring a Beauty Bar.  
Fair water pressure & hot temps nearly redeemed the shower experience until I saw how small & dirty the towels were ü§¢.  

TV/ENT./ACTIVITIES -- üëé poor  
BIG big TV -- in fact, it's too big for this room. There's a lack of air flow with this installation, generating a lot of heat.  
Cable services periodically drop & the remote buttons rarely register when pressed. Although there are thousands of channels, they were ultimately a chore to navigate.  

WI-FI & CELL RECEPTION -- üëé poor  
Free, unencrypted, & performs in the expected range for a budget stay. It's poorly tuned, but no packet loss experienced.  
--Performance--  
Video streaming - bad   
Online gaming - poor   
Video chatting - poor  
--Nerd Stats--  
4-11 Mbps download  
1-11 Mbps upload  
0% packet loss  
42 ms latency  
97 ms jitter  

FOOD & DRINK -- üëç¬† ok  
The size & design (faux vintage) of the mini fridge was appealing.¬† 
They didn't 'splurge' as much on the microwave, but it was functional & both appliances were clean.  
Vending machines & ice are accessible from the parking lot.  
in-room:  
‚úÖmicrowave (mini)  
‚úÖmini-fridge (large)  
‚úÖcoffee/tea  
‚ùå wet-bar  
‚ùå mini-bar  

NOISE --  üëé  poor. 
Hope for an upper floor because acoustic are a dead. You can hear everything on the other side of these weak doors.  

LOCATION --  üëç ok.  
In true motel fashion, we're on the side of the road. Functionally not a lot going on in this department.  

RECOMMENDATION  
Final Price: $127.83  
Was it worth it? No.  
Best part:¬†fridge  
It's hard to find a clean, pest-free, motel in SoCal, and this one was no different. On that note, It's also misrepresented as a hotel.  
Overpriced considering the effort, but worst of all: another guest found hidden cameras in the room during the time I was staying here.  
No go.

1gd0vdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScaryRealStories/comments/1gd0vdl/taking_walks_used_to_be_a_regular_activity/,Taking Walks Used To Be A Regular Activity ,"  I was once a very active and hobby focused person at a point in my life. I  would take very long walks,hike,bike,and sort of camp out in places relatively close to where I live. By relatively close I mean I was never really more than an hour or hour and a half drive away from home.  One hot August afternoon I decided to visit a somewhat popular nature preserve area maybe a 45 minute drive from home. During the midday it's usually pretty heavily populated with hikers and bird watchers on its many various trails and picnic grounds.  This makes a solo hike comfortable even though I know things can happen in any place at any time.  It was a beautiful day amongst the ducks,herons, osprey, ringneck snakes and gorgeous marsh land I was surrounded by.  An abundance of wildlife and various plants to gaze upon make my mind go to such a peaceful place. Greeting the many other nature seekers along the trails and studying the multitude of signs that map out the 400 acre preserve are standard for myself in these types of places. It wasn't until about an hour in while reading a sign about amphibians in the river winding through the preserve  when I  began to feel a bit uneasy.  A couple of men dressed more like they were hunting rather than just viewing nature passed by. I of course,  greeted them with a wave, head nod, and hello.  They just glared back as they walked slowly past me.  When I continued on I noticed they changed direction and were now following me as I was walking in the direction they came from.  They didn't follow close but were always close enough to see which direction I was going or changed trails.  Trying not to think too deep I just continued on.  After a while I decided I was ready to leave and headed to toward the main trail that leads to the parking area.  Admittedly by this time I  had forgotten all about the interaction with those guys and was more focused on food and a shower.  Leaving the entrance to the main trail and entering the field between there and the parking lot for some reason I decided to jog across the grass to where I was parked. When I reached my car I realized I didn't have my keys.  I take a minute to double check my pockets and look around my car.  I didn't want to seem like some weirdo thief in the parking lot with everyone else out there relaxing and enjoying the day.  Being that I always double check I remember having my keys as I left my car when I first arrived so I had to have of course dropped them.  I then retrace my steps back across the field.  When I reach the trailhead there they were in a patch of grass. As I get back to my car and hop in the driver's seat and put the car in drive I notice something on my windshield.  It was a note.  It only read SEE YOU.  Yes, that is strange but it is a sometimes crowded place during the summer months so I just see it as some goofball's attempt at a prank.  I  start my drive home thinking of what I could eat and what to watch on Netflix when I hop out of the shower.  I make a stop on the way home at a supermarket and pick up one of those precooked heat and eat meals and some fruit. It was baked ziti and some mango slices.  Still not taking the aforementioned note too seriously I pay and leave. When I reach the parking lot just guess what I see. Another SEE YOU note on the back of a very faded but recognizable Harbor Freight Tools receipt. I could see where the receipt was from but not what was purchased. I look around the parking lot and can't see anything or anyone that looks strange or out of place. Tired, I begin home but I take an odd and convoluted route to see if I'm followed. Still nothing strange. I get home shower,eat,Netflix, chill and sleep.  The next morning was a Sunday which is usually my lazy day. I only do laundry and cook or clean and hardly leave home on Sundays. I decided to go out to my car to retrieve some work PPE(personal protection equipment) I keep in a work bag in my trunk so I can wash it for the week's upcoming work load. Opening my front door there was a sticky note gently flapping in the breeze on the storm door. SEE YOU is all it read. This can't be happening is all I think. Who did I tell about going on the nature walk? Who knew where I'd be? This is all I can think because at the time I figured it had to be a joke.  I thought I was sure I wasn't followed or nobody could track me this far without being suspicious or clearly seen.  The work week was normal. Nothing happened that caused me to feel unsafe. But the next weekend was when it started. I like to sit out front on my porch and enjoy some wine at the end of the day a few times a week.  Where I live there aren't really any close neighbors or heavy traffic but I started noticing two cars that would drive slowly by at night. Well one was a car.  There would be an old Pontiac sunfire with a very distinct sound that would come by regularly. It sounded like there was a hole in the muffler and the car was begging to be taken out somewhere to be put down like an injured horse. Then there's a bright red Ford Ranger that sounds like the bed is full of tools and chains that slowly creaks and clanks by.  Pretty much every time I see these vehicles I get a SEE YOU note somewhere on my property. I try to document when I see them and even told a police officer on duty in the area but it's some random when they show up and I'm in a place where the authorities won't get to my property in a short time. The other day I got home from work and when I entered the front door I felt a presence. Nothing was out of order but I just felt like someone had just been in my place.  I check the house top to bottom and it's empty. In my rush to check for intruders I bypassed a single piece of paper on my coffee table. SEE YOU  is all it said.  When I picked it up and started boiling with anger I hear one of the creaky old boards on my back porch squeak. I rush through the kitchen right after I grab the pistol I have hidden stashed away in my hallway and rush out of the backdoor. I see nothing and hear nothing.  Just a light breeze and the wind chimes decorating the rear of my home. Frustrated I go into my bedroom and load the shotgun i keep in my closet.  This old revolver and shotgun hardly cross my mind as I live such a peaceful and quiet life but now I don't know what to think. It was quiet around here for the next couple of days but just last night I woke up around 3am to the sound of very solid and heavy boots on my porch.  I have the shotgun propped up between my bed and nightstand since the previous situation so I grab it and sneak slowly out of my bedroom.  Everything goes quiet. Almost like the crickets and tree frogs took a break.   I swear I could hear the sweat rolling down my forehead. I get to my front door and open it slowly with the shotgun leading the way. When I step out barefoot and shaking I smell cigar smoke and hear a very familiar engine and exhaust note pulling away. It wasn't close but I could see the red glow of taillights going around the bend up the hill from my house.  I type this after spending my breaks at work talking to local authorities about the situation still flabbergasted because I don't have a clue why I'm the focus of this unusual obsession.  I don't plan on going home tonight and I don't know how I'll be able to sleep there without a resolution.  This is unnerving scary and real. I no longer have any interest in hiking, taking walks,or enjoying my outdoor activities.",2,1729995324.0,ScaryRealStories,0,1.0,False
1gd0v6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Independent-Ad-3945/comments/1gd0v6y/delta_airlines_flight_attendant_interview_oct_2024/,DELTA AIRLINES FLIGHT ATTENDANT INTERVIEW **OCT 2024**,"This was my 4th interview with Delta Airlines in Atlanta for the flight attendant position. *Sucks to say it's the same B.S. and my last time applying.* SO ON THAT NOTE LET ME CATCH YOU UP ON WHAT EXACTLY TO EXPECT. (They have changed some things up, but not really.)

Once you arrive at the DELTA campus you'll be directed from the security officers booth to a small lobby and retrieve your name badge and given directions to the building where the day will begin.

You'll wait in the lobby until your host arrives to great you and give you information on the day and try to sell why DELTA is this magnificent company to work for. (Subjective \*\*GOOGLE IT\*\*)

Here you'll see a number of candidates from around the nation just like you.

\- Produce 2 forms of I.D

\- Receive a ZONE (1,2, or 3) - (don't get nervous on placement, this is for organization)

You'll be escorted upstairs where you can leave your luggage and you'll be told to leave everything in that room, (phones, resumes, workbooks, etc.)

Once upstairs you'll be greeted by 20+ current flight attendants clapping and cheering you on (AS IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THE POSITION) (You DIDN'T so do not be fooled by this marketing tactic)

Once your belongings and secured you'll be seated by your zones and they will begin telling you about the day.

This is where the fun begins :-) 

**Zone 1 will go and complete the 1 on 1 interview first. (You will sit with a current FA and a talent req representative and go over basic STAR questions.)** 

**\*\*\* NOOBS: S-Situation | T-Task | A-Action| R-Result (What happened, what was the task, what action did you take and what was the result... Make sure you actions provided a positive result)\*\*\***

They'll talk about themselves for a sec then a little about you....

I do not remember all of the questions but TWO of them for sure is:

1. Tell be about a time you had to work with a co worker with a difficult personality

2. Let's say LAX is where you are assigned. What would that look like for you?

THEY WILL ASK YOU THREE QUESTIONS.

NEXT THEY WILL DO A ROLL PLAY WITH YOU AND THE FA WHERE YOU ARE THE ""PRETEND FA"" AND THEY ARE THE PASSENGER AND THERE IS NO OVERHEAD-BIN SPACE AND YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE THEM AND LET THEM KNOW THEY HAVE TO CHECK THERE BAG. 

**ZONE 2 will be conducting the ""REACH TEST""**

You'll be asked to remove your shoes (Wear clean socks) and reach with both hands to see if you are able to close the overhead bins. (If you are vertically challenged don't be discouraged, have you ever seen a 6'8 FA? Yeah me neither) Then you'll be asked to sit in a jump-seat and put the seatbelts and place your hands on your knees while you sit.

BUT DON'T BE FOOLED MY GOOD FRIENDS this ""test"" is to see you have visible tattoos on your hands fingers, wrists, etc... while you perform those tasks. this ""test"" is no more then 1 minute long

If you have any TATS...PLEASE PUT ON MAKE UP Or something to cover them. no matter where they are!!!! \*\*Even though yes I have photos of current DELTA FA's with hand, finger, neck, behind ear tats...\*\* contradiction much

**ZONE 3 will be conducting the team exercise (This is where they changed somethings up, ill explain towards the end in case they try to switch it up AGAIN :-) )**

Here you'll team up with 2 other candidates where you have to decide between say 20 issues from most important to least important and place them on a board 1-10

You'll have a ""mingle"" session where they'll tell you to walk around meet and greet blah blah. (they are killing time)

(They are deliberating on who they are keeping and who they are sending home)

Last you'll all be sitting down where they begin to tell you more about the position AS IF YOU ALL GOT THE JOB! Please do not fall for that. They will go over several hot topics like where you'll be based scheduling and pay which is the following:

1. During training in ATL is $7/HR \*\*lol i know\*\* (you will have a room-ate at a hotel during training and be provided meals throughout your training) upon graduation it will start at $35/hr.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*35/HR FLIGHT TIME is when you are paid\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

ie: during boarding you're paid $2 until you depart and take off, that is when your $35/HR Begins. 

IE: You have 4 legs (flights) today. Once you get to the airport for your sign in time for say 5am for a 6am departure you are not getting paid your $35/HR until you take off and when you land and get to the gate.  At that time your back to your 2 dollars. So while you're helping passengers board, helping with bags, assisting with needs both pre departure and arrival its 2 bucks....(if you have a 2-3 hour sit time at the next city until your next flight you're being paid your $2 dollars. Rinse and repeat

  
ALL DAY LONG YOU'LL HERE DELTA MONITORS EVERYTHING DO NOT SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS OR ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT ALL THAT WENT ON

THEY WILL CALL YOUR NAMES ONE BY ONE ACCORDING TO THE ZONES 1,2, AND 3

If you are called you DID NOT GET THE POSITION!!!

You'll grab your things and are escorted out the building to the airport or wherever you came from

when they say PLEASE LOOK OUT FOR YOUR EMAILS  do not fall for that you DID NOT get the position

(they will say this several times)

Once all of us common folks are escorted out those that remained after all the zones were called, are the ones that are given the CJO- Drug test and background!!!!!! (When you are being walked out the will try and shade and cover who is left with there bodies...\* for conflict prevention reasons (HOW THIS MF make it etccc)\*

  
I will say this class had so much great talent and they passed on them all. ALL EXCEPT 3/30 of us. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE AIRLINES EXPERIENCE NOR DO YOU HAVE TO BE SOME PERFECT ROBOT during this event. Those are people eyeballing you as if you're some fish in the barrel do not be intimidated, be your self and give it your best shot. IT IS A POPULARITY CONTEST- It has very little to do with where you are currently, (My class had 10+ current FA's, only one who I adored got through).

I've done this FOUR TIMES, Think about it Ive had to apply, virtual interview and make it to ATL 4 times. How is it that not once that I have received any offer. (Some will say ""yeahh i got it on my 10th try""- BRUH WHAT)

LASTLY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GET DISCOURAGED IF YOU ARE NOT SELECTED. DELTA IS ONE FISH IN THE OCEAN. AMERICAN/UNITED/SOUTHWEST are also great companies to join as an FA with WAYYYYYYY better flight benefits\*\*\* GOOGLE IT\*\* (Which is why we obviously initially apply).... Anywho I am current in the business and have plenty of info if needed....let me know. 

Good luck peeps....
