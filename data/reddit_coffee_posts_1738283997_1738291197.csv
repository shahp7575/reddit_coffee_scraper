so I come from a background of ""coffee=instant"" and that's what I drank for most of my life, couple years back I randomly bought aeropress, but with 0 research and knowledge, buying preground grocery store coffee and using random amounts of everything, I decided it's not really any better than instant while having a lot less convenience so I stopped using it.


but lately after drinking some nice coffee in a cafe and somehow finding myself in a loop of youtube vidoes about coffee I wanted to give it a honest try this time. I bought a grinder, scales and the ""flow control"" thingy for the aeropress. as well as some coffee beans that sounded nice

having watched (kind of at random) different videos about coffee, I now realize there is a lot of different aspects that impact the taste etc. that being said, it was mostly just mentions about it and not a real guide.

what I'm looking for is:

1. a starting point, I'm completely lost on where to start with, how much coffee, how much water, how fine to grind, how long to brew etc. 

2. after having a starting point, I would like to know what are the  ""levers"" I can pull to impact the taste, i.e. if I find that the coffee is too bitter, what do I change? If it's too ""watery"" what do I change? etc


would be super greatful for some little tips on that or a link to a good guide. there is SO much on the internet that its hard to navigate and find good sources",1,1738291106.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

We just got to cuddling on the couch when a woman walks through the door, and starts making herself some coffee before heading to the bathroom and running a bath. My husband and I looked at each other, but didn’t say anything. We live in a community where we leave all our doors unlocked, but my husband also works for the police department. 

My husband knows I grew up in a town that had a lot of burglaries. My neighbors when I was a kid, The Newbies, kept having stuff stolen until they installed a security system. So, I think my husband knew I was nervous about this woman, because he squeezed my hand reassuringly. 

She came into talking about how great it was to get a cup of coffee because she doesn’t have a machine yet. She also started saying how great our bath was. The last straw was when she told us the ending to the movie we were watching! I started yelling at her to get out of my house. She quickly left muttering that I shouldn’t be such a llama. Any chance to be romantic was ruined. 

My husband complained that I was very harsh, seeing as we know all our neighbors so she probably was just the new neighbor for the house that was just built. I told him he should have done more because he is a police officer. I mean, she walked in without even introducing herself. Who is the llama here? I think it’s him and he says it’s me.

Again, I don't know enough human anatomy to make an intelligent comment, but when I look at graphic representations of the urinary system, from kidneys to ureters to bladder to urethra, it all appears quite symmetrical. So how/why would my spasms only be on the left? Does anyone have an explanation of my one-sided symptoms? Anyone share them? Just to flesh out the rest of my situation, I'm 73 and was hit with IC for the first time in my life a year ago. I've had no relief from a hydrodistension, six instillations, and Zyrtec, and get some relief sometimes from generic AZO. I'll have a day or two symptom free, followed by two or three bad days; sometimes my spasms will abate as the day goes on, sometimes a day will start well and then deteroriate.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but Ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

I have several compost systems going in my food forest, one is a hot compost system, currently about 6’x6’ that is a mixture of last years garden plants, alfalfa, composted horse/steer manure, wood shavings, etc. I also have a vermiculture bin going really well too. I wanted to create a third option by raking leaves from the neighborhood (cottonwood, sycamore, oak) and piling them within a roll of 5’ fence I had, which is similar to one of those bio bins I thought. 

I started the leaf compost pile a little after Christmas, added a bit of my hot compost mix (maybe five to ten gallons layered in), wet it and turned it once a week. It quickly got up to 145° which was great, but a week later it tempered down to 90° and I haven’t been able to get it to climb. I left town for a while, and came home to still see it sitting in the 80-90° range and it compacted a decent amount. 

Now I have added another couple truck beds full of leaves on top, wet the pile again (it was pretty dry due to being left alone for three weeks) and I haven’t started adding biochar from a pile of brush I have been burning to get out of my yard. 

I’m wondering if biochar is going to hinder my attempts to get it back up to an active temperature, or if I just keep adding the golden liquid of my loins, along with some coffee grounds from local coffee shops. 

Can I add too much biochar to the leaf pile? so far I have probably added 100lbs or so (five to six wheelbarrows) and gently mixed it into the top two feet of leaves. I want to utilize this leaf mulch/compost/mould/whatever to mulch my fruit trees in the spring. Starting it in December wasn’t going to give me much time to get it broken down, I thought since most of the leaves were fairly brown and crispy, so I have been trying to find ways to speed up the process. It’s currently kinda tough to find good nitrogen sources due to the weather and I want to save the manure for the hot compost pile I already have going. I have also read that adding too much manure around trees can be less than optimal. 

I also wanted to thank this sub for all of the quality content, it has really lit a fire in me to be more sustainable with my food waste, yard/garden organic material and my piss. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",1,1738290135.0,composting,0,1.0,False
1ie4fxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantarFasciitis/comments/1ie4fxw/what_has_worked_for_me_so_far/,What has worked for me so far!,"So I have had a bad case of PF in my right foot since last summer. Pain was very bad every day from morning until night, went to my doctor not much help from him so I was on my own but is has improved greatly since then to the 
point that I basically forgotten about it daily. I would look on this site for help and see what has worked for other people so I will report on what has worked for me in the hope that I can help others. Here is what I have done:

:Othortics from amazon in my shoes, the ones I use are called pinnacle the blue coloured ones. The have helped outside of the house.


:  I have a TRX strength trainer that I have been using daily. I have been doing a arms and shoulders and a chest and back 15 minute routine daily routine. I wanted to build some muscle in my chest and back because I have gotten lazy in my old age ( 63 btw). The exercises that I do have alot of foot and arch stretch to them so I'm killing two birds with one stone by doing this.

: I take a low dose of naproxen every morning,  200mg with my coffee and I roll a foot massager under my foot while I drink my coffee. It's just a wooden one with some raised pattern on it to stimulate my foot in the am. The naproxen is just an over the counter NSAID from my pharmacy. I know drugs are not the answer but it really helps me for the whole day.

: I have a massage therapist that I go to once a month and have her beat the living hell out of my feet and calves for a solid half hour the other half hour is back and shoulders because damn it feels good. You will be tender for a day or so after each session but then it gets better after that. I used to have coverage for this with my employer when I was working but that is long gone and now I pay out of my own pocket. It's a $100 per hour and she is a legit RMT.

: If I am sitting watching tv I will massage my foot or use the wooden roller as well.

: I play indoor golf once a week and it is good for foot movement and stretching as well. A month ago I would have thought my golf days were over but yet here i am playing.

This is what i have done to make my life tolerable since and the improvement from Xmas on has been fairly dramatic. I also always wear something on my feet around the house at all times but  I have found myself walking around without shoes without even realizing that I forgot my slippers. Getting up to pee at 4 am is still tender but nothing like the discomfort I had a month or so ago.  

So for all of you out there don't give up hope and try many things ,some of these  things may help you or maybe they won't but you have to try. The key for me is the naproxen, massage and the strength training I believe and movement even if it hurts to do so.

Her way of thinking and insecurities caused many problems in our relationship, leading to its end. We were together for about five years.

For her house, I reluctantly agreed to get a furniture set and finance it under my name, with the agreement that she would make the payments. Of course, she stopped making payments after about three months, and guess who had to start paying? She would come up with an excuse every month why she couldn’t pay (there is a specific reason why she wasn’t making payments). The set consisted of a sofa, TV, marble-top dining table, and coffee table.

When we had our final argument and breakup, she was acting very arrogant, and she said something that set me off. She said, ""I'm hot; men are going to buy me whatever I want,"" so I told her, ""Fine, then they can buy you a new furniture set."" I told I'm taking the furniture, It's under my name, and I'm making the payments; she wasn't. She went crazy and said nobody obligated me to get it. She it was hers and she would have me arrested if I try to take it

She called the police on me, but I have the contract in my email proving it was mine. The police told her it was legally mine, regardless if it's in her house.

The reason she did not want to make payments was that she was raised believing the man should pay everything; she honestly felt it was my responsibility, even though she said she would pay.",8,1738289529.0,amiwrong,6,0.79,False

I've recently upgraded to a Eureka Oro Mignon Single Dose grinder.. it's amazing, quiet, very low retention, no clumping.  My issue is that I don't seem to be able to get any consistently good shots with my Dedica Maestro.  I've been very analytical with the whole thing - keeping the grind the same, measuring the time taken and grams output and even if I manage to hit the button at the right time to get the same ""output"" the taste is not consistent.

I'm using medium roast beans that were roasted 15th January that have a listed recipe of   
Brew Method In/Out    Time     Ratio   Temp   
Black              21g/37g 27-30s 1:1.76   93-94˚c,    


As I'm using a 17g dose, I've adjusted it to have 28-30g output in the same 27 ish seconds.

On the Eureka I'm grinding to 7 and 2/3rds (the 2nd bar past 7 on the grind dial).  

I've settled on a 17g dose in the stock double unpressurised basket with the stock portafilter (with the plastic insert still in it - side note .. does this come out easily?).  I WDT .. but really only to smoosh the grounds around so they're even ish, give it a single whack on the counter to ""settle"" it enough to take the funnel off and tamp .. I don't push like a demon, just a decent press down so the top of the (stock) tamper is in line with the top of the portafilter.   
  
I'm using the double shot button and the pre-infusion takes usually 8 seconds or so, and I'm hitting the stop at 25 seconds (from first press of the button, not first liquid out).  When I first hit the stop there's about 21g .. but it runs on for another 5 seconds or so and adds another 8 ish grams.  

If I stop it early (<25 secs) - it's sharp and sour, stop it late (>27 secs) and it's bitter and dry.  But even at the timings above, it's not amazing.  There'll be a hint of either sour at the beginning or bitter at the end with some nice coffee notes sitting in the background.

I have had the grinder only a few days .. started at 4 (where the shop said) and went up from there until it didn't choke and wasn't gushing.

I will preface this by saying that, I obviously hate what happened and am empathetic for all involved.

Suspicious reason #1: My theory, due to some voice recordings, allegedly recovered earlier today, that this *MAY* have been an attempt on Kash Patel's life. His confirmation hearing was today and surprisingly, they didn't cancel or postpone. Supposedly, there were people (3 assumed military personnel) on board the bird. The alleged voice recording, which was on X, so take that with what you will, and claims that one person was taken to DC. If this helicopter crashed, it's not coming out of the river to make a delivery folks. Too late? Next slide.

Suspicious reason  #2: Why didn't they cancel/postpone the hearing? Sure, secret service here, there and everywhere, but what about the regular cops that have to navigate the traffic and congestion caused by this major incident? I mean, I'm sure there's a large police force, capable of building its own mobile command station, but does CID come in and flex their big greens to local PD, and if they did, why were there still so many LEOs in news footage? Like I get the few down both ways blocking traffic or redirecting it, but the secondary officers could've pushed back, at least behind the fire engines that may have had hoist capabilities helping assist recovery functions from the river. And surely this changed a Defensive level to DC's response right? If half my pd is busy at this, my vulnerability lies elsewhere.

 - I'm aware this one may be a bit of a stretch, but keep an open mind seeing as what we've endured the last few years where fear dictated a lot of officer's decisions, including police leaders. -

My skeptical conclusion: Kash says I can't fly private jet, they'll expect me there and make it look like I've died on the plane, accidentally. Plans for a chopper. Someone leaks his plans for a chopper. They make it look like an accident that the crash happened and cheer. Mr. Patel shows up early enough to grab a coffee with family before hearing. They begin to panic which causes a lot of the outburst style questioning during the hearing. 

>This is all hypothetical, as I don't know the means yet of how Kash actually arrived in DC this morning. He could've taken the subway for all I know. But, to think that the government wouldn't put its own people into harm's way to get their way, is just laughable at this point. Hell, in most cases these last few years, they're not even trying to try to hide it.

TL;DR: did Kash Patel do a switcheroo and not get unalived today?",0,1738288811.0,conspiracy,2,0.43,False

These awards were supposed to be fun as a couple of examples are ‘best dressed’ or ‘drinks the most coffee.’ However, one of the awards was ‘most likely to show up late.’ 

I’m currently on PTO but was notified by a couple of my coworkers that I won the show up late award. Upon hearing this news I was furious and I told them to throw away the trophy. They responded like I was overreacting and told me everyone thought it was hilarious. I’m usually very easy going, I like to make jokes around the office and keep things light, but I feel like this award is crossing a line. 

I’ll be honest, some days I show up later than others. However, there are numerous people I know that consistently show up later than me. I also stay later than 95% of the people in my office (leaving between 6pm-9pm). I believe people only voted for me because I consistently make myself the butt of jokes and they didn’t think I’d be mad opposed to other employees.

Where were went: Conrad New York Downtown 

When we went: Spring and Fall 2024
*We were in the same room on the 8th floor each time.

Who went: My Wife and I

Rooms: For each stay we booked an executive suite with one king bed. Each stay was booked with our fabulous mod u/alex_travels

Service: 9 *( this hotel doesn't have a spa and my bother in law, as well as other friends live in NYC. Thus, I utilize them for restaurant recommendations vs the concierge).

In room dining service is very good. It is also lightning quick. Housekeeping is always on point. Check in and out are smooth. The bellmen and doormen are great. Service in the restaurant has always been good and friendly.

Property: 8

The property is downtown so it's quiet, but it's not close to a lot of stuff. It is close to One World Trade Center, the ferry to Jersey, and has easy subway access close by. It is not convenient to any airports. However, it is pretty close to Joe's on Fulton. The lobby is big and open with a ton of seating. The hotel's restaurant is right there as well. There's a lot of meeting space, a small gym, a barber shop, a seasonal rooftop bar, but also no spa or pool, though they do have an arrangement with a local sports complex for access.The rooms are large. Some of the rooms have wonderful Hudson River views.

Rooms: 9

The room is large. It's 700 square feet and has a door separating the living room from the bedroom. The living room has a large sectional couch, a desk and chair along with an armchair and ottoman. There is a coffee table but not a dining table. All of the furniture is comfortable. There is also a coffee station and an in room filter water dispenser. That is our favorite feature of the room, quick, endless filtered water.

The bathroom has a single vanity, a rainfall shower and a tub. There is a separate water closet across the way. The bathroom amenities are nice.

The bedroom has a very large walk in closet with lots of dresser space. The is a chair in the corner of the room and a very comfortable bed with nice pillows, comforter and sheets. We've only had a view of people working in an office but that is somewhat interesting. I believe there are reading lights in the headboard but am not totally sure.

Food: 9

We order in room dining breakfast everyday. The menu isn't big or fancy but it is good. I've had everything on the menu and the omelettes are my go-to.

The burger and steak are good and always cooked to my desired temperature. The sides and salads are good. The chocolate creme brulee was killer but they don't have it anymore. Gelato and sorbet scoops are nice.

Background: Heart failure in August EF20-25, in constant Afib. Cardioversion done but only lasted a couple weeks, pulsed field ablation done in October, heart failure under control, echo in November showed EF 25-30 but EP recommended an ICD which was implanted in December. Ever since the ICD was put in, the heart failure symptoms have been slowly returning. Weight gain, fluid retention, shortness of breath, coughing.  It's like ever since the ICD was put in, everything is going backwards.  

He has figured out when he gets lightheaded that's when he's in afib. He checks the KardiaMobile as soon as he feels it and it always says he's in afib.  The episodes are usually on the weekends, start in the afternoon and last for hours. Highest it has gone up to was 148 and by morning back down to the low 70's. I think he drinks to much coffee on the weekends and not enough water but what do I know.  

EP calls him and says he wants to start him on Sotalol but he has to be hospitalized so they can monitor him.  We get to the hospital today, they take him back to get set up for the IV and a cardiologist we've never seen before (it's a large group who rotate on call)  does an EKG and a bedside Echo then decides his EF is to low to start Sotalol. My husband didn't ask what the # was because he had a hard time understanding him because of a thick accent.  The nurse tells me that they would be starting Tikosyn instead of Sotalol.  He's been there today and will be discharged Saturday if all goes well. So far he's tolerating it well. 

One thing was strange...he had labs done a couple days ago and his BNP, which is used to diagnosed heart failure, went from 986 in August to 39 now. That's a huge improvement but the heart failure symptoms are back. Not sure what I'm missing. All his labs are good. He's taking Entresto, Jardiance, metoprolol 

I keep trying to talk him in to changing to a different network. I even suggested a bigger hospital maybe in Philly. We're about 60 miles from there. He says give it a little more time.  

How do you know you are getting the best care? Is it the ICD? Are there settings that can be changed? I don't know much about how they work. It's just so strange that he was doing so well until it was implanted?

I've been struggling with having in-laws in our small space for an extended period; not having my own space and routine as an introvert and being reminded of my own family as I observe my partner with his family. 

Anyway, while I marinated in all these feelings some poem ideas birthed inside of me and I wrote them out. I haven't dabbled in poems since I was a young teenager, but it helped me feel a bit better channeling them out. And I wanted to share with people who I thought would understand and relate. I'm feeling lonely and hope I can connect by sharing a poem.

....

When the coffee's hot
And eggs are done
Do you look for me
In the aroma of beans
Or richness of the yolk
Do you look for me

When you open shop 
To balance the books
Do you look for me
In the weight of coin
Or dots in your i's
Do you look for me

When the rain falls
And clouds are heavy
Do you look for me
In the smell of grass
Or greys in the shade
Do you look for me

When the clock strikes twelve
And you rest your head
Do you look for me
In the quiet of the night
Or glow of the moon
Do you look for me

In the fold of a skirt
The arches of a curve
The gravel on the street 
The water in the creek
The seconds in a day
The prayer of a faith 
The corners of dice
The cold of ice
The depth of a bowl
The shine of gold

Anything, really
Do you look for me?

.....

What do you think? I'm wondering what the poem conveys (besides the obvious) or what might resonate with you?

As someone who travels frequently for both work and weekend getaways, a reliable bag is essential, and this one certainly caught my attention. It’s compact, functional, and stylish, but like every product, there are a few considerations to keep in mind.

**Design & Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me about this bag was its sleek, black design. Made from taslan fabric, it’s lightweight yet feels sturdy and durable. While I’m no fabric expert, a quick Google search enlightened me about the material's resistance to wear, stains, and abrasions, which is perfect for frequent travelers like me. The stitching holds up well, and the zippers feel solid. It gives off a high-end vibe without screaming “look at me,” which I appreciate.

[Check Bagsmart Underseat Carry-On Luggage price on Amazon now.](https://bagsby.com/product-reviews/bagsmart-model-b0dhx81vxv-luggage-review-b0dhx81vxv/)

**Wheels & Mobility**

Rolling this bag through busy airports and narrow airplane aisles was a breeze. The double wheels glide smoothly, and their silent operation was a pleasant surprise. There’s no ear-splitting squeaking here, which anyone who has faced that embarrassment knows is a blessing. The bag is easy to maneuver, even when fully packed, and its stability ensures it doesn’t topple over like some others I’ve used in the past.

**Handles & Comfort**

The telescoping handle adjusts to a comfortable height for people of various statures. I’m on the shorter side, but my coworker, who’s over six feet tall, borrowed it and found it equally ergonomic. The grip is comfortable to hold for extended periods, and the fabric handles on top snap together for easy carrying. However, one minor gripe is that the telescoping handle felt slightly stiff when extending it for the first time, though it loosened up with use.

**Security Features**

One of the standout features is the built-in combination lock. I didn’t expect it at this price point, and it was a welcome surprise. It’s easy to set up, and while it won’t stop a determined thief, it adds a layer of security for peace of mind. The lock works seamlessly with the zippers, which are strong and unlikely to snag.

**Organization & Compartments**

Packing this bag was a dream. The main compartment is spacious enough for a few days’ worth of clothes, and the crisscross elastic belts keep everything neatly in place. The inner zippered mesh pocket was perfect for stashing socks, chargers, and other small items. On the outside, there are two long zippered side pockets, great for a water bottle or umbrella. My favorite part, though, is the padded laptop compartment. It fits devices up to 15.6 inches, which meant I could carry my work laptop safely without needing a separate bag.

**Controls & Features**

While this isn’t a tech-heavy bag, the simplicity of its features wins points. The luggage strap on the back lets you securely stack it on top of a larger suitcase, which is incredibly handy during longer trips. The thoughtful design ensures that every feature has a purpose.

**Durability**

After a few weeks of testing, including stuffing it to the brim and exposing it to rough handling, the bag still looks brand new. The taslan fabric seems to live up to its reputation for being abrasion-resistant. I even spilled a bit of coffee on it (oops), but it wiped clean without leaving a stain.

**Water Resistance**

Though I didn’t dunk it in a pool (that would be extreme), I did carry it during a light drizzle. The water beaded up and rolled off, keeping my belongings dry. It’s clearly designed with practical use in mind.

**Pros**

* Airline-approved size that fits under most seats.
* Lightweight yet highly durable taslan fabric.
* Smooth, silent double wheels for easy mobility.
* Ample compartments for organized packing.
* Built-in combination lock for added security.

**Cons**

* Telescoping handle can feel stiff initially.
* Limited capacity for longer trips.
* Overstuffing may make it harder to fit under some seats.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to Samsonite’s underseat luggage, the Bagsmart bag holds its own with its stylish design and competitive features. Samsonite may have a slight edge in overall brand reputation, but Bagsmart’s taslan fabric offers excellent durability for a lower price. On the other hand, AmazonBasics underseat carry-ons are more affordable but lack the premium feel and built-in lock that Bagsmart provides. If security and aesthetics matter to you, Bagsmart edges ahead of AmazonBasics but falls slightly short of Samsonite in long-term reliability.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This bag offers excellent value for its features. While it’s not the cheapest option, the combination of style, functionality, and thoughtful design justifies the investment. It’s a mid-range option that feels more premium than its price suggests, making it a smart choice for frequent travelers who want quality without breaking the bank.

1ie3tdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1ie3tdt/meta_ads_irrelevant_ad_hook_increase_hook_rate/,Meta ads - Irrelevant ad hook increase hook rate?,"What’s your opinion on using an eye catching but somewhat irrelevant hook for your ad? 

For example, if I was selling coffee, showing the product or someone drinking coffee may result in lower hook rate than showing someone spilling a cup of coffee because people come on social media to see entertainment but to be advertised. However, spilling coffee has nothing to do with my product other than they are both coffee. If I add text overlay and voiceover “every coffee lovers need to know this”, will it be better? 

Another example, if I sell dog beds, showing the bed or dog sleeping in bed is not attractive compared to showing dog chasing a squirrel because people wanna stay on the video to find out what happens next. If a good amount of people who keep watching is actually dog owners then my hook is a success, however, if everyone including non dog owners keeps watching my ad then they are low quality audience because for sure they will not buy my product and leave right away. Same thing, if I add “if you are a dog owner, you need to know this!” in the first 3 seconds where a dog is chasing a squirrel, will this do a better job at targeting dog owners?

I’ve been making so many ads over the past few months but none of my ads got above 1.5% ctr because I sell a relatively basic product (like clothing, you already know what the product is and what it does) that doesn’t really have a WOW factor. If I show the product in the first 3 seconds, my ctr is below 1% and my cpc is above 3 dollars. People say ctr and cpc are not metrics determining the profitability. But I found whenever my ctr is above 1.4% and my cpc is below 1.5, I ALWAYS make a profit. Vice versa. 

My hook rate is also positively correlated with my ctr, whenever my hook rate is above 20%, my ctr is above 1.4%. But since December, my hook rate has been around 14% and my ctr is below 1%. So I am trying my best to increase my hook rate, so I am thinking of using catchy hooks that are not 100% related to my product.

Fast forward- gave birth and got the epidural removed and in that time it was the “golden hour “ bonding with my baby while I got stitched up and regained feeling in my legs. Then it came to standing up and I was unable to because of the severe neck pain, making me slump over and having two nurses forcefully transfer me to a chair to post partum area. 
During my whole stay in post partum I only had literal 5 minutes of being able to stand up, use the bathroom and lay back down flat because if I stood any longer, the pain will return in extreme force. Doctors kept pumping me with GABA, NORCO, Percocet etc to manage the pain but none of it worked; only among me sleepy. At first they gave me the option of going home with coffee pills and hopefully it would go away and or get a blood patch and it possibly worsening the pain. I told them I will not be going home since I came in perfectly fine, but will like to think about the blood patch as I clearly don’t want to experience possibly more pain. An anesthesiologist came in to talk to me and hand me a case paper talking about interscap. Pain being a very rare but possible side effect of an epidural but the solution tends to be reducing the dose and or replacing the epidural line. But like I said earlier the anesthesiologist refused to reduce the dose until hours later. I informed this anesthesiologist that the paper confirms that them leaving it on too long likely prolonged damage and that I was in fact a nurse as well. This is when things took an odd turn. Suddenly, because of the odd neck symptoms not presenting the usually possible blood patch solution, they redacted my choice of getting the blood patch done and NO anesthesiologist wanted to do the procedure. Mind you, this whole 5 days I was living, eating , breast pumping and holding my baby completely flat on the bed. 
Luckily, my OB dr happened to be doing rounds at the hospital and requested an MRI which showed a possible CSF leak since my brain was collapsing into itself and was causing a minor hemorrhage. Even with these results they still refused to do a blood patch on me. It took a neurologist to make the final call, repeat the MRI and have RADIOLOGY do the blood patch. 5 day comes. Reconfirms leak. Get patched and almost immediately I was almost fine. No more severe neck pain. 

Now about 2 months later the neck pain returns to almost severe same level as before. Went to my PCP and the repeat MRI now shows I have desiccation on my neck and arthritis. Which was not present in the post partum MRI. 

The amount of excruciating pain I’m in is debilitating and makes it near impossible to carry my baby for even a couple of minutes. My quality of life has deeply dived down. 

Anyways what I am asking is if there is any possible legal action I can take against the hospital for negligence. ?

I used to wake up every morning feeling like I was wading through wet cement. My mind was foggy, my body sluggish, and no amount of coffee could shake the exhaustion that clung to me like a second skin. I chalked it up to stress, poor sleep, and the endless grind of modern life. But deep down, I knew something was off.

Then came the anxiety—the kind that creeps up on you in the middle of the night, making your heart pound like a war drum. I tried everything: meditation, cold showers, endless supplements, but nothing touched the root of the problem. My energy was drained, my focus was gone, and it felt like I was living life in grayscale.

And then, almost by accident, I stumbled onto something that flipped the switch.

A friend—one of those annoyingly high-energy types—handed me a small bottle, smirked, and said, “Trust me. Just try it.” I was skeptical. I’d been burned by so-called ‘miracle’ solutions before. But something about the way he said it made me pause. So, I took the plunge.

The first night? Subtle. I didn’t feel much.

The second night? Something shifted. I woke up feeling… lighter.

By the end of the first week, it was undeniable. My thoughts were *sharp*. That constant brain fog? Gone. My energy? Through the roof. And the best part? Sleep wasn’t just sleep anymore. It was deep, restorative, almost *otherworldly*.

I was hooked.

Then I did what any sane person would do—I researched every single ingredient. What I found made my jaw drop. This wasn’t some generic mix of vitamins; it was *precision-engineered* to cleanse, restore, and optimize the most overlooked yet *powerful* part of the human body.

I had been running on fumes for *years*, completely unaware of how much *gunk* had built up inside me. But once I cleared the blockages? It felt like I had unlocked a hidden superpower. Ideas flowed effortlessly. Creativity surged. Stress no longer stuck to me like glue.

I even started seeing things differently—colors looked brighter, sounds were sharper, and my intuition? Let’s just say I started *knowing* things before they happened.

**Enki Elixir Benefits: My Life Before and After**

At this point, it wasn’t even a question of whether this worked. The proof was staring back at me in the mirror—brighter eyes, a well-rested face, a body that felt ten years younger.

So here’s the truth: You can keep pushing through the exhaustion, pretending it’s normal. You can keep relying on caffeine, hoping it somehow makes up for the *real* issue. Or… you can fix it at the *source*.

Because once you experience what I did, there’s no going back.

The choice is yours.

# The Science Behind Enki Elixir—Why It Works

I’m not the type to blindly believe in things. I needed *proof*. So, I did my homework. What I found wasn’t just impressive—it was *game-changing*.

This isn’t just another trendy health hack. It’s a **science-backed formula** designed to **detox, restore, and supercharge** the mind and body from the inside out.

Here’s why it works:

# 1. Detoxifies the Pineal Gland (Your Brain’s “Third Eye”)

Most people don’t realize that their **pineal gland**—the part of the brain responsible for sleep, intuition, and mental clarity—gets clogged up over time. **Fluoride, heavy metals, and toxins** accumulate, dulling your senses and *slowing down your brain function*.

But Enki Elixir? It contains **natural detoxifiers** that flush out those harmful substances, unlocking **higher cognitive function, deeper sleep, and heightened awareness.**

# 2. Powerful Adaptogens for Stress & Energy

Modern life is a stress trap. Your nervous system is under constant attack from:

* **Blue light exposure** (screens everywhere)
* **Caffeine dependency** (that 3 PM crash is real)
* **Chronic stress & anxiety** (hello, burnout)

Enki Elixir is packed with **adaptogens**—natural compounds that **help your body adapt to stress** and restore balance. Key players include:

✅ **Eleuthero Root** – Fights fatigue and boosts endurance  
✅ **Lady’s Mantle Herb** – Supports hormonal balance and reduces inflammation  
✅ **Licorice Root Extract** – Aids digestion, boosts immunity, and reduces stress

# 3. Deep Sleep = Maximum Brainpower

Let’s talk **sleep**. If you’re waking up groggy, struggling to fall asleep, or tossing and turning at night… your brain is *not* repairing itself properly.

This formula contains compounds that **enhance melatonin production**, regulate sleep cycles, and put you into a **deep, restorative state**—the kind where your brain clears out toxins and recharges at a cellular level.

**Results?** You wake up feeling *refreshed, clear-headed, and unstoppable.*

# 4. Natural Energy That LASTS

Forget the caffeine jitters or sugar crashes. This isn’t about quick fixes—it’s about **sustainable, all-day energy** that fuels your body and mind without the **burnout**.

**Key ingredients:**

* **Peppermint Oil** – Enhances focus, relieves headaches, and boosts circulation
* **Natural Antioxidants** – Fight free radicals and reduce inflammation

✔️ Higher creativity and problem-solving ability  
✔️ Long-term **vibrant energy & clarity**

# Final Thoughts—Is Enki Elixir Worth It?

Let me put it this way: If you’re tired of feeling *stuck*, drained, and mentally foggy, this might be the **missing piece** you’ve been looking for.

I was skeptical. I hesitated. But after seeing the **transformation in my energy, focus, and mental clarity**, I can honestly say this is one of the **best investments in my health** I’ve ever made.

I'm regularly called handsome by both men and women, I'm a few modeling agencies, I've had dozens of hookups, plenty of women interested in me... and yet, I've never felt so lonely. I've always been bit tired of all the people pretending that being handsome as a man will solve your problems and your loneliness. It doesn't, it can still suck.

My looks aren't the only thing about me, obviously. I'm also a musician and singer, I'm a huge film and music nerd, I exercise weekly and I always try to be fun and care about the the people I meet, without being too needy either.

Most of my friendships feel unfulfilling. Since moving to the city, I've only made like 2 to 3 actual friends, despite going to two different graduate schools, and I don't get to see them often. The rest of my friendships are online, either people I've never met in real life or friends from high school I haven't been able to see since I moved. And for a lot of them as well, I can't tell them shit since they will either not care about my personal issues or take forever to answer. Lately, I've just been thinking about how hard it is for me to form actual, healthy friendships. Maybe I'm too weird. Maybe people don't wanna be friends with people on the spectrum, even if it's mild.

I've always been extremely unlucky in love, and I've reached a point where I convinced myself I could only be happy through sex and hookups on dating apps. Therefore, I've been mostly selling myself as such there. While it is still hurtful, this is possibly the better option for me, as actually looking for love will actually be worse for my mental health. I'm gonna get to this, but no matter the nature of the relationship, I've always felt treated like shit by the women I meet.

More recently, I've been specific about wanting to create actual FwB connections. And from there on, there are two scenarios: either the girl won't want me to be anything else but being her pretty one-night-stand boy, or she will accept to go on with it at first, fantasize about me, and then reject me entirely at the first occasion they got for a slightly better option, always acting as I wouldn't get hurt anyway. I never thought I could feel used like that as a guy, and feel bad about it, but there you go I guess.

I could get off the apps, but these small moments when I'm with someone are like glimpses of satisfaction I can't get enough of. Even platonic friendships with women don't seem to work out, and that doesn't even come from me not craving them. They just eventually end up not wanting to have anything to do with me.

I have high standards when it comes the person I wanna be in a romantic relationship with, that pickiness coming from a lot of bad experiences. It has become extremely rare for me to fall in love with someone and, as of now, I have become virtually loveless. Not too long ago, I've been emotionally destroyed by my brief relationship with a girl. We were never actually partners or even had sex, but she was so kind and fun to me while we were seeing each other. She was everything I could dream about, physically and mentally. Our fling lasted about a month, going on coffee dates and making out in nightclubs, before she ended everything to go back with her cheating ex. Based on what she told me afterwards, I'm starting more and more to believe that, despite the connection we had, she mostly saw me as a handsome rebound that she didn't care that much about me. That wasn't the only case where I was just a silly rebound, but it was the most hurtful.

I won't even mention my family, whom I'm emotionally strained from, though I don't hate them either. But they are not really people I can rely on to end the loneliness. Some people could envy the life I have, but at the end of the day, I'm alone in my apartment, and so few things seem genuine.",8,1738287386.0,GuyCry,3,0.9,False

My friend and i started our second year of college in September, and prior to college we were very close (we'd usually run into each other a couple times a week and spent deliberate time together once a month or twice a month). Obviously college distances people both literally and physically, but we both live within the same few miles radius, and we go to the same college. 

During our first year we would usually meet up a couple times (as in 2-5 times) during the semester, whether it was for food or coffee or to study. Since the beginning of the year I see her increasingly less, going down to once in 4 months. The ridiculous thing is it is not just me, she allegedly does this to most people who she doesn't have classes with. Ignoring us for weeks and leaving our messages unread online or liking the message and never responding to offers to get a coffee. 

Inevitably, I understand people drift in college, but I am not in an easy program (arguably more rigorous than hers based on the classes we take) and I have my own connections and life beyond her, this is what makes it so confusing. She has made it pretty clear that she values the friendship, but when it comes to action, or communicating that she is too busy to invest time, she's radio silent...

Can someone really be so invested in their school and ""networking events"" that they don't have time for maintaining genuine friendships? Is it worth it to have a conversation and make it clear how I feel? or would this just bring extra conflict... 

PS : I'm aware people have different needs when it comes to focusing on course work, but I'm talking hasn't answered my dm from 3 weeks ago and we are close friends. ",1,1738287147.0,socialskills,3,1.0,False

He approached me one day at a random class. We've barely talked before that interaction. He asked for my IG and I gave it to him, because I believe in meeting not necessarily just for dating but also for possible friendship. He messaged me that same afternoon asking if we could someday drink a coffee, I have some health issues due to coffee so I told him that I couldn't drink coffee but instead I offered him to go for lunch before class the next day (I actually have met some people that think that meeting in person to get to know somebody is weird). The next day we went for lunch and he said that he had never met a person that would be so straightforward with someone, I actually told him that it wasn't weird for me because I believe that you can't really get to know somebody fully by texting. To be honest I told him that wasn't searching something but I was willing to get to know each other and see if it would work out. After that we started texting and he invited me to lunch like a week later, the thing is he started telling me that he really liked me like to weeks into knowing each other, like he would tell me ""I like you so so much"" and he was like really touchy, like a lot. He would often tell me how much he liked me and how I'm one of a kind, he compliments me about everything, and he would ALWAYS want to be just by ourselves like if I'm with my friends in a break he will insist on how if it was him he would prefer to spend all the time with his girlfriend. Fast forward, we started dating in August 2024, not even a month into the relationship he started talking about marriage, kids and my career aspirations. When talking about my aspirations I often say that I want to travel and that I want to do a master degree abroad, when I say this he would often get ""wounded"" that I'm not including him in my future. Like I'm just saying I want to study. He is very insisting with the topic of marrying, wanting to live together, and children. We met like less than a year ago. If I'm busy he doesn't like it, he thinks I forget about him, when I'm an engineering student as well as him we're busy naturally and when he's busy he goes MIA literally. He will often also say how much he does for me, if he waits for me to able to talk he brings it to my attention, if he waked up early he brings it to my attention, if he does the minimum effort he complains.

I'm a detail-oriented person, I really try to not talk to him if I know it's to late because I don't want him waiting for me so late, I often try to say good morning to him before anything else, try to go to his house or invite him to mine so we can spend more time together, and I really love gifting. Like once I went to a touristic place in my country with my family and he had told how much he loved traditional sweets so I bought a box full of different types and ask my parents if we could go to his house so I could give them to him. Or if I'm doing something close to his house I will buy breakfast for him and I get to give it to him. And he will often say how he's more of a physical love type of person (I personally think that the love languages thing is bullshit) and that he gives things just on special dates.

I know that love bombing is like expensive gifting, compliments, actions, being unable to be without the other person. But like I'm starting to feel uncomfortable. Advice please. Is this love bombing?",1,1738286204.0,relationship_advice,2,0.67,False
1ie325i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/1ie325i/brain_fog_positive/,Brain fog: positive?,"Hey, so I quit coffee about 2 weeks ago. Whenever I quit coffee seem to just... get brain fog after a bit. (i feel like I don't think much either. Coffee makes me have more thoughts bouncing around in my head).

I've been forgetting my phone, late on things, forgot the word for something on campus and i haven't been able to remember it at all. Realized I might've been studying wrong so thats nice.

But the good part:

For the past couple weeks I have been just fixating on a specific topic alot, which wasn't great, but whatever. Welp. Its fine, that let down... unfortunately I wen't back to some mindset and mild paranoia started creeping up again.

When I did drink coffee, it sometimes seems to make it alot stronger.

I.e. And ik how damn weird it all sounds, but.... we have this heater with a shiny surface and a red led, feels like its staring at me. I lost my phone on campus and couldn't find it, was thinking that the librarians there stole it. Saw a phone that kinda looked like mine on one of their tables, so i tried to take a closer look but (obviously) it wasn't mine.  (i then proceeded to loose my phone after I got home as well).

Just was in class and wen't back so some weird mindset i was in where I was worried about things reading my mind, and ik it likely sounds bad but its not as big of a deal if i don't have coffee. (of course, then i get brain fog, which i'm attempting to migitate by working out again).

I feel like with coffee I just fixated on those ideas more, didn't just forget about what I was thinking as much. 

Issue is that part of me wants to un-quit coffee cause I REALLY need to get real good grades this semester. However I've dealt with my adhd issues (diagnosed) before by just working out (and i think i had limited to no coffee then).

So...  what i think will help: warm tea? exercise? (also better sleep, admittedly I've had slightly poor sleep these past 2 days. maybe like 5-7 hours.)",2,1738286072.0,BrainFog,0,1.0,False

With that being said, I can figure out the costs of healthcare online for the most part. The main questions would be related to housing and small or hidden expenses that can add up over time.

Privet Drive.

The ominous fog makes the nighttime even more hoary and mysterious than usual, here in suburban Britannia. Out from the shadows of God knows what dimension steps the oldest wizard in the books. The near dead Dumbledore. He is clearly a powerful beast and walks with dignity despite his age and attire.

He sees a cat that he knows right before he sets to work. He produces a wizard’s tool, known as the street darkener and with a practiced angling of the arm, begins to siphon away the clarity made from mankind’s bulbs. Magical deeds are afoot dear readers, magical darkness a must.

The atmosphere complete, the cat now protected by shadows, transforms into who else but Professor Hardcastle McCormick, and old friend, an ally of Dumbledore, the half-dead. She is truly a great wizard also and possesses many a skill that might aid in tonight’s random errands.

They speak gravely of tonight’s horrible decision. And dear readers, trust me, their work tonight is dubious. What are they to do, are they really going to go through with tonight’s desperate plan? The choice is clearly in powerful hands, as Dumbledore ponders with his gigantic brain.

Just then, a light approaches in the clouds. Shredding through the stratus, descends no other than Hagar the Horrible, a huge man that if you didn’t know better, you may mistake him for a giant hairy truck. He is Dumbledore’s gofer, and now perched upon his sky-leopard; Hagar seems at the end of an errand that almost bested him.

But lo, out from his manly pape, he produces the most powerful baby in the universe. Dumbledore accepts the swaddled child like the delicate button of an atomic bomb. His bowels tense. No false moves here.

Hardcastle McCormick pleads with Dumbledore not to go through with the plan. “What plan,” you ask? Well, they are going to leave this veritable weapon of the gods, this paradox of babiness and power right here, on a fricken Muggle’s doorstep!

But “shhh,” says Dumbledore to the baby, and “shhh,” he says to the lady, as Hagar gnashes his teeth in inner conflict and almost drowns in snotty fearful tears, his master Dumbledore tells him to wait in the frickin car if he has to.

And, the baby..is left. The baby, with the most telling of scars. The baby that is the seed of power. The baby that is the inheritor of the horrible hoary hammer of the gods, Harry, the wizard who was destined to vanquish all evil, and if he so wishes, brings it back again! Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone!

**Chapter 2**

Harry Potter wakes to the sound of his evil aunt banging on his bedroom’s tiny door. His adopted family treats him so poorly he can barely keep from incinerating them with any number of spells he keeps hidden way up his sleeves.

Harry’s room is cool, though. He’s clearly made the most of it, unlike his cousin, Roast Beefy, whose birthday happens to be today. His cousin has no idea of the power he is toying with. He is indeed a mean little puke who is borderline retarded and must shout moistly every stupid sentence that he manages to piece together.

As Harry prepares breakfast, totally magic-free and labor-intensive, his vomit-inducing uncle, Giggle Snort, looks on as the evil mother does the blind man birthday dance with Roast Beefy. The living room turns out to be full of presents for the nonplussed Roast Beefy Weefs.

Of course, it is never, never, never enough. Chunks of demands splatter on his parent’s faces. Harry must stay calm and repress his urges of igniting the house in a demonstrative fireball, ending the life of these three little pigs. But our wolf remains cool.

The day the family is going to the zoo and on the way uncle Pig Fat sinisterly suggests a beating to Harry if he sees any kind of magic out of him. Oh ho, dear reader, it looks like Uncle Salt Porker has some idea of our hero’s magical brain. His face is the worst.

The family seems to be happy with nothing; a giant Burmese leopard-eating snake basks in front of their piggish faces like a poem. And of course, they want it to dance for them.

But not our Harry. The sweet wizard in remission is psychically linked with the beautiful snake-being. Harry, having dreamt himself of eating leopards, boars, and dic-dics. And what do you know, Harry can actually speak with this creature. Will his talents never stop emerging? Harry, with the social grace of a saint, is relating with the orphaned captive pig-hating snake.

It is a beautiful moment indeed and Harry for once feels in tune with the natural universe. The snake has no parents, is dangerous, and is beautiful. Harry sees himself here, in this snake, like looking at his image in the mirror. It is a perfect moment.

Cousin Roast Beefyweefs notices action, and runs over to spoil the moment. Harry totally loses it, and frags Roast Beefy good with a Glass-be-Gone spell. Wah-oosh! The terrible spills his ass into the cage as the supine beast nobly erects himself out and his thanking Harry as he slithers into the nightmare hearts of all of the Muggles nearby. Everyone is afraid of this beast but Harry. Of course, Harry, who is part of the natural universe now.

And what do you know dear reader? Providence must have cast the Glass-be-Back spell! ‘Cuz take a look at the zoo’s new acquisition! It is a play, a tragic comedy, the lament of Roast Beefyaweefy! Ha Ha! The family Porkums is hit palpably with shame. Yes Harry, do laugh on. Laugh right into their unthinkable faces.

**Chapter 3**

As the Hog family enters their home to regroup after Harry’s formidable blow, Uncle Porkflaps tries to tear Harry’s wig off, before remembering Harry is a boy, and probably, his hair is real.

‘No more magic!’ his throat rasps without its usual gravy lube. Realizing his throat is foodless; Uncle Piggums exits for the kitchen.

In the following weeks, Harry falls into a depression. He feels like an exile here in this world. He feels alone and hated. Harry, going about his innumerable chores, picks up the mail, only to be bowled over at the discovery of a letter addressed to him!

“A connection is trying to be made,” he thinks. “Someone needs me.”

Having delivered the mail, Harry tries to conceal his letter, but cousin Ragtime Roast Beefy thinks that Harry has a possible cookie or wafer and takes away the letter before Harry can open it. Uncle Piggums inspects the letter as best as he can with those eyes, and a phantom of fear crawls his goutish face. Harry ponders what could be so wonderful.

In the next few days, a miraculous event unfolds. Birds from every breed and fashion begin to crowd the PorknChip’s home with letters addressed to Harry. The uncle is beginning to feel the pressure. Harry, in a spiral of depression, turns to the escape of miniature equine aficionado. He produces many a wine-out-of-nowhere spell and is drunk every day before noon.

He is only half aware of his uncle’s battle with the birds. The aviary hoard perch on everything perchable, tarping the yard, car, roof and all in hawker-like bird waste and of course, the letters. Every bird revels in the madness it is inducing on Uncle Saltporker. The house, under drifts of letters, molting, and bird shit, now pushes the uncle to burn anything that is represented on paper.

Harry, through a cloud of wizard magic and stealthily pinched valium from the evil aunt, notices his uncle fraying.

One morning, while doling out biscuits, Harry listens half-heartedly to his uncle’s plans for a giant cat to be unleashed upon his feathery foes, but Harry’s attention is drawn to the window.

Sunlight. Harry could almost cry at this simple gift of the universe. If it weren’t for these awful people, he would cry, but he must not show weakness, or else they’ll hand him his ass.

He tries to focus on the yard and the birds.

“Why are they trying to contact me?”

The facts makes its way into his jungle of a conscience, just as a veritable fountain of bird-propelled letters issues forth onto the family. Harry decides that this is it.

“This is the moment. I must make my move in this masking of a snowstorm and I will take one letter into my room and whisper it to my horses and see what they think.”

Oh, how the wine talks. But Harry cannot make it to his tiny door. Even impeded by the onslaught of letters, the now totally bonkers Uncle Porkstar crashes down on Harry. The battle that would have been is now a sad display.

Harry, at the drunken bottom of a depression well and his once formidable foe mindless and flailing.

**Chapter 4**

A crushing blue night lays upon the sleeping porksters. As Harry, awake and active, plays out his happiest of sad moments. Sigh. His birthday of course. But who could care? Especially out here where love is dashed upon the rocks like a rose given as an insincere apology. Love. Don’t give up on it, Harry! Make a wish upon it, upon the stars.

But BLAM! BLAM! BLAAAM at the door. The Porktown family scuttles into position but what busts in the door is far more than expected. It is Hagar the Horrible, the nightmare of hair, a wall of a man. But buried under his woolen chest is a heart I’d trust a baby with. After politely shutting the door, Hagar turns to the squawking uncle and aunt.

His face is a mask that displays he is no mood and he bends the gun that is pointed in his face straight in half. A bullet ejects into the heavens interrupting an angel’s sleep. But oh no! Harry! Hagar confuses Roast Beefyweefs for Harry! No! Don’t take that chili barrel to Hogwarts! Then Harry rolls into view.

“I am Harry.” Phew.

Now if you cry easy, be careful here, dear reader, for Hagar produces for Harry his first birthday gift. It is a cake, handmade, no less, with love, by a warrior of the wind.

“Who are you, nice man?” Harry asks, feigning a child’s air.

Hagar says, “Hagar,” and tells Harry that he is the gatekeeper and keymaster at Hogwarts. Harry is confused, though he knows how to play his cards. A man like this could be in the market for a sidekick.

“What’s Hogwarts?”

A masterful play by Harry. Hagar stumbles around with words and seems put off a bit at himself. Clearly, sidekicking for Hagar would suck balls. Hagar can’t contain it anymore, and just drops his secret.

“You’re a wizard, Harry.”

Harry, with the talent of Lawrence of Olivier, feigns surprise.

“I can’t be a wizard, I’m just…Harry!” again, with the oil of Olivier.

“Well, ‘just Harry’, I imagine that lions are just lions, and gods are just gods. You are a special boy. You don’t know it, but you and I go way back.”

Harry really wishes that he could have a glass of wine or something right now.

Hagar gets up from the couch and produces a letter. It is clear now that Hagar is a bird-friend for indeed the letters are the same as before. Harry begins to read.

“Come to Hogwarts, and become a wizard, Harry Potter it says,” he reads thus, aloud. Uncle Baconface races in to interject a spit parade which Harry translates into a most disturbing disclosure. The pigs knew all along! They knew that Harry’s parents were wizards, of course!

And now, the sickest pinched up mouth of an aunt lets out that Harry’s parents did not die in a car crash, were but of course destroyed in a much cooler way, a wizard’s fight. She begins then to berate Harry’s mom, calling her names, and trying to say that Harry sucks and stuff like that. Her venom is sharp; sucking is nothing Harry wants to do.

Hagar then steps in, seeing Harry is in no state to argue for himself. “This night is going to end good for Harry, end of story.”

As Roast Beefaweefs grabs Harry’s cake and begins to munch it, Hagar describes the pigs as Muggles to Harry. Music-hating, magicless Muggles. He lays down the law on Harry’s schooling, a big fat YES, HE’S GOING. Hagar also goes on to say that the great Dumbledore is the teacher at Hogwarts and will make Harry into a man and stuff.

Uncle Fat Train spews a slander on Dumbledore in return. Hagar gives him a truly horrible look. He points his magical umbrella and starts to say a spell like Don’t-ever-talk-again-Fatty. But then, he’s interrupted by the smacking jowls of Roast Beefyweefs.

ZAP! goes Hagar with the umbrella, and wah-lah! a curled up cheeto shoots right out of Roast B’s bottom!

“Woo-hoo!” shouts Harry. “Bout time he burst that cheeto! He’s been trying to birth years! Hahahahah!”

Hagar takes a sip off of what has to be whiskey and hands the flask to Harry. Harry takes a giant pull and then Hagar says, “Let’s get out of here. You like flying motorcycles?”

Harry replies, “Anything’s better than crawling.”

They both laugh and hold their bellies like two Santas on opposite scales, and then they gather up Harry’s worn out shoes and stuff that Harry wants to take with him.

**Chapter 5**

Midday London

Whilst walking in broad daylight with Hagar the Horrible, Harry bravely reads his syllabuses demands.

“Wands, magic sands, one Turkish massage owl… Where can I ever obtain such obscurities?”

Hagar makes a knowing ‘O’ shape with his hairy lips and directs Harry into a nondescript black plastic business. A bar? Hagar the Horrible, you’d better know what you’re getting Harry into. Of course, the barkeeper knows Hagar’s bar-darkening frame.

“Hello, Hagar.”

“Hello, Hagar.”

“Hello, Hagar,” it comes from all directions.

“Do you want some beer?”

“No, that’s OK, I have Harry Fricken Potter with me today, and we’re doin’ some shoppin.’”

The bar inhabitants crane their fused-up eyeballs in view. They all want to see the legend of Harry P. Old women, leathery hats, and grizzly madmen pinch themselves under the table to make sure they aren’t dreaming. Harry handshakes with all.

The defender of the Dark Arts teacher from Hogwarts School presents himself. His name is Professor Queerman. He stutters, clearly a fan of Harry. Harry makes a series of heartwarming gestures in an effort to calm the professor’s nerves. Harry is truly a gentleman, and Queerman feels at home in his presence.

Hagar moves along the business, for they have tons of shopping to do. He leads Harry out the back door and into what appears to be a dead-end alley.

“How do all those people know me?”

“Do you wanna do some shopping or what?”

A Masonic pentagram is described by Hagar on a brick wall, and SHAZAM. The doorway to a magical world is afolded back brick by brick for Harry’s brain to take in. And ah… Welcome to Calgon Alley.

Dear Reader, imagine music. Lah-deh-dah-deh-dah, alive and market-placey. Violins, taking a break up in the air with non-threatening amblings and a…and a wreath of tambourine, lightly jangled. Enter scene of what looks like 1800s England downtown; buildings crowded in unstably around tons of magical kids with their parents, scraping together their needs for the upcoming school year. Witchy moms, wizardly dads, and worried, hurried Harry acting excited and happy for Hagar’s sake.

“Look! A Turkish massage owl! And look! It’s a bat! Sweet mustache! Wilikers! Harry watches kids breaking their nose cartilage on the window panes of broom stores. This is heaven.

**Chapter 6**

“I'm broke, Hagar. What do I do? I want that broom back there.”

Hagar happily extends a finger at the goblin bank of Wobble Columns.

“You got an account up in there, Master Harry.”

They enter the foyer amongst the evil pasty hobbity-uff goody goblins. They are running the money show, clever turnips, these needleteeth. Imagine a human of about three years of age with antler-like nose and ears, and a jellyfish draped over its head, then stuffed into a leprechaun suit.

Hagar prompts the nearest leprechaun teller for a withdrawal from Harry’s account. The leprechaun, famousness of Harry aside, demands Master P’s bank key. Luckily, Hagar, the key master, naturally produces Harry’s key.

“What else does he have of mine?” Harry ponders.

Now pay attention dear readers, Hagar then very earnestly gives the leprechaun an envelope and says it’s from Dumbledore and that it has to do with THAT vault, that SPECIAL vault. The goblin is in time with Hagar and they know that this is grave business. Harry pays close attention.

Soon, they are riding to the vaults on a roller coaster. The grossest looking humanoid in the world tries to scuttle around on its moon-shaped limbs. It tries to remain cool and orders Hagar and Harry to follow it.

It unlocks the door and backs away trying to resemble what it thinks is a cool looking person, but in reality, it is freaking Harry and Hagar out miserably. The door of the vault swings open and right away starts to blow the socks off Harry P. Hagar makes noises out of his mouth but Harry is not a-vailable. The piles of gold that are his instantly make everything beautiful for Harry.

“It’s going to be OK,” he thinks.

Now on to yet another vault.

“More of my gold?” Harry thinks.

The leprechaun lifts a clawed finger up and down, tickling the door’s back enough that it unclenches in its threshold and swings open no to reveal a pile of treasure, but to reveal a silly little gunnysack. Hagar walks in, snatches up the gunnysack and stows it away on his humongous person.

‘This is between you, me, and the little Patty McGrossOut, ok, HP?’

Harry nods.

**Chapter 7**

Back on the shopping tour and Harry needs a wand.

“Go up in Edvanders’s, I’ve got to tend to a few other details and I’ll meet you in there later,” says Hagar.

So Harry enters Edvanders’s Wand Emporium. The shop is full to the ceiling with wands.

Which to brandish? Which one to call my psychic extension?

Harry irks out a few husky hellos. “Hello? Hello?”

JEEPERS! Edvanders rushes into Harry’s view like a scarecrow carcass, a dreadful visage, indeed. And a ghastly voice, “Harry Potter. Welcome.”

Master H is beginning to feel animosity towards is own celebrity. Harry gazes at the man’s skin, a ketchupy callous of a face.

“I will make spells that save me from looking like him.” Harry makes that mental note, I assure you. The mental notes are stacking.

Edvanders produces a wand that he thinks is suitable for our Harry, but on the first try, Harry totally frigs up half of the store with that wily stag of a twig.

“His stockpiles of nuclear-level energy will be tricky to funnel,” thinks the Edvanders.

He. Is. Tenacious. He pokes around in stacks of wand boxes for round two. A bigger wand, he suspects, will be suitable.

Harry, now bored and tired, brandishes again, but…KABLOOMERS! Destrucción!

Vanders, with a why-didn’t-I-think-of-it-before look, the look that everyone’s dad puts on when he’s trying to pick out shoes and clothes for their kid, even though they have had thought of this before, from the beginning in fact, they just want to draw out the afternoon with needless driving around and tryings on because they don’t know what else to do with their kids, well, he puts on that kind of look and music galore fills the shop.

He stands in front of Harry like some freaking Amadeus. He’s no doubt imagining Harry as his orchestra. A warm light wand, hair-raisingly good idea. Vanders. Is. Flabbergasted. At how good of a choice he has made. He starts to whisper like a thespian in a particularly juicy role.

“This wand’s brother is the wand of that scar-maker. The guy who gave you your famous scar.”

Harry almost dookies a shooter but controls himself. Harry is sick of whispery games, and he says normally, ‘What is this Scarmaker’s name?’

The Edvanders all but holds up a skull and soliloquies, “Oh, we don’t say his name, but know this. He is a badass. He could kill anyone, anything. A gorilla or a bear, whatever, anything. Anything but you,” Edvanders, wasteland of a face, crowds in close. His monologue is stinky. “You are in a great position. You are an army of wizards, Mister Potter. Use yourself wisely.” His breath cascades over Harry’s unbreathing nose.

“How long must I go without an intake of air?” thinks Harry. It’s the only thought that consumes his brain.

Finally, breaking the mood, Hagar taps the window. Holy balls! He’s bought the Turkish owl! Hurrah!

**Chapter 8**

Hagar and Harry sit eating supper in a foggy wine-spewed inn. The depression creeps into Harry again. His powers seem infinite. Everyone loves and fears him, but he himself can’t seem to find his place among them. He is outside of people and the wine flows. So, in an effort to cheer Harry up, Hagar decides to tell the tale of Harry’s parents’ death.

“Valmart is the name of the scar-maker’, he whispers. ‘He’s a wizard with uncanny powers, but this guy is so evil, as soon as he came out of the womb, he put a scar on his own forehead. Well, Valmart went to Hogwarts and started the Dark Side club. It was actually the coolest club to be in at first, everyone got a kick out of being in a club that stories were told about, you know, that’s all anyone ever does anything for anyway, the sake of a story to be made of them.

“Well, you can be sure that Valmart earned his share of stories. Well, the club got strict; you had to love evil and not be shy about using murder spells, or else you’d be murdered. Your parents were some of the people who decided not to kill for fun.

“And so, Valmart went to their house and killed them, and while he was there, he tried to kill you. You was a baby, of course. But the spell ricocheted off your head and hit him instead. Now no one knows if he’s dead, hiding, or hiding as someone else, but what’s for sure is he hates you for not dying. And it’s sure that if he’s alive, he’ll try to finish off the job, probably when you’re sleeping, and he’ll probably look like someone you love, just to make it worse when he murders you. So, you know, be on the look out for that, and, you know, be careful when anyone loves you.”

“Gulp,” says Harry.

“Yeah, sure, heh. Gulp that down.”

**Chapter 9**

Whilst walking to the train station, Harry begins to feel the stomach butterflies accumulate. Hagar is then stunned by the time of day. He must get that gunnysack to Dumbledore. So, he gives Harry his train ticket and totally freakin’ disappears on Harry.

Harry thinks to himself, “What the hell is meant by 9 and ¾? Platforms are not broken up that way. Wilikers!”

Harry feels dreadfully alone at this point, but in a way, it is a thrilling situation. Here he is, a young lad making his way in the world today. The stacks of gold coins in his pockets ease his worrying.

Carting along the Turkish owl and luggage, Harry makes his way up to interrupting a station man, only because he’s afraid he’ll miss the train.

“Where’s platform 9 and ¾?”

“Fudge off, you fuck,” says the horrible man. He’s obviously a goutish fucker.

Thank God for the Irish. Harry overhears the redhead mother of a reaheaded herd of children speak wizardly, and he knows he’s in luck.

“Follow them, Harry,” says Harry to himself. “Follow them or die.”

Watching from a distance, Harry sees one boy, cart of luggage and all, disappear into the brick wall between nine and tenth platform.

“Holy Balls. I’m not doing that,” he thinks. “Willikers.”

Some more kids whoosh through and another. And Harry’s nerves begin to settle. So, finally he goes up to the mother and begs a lesson.

“Excuse me, Irish lady, can you show me how to do that?”

Here in the presence of such an honest and loving family, Harry feels immediate, latent, Helsinki-syndrome withdrawals for the Pork family project. He quickly shakes them off when the mother sweetly crimpsons his bottom and in Harry goes like a reversal birth, onto and into the brick wall that stands ominously in front of him. He overcomes his fears and he is on the correct platform. Ta-dah, ta-dah, ta-dah forever. Amen.

“Well bless my nippers,” cries Harry. “Bless them all day long.”

He stands in awe of the smoking engine, the train that shall propel him to the stage that he was born for. Hogwarts Express.

**Chapter 10**

As the Hogwarts Express drags along the countryside, all the kids’ hearts race in time with the engine. The scene is so beautiful. The landscape is literally peppered with painters working out masterpiece after masterpiece.

Ron Weasel makes his grand entrance and shares the compartment with Harry. The proud lad remembers Harry from the platform and takes a seat. In the introductions, Ron is stricken with a face almost sacred when Harry introduces himself as the HP. The scar is called into question. It is shown and it is wicked.

The food service wench appears. Ron, obviously from a family whose money is spread thinly over the sheer volume of loin product, cannot buy a thing. But the new, newly minted Monopoly chap HP flashes some coin and the new friends celebrate over a pole of cakes and frogs, and nipples of Witch Venus, and rats, and chocospells, and fruitnuts. You know, wizardly fodder, the same kind of junky food you or I would wallow our mouths upon if we were in Harry and Ron’s place.

Ron. Loves. Twizzlers. They talk over the syllabus and what’s to be demanded of them at Hogwarts.

Ronnie tells Harry that he’s a pot of coffee by day, bottle of wine by night type of guy.

Harry says, “Triple that, and you got me.”

They laugh a congenial laugh and both of them realize that they were instant friends. Friends forever.

Just as Ron is about to produce yellow pillows, a spell he has learned and home, pillows of gold, he and Harry are interrupted by horrible creature that is making it’s way down the hall and appears in the doorway. Only upon closer examination do Ron and HP realize that it’s a girl looking for a frog.

Her hair seems to be made up of hair follicle sized serpents, a pre-pubescent Medusa. Agh. She demands that Ron continues his spell, but by mere proximity to such a wretched creature, Ron cannot concentrate and almost kills his rat instead of producing pillows of gold.

She tries to degrade Ron, but only looks stupid. Knowing that these boys obviously hate her filthy guts, she sits down and repairs Harry’s glasses with a pretty cool spell. The boys have to admit, this creature posing as a humanoid has some chops, definitely some chops, indeed. Only after the spell does she recognize our HP for who he is.

She intros herself as Harmony and begs Ronnie of his name. He only growls and smacks in her general direction. This prompts her to leave, and as a last ditch effort to please, she informs Ronnie of his chocolaty covered nose, as if he didn’t know.

**Chapter 11**

Finally, the moment of truth! The God Wheel of Fate has stopped for all of these kiddies on yes, yes-in-fucking-deed you will be a wizard, and this moment is the first in a series of moments that no matter what feelings the moments embody, yes, yes is still the answer. Yes to life and yes to magic.

Just look at their faces; look at their auras. Yes! They are aglow. Dear readers, imagine a music that describes a nocturnal heavenly yes as the children float on the black waters, boating up to the castle of Hogwarts School. Harry knows straight away that this shall be a place where he shall surely brandish his wand valiantly, he knows in his heart that this is his stage upon which he will conjure and conquer the world with his unworldly charisma points. Harry trembles and steadies himself in the reassuring pasty presence of Ron the Bear.

This moment of yes consumes our Harry. He feels here that he is the thing of stories. And for this, he nearly weeps a frenzy of weeps.

Finally, the kids make a formation up to the school’s entrance. They file in up the main staircase and are met by none other than Professor Hardcastle McCormick, rasping her fingerbones in withering patience as the children gather beneath her on the front stairway.

She speaks about the school and that the class that is here now shall be divided into four different schools total. Her voice is chilling, and like a piano made of frozen Windex. Her eyes smoke like smears of fish scales on her candle wax stump of a head. She goes on to describe the systems of merits, demerits, house cup, et cetera… Snoozers. All the kids are too tired to listen.

The professor goes on and drones and talks memorably about different alumni that everyone should remember, but is interrupted by the child whose name is Upfish, who finally finds his frog. A victory for Upfish, but a staggering loss for Hardcastle.

After Hardcastle leaves, a dreadful kid with sunburned hair notices Harry somehow and calls him out in front of everybody. The murmurs begin.

Finally, like a cowboy, he saunters up to get a look at our HP. He intros himself as Mouthoyle, and of course Ronnie busts up at this. The rich little bastard starts throwing class trash about Ronnie the Bear’s hard-earning family being poor and rabbit-like. Of course he goes for the shame spell.

But HP gets Ronnie’s back by issuing a comment or two so deft I can’t even start to reproduce them here. The words do wonders for Harry’s initial cred here at Hogwarts.

**Chapter 12**

The children file into a glorious cafeteria where all the other pre-sorted students and teachers are awaiting the ceremony. A welcoming flute song accompanies their entrance as candles float in mid-air under a ceiling that appears to be made out of glass entirely. The night sky adjusts its clouds above them.

The faculty table is full of weirdo professors and goblin-faced women. There are floppy, pointy head decorations - the true mark of a master magician.

Hagar, Cromley, and friends sit awaitingly. Professor Dumbledore erects himself slowly and tells some jokes about death that most of the kids just don't get. He then after warming up the crowd, introduces the blood-eyed cat that is head of security, and then introduces the cat's manservant, Dazzler.

He then closes with yet another joke about death perplexing some, and scaring most of the children. He sits down, finally.

Hardcastle announces that it is time to begin. Her manners are that of a jilted lover's I-didn't-love-him-anyway sort of mood. The child sorting hat ceremony begins with the wretched Harmony.

A wise child, she is, and reminds herself not to freak out up there in front of everyone. The poor thing has complex on top of complex. She perches on a seat in front of all the kids and Hardcastle places an uggity-buggity looking hat over her hair. It grind dances on Harmony's head, and grumbles pleasurably 'Gryffindor'. Applause all around.

Harry thinks to himself that this will be a long, long night.

Next up, Mouthoyle is called to face the grinding hat, but before his ass cheeks can even start to pancake out on the stool, he is assigned to Slytherin.

Some other kids get up and have their fates directed, and a wicked woman casts a look at Harry that makes his scar hurt. Ouch! This is the weirdest woman Harry's ever seen, a dark, foreboding weirdo that Harry feels certain will be the kind of teacher who paddles for fun.

Ronnie the Bear is next for the hat. Ronnie is certain that this hat will bear down on him and hunch away at his scalp for nothing. Everyone knows that Weasels are put into Gryffindor. Ronnie's twenty brothers and twelve sisters are all Gryffindor students or alumni or faculty. The obvious is true - Gryffindor it is.

Professor Hardcastle tries hard to say 'Harry Potter' like it's no big deal, but the room goes quiet. Everyone edges in to see and hear what's going to happen next. The rustle of bets and cash is muted between robes. Harry doesn't want to bunk with Mouthoyle, but that hat starts in about Harry's potential and near limitless talent.

Oh, Harry only winces at this constant bombardment of pressure to impress. This damn hat, all these fucking kids and teachers looking at him like he's a fucking television.

“I don't care, fuck it. Just don't put me with Mouthoyle,” is all Harry keeps thinking. Finally, the hat's oscillations tense and cease upon Harry's scalp. Gryffindor it is. Yes. And the universe sighs its magical sigh.

Harry is congratulated wildly by his new bunkmates, but he feels numb and distant. A knowing glance is shared between the near dead Dumbledore and the virile youth, and he hopes that he can pound a few cold ones.

**Chapter 13**

Dumbledore casts his stand-without-effort spell following it up with his most famous food-aplenty spell. If ever a room full of children has looked like little hyenas that have come upon a dead family of zebras, it is now.

Piles of glitzy meat and sweetbreads appear. There are sweaty corns and honeyed everything. Talking bones loosen and Harry relaxes into a wine-ish swagger.

He talks closely with his RA. “Who the fuck is that woman? She’s got to be a half troll.”

The RA replies, “No, that’s Professor Snake, she sucks for the most part, you know, acting mysterious and theatrical.”

“God, I hate that shit,” replies Harry. “I’m here to learn, not to watch a performance.”

Just then, the conversation is busted up by a breeze of hilarious ghosts. There are women ghosts and musketeers. Little John the ghost shows up and demands a song of farts or else. His friend, the Count of Reeds, whips lashingly every child in the face. No one is able to escape his mustached giggle.

A ghost dance begins and the kids watch on as a transparent orgy of flashdances and footlooses fog up the rafters of mealtime. Finally, every ghost is bored, and evaporates either into the walls or out through the ceiling, and every student’s belly is distended with jelly, wine, and pudding pops. The dinner is over.

The RAs guide the new Gryffindors into the stairwell. The staircases are a maddening, moving architecture that forever fuck up the students’ days by moving here and there without warning.

The kids climb stair after stair ad infinitum. Some talk about art, others simply concentrate on not vomiting from the intense vertigo.

On top of the wine and the meat that all of the children have eaten, they’re just hoping to finally get to their rooms so that they can use the potty and acquaint themselves with the water closet.

Finally, they file in front of a painting of the most beautiful woman ever around. The RA says the codeword, and the woman in the painting loosens her perfect tongue from her mouth and beckons everyone present to enter.

Beyond the painting lies the Gryffindor parlor. Smoking, cards, and night caps will all be the room’s main function for the kids, the RA goes on to explain.

All eyes are heavy. The day has been a storm of excitements, and the children, after laying out their uniforms and shoes, are quickly starring in each other’s dreams.

It is a beautiful, pale blue night. All the children are wrapped in their blankets. All except for Harry. Stroking his bird, Harry is lost in thought, bathed in the cold moonlight.

“Who am I now?” he thinks as he winks at the night, and it seems to whisper back to him. “You are everything.”

**Chapter 14**

Harry awakes to yet another tequila sunrise. He and Ronnie the Bear are lost and late for their first class. But when the boys stumble, out of breath, into class, they are delighted to find that the teacher is late or out for coffee. But in unison, the boys’ faces scream: “Holy freakin balls!” The cat has been Professor Hardcastle this whole time! Willikers!

As the professor puts together a clever witticism about tardiness and George Washington’s trees full of cherries, Harry makes another mental note: never pet cats that you don’t know, no, never pet anything.

The potion class’s door is thrown open, and in dances that black hole of a woman, with a scar aching glare. She leans with her best effort to strike an attractive pose, while beginning to wet her student’s appetite with a taste of what kind of rhetoric could be expected here. The stark impossibility that such a thing is human, not to mention a human that Harry has to pay attention to is only matched by Mouthoyle’s apparent infatuation with her. They look into each others eyes like two serpents on a honeymoon. Snake, astonished that she has an admirer, Mouthoyle, astonished that he likes women.

Snake, seeing now that Harry is not paying attention to her lips syllables and massages of notes, calls him out and rags on his celebrity in front of everyone.

Harry is surprised for he was only taking notes intently. Then Snake demands from Harry how to make a certain spell. Harry good naturedly says he just doesn’t know. How could he? This is his first day! Christ!

Driven by some unholy jealousy, the unfair Snake presses him again. “What is such and such?” or “How many rat tails are in minkerfuls?” Harry again, with the oil of Olivier, acts humble, demure even, thankful for the lesson. He controls his urge to slay Snake’s ears with a few fiery riffs off his wand. Snake finally subsides her onslaught. She stupidly feels she has cowed our Harry.

At lunch, the kids relax and compare first impressions on teachers. Ronnie the Bear tells him that he could hardly see him cowed as such an asshole back there. Harry explains to the Bear that subtly and patience are a great way to look pretty cool. The Bear has to agree, and they give each other Fonzie looks.

The rest of lunch is spent on mail reading, which is delivered by a host of birds that we the readers are already duly familiar with. Some kids get letters, others get ornaments that quickly fill with mother’s blood, and some desperately wait for their letters to arrive, which shall never, for they are the type of kids that mothers never write to.

Harry opts to read the paper.

Now, dear readers, if you’ve ever paid attention to me, now is the time. Harry reads aloud to Ronnie and Harmony that the leprechaun bank which he had been to earlier on has now been broken into. It was that same vault where the gunny sack had been. It was busted into by what is suspected to be black art wizards of Valmart’s order. Jeepers! But of course the gunny sack was gone before the robbers got there.",2,1738285814.0,LibraryofBabel,22,1.0,False

Then I realised that the inverted method doesn't allow for percolation because how can the coffee grounds even settle down to the base after flipping it upright when all the air is pushed out thus creating a vacuum space causing the grounds to be suspended and floating in hot water.

I watched a few more non-inverted videos and learnt that all I needed to do to minimise drip via non-inverted method is to:
1.) bloom, it creates a more solid and uniform coffee ground bed for the percolation process
2.) grind finer
3.) insert the plunger sideways that leaves a gap to prevent pressing the water through the coffee AND pull back to create a vacuum

On this occasion I did not measure the drip but on previous times, depending on the amount of water used to bloom (30-50ml) dependent on coffee amount, the drip was between (10-20ml).

As a remote virtual assistant, finding clients can feel daunting at first. However, with the right strategies and tools, you can successfully attract your ideal clients and thrive in your new career. Here are some effective methods to help you find clients and build your virtual assistant business.

### Leverage Your Network

Your existing network is one of the most powerful resources you have when starting as a remote virtual assistant. Reach out to friends, former colleagues, and acquaintances to let them know about your services. You can do this through:

- **Social Media:** Use platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter to announce that you’re available for virtual assistant work. Join relevant groups and communities to connect with potential clients.
- **Email Outreach:** Send a short and friendly email to contacts who might benefit from your services. Make sure to personalize the messages for a greater impact.

By focusing on a niche, you can attract clients who are looking for specialized support, which often leads to higher rates.

- Clearly define the scope of the free trial.
- Communicate the value they will receive during this period.

Once you start getting clients, don’t hesitate to ask them for referrals. Satisfied clients are often happy to pass your details onto others. Make it easy for them to do so by:

- Creating a referral program with incentives.
- Providing them with pre-written messages they can share with their network.

### Stay Organized and Follow Up

Organization is key in managing client inquiries. Keep track of your prospects and follow up regularly. Use a simple CRM tool or even a spreadsheet to monitor your leads. Set reminders to follow up every few weeks, showing that you’re proactive and approachable.

Balancing Work and Life as a Remote Virtual Assistant
-----------------------------------------------------

Being a remote virtual assistant offers many benefits, including the flexibility to work from anywhere and the potential for a good income. However, this lifestyle comes with its own unique challenges, especially when it comes to balancing work and personal life. Let's explore some effective strategies to help you create a healthy balance.

### Establish a Dedicated Workspace

One of the first steps in balancing your work and life as a remote virtual assistant is to create a dedicated workspace. This doesn't have to be an entire room, but having a specific area where you do your work can help draw a clear line between your professional and personal life. Here are some tips:

- Choose a quiet, comfortable spot in your home.
- Ensure your workspace is organized and free from distractions.
- Personalize your space with motivational items, but keep it professional.

### Set Clear Working Hours

Establishing set working hours is essential. Without a firm schedule, it's easy to let work spill into your evenings or weekends. To help you maintain clear boundaries, consider the following:

- Communicate your hours with clients and colleagues.
- Use a calendar to block off work time and breaks.
- Be disciplined about starting and ending your workday.

### Prioritize Tasks Effectively

Managing time efficiently is crucial for balancing work and life. As a virtual assistant, you may juggle various tasks for different clients. Here are some strategies for effective prioritization:

- Use the Eisenhower Matrix to differentiate between urgent and important tasks.
- Create daily to-do lists, focusing on high-priority items first.
- Break larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks.

### Incorporate Breaks

Taking regular breaks is vital for maintaining your mental health and productivity. Try to incorporate short breaks into your day. Here’s how:

- Follow the Pomodoro Technique: Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.
- Step away from your desk during breaks to recharge.
- Engage in light exercise or stretching to boost energy levels.

### Utilize Tools and Technology

Leveraging technology can simplify your tasks and save time. Here are some recommended tools:

- **Trello or Asana:** Great for project management and tracking progress.
- **Slack:** Ideal for team communication and keeping discussions organized.
- **Google Suite:** Useful for document creation and collaboration.

### Maintain Work-Life Balance Through Boundaries

Enforce boundaries to protect your personal time. Let clients know when you are available and when you are not. This could include:

- Turning off work notifications after your working hours.
- Setting an auto-response on email during personal time.
- Being firm about not accepting urgent tasks outside of your set hours.

### Stay Connected with Others

Working from home can be isolating. To maintain a balance, you need to connect with others. Here are some ways to do this:

- Schedule regular virtual coffee chats with colleagues or other virtual assistants.
- Join online groups or forums related to virtual assistance.
- Attend webinars and workshops to network and learn.

### Practice Self-Care

Don't forget the importance of self-care. Your well-being directly impacts your productivity. Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as:

- Regular exercise or yoga.
- Reading or engaging in creative hobbies.
- Spending quality time with family and friends.

Balancing work and life as a remote virtual assistant is essential for both your mental health and your job performance. By implementing these strategies, you can navigate the challenges of this role while enjoying the flexibility and freedom it offers. Start small, find what works best for you, and gradually refine your approach. Achieving harmony in your work and personal life is possible with intention and practice.

### Conclusion

Achieving your goal of becoming a remote virtual assistant and earning $100 a day is well within your reach. By following the outlined steps, you can effectively position yourself to take on this exciting role. Remember to hone essential skills like communication, organization, and time management, as these are crucial for your success.

**“Eric, if I kick the can in a fantastic way, I’ll put it in my will that if anyone reports on it before you that my family will sue their ass. ” I remember him saying. (I doubt that’ll hold up in court though, but it's the thought that counts.)** 

**So when the Cargo ship he worked on was discovered deserted I knew it was time to take him up on his promise.**

**When the rescue team let it slip that they discovered a detailed journal in his bunk I did what any self respecting journalist would do and harassed them and the coast guard for several months until I finally got my hands on a copy.** 

**Terry was a great friend, even though after college we drifted apart I will always love him and cherish our time together. When I heard he’d started going to school to become a cargo ship deck officer I wasn’t overly surprised, he was always the kid in class coming in every month with a different broken bone and a hell of a story.** 

**He had talked about his love for travel and adventure so much it only seemed like the perfect fit for him. I remember him telling me that all he wants in life is to be remembered, moralized in some way even if it is just in the memory of his loved ones.** 

**In the spirit of him being remembered I have transcribed the entirety of his journal below. I not only do this to honor my friend, but because if what he describes in this journal is true? the world needs to know.** 

Feb 22nd, 2024.

 

They stuck the newbie with the early morning and midnight rotation. I can’t say they didn’t warn me when I was doing my practicum with APM. 

“I’m not doing that shit, get the rookie to do it” Carlos told the pilot Benjamin.

What Carlos lacks in subtlety he makes up for in knowledge and work ethic. He had been used to AB life for 2 decades. No one knows his age, I guessed mid 50s but everytime someone asks he gives a different answer, when I asked he told me he was 15.

“Not my problem, talk to the new Master, I’m sure hearing your bitching is the first impression he needs.” Benjamin responded.

Ben was a lanky white dude that wouldn’t look out of place drinking gluten free beer at an indie rock concert. He’s the closest to me in age, only being 2 years older than me, and honestly even though he looks kinda like a douche I he’s one of the better guys to talk to.

“Have any of you guys met the new master yet?” I asked.

“Nope.” Carlos responded, pouring his second coffee of the day. 

“Don’t even know his name, they don’t tell us shit.” Ben added clicking the mouse on the control panel. 

There’s about 20 guys on staff on the ship, most of them old timers like Carlos, only one rookie besides me. Sam, he graduated the same year I did and from all I could gather in the 30 second conversation we had in line at the mess hall isn’t much for talking. 

Not rude by any means, just keeps to himself. I think he chose this job to get away from people, can’t blame him. I guess we all have our specific reasons for being here. 

After a while more of chatting shit and dodging Carlos’s putrid smelling hug of gratitude after I agreed to switch to the night watch for him. The new master walked in. Of course everyone is new to me but when he walked in I felt oddly better, like I wasn’t the odd man out anymore and that the old timers and I had something we could both agree on. That being the new master looked like a complete ass. 

He was a tall skinny guy with oddly broad shoulders, his buzz cut seemingly keeping his head from exploding from its own inflated sense of self. 

He wore a spotless white pilots jacket with long black trousers and carried his pilot's hat in his hand. 

Ben and Carlos immediately shot each other looks, waiting for the other person to break out into laughter. The master was dressed like he had just come from a stock photo shoot and had never even seen a cargo ship before. 

“Gentleman, my name is Captain James Pettersson. It’s an honor to pilot this fine vessel.” He said with his perfect posture revealing his previous military experience.

“That’s actually my job.” Ben said, easing his hand awkwardly. 

“Well of course!” Captain James— no that’s too weird I’m just gonna call him James— said making his way over to the front of the bridge. 

Feeling the awkward silence grew heavier than the ship I decided I needed to leave. 

“Well I better go do my rounds.” I said to no one’s reaction, Carlos was still holding back laughter as he finished up his watch log notes. 

Opening the metal sliding door on the starboard side of the bridge I immediately realized we may be in port for quite some time. A thick fog had descended on the entire port, I couldn’t even see the 40 foot containers in the shipping yard just over the railing. 

The air was crisp and chilly with the never ending sounds of New York posing as an infinite soundtrack to our work. 

Walking from line to line checking the auto-tension is still working properly (it almost always is) I got an odd feeling of dread. 

It was probably just new job anxieties not helped with the ere setting surrounding me. Walking through the deck I realized just how thick the fog actually was, the only visible objects in my line of sight were the railing around the bow of the ship leading to white fog so thick it looked more like a blank piece of paper than one of the busiest ports in the country. 

Finishing my round I reported to the bridge, Carlos was gone, Ben was still at his post drawing busy looking doodles on a piece of paper. James was standing straight with his hands clasped behind his back and staring out at the white cloud surrounding our ship.

“Hoping the fog clears sooner rather than later.” He said trying to cut through the silence that fell on the bridge since his arrival.

“A vessel like this yearns for the sea” James adds. 

Ben dropped his head in his hands in exhaustion. 

Feb 24th, 2024.

Holy shit was I right that we weren’t leaving port for a while, I just got off assisting with departure. 

James was on the verge of canceling the whole departure until the fog finally began to lift at around 1 pm today.

When I got there Carlos was ranting to Sam who had a look of either fear or annoyance in his eyes. I didn’t hear much of what he said but something about him was “a fine woman waiting for me in Manhattan.” And that he wanted the departure would just get cancelled already.

When I saw the fog lifted, it lifted just enough for the crane operators to actually see where they were loading the crates onto the cargo line, the fog was still present throughout departure. 

The white mist in the distance seemingly rendered the beautiful New York City skyline as we went for a visual treat for our tired eyes.

Now just the simple 15 day trek to Dublin!

Feb 27th, 2024.

Something is wrong with Sam. His watch notes are getting shorter and shorter. He has been missing random information in the last three entries. First he missed the hatch status, then he didn’t mention if there was any discharge in the VCP. 

Stuff that's easy to forget when we first start out, but when I tried to mention it to him in the mess hall today he just didn’t say anything, just sitting there staring at me with his blank expression. I’m not sure why but the look he gave me freaked me out. He just looked at me like I was speaking an alien language and like he was trying to kill me with his eyes. 

Safe to say, I’m staying the fuck away from that weirdo until he hit Ireland. 

March 9th, 2024. 

Sorry for the lack of entries, it’s hard thinking of interesting ways to write the same day over and over. 

Big development though… We hit Dublin! 

James is still the Hollywood trope equivalent of a ship captain. The other day I saw him leaning over the radar with his head in his hands in utter confusion. As soon as he noticed me there he sprang up like a soldier at attention. 

I never saw exactly what he was looking at but it clearly confused him. We were in the middle of the atlantic, the ocean can have odd effects on people, maybe he was just looking for a path between other ships. 

“Everything okay?” I asked

“Of course, She’s running like a dream!” he said with an air of delusional confidence. 

Good enough for me. Weirdo.

Oh also can’t forget Sam, his watch notes are still missing shit and honestly I’m too scared to call him on it, he definitely seems the type to “accidentally” push you overboard when you're going for a smoke. 

Anyway this port is pretty busy so we are probably gonna be here a while once we dock. I'm gonna go do some sight seeing!

March 11th, 2024. 

Gotta love 48 hours stuck in port. 

At least James let us off to go around the town, he even gave us a curfew of 1 AM. Maybe he’s not so bad after all. 

He even came out with us to the bar last night. Sam even came out, which is like spotting a unicorn in the wild. As per usual he kept to himself and barely said a word, I think he’s getting the can as soon as we get back to NYC. 

As soon as James saw him come out of his uber in front of the bar it looked like he just saw someone get shot, there was an awkward tension between them all night. 

After about an hour of chatting shit and drinking far too much Guiness I noticed both Sam and James were no longer sitting at the long table with the other crewmen. 

I went out for a cigarette shortly after and when I walked out the side of the bar I heard a heated conversation, not quite yelling but clearly a topic of passion. 

Trying not to look nosey I slowly walked my way toward the source of the sound in the alley. When I reached the corner I saw Sam and James in a heated argument. 

I couldn’t make out exactly what they were saying but I think I heard James say; 

“How can you expect me to rationalize it?” 

They noticed me staring and quickly stopped talking and walked towards me. Sam went directly back inside but James came over to me with his shit eating grin. 

“Gotta spare buddy?” He said pointing at my half ashed cigarette. 

When I tried to ask what they were talking about James just kept saying, “Sam just has some ideas he hasn't quite thought through.” 

I tried to press further on what those ideas were exactly but he just kept saying it’s gonna be fine and not to worry about it.

Eventually I just gave up and we finished my butt and went back inside.

March 12th, 2024 

Finally made it back to sea. Don’t get me wrong Dublin was amazing but with the tension between Sam and James I’m ready to get this voyage over with.

I will say Ireland couldn’t say a more beautiful goodbye during our departure. The setting sun paints the sky a gorgeous shade of red, giving our tired eyes a glimpse of Mother Nature's infinite beauty before being plunged into the black void of the ocean at night. 

Setting course for Jacksonville, then back to NYC for the end of my month at sea. 

It’s currently 2 AM and I’m sitting here with Ben completely dead asleep at his post even though I can hear the Dead Kennedys album blasting in his headphones from here. 

If James walks in we’d both be in shit. I should probably wake him up. He’s taught me how to watch the radars and steer clear of any oncoming ships so I think he’s comfortable enough to leave me to keep watch of the bridge for his beauty sleep. 

There’s something about the sea, especially the sea at night. You are in an environment that you — by any measure of human comprehension — are not welcome in. 

Right now I could take a step over a railing the height of my nipples and there would never be a trace of my physical body again. No matter how strong you are or how well you can swim, the endless waves just a few feet away have infinite energy and infinite time. 

I hate the way my mind wanders during these night shifts. I’m gonna wake Ben up. 

March 14th, 2024.

I’m done with Sam’s shit. If he’s having some mental breakdown he needs to just get off in Jacksonville and get help. 

His notes still suck, he refuses to take any accountability or even listen to me when I try to show him what he’s missing. I even offered to join him on watch and show him how to communicate what you do in the notes. The fucker just looked at me with a threatening silence that made the ice cold ocean seem welcoming. 

He also started doing this thing, I don’t know how to explain it without just showing you the notes. Ever since we left Dublin he has added seemingly random words to the end of each of his notes. 

I’ll write down an example here if that helps.

“Lights and Gainway tended, Cargo inventory complete, security LVL 1 is maintained. **SOON**”

The last word in that makes no sense. “**SOON**”. 

That was the first one that happened yesterday. Today he left the word “**BACK**”. 

I don’t even know what to make of it or if I should care at all. I’m gonna talk to James about sending him home once we reach Jacksonville, some people just aren’t built for the isolation of the ocean. 

March 17th, 2024 

I think the tension on the ship is reaching a boiling point. Carlos and I seem to be the only ones getting along. Ben still hates James, James hasn’t left the bridge in almost 24 hours. 

Sam is still being weird, still doing the weird random words thing. The last few have been; “**STILL, FINGERS, STOPPED, WARMER**.” in that order. 

I’m getting so sick of these guys man, most of my time not on shift I just hide in my room or exchanging rants with Carlos in the mess hall. 

I just have this feeling I can’t get over that something is coming, the nights are long. I have been losing more and more sleep every night since we left Dublin. Last night I had an awful panic attack as soon as I set foot on the bridge. 

My heart was pounding in my chest, I felt freezing but began to sweat like a pig. Carlos saw me standing in the doorway of the bridge and just before my knees buckled he grabbed me a desk chair and practically forced me to sit down and grabbed me a water. 

“Don’t worry about it man, everyone gets a bit jittery in the open ocean from time to time.” He said, patting me on the back before returning to finish his notes. 

I really like Carlos, with everything that's been going on I feel like he's the only normal person on this ship. In the few hours of sleep I have been getting I have been having recurring nightmares that the men on this ship are the last people on earth. 

We keep sailing forward for weeks and weeks never reaching land. Like we are sailing on another planet that has nothing but ocean that goes on forever. 

Jacksonville can’t come fast enough.

When I first mentioned adopting one, my husband, Mark, wasn’t on board.

""They’re needy. They shed. They stink.""

It took weeks of convincing. Mark wasn’t a cat person. He saw pets as unnecessary responsibility, but I’d been working from home too long, and the house was too quiet. I needed company. Something *alive*.

Eventually, love won out.

""Fine,"" he sighed, rubbing his temples. ""But you’re scooping the litter.""

Milo was perfect. An orange tabby—affectionate, bright-eyed, and warm. The moment I picked him up from the shelter, he purred and rubbed against my chin like he had *chosen me*.

But I remember the shelter worker’s hesitation.

""He’s been returned a few times,"" she said, eyeing me carefully. ""Some cats take time to settle. Just be patient with him.""

That night, Mark barely acknowledged him. ""We’ll see how long before I’m covered in cat hair.""

But Milo wormed his way into Mark’s heart fast. Soon enough, they were inseparable. Milo would leap onto the couch, curling up against Mark’s chest as he scrolled his phone.

""Okay, okay, he’s alright,"" Mark admitted one night, scratching behind Milo’s ears. ""You were right. We needed a pet.""

I should have been happy. But by then, I’d already noticed it—his routine.

Every day, at exactly 3:07 PM, Milo would stop whatever he was doing, climb onto the couch, and stare at the wall. For 23 minutes.

No blinking. No movement. Just staring.

At 3:30 PM sharp, he stretched, hopped down, and rubbed against my legs like nothing happened.

At first, I thought it was funny—a little cat quirk. Cats are weird. I laughed about it with my friends.

""Probably a ghost,"" they joked. ""Cats can sense those things.""

But one day, I tried to pick him up while he was staring and he turned on me.

A deep, rattling hiss. Pupils dilated. Ears flattened. His little body vibrating with anger—then he lunged.

I screamed as his claws raked across my stomach. The sharp sting followed immediately, hot and wet. I gasped, looking down. My shirt was damp. Sticky. Blood. A deep, jagged scratch ran across my abdomen.

The moment I put him down, he turned back to the wall. Staring. Like nothing had happened.

Then the accidents started.

Little things at first.

That day, I was working late—my inbox overflowing, my head pounding. I leaned back, stretching, rubbing my tired eyes.

Break time.

I wandered into the kitchen, grabbed a protein bar—chocolate almond, my go-to. I peeled the wrapper and took a bite. Then stopped. Something was wrong. The texture was off. Oily. Wrong. A wave of nausea rolled through me as the taste hit—*Tuna.*

Rotten, thick, briny. It clung to my tongue like something dead. I gagged, stumbling to the sink, spitting into the drain, wiping my tongue with the back of my hand.

My breath came in short, panicked bursts. It was a chocolate almond bar. No fish. No seafood. No reason it should taste like that.

I turned back to the living room. Milo was still staring at the wall but his ears twitched—ever so slightly—like he was listening. A slow, steady purr rumbled from deep inside his chest.Watching.

The next day, I tried to ignore it. I had work to do. Deadlines. I buried myself in emails, forcing my mind to stay present.

Then—3:07 PM. I swallowed hard.

3:10. Milo leapt onto the couch.

3:15. My hands trembled over the keyboard.

3:20. I was drenched in sweat.

And at 3:21 PM, the ceiling fan groaned.

I felt it before I heard it—an unnatural weight pressing down. The overhead light flickered. Then the sound. A deep, wrenching creak.

I looked up.

The fan wasn’t moving. It was shaking. The screws grinding loose. Plaster cracking in jagged lines along the ceiling and —a deep, sickening pop.

I dove aside just as the entire fan tore free, crashing onto my desk. Metal blades buried into the wood like knives. My monitor shattered, coffee splattering across the floor in an explosion of glass and ceramic.

I lay there, panting, my heart hammering against my ribs.

I turned my head.

 Milo had moved from the couch. I looked at my watch—3:30 PM. So slowly, I swear his mouth moved. No sound. Just shaping the words, *Missed again.*

That night, I confronted Mark.

I lifted my shirt, revealing the still-healing claw marks. ""He stares at the wall every day at 3:07 PM. And every time he does—something happens.""

Mark sighed. ""Sarah, come on."" He pointed at Milo, curled up by the fireplace, purring softly. ""Look at him. He’s fine.""

""You don’t see what I see.""

He rolled his eyes. ""You work from home, babe. Maybe you’re just lonely. A little too focused on the cat.""

The next day, I set up my phone on the coffee table, angling the camera to capture the couch, the wall, and most importantly—Milo so that when 3:07 PM rolled around, I was ready.

A tension, thick and humming, settled over the room like a warning. I swallowed hard, checking the time. 3:10. Three minutes in.

I sat at my desk, pretending to work, but my focus was entirely on him.

Then, I smelled smoke.

A wisp of gray curled from the kitchen. My stomach dropped.

*The stove. No—I wasn’t cooking. I hadn’t even gone near it today.*

My chair clattered to the ground as I bolted to the kitchen. The burner was on, glowing an angry orange. The dish towel beside it was already curling at the edges, blackened, smoldering. The fire leapt to the curtains.

""Shit. Shit.""

I grabbed the extinguisher from under the sink and pulled the pin. Foam blasted over the flames, choking them out before they could spread further.

I turned toward the living room. Milo was still sitting there. Unmoved. Unblinking. Watching. And just like that, at 3:30 PM, he stretched, hopped down, and brushed against my leg with a soft purr—like nothing had happened.

I could barely breathe. My hands were shaking as I grabbed my phone from the coffee table.

""This time, I caught you, you little bastard!""

The moment I heard Mark’s keys in the door, I bolted from the couch. My hands were still shaking, adrenaline buzzing through my veins.

“Mark!” I nearly tripped over Milo as I ran to him. The cat slinked between my legs, purring as if he hadn’t spent half hour of the day warping reality.

Mark barely had time to drop his bag before I shoved my phone in his face.

“I got him. I recorded the whole thing. Now you’ll believe me.”

Mark sighed, rubbing his temples. “Jesus, Sarah, what now?”

I didn’t bother explaining—I just hit play.

The footage loaded but there was just… me sitting on the couch, in Milo’s spot. My hands folded neatly in my lap. My body still. My eyes, wide and unblinking, locked on the wall.

I watched, horrified, as my on-screen self didn’t move for exactly 23 minutes. Then, at 3:30 PM, I blinked. I stood up. Walked back to my desk and started typing—like nothing had happened.

My entire body went cold.

“No,” I whispered. “That’s not what happened. That’s not what happened, Mark. I was in the kitchen. The stove turned on. The fire—”

Mark turned to me, his concern deepening.

“Sarah,” he said, his voice soft. “Honey… you’re not a cat.”

The blood drained from my face.

“I think it’s time to up your meds.”

Milo pushed against Mark’s leg, purring loudly, rubbing his little face against his shin.

Mark sighed, bending down to scratch under the cat’s chin. “At least someone’s normal around here.”

I staggered back. My legs felt weak, my mind spiraling. I wasn’t crazy. I wasn’t. But the video… The footage said otherwise.

That evening my fingers trembled as I pulled up the number for the shelter. It rang twice before a familiar voice answered.

“Green Haven Animal Rescue, this is Kelly.”

I swallowed, my throat dry. “Hi, um… I adopted a cat from you a few months ago. His name is Milo.”

Silence.

Then a cautious “Yes… I remember Milo.”

There was something in her tone. Something guarded.

I pushed forward. “I just—I was wondering if you could tell me anything about his previous owners?”

A pause. “Why?”

I hesitated. I couldn’t tell her the truth. She’d think I was insane.

“I—uh—just wanted to know more about where he came from. He’s got some weird habits.”

Another pause. A deep breath.

“Milo’s had four previous owners.”

I stiffened. That many?

“Do you have their names?”

Kelly sighed. “Sarah, I don’t think—”

“Please.”

A long silence stretched between us. Then, she rattled off four names. I wrote each one down.

Karen Woods.
Alan Reed.
Debra Mitchell.
John Lanning.

“What happened to them?” I asked.

Another pause. Then, softer: “Look them up.”
The line clicked dead.

I stared at the names on the notepad, my heart pounding. Slowly, I opened a browser and typed in the first name.

Karen Woods.
A local news article popped up. Found dead in her home. Cause of death: fatal head injury after a mysterious fall down the stairs. Time of death: between 3 and 4 PM.

My stomach clenched.

I searched the next name.

Alan Reed.
House fire. Cause unknown. Time of death: 3:21 PM.

My hands shook.

Debra Mitchell.
Drowned. In her own bathtub. 3:15 PM.

John Lanning.
Car accident. Brakes failed. Died instantly. 3:28 PM.

I slammed my laptop shut, my breath ragged.

Four owners. Four freak accidents. All between 3 and 4 PM.

I looked over at Milo. He was sitting in his usual spot on the couch. Watching me.

I wasn’t taking any chances.

That night, I grabbed the cat carrier from the closet, my pulse pounding in my ears. Milo was curled up on the couch, tail flicking lazily, eyes half-lidded. He didn’t resist when I scooped him up—just stretched, yawned, and let me place him inside.

The carrier door clicked shut.

He blinked up at me, slow, unreadable. I wrapped a hoodie around the carrier to muffle any sounds, tiptoed through the house, and slipped outside. The air was cold, sharp against my burning skin. My car was parked in the driveway, keys already in the ignition. I placed the carrier in the passenger seat, started the engine, and pulled out onto the road.

I didn’t breathe until I was out of the neighborhood.

The drive to Blackwood Forest took twenty minutes. My hands shook the whole way. Milo was silent—no yowling, no scratching, no distress. Just silence. That unnatural, knowing silence.

I kept my eyes on the road. I wouldn’t change my mind.

At the forest entrance, I killed the engine and grabbed the carrier, hauling it deep into the woods. The trees loomed overhead, thick and endless.

I set the carrier down. My fingers hovered over the latch. Milo blinked up at me. His pupils were wide, reflecting the moonlight like twin coins.
I exhaled sharply and swung the door open.

He didn’t move.

“Go.” My voice was a whisper. A plea.

Milo just sat there, watching me.

My stomach twisted. Every part of me screamed to turn around, to run, but I couldn’t move—not until Milo did.

Then, slowly, he stepped forward. Paws sinking into the damp earth. His tail flicked once. He stretched, arched his back, and walked into the trees without looking back.

He was gone.

I stumbled backward, gasping, the weight in my chest finally lifting.

I’d done it. I was safe.

I turned, ran back to the car, and drove home, the tension draining from my muscles with every mile. I pulled into the driveway, gripping the steering wheel, my body trembling with exhausted relief.

Mark was still awake. I saw the glow of the living room lamp through the window. I forced myself to breathe, wiped the sweat from my palms, and stepped out of the car.

I was free.

I stepped inside, Mark was on the couch, legs kicked up, watching TV. He looked over and grinned. 

“Hey, babe. Where’ve you been?”

And then I saw him—Milo.

Perched on Mark’s lap, purring, rubbing his head against Mark’s hand.

My stomach dropped. My vision swam.

Mark scratched behind his ears. “I think he missed you.”

1ie2eqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/1ie2eqx/does_anyone_feel_the_same/,Does anyone feel the same?,"Hello everyone, it is my first time posting after some time lurking.. i still feel a bit vulnerable sharing with you guys, after a lifetime of being quite misunderstood haha! 


Here is a bit of my background (English is not my first language): I learned about my giftedness last year after starting therapy with a quirky psychologist..himself gifted. After years of feeling different, adapting to fit in to the point of forgetting who I really was, as I felt I was a thousand people in one and that any point of view could be truthful if viewed under a certain perspective, I was finally given a clue about what the hell was weird with me. 
I had been told by teachers,throughout primary education and high school that i’m gifted, but I always thought it was just a nice way of saying that I do well in school. At home I seemed to never be good enough for my parents, and was called a narcissist when I would open up in debates or would share my insights about the topics that would get me so excited. (The funny part is that when i was diagnosed with giftedness they told me: ‘what? You didn’t know?! We always spoke to you like to an adult, ever since you were little, because you understood everything. It was unsettling.’ My close friends all seemed unimpressed. They all said: ‘well yeah. It’s obvious!’ And I was just like Why didn’t anyone tell me?!  Anyway, better now than never. It’s just a diagnosis, it’s a spectrum, every gifted person is different, doesn’t change much of anything. I was already straying away from the conventional timeline people around me follow and (thank god!!) had found a crowd i finally fit in with. Autistic folks, artists, gifted, weird, crazy, highly highly sensitive, imaginative people, filled with freedom. So much freedom! Family friends got really upset with me. ‘What more could you possibly have in common with a girl wearing dreadlocks than with us??’ Well it’s not about the damn dreadlocks. I couldn’t care less. She could look like a social media influencer or dress like a stay at home mom from the 50s. I can finally talk with someone!! Like, really talk. Build on eachother’s ideas and feel that awesome mental orgasm of really using your fucking brain. 

Sorry. I got carried away. 
Anyway, I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice. I’m currently finishing an undergrad in microbiology/immunology and I still haven’t found how to study. I usually read the lectures the night before the exam and just take my test. Works well, but it’s starting to take a toll on me. 
I tried studying in advance but I get caught up in the details and it takes me hours and hours for a single lecture. For the life of me, if I don’t have a close deadline I cannot ignore all the complexities, small details, differences, hypothetical problems with certain methods, further questionings, etc etc…  and focus on what is important. Everything seems to be of the utmost importance, I end up researching stuff and going on tangents. I’ve accepted that I can only study before a test. However, it used to be 3 days before, that turned into 1 day before, that turned into the night of, that lately turned into right before. I’m talking learning two chapters while already sitting in the exam room. I scored A+ on that test, and I’m not saying this to boast, I’m seriously at my wits end as I find it’s enabling my behavior. Like my parents would say, I wish i had messed up, then maybe i would have learned my lesson. Whenever i study i pull all nighters, drink a shit ton of coffee and smoke a million cigarettes. Do I study all night? Hell no! I end up on Google researching a bunch of unrelated stuff feeling like ‘i still have time’ because it’s ‘only 3am’.  This is starting to take a toll on my late twenties body. 

It’s an undergrad degree. I just need to learn some biological pathways by heart. It’s not that deep, like they say.

I’m a 25-year-old woman living near Concord, MA, and I’m hoping to meet some cool people around here!

A bit about me:

* I studied Fashion Merchandising in NY but moved back to Concord a couple of years ago to be closer to family. It’s been a bit tricky to make friends, so I thought I’d try this out!
* I’m currently on a sober, alcohol-free journey. I’m cool with being around people who drink (just not my thing), but I love doing *weed* from my favorite local dispensaries! 😎🌱 I am even down to check out a brewery with you, most places have alcohol free options nowadays. 
* Here are some other things I enjoy doing:
* Hanging out at local coffee shops ☕Gaming on my Nintendo Switch OLED (Splatoon 2, Mario Kart, Smash Bros) 🎮Running and hiking in the area 🏞️Reading, writing, and anything creative 📚✏️Exploring diners, sports bars, and casual hangouts 🍔🍻Shopping, nail salons, and spa days 💅Checking out dispensaries and consumption lounges 🌿

**What I’m looking for in a friend**:

* I feel more comfortable around other women, and as a bisexual person, I’d love to meet other LGBTQ+ folks! 💖
* I’m spiritually inclined but not religious—attend a non-denominational church weekly. I would love fellow practicing witches to read my tarot cards with. 
* Open-mindedness is key—I enjoy chatting with people who are chill about different political views and lifestyles. 🌎
* I’m neurodivergent (ADHD & C-PTSD), so I tend to connect with people who understand or share similar experiences.
* I don’t have a driver’s license (I didn't have it taken from me, I just never got around to learning, I am a total city girl).... , so I rely on Ubers for getting around. Don’t worry, I won’t ask for rides! 😅
* I’m sensitive to tobacco and nicotine smells, so I prefer friends who don’t smoke those. 🚭
* Bonus points if you’re into Disney, Harry Potter, or love animals (I have a 3-year-old ragdoll cat, and I grew up with dogs and fish) 🐱🐶🐟

Ideally, I’m looking to meet people who are also local to the Framingham/Concord area. If you’re down for coffee, games, or just a chill hangout, I’d love to connect!",0,1738284120.0,r4r,1,0.33,False

As I x time before left my Capital C and wasted money on loosing businesses in small cities, its crazy, if you have idea where I can support your project that would have 2000 USD pricetag for you, even bigger but I will take just 2k, I can rent a place at least for starters 🤪 I take agreed upon deposit for 1k, send over to order preview and either happiness comes, and I take 1k and continue to fight, or you don't like it and as per agreement money will be back. I take even legalytynotbylegality money, crypto and gift cards with just 20% bonus. Any insuflated money can be cleaned but I cant know anything about anything if that's needed, my colabsing country of Czechia, has nice law to protect me if I don't have idea about anything. But it does not fix the 40% of people being under unlovable conditions. Maybe future teller ai would be a nice thing, I would never left my home if I knew that my clients from fyzical world when I did innovations will stop inovatong as customers just dont buy, it's one story all over again. 

If you are manager of AI boosted research, innovation, or you know, just have nice paying job and can help me to rent apartment and take it from salary, iam good and effecient (my survival trying is now at little over 100 days/20h average work hours a day , I may send bank logs showing I spend only on fun, food, and happines like 4k USD a month for last 4 years, and this is 5 salary's locally,  I hope it was not thru wives acc, but who makes coins works as efficient joints. 

I can do, just it's hard when after super crash they put you to hospital and important people that you know will help as you helped, mostly suicided or disappeared. I can move to any place with net over 5mb/s up/down, I will run over vps anyways with as much gb/s I can pay.

I take commision/project based work, I have knowledge In: sales (was top3 for TMobile like 2020), automation system integration to corporate crms like Salesforce ( that I did for TMobile when my integration preview got to manager that managed my manager of top sales in Czechia, of you know corp. 3 tiers is funny big to even meet in career), small team management to 5 people, herbalism, biochem, prompting, API basic to telegram comm, code by pro or ai based integration for small to medium sized integration (py, react, js, html, ssh, vps, VPN, relay, node, rest, android ides, API, html requests, webhooks, embedding, git, css, Tor gateway, tor hosting, onions, cybersec ( if you are better than me in cyber sec since that's my love, tou should be understanding that thefe is cookie and it's danger, but flash cookie is hydrogen explosion against it)   and then the llm running, fine tuning etc, but those are not surely at more than amateur lvl. Like, I have spend last few years around ais, torsec, research of topics at ai propelled speed with good prompt understanding, I can make chatgpt talk with me about most illegal things and harm, death related topics. That's not only indicstor but should relay some info. 

That's my personal hearth and mind twisting blog kind of post, and since iam already at point where my blood pressure is dropping below 70/40 in mornings, doctor told me to sleep, sit while working in say, and rehabilitate each session that they have here, or IM injection that is already 6 days old  of magnesium sulfate, nic salt, ethanol will kill me if Iam gonna overwork, with no stability, laying in bed. But I told her that either this injection will kill me if I work, or cold will kill me if I don't, so I might as well smoke wall paint in cigarette and at least not suffer at it, just little mouthfoam, I know this is crazy but only way to get thoughts straight and one guy on Reddit wrote note for himself how he's a worthless crap licker, and people talked, rated, hummiliated and each just did as he preferred, it seemed he got some good critics, and hopefully when this is for llm and databased faijnsmekers, documents of 100 pages should be a crunchy bit of bacon in morning, or crackers crunch, as you wish.

If tou need just anything that pays, write me dm and I will see, any offer that will result in 2000 USD to 6 days, may be the 12 but you know, if I get scammed I need week to do somethig. 

IAM offering personally finished research, recipes, descriptions for 10 worst psychological illness herbal based medicíně with complex recipes that can when dissasembeling the illnesses to symptomatology, then each symptomatology can be proven to be affected with in allot of cases even better procentage of reducing symptoms than medication basic for the illness, and for some there modernedicine has no reach thanks to little care about real feelings, they mostly will sedate you (maybe 95% of all psychiatric pills are sedatives with crazy chemical names, but doctors won't tell you how they work as they have no idea, just the research of some pharma, that 60% of prescribed patients said its better) but then they come to a roadblock outside, they are dead for some of the illnesses, just modern lobotomy, trust me, I spent around and more than 1 year co tinuous waking time conversating with patients, and they just mostly mix some benzo, main pill that will be sedative as well (antipsychotics- extreme lobotomy, and most returning patients are psychotic people of many diagnoses, suicidal) moderní medicine never looks at disadvantages and risks in psychiatry, people die regurally but nobody cares as it's in the document for most of pills : sudden death. And other crazy complications. And when we speak about inadequate quality of care for risk assessment as every doctor need to follow, lithium, the most used mood stabilizer is given, the real chemical inside is specifically lithium orofate, why this is important? Lithium builds up and doctor will have you eat it for longer number of months to some years, until there is toxic lvl in body, then they cancel it, but you can but OTC lithium that works pretty much same, 20% weaker but this one is lithium carbonate and what's the main difference? They pump you with 70% more toxic lithium orofate at doctor's to save around cent on box of pills, then using the lithium carbonate, crazy part is it's a mg dosing as most pills, the box costs around 0.2 USD to make (trust me, taking few Gs of herb, and making few 100mgs of active compound at scale cost  nothing, but the box in my country costs from the doctor around 80 bucks to healthcare insurance, so they : 

Poison you with lithium orofate at production cost : 0,2 and retail for 80usd 

Even when lithium carbonate could be used, with need of 20% more mg, at savings of 0,01 at production makes 0,19 and at least here is sold OTC for under 18 bucks, is this crazy? 


And any biochem research starting point for research, testing could be made. 

Wow, now I forgot how much hours I write, it's nice to storytell and  thing about problems but not solve them to no end now, I feel like IAM cursed sometimes.. and I know I would continue to make world record of random themed longest reddit post, wait, what I may find for you in my drawer

I think for newer commers you can try your baby steps with 300usd and forever free 4 ocpus and 24 gb memory from Oracle company (I just didn't get to it fully, so here is there document: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm. ) 

And for yous with no need for cheap things, just notice not only deepseek R1 has 1.5b model so making low cost armyes will be EZY, but if R1 zero is gonna lead creative part, the command. The power should be better than Naruto's strike. R1zero is most likely most self aware and really inteligent model yet, but for the things they don't test and that's it's no fine tuning, the ai is like Brennan Savage without parents from being born, thrown to middle of Bahamas and being told to become best binary, hexadecimal coder, with procesor architecture spill, and trade algo, sound plugin meat beater king of hill, with a spade in hand and bucket for sand, rest assured none will move him closer to goal.

2 scratch - money to sleep 

Scratch (what I catched, 4 years no hear of this):
Anything I want I earn, 
Couple mill to invest in,
Focus on your biz,
For your shits,

Should you down for the money, 
IAM for the money, 

My part (beat syndrome battlefield, one také write, so won't fit sorry): 

Yeah for the 
For money I ve been wasting my time just to let that shit disappear
Into the thin air like smoke from the substance of the shaman 
I have been eating steak with fresh kilos of that veggie shit
Ohh the money that made so much of thems quit, trust, Split
Split second it takes to take one hit and be dead kid, leave the streets if you have no knife to att least MAKE A STATEMENT!
Thst girl said as a kid I locked her up, who knows why, why she went to my sweet basement, but kids playing thats just a way dad, Iam sorry, hopefully I did not rape her, did I? I DID NOT SO DONT CRY OVER SHIT YOU METH HEAD, that energy could be felt long before you knew what that thing is Kate, why you hatein, now IAM grown, took care of a woman, after few of them I took care of as well mam, notice how caring IAM THEN! 

After those woman used me for my income, should I change my goals that were ambicius, did my ex-wife the only one I loved loved back, who knows when she leaves because we crash In nice wooden cottage, small one at that, old and historical one as well but between millions of trees you woman! 
IAM angry soon to be slender man, the ones that will come close won't be more than friends and I will have personal EDEN
Shit coming from theire mouths is focused on themselves as much as sentence can take in

Take wondo of words, psycho tyranty from her man, I knew she's schyzofrenic and not just that yelled, what, who said yelled? SHE YELLED BY EMOTIONS , KEEPING FACE QUIETE SPEAKING WITH Power of that mage, that's bad for the team, devil, wait in my head someone said devil that's a bad placement, I worked on life, on biz and on her health and, when she misused her powers as a psycho/psychic she met my true, full, and purplish TOXIC WASTELAND you won't touch me girl I was accountant of the Satan

Still demonic power from within, with calling of Jesus I think but, when song Jesus to a child was last two songs on SoundCloud when I woke up from my own death man, 5 times lethal dose of euthanazing agent I made in hotels BASEMENT! 

They come, WHO? WHY TOU SAAAY THAT! Can I trust my hardwired atheism when Jesus wakes me up from coma followed by unelectrhfication of connex in hearth, then central nervous system shutdown and after this point, myiocard seizure or anything from long list of RUSSIAN RULLETE, And trust me, thst in 5 LAYERS LAYERS OF ABUSMENT PARK HELL DAAAAAM!! 

Then I wrote to those Saints of Jesus  ,Mormon fuck clan,  o response it seems, the kids of the one that give all, for his kids man, those kids fuck theire father wish as Jesus spend loads of energy to fix that from below the basement, energy seems to be wasted, on my wasteland of DEMONIC SATIRE, WHERE DARK FORCES WILL HELP ME IF I PRESS THE RED ONE, EITH THE PURPLE RING, I WAS DARK, SKINNY AS HELL, SATANS LEDT HAND, BLACK SMOOOTH FIRE AND CRUSTY DESTROYED SKIN, ALL IN BLACK LIKE AMG I WILL drive in the night if I press that red purple button with mammons symbol, as seen in the dream man, button will allow energy from my crazy setup of angels that should have supported my ways to heal, now this button focuses there energy thru me to my real supporters my demons, 

Now tell me how do you feel bruh, words come easy, but a spell bound seems to be block or who will tell me where this music ends, if it's late of if it only starts new way to describe this wrong chapter in the chronicles on the crazy man. 

THIS crazy man, liked music, was called psychotic and singed few times, like 400 songs kids, now emphasize or indicate how complicated this complication became, you in the story now uncovering each little detail, piece by piece dark magic here if thats what you wanted, that's destiny. 

When I called upon my demons, one time in life before, they BUILD A WALL FROM THE WAY BELLOW OF BASEMENT, china would be proud but they did not see that, trust me I got info the mafia that wanted me dead got somehow anonymous ,,sister,, that I hung myself and they should back up,wooooow, THATS WHAT MY INSIDER TOLD ME, but they did not killed me so that means it worked, now how to fix that

I wanna say I was making just waves, this life seems like a pain in the ass to be honestand if even with my outcries those aliens on this planet won't receive and respond to my call, stabbing, and then when coo comes, running to him like u unicorn, with a horn, held on forehead to be sure they approve, General the guy is a bad man, they said on the records he liked a bit of weed and made alarms sound in whole country because he tought some system is here to help him, in country with 40% people under power ty that crazy guy is holding a knife, making waves with left hand, right hand red and on spot where I can shoot and it would finally full his campaign for euthanasia, ROGER THAT, MAKE THYT BASTARD A HAPPY EUTHANASIA DAY, WAY NEVER INTENDED WITH COST OF LIIVES BUT THATS OVERSTATEMENT, HE KILLED HOMELESS WE MADE, so it's ok then

Heavy weights tell you a no importance of a glory, that past the fact that mountains don't protect anybody from government, those state dogs should never had money directly but look what we made, now humanity is gone and most people have no hand, they struggle next to warzone just to die eyyyy.

Thing is IAM not the one to be messed with until last point, the last dot of book I was writing but never will write it seems like then, what the gunpowder isade from? Sulfur mix with ash, then what it was again,ohh one can legally buy gunpowder, what about gun from my head then, unicorn with ball, a fireball running on just one leg, when knives will be shot down, explosion will be funnier that new years, where darkness overturned the world it seems like, all the us/Canada, us ending nato alience, and Izrael not selling to nato as well, what happens grandpa, what happens then?????? 

LET ME TRLL YOU NO GOOD WAY TO SAY THAT!!!! Nato was centre, nobody cared about much, but with no us and no Izrael most modern army systems where will we go? We gonna eat rocks I think like I will become like survival yes man, testing allways dangers of nature of it goes that way, options limited pressure is dropping, and I again got stuck working but o ly today feel happy, like I finished something, HARDCORE GAME ON

YOU DONT WANNA SEE ME UNDER PRESSURE, THE BY DOCTORS EXTREME, EXTRAVAGANT, PERSON SEARCHING FOR MOST EXTREME SCENARIOS ALL AT A BASE, THEN PRESSURE COMES AND I MOVE TO THE IMMORTAL CULTIVATORS OF UNIVERSE POWER, AND FROM THE ABOVE GOD CEOS OF UNIVERSE I GONNA 

GONNA GUNNA DOWN MAKING WHOLE ANOTHER CLOUD,
BLODY BLODY BLODY HELL, MAKING ME TO TASTE THE BLOD SMELL, IJ THE SIENCE NO WAY TO DROP LIKE IN THE MARIO, SEEMS LIKE GOING UP WAS JUST A WAY FOR UNIVERSE TO SAY THA KS FOR THE INDURED CRAZY RAIN OF BRAIN NEEDLES AND SATANIC KIND OF MANIAC SIMPLE WAYS. 

NOT MAKING THE HAZE, STILL KEPT IT SEMI LEGAL, BUT FROM CULTIVATORS POINT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL EHAT POLITIC IS WHAT AND THST MAKES THE JOB A BETTER SMELL, THEY ALL JUST CLAP WITH LIPS BUT COMING OUT IS NO WUALITY SOUND, BASIC 2HZ 1B QUALITY KIND OF SOUND IF I EVEN KNOW WHAT I SAY AT THIS STATE, FROM THE UNIVERSE THE DISPLAY SEEMS KINDA SMALL, WHEN ALL THE ALIENS HERE IN MY PETRI DISH CALLED PLANET COULD BE VINEGAR DEAD, IF I JUST SPIT THERE JUST A LITTLE SPIT. 

I allow you guys to use all of this for lmm, mml, llm, mlm, lml,LLM and even milf if needed to be, my today's token cap was reached. 
Time 0135 and IAM out, gen z and generated countent flow on me!

1ie2cpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1ie2cpg/seeking_advice_on_performance_cocktail/,"Seeking Advice on ""Performance"" Cocktail","My partner and I are putting together a cocktail tasting event featuring our specialty Kona Coffee Liquors, and we are trying to come up with one more ""performance"" style cocktail. The other performance cocktail we have settled on is a slightly modified Cafè Brûlot that we will serve with the whole show of pouring the flaming alcohol down the orange peel.

We are really excited about the reactions we expect to get from the Brûlot, and we are hoping that we can offer at least one more ""performance"" cocktail as part of the experience. However, we aren't very skilled with the whole flipping and spinning bottles and shakers thing, and unfortunately when I look online for other cocktails served with flair, that's all I'm finding. My partner does have bartending experience (and I've done ""beertending"") but neither of us picked up that type of skill.

We would really appreciate any suggestions. We want people to enjoy great drinks, have fun, and leave feeling like they definitely got their money's worth. And we want to have fun with it too! My partner's flair is going to match the Brûlot perfectly, and I'm hoping to find something I can do to add some extra special flair to the event as well.
