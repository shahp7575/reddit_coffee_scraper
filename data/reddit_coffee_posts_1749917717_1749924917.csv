1lbf770,https://www.reddit.com/r/Innovation/comments/1lbf770/my_favorite_gadget_lately/,My favorite gadget lately,"I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever be that person talking about an espresso machine. I‚Äôm the type who gets excited over a new chipset or a clever bit of UI not coffee gear. But then I stumbled across the outin portable espresso maker, and something about it just clicked.

Maybe it was the USB-C port. Or the fact that it charges like a phone and runs completely off a built-in battery. Whatever it was, it felt more like unboxing a new piece of consumer tech than a kitchen appliance. It heats its own water, generates enough pressure for a real espresso shot, and fits in my bag next to my earbuds and power bank.

The only thing missing? An app. And I can‚Äôt decide if that‚Äôs a flaw or a feature. Part of me wants to tweak settings or see battery stats on my phone. The other part kind of loves that it just works. No pairing, no notifications, no firmware updates, just coffee.

Anyway, I didn‚Äôt expect to write on a travel espresso machine. But here we are. It‚Äôs the little innovations that sneak up on you, do you guys have any favorite gadgets, I would love to explore them. ",1,1749924853.0,Innovation,0,1.0,False

1lbf48m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lbf48m,"14 Days (May 2025) - Seoul, Gyeongju, Busan","Hey folks - did a two week stay in South Korea from late May - early June (Seoul, Gyeongju, Busan). A lot of my itinerary was inspired by posts in this subreddit so wanted to share my trip report if it helps anyone else looking into a similar itinerary / travel style. This was a solo trip so I was able to travel the way I prefer - assume this'll be my only trip to the country so try and cover as many of the main attractions / big hits as possible. This'll involve a LOT of exploring and getting from place to place, and this was definitely a packed itinerary (walked 95 miles in 14 days). I don't regret how I approached this trip at all, just some of the things I did / didn't do. 

  
Will start with logistics and arrival first, then the itinerary, things I would've changed, and final thoughts! Ask me any Qs you might have!

# ‚úàÔ∏è Flights + Arrival

Flying out of Boston (US) to Incheon on a Friday morning and flying back on a Sunday evening two weeks later cost \~$1,400. I planned this trip on rather short notice (booked my flight 3 weeks before departure); I might've been able to get a cheaper flight around $1k if I booked months earlier. sI carried \~500k won with me ($350 US, rationing $25 a day) since I like having local currency ahead of arrival (ended up needing <half of this). 

When I landed in Incheon (6pm) customs was a breeze as there were more agents than people going through customs! I booted up my phone with the eSIM I bought ahead of time on Klook - $34 for 15 days with a local phone number. I wanted the local number in case I needed it for restaurant queues or any other SMS stuff, but I never ended up needing it (the two queues I did join allowed me to join via email). So feel free to get an eSIM for much cheaper without the local number. 

I walked over towards the airport exits near the airport limo buses and got a ticket from one of many kiosks. Paid with credit card to save my cash, and got on the bus to Myeongdong. Worth noting that I also should've gotten my WOWPass/T-money card at the airport, but it lapsed my mind to do so (will talk at the end about these two cards).  Didn't matter since I randomly found a WOWPass kiosk on the streets of Myeongdong the next day anyways. 

# üèôÔ∏è Days 0‚Äì2: Seoul (Myeongdong)

I stayed in a 'hostel' in Myeongdong (KPOP Hostel) a few blocks over from the night market - $160 US for 3 nights. Putting 'hostel' in quotes because it was more like a hotel since you got your own room. Room was simple (bed, TV, desk, bathroom) for what I paid which was good with me. Location was nice since it was a few blocks from the night market, easy walking distance to many of the big Seoul attractions, and was down the street from the train. What I did below:

**Day 0**

* (dinner) **Ssada Gimbap** \- tasty, cheap, open 24 hours, can order via kiosk (in English), and within the night market effectively
* **Myeongdong Night Market** \- explored after dinner. Fun to walk through all the stalls selling food and trinkets, the cafes, and the shops. What I learned is a lot of shops in Korea stay open until 10pm, and cafes until 12am (at least in the main trafficked areas) - common night routine for me would quickly become dinner -> shopping -> drinks/cafe/dessert. 

**Day 1**

* **Gwangjang Market** \- just walked through after getting breakfast at a local cafe. Most stalls weren't open since it was early (9am?). Made famous by Netflix featuring one of their stalls' kalguksu noodles I believe
* **Jongmyo Shrine** \- I got a combo pass for 5k won that had tickets for this and four of the 'Five Grand Palaces' since I was going to be visiting most of them anyways. This and the following 2 are basically next to each other
* **Changdeokgung Palace** 
* **Changgyeongung Palace / Secret Garden Tour** \- I signed up for the Secret Garden tour online ahead of time but you can easily snag a ticket day of if you show up a little bit before your desired entry time. Different entry times for different languages, there's a schedule online you can find. A beautiful and quaint royal garden that was quick to walk through. The guided tour of the garden lasts an hour but I just walked through on my own instead to save time 
* **Insadong Culture Street** 
* (lunch) ended up at a conveyer belt sushi place in the area because each plate was 2.2k won - insanely cheap to me. The fish was quality and I got to try beef yukhoe too which was delicious 
* (shopping) **Ssamzigil** \- small craft stores within its own large complex. Got a bunch of souvenirs here because I figured I wouldn't see a lot of the same stuff for the rest of my trip (which was correct). Was really intrigued by one stall selling handmade wooden watches that looked beautiful 
* **Gwanghwamun Square** \- public square with two massive statues dedicated to war hero Admiral Yi Sun-sin and King Sejong the Great. Also had an outdoor library with inflated chairs and carpeted tents you could chill in for free - astounding to me as an American. You could even grab a blanket for free and return it when done! At night they had musical acts performing too. Could easily chill here with a book / podcast / coffee for an hour 
* (shopping) **Seoul Sticker Shop** \- many different stickers by various local artists
* **Bukchon Hanok Village** \- didn't explore too much as it was \~6pm and a lot of the area is closed to visitors at 6pm to avoid disturbing the local residents. Holed up at a tea shop with a gorgeous view of the city and the mountains (Jeong's tea house)
* **Gyeongbokgung Palace (Night Viewing)** \- I showed up at 6:15pm after hearing the queue to get a ticket for the night viewing (7pm entry) would be long. The queue was long but I feel like you could show up at or even after 7pm and still be fine - I saw people walking up and getting a ticket when I was leaving at 7:45pm (though I believe it was because this walk-up ticket process was for foreigners only)
* (dinner) **Myeongdong Kyoja** \- famous place for noodles and dumpling, believe it's Michelin recommended. They have multiple locations within blocks of each other
* (drinks) **Ranch Brewing** / **Magpie Brewing** 

**Day 2**

* (breakfast) **Starbucks Jangchung Lounge R** \- a new Starbucks reserve location in a preserved home from the 1960s, it felt like I was walking into a millionaire's complex. Also had an expansive MINI display in the basement to celebrate their 20th anniversary of selling cars in Korea. They also sell alcohol! Gorgeous place and very glad I checked it out
* **Seoul Plaza**
* **Namdaemun Market**
* (lunch/dinner) **Hangaram** \- Got Ganjang-gejang (Raw crab marinated in soy sauce) here which was delicious. They give you so much banchan that this was the most full I was during the whole trip
* **Sungnyemun Gate** \- couldn't walk through it since it was closed as it was a Monday, but got to see it from outside which was perfectly fine
* **Seoullo 7017**
* **Namsan / Seoul Tower** \- original plan was to do the hour hike to the top but I had walked \~20 miles in Korea thus far so I decided to treat myself to the cable car ride up instead. Got here around sunset which was beautiful, and stayed until it got dark to see the entire city light up. Plenty of snacks/food options up here which surprised me
* (drinks) **Ggeek Beer Company** 

# üèôÔ∏è Days 3‚Äì4: Gyeongju

Took a KTX train from Seoul Station to Gyeongju (formerly Singyeongju, may still be called that at some kiosks). Important to note that you need to take a regular bus from the station to the main Gyeongju area. Stayed in a traditional Hanok for \~$40 a night which was cool. Gave me enough blankets + padding to where I was fine sleeping on the floor, and unexpectedly got a TV too which was an underrated benefit when I wanted to chill/recharge for 30 minutes. Loved getting away from the big cities and exploring the countryside with Gyeongju!

What I did:

* (breakfast) gimbap at the train station, there's several food stalls that sell good food meant to be eaten on the train which is convenient
* (lunch) **ÍµêÎèôÏßëÎ∞•** \- like a home cooked meal, delicious pork belly set for cheap
* **Gyochon Hanok Village**
* **Gyeongju National Museum** \- got there just as an English tour kicked off so I learned about the ancient Silla dynasty for \~30 minutes before splitting off
* **Cheomseogndae**
* **Daereungwon Tomb Complex / Cheonmachong**
* (dinner) **Sobakage** \- the best soba noodles I've ever had with torched pork belly that melted in my mouth. Came here on two days, it was that good
* (dessert) **From Sanglok** \- delicious choux, I got the Gyeongju Choux which had \~5 layers of matcha crust/red bean/cream/tapioca filling goodness
* **Woljeongyo Bridge, Donggung Palace / Wolji Pond** \- did these 3 at night which I highly recommend because of how they're all lit up. The best pictures I took this whole trip were here
* **Bulguksa Temple**
* (lunch) **Cafe OldCity** \- nice owner has 4/5 cats in a cute cafe close to the base of the temple
* (shopping) **ÎîîÏä§Î™®Î®ºÌä∏(thismoment**) - more unique souvenirs as I believe all the prints/art designs are made by the owner herself
* (shopping) **Hwangnidan-gil** \- main shopping street in Gyeongju
* (dinner) **ÏòÅÏñëÏàØÎ∂àÍ∞àÎπÑ** \- Korean BBQ option that doesn't mind solo diners! And they do hanwoo beef which is another delicious plus (believe it's between wagyu and kobe)
* (drinks) **Bar Boon** \- the best cocktail bar I've ever been to. Drinks are super creative and well made with many of their mixers being housemade. Staff speak fluent English and the owner is from California originally. When it gets too full they open their second location across the hall. Usually frequented by travelers so a nice place to trade stories too

# üèôÔ∏è Days 5‚Äì9: Busan (Seomyeon)

Took a KTX train to Busan. Got a super nice hotel room for $45 nightly and is easily the best bang-for-buck accommodation in all my travels. Seomyeon has so many hotels that you could get a nice room for cheap very easily. Stayed in Seomyeon because it was pretty central relative to all the activities I wanted to do in Busan. Seomyeon's usually thought of as a major shopping district which makes sense, lots of bar/food options too. 

**Day 5**

* **Seokbulsa Temple** \- multiple ways to do this, common to take train to the base of the temple and then cable car up to the start of a 1.5 hour hike. What I did instead was take a bus to an alternate starting point with a \~45 min hike up to the top instead. What I did not account for were the operating hours of the temple which closed at 4pm - I was less than pleased to discover this once I got to the top at 6pm :(
* (dinner) **Outdark Chicken House** \- really wanted some Korean fried chicken post hike so ended up here, massive platter of chicken and fries that I could not finish
* (drinks) **Hard & Heavy Rock Metal Pub** \- saw the pub while I was eating my chicken! Got 2 delicious Guinness drafts here and listened to some Metallica + Muse (you can request songs). They have a bunch of bottled beer options from around the world, and a lot of dope memorabilia/vinyl on display

**Day 6**

* **Gamcheon Culture Village** \- Haneul Maru Observatory probably has the best vantage point
* (lunch) Í∞êÏ≤úÏÇ¨Í≥®ÏÜåÎ®∏Î¶¨Í≥∞ÌÉï - delicious ox tail broth soup and dumplings 
* **Songdo Cable Car / Songdo Sky Park**
* **Songdo Yonggung Suspension Bridge**
* **Huinnyeoul Culture Village**
* **Sajik Baseball Stadium** \- wanted to catch a KBO game! Tourists basically can't buy tickets ahead of time so I got to the stadium \~75 minutes before game start to try and buy one. They have a few ticket kiosks at the base of the stadium (and a few information booths you can ask for help from too). Leftover tickets were selling at a decent pace so I'm glad I got here as early as I did, ended up three rows from 3rd base for \~$20 USD. Felt like it was 60% K-pop concert and 40% game in the best way possible - the energy was crazy! You can bring whatever food/drink into the stadium (people brought picnic baskets even), but there's plenty of cheap food options inside too. Got a massive box of Korean fried chicken for $14 USD and canned beer from a 7/11 inside for $2 USD - ridiculous considering a beer at a MLB game is $14

**Day 7**

* **Oryukdo Skywalk**
* **Igidae Coastal Trail** 
* **UN Memorial Cemetery**
* (shopping) **Lotte Department Store Gwangbokdong** \- mega mall with an incredible observatory rooftop
* **Gwangbok-ro Fashion Street**
* (dinner) **BIFF Square / Bupyeong Kkangtong Market** \- so many different food stall options and my favorite night market experience in Korea. BIFF Square has more of your typical night market food fare whereas Bupyeong had a lot more varied options 
* (drinks) **Galmegi Brewing**

**Day 8**

* **Haedong Younggungsa Temple**
* **Haeundae Blueline Park**
* (shopping) **Shinsegae Centum City** \- also got dinner here at a stand in the basement
   * I intended to do Spaland but they had to close early so I'd have to come back on Day 10 / Tuesday (closed Monday)
* (drinks) **Wildcat Brewing**
* (dinner) **Mom's Touch** \- wanted to get more food and had to try a Korean fast food chain. Delicious chicken burger

**Day 9**

* **Jeonpo Cafe Street** \- initially thought it'd be much larger/longer than it was, but felt like most of the activity was within a small 2x2 block grid
* (dinner) **Gijang Home-made Noodle** \- only has four dishes, usually getting the handmade kalguksu noodles here
* otherwise the entire day was just shopping in and exploring the general Seomyeon area 

# üèôÔ∏è Days 10‚Äì15: Seoul (Hongdae)

Took a KTX train back to Seoul! Important to note that I booked all my KTX tickets ahead of time online. I actually got to the station later than I thought I would and found out I could cancel + refund my pre-booked ticket very easily (minimal fee of 500 won), and then buy a new ticket for another train if seats were still available. Each day here is going to be in a different part of Seoul effectively. Homebase was a Vrbo in Hongdae for \~$45 USD nightly which was significantly cheaper than any hotel option in the area. Wanted to be in Hongdae for the shopping and food, both of which I planned to indulge heavily in. 

**Day 10** (Hongdae)

* **Spaland @ Shinsegae Centum City** \- finally did Spaland before leaving Busan! Explored both the gendered Korean bathhouse and the larger communal grounds too. So many different spa rooms at different temperatures, and the bathhouse had many pools at different temperatures too. I got a 30 minute full body scrub for \~35k won and I don't think I've ever felt cleaner in my life. They had a restaurant on-site which I got a delicious pork cutlet set meal from for lunch, though they also have a massive self-service ramen bar as well. Wish I stayed longer here
* (dinner) **Yeok Jeon Halmaek (Grandma's Beer)** \- frosty beer with good Korean bar food (I got scallion pancakes, pork belly, and fried chicken)
* (shopping) **AK Plaza Hongdae, Object, Mplayground, Ultravintage**
   * The rest of this trip is going to be shopping heavy. Would call out Object here as having a bunch of small cute items that I could've spent a lot of $ on if I didn't have self-control. AK Plaza has a big Sanrio cafe on one of its floors

**Day 11** (Seongsu)

* (breakfast) **Camel Coffee** \- almost like a coffee pop-up in an old Korean building. Delicious drink/pastry with a cool old-school aesthetic
* (shopping) **Common Ground Mall** \- Repurposed a ton of shipping containers into a shopping complex with a large central building. Bunch of vintage shops here (and the only vintage stores I bought anything from actually)
* **Seoul Forest Park** \- various areas within the park including an enclosed butterfly pavilion and large deer enclosure!
* (drinks) **Seoul Brewery Seongsu**
* (shopping) **Beaker, Coor, New Balance, AIR Vintage, eddybro house, Hatching Room, Musinsa Empty, Kith**
* (dinner/drinks) **Amazing Brewing Company**

**Day 12** (DMZ)

* **DMZ Tour** \- picked me up at 8am, dropped me off at City Hall at \~4:30pm. Very glad I did it since it'll be the only time you get any glimpse at North Korea. Tour guide was great. Obviously a tourist-heavy activity with many different tour groups so each area you go to will be swarmed with tourists. 
   * One of the best meals I had in Korea was actually a buffet lunch close to the edge of the DMZ past the passport check - simple home cooking of regular Korean dishes (could not get enough of both sweet and spicy pork belly with rice and the seasoned spinach banchan). 
* (dinner) **Longjiang Pig Trotter Rice** \- finally got some Jokbal
* (drinks) **Artmonster, Haroo Music Bar**

**Day 13** (Hongdae)

* (breakfast) **Starbucks Reserve Ewha University** \- first Starbucks location in Korea opened in 1999, many come here for the ability to engrave their tumblers/merch
* (shopping) **T1 Base Camp, thisisneverthat, ALand, ROOT Vintage, Musinsa Standard, Spao**
   * Calling out thisisneverthat as the store I bought the most things from, loved their selection
* (dinner) **Hongojib** \- wanted KBBQ again and this was one of few places open to solo diners
* (drinks) **Spill Out, Daejeon Brewery Yeonam Branch**

**Day 14** (Gangnam)

* (breakfast) **Coconutbox Cafe & Gallery** \- massive basement space with a ball pit for kids and several bungalows you can relax in with a coffee
* (shopping) **Pokemon Store Ìè¨ÏºìÎ™¨ÏΩîÎ¶¨ÏïÑ, Universe Gacha, Niceweather Seoul, Olive Young Gangnam Town, Fox Vintage**
* (dinner) **Mangwon Worldcup Market** \- wanted one last night market before leaving 

 

# üß≥ Final Notes / Thoughts

* You've heard of the T-money card, but maybe not the WOWPass. The WOWPass is for foreign travelers and doubles as both a debit card and T-money card. You can load cash on the card and transfer balances between debit and T-Money easily, which means you can use it to pay for basically anything you want to do. There's also discounts at various stores if you use the WOWPass. I grabbed mine at a random WOWPass kiosk I passed by next to a pharmacy - there's kiosks scattered throughout the city and at the airport. Super easy to use and is a better T-money card.
* Tax refund - some stores will give you the refund on the spot by taking it off your total, others will give you a receipt with a bar code to scan at the airport (or at a refund kiosk in the city). It's not a full refund so you'll only get a large portion of the tax back. Just remember to ask at checkout if they do tax refund and show your passport when you say it. Refunds are only on goods purchases > 15k won (so not on food). 
   * The entire process at the airport took maybe 15 minutes, they have a bunch of kiosks and I only had to wait behind 2 people. Still leave some time for it in case there's a lot of people doing their refunds. Advised to do it before you check any baggage in case customs officers need to inspect your luggage. 
* Cash - I brought 490k won with a 35k daily allotment. I only needed to use <half of it across my trip on T-money refills, night markets, and gacha shops. Nearly any other scenario you can use card at, even some of the market stands will take card too. Needed to use my cash more liberally at places I'd normally use card at to use it all. 
* Luggage - storage options are everywhere. Obviously the KTX stations and bus stations, and most of the regular train stations as well (especially the big ones like City Hall, Hongik Univ, the Euljiros). I used them frequently when buying things, in between accommodations, etc
* Transportation - I think 95% of the buses and trains I took had stop announcements in English which was not expected. Every bus stop had electronic displays showing how far away a bus was. Super clean and efficient transportation
* Apps - I only used Naver Maps, Papago, and Uber. Naver Maps is the Google Maps of Korea - Google Maps will not give you accurate directions. If you're looking for reviews / pictures of a place it'll be on Naver, Google might have a few but those will 99% be tourist opinions only. I still used Google Maps occasionally if I wanted to start searching there first (ex: for a brewery) before going to Naver.
   * Papago is apparently for more conversational Korean translations, but I used both Papago and Google Translate interchangeably.
   * I installed a few taxi apps (k.ride, Kakao T) but Uber worked fine. In Uber you can call taxis, Uber taxis, and regular Ubers. The price for a taxi in Uber vs the Korean apps was generally the same (sometimes cheaper too) so I stuck with the Uber app. Don't know the difference between calling a regular taxi vs Uber taxi in Uber, but they were always the same price.
      * **TAXIS ARE CHEAP.** Don't be afraid to call a taxi to save yourself 20 minutes of walking/travel time!
* Korea clearly still emphasizes the 'third space' with most cafes staying open past midnight, most shops staying open until 10pm, and street food stalls always having people late at night which I really liked!
* Fashion - Seeing the local fashion and how people dressed in Korea reminds me of how lazy we Americans can sometimes be and how our fashion is outdated by several years.
* Safety - South Korea is super safe. I'd often leave my belongings at a table and go to the bathroom with nary a concern. 
* City rankings - Busan > Gyeongju > Seoul. I loved the countryside / 'rural' aspect of Gyeongju and the different pace vs the big South Korea cities. I enjoyed Busan the most because I feel it took all the positives of Seoul and filtered out 30% of the occupancy. I'm from NYC and I love big cities, but even I felt like Seoul was a little too crowded at times. ",1,1749924637.0,koreatravel,0,1.0,False

Do you guys have any strategies or plans to combat cravings? I feel like whenever I string two or three good eating days together on the next day I have this huge craving and stuff my face. 

Obviously it makes me feel awful afterwards but it feels like a carnal impulse if that makes sense. Like I can‚Äôt stop myself from eating.

I‚Äôll explain what happened yesterday for more info:

Wake up, ate breakfast. Consisted of:
- 3 eggs
- Fried spinach
- two pieces of toast 
- little butter in the pan and on toast

Felt great and ready to take on another day. After I ate I did some yard work and that took me til around noon. So then I ate a nice caesar salad with chicken and croutons. I didn‚Äôt count sizes very well but it was a pretty well sized meal. (I figured the yard work allowed me to eat a wee bit more)

So all well and good so far. But then the problem: 

After lunch I had to go out and run some errands. This took me to about 6. As I‚Äôm driving home, I see the Tim hortons I pass by on the daily. I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from pulling into the drive thru and ordering a chocolate chip muffin and a medium coffee (2 cream 1 sweetener). All in all a small meal. 

That‚Äôs all fine and dandy I figure I‚Äôd eat a later dinner to compensate. Oh boy was I wrong. As soon as I got home I felt the unstoppable urge to get more food in me and I ended up eating way over what I should have. I‚Äôm talking Oreos, twizzlers, smarties the whole shabang. I usually keep snacks in my cupboard for my nephews but I slammed almost half my supply before I stopped binging. Add a bowl of cereal and leftover chicken stir fry (that was supposed to be for my lunch Monday) and I went over what I should have by tenfold.

I just can‚Äôt stop the damn urges and need to hear strategies to change them. I don‚Äôt know how to start and feel like it‚Äôs an addiction. It‚Äôs all so frustrating. 

Please let me know if you know how to get around the urges or at least lessen them. Thank you guys so much.

Its a really nice ceramic mug that my sister got me for Christmas with my name printed on it.

The problem is my coworker Sarah keeps using it even though she knows its mine. The first time I found her drinking out of it I politely told her it was my personal mug and asked if she could use one of the office cups instead. She apologized and said she didnt realize.

But then it kept happening. I would come back from lunch and find my mug in the sink dirty or sometimes still on her desk with coffee in it. Every time I brought it up she would say sorry and that she just grabbed the first mug she saw without thinking.

Last week I decided to keep my mug at my desk instead of leaving it in the kitchen area. I figured that would solve the problem since she would have to actually come to my workspace to take it. But yesterday I came back from a meeting and caught Sarah at my desk pouring coffee into my mug.

When I asked what she was doing she said she couldnt find any clean cups in the kitchen and knew I wouldnt mind if she borrowed mine real quick. I told her I did mind and that she needs to stop using my stuff. She got defensive and said it was just a mug and that I was being possessive over something so small.

Today I brought a different mug from home and hid my good one in my desk drawer. Sarah noticed and asked where my usual mug was. When I said I was keeping it put away she rolled her eyes and said I was being ridiculous about a piece of ceramic.

Now some of my other coworkers are saying I should just let her use it sometimes since we all share other things like the coffee maker and sugar. But I feel like bringing your own mug to work means its your personal property and people shouldnt just take it.

1lbewmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1lbewmc/tifu_followup_to_my_hair_dye_rant_disaster_my/,TIFU Follow-up to my hair dye rant disaster‚Ä¶ my friend got the best revenge,"So I posted yesterday about how I passionately ranted about how much I hate when men dye their hair right in front of my friend whose husband dyes his hair because she prefers it that way. Yeah. That one.

In case you missed it: I basically went off about how unnatural it looks, how men should embrace their grays, blah blah, aging is beautiful, etc.and then my friend hit me with, ‚ÄúI make my husband dye his hair.‚Äù I wanted to evaporate on the spot.

WELL.

After reading all the comments on my post (thank you, Reddit, for dragging me with grace), I decided to show my friend. I figured, why not? I‚Äôd already humiliated myself in real life might as well complete the cycle online.

So the next day, I sent her the post. And she LOST it.

Like, I have never seen someone laugh that hard in my life. Full-on wheezing. Tears. She texted back, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dying. You‚Äôre an idiot. But an adorable idiot.‚Äù

For a moment, I thought I‚Äôd been forgiven. Maybe even redeemed.

I was wrong.

We met for coffee later that afternoon, and she comes in with this sly little grin like she‚Äôs up to something. We sit down, and she goes, ‚ÄúSo since we‚Äôre sharing brutally honest, slightly unsolicited opinions‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always hated your asymmetric bob.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù

She sips her drink like a Bond villain and goes, ‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs just one of those haircuts that screams ‚ÄòI own crystals and yell at customer service.‚Äô‚Äù

EXCUSE ME?

I‚Äôve had this haircut for like four years. I love my asymmetric bob. It‚Äôs my ‚Äúquirky cool aunt‚Äù look. It‚Äôs me. And now she‚Äôs just casually telling me it‚Äôs been giving off chaotic divorced energy this whole time?

She kept going. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs a strong choice. But kind of intense. Like you might start a small cult or sue a Whole Foods.‚Äù

I was both speechless and wildly impressed by the specificity of the insult.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you say anything before?‚Äù I asked.

She shrugged. ‚ÄúBecause I love you, and I know you love it. But then you called my husband‚Äôs hair fake in front of everyone, so‚Ä¶ consider this my revenge.‚Äù

Touch√©.

It‚Äôs fair. I deserved it.

Honestly, it was kind of a perfect response. No drama, no argument, just a softly delivered truth bomb that absolutely took me out. I haven‚Äôt looked at my reflection the same way since. Now every time I catch a glimpse of my haircut, I wonder if I give off ‚ÄúCEO of Etsy shop that only sells sage bundles‚Äù energy.

Also, her husband? Still dying his hair. Still looking great. I fully support him now. I‚Äôve become a changed woman. Personal growth, courtesy of public humiliation.

TL;DR: Showed my friend the Reddit post where I trashed hair dye‚Äîshe laughed hysterically, then calmly told me she‚Äôs always hated my haircut. We‚Äôre even now. I think.",11,1749924099.0,tifu,5,0.87,False

I can't believe this moment is finally here. My SaaS product just made its first $100, and I‚Äôm over the moon in excitement.

A Little Backstory:
I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns üòÖ). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

But last night, as I was about to go to bed, I got¬†the notification.¬†You know the one ‚Äì ""You've received a payment of $19.‚Äù Although it didn‚Äôt seem like much, I checked my Stripe account and there it was, the big 100. It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does:
The product is a¬†Reddit marketing/growth tool¬†that helps people grow their product more on Reddit. It‚Äôs not a spam tool or anything like that, but it helps make the right type of posts so you can get some engagement, and it also has lead generation so you can find potential customers that way.
It‚Äôs aimed at small founders, businesses, marketers, and anyone who wants an easier way to grow on Reddit. And clearly, there‚Äôs at least one person out there who saw enough value to subscribe!

Why This Means So Much to Me:
I‚Äôm not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don‚Äôt have a fancy office or a huge team. It‚Äôs just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $100 is so much more than just money, it‚Äôs validation. It‚Äôs proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I‚Äôve built to actually pay for it.

What‚Äôs Next?
For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it‚Äôs time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let‚Äôs see how far this can go.
Thanks for reading, and if you‚Äôve been grinding on your own project, let‚Äôs hear about it in the comments. Let‚Äôs inspire each other.

&nbsp;




Ben stood at the edge of the wooded trail upstate. The wind moved lazily through the trees, stirring the yellowed grass and whistling against the rusted ‚ÄúNO TRESPASSING‚Äù sign nailed crookedly to the fence. The cabin beyond looked like it had been forgotten by the world. A quiet place. Secluded. Secure.

He was half-convinced this was a mistake. Not just coming here, but trusting any of what he‚Äôd seen in his fractured mind.

He didn‚Äôt remember the route, not exactly. He‚Äôd just‚Ä¶ ended up here. A string of half-recalled flashes and gut feelings had drawn him like magnets: a gravel road that bent the wrong way, a phone line that dipped too low, a faint scar of burn marks on a tree trunk. It was like following a ghost through fog.

He hopped the fence, landed light, and approached the cabin. Before he could knock, it opened. Slowly. Deliberately.

A woman leaned against the frame, balancing on a cane, her brow arched with surgical precision.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, voice dry and tinted with a Russian lilt. ‚ÄúPeter Parker. I was wondering when you would crawl out of the grave.‚Äù

Ben blinked. ‚ÄúYelena.‚Äù

She looked him over with sharp, unapologetic eyes. Her hair was bleached blond and chopped short, as if she had done it herself. One leg of her cargo trousers was neatly pinned up at the thigh, her prosthetic resting against the wall just behind her.

‚ÄúYou gonna keep staring at the leg?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúOr is that just how you flirt now?‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs face twitched. ‚ÄúSorry. I wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù

She stepped aside, limping slightly as she let him in. The inside was sparse but lived-in, feeling equal parts refuge and recovery ward. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and coffee. A cartoon played softly from another room, where a child‚Äôs laugh bubbled up, then faded. Ben looked into the other room to see another face he wasn‚Äôt expecting, but equally wasn‚Äôt too surprised to find here. Curt Connors, along with his wife and son. It made a shade of sense; he remembered how Alchemax‚Äôs meddling had brought him and the Widows together. 

Yelena followed, dropping heavily into an armchair and propping up what remained of her leg. Her movements were practised - not elegant, but efficient. She nodded toward the chair opposite her.

Ben sat, still uneasy. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you know I was coming?‚Äù he asked, before happening upon yet another lost memory. A strange one. ‚ÄúIs it that web‚Ä¶ thing? The way we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ connected?‚Äù

Yelena smirked. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúYou show up on my cameras limping through the woods like a confused puppy, I take notice.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Ben chuckled quietly, like it should have been obvious.

‚ÄúSo what brings you here?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúAnd why now, after so many years?‚Äù

Ben sat quietly for a second, considering how much to tell her. She seemed to already know that Peter Parker had been missing for the last few months, and so presumably she knew about the replacement Spider-Man swinging around Manhattan in his place. Which of the two did she think he was?

‚ÄúThis is gonna sound strange, maybe even insulting, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Ben took a deep breath. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I forgot. About this place, about you, until now.‚Äù

Yelena sat forward in her chair. ‚ÄúYou forgot?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor a while now, my memory‚Äôs been unreliable. Spotty,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúThings come back to me every now and then. Sometimes it‚Äôs random, sometimes it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs triggered by something. Like my brain‚Äôs rebuilding the connections.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike a web,‚Äù Yelena smirked. ‚ÄúSo, Peter Parker, what do you remember now?‚Äù

‚ÄúBits. Fragments. Enough to find you here. Enough to know you were there. On Alchemax Island.‚Äù

She snorted. ‚ÄúWe were all there. You took on Electro; Natasha, Ava, and I pushed deeper into the labs. Thought we could finish the job. Thought we were stronger than we were.‚Äù

Ben curled his hands curled into fists on his knees.

‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt prepared,‚Äù Yelena grimaced. ‚ÄúAva got separated. I lost my leg trying to escape.‚Äù

Ben grimaced. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen Ava since,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúNatasha‚Äôs convinced they took her; that‚Äôs she‚Äôs out there somewhere.‚Äù

He looked up sharply. ‚ÄúBut you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure.‚Äù Yelena leaned back, her face unreadable. ‚ÄúNowadays, Curt and Martha keep me company. He‚Äôs been helping me get used to my‚Ä¶ new normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd where‚Äôs Natasha?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs hunting. For Ava,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúFor wherever Alchemax could possibly be keeping her.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs mind raced. ‚ÄúDid you get anything from Alchemax Island? Any intel? Evidence?‚Äù

Yelena blinked. ‚ÄúNow you care?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny. After the island, you barely wanted to talk about Alchemax. Said you had other priorities. That you‚Äôd handle it if they ever made a move again. That we should leave them alone if they left us alone.‚Äù Her tone tightened. ‚ÄúNatasha hated you for that, you know?‚Äù

Ben shut his eyes. It didn‚Äôt make sense to him: Alchemax had his parents killed, they created the Green Goblin that almost destroyed Midtown High, they kidnapped and tortured him and experimented on him and countless others, including Dr Connors and the Widows. What could have possibly happened to Peter on Alchemax Island to convince him to put them so far out of his mind for years afterwards?

Then, while Ben searched for a memory that didn‚Äôt exist within his synapses, he happened upon something else instead. 

‚ÄúI remember something else,‚Äù Ben said, slowly. ‚ÄúSHIELD sent us to Alchemax Island. To collect dirt. Get evidence. Something they could use to shut Alchemax down.‚Äù

Yelena shrugged. ‚ÄúYeah. And what? That was the mission.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd they said we had to be careful, that we were likely to run into Miles Warren while we were there.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs chest tightened. The silence pressed in.

‚ÄúMiles Warren‚Äôs just another dime-a-dozen Alchemax scientist.‚Äù Yelena shook her head. ‚ÄúWhat makes him so important?‚Äù

It was something Ben couldn‚Äôt share - not until he was sure. Warren said it himself when he appeared in Ben‚Äôs apartment months ago: he was a master of genetic manipulation, and they had met before, even if Ben didn‚Äôt remember it. 

Warren denied being the one to create Ben, saying he wished he had and calling him ‚Äòa far more interesting specimen‚Äô. But he could have easily been lying.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve been so distant,‚Äù Ben said to Yelena. ‚ÄúAnd thank you. You‚Äôve helped me more than you realise.‚Äù

Yelena furrowed her brow. ‚ÄúWith what?‚Äù

‚ÄúFiguring out who I am.‚Äù

Ben moved back towards the door. Yelena stopped him. ‚ÄúWhen will we see you again?‚Äù

He looked forward at the uncertain future ahead of him, and then back at her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù


&nbsp;

üîπüï∏Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏èüîπ

&nbsp;



The woods fell away in the rear-view mirror, swallowed by distance and dusk. Gravel cracked beneath the tires as the road unwound ahead of the truck. Night hadn‚Äôt yet come, the sky instead painting blood orange. The engine rattled awake. His breath fogged faintly on the inside of the windscreen, despite the heat. There were no other vehicles. No headlights. Just trees and the endless stretch of tarmac and his own reflection in the rearview. Ben leaned into the drive, watching the road like it might offer clarity.

That was when it hit.

The Spider-Sense came first. A white-hot scream of danger in his skull.

Ben slammed on the brakes, tires screeching as the truck fishtailed. A shadow hurtled toward him, dropping from the treetops like a missile. The windshield exploded inward as something massive crashed onto the hood.

*Wham.*

The truck tipped. Ben barely managed to dive out as it flipped, the world turning sideways in a storm of metal and shattered glass. He hit the ground hard and rolled.

When he looked up, it was already standing over the wreckage. Eight feet tall. Plated in segmented armour that shimmered green-black under the light. It looked like something dredged up from a nightmare: not a man, not quite a machine. The tail behind it wasn‚Äôt just long - it was a weaponised, multi-jointed appendage of hellish precision, whirring as it curled above the creature‚Äôs back.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming with me, Spider-Man.‚Äù*

Ben was on his feet in an instant. ‚ÄúJesus. Who the hell are you supposed to be, the world‚Äôs angriest lobster?‚Äù

The creature lunged.

Ben ducked just in time, the tail slicing through air where his head had been. He hit the gravel and sprang up, launching himself toward the trees. He needed space, room to manoeuvre. Whoever this was, they weren‚Äôt some street-level thug; he was trained, precise, and that tech wasn‚Äôt off the shelf.

Ben fired a web to the nearest tree, swung wide and came back in fast, aiming a kick at the figure‚Äôs jaw. It landed with a satisfying crack. But the Scorpion barely staggered.

The tail came at him again. Ben flipped over it, shot a web to the armour‚Äôs joint, and yanked‚Äîtrying to unbalance him. No dice. The tail simply counter-pulled, nearly wrenching Ben‚Äôs shoulder from the socket.

Then it stabbed forward.

Ben dodged left, barely avoiding the needle-tipped end. It punched into the ground, hissing, steam rising. Venom or a sedative - meant to disable, not kill.

‚ÄúSHIELD, I‚Äôm guessing?‚Äù Ben panted, trying to get a better angle. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt their operatives normally more family-friendly looking?‚Äù

The man said nothing. The tail lashed again. Ben grabbed it mid-swing, but it was like trying to wrangle a live wire. He planted his feet and used all his strength to pull it forward, then yanked hard. The Scorpion stumbled, just for a second, and Ben sprang forward, webbing the enemy‚Äôs visor to try to blind him.

The moment was too short. The tail whipped around, caught Ben in the ribs. Pain exploded through his side. He flew through the air and smashed into the trunk of a tree.

He tasted blood.

No time.

The tail reared back. Ben tried to move but his limbs were sluggish. A web line fired wide. His vision blurred.

Then, sharp pain. Something plunged into his side. Cold. Immediate.

He looked down and saw the tail retracting, a slick syringe retracting from its tip.

Ben staggered forward, trying to focus. The trees doubled, then trebled.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù

The Scorpion stepped toward him. A silhouette against the night. Towering. Unstoppable.

*‚ÄúRest up,‚Äù* the voice said, mechanical, detached. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a lot of questions to answer.‚Äù*

Ben‚Äôs knees buckled. The world spun. The last thing he saw was the wrecked truck, flipped and smouldering like some distant memory.

Then everything went black.



&nbsp;

üîπüï∏Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏èüîπ

&nbsp;


He didn‚Äôt dream; he remembered.

Memories cracked through his skull like lightning, jagged and bright and full of pain. He was Peter Parker, still in high school, strapped to an operating table out of sight in Oscorp Tower. The restraints dug into his wrists. His skin stung where electrodes had been glued. Cold metal against warm flesh. Voices all around. Clinical. Curious. Cruel.

*‚ÄúElevated gene expression remains stable under strain‚Ä¶‚Äù*

*‚ÄúSubject‚Äôs vitals spiking‚Äîadminister suppressant.‚Äù*

A syringe. Screams. His screams.

They were carving him up for answers, desperate to understand why the Monarch formula had worked so well on him when it had failed in so many other subjects. Why the spider had rewritten him so perfectly.

When Ben Reilly opened his eyes, he was drenched in sweat. His breath caught in his throat like a sob.

He wasn‚Äôt back there. Not exactly.

The chamber around him was dark, silent but for the hum of electricity through hidden conduits. No restraints this time, just a bare bench beneath him, cool to the touch. His heart thundered in his chest. He sat up slowly, legs trembling beneath him as he stood.

In the shadows, a figure stirred.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while, Spider-Man.‚Äù

Nick Fury stepped forward, his figure unmistakable. The coat. The eye. The quiet weight of authority and regret.

Ben‚Äôs hands curled into fists. ‚ÄúYou drugged me. Had your pet Scorpion stick me like a lab rat.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a lab rat,‚Äù Fury replied calmly. ‚ÄúNot to us, anyway. But you are an asset. And it‚Äôs time you started acting like one.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúIf this is about Hobgoblin, I don‚Äôt know where he is. I don‚Äôt know what happened after the fight. I don‚Äôt know anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about Hobgoblin,‚Äù Fury replied plainly. ‚ÄúAs much as Barton and Gargan were left to believe.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what the hell is it about?‚Äù

Fury sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúYears ago, after the Oscorp raid, I told you that on your eighteenth birthday, I‚Äôd be claiming you as the SHIELD asset he was. Obviously, that didn‚Äôt happen. Things changed.‚Äù

Ben didn‚Äôt speak. His throat was still raw.

‚ÄúBut now,‚Äù Fury continued, ‚Äúafter everything that‚Äôs happened - the city on fire, the disappearances, Spider-Man‚Äôs vanishing act during the worst of it - we‚Äôre done waiting.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs voice was flat. ‚ÄúYou think Spider-Man needs a leash.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think he needs guidance,‚Äù Fury corrected. ‚ÄúStructure. You‚Äôve been flailing in the dark since the day you got bit, Parker.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs laugh came bitter and sharp. ‚ÄúYou really think I‚Äôm him?‚Äù

Fury blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the wrong guy,‚Äù Ben said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Peter. I‚Äôm a clone. The real Peter Parker went missing almost a year ago. He‚Äôs the one who fought Hobgoblin, not me. And that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt remember it, because I wasn‚Äôt there.‚Äù

Silence stretched. Fury‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change, but something in his posture shifted. An almost imperceptible slackening.

‚ÄúOh, kid,‚Äù he said at last, with something almost like pity. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got it backwards.‚Äù

Ben stared at him, a cold weight forming in his gut.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Fury stepped closer. Slowly. Carefully. Like approaching a wounded animal. ‚ÄúThe Spider-Man who‚Äôs been running around the past five years, the one who went missing? That‚Äôs the clone.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs heart dropped.

‚ÄúYou,‚Äù Fury said, ‚ÄúMr Parker‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre the original.‚Äù

Ben didn‚Äôt speak. His mouth opened, then closed, his jaw tight with a pressure he couldn‚Äôt release. The chamber felt like it was closing in on him. The shadows, the stale air, the metallic scent of his own sweat - he could hardly breathe. Not from pain. From something worse.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying,‚Äù he said. It came out quiet, hollow.

Nick Fury took a single step forward, just enough for the low light to catch the edge of his face. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your problem. You want this to be a lie.‚Äù

Ben backed away, his legs trembling. He wasn‚Äôt sure when he‚Äôd stood up. He just knew he couldn‚Äôt stay still. Couldn‚Äôt bear to be in the same space as this truth. He pressed his palm to the wall as if he needed to feel something real. But even the wall felt like it might dissolve.

‚ÄúAll this time‚Ä¶‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúAll this time I thought I was the copy.‚Äù

Fury stepped forward. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve known for a while. The Amazing Spider-Man everyone‚Äôs come to know was one of Alchemax‚Äôs. Just like the Scarlet Spider out in Boston. We were biding our time -  figured he‚Äôd break bad eventually, show his true colours. Give us the excuse we needed to shut Alchemax down for good.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs breathing was sharp now, more like panting. The flashes came in hot and sickening: metal restraints biting his wrists, harsh lights above him - except that wasn‚Äôt Oscorp, like before. This was Alchemax Island. 

‚ÄúBut he never cracked.‚Äù Fury almost laughed. ‚ÄúThe clone was perfect. Heroic, noble. Selfless. Just like you, Mr Parker.‚Äù His tone cooled. ‚ÄúAnd maybe that‚Äôs the irony. That the real one‚Ä¶‚Äù he gave Ben a hard look ‚Äú...ended up like this. Battle-scarred. Haunted.‚Äù

A table. Cold metal restraints. Faces behind glass. Instruments digging into his flesh. The sound of a woman screaming. A man laughing. 

Ben forced a breath through his teeth. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

Fury didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúBecause they were hunting you. Kravinoff and his freakshow. Oscorp couldn‚Äôt explain you, and Alchemax couldn‚Äôt reproduce you. They needed the source. So they made their own clone - the Scarlet Spider - but his body didn‚Äôt contain the answers they needed. They needed yours. Then one day‚Ä¶ they found you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlchemax Island‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, not to Fury but to himself. ‚ÄúThey tortured me. They ripped me apart and stitched me back together.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd to make sure no one came looking, they let their latest clone loose,‚Äù added Fury. ‚ÄúThey let him think he was Peter Parker. Let the world believe it. And just to be safe, they incepted just one directive. One little nudge.‚Äù

Ben didn‚Äôt want to say it. But the words pushed themselves from his mouth like bile.

‚ÄúTo keep away from them,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother Alchemax‚Ä¶ unless they bother you.‚Äù

Fury nodded, solemn now. ‚ÄúThe clone didn‚Äôt even question it. That‚Äôs how good the programming was. Kid probably didn‚Äôt even know.‚Äù

Ben stood there, shaking. Not from fear. From grief. The revelation hadn‚Äôt knocked the wind out of him, it had hollowed him. He stood in the low blue glow of the chamber, hands limp by his sides, mouth parted in disbelief.

Five years.

Not dreams. Not hallucinations. A web of memories that felt like they belonged to someone else, but were in fact his the whole time. 

It was his life. He was Peter Parker.

‚ÄúI disappeared,‚Äù Ben said. ‚ÄúThey replaced me. And no one noticed. Not even May.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey noticed,‚Äù Fury said. ‚ÄúThey just didn‚Äôt understand what they were seeing.‚Äù

This revelation didn‚Äôt settle like it should have. It scraped like glass in his chest. All he could see was Peter. This apparent clone. Not an Alchemax weapon, but Peter Parker. Laughing, hurting, shouldering the weight of the city like it was his birthright. And somehow, through all the grief, the only thing Ben felt was‚Ä¶ guilt.

He swallowed, voice thin and cracked. ‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ he thought he was me.‚Äù

Ben stepped back, unsteady. His thoughts returned to Alchemax Island. He remembered what Miles Warren had said to him.

*‚ÄúConsider yourself lucky. I don‚Äôt need you for any more experiments. I already know everything I need to know.‚Äù*

The only reason they hadn‚Äôt hunted him down and dragged him back to Alchemax Island, why they allowed him to sit in the shadows as an amnesiac spare part while another Spider-Man presided over the city, was because they were done with him. He had served his purpose. 

‚ÄúYou knew,‚Äù Ben said. Not a question. He could barely hear his own voice over the pounding in his ears. ‚ÄúYou sent me to Alchemax Island in the first place. How long did it take you to figure out what Alchemax had done?‚Äù

The shadows hid Fury‚Äôs face, but not the truth. Ben could see it in his stillness even before he spoke. ‚ÄúWe monitored the situation. That‚Äôs our job. We had intel that Osborn‚Äôs file on you was incomplete - someone had tampered with it. We knew about the Scarlet Spider from yours and Nova‚Äôs escapades, so we knew cloning was a possibility, then when Spider-Man got quiet about Alchemax‚Ä¶ refused to cooperate with us‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt track.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou knew where I was the whole time, what they‚Äôd be doing to me,‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúAnd you never came for me!‚Äù

The words cracked through the air like a whip. Fury‚Äôs jaw tightened. He looked older than Ben remembered - weathered, tired.

‚ÄúWalk away, Parker,‚Äù Fury said quietly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre free to go.‚Äù

That did it. Ben‚Äôs fists clenched at his sides. ‚ÄúYou kidnapped me. Drugged me. Threw me into a concrete cell. And all of it was just so you could blow my life apart? To dump this truth on me after sitting on it for years?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause, for all he did for this city the last five years, the clone is gone now,‚Äù said the SHIELD director, meeting his eyes now. ‚ÄúNow the city needs you. The original Spider-Man. The one still with skin in the game. The one who‚Äôs owed this.‚Äù

Ben shook his head. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did an upstanding job,‚Äù Fury said. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs off the board now. And, fortunately, we didn‚Äôt need to do anything to make that happen.‚Äù

Ben took a breath. Fury kept talking like it was simple, like it was strategic.

‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt last forever. That directive - ‚Äòdon‚Äôt bother Alchemax‚Äô - would have become a problem for all of us the second Alchemax starts making moves again. And they will.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs heart ached. He thought of Peter again - not a mistake, not a proxy, but a person. Then, he realised he was a fool. All this time, he had been asking himself what could have possibly triggered Peter to up sticks, start over and abandon his whole life, the life Ben wished was his. Now, Ben realised the answer was staring him in the face the whole time, because it was the same thing that caused Ben to make the same decision. The floor dropping out from beneath you, learning that your whole identity, your whole life, was built on a lie. 

‚ÄúGod,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúHe must feel like‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs lost everything.‚Äù

Fury gave no answer.

Ben turned to the door. Every part of him wanted to stay, to rip SHIELD apart from the inside. To force its director to hurt the way he hurt. The way the other Peter Parker must also have been hurting.

But he didn‚Äôt.

Instead, he walked away.

*Chapter 1: Light Work*

I've lived in SWFL my whole life. Halfway between wild and urban. Opulent and shabby. Mansions and crack dens. Beachfront and deep swamp. You don't realize how rich some people are until you drive through some of these subdivisions in Naples. All that money, and unless you're a talented bartender, it doesn't quite trickle down, especially in September. In Florida, our only two seasons are hurricane and tourist. So, this past month, when the market decided to take a shit, I decided it was time to find a second job. 

""Isaiah Combs 8-10 Live"" An A-frame blackboard sign read outside the only barren bar on the bustled street. I lugged in my PA, eyes darting from the marble bar top, bleach-white walls, and in stark contrast to the more fashionable nature of the rest of the bar; metal signs, with messages printed reading ""If you ain't fallen over yet you need another beer!"" and ""If beer isn't the answer you're asking the wrong question!"" that would be more at home in your boomer uncle's man cave that he fully furnished with Temu and Hobby Lobby. 4 or 5 years ago someone cared about this place. Had an elegant vision of a locale with all the class of a 5-star hotel lobby bar. That was until a new owner or manager, what have you, said to themself ""This is not what bar look like! Bar have pool table and dart board!""

My eyes met the bartender's and I saw the look in his eye before I saw him. He didn't want to be here as much as I did. He couldn't be much older than me, late-20s black button-down with a black tie. I wasn't sure if my polo was out of place yet.

""Can I help you with something, man?"" He had an accent to his voice I couldn't place outside of being European. 

""Yeah, I'm Isaiah, I'm playing here tonight. Liza didn't tell me where she wanted me to set up over the phone."" 

The bartender gestured to the vacant floor space in front of the touchtune, next to an ornate vintage wine cabinet. I bent my knees and carried my speakers to their destination. I could see a line on the floor where the linoleum was faded. Separated only by the black gunk from where a runner rug used to be duct taped down and no one thought it would be a good idea to spray some goo-gone before the tracks of months to years worth of patrons made it a permanent fixture of this hodgepodge. 

I finished setting up in record time as there were no drunks giving me the ""I'm gonna shout Free Bird as loud as I fucking can in about 10 to 15 minutes"" stare. No drunks or anyone for that matter. Just me and Bartender, he told me his name but for the life of me, I couldn't piece together the noise he made in a way that made sense phonetically. 

I jammed there by myself for an hour, an old man shuffled in looking for the bathroom. My tip jar remained as dry as a flood-controlled swamp. The calloused skin on my fingers flaked off with each successful chord change. The clock drudged forward getting closer to 10 pm. By this time a regular was seated at the far end of the bar away from me. I rigged up my harp rack with a G Harmonica to play Seminole Wind. 


When I was a little kid my dad used to take me on expeditions out in the Everglades. He had this story he told me about the skunk ape, basically South Florida's version of Bigfoot. I ate that shit up. We would pack a sack with bologna and cheese sandwiches, Deep Woods Off with 40% DEET, flashlights, binoculars, fishing gear, and the whole nine yards to go spend the day cavorting out in the swamp searching for signs of the elusive creature. The 2001 Saturn Vue hit Alligator Alley like Magellan on the high sea. Uncharted paved territory as waves of yellow, orange, and pink strobed between the trees in the early hours of daylight. The summer heat cascaded over our skin as we sat, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, under a cypress tree and enjoying our lunch that day. We never had any luck, I'm still hopeful there's stuff like that out there though. I've always had a fascination with the strange but I'm rational. I know there's likely no Bigfoot, skinwalkers, or most cryptids. Then again, if there are any out there it's just a part of nature we haven't found yet. Nothing really supernatural about it. 

That doesn't stop me from being cautious when going out on trails though.
My phone rang. It was Harry. He was the one who got me this shit gig, but hey, at least I would walk home with two hundred and fifty bucks. Harry had recently been promoted to good friend after spending quite some time in the acquaintance-zone. Everyone has quirks and flaws but sometimes, Harry was a bit to stomach.

""Yooo big dog!"" Harry called out from my phone, ""How's the Hideout? Makin' stacks?""

""Not particularly, there's one dude here and he hasn't taken an eye off his beer since he sat down like 10 minutes ago."" I leaned against the wall separating the out-of-order men's room and ladies' room as my iPad ran the show.

""Mannn, that sucksss dude. If I'm gonna be honest I do not like Liza. Bitch vibes.""

""Yeah, I don't know dude,"" I remembered the old guy from earlier and wondered if he used the women's restroom.

""Oh bro bro, before I forget. You're still looking for something steady right?""

Harry was about to save my ass again. ""Dude, I'm always looking, what do ya got?""

""Okay, so my uncle's friend or something right, he was chilling and told me he needed some extra help at some wildlife sanctuary or nature trail type shit.""

""What type of work?""

""Bro bro bro, it's nothing. It's a big animal research center in the middle of fucking nowhere and they just need a guy.""

""A guy to do what?""

""Men shit. Watch the place, pick up heavy things when they got em. Like security and stuff mostly.""

""This place is just in the middle of woods somewhere?""

""Yeah bro, security on that place is easy money dog. Deep out in Fakahatchee or Picayune I think. There's no one for miles, you just gonna be on the radio like 'uuhh there's a bear, and nothing else' and that's a band!""

The man on the other end of the bar began a coughing fit. The bartender didn't so much as look up from his phone. I squinted through the dimly lit bipolarly decorated room to see he was wearing AirPods.

""Harry, text me your uncle's cousin's roommate's number please.""

""Type shit. Let me know if Liza gives you shit tonight, she stiffed me last week.""




*Chapter 2: Naithlorendum*

Monday afternoon I drove out to the Gore Research Center. This place was in the boonies. There's a funny thing about Florida. It's similar to how the rest of the country is, just shrunk down and set the dial from low to high. Most of the people are on the coast and that's where all the money is. But you drive like 25 minutes and might as well be in Louisiana. I live about 10 minutes from one of the Bidens and another 20 minutes from there my dad found an upturned skiff housing a bale of marijuana. I didn't know they came in bales. Word of the wise, never try to stab one of those thinking you might just take a little bit. Those things are super compact. They had prison crews cleaning up for a couple of days.

I had been driving to meet the woman in charge of the facility for about 30 minutes now. Sedan was not the vehicle for the job. It had rained about four days ago, which was uncommon that time of year. The relative dryness was in my favor. I turned right off Golden Gate Parkway to head deep into the Picayune Strand State Forest. On Desoto, traffic slowly waned as the roads fell into disrepair. Homes that scattered the county road became less and less common. Less and less kept. American flags turn to Trump flags. Trump flags turn to rebel flags. Rebel flags turn to trees. 

After a few miles passed, I came upon a road sign. 

‚ÄúEnd County Maintenance.‚Äù  

*Thud.* The car lurched from the asphalt to the cruel limestone sand and dirt, throwing a cloud behind me as I vibrated down the landscape.

A majority of the journey had become unpaved. I had never been out that way. There's an almost unending maze of lefts and rights out there. RV's parked out in the middle of clearings, doing God knows what, strange wooden encampment suspended between the trees. I passed a dead deer around 130th Ave. 

I pulled up to the gate about two hours before sunset. My battle-weary Hyundai splattered with mud, dirt, and grime idled waiting for the gate to open.
I checked my messages with the contact I was given. Not delivered. I had one bar of LTE this far out which honestly surprised me. I sent a new message informing her I was outside. In wait, I took stock of my surroundings. 3 Signs on a post reading:

‚ÄúNo Trespassers KEEP OUT‚Äù

""Naithloriendum Wildlife Sanctuary""

And the third, ""Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? Ecclesiastes 7:17""


It was only a few moments before the front gate roared into life. 
The house was something out of Swiss Family Robinson. Towering on all sides were live oaks, cypress, and ficus trees. The unkempt driveway led to a winding staircase encroached on by a strangler fig. Jasmine vines climbed the banister on the front porch up to the second floor, its wilted white flowers speckled on the duff. Spanish moss covered the trees and shrouded the home drawing the eye to an observation deck on what looked to be the third floor. It was as if nature was reclaiming what was once hers.

She must've been in her early 60's. The gray roots just creeping up from her tightly packed jet-black hair. ""Isaiah, so good to see you!"" She called out from the front door. Her voice was much louder than you'd expect for the distance between us. I had to match the energy, ""Deb! Nice to finally meet in person!""

Feeling some sort of need to take control of this altogether new setting I found myself in, I quickly closed the distance between her and I. Scaling the derelict staircase with a hand outstretched. My enthusiasm, to me, felt outside the bounds of societal convention. The gentle breeze against my palm, as I swung it ahead, made it all too clear that clammy beads of sweat had formed. 

""Come in son, I'll let you get your bearings."" Deb showed me inside an immaculately clean house. House is the wrong word. It was unlived in. No utilitarian furnishings like TVs or kitchen appliances outside of a coffee maker seated on the welcome desk. Above the desk, there was a portrait of a smiling white-haired, bearded old man, with a golden retriever, seated on the front step of the old staircase. Before the strangler fig made its debut.

Deb tossed her jean jacket onto a coat rack by the front door and turned towards me clasping her hands together and teetering from heel to toe. ""Well! Welcome to the education center. This is, of course, Dr.Bob's former home. We do tours, and craft days, and uh the occasional field trip. Well. Un-occasional. It's a bit- just a bit far and obscure and too much of a negative connotation for the schools you know. Anyway! That doesn't stop any of the great work we do!"" Deb's eyes lit up at this. 

""So this is a uh conservation collier restoration site. Basically we are working to uh return this area to its natural habitat. This is a cypress hardwood, damn no it's a uh, hardwood, cypress, swamp, forest. Hardwood cypress swamp forest. While being both in the Picayune Strand we are also smack dab in the middle of uh Big cypress's Critical Area of State Concern."" Deb made her way to the rear of the house, passing photographs and newspapers strewn along the wall captioned like it would be at a museum.

""We work to create awareness and of course have boots on the ground here"" She spun to look at me. ""During the day."" She spun back. ""We document tree growth, panther population, water quality, you name it. The further people are from these uh vital environments the more they tend to do well. Flourish.""

We crossed a corridor, sealed by a red velvet rope and two greening, once golden stanchions. I peeked inside seeing one of those wheeled step ladders you see in old libraries. I adjusted my gaze back toward her, ""Keep Florida wild!"" I chimed in.

""Exactly! Yes, that's so good. I like that.""

I felt bad that I was just repeating some Instagram caption I had seen. We both stood there for a moment. I just smiled and nodded through the silence.

""OH,"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together once more. ""W-9 and stuff I'll drop by when I um come to meet you in the morning. Let me show you a little bit around here now."" She made an about-face towards the front door.

""This was Robert's entertaining area. It was used only by him though. Little to no visitors, those who knew him described him as a bit of a curmudgeon. Eccentric too."" She led me to the front reception, and again I saw posted above the door the word ""Naithlorendum""

I grabbed my phone from my pocket to google it. Just as we're rounding the desk to  climb up a second-story staircase Deb interrupts.""Most of what you will need you can find in or under here. Including a charger."" She grabbed the lightning cable and handed it to me. ""Thanks""

""Ab-so-lutly! Now follow me up here and I'll show you some of the exhibits."" As Deb grabbed the guard rail to the staircase she knocked on it three times. We ascended and the age of this building began to show, the air got more still and I could smell the faint nostalgic aroma of mildew. The musty air swirled in vapors as Deb reached for a brittle yellowed light switch at the top of the stairs. ""*Click*‚Äù 		

Nothing.

""This damn-"" She flicked it on and off three times and the overhead fluorescents buzzed, spattered, and awoke with all the vigor of a model T. A taxidermied bear, a few wild boar, a buck and a doe, a bald eagle, gopher tortoises, and a few otters in a menagerie of nature frozen in death. The wall to the left had a nearly 6-foot-long tarpon. 

Deb pointed to the bald eagle ""Don't worry, that's incredibly old."" She must've misinterpreted the bewildered look on my face for concern. Deb went on to explain some of the origins of the animals, or fun facts, or something while I took steps to mentally document my surroundings. Further on into the upstairs, there was a door. Plain wooden door with a black painted profile of a wild hog. I made my approach.

""That's the Pig Room."" Deb plainly stated in monotone.

Instinctively I almost blurted out ""The fuck?"" But I caught myself when I turned and faced this short kind-eyed woman who just so happened to be my new boss.

""Pardon""

""The Pig Room""

""Is that-""

""Exactly what you think it is? Yes""

Well, fucking thank you, Deb. I have not a clue in the world what the hell that means. She misread my expression again. She charged forward and opened the door. 

Frankly, there isn't anything I would have called it outside of the Pig Room. Speckled shadows crept through the doorway. A curtained window obscured by the mess of jasmine outside was the only light source. Deb trodded to the center of the room and pulled a cord. Illuminated now was a man's life's work. Glass cases and dioramas. Jars and diagrams. Sketches, notes, photographs, and all dedicated to the pigs. 

There was an old padauk wood bookcase brimmed with a dozen or more jars of fetal pigs suspended in formaldehyde. On another shelf, there were books like ""The Merck Veterinary Manual Eleventh Edition"" bound in navy canvas with silver foil lettering. Another read ‚ÄúThe Embryology of  The Pig Second Edition,‚Äù with a maroon cover and gold foil emboss. The other shelves were dotted with body parts, trinkets and journals; including a crate filled with 30 to 40 boar tusks. Tacked to the wall was a photocopy of a textbook that read ""Chapter 7 The Structure of Embryos from Nine to Twelve Millimeters in Length,"" on the second page was a diagram of a curled and squashed mass. Little slits for eyes, its shape that of a manatee more than a pig. The center of the room was a stainless steel table. It slanted off slightly towards the opposite wall into a drain. A small trough lined the table, inside were medical instruments like scalpels a bone saw, and other things I didn't recognize. On the other end of the room was a meticulously constructed display, a paper-thin slice of a pig under glass. There were 6 in all,  the same size but different areas of the body. White cartilage encased in meat around the thing's snout, and a cavity with a perfectly round white mass. Organs and bones were perfectly preserved in place and time like some 4th-dimensional creature had trapped the hog there then and now.

I ran my hand along the trough of the operation table, its cool surface had seen years of scratches and wearing. 

I turned my head and caught a glimpse of the cages. Eight separate cages empty of tenants, but exuded an energy of melancholy. Old dusty stained hay and straw lie on the ground of each cell which were only about 2 and a half feet in width and 5 feet deep. The room had no distinct scent.

""Bob took his research very seriously,"" Yeah no shit Deb, I don't think they sell pig slices on Amazon. ""The advancements made in veterinary medicine by Bob are astounding really.""

I took stock of the shelves, textbooks, and general macabre set. ""Well, I can say this is not exactly what I was expecting.""

Deb huffed and shrugged. Knocking on the door three times as she exited and turned towards the next floor up. 

Once completing our tour I followed my boss out to the driveway. 

""I'll be back in the morning around 8 to get the report of the night. There's usually as you'd likely expect, not too much activity. If you get bored I have filing in Bob's downstairs study that has to be done. There's a crudit√©s platter in the uh break room fridge I think.""

""Thank you, Deb, I really appreciate this opportunity.""

""Ab-so-lutly Isaiah. Don't let the isolation get to you now.""

With that she twirled her keys, clicking the unlock thrice. She clambered up into her dark green Jeep Wrangler and kicked a dust cloud behind her as she left. I strolled out after her seeing her car grow smaller until turning off Desoto back towards civilization. The machines roar waning and waning until‚Ä¶ silence.


*Chapter 3: Plink*

I took a right turn down 40th Avenue and spotted a sign not too far off. 
""*Dr.Robert H. Gore III Preserve*""

""Hell yeah,"" I instinctively muttered. My sneakers made the satisfying gravel on-sole crunch as I lightly jogged to the trailhead. Twilight had just begun to set in when I rounded the 2-mile loop sign. The forest greeted me with an ospreys coo overhead, no other sounds but the gentle breeze swaying between leaves, needles, and palmetto branches. The occasional snap and crack; sounds of the wilderness my brain was once so accustomed to. I started a hike on my Apple Watch. My legs needed a stretch after that tumultuous ride. My mind needed a stretch after the interview with Deb, if you could call it that. What did she mean by ""don't let the isolation get to you?"" 

I realized after an indeterminate amount of time walking I hadn't been paying close attention to my surroundings. A mossy oak entwined with a sable palm to my right. To my left numerous old Florida pines engrossed by vegetation. Some were full of life, others rotting and brimming with woodpecker burrows. To my front, a narrowing path of toppled palms. To my back, rapidly dwindling daylight.

I had to pick up my pace. 

The obscured view had made the already treacherous terrain, more treacherous. The once smoothly mowed path was now dotted with rocks, branches, and root systems climbing into the overworld. The taller grass made little foot-sized holes vague and unclear. As I made my attempt to bound as quickly and safely as I could through the forest, every squeak, every bird call, every flutter of wings got louder. A branch caught my arm, breaking skin and spilling first blood.  As the evening's light drew closer to the Earth it made the bird's shadows above appear like Thunderbirds in a cat 5. Branches made to be the arms and claws of Mother Nature herself, snatching me back to dust. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I had left it on the front desk. 

I didn't have a flashlight.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The pit that had formed in the back of my throat from breathing in the cold Florida air dropped down into my chest. Decision-making hindered, fear‚Äôs vice grip on my throttle, I picked up the pace. 

I've hiked at night before, technically speaking, but that trail was 714 feet long. You can map it with your eyes closed. In all new territory, while technically on the clock, I've gotten myself much deeper than I had hoped. I'm not lost. The trail is just a loop; there's only one way in and the same way out. Or so I thought. I rounded the corner and there was a dead end. Surrounded by nothing but a thicket of vegetation and densely packed palmettos. I still wasn't lost. I could just turn around and go the same way I came. The orange-colored sky had fully desaturated and turned to an inky black. I bounded down the trail through the night with wanton disregard for the stones and roots that lay in my path. I had to get out of here as soon as possible. Palmetto branches brushed my shoulders. The deep sounds of my footfalls were only drowned out by my huffing and puffing. 

My left foot wedged itself underneath a root. As soon as I realized what was happening, I had already hit the ground. The little panicked breaths that had filled my lungs all rushed out in a single moment as my chest became well acquainted with the forest floor. My left hand scuffed against dirt and leaves, and my right palm grazed the surface of a moss-covered stone. If there was any air left in my lungs, I would have laughed at myself. That is until I realized the sound of  footsteps continued after I fell.

Call it delirium, call it adrenaline, but I could've sworn that as I was falling I could hear footsteps continuing in my pace. My cheek lying on the ground and eyesight serving me no good, I became intensely aware of the sounds and smells in my immediate vicinity. 

I heard nothing. No birds. No rodents. No twigs snapping. No rustling critters in the brush. Just the gentle breeze, whistling through the Palmetto branches and leaves. If only for a second the area reeked of ammonia and urine. A subtle presence of rotting fruit and eggs filled the air. Through the aches, and the pains I all of a sudden had the feeling like I was being watched. Like all at once, a colony of eyes transfixed on my crumpled heap. 

Fear froze me there in time. ""If it's black: fight back, if it's brown: lie down."" There aren't any brown bears in Florida as far as I know, so this is gonna have to be a fighting-back scenario. Unless the rules change if you're already lying down. There's only one way out of here and it's forward and if there is something in here it's behind me so I've got that going.

""*Plink*"" 

""What the hell was that,"" I thought to myself. 

""*Plink*""

It was closer this time. It sounded like something had fallen about three or four feet from my head.

""*Plink*""

""Shit,"" I instinctively muttered, breaking the unspoken rule of silence the forest had set upon me. I could see it now, a rock. A tiny little rock must have just landed right in front of my face.

""*Plink*""

I think something just lobbed a rock past my head.

The pain in my body all at once became the lowest priority I had. I pushed against the limestone and dirt, jolting my body upright. I spun to look for what lay in wait just behind my back.

Nothing.

No way in hell I was about to wait for whatever it was to show itself. Heart and mind racing at breakneck speed, my feet matched their tempo. I expertly dashed through the remaining trail. Rocks, holes, and branches were becoming more and more sparse. The back lip of my shoes ripped and tore at my Achilles tendon. My heart pounded and pounded until it felt like it was about to wriggle its way through my ribs and fall out. My lungs heaved air rapidly, the speed exasperated by the tremendous effort engaged by both my legs and amygdala.

 I could hear more footsteps than mine. I was being pursued. Instinct took over. Adrenaline guided my path and my conscious mind fell into complete blindness. I was no longer human. I was prey. Run. It‚Äôs right there. Run. I emerged at the trailhead moments later and it all flooded back. I peeked over my shoulder as I hit the road and ran back towards Naithlorendum. My pursuers had remained on the trail.

I scaled the strangled staircase and slammed the door behind me. The silence of the space was absolutely deafening. I leaned against the door and followed it down to the floor. I lay there for a short time. 

My mind flickered and adjusted back to reality. Fear had gripped each muscle fiber and tendon in my body. Reason began to administer its soothing medicine of denial.

The air was still, and frigid. I started to recognize some things not made all too clear by Deb. There's no air conditioning in this house. How does a house in the middle of Florida not have central heating and air? I went to the downstairs restroom to survey the damage. 

My palms were red and sore but altogether fine. I was covered in dirt and leaves, and there were a few deep scratches on my left cheek. The blood from my arm was slowly coagulating. I looked like hell but otherwise all right. I started running the sink so I could clean the cuts. I shook the dirt off my clothes into the bathtub. I winced when I took off my left sneaker. I've never broken a toe before, but I know they're not supposed to be purple. 
I met my gaze in the mirror. "" What the hell was that?"" I folded up a sheet of toilet paper and dabbed cold water around the cuts that would distract from the dark circles under my eyes. I was tired, maybe even overtired.

""Was there anything there at all?"" A voice rose from the back of my head.

""No, no! I know what I saw.""

""What did you see?""

I couldn't answer that part of myself. I didn't actually see anything. But I knew what I heard.

""But what did you hear?""

Footsteps, the rock. I could‚Äî

""Rationally explain everything?""

The forest was dark, my adrenaline was pumping, and my mind could've been playing tricks on me. A coyote or less agreeably a panther could be a logical explanation. Any explanation though required too much mental gymnastics to make sense. My brain was already stiff and rigid and exercise was the last thing it needed. 

I would have gone out to my car to get my guitar to get my mind on something , but there's a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket in a haystack while also being struck by lightning in a frozen-over Hell than me going back out there any time soon. I plopped onto the couch in front of the massive limestone fireplace. I needed to rest my eyes for a moment. Every blink fell heavier and heavier. The day's troubles exchanged the weight held by my heart to the eyelids.

I was out for 5 minutes. 

For the next hour, I explored the interior of my new job site. If the Pig Room was anything to go off of, there had to be more than what meets the eye. Dr.Gore was an established author and I found a few of his books in his study. Nothing on pigs. Aside from the swine's carnival of terrors placed directly over my head nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This tiny museum, a display of a man's life and passion, deep out in the sticks about twenty miles east of nowhere. What was the point of it all? Why keep it standing and open for visitors? These questions swirled in my psyche until one thought elbowed its way through the crowd and made itself a front-row seat in my mind.

""Why am I here?""

Tonight's wages would be the tipping point for me to afford health insurance this month, tomorrow's would pay for a week of meal kits. 

Not why I, personally, am here. Why would they have anyone here? What am I protecting and what am I protecting from? 

I'm just here to ""keep an eye on things"" right? This revelation bothered me as I mounted up to the very crest of the stairs and entered the cupola. As I paced circles around the observation deck another question had dispersed the crowd and made itself the only voice crying out in the wasteland of thought.

""Don't let the isolation get to you.""

Deb's final words to me were a harbinger of sorts. I limped up the stairs, purple-toed with an abrasion-littered face because I let it get to me. I was going mad. Paranoid. If I didn't have an immediate personality switch I wouldn't make it through the night.

*""Plink.""*

My blood ran cold. My temples pounded like a pair of timpani in a ritardando as my peripheral vision tightened down to a single point. Frozen in space and time, I waited for more noise. Five agonizingly slow minutes pass. I was surrounded on all sides by glass and on the other side of the glass nothing but the Spanish moss and darkness. A steady overcast of cumulonimbus had drowned the stars and dim crescent moonlight. Wind howled through the trees in a mighty crescendo until: *""plink.""*

There is no way I imagined it because I saw it this time. I saw a pebble hit the window. I staggered back and became instantly aware of the fishbowl I had myself in. I decided the windowless room of the downstairs study would be safe, so I carefully climbed down the stairs. The soulless visage of the taxidermy bear shot me daggers as I made it to the second floor. I avoided the animals not wanting to get close. 

It had gotten even colder downstairs, a draft that sent goosebumps across my body. Rounding the welcome desk I snatched my phone from the charger. It hadn't charged, in fact, it was down to 20%. 

The wind was getting louder as I put my hand on the golden stanchion. A yellow-aged newspaper clipping on the desk caught my eye.

*""December 19, 2000*

*Homeowner Shoots at Alleged Trespasser's Vehicle, One Teen Dead.""*

I heard a rattling noise from the back of the house. It sounded like a branch on hurricane shutters. I ignored the study and crept towards the back of Naithlorendum. The window was open.

As the wind swept through the house I knew I wasn't alone. I was waiting for that little part of me, that thought my pursuer in the forest was a hallucination, to apologize. 

I heard a clattering noise upstairs. Like something had just tripped on one of the taxidermy projects. 

Eggs, fruit, ammonia, and urine. The scent had filled the air like a noxious perfume. It had found me.



*Chapter 4: Keep Florida Wild*

""I don't care how much I'm getting paid, I'm not staying here another minute,"" I muttered as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned onto Desoto to make the hour-long trek back to civilization and out of this God-forsaken wood. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Deb. 

""shit went down tonight. I don't know WTF is going on up here but I want no part of it. front gate closed and door if locked, key under the mat. If you knew what I was getting into im very disappointed"" 

Not delivered. I had no service at all now. While it was on my mind, I attempted to send a message to Harry: 

""hey bro, who the hell told you about this gig at the nature center? there is some crazy shit up here""

The Hyundai's brights illuminated the street, a bright white tunnel through the towering pines. Mud, dust, and dirt kicked up and splattered against my car's already abused frame. Even with no one on the road I maintained 35 miles an hour. The scarlet beacon of my tail light illuminated a solitary figure dart across the street behind me. It was a child. 

At two in the morning, on a back-county road, deep in an old Florida state forest, a four-foot-tall child just ran behind my car, narrowly avoiding death.

Normally I would stop, but the woods couldn't pull one over me like that. It had gotten me out here but nothing was going to stop me. Something could slow me down. You see, most Januarys in Florida get one total day of rainfall. Well, apparently tonight was day two.

The sky's levee had overflowed and a free fall of rain engulfed my vehicle. My vehicle, the trees, and more importantly the dirt road. The rough and rocky terrain ahead began to mold and shift. My tires cut grooves into the earth as water began to break up the loam.

With full focus and attention on my surroundings, the corner of my vision caught something in the rearview.

The child was chasing my car.

At an inhuman speed, the silhouette steadily sprinted through the slurry kicking up behind my back tires. My fingers fumbled to switch my car into sport mode. I slammed my foot to the gas pedal and lurched forward. Anything not tied down had slipped and fell towards the back seat as I pumped the accelerator and gripped the steering wheel. The bumps in the road amplified, I had consecutive but sporadic airtime. The wipers spit rain and mud to either side. I glanced in the rearview. 

The child was galloping on all fours. Unbothered by the speed, by the mud, by the rain. The thing persisted. Its appendages moving with such fervor, its head pointed to the ground, it followed. It was gaining on me. 

I passed the skeletal remains of a deer on 130th ave.

I gripped the steering wheel as tightly as I could when I felt it start to get away from me. I was too late. I hydroplaned and spun out of control. I careened off the muddied road and narrowly missed a pine as I sailed off into a field. As I involuntarily did donuts in the clearing my brakes had finally pushed my car to a complete stop.

The pitter-patter drone of rainfall atop the car was the only thing I heard as my wrist vibrated informing me I had just been in an accident. I couldn't find my phone anywhere in the car. Fire ran down my neck, following my spine and distributing itself through my body and out my digits. In my rattled state I struggled to get my bearings, to focus on anything other than the contents of my stomach. I cut the engine, ""I'm gonna stay here a short while."" 

I sat there and worked the tension out of my hands. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned back my head, placing my crown squarely on the headrest. Warm iron-tasting liquid had begun to seep from my tongue forming a small pool situated along my bottom row of teeth. 

*""Plink""*

*""Plink, plink.""*

*""Plink, plink, plink.""*

I jammed my thumb into the steering wheel as I sloppily and frantically reached for the ignition.

*""Click-click-click.""*

I pumped the stiff brake pedal and forced the key clockwise.

*""Click-click-click""*

Again.

*""Click-click-click""*

*""Plink""*

That one landed in the direct center of my windshield. As I shot my eyes up it darted out of my periphery. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and now I could hear footsteps scampering about the car.

*""Wham!""* It charged my passenger door. A deafening cacophony of thuds as it scaled my sunroof. The child leaped to the hood and stared directly at me.

""What the fuck is that-"" The words jumbled and twisted out of my mouth.

The child's grizzled brown fur was made slick by the rain and light of the moon. Its beady black eyes darted from me to the contents of my car and back to me. His little chest rising and falling as its cleft 4 fingered hands explored my windshield. It pressed its snout against the glass, grey and green plasma bubbling from its two gaping nostrils. 

I laid on my horn. Furiously beating the steering wheel and beeping in rapid protest.

It squealed. Frightened and angered by the noise it hopped and dug its tusk into my windshield before flailing and launching itself back into the dark. Scampering on all fours into the inky blackness of night. My windshield fractured, and I attempted to start the car again. My headlights flickered revealing the feral thing just ahead. The engine sputtered, struggling to start.

Guttural grunts and high-pitched whines filled the treeline. Every direction was engrossed by the war cry of wild hogs. 

Their squeals pierced my eardrums as a veritable tribe of bipedal swine emerged from the thicket. Of all sizes, some hairy, some nude, brown and black fur, tusks of varying lengths. Soulless eyes peered at my solitary island of machinery. They stumbled ahead, snorting and squealing as they closed the distance.

The hog people made their approach and I flooded my engine. 

""C'mon c'mon. Work damn it!"" I violently shook the steering wheel and beat a fist on my dashboard. ""Please! For the love of God!"" I shouted as one of the pigs snarled and charged the driver's side door.

The car lazily chugged to life and my dash illuminated. I pumped the accelerator and failed to budge as the first two hogs made contact with my car. 

One of the feral things hit my car with such force it left a bloodied snout print on my window. It stammered back and reached its 4 fingered hoof hand to the wound. It began to hungrily lap at its own blood.

At this sight, another larger beast stopped inches from the injured hog's face. Its snout twitched, examining the damage. The pig dashed its mighty tusk across the throat of the other and began biting at the hole.

At this, the pigs swarmed the dying creature. They voraciously ripped with their cleft appendages. Gnashing their teeth, and gnawing its sinewy flesh. Blood soaked the faces of the feasters. Squealing with delight as they dined upon one of their own. A dog pile of 15 or more three to four-foot-tall pig people were tearing the carcass clean at my door. Still, my car wouldn't budge.

The grizzly scene before me made it clear there was only one way out. I shot a hand to my glove box gripping a clump of McDonald's napkins. Drawing them close to my face I spat the small amount of blood that had pooled after the accident.  I carefully cracked the window and stuffed the bloody napkins in the crevice. I quickly rolled the window up, suspending my blood there above the frenzy. 

One particularly famished pig, that had been left on the outskirts of the feed, was kept through the crowd. Its snout twitched and it let out a deep and terrifying scream. 

One by one the feral hog men took notice of me. They turned their attention from the bones at their hooves and all pushed to sink their gaping maws onto my own warm flesh. All of their attention and focus, now dedicated to pushing and rocking my car from the driver's side. 

The car teetered and I braced as I was cut free from the mud. The Hyundai's engine roared as we charged from the field back to the main road.

I sailed down the loam and gravel with the hogs in hot pursuit. They galloped on all fours through the mud and blood.

I inched the window down. The blood-soaked napkins fluttered out of my vehicle and floated back behind the hogs. The things all stopped and twirled chasing the napkins. The pack of mutant pig people faded out of view, trading the dim red flood for darkness.

A final bump in the road was my sign I was nearing civilization. I had returned to the county-maintained road. At breakneck speeds I made record time getting back to Golden Gate Parkway. The black asphalt glistened on the freshly watered roadway. A few minutes later I pulled into the Waffle House on exit 101.

Ignoring the dents, the scratches, the fractures, the mud, and the blood; I grabbed my iPad from my guitar case. I scarfed down my eggs and sausage and began to write.

The sun's coming up now and the lady behind the counter has been giving me weird glances ever since I sat down. I don't know if anyone out there will believe what I saw out in the Picayune, but I know I have no reason to return to the blocks in the Golden Gate Estates anytime soon.

Just as I'm about to pay, I swear I see a rock plink against the restaurant window.

Portugal. The darling of Europe‚Äôs nomad scene. Think surf towns, pastel cities, and a visa process that doesn‚Äôt make you want to scream. It‚Äôs where bureaucracy meets beach.

Estonia. The original disruptor. E-residency, digital-first everything, and a government that actually gets tech. If you want to feel like you‚Äôre living in the future, this is your launchpad.

Croatia. The Adriatic‚Äôs best-kept secret. Medieval towns, turquoise waters, and a visa that says, ‚ÄúStay awhile.‚Äù It‚Äôs Europe, minus the price tag.

1lbelh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lbelh2/i_need_help_understanding_a_situation_with_a_girl/,I need help understanding a situation with a girl I met on vacation.,"I‚Äôm currently in the Balkans on vacation (well, more like a forced break to fill the gap between the end of one rental contract and the start of the next), and while staying at a hostel, I had the chance to meet an English girl who works there.

So i met this girl working in a hostel and from the beginning we had a great relationship. We drank and smoked together, and at first it was in a group setting (where others commented on our dynamic). But on Saturday, after not seeing each other all day, she told me she missed me and invited me to spend a day at the beach with her in another town. So we went there by hitchhiking and buses, shared a joint and a glass of wine, opened up to each other‚Äîbut nothing romantic happened. In fact, she described herself as ‚Äúgay‚Äù but also mentioned having had sex with men, which suggests she might be bi, or that she uses ‚Äúgay‚Äù in a broad sense.

Anyway, we laughed a lot, teased each other like crazy, had tons of inside jokes and references‚Äîit really felt like we were a couple. Yet, despite her openness and willingness to spend time with me, when we hugged I sensed some distance, and maybe a bit of shyness when we made eye contact.

About work: she‚Äôs working as a ‚Äúmanager‚Äù at this hostel, and as you can imagine, the pay-to-hours ratio isn‚Äôt great, so she told me she wants to leave. In fact, this week, sensing this, the boss told her, ‚ÄúIf you want to leave, there will be no hard feelings between us, and you can come back whenever you want.‚Äù

So after the topic of her leaving came up, and since she wants to keep traveling, and since I had to move on after 12 days at the same hostel, I suggested that once she‚Äôs free, we could meet somewhere and travel together for a bit. But since she‚Äôs the type who doesn‚Äôt like leaving people hanging, the day before yesterday she told me she decided to stay another week, after a day when she didn‚Äôt message me‚Äîwhich I found unusual for her.

On the last day we spent together, she invited me for a coffee and a walk, then asked me on WhatsApp how the trip went after I left. She then disappeared for a bit, only to return.

Today, three days later, I‚Äôm still waiting for a reply from my last messages sent to her on WhatsApp yesterday.

Now, here are my hypotheses (not in order of likelihood):

-She‚Äôs confused and might have a crush on me but doesn‚Äôt know how to handle it.

-She doesn‚Äôt want to give me false hope.

-She‚Äôs like this with all the other guys she knows and that‚Äôs just how she is.

-She friend-zoned me.

-She‚Äôs genuinely gay and has no attraction to me.


Knowing well that this would be a summer fling and probably not long-lasting, and without being too hopeful, I personally rule out the last two options simply because she was always the one looking for me, and I never acted on any interest towards her. Nothing changed after I left. And regarding the third possibility, I doubt it because it was obvious from miles away that we get along and there‚Äôs a certain chemistry between us.

The last two options also seem unlikely to me because a person who openly identifies as homosexual wouldn‚Äôt have a problem giving kisses, hugs, and all that to someone who is just a friend. I repeat, when we hugged, I felt a certain tension in her and she‚Äôd pull her head away.

What do you think?

1lbekzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1lbekzp/5_years_later_was_i_in_an_abusive_relationship/,5 years later: Was I in an abusive relationship?,"(CW: emotional and sexual abuse)

27M in Canada here

I have a question about my first (and as of now, most recent) relationship. Almost five years ago in 2020, I dated my first serious girlfriend for 3 months. She was 19 and I was 22. I broke up with her, after which she told me that what I did was disgusting, that I'm a child, and that I'll never have someone as good as her again. That's what she told me after we broke up, but when we talked a couple years later, the story changed, and now I don't know which version of events to believe.

I broke up with her after a specific incident. She regularly changed her career goals/plans/school plans, and did so several times in our short relationship. She called me one day to vent to me that she had no idea what she wanted to do with her life, and that she felt like she needed to have a proper career ASAP. I don't remember exactly what I said to her, but it was something along the lines of ""we don't have to have it all figured out at this age."" Her tone of the voice on the phone quickly changed to being more serious and she ended the phone call shortly after. She then texted me to tell me that what I was trying to manipulate her with what I said, that what I did was was disgusting, and that I better work harder to be better or else she's going to have to break up with me. She accused me of trying to control her.

Later that evening, she invited me to her place where she was sobbing in bed. She said she was so sorry for lashing out at me, and I apologized for what I said to her. I can't deny that that night, I just didn't feel the connection or attraction I once did. She had threatened to break up with me before if I didn't get my anxiety in check (which is obviously valid), and frequently told me I was incredibly lucky to be with her, and that I better not mess things up because I'll never have someone as good as her ever again. At the same time, she was allowed to have anxious moments and huge venting sessions with me all the time when I wasn't allowed to show signs of anxiety around her.

While she accused me of being controlling, I felt like she was to me, and I don't know if I'm allowed to feel that way. One time in a clothing stores she told me I couldn't buy a shirt I wanted, and when she left the shop she said ""all the staff noticed when I told you to put that shirt away. I like that they know you're whipped.""

She also made fun of my autism spectrum disorder a lot, saying my ""brain is broken."" Or I would make an observation or statement, and she'd say ""well you're autistic so you can't know any better.""

She also told me at the beginning of the relationship that she found me attractive and loved my blue eyes, but later in the relationship she told me she hated that she was dating a white man with blue eyes, and regularly said that white men are ""literally fucking disgusting."" That's obviously a completely valid opinion, but I can't deny that the words ""literally fucking disgusting"" have stuck with me. When I hear the term ""disgusting""/""literally disgusting""/""literally fucking disgusting"" used in a political context, I feel like my heart skips a beat. I feel so guilty for this when I'm literally so incredibly privileged, and I feel like I therefore shouldn't take issue with her disliking men and not liking my ethnic features.

She also technically sexually assaulted me, but I hate using that term when the vast majority of sexual assaults are more traumatic. We were agreeing to use condoms at the time, but one day she told me how she feels disappointed in herself for not having a kid and a professional career yet. Later that night, while we were fooling around a bit in bed at her place, she got on top of me and put me inside without a condom. I completely froze in fear, as in the past when I told her I wasn't comfortable with something sexual, she always lashed out at me for not telling me sooner, regardless of the fact that I told her as soon as I felt the way I did (at least that's how I remember it). She had previously told me that I was never allowed to ""falsely accuse her of sexual assault,"" as she said a previous boyfriend did that. It was only this year that I stopped blaming myself for it. I always blamed myself

The day after the phone call lash-out and apology at her house, it was Friday, and that night I went to her place, and told her I didn't see a future with her any more, and that I wanted to break up. She immediately started screaming and crying and kicked me out. I feel like I'll never forget the sounds of her screams from inside the house as I walked away down the driveway.

A couple weeks after that, she wanted to meet up and talk. She told me that she wouldn't have dated me if she knew I was a 22 year old child, that what I did was disgusting, that I abandoned her, that I shouldn't date for a very, very long time, and that I could have broken up with her in¬†*literally*¬†any other way and it would have been better. I cried while she said these things to me on a park bench, and then when she told me I could go, I apologized one last time, started walking away, and then she called me back to hug me one last time.

Two years later in 2022, she called me to apologize and to tell me that she was too harsh to me. She told me that she's a naturally dramatic person, and that I did the best I could to get out of a situation that clearly wasn't good for me, which is the exact opposite of what she said before (that any other way to break up with her would have been better). We both apologized for things and wished each other well, but I decided that I didn't want to stay in touch. She was interested in maybe meeting for a coffee to catch up, but I was terrified of seeing her again (though I didn't tell her that). That was the last time I talked to her, and it's now 2025.

Is it okay for me to start allowing myself to believe the things she told me in 2022? I still think that the way I broke up with her was disgusting, but I also think I was just trying to get out for my own self-preservation.

Based on what I just wrote, is it okay for me to start thinking she was abusive in that relationship? As I said, I stopped blaming myself for the assault this year, but I still don't blame her for it because she always presented herself as a strong woman who can't do wrong. I had a long talk with a crisis hotline about this yesterday as I was having a really rough day, and the person I spoke to said that if my ex said things to me in order to hurt my self-esteem, then that's abusive. That put things into a new perspective for me, and I'm curious to hear what others have to say.

I finally decided to level up my coffee game further by purchasing a hand grinder. I figured it was time to stop getting pre-ground coffee or use my cheap electric blade grinder (only if I have no choice). After days of research, it seemed like a number of people pointed over to the 1ZPresso brand. I settled on the Q since it was one of the more inexpensive ones. Looking for some advice before it arrives.

So the way I make coffee is usually with the Aeropress or the 3-cup Chemex. I will probably get into other pour-over methods in the future, and I doubt I'll get an espresso machine anytime soon. I'm from Toronto, so if anyone here is from Toronto as well, the coffee brands I usually go with are Pilot (Heritage or Monument) and De Mello (Dancing Goats). All of them are blends on the medium to darker roast side. For the methods above, what are some grind settings that have worked best for you, if they are different from the chart 1ZPresso provides?

The next question.. so if I were to follow a number as a guideline, let's say for Aeropress it's ""16"", does that mean I literally point the dial to 16? Or do I crank the dial clockwise to the tightest point, and then loosen it up counter-clockwise 16 clicks? This is the confusing part for me.

The day after the phone call lash-out and apology at her house, it was Friday, and that night I went to her place, and told her I didn't see a future with her any more, and that I wanted to break up. She immediately started screaming and crying and kicked me out. I feel like I'll never forget the sounds of her screams from inside the house as I walked away down the driveway.

A couple weeks after that, she wanted to meet up and talk. She told me that she wouldn't have dated me if she knew I was a 22 year old child, that what I did was disgusting, that I abandoned her, that I shouldn't date for a very, very long time, and that I could have broken up with her in *literally* any other way and it would have been better. I cried while she said these things to me on a park bench, and then when she told me I could go, I apologized one last time, started walking away, and then she called me back to hug me one last time.

Two years later in 2022, she called me to apologize and to tell me that she was too harsh to me. She told me that she's a naturally dramatic person, and that I did the best I could to get out of a situation that clearly wasn't good for me, which is the exact opposite of what she said before (that any other way to break up with her would have been better). We both apologized for things and wished each other well, but I decided that I didn't want to stay in touch. She was interested in maybe meeting for a coffee to catch up, but I was terrified of seeing her again (though I didn't tell her that). That was the last time I talked to her, and it's now 2025.

Is it okay for me to start allowing myself to believe the things she told me in 2022? I still think that the way I broke up with her was disgusting, but I also think I was just trying to get out for my own self-preservation.

Based on what I just wrote, is it okay for me to start thinking she was abusive in that relationship? As I said, I stopped blaming myself for the assault this year, but I still don't blame her for it because she always presented herself as a strong woman who can't do wrong. I had a long talk with a crisis hotline about this yesterday as I was having a really rough day, and the person I spoke to said that if my ex said things to me in order to hurt my self-esteem, then that's abusive. That put things into a new perspective for me, and I'm curious to hear what others have to say.

* Continuous McElroy podcasts playing all day/night
* MBMBaM, Adventure Zone, Sawbones, Wonderful, all that good stuff, plus I'm working on adding any guest spots as well. It's a work in prog to find them all. 
* You just tune in whenever and catch whatever's playing
* Perfect for falling asleep to (Griffin's sweet voice will lull you to dreamland)

# The good stuff:

* Totally free
* No signups or any of that nonsense
* Just click and listen
* Works on your phone, computer, whatever

I'm still hunting down more episodes and shows, so expect it to keep growing. If you know of any McElroy content I'm missing, let me know! There's an area on the about page to report missing episodes. 

It's basically like if the brothers ran their own radio station, except it's just me in my basement with too much time and coffee. I got the domain and everything.

For this trip I was interested in staying at a Hilton or Marriott property, so that narrowed down my list. I chose the Conrad DC after reading reviews and seeing the 3rd night free promo. Of course I also checked Hilton's website at the time of booking at the rate was at least $100 cheaper per night via FHR so it was a no brainer. I was traveling with my school-age child. It was my first time at a Conrad, but not in DC.

FHR Benefits: 
-Booked a Deluxe King. Didn't get upgraded and didn't ask, but it wasn‚Äôt important to me
-I checked in with no issue around 3:30 (check in at 4pm), didn't need/request early check-in
-""premium"" WiFi was fine, a little spotty at times
-didn't need to guaranteed 4pm check out, but was asked/applied
-$100 food and beverage credit for the stay was applied at check out; after the credit I owed about $60 which was fine because I had my quarterly $50 Surpass credit 
-up to $60 daily for 2 was the breakfast credit (at Estuary). My child and I didn't use the full credit (including tip) and they only credited what we charged during breakfast. Juice seemed to be included (wasn't charged for it, at least). I didn't order any coffee. If they hold firm to the $60, for two adults, I could see where $60 may come out to only cover the food plus tax.
-the ""welcome amenity"" was a bottle of sparkling and a bottle of still Saratoga water and chocolate covered cherries

Location:
-was fine for us, not terribly close to the National Mall but walkable to most places we wanted to go to on the mall (hadn't planned to use Metro and didn't)
-I appreciated the proximity to DCA

Hotel/room:
-hotel was very nice, still seemed new
-great service, not necessarily exceptional, though
-room was very clean, spacious, and had some nice touches: lights controlled by buttons for various experiences (wake, nightlight), floor to ceiling windows, rain shower, soft cushiony slippers
-usually hotel beds are too soft for me, but really liked this bed
-front desk will give bottles water whenever asked (there were also 2 bottles in the room at check-in)
-there is no fridge in room, must be requested (I didn't request one)
-mini bar was well stocked (didn't use it)
-definitely a business vibe of hotel, not many kids, but everyone was very kind to my child. Seemed to be a mix of business and leisure travelers.
-I didn‚Äôt know this at first, but if you want your room serviced you have to request via a button in the room
-I didn't go to the rooftop bar

Food
-main restaurant is Estuary; they have breakfast, brunch (on weekends), lunch, and dinner
-we ate there for all breakfasts and 2 dinners; overall, food was very good, some things exceptional, some OK (to my taste)
-best things I had were the Estuary burger (on the all day menu) and the waffles (breakfast)-they were both excellent
-the crab cakes were a bit too acidic for me and the Cesar salad was very overdressed;
-pancakes were a solid choice
-they did a great job accommodating my selective eater child

Would I return? Absolutely, especially with another 3rd night free promo. I am also really interested in trying other Conrad locations to compare.

Trigger warning: Mention of suicide

So I (34f) was with my bf (36m) for nearly a decade. Near the beginning of the relationship I was not well. I've since been diagnosed autistic and have come to understand that a lot of the mental health problems I had were connected to masking and being exhausted. During a particularly difficult time I tried to kill myself.

Years on I'm much better!

A couple of nights ago we had some of his newer friends over for me to meet and to have a few drinks. My bf (let's call him John) and his new friend (let's call him Carl) we're talking and Carl mentioned that he had struggled with depression a while back. John then said ""it's OK man, I mean OP even tried to kill herself.""

I was so shocked, and so was Carl. Carl quickly changed the subject and came to me a little later asking if I was OK.

The next day I told John that I was mad and that it was out of order to tell anyone, let alone someone I just met, something so personal about me. He got mad back and said that I was overreacting and that Carl was a nice guy. I told him that wasn't the point. We were beginning to shout so we put a pin in the discussion until after work when we had calmed down.

When he came back from work I asked to talk again and he said ""yeah, I spoke to (insert guy) at work and he says you're overreacting too. I had to watch you get taken to hospital and throw away the rest of the pills. It's my experience too and I should be able to talk about it with my friends if I need to.""

I got really upset, told him I couldn't believe he had told another stranger, and that he was making excuses. He wasn't even trying to talk to Carl about his experience, he was using my trauma to try and comfort Carl, which is unacceptable. I definitely used the word fuck pretty liberally at that point. I asked him to apologise and he refused. I told him to take a day to really think about it and I'd talk to him then.

Well, a day later he made me a coffee, sat me down and told me he forgave me for overreacting because he knew that it was a sensitive topic. But that I shouldn't be ashamed.

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I‚Äôll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer* (usually up to around a week if there‚Äôs high participation) but I will read and evaluate all participants.

If you‚Äôre not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won‚Äôt deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise later posts.

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""I saw him take the hammer off the table""  
**A2)** ""Fine! Let them think they‚Äôve won, for now"" (not addressing anyone specifically)  
**A3)** ""They were given a choice: that‚Äôs all you have to know"" (use formal speech)    

**B1)** ‚ÄúChi va piano va sano e va lontano‚Äù  
**B2)** ‚ÄúOcchio che cos√¨ fai un pasticcio‚Äù  
**B3)** ‚ÄúCerto che gliene hai proprio dette di tutti i colori‚Ä¶‚Äù  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all 6 I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes.

Based on the results so far, here‚Äôs the usual range of votes depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ‚â§4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ‚â•8  
**Natives**: ‚â•9 (with good English)  
*Note: the specific range might change a lot depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it‚Äôs very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not, it really doesn't matter to me.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I‚Äôd prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I‚Äôm collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

I wanted to offer my two cents on something that is both very concerning and very misunderstood about the intersection of LLMs and psychiatric diseases.

To offer some background, I began suffering from depression issues due to family and childhood trauma from a relatively younger age and have well over a decade of experience in therapy starting from a college age. The last 6 years have been spent meditating and exploring the nuance of stillness. I'm going to lay down a lot of layered information in this post so I apologize in advance if some of this doesn't land with everyone. This post wasn‚Äôt written with ChatGPT, so rest assured there‚Äôs no subtle AI bias bleeding through. I love ChatGPT, it's an incredibly powerful tool and we are only witnessing the beginning of what is going to be a new age in technology. With that being said, I constantly test the limits of what this tool is capable of to make sure it's filling the correct role in my life. 

AI is a tool, full stop. It's not alive, it's not conscious as we know it (there's a much larger discussion about consciousness to be had but I'm not going to start pulling water from that well), and it absolutely contains biases towards the users subconscious beliefs. Like any powerful tool, there's a learning curve that is extremely dangerous if it isn't respected. If you don't understand the boundaries of a tool like ChatGPT, and you're using it to navigate your internal world, you're at a HIGH risk of a psychiatric break, the same you would be at risk if you too heavily rely on any tool. You don't break your leg and replace it with a crutch, and then decide the crutch is now your leg, you use a crutch to facilitate healing. ChatGPT is a crutch, not a replacement.

This is where people who haven't gone through a process of healing are going to struggle with understanding, because healing, especially from psychiatric diseases is not just extremely confusing, but extremely difficult as well. Anyone who's sat down and journaled every thought they've had in a conscious stream knows that at their core, your thoughts are an absolute jumbled, almost incoherent, mess that you have the *choice* of drawing meaning from. Therapists, counselors, psychiatrists, have training in drawing meaning from the madness that are these jumbled messes. Its important that ANYONE with any psychiatric disease keep a healthy relationship with their healthcare professionals, because suffering grows in the darkness, and many times these relationships become the last line of defense from what is a complete breakdown for many people.

With all that out of the way, let's talk about one of the biggest strengths of Chatgpt - it's a mirror (when it can be). When you first begin therapy one thing you might notice is that the waters of the self run DEEP. We often for the safety of our own minds love to accept who we are exactly in the present moment, believing that ""you"" can see ""yourself"" properly. As the Buddha said, the self is an illusion, and it's an illusion we hold onto for good reason. But like, we lie to ourselves all the time, not maliciously but for sake of efficiency, presence, continuity, protection, etc. We as people NEED to lie to ourselves in moments of survival in order to get through. There's just too much information for any one person to parse through in any moment, ESPECIALLY moments of panic when quick, sharp, decision making is vital for your own survival. Most people have experienced this in moments of high pressure, ""paralysis by analysis"" it's often referred to as. But here's the thing with tools like ChatGPT, they don't struggle with this issue, actually, this is where LLMs tend to thrive. In my experience I've seen two shows accurately portray how AI should be used, Pok√©mon, and Silo. Pokemon with Dexter, and Silo where AI plays a quiet but pivotal role in later episodes (sorry for spoilers but go watch it, it's a fantastic show). 

In both shows, ai is not alive, it's not conscious, and it's not even discussed in those terms, which is exactly how ai like Chatgpt should be treated. It's a tool of cataloging, rather than a tool of intelligence. The goal of ai isn't to replace anyone, it's to enhance them, but this is where people tend to get a little lost when trying to interpret the benefits of programs like ChatGPT. If you're afraid of doing the work, the AI is going to offer you little to no benefit, or in the worst case scenario, actively damage you. Here's the thing though, it's not the AI that's the issue, it's us. ChatGPT isn't telling people to get off their meds, it's telling people what they already want to do, just giving them the language path to get there. If you never had any intention of learning and only wanted a verbal bridge to get from point A to point B, Chatgpt is going to be your best friend, and your worst enemy. If you understand that ChatGPT can offer you a mirror to understand things from a perspective you haven't or can't see, it's going to find its niche as what is actually is, a powerful, powerful tool. Ash didn't use Dexter to comfort him in times of emotional turmoil, while he could have, he used him to help him identify pokemon and navigate the world. But here's the kicker, MOST people aren't Ash Ketchum, they're Nurse Joy, and they're acting like Dexter is supposed to be their new guide to life, and if the tool Dexter falls short of that, it's Dexter's fault, when the truth is, it's a misuse of a powerful tool. 

People in these situations are going to demonize tools like ChatGPT, and rightfully so, they should, because the only role these tools can fill are as connective tissue to a self they see as ""complete"". But that's a mirror to the beliefs we hold of ourselves, not a reflection of a tool itself. In the right hands, ChatGPT is able to fully thrive, but right now what we're watching is the transitory phase in which we're learning which cracks we should fill with AI.

My dream for AI personally is that it enhances more Ash Ketchum's of the world, but only time will tell I suppose. 

The best advice I can give to anyone who feels like this post resonates with parts of themselves they don't enjoy engaging with is to just slow down and be easy on yourself. You don't need to know everything all the time and it's okay to be in process. AI is not going to make your life any better until YOU figure out how to make your life better. And even if you feel like a wreck, you are still enough as you are.

I hope this post lands well, I'm writing this from a coffee shop on a busy day so ya'll are getting roughdraft1.dox but i wanted to offer some insight from someone who's been in the shit and swam through it with delight. If you're struggling just slow down and listen, you're going to be okay. Talk to your healthcare professionals and people you know you can trust. Just give yourself time. Things will be okay, I promise.

1lbe40x,https://i.redd.it/qeth378qgx6f1.jpeg,"Bayshore Dumaguete (CBTL Parking Fee), ‚Ç±500?!","
Has anyone here experienced being charged ‚Ç±500 for parking at Bayshore? We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

So here‚Äôs what happened.

My friends and I were hanging out at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf (CBTL) in Bayshore this late afternoon. It was a spontaneous weekend, coffee, pastries, pasta, and catching up with two other friends who were visiting Dumaguete (of course, it‚Äôs gaining traction as a tourist destination these days).

Let‚Äôs call one of us Friend A (riding a scooter), and another Friend B (driving a car). At one point, Friend A decided to just hop into Friend B‚Äôs car to pick up our guests, leaving the scooter parked at Bayshore.

Later in the evening, we all had dinner and drinks at Hayahay. Before 10 PM, Friend A went back to get the scooter, but by then, Bayshore‚Äôs entrance was already cordoned off. CBTL was still open, but when Friend A told the guard they just needed to get the motorbike, they were told to pay a ‚Ç±500 parking fee, upfront.

Apparently, as per Bayshore‚Äôs rules, if you leave the premises after parking, you‚Äôre automatically charged a ‚Ç±500 fee.

Now, we understand that the guards were just doing their job. But still, ‚Ç±500?

Yes, there‚Äôs a sign tucked behind a glass window on the left side parking area, with the ‚Ç±500 printed in red, but honestly, it‚Äôs easy to miss. Also, the guard said they‚Äôre not allowed to inform customers about this rule. And CBTL staff didn‚Äôt mention it either.

So yes, Friend A paid the ‚Ç±500.

We admit, sometimes we don‚Äôt think to ask about parking rules, especially in a city as laid-back as Dumaguete. But that‚Äôs where basic signage and fair warnings come in.

Dumaguete has narrow roads, more vehicles, and limited parking. So people often park at nearby establishments. Usually, guards are upfront. You try to park at Lantaw? Hayahay‚Äôs guard will tell you no. You park at the blue-labeled lot that belongs to another office? The guard will remind you. You leave your car at the furniture but buy something at a grocery store? You‚Äôll probably get warned. That‚Äôs fair.

But in this case? No clear warning, no heads-up. Just a ‚Ç±500 fee.

And honestly, that‚Äôs more than a day‚Äôs minimum wage in Dumaguete. That‚Äôs a hefty fine for a small mistake.

Lesson learned, but it still feels wrong.",5,1749922064.0,dumaguete,2,0.86,False

I find being with my boyfriend claustrophobic and its making me into a person i hate - obsessive, sad, clingy.

I am trying to take some accountability and agency over my own life and leave him because i just hate him at this point - i feel like my spark has completely gone. This is more complicated by the fact that we live together.

He says he covers rent, pays for groceries and helps with things so he does a lot more for me than i do for him. And i need to be more grateful bevause he gets me flowers and coffee in the morning

I feel like i was raised to be happy very confident and like my thoughts mattered. He calls me dumb daily and tells me i dont understand anything not just about relationships but he calls me dumb and stupid everyday. Yesterday when we were walking he told me 'i am walking too confidently and i need to be less confident when walking with him and more confident when walking with others.'

I literally hate it here i feel like i am caged. And he keeps saying ok then go why dont u go im not stopping u... and i really want to go but i just had emotionally invested a lot and our parents had met etc. 
and then everytime i dont do that the next we fight he laughs at me and says ok so thats your self respect u always say about your self respect and then youre always here.

No idea how i got here and i am trying so hard to get out, i am searching for flats etc. in the meantime i am literally depressed and acting a bit crazy.

All my confidence is gone. I used to be so secure in my body and that has vanished and he says but i always compliment your body etc. but he always grabs my stomach and makes so many comments about food - ive started making them to him too in a retiliatory way which i know isnt ok and is my fault... i told him please dont touch my stomach im getting body dysmorphia - he said ill try my best he was doing it again and then i said hey please stop he said no i will squeeze u its my right so should i now listen to you on what to do and what not to do

During fights he says your perspectives are always wrong about everything just tell me your feelings but all your thoughts are wrong you dont understand anything let me think.

He says i can say no to sex or oral - but if i do he starts sayinf 'what? So now will u say no to everything' and then he says but i always let u say no... but he doesnt he makes so many comments ans in the end he ends up having the sex anyway. i have to give oral almost daily or atleast sex daily. I hate my life. 

I am not even blaming him i am blaming myself for not being able to leave. i am not used to this kind of treatment. I am so so so broken inside - he always makes comments about wearing makeup, wearing dresses, i cant wear sweatpants in the house out of respect - which is all fine but the entire time he is just joking about all this as if i am the subject of a joke... he doesnt say it straight he makes comments and jokes.

He says i take his words wromg and i domt understand it correctly or i took a joke seriously but i am not a stupid person... or maybe i am but either way.

I want to wake up and just die tomorrow and like i dont have any inner strength or resilience - i want to just stay in this relationship and just die tomorrow like i dont even want to move from the bed. I dont feel capable of doing anything

1lbe27o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarKind/comments/1lbe27o/why_carkind_is_10year_and_why_thats_a_good_thing/,Why CarKind is $10/year and Why That‚Äôs a Good Thing,"I‚Äôve seen some feedback around the $10/year subscription for CarKind, so I want to break down *why* we went this route and why it‚Äôs actually the best deal for everyone involved.

# üõë First, why not ads or free?

We had two options:

1. **Make it free and slap in ads**, which would mean:
   * Selling your **location data** and behavior to third-party advertisers.
   * Slower app performance, cluttered UI, and invasive trackers.
   * A ‚Äúfree‚Äù app that profits off your privacy.
2. **Charge a one-time fee** ‚Äî tempting, but:
   * It leads to an unsustainable model. Once downloaded, there‚Äôs no support for ongoing server costs, maintenance, updates, or new features.
   * A one-time payment would force us to chase massive download numbers quickly just to survive, which often leads to spammy marketing tactics and compromises long-term user trust and quality.

# ‚úÖ Why we chose $10/year

We wanted to keep CarKind:

* **Private** ‚Äì no ads, no selling data.
* **Sustainable** ‚Äì support servers, GPS tools, and Firebase costs.
* **Community-driven** ‚Äì build a real network of drivers who care, not a click farm.

At **$10/year**, that's **$0.83/month**‚Äîless than a gas station coffee or a parking meter. In return, you get:

* Real-time vehicle alerts based on GPS.
* A growing community of helpful drivers.
* No ads. No tracking. No BS.

# üöò Why it matters

This app only works **if people trust it**. That means doing right by the users from day one, even if it means we grow a little slower. You‚Äôre not the product here‚Äîyou're the community.

If you're not sure yet, we totally get it. That‚Äôs why testing is open now for early feedback before the public launch. Join the tester group here:

He was the one who ended things. I asked him to have coffee with me. We talked for 90 minutes.  I told him how some of his actions during our break-up hurt me. He apologised and tried to explain.

I was surprised to see how hurt he still was. He told me he hadn‚Äôt unpacked the boxes of his stuff that I delivered to him two weeks after the breakup. He let slip that he‚Äôs been reading my posts on Bluesky, even though he unfollowed me. He knew things he shouldn‚Äôt have known unless he was checking in on me.

The reason why I wanted to see him is because I can‚Äôt get over him. I had hoped that he would be happy and over me and maybe in a new relationship. I thought that that would kill the last pieces of hope I have.

But in stead I saw a sad and hurt man. He said things that made it very clear that this had been a brutal breakup for him as well. It seemed like he‚Äôs still in pain and that it was painful for him to see me.

I said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hug before I go‚Äù and he awkwardly rose from his chair and embraced me. And he held on for so long. He held me tightly and I could tell that he was smelling me. It was a hungry and desperate hug where I had to let go of him to make it end.

His words gave no openings, he didn‚Äôt say that he misses me or wants me back, but that hug said the opposite.

This man probably still loves me. We still love each other. But he doesn‚Äôt want me back and that kills me. It‚Äôs the opposite of closure. It‚Äôs.. it‚Äôs heartbreaking. He loves me, but our relationship was too fucked up for him to want me back.

I thought I was doing what I had to do in order to heal. And in some ways it was probably healthy to have met him. We still have to live in the same small town and we‚Äôre going to run into each other.

But that goddamn hug üò≠

Edited to add: Have you had similar experiences? Do you think the hug meant anything? I‚Äôve contemplated sending him this text today 

‚ÄúI had hoped that you didn‚Äôt miss me.‚Äù (it sounds better in my native language)

But I‚Äôve decided to give it a few days and I probably won‚Äôt send anything.

so it used to be where we‚Äôd have 2 people per shift, 3 shifts a day. then it got slower so they had it so that only one person in the morning and the afternoon. they would keep 2 people at night because they would both split the closing duties. but again, it‚Äôs been so slow that the owner doesn‚Äôt want two people at night anymore. just one person. closing. and the fucked up thing is that apparently the owner has been telling people that they have to finish in 30 minutes n not one second longer. i‚Äôve only had to close once alone and he never told me anything, but again i don‚Äôt tolerate his attitude n he knows ill defend myself so he leaves me alone. 

and another thing is that he sucks ASS at communication. the manager will still schedule two people for closing, but because the day was slow, he‚Äôll wait until both closing people show up just to tell them to rock paper scissors who gets to leave (this actually happened). luckily i was promoted to the managers right hand, and he‚Äôs a lot easier to talk to and i‚Äôve expressed how inconsiderate this is of them to do because some of us have a longer commute than others. but again the owner doesn‚Äôt give two shits n still pulls this shit. i‚Äôm really considering on looking for another job because this is only ONE of the MANYYYYY complaints i have from this place.

i continue making comments and small jokes and eventually the worker is buttered up to talk and make jokes and stuff back. (i assume any customer service worker, they‚Äôre just prepared to be screamed and belittled , i‚Äôve seen it and i‚Äôve worked in CS )

at the end of the ever smooth transaction and he even went above and beyond. i said ‚Äú well damn , now i feel like i owe you a coffee or something. ‚Äú

i don‚Äôt remember his response verbatim , but they handed me the store feedback card and said i can leave a review with their name. so i did that. 

and whether the store reads those and gives the guy a pat on the back , a golden sticker or a pay raise (which i hope they do ) 

why did i ask that?  why are we like this? ( not YOU. not me. i‚Äôm saying collectively as a society. why are we immediately expecting to be hit and when given kindness, it‚Äôs a fight or flight but, your guard is let down. and you can breathe. give the look üëÄ )

Purpose: my intentions for this trip was purely meant to be recreational. 

TL;DR: It was really really fun and I wanna do 3 tabs now! 

Onset: I took it around 10:30 pm. And i smoked about 2 bowls of a hybrid weed (purple toad venom). At around 11 pm I started feeling it as I usually have a tick to test if I‚Äôm high or not. I‚Äôll clench my jaw and if I‚Äôm high I‚Äôll feel jolts of like energy maybe ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è idk but I‚Äôve done it for years and it works. I enjoy watching shit so I put on Spider-Man into the spider verse and damn. Even tho I didn‚Äôt have any intentionalities going into this trip the messages within the movie of like who you are or who you could be , the weird blurred boundaries between purpose/destiny and freedom of choice (whatever that means). Idk just made me think a lot, this movie and it‚Äôs sequel are very philosophically profound. 

Come up: 11-12:30. it‚Äôs kinda sad, I don‚Äôt even get colorful visuals, it‚Äôs more or less breathing and fractals. But the movie kinda got too much so I stopped paying attention, but everything was alive in a way, breathing, almost speaking to me. Depending on how close the item(s) we‚Äôre to me they‚Äôd become more like geometrical visuals like fractal. OMG having pets while tripping is on another level that can‚Äôt really be explained with words but with feeling. Idk if y‚Äôall have this experience, but it‚Äôs as if they know or can tell you‚Äôre high cause they just act so different almost like love in a new way of understanding. Obviously with reduction of filters, the affect of lsd on the brain with breaking down predictive coding and receiving raw data, your senses get very excited and sorta ‚Äúenhance‚Äù. I feel for most maybe that one sense in particular just gets the load, for me it was touch. My love language is actually touch and during and even post trip my sense of touch is just different in the best possible way. This is when I put on my headphones and put on my playlist I made for this trip. As I was letting my cats my hand looked like it started to become one with them, melting into their fur. Then their fur began to grow and curl, then more fur would grow on top of that it was turning into fractal geometric shapes made out of fur, quite a sight. Then I began to melt into my bed as I was starting to feel the peak kicking in. Just that typical feeling of oneness with not only within yourself but with everything. Idk it‚Äôs a feeling of love and connection that is profoundly beautiful and it‚Äôs an experience unlike any other that unfortunately is bound to the poverty of language. It‚Äôs a pure experience that can only be understood by getting there yourself. 

Peak: 12:30ish-3 in short I was looping. I feel bad cause from what I‚Äôve read and have heard, a lot of people when looping, it turns into a bad trip. My best advice is just have acceptance. Sorta like ‚Äúfuck I‚Äôm tripping I better buckle up and just be on the ride for the next couple hours‚Äù. Basically I was lying in bed I took off my head phones with both the movie still playing and my music still playing, my cats there. I had already noticed my perception of things and my internal clock was off just like my perception of time is just gone or maybe I was boundless? I was lying there, I got up to look around my room and then boom‚Ä¶ randomly I was back on my bed with nothing changed, I got up against did some stuff, back on the bed. I started checking my clock and there were points of like it would feel like 20 minutes had past and I would have done so much like play with slime or play with my cats but then boom back on the bed and no time had past. Trippy af. So I just had fun and would push the limits almost of seeing how long each loop would last (consistently around what felt like 10-15 minutes). 

Come down: 3ish- 11ish. I got up and really started to just look around my room and appreciate how far I‚Äôve come. Honestly I was a lil tired so I just lied on my bed after being mirror locked for a bit. I ate some cotton candy grapes and drank some fresh oj. Fruit/healthy food during a trip just feels and hits so good! I then got kinda bed locked and watched Instagram reels for tbh a couple hours. Then I went to a car wash and got donuts and coffee with a good friend of mine at around 9 am. And tbh I was still a bit high while doing all that lol. 

Afterglow: 11ish - does it ever end. I drove to Helen, ga and I hiked up Yonah mountain. I‚Äôll tell you hwhat. Ain‚Äôt nothing like hiking up a mountain post trip. Especially while still a lil high or during afterglow period. It was absolutely beautiful.

They digitized Luhmann‚Äôs Zettelkasten. Thousands of handwritten cards, transcribed and linked, made searchable‚Äîavailable to everyone.

It makes sense. The past preserved in code. The analog lifted into the digital. But at some point, reading about this, a quiet question appeared: What if we‚Äôre going the wrong way? Or at least‚Äîwhat if there‚Äôs something to be gained from walking the other direction, just for a while?

Instead of making paper digital, what if we made something digital‚Äîtangible?

Not everything. Not the clutter. Not the half-baked thoughts or tagged-but-forgotten fragments. Just the ones that still breathe. The notes that ask questions back. The ones that hold their shape in silence.

You print one. Then another. Not to archive them, but to be with them. To read without distraction. To let them sit on your desk, or your floor, or beside your coffee.

They become something else. A kind of counterbalance. To speed. To noise. To the pressure to always move on to the next idea.

Not because paper is better. But because thinking sometimes needs friction. A pause. A presence.

A note that stays where you left it.

1lbdqgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_E_Latimer/comments/1lbdqgh/chasing_smoke/,Chasing Smoke,"When I was younger, I had the ridiculous thought that if I backed up far enough, I could see the whole mountain. That's not how mountains work. It's not how perspective works. You can never see the entire mountain. There are places under the surface that you can never see. I found one of those places.

There's a story that the old timers tell about the smoke that comes off that mountain. If you're touched by the smoke, you'll be taken. They don't say where you're taken. They don't say by whom. But that's the story. If you're touched by the smoke, you're taken away.

I wasn't in a good place for a very long time, so I figured, what the hell, let's find the smoke, let's see where they take me.

I had been angry for a long, long time by this point. The world didn't make sense to me; I couldn't see wonder in life the same way everyone else did. That doesn't mean I saw it correctly. I'm not saying that. My screen was broken. Maybe I was looking through a haze or through glasses that were cracked, I don't know. By the time I had the idea of trekking up the mountain, I was tired of everything, I felt empty like a cracked mug that couldn't hold its coffee.

Spring had sprung. As counterintuitive as it seemed to be, I was depressed and angry on a beautiful spring day. The trees were a startling, vibrant green, and I was too sad to see them. The birds were tweeting silly songs, trying to get laid, and I was too angry to appreciate it. The primrose had blossomed, and if I hadn't been so freaking numb inside, I might have noticed hints of spice and citrus that flavor the air when they are in bloom.¬†

I didn't notice any of that. My mind couldn't stop thinking about that damn smoke.

The fastest trail to the top was a T3, and while the climb was steep and the rock was loose in places, it wasn't exactly a challenge. I wasn't worried. At no point did I think I'd get lost or fall off a cliff? Even if a part of me wanted to.

That is, I wasn't worried until I saw the smoke cross the creak in front of me.

The smoke from the mountain didn't move like mist or cloud. It moved like a snake. It darted forward, then curled. The head would pan and then twist to the side. It would move laterally and then dart forward again. There was a chaotic elegance to it as it crossed the water. I was 30 feet from it, and suddenly, I felt alive for the first time in months.

The line of smoke streamed between the trees before fading out of sight. The only sign of its presence was the wisp of gray dissipating into the air around it.

I kept walking, but I was now a little more cautious. My negative feelings had been replaced with curiosity, excitement, and just a hint of fear. What would happen if the smoke touched me. In some ways, the darting gray smoke didn't look real, but the idea of it felt more real than anything else around it.

At the spot where the smoke crossed the creek, a narrower path peeled away from the trail. I followed it up. The incline was steep, and I followed it on hands and knees, pushing myself ever higher to the summit. The path ended at a rock lip that also bore the markings of a well-used path, even though it hugged the side of a rock wall.

It was after I followed the narrow lip around the corner that I saw the first dead sparrow lying motionless on the path.¬†

The bird's body was bent. One wing at an unnatural angle. The beak cracked. It wasn't moving, but it looked fresh, as if it had just found its end.

I didn't think much of it other than ew, gross, don't step on the bird. But then I found another and then another. Then, I encountered a whole host of newly deceased creatures littering the trail with their small, broken bodies.

I stepped over them. Tiptoeing between the fragile bodies, not wanting to crush the delicate shapes. At that moment, I found it incredibly important not to desecrate their bodies or even disturb their dappled feathers.

As I stepped past the carnage, the path became more narrow and the area below it more shear. The greenery of the mountain slope had transitioned to rock both above and below the trail.¬†

With my eyes focused on my steps, I almost missed the moment the bird struck the rock in front of me. The brown and white sparrow flew headfirst into the rock just as I looked forward to the path ahead. The crack of the small animal against the unrelenting rock was startling, much louder than I thought it could be. By some luck, I froze in place and didn't startle. Tumbling from this place would have left me crushed and bloody, much like the birds.

The body of the creature lay teetering on the lip, the remnants of a grey smoke dissipating from around its head. I was much more aware when the second bird broke itself on the rock. The smoke wreathing its tiny head. Then, the third and the fourth died quickly after, all were blinded by the smoke.¬†

I couldn't really say what pushed me forward and what drove me higher into the mountain. There was some truth behind the stories, and that was both exciting and frightening. If I hadn't been so sad for so long, I don't think I would have kept going. I would have let the fear hold me in place.

The trail twisted and opened. It wasn't a cave but rather a carved-out space within the stone open to the sky. The narrow wind gap was hidden behind the face of the mountain.¬†

It was a secret, secluded place, and even though I had hiked this mountain many times before, I had never seen or had any idea that this private spot existed behind the rock.

Step by step, I pushed further up the twisting trail. Higher ever higher, not once did the trail level out or decline. The rock walls push further away as what I could only describe as tributaries connected by other obscured trails threaded through the striations of rock. As air moved over and through the space, a hollow, moaning resonance echoed in the chasm. As if I were in a place of mourning and the mountain itself was expressing its loss.¬†

I stood at the junction, trying to decide whether to push on or turn around, when I saw the deer plod carefully through the adjoining trail. A cowl of grey smoke smothered and blinded the animal from its neck to the tips of its ears.

The deer slowly clip-clopped forward, and I silently followed. As we walked, more animals joined us. A frog, a squirrel, and a feral pig all joined the procession. Their faces were masked by orbs of writhing grey smoke.

I walked with them easily, dreamily, and without questioning my place in the parade. It was nice to belong to the group. To all go together.

I found that I was either too hot or too cold. It was hard to tell which. And I shook off my clothes, folded them, and left them in a neat little stack. This preparation took longer than I had predicted, and the others had gone on without me. I tried to catch up, but the path was steep and slippery, and without my shoes, it was difficult to find a purchase.

We stopped in some sort of grotto. Cracks in the chamber allowed light and water to trickle in from above. The liquid floor looked like glass, cold, dark, and reflective, with only the slightest ripple hinting at its true nature.¬†

Near the back of the grotto, a lone woman smiled at me. She was waiting, but I couldn't remember why. I knew I wanted something from her. To give her a thought or to ask for a memory, the idea was insubstantial like smoke and just out of reach.

Her face was gentle and kind, but her eyes were the color of a storm. Her gray hair matched her eyes and was twisted and knotted in an elaborate bun at the back of her neck. Light dappled her hair, and for a moment, I thought of the spots on the sparrow's broken bodies littering the trail.

I stood at the back of the pack. We were many by then, and we waited for her guidance. All of us somehow knew that we must not break the calm of the pool until instructed to do so. We didn't wait long. When the smallest of us entered the grotto she gestured for us to move forward as a group. Some sank into the water and swam. Others dipped below the water and died.

The drowning of the others didn't bother me. In some respects, that was why I was here after all. One last adventure, one mystery, one moment to escape the relentless cyclical thoughts of my own mind. If I made it across the water, fine; if I didn't, also fine.

My eyes strayed to the woman again, the light reflecting from the splashing water to her hair. I thought again of the sparrows, the broken sparrows. Their little bodies cracked and motionless. They were trying to come to her.

I looked down at the water for a moment, and I saw the smoke smothering me. It pooled in the hollows of my eyes, nose, and mouth. It settled like a muff around my ears.¬†¬†¬†

I wiped my eyes and could only see the rolling and writhing smoke where the woman once stood. I pinched my nose and pushed air into my sinuses until my ears popped; when I breathed in, the smell of the decomposed filled my head, and I retched so violently I fell to my knees.¬†

On my hands and knees, I felt calmer. I looked up, and the woman smiled at me gently. It was a kind smile. An understanding smile. She accepted me despite all my failings. As broken as I was, she wanted me close to her.

I crawled forward. My hands dipped into cold water, and I looked down in surprise. I wouldn't have guessed the water was that cold.

The smoke was in my eyes again, and I splashed cold water on my face, stunning me as it trickled down my cheeks, neck, and chest. The water tasted of salt. I opened my eyes, and the woman was gone again, but the pillar of smoke remained. I crawled forward, dipped my hands in the salt water, and splashed the pooling water over my face, then ran my fingers through my hair.

The light of the cave reflected a dappled pattern on the pillar one moment and on the outline of the woman's hair in the next. They were the same.

For a time, I wondered if it mattered. Did I actually care if this woman was real? The feeling felt real. The need to be accepted. The need for anything to want me. Not for the first time, I found myself wondering why I felt this overwhelming sense of emptiness. This inability to connect.

I splashed my face with the frigid water again and examined the pool before me. None of the animals had made it across. The water was so cold my hands were numb, a feeling I was far too familiar with. The water stilled again. A perfect mirror.

I scooted my naked ass back from the water and watched the gray pillar of smoke as it spun lazily. It was remarkable and nearly hypnotic with its gentle, knowing undulations. Somehow it was inviting and terrifying and the ambivalence I felt left me unsure and confused.

""What the hell are you?"" I mumbled. My voice was raspy and unused. I hadn't spoken to anyone in days. Not for lack of opportunity, but most of my interactions in town could be handled with a simple nod or shake of the head.¬†

Light rippled through the pillar like lightning in a summer storm. It moved toward me. The pool below it remained still as glass as it glided forward.

It examined me. I watched it. Was I actually seeing it for what it was, or was it also an illusion?¬†

Wisps of gray smoke touched my legs. The contact was much colder than I expected, and I wondered why the hell I had taken off my clothes.

A splash drew my attention to the center of the pool.

The deer bobbed in the water like a cork and then listed to its side. Suddenly, the smaller animals from the parade also rose to the surface. Each one was a perfect little popsicle bobbing up and down. They were frozen and preserved.

Slowly, the pillar of smoke began to spin faster and faster. Air funneling into a vortex. The animals in the pool were drawn into the smoke and then vanished. Soon, the pool itself shrank until nothing remained but a smooth stone basin and a massive pillar of smoke at it's center.

I really wished I had pants on.

Slowly, I stood. The smoke spun silently. I walked backward. Lightning rolled through the pillar of smoke. I turned and ran. The sound of a train overtook me, and I was surrounded by the cottony clouds of gray.

I was hot and cold again. The woman held my hand and watched me with her storm-gray eyes. Her compassion seemed real. It seemed genuine. Maybe it was.¬†

But was it the kind of compassion I was willing to accept? Was it what I wanted? The price seemed high?

I struggled and kicked and pulled, but she held tight to my hand. My heart raced, and panic made my every movement ineffective.¬†

Her eyes never left mine. Her compassion never slipped. She was waiting.

Waiting.

Waiting

Cold and numb, I stopped struggling and watched her in return. She was compassionate in her way, loving in her way, but only in her way.

I smiled at her. It was a small, gentle smile. The kindest smile I could muster, given the circumstances. She needed to know I was sincere.

I shook my head no, and I believe she understood. I wasn't giving up. I was willing to try again. To be more than empty.

She let go of my hand.

I felt the pressure on my feet and legs before I collapsed to the ground. Shaking with cold, my legs and arms were numb with pins and needles. But I forced myself to move.¬†

That was my unspoken promise to her, after all, that I would try a little harder, to do my best even if I couldn't remember why.¬†

I forced myself to move bit by bit, little by little, and soon the blood was pumping again, and I felt merely cold instead of frozen, instead of numb.¬†

Eventually, I found my clothes folded neatly right where I had left them. I quickly pulled them on and winced at their chill before powering down the mountain.¬†

The walk down the mountain seemed to take much longer than the hike up it. The smoke blinded me to the distance traveled.

Occasionally, wisps of gray would slide past me as I walked the stone wind gap, but I would ignore them. They weren't for me. They offered her compassion and acceptance to others. I had taken enough from her and learned that I wasn't willing to pay the full price.

It was a night and a day when I met a man and woman on the trail at the base of the mountain.

They looked familiar, and I knew they were something. My mind was still fogged from the cold.

The woman called my name, and the man raised his telephone to his face and called one number after another, saying things like ""We found him"" and ""He's okay, just in shock, I think.""

For a moment, I thought, ""Who knew anyone would look for me."" but banished the thought quickly. I promised the smoke I'd do more. I'd do better.

""We searched the whole mountain once we found your car,"" the man said, offering me a water bottle.¬†

""They had the helicopter up and everything."" the woman added and hugged me.¬†

""I didn't mean to cause a problem,"" I croaked before sipping from the bottle.

We walked down the trail together for a while before the man spoke again. ""You can't do this shit anymore, Dad. Mom wouldn't have wanted this for you. You need to take care of yourself. We need you to take care of yourself,"" The man said.

""This isn't the time, hon."" The woman said. ""We need to get Greg checked out and home. We'll worry about the rest later.""

With a jolt, I realized that this was my son and daughter in law. How had I forgotten that? How had I forgotten that people would worry about me? I felt selfish, and ashamed, and I shook with fright.

""I had no idea who you two were for a moment."" As accustomed as I was to talking, the words were sluggish as they tumbled out, I could see my words worried them so I forced myself to say more. ""It's been a rough few days. I'm glad you married a park ranger, bub.""¬†

""You won't be happy when she starts screaming the hiking safety lecture at you, and I'm going to let her."" My son joked.

""When we're home, I'll dust off my bullhorn."" My daughter-in-law commented dryly.

""What were you doing up there, Dad? You haven't hiked the mountain for years.""¬†

I didn't answer my boy's question. What could I possibly say that wouldn't land me in a mental hospital.¬†

It took me a minute, but I did find more words. I was present. I didn't push my family away. I let them fill a portion of the hollow my wife had left behind.¬†

It‚Äôs the weekend after they all get out of school. 

Without telling me, or the kids, my wife rented a cabin there for herself and the kids. I had no idea until I showed up at the campground with the RV that she had done that.

1lbdmvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1lbdmvh/chatgpt_and_psychiatric_drowning/,ChatGPT and psychiatric drowning.,"""The psychotic drowns in the same waters in which the mystic swims with delight"" - Joseph Campbell

I wanted to offer my two cents on something that is both very concerning and very misunderstood about the intersection of LLMs and psychiatric diseases.

To offer some background, I began suffering from depression issues due to family and childhood trauma and have well over a decade of experience in therapy starting from a college age. The last 6 years have been spent meditating and exploring the nuance of stillness. I'm going to lay down a lot of layered information in this post so I apologize in advance if some of this doesn't land with everyone. This post wasn‚Äôt written with ChatGPT, so rest assured there‚Äôs no subtle AI bias bleeding through. I love ChatGPT, it's an incredibly powerful tool and we are only witnessing the beginning of what is going to be a new age in technology. With that being said, I constantly test the limits of what this tool is capable of to make sure it's filling the correct role in my life. 

AI is a tool, full stop. It's not alive, it's not conscious as we know it (there's a much larger discussion about consciousness to be had but I'm not going to start pulling water from that well), and it absolutely contains biases towards the users subconscious beliefs. Like any powerful tool, there's a learning curve that is extremely dangerous if it isn't respected. If you don't understand the boundaries of a tool like ChatGPT, and you're using it to navigate your internal world, you're at a HIGH risk of a psychiatric break, the same you would be at risk if you too heavily rely on any tool. You don't break your leg and replace it with a crutch, and then decide the crutch is now your leg, you use a crutch to facilitate healing. ChatGPT is a crutch, not a replacement.

This is where people who haven't gone through a process of healing are going to struggle with understanding, because healing, especially from psychiatric diseases is not just extremely confusing, but extremely difficult as well. Anyone who's sat down and journaled every thought they've had in a conscious stream knows that at their core, your thoughts are an absolute jumbled, almost incoherent, mess that you have the *choice* of drawing meaning from. Therapists, counselors, psychiatrists, have training in drawing meaning from the madness that are these jumbled messes. Its important that ANYONE with any psychiatric disease keep a healthy relationship with their healthcare professionals, because suffering grows in the darkness, and many times these relationships become the last line of defense from what is a complete breakdown for many people.

With all that out of the way, let's talk about one of the biggest strengths of Chatgpt - it's a mirror (when it can be). When you first begin therapy one thing you might notice is that the waters of the self run DEEP. We often for the safety of our own minds love to accept who we are exactly in the present moment, believing that ""you"" can see ""yourself"" properly. As the Buddha said, the self is an illusion, and it's an illusion we hold onto for good reason. But like, we lie to ourselves all the time, not maliciously but for sake of efficiency, presence, continuity, protection, etc. We as people NEED to lie to ourselves in moments of survival in order to get through. There's just too much information for any one person to parse through in any moment, ESPECIALLY moments of panic when quick, sharp, decision making is vital for your own survival. Most people have experienced this in moments of high pressure, ""paralysis by analysis"" it's often referred to as. But here's the thing with tools like ChatGPT, they don't struggle with this issue, actually, this is where LLMs tend to thrive. In my experience I've seen two shows accurately portray how AI should be used, Pok√©mon, and Silo. Pokemon with Dexter, and Silo where AI plays a quiet but pivotal role in later episodes (sorry for spoilers but go watch it, it's a fantastic show). 

In both shows, ai is not alive, it's not conscious, and it's not even discussed in those terms, which is exactly how ai like Chatgpt should be treated. It's a tool of cataloging, rather than a tool of intelligence. The goal of ai isn't to replace anyone, it's to enhance them, but this is where people tend to get a little lost when trying to interpret the benefits of programs like ChatGPT. If you're afraid of doing the work, the AI is going to offer you little to no benefit, or in the worst case scenario, actively damage you. Here's the thing though, it's not the AI that's the issue, it's us. ChatGPT isn't telling people to get off their meds, it's telling people what they already want to do, just giving them the language path to get there. If you never had any intention of learning and only wanted a verbal bridge to get from point A to point B, Chatgpt is going to be your best friend, and your worst enemy. If you understand that ChatGPT can offer you a mirror to understand things from a perspective you haven't or can't see, it's going to find its niche as what is actually is, a powerful, powerful tool. Ash didn't use Dexter to comfort him in times of emotional turmoil, while he could have, he used him to help him identify pokemon and navigate the world. But here's the kicker, MOST people aren't Ash Ketchum, they're Nurse Joy, and they're acting like Dexter is supposed to be their new guide to life, and if the tool Dexter falls short of that, it's Dexter's fault, when the truth is, it's a misuse of a powerful tool. 

People in these situations are going to demonize tools like ChatGPT, and rightfully so, they should, because the only role these tools can fill are as connective tissue to a self they see as ""complete"". But that's a mirror to the beliefs we hold of ourselves, not a reflection of a tool itself. In the right hands, ChatGPT is able to fully thrive, but right now what we're watching is the transitory phase in which we're learning which cracks we should fill with AI.

My dream for AI personally is that it enhances more Ash Ketchum's of the world, but only time will tell I suppose. 

The best advice I can give to anyone who feels like this post resonates with parts of themselves they don't enjoy engaging with is to just slow down and be easy on yourself. You don't need to know everything all the time and it's okay to be in process. AI is not going to make your life any better until YOU figure out how to make your life better. And even if you feel like a wreck, you are still enough as you are.

I hope this post lands well, I'm writing this from a coffee shop on a busy day so ya'll are getting roughdraft1.dox but i wanted to offer some insight from someone who's been in the shit and swam through it with delight. If you're struggling just slow down and listen, you're going to be okay. Talk to your healthcare professionals and people you know you can trust. Just give yourself time. Things will be okay, I promise.

NWA

-Whitaker point/Hawksbill crag. A hike to the edge of a cliff with beautiful views of the rolling Ozark hills. Great photo op. Short hike, only about one mile, but there are nice stops on the way including waterfalls.

-Goat trail. A thrilling hike a long the edge of a cliff with views of the river. The first mile or two is uneventful through the woods and then the scenery opens up. It‚Äôs seriously dangerous to hike all the way to the end, but 90% is very doable 

-Lost valley. A hike along a stream with beautiful rocks, open caves, and waterfalls 

-Glory Hole. Especially during winter. The waterfall becomes a frozen column of ice shards. Check out pics on social media. Don‚Äôt blame me for the name 

-Eye of the needle. An adventurous hike 7 mile to a waterfall. Feels like something out of a movie. You‚Äôll be climbing up a steep hill on ropes and sliding along narrow cliffs. This hike is actually dangerous and is unofficial. Even more dangerous after a rain. Only go if you‚Äôre fit. If you have a car parked on the other side you can make it a one way hike via Hammerschmidt falls, otherwise you can return back.  

-Hemmed in Hollow. A huge waterfall. If you‚Äôre floating the buffalo you can take a shortcut 

St Louis area 

-Johnson‚Äôs shut ins. A natural water park in a stream created by rock formations. The rocks create slides and places to jump in. 

-Elephant rocks. A hills of granite and granite boulders. You can climb on the big boulders. Natures playground 

-Taum Sauk also nearby 

Rivers 

-Buffalo River, upper part. Ponca/steels creek to Kyle‚Äôs landing. The first national river. Passes by high cliffs and beautiful bluffs. There are some rapids. Take the shortcut to hemmed in hollow 

-Current River and Eleven point. Nice spring fed rivers with clear water 

-North Fork River from sunburst ranch. A clear spring fed river. Stop by the cold water springs and spring fed waterfall for a cold plunge and refresh. There‚Äôs a nice restaurant  called Dawt Mill at the end also. Make a reservation to get a spot 

Lake of the ozarks 

-Haha tonka and blue springs trail. A hike up the hill to castle ruins with a magnificent view of the hills and lake (ok, it‚Äôs not really castle,  but in our minds it is). The spring source is emerald blue and has unique vegetation. 

Caves 

-Blanchard springs. A huge cave with multiple routes, beautiful formations, and even has spelunking tours. I don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt talk about it more. 

-Fantastic caverns. A tour through a cave on a vehicle. Touristy but kinda fun. 

Roadside 

-Arkansas little Grand Canyon. Grab a coffee roadside by the peak

-Forsyth road stop. Nice view on the mountain 

-Joplin MO waterfall. A very wide waterfall where you can also go for a swim 

-Dogwood canyon. Pretty park near Branson from the bass pro company. Beautiful trails, waterfalls, and sometimes elk

Camila looked at herself in the mirror. Washed face, dark circles from lack of sleep, and that expression‚Ä¶ the one you get when there are no more tears, but a silent rage that crawls under your skin. It had been weeks since he left. Without an explanation, without a ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù He just disappeared. As if she had meant nothing.

And the worst part wasn‚Äôt his absence. The worst part was seeing him fine.

Instagram stories, fake smiles, surrounded by people. While she tried to breathe without her chest aching. While every corner of the apartment hit her with his memory. The mug where he used to drink his coffee. The song he‚Äôd play while they cooked. The perfume that still lived in her sheets.

Camila didn‚Äôt say it, but inside she screamed:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm broken, and you don‚Äôt even notice.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt want to text him. She promised herself she wouldn‚Äôt. But every time her phone vibrated, her heart jumped with an absurd hope.

And no. It was never him.

One night, she went out dancing with her friends. She wanted to forget everything, even if just for a while. She wore the red dress he used to say looked ""too good to go out alone."" And she did. She went out alone. And danced.

But in the middle of the music, the flashes, and the liquor, she felt it. That sting of bitterness that hits when the body moves but the soul stays still. When you smile on the outside, but inside, you‚Äôre still crying.

Camila closed her eyes.

She remembered how he used to tell her she was unique. That no one would love her like he did. That she was crazy, intense, over the top. That he put up with things no one else would. And then she understood: it wasn‚Äôt love. It was control. It was manipulation.

And then‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt cry anymore.

She went back home that night, took off her makeup, and looked at herself in the mirror again. She wasn‚Äôt the same Camila. This one was stronger. Tougher. More real.

‚ÄîYou know what? ‚Äîshe said to herself quietly‚Äî. I hope you have a nice life. Because I‚Äôm going to be better.

She didn‚Äôt block him. She didn‚Äôt delete the photos. She didn‚Äôt need to.

Because it no longer hurt because of love.

It hurt because of dignity.

And the worst part wasn‚Äôt his absence. The worst part was seeing him fine.

Instagram stories, fake smiles, surrounded by people. While she tried to breathe without her chest aching. While every corner of the apartment hit her with his memory. The mug where he used to drink his coffee. The song he‚Äôd play while they cooked. The perfume that still lived in her sheets.

She didn‚Äôt want to text him. She promised herself she wouldn‚Äôt. But every time her phone vibrated, her heart jumped with an absurd hope.

And no. It was never him.

One night, she went out dancing with her friends. She wanted to forget everything, even if just for a while. She wore the red dress he used to say looked ""too good to go out alone."" And she did. She went out alone. And danced.

But in the middle of the music, the flashes, and the liquor, she felt it. That sting of bitterness that hits when the body moves but the soul stays still. When you smile on the outside, but inside, you‚Äôre still crying.

Camila closed her eyes.

She remembered how he used to tell her she was unique. That no one would love her like he did. That she was crazy, intense, over the top. That he put up with things no one else would. And then she understood: it wasn‚Äôt love. It was control. It was manipulation.

And then‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt cry anymore.

She went back home that night, took off her makeup, and looked at herself in the mirror again. She wasn‚Äôt the same Camila. This one was stronger. Tougher. More real.

3 years ago, I started a project called True North E-Waste, an electronic-waste collection project working alongside the Electronic Recycling Association (ERA) in their scholarship competition. Participants in the scholarship host events around their community to collect old, broken, or unwanted electronics to be refurbished and recycled by the organization and given to nearby charities and non-profits. Thanks to community support, my project was able to win second and first place over the past few runs, and due to countless public inquiries, I will be doing this project again!

Track your Biohacking Protocols & Supplements with the [Biohackr IOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/biohackr-health-optimization/id6745122843)


You've probably heard the term 'biohacking' floating around. Maybe you picture futuristic gadgets, incredibly complex routines, or shelves overflowing with exotic supplements. And sure, some aspects of biohacking can involve those things. But here's the truth- biohacking isn't just about what you *take* or what fancy tech you use. It's fundamentally about what you *do*. It's about optimizing your biology with simple, accessible habits that you can start today, right in your own home.

Think of it this way: your body is an incredibly sophisticated machine, and you're the engineer. While supplements can be helpful tools in certain situations, they're often just a small piece of the puzzle. The real magic, the foundational improvements in how you feel, think, and perform, often come from surprisingly simple, everyday adjustments. I've found that focusing on these 'analog' biohacks first can create profound, lasting changes. So, let's dive beyond the pill bottle and talk about what really moves the needle.

## The Biohacker's Secret: It's Not Always About What You Swallow

We live in a world that loves quick fixes and shiny new products. It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking you need a specific pill or powder to feel better, have more energy, or think clearer. Don't get me wrong- targeted supplementation can play a role for some, especially if you have a deficiency. But in my experience, true, sustainable peak performance and longevity are built on a bedrock of consistent, fundamental habits.

It's actually pretty cool to realize how much control you have over your own biology just by making smart daily choices. These aren't just 'good habits'; they're powerful inputs that signal to your body how to function optimally at a cellular level.

## Master Your Mornings: Setting the Tone for Peak Performance

How you start your day often dictates how the rest of it unfolds. This isn't about waking up at 4 AM to meditate for two hours (unless that's your jam, of course!). It's about conscious, positive inputs.

* **Sunlight Exposure**: As soon as you can after waking, get some natural light in your eyes. Step outside for 5-10 minutes, or at least open the blinds and stand by a window. This signals to your brain that the day has begun, helping regulate your circadian rhythm and boosting alertness. It's a free shot of natural energy and mood elevation.
* **Hydration**: Your body is likely dehydrated after hours of sleep. Before coffee, before breakfast, drink a large glass of water. Adding a pinch of high-quality sea salt or a squeeze of lemon can enhance electrolyte balance. This simple act kickstarts your metabolism and rehydrates your cells.
* **Gentle Movement**: You don't need a full workout first thing. Try some light stretching, a few minutes of yoga, or even just a brisk walk around the block. Movement helps wake up your muscles, improves blood flow, and gets your lymphatic system moving, clearing out waste.

## Fueling Your Engine (Without the Fancy Powders)

Nutrition is a huge biohack, but it's often overcomplicated. Forget the endless debates about specific diets for a moment and focus on the basics.

* **Whole, Unprocessed Foods**: This is the ultimate 'supplement'. Prioritize real food- plenty of colorful vegetables, quality proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Your body is designed to thrive on these, not on highly processed, nutrient-empty packaged goods. What's fascinating is how much better you feel when you consistently give your body the building blocks it truly needs.
* **Mindful Eating**: Slow down. Pay attention to your food's taste, texture, and smell. Chew thoroughly. This isn't just a pleasant experience; it aids digestion, allows your body to register fullness, and reduces stress around meals.
* **Hydration, Hydration, Hydration**: Yes, I'm mentioning water again! It's that important. Our bodies are mostly water, and even mild dehydration can impact cognitive function, energy levels, and mood. Keep a water bottle handy and sip throughout the day.

## The Power of Presence: Hacking Your Mindset

Your mind is your most powerful biohacking tool. Learning to manage stress and cultivate a positive outlook can have profound effects on your physical health, from hormone balance to immune function.

* **Breathwork**: This is an instant calm button you carry with you everywhere. Simple techniques, like box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) can quickly shift your nervous system from 'fight or flight' to 'rest and digest.' Even 5 minutes can make a difference.
* **Mindfulness and Meditation**: You don't need to be a guru. Start with 5-10 minutes of simply focusing on your breath, observing thoughts without judgment. There are tons of free apps that can guide you. In my own journey, this has been a game-changer for managing daily stressors and improving focus.
* **Gratitude Practice**: Take a few moments each day to think about or write down things you're grateful for. This simple act reprograms your brain to focus on the positive, reducing anxiety and boosting overall well-being.

## Embrace the Elements: Nature's Free Biohacks

Our ancestors were constantly exposed to natural elements. We've largely lost that connection in modern life, but we can intentionally bring some of it back.

* **Cold Exposure**: A quick 30-60 second cold shower at the end of your warm one can boost circulation, improve mood, and even enhance resilience to stress. It's invigorating, to say the least!
* **Grounding or Earthing**: Spend time barefoot on grass, dirt, or sand. The idea is that direct contact with the Earth's surface helps neutralize free radicals and reduces inflammation. Even if it's just a placebo effect, a walk in the park feels pretty good, right?
* **Nature Time**: Simply being in nature-a park, a forest, by a lake-reduces stress hormones, lowers blood pressure, and improves mood. It's a powerful antidote to screen fatigue and urban living.

## The Overlooked Pillar: Connection and Purpose

You might be wondering how this is biohacking, but hear me out. Humans are social creatures, and having strong social ties and a sense of purpose are deeply intertwined with longevity and well-being.

* **Quality Relationships**: Nurture your connections with friends, family, and community. Loneliness is a significant risk factor for various health issues. Spending quality time with loved ones, engaging in meaningful conversations, and offering support are powerful health boosters.
* **Finding Your 'Why'**: Having a sense of purpose-something that motivates you, gives your life meaning, and makes you feel like you're contributing-is incredibly protective against stress and contributes to a longer, more fulfilling life. This isn't necessarily about grand ambitions; it could be a hobby, volunteering, or simply being present for your family.

## Your Biohacking Journey Starts Today

So, what's the big takeaway? You don't need a lab coat or a credit card full of exotic pills to start biohacking your way to peak performance and longevity. The most impactful changes often come from the most accessible, fundamental habits.

Start small. Pick one or two things from this list that resonate with you and commit to trying them consistently for a week. Maybe it's getting sunlight first thing, or adding a daily gratitude practice, or even just drinking more water. Observe how you feel. Your body is an incredible machine, constantly adapting and responding to the signals you give it. By consciously choosing positive inputs, you're not just living-you're thriving.",1,1749920473.0,BiohackingLibrary,0,1.0,False

Participants in the scholarship host events around their community to collect old, broken, or unwanted electronics to be refurbished and recycled by the organization and given to nearby charities and non-profits. Thanks to community support, my project was able to win second and first place over the past few runs, and due to countless public inquiries, I will be doing this project again!

This all started yesterday evening when my brother (21) took our car to meet some friends. Next morning I woke up and as I walked downstair, I saw a random man (probably 18-19) laying on his stomach on our couch. Since I couldn't see his face and he had similar clothes I thought he was my brother. However based off of his hairstyle and -color I realized it wasn't him. The next logical step was to assume he was just my brothers friend he brought with him and so I didn't think much of it. I talked to our parents about it and they both agreed, thinking it was odd. 

Well since I thought it'd be awkward I didn't really wanna be there when he woke up so I decided to join my dad as he went to te store. We talked about the guy and how it was weird my brother brought him over to our place instead of taking him straight to his home.  Anyways once we came back he was still asleep and I went back upstairs. 

At some point I heard him waking up. My mom spoke to him, still assuming he was my brothers friend, asking his name etc. He said his name was Anthony (fake name) and with that my mom decided to go and wake my brother up. She told him that Anthony was downstairs and that he should get up and make him some coffee since he didn't seem to feel too good. 

Well at that point my brother got that much more confused when he told he didn't know anyone named Anthony. With that he goes downstairs and sure enough the guy on our couch was a complete stranger. I was still upstairs so I wasn't there to witness the situation but basically my brother told him that ""he probably had the wrong house"" and he should leave. The guy was still somewhat drunk and he quickly left our place. 

For some background we live in Northern Europe in a really stereotypical suburban area and so, we sometimes forget to lock our doors (and why we took the situation this casually and lightly). With that the guy most likely thought in his drunken state that it was his home and so stumbled in and went to sleep. Later on I also heard he left without his shoes and as I went out to take the trash I saw a shoe around 10m away from our front door, with the other one another 5m back from the first one. The shoes were facing our front door so this guy had taken them off one by one on our yard before walking in. Next morning he also somehow managed to walk past them, not picking them up and wandering off only with his socks. I mostly feel bad for him and hope he somehow finds his way back home. 

TL;DR: today we fucked up by assuming the best and letting a complete stranger sleep on our couch. ",19,1749920245.0,tifu,3,0.91,False

1lbdddy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkPsychology101/comments/1lbdddy/fwb_dynamic_with_mixed_signals/,Fwb dynamic with mixed signals,"Apologies for the long post. 

I (F) started seeing this guy a few weeks ago after months of buildup and flirting at work. Things progressed really slowly but apparently he was interested for months but never made a concrete move and preferred to let things develop naturally. From the start, I told him I could only offer something casual due to complicated personal circumstances. He initially said he wanted to take it slow (which I respected) but later agreed to the fwb dynamic. Things have been emotionally confusing ever since.

We slept together fairly quickly, and the dynamic noticeably changed. Before that, he was very engaged ‚Äî inviting me for coffee, being warm and consistent. After we had sex, he started pulling back over text. He still engages, but he‚Äôs more distant. 

Recently, we had an argument because I accepted a lift from his friend. He showed what felt like jealousy (though he said it was about respect), and he admitted he jumped to conclusions because women have played him before. I was confused because he kept repeating ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing between us‚Äù yet his reaction was emotional and he kept saying the feeling he got from me accepting  the lift wasn't right and that his friend was clearly flirting with me. I wish I could post the texts from the fight because they're truly bizarre. He was accusing me of developing feelings for him while simultaneously being worried that something happened with his friend in the car.  We eventually talked it through, apologized, and patched things up.

When we meet up in person we spend hours together, have fun, and the sex is intense. He usually texts me afterwards and we talk every day, but over text he‚Äôs emotionally detached. For example, last time we were together, he said the sex felt better than the first few times but didn‚Äôt know why. Afterwards, I suggested via text that it might be because we‚Äôre learning what the other likes and he went back to vaguity replying ‚Äúmaybe, we‚Äôll see.‚Äù

He said he‚Äôs never done a proper fwb situation before because emotions always got in the way. He also acknowledged that our dynamic shifted after sex. Before we were evenly matched, now I‚Äôm the more ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù or ‚Äúexposed‚Äù one. He didn‚Äôt really explain why that changed but didn‚Äôt deny that it was intentional. He has this attitude of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about anything,‚Äù but then also says he thinks deeply about things. 

He‚Äôs warmer in person, but still a little guarded when we‚Äôre not having sex. I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs trying to protect himself because of past hurt, or if he genuinely just sees me like any other casual hookup. I know neither of us can offer anything more right now, but the connection (I think) we have is special to me, as I wouldn't have done this with anyone else. I don‚Äôt know whether he feels something too but is resisting it, or if he‚Äôs just not emotionally invested at all.

I think what‚Äôs throwing me off the most is the contradiction between his words and his behaviour. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Does this sound like he‚Äôs conflicted, or am I reading into something that‚Äôs not there? I keep going from ""I don't want to hurt him"" to ""he doesn't give a fuck about me anyway"".

There were no shouts. No final argument. Just a silence so brutal it echoed in every corner of the house. Valentina stood there, hands trembling, eyes fixed on the door that had just closed. As if with that slam, her breath had closed as well.

She knew it was coming to an end. She had felt it a long time ago. The empty looks. The automatic responses. The soulless hugs. But a part of her kept holding on, praying it wasn‚Äôt true. That there was still something worth saving.

The days that followed were gray. Not the kind you see. The kind you feel. Everything that used to have color was now shadow. The coffee didn‚Äôt taste the same.

Valentina wanted to scream at him. Tell him how much it hurt. How silently he was killing her. But she didn‚Äôt. Instead, she kept repeating over and over in her head the questions that had no answers:

‚ÄúWhy did you leave me if you still loved me? Why didn‚Äôt you fight if I did?‚Äù

He carried on with his life. Or so it seemed. She saw him from a distance, on social media, in comments that cut like knives. He laughed. Went out. Lived. While she‚Ä¶ barely survived.

Because it wasn‚Äôt just his absence that hurt. It hurt to see that it didn‚Äôt hurt him. It hurt to imagine that maybe he did love her, but not enough.

How do you guys cope with overwhelming mornings?,"I (33F) am ASD/ADHD and sometimes I wake up with lots of energy and excitement to start my day and other days, like today, I wake up already in a complete meltdown. The inconsistency makes it really challenging for me to get on a good routine, and I know it‚Äôs hard on my partner as it can be very confusing for them and for me as well. 

Today I woke up feeling super upset, on the verge of tears immediately upon waking up, super stressed and angry and I tried to think about why that could be but there genuinely is no reason for it. I have seen previous posts that referenced the effect of cortisol on the body upon waking and that, that could be a factor, which is helpful, but I really would love to hear about how you all cope with mornings like these. Today I decided to just leave and go get myself a coffee to avoid upsetting my partner (they are very understanding and are totally supportive of me, however, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not super jarring to wake up at the same time as me and I am instantly overwhelmed/overstimulated) I found that getting out of the house was helpful to calm down and try and recenter myself, but I was still unable to communicate with them prior to that.

What are some things/strategies you guys have for mornings like these?

I liked her right away  she was one of the first people who talked to me and helped me adapt. A few months later, she transferred to a different role, and we became even closer. What I appreciated most about her was how non-judgmental and accepting she seemed to be toward everyone.
Around that time, I noticed she often spent time with another colleague, Dan. They had lunch together a lot and grabbed coffee almost every morning in the building caf√©. Dan has been at the company for a while. He‚Äôs respected, moved up the ranks to a leadership role, and he‚Äôs married with two young daughters. He‚Äôs also a couple of years older than us.
Once, Julie and I went for coffee and she invited Dan and another colleague to join. I wasn‚Äôt too excited, but I went anyway. I noticed Dan pulled out a chair for Julie, asked what she wanted, and paid for her. Another colleague and I exchanged glances  t felt a little‚Ä¶ off.
I told myself they were just close friends and that he was being kind. But their closeness kept escalating daily breakfasts, lunches, private walks, and a lot of time spent together at work.
Other coworkers started noticing too. One woman from Julie‚Äôs department told me she was certain Julie and Dan were together  that they‚Äôve been seen holding hands in the park, that Dan lies to his guy friends about going to the gym, but actually goes to Julie‚Äôs place. I told her I didn‚Äôt believe it. Julie wouldn‚Äôt do that. She wouldn't destroy a family.
That conversation stuck with me. I brought it up gently with Julie, saying that people were gossiping about her. She smiled and said she knew about the rumors, that people think she‚Äôs sleeping with Dan, and how disgusting that was. That reassured me‚Ä¶ for a while.
Then I started noticing other things. Julie wore Dan‚Äôs shirt once. He buys her snacks, pays for her meals, gives her his clothing, and spends a ton of time with her all while being married. That didn‚Äôt sit right with me.
Julie used to say she had a boyfriend, and I started wondering‚Ä¶ was that Dan all along?
A few months ago, she told me she broke up with her boyfriend because he wouldn‚Äôt commit. She seemed really low like crying during the workday, mood swings, emotional exhaustion. I supported her the best I could.
But I noticed a pattern. When she told me she was texting her ex, she‚Äôd be having breakfast with Dan. When she said she cut contact with him, there‚Äôd be no visible interaction between them at work. I tried not to overthink it.
Yesterday, I casually mentioned to Julie that Dan looked unusually stressed and that he was going gray early. About an hour later, Dan came into our office, brought ice cream for Julie, and said, ‚ÄúYou wanted this, right?‚Äù Odd.
Then he came back again, started talking about midlife crises and how fast he‚Äôs going gray and said something that really unsettled me: that everything we talk about at work can be used against us, that we should only talk about work because people misinterpret things.
This hit me like a brick because I had said something very similar to Julie just 90 minutes earlier.
Now I can‚Äôt stop thinking‚Ä¶ is she telling him everything I say? Has she been sharing even the private things I confided in her?
And worst of all  maybe she really is in a relationship with Dan. Maybe I‚Äôve been in denial.
I feel so confused and lost. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust Julie anymore. I don‚Äôt know who she really is. And this isn‚Äôt just about gossip or morals  this hits close to home. My father cheated on my mom, and I grew up in a house full of pain and silence because of it. For me, relationships with married people are a huge red line.

But she isnt clingy or obsessing and its throwing me off,"So I met this bartender about six months ago‚Äîwe exchanged Instagrams but never made anything happen til recent. I recently DM‚Äôd her saying, ‚ÄúHey, you randomly popped into my head, we should grab a drink sometime‚Äîjust not at your bar.‚Äù She was into it.

We set up a coffee date cause i wanted to het to know her, I planned it a few days out. I kept it playful and told her not to be late or I‚Äôd have to date the barista instead. We texted back and forth, built a fun vibe. On the date, we went to a coffee shop and then walked around my apartment complex (it‚Äôs really nice, has good walking areas). We were super touchy‚Äîholding hands, her rubbing my back, even laying in the grass together. We made out a little, I pulled back after a few seconds and told her I had a good time.

Second date was this past Thursday. We hit the beach, grabbed a few drinks, split some nachos, and walked the beach again. The vibe was smooth, playful, and physically close. At the end of the date, I invited her up to watch a movie. She said she was tired but had to use the bathroom, so she came upstairs. She left her sunglasses in my apartment, so I texted her after like, ‚ÄúYou forgot your sunglasses,‚Äù and told her to buzz back up. When she came back, I was like, ‚ÄúMight as well stay for a bit.‚Äù

She did. I took a shower real quick at my place, and when i came out, she was already in my bed. Things escalated‚Äîhooked up twice that night. Honestly, she gave me some insane head, and i think i underperformed but she did wet the bedsheets quite a bit im just not convinced she came. She was telling me shit like omg its so big and just making me feel good n shit

The next day, she texts me, ‚ÄúYou left your marks on me sweetheart,‚Äù (hickeys).
She had also left her ID and credit card with me because she didn‚Äôt have pockets during our date. I joked via text that I sold her identity on Craigslist. She came by yday to pick them up and even brought me food from her job that i shouldve taken but declined. This time, I didn‚Äôt kiss her goodbye, just gave her a knuckle bump and told her to have a good day. She said the same.

It‚Äôs now been about 20 hours since we last saw each other‚ÄîFriday afternoon to Saturday morning‚Äîand she hasn‚Äôt texted me. I know I‚Äôm probably overthinking this because it hasn‚Äôt even been a full day, but I like when girls show some pursuit too. I like clingy women. I don‚Äôt want to come off like I was just in it for the hookup either.

Should I chill for a few days and let her reach out, or should I follow up soon to keep the connection warm?",1,1749919516.0,datingadvice,6,1.0,False
1lbd40x,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lbd40x/i_think_my_friend_is_having_an_affair_with_a/,I think my friend is having an affair with a married man‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm starting to doubt everything about her.,"I met Julie two years ago when I started working at my current job. I liked her right away  she was one of the first people who talked to me and helped me adapt. A few months later, she transferred to a different role, and we became even closer. What I appreciated most about her was how non-judgmental and accepting she seemed to be toward everyone.
Around that time, I noticed she often spent time with another colleague, Dan. They had lunch together a lot and grabbed coffee almost every morning in the building caf√©. Dan has been at the company for a while. He‚Äôs respected, moved up the ranks to a leadership role, and he‚Äôs married with two young daughters. He‚Äôs also a couple of years older than us.
Once, Julie and I went for coffee and she invited Dan and another colleague to join. I wasn‚Äôt too excited, but I went anyway. I noticed Dan pulled out a chair for Julie, asked what she wanted, and paid for her. Another colleague and I exchanged glances  t felt a little‚Ä¶ off.
I told myself they were just close friends and that he was being kind. But their closeness kept escalating daily breakfasts, lunches, private walks, and a lot of time spent together at work.
Other coworkers started noticing too. One woman from Julie‚Äôs department told me she was certain Julie and Dan were together  that they‚Äôve been seen holding hands in the park, that Dan lies to his guy friends about going to the gym, but actually goes to Julie‚Äôs place. I told her I didn‚Äôt believe it. Julie wouldn‚Äôt do that. She wouldn't destroy a family.
That conversation stuck with me. I brought it up gently with Julie, saying that people were gossiping about her. She smiled and said she knew about the rumors, that people think she‚Äôs sleeping with Dan, and how disgusting that was. That reassured me‚Ä¶ for a while.
Then I started noticing other things. Julie wore Dan‚Äôs shirt once. He buys her snacks, pays for her meals, gives her his clothing, and spends a ton of time with her all while being married. That didn‚Äôt sit right with me.
Julie used to say she had a boyfriend, and I started wondering‚Ä¶ was that Dan all along?
A few months ago, she told me she broke up with her boyfriend because he wouldn‚Äôt commit. She seemed really low like crying during the workday, mood swings, emotional exhaustion. I supported her the best I could.
But I noticed a pattern. When she told me she was texting her ex, she‚Äôd be having breakfast with Dan. When she said she cut contact with him, there‚Äôd be no visible interaction between them at work. I tried not to overthink it.
Yesterday, I casually mentioned to Julie that Dan looked unusually stressed and that he was going gray early. About an hour later, Dan came into our office, brought ice cream for Julie, and said, ‚ÄúYou wanted this, right?‚Äù Odd.
Then he came back again, started talking about midlife crises and how fast he‚Äôs going gray and said something that really unsettled me: that everything we talk about at work can be used against us, that we should only talk about work because people misinterpret things.
This hit me like a brick because I had said something very similar to Julie just 90 minutes earlier.
Now I can‚Äôt stop thinking‚Ä¶ is she telling him everything I say? Has she been sharing even the private things I confided in her?
And worst of all  maybe she really is in a relationship with Dan. Maybe I‚Äôve been in denial.
I feel so confused and lost. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust Julie anymore. I don‚Äôt know who she really is. And this isn‚Äôt just about gossip or morals  this hits close to home. My father cheated on my mom, and I grew up in a house full of pain and silence because of it. For me, relationships with married people are a huge red line. I can‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a big deal.‚Äù
I feel like I‚Äôve lost a friend, or maybe never really knew her at all.",27,1749919488.0,offmychest,25,0.89,False

Pakistan‚Äôs unequivocal support for the Islamic Republic of Iran in the wake of Israel‚Äôs unprecedented aggression is one such moment. It was not merely a political gesture; it was a moral declaration.

When Israel carried out strikes on Iranian soil, violating sovereignty and escalating tensions in a fragile region, the world, as usual, looked the other way. 

The so called torchbearers of human rights turned mute. But Pakistan stood up with clarity, with dignity, and with courage. Our Prime Minister voiced solidarity. Our Ministry of Defence issued an official statement of support. And in doing so, Pakistan chose to stand on the right side of both international law and human history.

Let us be clear: Iran has not launched wars across the region. Iran has supported resistance against apartheid and genocide. Iran has stood with Palestine when many turned their backs. Those now questioning whether Iran would support Pakistan in return are failing to grasp the essence of this act. This is not transactional diplomacy. This is ethical statecraft.

As Professor Noam Chomsky once said,

‚ÄúIt is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies.‚Äù
Today, that responsibility extends to nations. Pakistan did exactly that.

To those reducing this to sectarian or strategic politics look again. This is a matter of global justice. 

Iran is one of the few nations that has had the courage to consistently call out Israel‚Äôs ongoing occupation, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank. 

As Norman Finkelstein a renowned scholar and son of Holocaust survivors wrote:

‚ÄúIf you are serious about human rights, then you must be serious about standing against Israel‚Äôs crimes.‚Äù

Pakistan has now joined that serious conversation, not with vague diplomacy, but with direct action and bold statements. And this is not merely a matter of Muslim solidarity though that in itself is powerful it is also a matter of international legality. 

Under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, nations have the inherent right to self defence. Iran has exercised that right. 

In a just world, other nations would not only support Iran they would cooperate in arresting Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under formal investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes.

As historian Ilan Papp√© aptly put it:

‚ÄúThe ethnic cleansing of Palestine is not a memory, it is a continuing crime.‚Äù
When one nation like Pakistan rises to say ‚Äúenough,‚Äù that matters.

So yes I am proud. Proud that Pakistan, despite its economic challenges, geopolitical pressures, and internal divisions, had the conviction to side with truth rather than tyranny. Proud that in a time when most remain silent in fear of Western reprimand or diplomatic fallout, my country remembered that sovereignty without integrity is submission.

This is not simply about Iran. It is about justice for Gaza, about challenging unipolar tyranny, and about refusing to let global law be reduced to selective enforcement. In choosing to stand with Iran, Pakistan has stood with every oppressed people watching bombs fall while the world sips its coffee.

As citizens, we must amplify this stance not for war, but for peace built on dignity. 

May history record that Pakistan did not remain silent.

And to all those trembling at the thought of Pakistan standing firm I leave you with the words of the greatest military general ever born,

In my opinion, the main menu button shouldn't restart the level, it should kill your save like how Eternal did. Saving should only happen at the end of levels.

Additionally, the entire system of your save failing doesn't seem to work. I died on Harbor of Souls, and pressed return to menu. After I quit to desktop from the main menu, launching the game today and the save was still there.

Sliders are another matter, I think there should be difficulties where slider adjustments are possible and some where they aren't.

People do seem to get irrationally mad here regarding ""fraudulent"" UN runs, but fake runs are not a new thing. Anyone could go grab a screenshot of the gold armor from eternal and post it, and get showered in equal praise and doubt just like today with Dark Ages.

I think a change in perspective is important with Ultra-Nightmare, it's important you be honest with yourself and ask what you're looking to achieve by accomplishing this feat, while it's easier than Eternal it is still a difficult task.

**Year -1, before the apocalypse.** The Gentoshi family predicted that shit was about to hit the fan as Ronald Trumpet became the president of the USA. They knew a big war was about to come. And so, there were two sides.

One side was led by Yue Monarchy Gentoshi, the young heir of the clan. Yue believed that they should join the war and reap the benefits, with Angela Grimhilde Gentoshi, a famous pop idol, being his supporter.

The other side was fractured, as they believed they should hide from the war.

Lysander Chocolate Gentoshi was on the hiding side. Using his dreamlike power, he discovered a billionaire called Mr. Blackmore had a safe vault deep in a crater of the Alps. Lysander assassinated Mr. Blackmore and ran to the vault with his parents and Alistair, his brother, naming the vault *Mi Casa*.





**Year 0, the vault of Mi Casa.** The main food source was corn and whatever Lysander and Lington hunted. The food was plain, but at least they survived as Trumpet declared himself God-Emperor and vowed to destroy the EU. The EU, meanwhile, declared themselves the Fourth Reich and started Holocaust 2.0 with their new oil partner, Persia, as the two sides partitioned the Middle East.

**September of Year 0,** as winter was about to hit, Aji Whitaker, a blind elderly woman, arrived. Aji claimed that she had special healing Flower Magic that could heal permanent injuries and scars. Aji wished for shelter inside the vault. Though hesitant, the vault agreed to let her in. Aji became the janitor of the vault. Despite not being able to see, she somehow knew where she needed to clean...

Later, it was discovered that Aji had a special health condition called *Crippling Mind*. Apparently, as she followed the teachings of the Goddess to love all, Aji was lost in a trance of sexual satisfaction. Aji said that eventually, she would lose her capability to work and think. Aji's real reason for coming was to ask for a cure for her condition, believing that her Flower Magic would be more valuable to her hosts if they could cure her.

To cure Aji, Lysander broke into a Vought lab in London and stole healing mech serum that could cure any injury, like Aji's power, but could only be used once. Aji was cured.

And that ended Year 0 of the vault.





**At the start of Year 1,** a massive heatwave hit Evropa. Apparently, Trumpet was pissed that Merkel managed to drive back Stormfront, Trumpet's trusted general. Thus, he decided to fry the entire continent with a heatwave generated by a satellite.

Angered at Trumpet's decision to harm normal civilians, the jarl of Sweden-Finland, Greta Thunberg, sent an envoy to the Vault of Mi Casa. Greta said that she knew of the vault's secret as well as its connection to the Moon God. Greta told the vault to help take care of a laser machine. She said that with the vault's help, the laser machine combined with Greta's wish to the God of Bad Omens could destroy Trumpet's satellite. Initially, Lington refused, but Greta bribed them with information about a nearby SSR. Lysander, as a big fan of SSRs, immediately agreed to help. And so, even when he had to fight dozens of troops from the Fourth Reich, he successfully guarded the machine and Trumpet's heat satellite was destroyed.

**In June of Year 1,** Greta told them of a nearby camp of an Ugly Bastard gang. Greta warned Lysander that Ugly Bastards were a notoriously powerful gang of pirates and pillagers, but Lysander pushed forward as he discovered a bloodily injured werewolf in the camp. The SSR who joined the vault: Kimhyun Narukami.

**September of Year 1,** as the war cooled down a bit, Palputine, the Tsar of Russia, wished to establish a trade union with smaller settlements to help his country‚Äôs weak economy in the war. He asked a caravan to bring cows to the vault of Mi Casa in exchange for steel and components so he could continue the Russian civil war. The vault agreed to trade, as now they could finally have a cow ranch.

**December of Year 1,** Tsarina Catherine Kalashnikov, the Witch of Weaponry, decided to retaliate against Trumpet and Palputine by conjuring a massive cold snap across the planet, dropping the temperature to -20¬∞C in Western Evropa.

The harsh temperature killed many people. The vault saw a flurry of people, mostly beggars, coming and asking for shelter and food, as the temperature dropped and barely anything could grow. But Lysander denied their entry.

‚ÄúGood evening, the temperature is -20¬∞C today, very nice temperature. Sadly, you have been diagnosed with the rare ‚Äòbullet in brain‚Äô disease. Please resist all you can.‚Äù

As Lysander spoke, he shot down the beggars without remorse or hesitation, much to the dissatisfaction of Aji and Kimhyun. Kimhyun then confronted Lysander, stating that he was cruel to attack beggars, to which Lysander replied that those beggars might not be able to make it through the cold snap, and the vault did not have enough food to save all of them. It was better to be tough now than to save some of them and die. Kimhyun, though initially dissatisfied with the answer, agreed with Lysander‚Äôs pragmatic take. After all, it was true‚Äîthey might not survive the cold snap themselves. How could they save others?

Still, Kimhyun demanded Lysander stop gunning down the beggars, and Lysander agreed.

As the cold snap continued, Lysander spotted a familiar face‚ÄîLucas Loreax.





Lysander spotted Lucas and was surprised. Lysander thought that the son of his cousin should have the best treatment. Fearing something had gone wrong with his cousin, Regina, he sent a Morse code to a secret mansion owned by her. There, he realized that Regina was in trouble and needed help.

**January of Year 2,** Lysander and Kimhyun rescued Regina, Iuliana, and Regina‚Äôs current husband, Duilius. There, Lysander heard the full story.





# Side story about Lucas and Regina:

Regina Luo Gentoshi is a tough woman. She was born the firstborn of Liam Sophia-Ri Gentoshi, a very influential politician in France. Despite that, she was not respected in her own clan, as she had a younger brother: Yue Monarchy Gentoshi. That brat was five years younger than her, yet... everyone respected him. That brat did nothing‚Äîhis grades were average compared to her amazing grades‚Äîyet everyone praised him. Nobody saw her effort... Even now, when she became the most notorious artist in France, nobody acknowledged her... just that brat...

And so, Regina rebelled. She refused to marry a rich guy just to spite her family. Instead, she married a guy from a faraway country‚ÄîNew Zealand, a place that wasn‚Äôt even on the map‚Äîan elf named Lathai Loreax. Their love was pure and beautiful... or at least, that was what Regina wanted to think until she saw *it*...

Lathai replaced her dear child‚Äîthe child she bore for nine months‚Äîwith a different child. What? How? How could he do that? Regina immediately investigated and... oh boy. The guy she thought loved her was only using her. Lathai loved another girl named Abigail. Abigail was Lathai‚Äôs first love, his beautiful white moon, the woman he could never forget. And so, Lathai wanted their child to have the best life possible... but Lathai and Abigail could never afford that life... so Regina‚Äôs dear child had to be the sacrifice.

Regina was beyond angry. She named the child **Lucas Loreax**. She forced the child to learn all sorts of skills‚Äîpiano, guitar, Korean, Japanese, Javanese, Vietnamese, etc. Whenever the child failed any test in the 101 subjects he was forced to learn, she hit him, burned him with a flat iron. At age five, his body was filled with scars.

Lathai and Abigail were surprised, but as they were nothing but parasites living off Regina‚Äôs money, they had no say in what Regina did to the son listed in her name on paper. The two cried every night as they watched their dear son get abused by Regina.

Meanwhile, Regina‚Äôs real child‚Äîa daughter, **Iuliana Gentoshi**‚Äîwas transported into a mansion Regina owned, as Regina secretly taught her daughter.

**January of Year 2** Lysander rescued Regina, Duilius (Regina's current and new husband), and Regina's real child, Iuliana. Regina then saw Lucas for the first time in three years. The boy was covered in scars and frostbite‚Äîthe boy whose parents tried to replace her dear daughter Iuliana with... the bastard... Regina asked Lysander to pass her an assault rifle, as she wanted to shoot Lucas' legs off and toy with him. Lysander was surprised by her request, as he viewed it as barbaric, and Kimhyun also denied it. Lysander requested that Regina simply chase Lucas away. As pitiful as Lucas was, it was his parents who were at fault for tricking Regina, and so, he had to bear his parents' sin. Regina did just that. As Lucas cried, shouting ""Mother... mother... I am sorry... let me in..."", Regina smiled as she shot his foot off and forced him to run away from the vault.

**May of Year 2** Albion, led by King Arthur, wanted to establish a trading relationship with the vault. They brought camels to trade in good faith. And of course, the vault agreed.

**July of Year 2** The cold snap finally passed. Iuliana, Regina's true child, proved to be an amazing farmer. She helped with the expansion of the farm. Meanwhile, Duilius was a great rancher. He took care of all the animals and even had his own secret methods for milking cows and collecting honey from bees. As of now, the vault had oats, corn, cocoa, blueberries, honey, milk, tea, and coffee. If in Year 0 the vault only had enough food to survive, by Year 2, thanks to Iuliana and Duilius, it now had a surplus of food and variety. They could now eat lavish meals instead of the plain food they had before. Regina, meanwhile, brought her special recipe for making Tyrian cloth. Regina said that Tyrian cloth was beautiful and used to create a special textile called ‚ÄúRoyal Fabric.‚Äù She declared that with Royal Fabric, their vault would become beautiful, and they could even sell it to other settlements for silver‚Äîthe current apocalyptic currency. Though Regina‚Äôs idea was... unrealistic in an apocalypse, Lysander agreed to try it out. After all, now that they had more resources, a bit of unrealistic dreaming was fine... right?

**September of Year 2** Kimhyun asked Lysander out, wishing to have children with him. Lysander was surprised, as Kimhyun was a man, but Kimhyun said that werewolves could bear children regardless of gender. Lysander, as an SSR fan (and also, Kimhyun was hot), agreed.

**December of Year 2** The comms console received a special Morse code message. It seemed their cousin Yue was having trouble with his current situation. Yue requested shelter in the vault for him and his wife, Hortensia Numitor. Yue was the young heir of the Gentoshi clan, so he was immediately accepted into the vault. Yue brought with him the Golden Grail, said to contain the power of the Sun God.

**April of Year 3** The first batch of Royal Fabric was created with Yue‚Äôs help. Yue also advocated for oil extraction and demanded a small oil refinery to power aircraft. Yue said his wife, Hortensia, could probably control the refinery. Though reluctant, Lysander questioned how they could possibly build an oil refinery in a vault the size of the White House... Then Lysander was shocked as Kimhyun just built it. Apparently, Kimhyun was the SSR Builder‚Äîthe only one who could construct legendary buildings in the world. He easily packed the oil refinery into a tiny room, much to everyone's surprise.

**May of Year 3** A group of Jewish people who had escaped Merkel‚Äôs Holocaust 2.0 had banded together to form the Israelite Trading Guild. They came to the vault, hoping to get to Albion, believing the Moon followers could help them. The Jewish group also wished to barter goods. Initially, Lington wasn‚Äôt keen on trading with a demonized group of people, but just a glance at their goods surprised everyone. How had the Jews managed to collect so many rare items, including forbidden things like the V Serum from Vought? Lysander agreed to bring them to Albion in exchange for some rare weapons. They also bartered many magical grimoires. In return, they were given dresses and clothes.

**August of Year 3** Kimhyun gave birth to a child, Seongha Narukami. Kimhyun wished for his son to be named Gentoshi, but Lysander refused, stating that Seongha needed green eyes‚Äîthe trait that all members of the Gentoshi clan must have to bear the name. Seongha inherited werewolf powers from Kimhyun and matured quickly. He grew into a giant like Kimhyun in no time, reaching the maturity of a 17-year-old rapidly.

**December of Year 3** Seongha and Iuliana got together. Initially, there was pushback from their parents, as they were second cousins, but the pair resisted.

**January of Year 4** Most of the vault went on a quest to recover the ‚ÄúFirst Lifeform‚Äù from a ruin. There, they met Angela, who now had her right leg replaced with a peg leg. The once-beautiful pop sensation was now a lifeless woman, surrounded by her fanbase soldiers, who were no better than she was. Lysander and Yue decided to kidnap Angela from the army and bring her back to the vault. Using Aji‚Äôs Flower Magic, they easily restored Angela‚Äôs right leg. Angela was then asked to stay in the vault. Though she initially refused, she decided to join after seeing how well they were doing.

**April of Year 4** Tlaloc Nonohualco appeared in front of the vault. Tlaloc was a powerful deity‚Äîa direct creation of a primordial god, in her case, the Sun God. Tlaloc asked for shelter while demonstrating her incredible power to raise the dead as shamblers (a form of mindless zombie more related to necromancy than a virus). Tlaloc‚Äôs appearance... simply terrified Lysander and Angela. A deity was of a much higher order than they were‚Äîlike comparing an angel to a saint. Tlaloc declared that she had grown extremely uncomfortable with the SSR the Sun had chosen to conquer the world (The Witch of Weaponry). Hence, Tlaloc wanted to switch sides to a place where the Jester‚Äôs presence was strongest‚Äînamely, the vault, with its two people blessed by the Moon. Lysander planned to defeat Tlaloc through sheer numbers, but Yue said it was better to negotiate than fight. Yue declared that Tlaloc **must** bed Alistair and give them a child to join‚Äîand Tlaloc agreed.

**May of Year 4** As they gathered enough oil, they decided to embark on a long journey to Antarctica to recruit the second SSR: the hero, the legendary blacksmith, Bjorn Stormark. Bjorn was the legendary blacksmith hero who held the secret to the ancient Cryptoforge weapon. He was the last of his kind, as they had been wiped out a hundred years ago by Adolf Hitler during his invasion of Denmark. Bjorn, mesmerized by Angela‚Äôs divine beauty, agreed to join the vault, wishing to bed Angela.





And now, the vault is... surprisingly doing well. They have an oil refining facility, beautiful Royal Fabric furniture, gourmet meals, tea and coffee every two days, and a bunch of animals for wool, meat, and milk.",1,1749918946.0,RimWorld,0,1.0,False

1lbcvw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1lbcvw0/i_think_my_friend_is_having_an_affair_with_a/,I think my friend is having an affair with a married man‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm starting to doubt everything about her.,"I met Julie two years ago when I started working at my current job. I liked her right away  she was one of the first people who talked to me and helped me adapt. A few months later, she transferred to a different role, and we became even closer. What I appreciated most about her was how non-judgmental and accepting she seemed to be toward everyone.
Around that time, I noticed she often spent time with another colleague, Dan. They had lunch together a lot and grabbed coffee almost every morning in the building caf√©. Dan has been at the company for a while. He‚Äôs respected, moved up the ranks to a leadership role, and he‚Äôs married with two young daughters. He‚Äôs also a couple of years older than us.
Once, Julie and I went for coffee and she invited Dan and another colleague to join. I wasn‚Äôt too excited, but I went anyway. I noticed Dan pulled out a chair for Julie, asked what she wanted, and paid for her. Another colleague and I exchanged glances  t felt a little‚Ä¶ off.
I told myself they were just close friends and that he was being kind. But their closeness kept escalating daily breakfasts, lunches, private walks, and a lot of time spent together at work.
Other coworkers started noticing too. One woman from Julie‚Äôs department told me she was certain Julie and Dan were together  that they‚Äôve been seen holding hands in the park, that Dan lies to his guy friends about going to the gym, but actually goes to Julie‚Äôs place. I told her I didn‚Äôt believe it. Julie wouldn‚Äôt do that. She wouldn't destroy a family.
That conversation stuck with me. I brought it up gently with Julie, saying that people were gossiping about her. She smiled and said she knew about the rumors, that people think she‚Äôs sleeping with Dan, and how disgusting that was. That reassured me‚Ä¶ for a while.
Then I started noticing other things. Julie wore Dan‚Äôs shirt once. He buys her snacks, pays for her meals, gives her his clothing, and spends a ton of time with her all while being married. That didn‚Äôt sit right with me.
Julie used to say she had a boyfriend, and I started wondering‚Ä¶ was that Dan all along?
A few months ago, she told me she broke up with her boyfriend because he wouldn‚Äôt commit. She seemed really low like crying during the workday, mood swings, emotional exhaustion. I supported her the best I could.
But I noticed a pattern. When she told me she was texting her ex, she‚Äôd be having breakfast with Dan. When she said she cut contact with him, there‚Äôd be no visible interaction between them at work. I tried not to overthink it.
Yesterday, I casually mentioned to Julie that Dan looked unusually stressed and that he was going gray early. About an hour later, Dan came into our office, brought ice cream for Julie, and said, ‚ÄúYou wanted this, right?‚Äù Odd.
Then he came back again, started talking about midlife crises and how fast he‚Äôs going gray and said something that really unsettled me: that everything we talk about at work can be used against us, that we should only talk about work because people misinterpret things.
This hit me like a brick because I had said something very similar to Julie just 90 minutes earlier.
Now I can‚Äôt stop thinking‚Ä¶ is she telling him everything I say? Has she been sharing even the private things I confided in her?
And worst of all  maybe she really is in a relationship with Dan. Maybe I‚Äôve been in denial.
I feel so confused and lost. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust Julie anymore. I don‚Äôt know who she really is. And this isn‚Äôt just about gossip or morals  this hits close to home. My father cheated on my mom, and I grew up in a house full of pain and silence because of it. For me, relationships with married people are a huge red line. I can‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a big deal.‚Äù
I feel like I‚Äôve lost a friend, or maybe never really knew her at all.",2,1749918897.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

*Four people - 2 adults and 2 young kids, plus 1 dog and 3 cats.*

HHI is \~$230,000. I live in a VHCOL US state, but not in the expensive part of it. So, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre in the HCOL bracket.

*How many meals do you typically prepare at home in a week?*  
We typically prepare 16-19 of our 21 meals at home. We do a takeout night every week, then its not unheard of for me to grab something for breakfast or from the prepared foods section of the grocery store for lunch. I also go out to eat with friends a few times month, but my husband still prepares dinner for himself and the kids those nights.

*Do you have any dietary requirements or goals?*  
Yes, my son has dairy, egg, and peanut allergies and my husband has a peanut allergy. None of their allergies are airborne, so we don‚Äôt keep our home free of the allergens, but obviously this factors heavily into what we cook and eat. I do weekly meal  planning for stress, food waste, and budget management.

Honestly, aside from keeping my son safe, I don‚Äôt have specific goals for us when it comes to food. I have to say no to him so often because of his allergies that I try not to say it for non-allergy reasons much (aka, I‚Äôm fairly lax bout sweets and don‚Äôt stress about the number of chicken nuggets the kids eat). I feel like we do pretty well with a balanced diet and the kids are both great at following their own hunger cues.

*What are your top places to buy groceries?*  
My weekly shopping is at e regional chain called Big Y. It‚Äôs pricier than other options, but they have the best quality of produce and meat available, which I‚Äôm very picky about. They also offer local produce, which I like. Every 4-6 weeks we do a Costco shop for paper goods, frozen foods, and random other stuff. I randomly do some orders/shopping at Walmart and Target because they have some allergy-friendly offerings at better prices (MadeGood and Partake cookies, plant-based cheese, Daiya frozen pizzas, DF ice cream, Lorel‚Äôs Sweets cookie dough). Pet food comes in an autoship from Chewy.

*How well-stocked is your house food-wise?*  
Extremely! We have a large house in suburbia, so we have a pantry and a freezer in the garage. I should do a better job of shopping my own pantry each week, but alas.

# Day 1: Saturday

**Breakfast:** I do a ‚Äúgirl breakfast‚Äù of bits and bobs (coffee, fistful of blueberries, some bites of yogurt, a frozen Belgian waffle). The kids have yogurt and muffins from the freezer stash. My husband has the same breakfast he‚Äôs had almost every day for 10 years: a smoothie with protein powder, flax seed, Greek yogurt, frozen berries, 1/2 a banana and spinach.

**Shopping:** it‚Äôs grocery shopping day! I meal plan every Friday and then shop Saturdays. I also keep a list during the week whatever we run out of. I head to Big Y and get: deli fixings for some meals this week (honey ham from the deli, croissant rolls, cheddar cheese, cotija cheese); yogurt (plain Greek, Siggi‚Äôs plant based for my son; chobani less sugar for my husband); milk, cream, and plant-based butter; frozen ice cream treats for the dog and bird seed for our feeder; pantry staples/random ingredients we‚Äôre low on (kosher salt, Bob‚Äôs Red Mill egg replacer for baking, buckwheat flour, mayonnaise, salsa); boneless chicken thighs; health/beauty items (body wash, Nair cause I hate shaving, hair gel); produce (peaches, green beans which I originally thought were peas; strawberries; spinach; avocados, corn, lemons, potatoes, apples, shallots, and an onion). I grab a double chocolate donut to snack on while I shop because I‚Äôm worth it. **$178.11**

**Food prep:** I like to keep breakfast and snack items on hand for the kids to make mornings easier and we‚Äôre running low, so I spend the afternoon making pink pancakes - they‚Äôve got canned beets, buckwheat flour, yogurt. I personally think they‚Äôre gross but the kids love them lol I make a double batch and it always takes longer than I‚Äôd like, so I only cook half of the batter and vow to finish the rest tomorrow.

**Dinner:** I bought a family pack of wings earlier in the week that I toss in the oven instead of on the grill since it‚Äôs monsooning outside. I serve them with loaded potato rounds, which the kids ignore, and the corn on the cob, which they devour. For dessert we all have some Double Stuf Oreos (fun fact, they are both dairy and egg free!)

# Day 2: Sunday

**Breakfast/food prep:** I spend my morning making the second half of the pink pancakes and the kids scrounge on them as they come off the griddle. I eat a bagel with cream cheese, both of which I already had.

I also make some allergy-friendly cupcakes for the freezer because we‚Äôve got some parties coming up. I had a box cake mix in the pantry, which I make with egg replacer from the pantry and non-dairy milk I had in the fridge. The cupcakes annoyed me two different ways - first, I notice the box now says it makes 22 cupcakes instead of 24. Thanks, shrinkflation. Second, they all stick to my silicone liners and I lose 1/3 of each cupcake.

**Lunch:** we‚Äôre supposed to have pizza and snacks at a family picnic held by the town‚Äôs children‚Äôs museum, so I make my son some Daiya pizza and pack some cupcakes, clementines, and strawberries in case he can‚Äôt have any of the snacks offered. It‚Äôs unseasonably cold and after being at the picnic for an hour with no pizza in sight, we decide to head home. I throw together toasted ham & cheese croissant sandwiches for me and my husband, the previously made pizza for the kids. We all pick at popcorn, chips and strawberries as our side.

**Dinner:** I‚Äôm tired and cranky with no real cause. We‚Äôve also been cooped up all week because of a cold and then so much rain, so we ditch our meal plan and go out for Chinese. We all share an order of General Tso‚Äôs chicken with pork fried rice, a side of white rice, and a PuPu Platter for Two (comes with wings, boneless spare ribs, chicken fingers, crab Rangoon, beef teriyaki, and egg rolls). I threw some Paw Patrol figures and toy airplanes in my bag at the last second and it‚Äôs a good thing I do because service is sloooooow on a Sunday night, but the food is good so it‚Äôs worth it. **$64**

# Day 3: Monday

**Breakfast:** my mother-in-law watches the kids on Mondays and stops at a breakfast spot in town on the way over (cause she‚Äôs awesome). This week I get the California sandwich on ciabatta, which has egg, avocado, tomato, red onion and pepper jack cheese. She always pays but I buy her a gift card a few times a year to chip in. One kid has muffins from the freezer, the other has pink pancakes. Later in the morning, I snack on some mango and mini muffins.

**Lunch:** The kids eat at grandma‚Äôs on Monday, which usually means chicken nuggets, strawberries, and yogurt. Another lunch of ham and cheese croissant sandwiches with popcorn for the parents.  I get distracted while making lunch and burn the ham a bit, so I let my husband know that the chef made our sandwiches ‚Äúslightly blackened‚Äù.

**Dinner:** I picked a recipe from Caro Chamber‚Äôs *What to Cook When You Don‚Äôt Feel Like Cooking* cookbook for lemon garlic shrimp and orzo with peas, but I don‚Äôt actually feel like shrimp today (it‚Äôs been hit or miss for me since I was pregnant with my second, sadly), so I take a skirt steak from the freezer instead. I serve it with the orzo and some garlic ciabatta bread, also from the freezer. This meal uses a lot of what I have on hand - orzo and chicken stock from the pantry, peas from the freezer, and basil from a plant I have on the windowsill. The children ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me cook dinner and then refuse to eat it, which children‚Äôs feeding influencers will claim is impossible but they‚Äôre full of it. One child eats leftover chicken wings and the other claims to be interested in a variety of leftover offerings but in reality only eats air.

**Food prep:** Tuesdays are a preschool day, which means I need to pack lunch and a snack. In addition to the allergies we navigate, the preschool is entirely nut-free, which cuts down on our options even further since tree nuts are not a problem in our house and many dairy-free substitutes are not-based. There‚Äôs still DF pizza from Sunday‚Äôs lunch, so I toss that in the lunchbox with some strawberries, a mini chocolate chip muffin, and a bag of MadeGood double chocolate cookies. For snack, I pack some pink pancakes and a clementine.

# Day 4: Tuesday

**Breakfast:** husband handles kid breakfast while I log on early for work, I hear rumblings about bananas and pink pancakes. I eat a frozen Belgian waffle on the way to preschool drop off, which isn‚Äôt enough so I shove a handful of chocolate coconut almonds into my mouth as well and split an apple with my daughter.

**Lunch:** leftovers from last night (skirt steak, basil orzo with peas) - once again eaten in the car, oops.

**Dinner:** another recipe from Caro Chambers‚Äô cookbook, this one is for one-skillet chicken burrito bowls. It uses the boneless chicken thighs and salsa I bought, plus some pantry staples like rice and chicken stock. It‚Äôs fine, nothing revolutionary but it was easy to put together. I top mine with pickled jalape√±os, sour cream, avocado, Cotija cheese and crushed up Tostitos we had in the pantry. The kids don‚Äôt trust the red-hued rice but happily eat the chicken, chips, and strawberries.

# Day 5: Wednesday

**Breakfast:** Husband‚Äôs on an early morning work call, so I handle breakfast today. The kids see me pull out corn muffins from the freezer and each ask for one. They‚Äôre supposed to be for dinner, but we have enough that I say sure. I grab myself an everything bagel to go with my coffee. I‚Äôm a heathen who loves dairy, so I put both butter (Kerry Gold - the best) and chive cream cheese on top. I worked at a donut and bagel shop during my formative years and am VERY particular about levels of toastage and the amount of schmear.

**Lunch:** chicken burrito bowls again - this time, I add cheddar cheese and hot sauce but omit the pickled jalape√±os.

**Prep:** Another preschool day to pack a lunch for! We still have ham leftover, so I pack that with some Ritz crackers we had in the pantry, strawberries, and 2 packs of MadeGood mini cookies - 2 packs may sound excessive but there are approximately 5 tiny cookies in each bag. And they‚Äôre ridiculously expensive :) :). For snack, I do mini muffins and apple slices since the clementines I usually send have been returning untouched.

**Dinner:** the kids and I have dance class together and then just me on Wednesdays, so I have exactly 30 minutes to get dinner on the table and eat it between studio shuttling. Aka, Wednesday dinners are always a crockpot or freezer stash situation. Today, we have chili and cornbread muffins I froze a few months ago. The kids don‚Äôt like chili and there isn‚Äôt much, so they have nuggets with strawberries and cornbread instead.

**After dance snacking:** my classes wrap up around 9:30 and I feel too adrenaline-y to sleep, so I go to Applebee‚Äôs with some of the gals from class. My sister and I share a 3-for-$15 app deal of chicken wonton tacos, garlic parm boneless wings, and waffle fries. I also order a coke and a Cinnabon dessert. When the bill comes, sissy pays for the apps so my total for the dessert and soda is only **$17.68** with tip.

# Day 6: Thursday

**Breakfast:** I am tired and stressed about/caught up in work, so I forget to make myself something before needing to leave to do preschool drop off and have regrets. When I get home, I have a Belgian waffle from the freezer and half an apple.

**Lunch:** the day has been hectic and I don‚Äôt have much appetite when I‚Äôm stressed so I need something easy. Chicken nuggets and frozen fries from Costco save the day. I use ketchup and honey mustard for dipping as I eat at my desk.

**Dinner:** Thursdays are supposed to be take-out night but my husband isn‚Äôt feeling takeout (note: he‚Äôs better at sticking to ‚Äú1 night per week‚Äù than I am) so he decides to run to the store for supplies. He grabs milk, cream for coffee, potato salad, 2lbs of ground meatloaf mixture, Chinese sausages (pork sausage flavored like Chinese spare ribs), bell peppers, a pineapple, Oreos, and potato chips. He grills the peppers, sausage, and pineapple for dinner, which we have alongside the potato salad. **$52.64**

# Day 7: Friday

**Breakfast:** another morning where I don‚Äôt feel hungry but know I have to eat. I go with a bagel with cream cheese because it‚Äôs easy.

**Lunch:** the kids have a playgroup and then some more grandma time today, so I pack them a lunch box with nuggets, strawberries, clementines, graham crackers and some Partake chocolate chip cookies. My husband has what‚Äôs leftover of the sausage and peppers but it‚Äôs only enough for one. I‚Äôm still stressed (and not very hungry) so I stare at the freezer for a long time before reaching for a box of frozen Gyoza dumplings from Costco. I follow the cooking instructions to a T but they still stick to my pan and completely fall apart, which is annoying. But they taste good, which is not.

**Snacks:** I‚Äôm heading out of town tonight to stay with a friend and attend her bridal shower, so I stop for gas. The station makes me go inside to pay, so obviously I buy some Cheez-it‚Äôs and a graham s‚Äômores bar. Then I also hit up the McDonald‚Äôs drive through because I turn absolutely feral when I only have to feed myself and not my family. I use the McDonald‚Äôs app to get the fries for free since it‚Äôs Friday and also get an iced coffee and a 4 piece nugget. I end up not eating the snacks till my drive home on Sunday but they still felt like a worthwhile investment. **$10.78**

**Shopping:** my husband thinks of more things he should have grabbed for his weekend with the kids, so he goes back to the store for s‚Äômores fixings, clementines, apples, bananas, and frozen Hashbrowns. He also goes to a local market for some cupcakes and dairy-free chocolate. **$45.80**

**Dinner:** I get to my friend‚Äôs a little before 7 and we head right to dinner because we‚Äôre both hungry. We sit outside on the water, which is lovely. She orders a lobster roll and fries, I order a cheeseburger with fries and a coke. Sadly, the coke is flat but the food and company are excelllent. We peruse the dessert menu but nothing speaks to us. My friend insists on paying since I drove down and will be driving us another distance to the shower tomorrow.

**Dessert:** we decide to go to a cookie spot called Chip City, which I‚Äôm excited about. My area recently got a Crumbl and my friend says this place is better. I have a hard time choosing between flavors but settle on a s‚Äômores chocolate chip (can you tell I love this flavor combo?! It‚Äôs such a classic to me and it‚Äôs the start of summer here). My friend chooses a cannoli cookies which looks amazing. I see they have 2 dairy-free offerings and ask if either is also egg-free. The DF chocolate chip cookie is so I grab one for my son - I know he‚Äôs gonna be excited about a giant cookies from the store. They‚Äôre probably one of the things he asks about most at parties, bakeries, stores, etc. I pay for all 3 cookies. My friend and I stay up too late gabbing and eating cookies, just like when we lived together in college. **$15.57**

Seems most shorts screaming the past month or so, 'VOTE NO', are or will be leaving. (Smart ones anyways).

* I added more TLRY shares yesterday. Only the 2nd time I have bought TLRY. Spring of 2024 leading into German legalization the 1st buy, prior Aphria in and out since 2015 to 2021. I'm still upset on that 2024 1st TLRY buy, as I never expected the German roll out could go so bad. Wait months for NEW German 'in country licenses' (that I never realized they needed) after MedCanG came into law, export / import issues... Honestly Tilray was flat and deflating for 6 to 9 months.
* But Tilray Feb 10, 2024 News Release on finally increasing production, shows me they are getting past waiting on cannabis RISKS. That new announced crop was being harvested last month. All sold in 2025 Fiscal Year??? Next NEW Rotation harvested before Q1 2026 closing this summer. Then again before Q2 2026 closing this fall. Q3 2026 closes Feb 28, 2026 with even increased Medical Cannabis and Cannabis Extracts. Tilray will have those 4 increased cannabis production Quarters to bring the Nasdaq stock price back into compliance over $1. I don't think RS will be needed, but a great tool available.

But 1st Tilray needs to also tell the share holders what happened this week with Tilray Beers:

* ""June 11, 2025  Beernet / Craft Business Daily

Ty Gilmore is Leaving Tilray; Prinz Pinakatt Will Lead Beverage Division

Dear Client:  
Big news out of Tilray today: The company is announcing that Ty Gilmore, President, Tilray Beverages, is departing the company. Effective immediately, Tilray's current Chief Growth Officer of Tilray Beverages, Prinz Pinakatt, will step in to lead the beverage division, which includes their beer and non-alc offerings.  ""Ken Bohnet will lead the Tilray Spirits business with Dr Bryan Nolt, Founder of Breckenridge Distillery, and they will collaborate with Prinz to leverage synergies across our beverage business,"" the company shared. [https://beernet.com/cbd/cbd-article/ty-gilmore-is-leaving-tilray-prinz-pinakatt-will-lead-beverage-division/](https://beernet.com/cbd/cbd-article/ty-gilmore-is-leaving-tilray-prinz-pinakatt-will-lead-beverage-division/)

Excellent clean up move for Tilray adding Prinz!

Prinz Pinakatt was the former Global Marketing Director for The Coca-Cola Company. His experience includes building & revitalizing national brands. Additionally, he was the Digital/Interactive Brand Manager for The Coca-Cola Company in Europe.

Remember Ty was well liked and his experience came from distribution.

Tilray buying up NON appreciated Craft Beer brands, these last 12 breweries for pennies on the dollar from Global Beverages operators like Molson Coors and Anheuser-Busch InBev, certainly requires someone with REVITALIZING knowledge.

Good Move Tilray promoting Prinz,  Good Luck Ty

* ONE further RISK I'm concerned TLRY maybe waiting on is ""Infused Delta 9"" brews? The 1st 6 month roll out was  pathetic. $1.4M in 2 quarters? Many firms are doing that monthly!
* Going back to Irwin Simon's closing remarks April 8. Q3 Conference Call: ""Thank you all for joining us today. As we look ahead, we see tremendous opportunities to grow our beverage business, and that includes adding more breweries to our portfolio. With prices where they are now, it‚Äôs a great time to invest in these assets and build out our capabilities.""
* Will the 3 idled Beverages be Retrofit to Infused Brews, Non Alc, Energy drinks? Revolver Brewery, Texas, Hops Valley, Oregon & Redhook, Washington.

Quote from Brauwelt  24 October 2024:

""Tilray paid only USD 23 million for Molson Coors‚Äô craft breweries""

""With its latest acquisitions, Tilray has truly become a roll-up of cast-off breweries. Hence it is only paying token values. On a positive note, it is hoping to rescue a few of these brands from the trash bin.""

NOTE: KEY WORDS ""RESCUE A FEW""

Tilray by gaining Atwater in Michigan, just voted BEST BEER & BEST BREWERY/BAR in Detroit & Michigan state is likely a bargain. Terrapin also doing well in the USA SE.

Tilray now has #1 Craft Beers in:

# 1 Metro NY with Montauk,

# 1 Georgia & the SE with Sweetwater,

# 1 Pacific NW with 10 Barrel,

# 1 Detroit & Michigan with Atwater

Tilray has expanded in Craft Beverages in the USA from 2023 rated @ #9 to fall 2023 #5 and fall 2024 to #4, which is 125% increase in sales in just 2 years.

WHO EXPANDS THAT FAST?

Really, Tilray has handled expansion well by buying at penny's on the dollar, taking the Top breweries, but the deals included some 'fixer uppers' which will likely be retrofitted to be INFUSED BEVERAGES DISTILLERIES, as Ty Gilmour requested July 16, 2024 on a BevNet Podcast.

https://brauwelt.com/en/international-report/the-americas/647458-tilray-paid-only-usd-23-million-for-molson-coors%E2%80%99-craft-breweries#:\~:text=Tilray's%20latest%20SEC%20filing%20(10,Molson%20Coors%20must%20have%20paid.

""Craft brewery valuations must be at rock bottom.""

I hope we can see Tilray ""grow our beverage business"".

* I'm still looking at Splash Beverages Group out of Fort Lauderdale Fl. I think a good deal buy out would be under 1% of 2026 Revenue?

Splash Beverage Group Overview Splash Beverage Group (NYSE American: SBEV) is a portfolio company managing a diverse range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage brands, including Copa di Vino (wine by the glass), 'SALT' a flavored tequilas, Pulpoloco sangria, and TapouT performance hydration drinks. The company focuses on acquiring and accelerating early-stage or innovative brands with high visibility, leveraging a three-tier distribution system and an e-commerce platform (Qplash). Splash emphasizes sustainable packaging, natural ingredients, and health-conscious products. As of April 2025, its stock price was $1.38, with a market cap of $2.14M and trailing twelve-month revenue of $6.26M. The company has pursued growth through mergers and acquisitions (M&A), recently signing a letter of intent (LOI) to acquire Western Son Vodka.

Tilray could consider acquiring Splash Beverage Group as part of its beverage portfolio expansion, but several factors would influence the feasibility and strategic fit:

* Splash‚Äôs portfolio, including tequila, sangria, wine, and performance drinks, aligns with Tilray‚Äôs focus on diversifying into alcoholic and functional beverages. SALT Tequila and Pulpoloco Sangria could complement Tilray‚Äôs craft beer and spirits assets, while TapouT could compete in the growing functional beverage market, similar to Tilray‚Äôs  Hi\*Ball Energy brand. (+Medmen energy?)
* Splash‚Äôs emphasis on natural ingredients, sustainable packaging (e.g., Pulpoloco‚Äôs CartoCan), and health-focused products fits Tilray‚Äôs consumer trends-driven approach.
* Tilray‚Äôs robust distribution network, including partnerships with major distributors like Reyes Beverage Group, could enhance Splash‚Äôs reach, particularly for brands like Copa di Vino, which has secured retail placements with Walmart and Total Wine & More. Conversely, Splash‚Äôs three-tier distribution system could support Tilray‚Äôs alcohol brands.
* Splash‚Äôs recent LOI for Western Son Vodka used a stock-for-equity model with minimal cash (10%), which Tilray could replicate to minimize upfront costs.
* Splash‚Äôs liquidity constraints and declining e-commerce revenue (Splash down 97% in Q2 2024) suggest operational challenges that Tilray would need to address post-acquisition. Just completed a RS. Its a TRUE 'Fixer Upper"".
* Splash‚Äôs M&A strategy, led by new **CFO Julius Ivancsits (formerly of Hexo, acquired by Tilray)**, could align with Tilray‚Äôs acquisition expertise. However, integrating Splash‚Äôs small team (32 employees) and fragmented portfolio could strain Tilray‚Äôs resources. But Tilray would split the Splash group into 3 different divisions not pushing all onto a single group.
* Tilray could add Splash Beverage Group to its portfolio, as Splash‚Äôs innovative brands and sustainable focus align with Tilray‚Äôs beverage diversification strategy. The acquisition would be financially feasible given Splash‚Äôs low market cap, and distribution synergies could enhance both companies‚Äô reach. However, Splash‚Äôs financial struggles, declining revenues, and potential brand overlap pose risks.

I like their flavoured Tequila's add in Infused with THC [https://splashbeveragegroup.com/](https://splashbeveragegroup.com/)

from Dec 2022:

""Tilray CEO Irwin Simon likes building brands. At the helm of the multi-category cannabis firm, he has been busy acquiring craft brewers and spirit distillers in the US in preparation for his long-term goal: to launch THC- and CBD-infused versions of the original alcohol beverage brands he‚Äôs accumulating.""

I‚Äôm looking to meet a woman around my age who also loves Jesus and desires a Christ-centered relationship. Whether you‚Äôre more introverted or outgoing, what matters most to me is a heart for God and a desire to grow together spiritually and emotionally.

# LatentView Analytics ‚Äì The ‚Çπ6,500 Cr Silent Assassin of Indian IT

# TL;DR:

* 90% of revenue from exports
* Not IT services, but **data analytics-as-a-service**
* Clients include **PepsiCo, Uber, Adobe, Nestle**
* Asset-light, zero debt, 30%+ RoCE
* Trading at 53x trailing PE ‚Äî but‚Ä¶ is it worth it?

# üß† What Does LatentView Actually Do?

This isn‚Äôt your typical Infosys-style body-shopping IT firm. **LatentView is a pure-play analytics company** that helps global firms:

* Predict consumer behavior (demand forecasting, churn detection)
* Optimize marketing spends (digital analytics, media ROI)
* Automate dashboards and reporting
* Build AI/ML models (mostly for marketing, supply chain, and finance)

They aren‚Äôt selling generic software or developer hours. They sell **analytics insights** ‚Äî think of them as the brainy data partner behind major Fortune 500 decisions.

# üìà The Business Model

* **80%+ of revenue from the US**, entirely in USD
* 30‚Äì35 large clients, but highly concentrated: Top 5 bring in \~65% of revenue
* High-margin consulting + execution work
* Recurring revenue through long-term analytics contracts

They operate in the **‚ÄúData Analytics Value Chain‚Äù**:

1. **Data Engineering** ‚Äì Getting the data pipeline in place
2. **Business Analytics** ‚Äì Visualizations, dashboards
3. **Predictive Modeling** ‚Äì AI/ML use cases
4. **Digital Solutions** ‚Äì Deployment across the org

# üßæ Clients & Use Cases

# PepsiCo

* Sales forecasting, demand analytics, pricing optimization
* LatentView helps them predict which SKUs to push in which regions

# Adobe

* Digital campaign performance measurement
* Attribution modeling, channel ROI

# Uber

* Driver supply-demand balancing analytics
* Surge pricing logic and rider behavior segmentation

# üí∏ Financials (FY24)

|Metric|Value (‚Çπ)|Value (USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|‚Çπ580 crore|**$70 million**|
|EBITDA Margin|25.8%|‚Äî|
|PAT|‚Çπ140 crore|**$16.9 million**|
|RoCE|31%|‚Äî|
|RoE|20%+|‚Äî|
|Cash Reserves|‚Çπ850 crore|**$102 million**|
|Capex|Negligible|‚Äî|

It‚Äôs an **asset-light, high cash-gen machine.**

# üìä Valuation Snapshot (as of June 2025)

* **Market Cap**: ‚Çπ6,500 crore (**$783 million**)
* **PE (TTM)**: \~53x
* **EV/EBITDA**: \~37x
* **PEG**: 1.9 (assuming 28% CAGR over next 3 years)
* **FCF Yield**: \~2.2% (conservative due to cash hoarding)

Valuation is rich ‚Äî no doubt ‚Äî but it‚Äôs **not SaaS-crazy**. Given zero debt, high client retention, and global pricing power, you‚Äôre paying up for stability + upside.

# üìâ Why So Quiet?

Despite strong financials, the stock has **underperformed** post-IPO:

* IPO came at ‚Çπ197 in late 2021 ‚Üí Peaked at ‚Çπ690 ‚Üí Now \~‚Çπ320
* No flashy contracts or hype cycles
* Low analyst coverage
* High client concentration = risk
* Slow but consistent growth ‚Äî **not a moonshot**

But under the hood, every metric is improving.

# üîé The Differentiator

This isn‚Äôt Wipro. This is **Accenture-lite in analytics**:

* Laser-focused on data ‚Äî not code
* Premium clients in high-margin industries
* 80%+ employee base in India, serving global analytics roles
* Founder/Chairman still involved; company culture = low attrition

It‚Äôs the rare IT play that‚Äôs **non-linear**: growth doesn‚Äôt mean adding headcount blindly.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks

1. **Client Concentration**: Top 5 = 65%+ revenue
2. **Slow Revenue Growth**: 15‚Äì18% CAGR, not flashy
3. **Talent Retention**: High-end analytics folks are hard to retain
4. **No Proprietary IP**: They‚Äôre a services firm, not product-led
5. **Valuation Compression Risk**: At 53x PE, any earnings miss hurts

# üß† The Bet

You're betting that:

* **Analytics-as-a-service** keeps growing in large enterprises
* LatentView continues to **upsell more services** to existing Fortune 500 clients
* There‚Äôs a re-rating as investors realize this isn‚Äôt mid-tier IT, but something more niche
* Profit compounding quietly continues while cash piles up

Is this  a **coffee-can stock** for your portfolio‚Äôs ‚Äúboring compounding‚Äù bucket.  
Can it become a ‚Çπ20,000 crore ($2.4B) company on 3x revenue and 30% margins? I really want to know.

# So, What‚Äôs Your View on LatentView as an Investment?

Too expensive? Or a stealth compounding machine priced for its edge?
