So I just got them all in the parcels over the past two days and I got:

1. Taskeen Lactea Divina by Paris Corner: Listen, I used to not be into lactonic scents (I'm so sorry Bianco Latte lovers but I wasn't a fan of the sample I got 😭) but as soon as I got this one- MY, MY. I was in love of the mix of milky vanilla with a hint of white floral notes. I was expecting this to be more floral but gosh the projection just got better and better on me. Lasts on skin beautifully- literally smelled it on my wrist after 7 hours even after gym.

2. YSL Black Opium Over Red: I got this because I was on the hunt for a cherry perfume that had a little bit of an edge and I thought coffee was a good note to mix it with. Wasn't expecting much considering the Black Opium line has kind of disappointed me but this has got to be one of the best ones I've smelled yet. I've read that to some others the cherry doesn't pull much on them but to me I can actually smell it more than the coffee notes. Less white florals which doesn't faze me. Projection isn't as good but I wasn't disappointed!

3. By Rosie Jane Madie EDP - Beach in a bottle. Just got it from the Sephora sale recently. Reminds me of Beach Walk from Replica or even a hint of TF Soleil Blanc due to the hint of floral notes and sunscreen/tanning oil vibe scent. Doesn't really last long on me as I tried to wear it on a day out but I wouldn't mind reapplying if I felt like having that scent for the day. Otherwise, wouldn't really say much as I think the scent isn't too strong nor unique.

I decided to cut out coffee and caffeine completely. I used to drink about two cups a day, but today marks day 3 without any coffee at all. Since quitting, the itchiness has stopped, which is a good sign. I do feel more tired than usual, but I’m trying to rest and let my body adjust.

This is my first photo documenting the process from 3 days ago. I’ll keep updating here to track any changes. If you’ve experienced anything similar or have tips, I’d love to hear from you. Thanks for reading!",1,1744862736.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1k13yl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k13yl5/the_spare_room/,The Spare Room,"This might be nothing, but I have had this gnawing feeling in my stomach ever since I got back from my cousin’s place. And after what happened last night…I just need to get this out.

So I stayed at my cousin Tyler’s house for a few days while I was in town for work. He’s kind of a weird guy, lives alone in this older two-story house near the edge of the woods. Not run-down or anything—just…creaky.

Like it remembered being someone else’s house longer than it has been his.

As if it was waiting for someone who never came back.

Or maybe never got the chance.

The upstairs felt heavier. Like the house was quieter there, but not empty. Like it was waiting for someone small to come back.

He offered me the spare bedroom upstairs, which was nice.

Said no one ever uses it after his mom passed, so it was “all mine.” Though that somehow made me feel even worse. Like I was borrowing something that hadn’t been unwrapped yet.

 

I had not thought about his mom in years. She died when we were teens. I barely remembered her, just that she always kept one door in the house closed. Never went upstairs. Always smelled faintly like baby powder

But the first weird thing happened right when I got there: when he showed me the room, he didn’t step inside. Just opened the door and stood in the hallway.

“Don’t leave the closet door open,” he said.

He didn’t say why. Just tapped the doorframe twice, like he was confirming it heard him.

His fingers tapped the frame like a knock—rhythmic, almost rehearsed. Like a lullaby played backwards.

I laughed, thinking he was joking, but he didn’t smile. Tyler tapped the doorframe twice and said, “Just keep it shut. I have had issues.”

When I asked what kind of issues, he shrugged. “It creaks. Makes noise at night. Doesn’t matter if you hear it or not, just keep it closed.”

I thought that was a weird way to phrase it—“doesn’t matter if you hear it or not.” It sat with me longer than it should have. But whatever. Every house has its quirks.

The room was clean, barely used.

But there was a chipped baseboard with faded pink paint beneath the white. Like it had once been a different room for a different someone.

My eyes drifted to a spot near the closet where the wallpaper peeled in the shape of something square—like a toy shelf had once been there. But the square was too low. Lower than eye-level.

Like it had waited for someone smaller.

Someone who never got tall.

[Update: 1]

First night, nothing happened. The bed was stiff, the room a little too cold.

I kept the closet shut. Just like he said. I even made sure the latch clicked.

At some point during the night, I woke up. No reason. Just suddenly wide awake. The room felt different. Still quiet, but wrong.

The closet door was open.

Not wide—just a few inches. But enough.

I got up, muttering to myself, annoyed more than anything. Probably didn’t close it right. I shut it again, harder this time, and went back to bed.

I didn’t hear it creak. Didn’t feel the air shift.

No hinges.

Just…open.

Like it had always been that way and I had simply remembered it wrong.

I thought of a kid’s game—peekaboo, maybe. The kind that teaches you something disappears when you’re not looking. And returns…different.

And yet I had this weird thought as I was falling back asleep: If I didn’t hear it open, maybe it didn’t use the hinges.

[Update: 2]

Second night. I was more careful.

Tyler had gone to bed early—he sleeps on the couch downstairs, doesn’t even use the second floor. I asked him again about the closet thing, and he got vague.

“It used to be a nursery,” he said. “My mom never let me sleep in there either. Said it held on to things.”

There was a hesitation in his voice when he said “nursery.” Like he hadn’t said that word aloud in a long time.

Tyler did not look at the room.

He just sipped his coffee like it wasn’t the first time he’d tried to forget that sentence.

That did not help.

I shut the closet tight again. Wedged a chair under the knob just for good measure. I even took a photo to prove to myself I did it.

I woke up at 3:12 AM. Not from a sound—but from movement.

The chair was across the room.

And the closet door was open again.

This time wider. At least a foot.

The air felt thick. Like it was waiting for me to notice.

I didn’t go near it. Just turned on every light I could and stayed up until dawn.

I swear I heard whispering under the bed. Not words. Just…a mouth trying to remember how to speak. Like a kid trying to remember how to form words. Not like it forgot—but like no one had listened for a very long time.

Like someone reenacting a bedtime story no one read to them.

[Update: 3]

I asked Tyler one more time if he has ever actually seen anything in there.

He didn’t answer at first. Just sipped his coffee. Then he said: “If it likes you, it doesn’t hide.”

I laughed. “So what happens if it doesn’t like you?”

He didn’t laugh back.

“Don’t sleep facing the wall,” he said.

He didn’t say it like a warning. He said it like a rule he had already broken once.

I think he wanted to say more. But he just looked upstairs like someone who knows which stairs not to wake.

That night, he left a note on the kitchen table in his handwriting. Just three words: DON’T TURN OVER.

The paper he used had faint ink impressions beneath the message—loops and scratchy curves, like someone childish had drawn over it before.

[Update: 4]

Last night was my final night there. I broke every rule.

I was exhausted. I just wanted sleep. I didn’t check the closet. I didn’t check the chair. And I fell asleep facing the wall.

I woke up because something shifted on the mattress.

Not weight, exactly. More like a pulling. A tension.

I rolled over slowly. The room was dark.

But I heard breathing. Under the bed.

Not loud. Not gasping. Just slow, deep inhales. Like something sleeping downward. Like lungs stretched in the wrong direction.

It sounded like something was trying to match mine. Not mimic. Sync. Like it wanted to sleep the way I did.

I wanted to get up. I wanted to run. But something cold brushed my ankle.

I whispered: “I know you are there. Knock it off.”

It waited. As if that was the signal.

And the breathing stopped.

Nothing moved. But I felt the wrongness settle around me like static.

Then came the scratching.

It was not random. It was searching for the seam. The one that let things through.

It started slow—like one finger tracing the underside of the mattress. Then more joined in. Light at first. Curious. Then harder. Urgent.

The mattress groaned. I could feel the springs warping beneath me as if something was pushing up, slowly trying to get through.

I stayed frozen. Every muscle in my body screamed to move, but I couldn’t. The scratching became rhythmic. It sounded almost like…like it was digging. Inside the mattress.

When it finally stopped, there was a pause. Silence. Then, a whisper—not under the bed, but in my pillow, next to my ear:

“Still facing me.”

I didn’t scream. I couldn’t. My throat felt locked. I waited until sunrise before moving. When I finally got up, I saw the closet was closed. And the chair was back under the knob.

Except it was not the chair I remembered seeing. This one was old.

Too small.

The kind you would find in a classroom—or a nursery. The varnish was cracked like it had dried out waiting to be used.

There were faded stickers on the underside.

One looked like it used to be a cartoon face.

A smile, worn away.

One of the stickers looked like it had been peeled off and stuck back on again. Like someone couldn’t bear to throw it away.

I touched the chair once. The wood felt soft, like it had been held by smaller hands for years.

I don’t know why, but I checked underneath it.

Scratched into the grain—five tallies. The last one fresh. Like something was still counting. Still keeping score in a game no one had finished.

I am home now.

I wanted to text Tyler. Just to ask if he ever turned over.

But I did not.

I think he already told me.

Not with words.

With the way he never goes upstairs.

The way he taps the doorframe like a promise he broke once. The way he never, ever says goodnight.

And just ten minutes ago, I heard a noise in my room.

A tiny creak.

And when I turned, my closet door was open.

I always leave it shut.

There are letters etched into the wood:

“Thank you for turning over. I knew you would.”

Beneath it, drawn faintly in blue crayon: a stick figure. Arms open wide.
Five lines above the head—like candles.

Or birthday wishes.

A smile too wide.

39M here on a mission to turn things around—body, mind, and lifestyle. I know the playbook: eat clean (keto or low-carb works best for me), move regularly, and sleep like it’s my job. But let’s be honest - I suck at consistency.

That’s why I’m here.

I’m trying to find my tribe... accountability partners (Millennials, Gen Z folks—any gender)—who are serious about long-term health and fitness goals. Just real people who want to check in regularly, hype each other up, and build something meaningful. Think fitness chats, progress updates, shared struggles, and maybe even lifelong friendship 🫂 if the vibe’s right ✨.

A bit about me: introvert alert—but not shy. I don’t usually kick off the convo, but once I click with someone, I go full ""talks a mile a minute"" mode. I connect deeply, I’m all in, and I love cheering people on.

I’m based in Bangalore, India, and while I’d love to connect with folks from anywhere, if you’re in Bangalore too—we could even plan the occasional in-person workout or coffee check-in.

If you're looking to:

Eat better 🍳

Move more 🏋️‍♂️

Sleep smarter 😴

And actually stay consistent ✅

## What is Token Tact?

**Token Tact** is a relatively new automated trading platform that uses smart algorithms to help users make trades in crypto, forex, stocks, and other assets. It’s designed to be beginner-friendly but still packs enough features to attract more seasoned traders.

The platform claims to use **AI-driven models** to analyze market trends in real-time and execute trades at optimal times. Whether or not you're a chart-reading wizard, Token Tact is supposed to do the heavy lifting for you—making it appealing if you're short on time or just getting started.

## Who Created Token Tact?

The team behind Token Tact isn’t exactly front and center, which is pretty common for platforms in the fintech space. While there’s no big-name founder like Elon Musk or Brian Armstrong (no relation 😎), the platform appears to be backed by a group of developers and analysts with experience in finance and software development.

That said, I’d like to see a little more transparency here. A public-facing team would help build trust, especially for a platform handling people’s money.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Token Tact Today](https://tinyurl.com/3e3zf5yw)
## How Does Token Tact Work?

Token Tact operates using **automated trading bots** that scan the market for real-time opportunities. You set up your preferences—like how much risk you’re okay taking, what assets you're into, and how active you want to be—and the platform takes it from there.

The bots analyze market data, historical trends, and trading signals to place trades on your behalf. You can step in and make manual trades too, but the main appeal is kind of a “set it and forget it” vibe. Think of it like cruise control for your investing.

## Token Tact Pros and Cons

Here’s my honest take after poking around and using it for a bit.

### Pros

- **Easy to use** – The interface is super clean and intuitive.
- **Supports multiple assets** – Crypto, stocks, forex, you name it.
- **AI-powered trading** – Helps analyze the market without needing a PhD in economics.
- **Demo account** – Great for practicing before putting real money in.
- **Mobile-friendly** – Works smoothly on both desktop and phones.

### Cons

- **Minimum deposit of $250** – Not outrageous, but still a barrier for some.
- **Lack of transparency** – Would be nice to know more about the team behind it.
- **Limited manual controls** – If you’re a control freak with your trades, this might annoy you.

Do they sleep between floors, remembering the people they've carried—or the ones they've taken?”

Strange thought, isn’t it? But after everything that’s happened, I’ve started wondering: What if elevators aren’t just machines? What if they’re passageways… and something *else* is riding them too?

I’m not writing this for attention. Hell, I don’t even know why I’m writing at all. Maybe I just need it out of me, like bleeding out poison. This story isn’t something I want to carry anymore. Maybe, by putting it into words, I can leave some of it behind.

So here it is. What happened to me. Word for word.

It started ordinary—don’t they all?

I’d just landed a new job. Pay was solid, hours manageable, and after years of cramped apartments and Craigslist roommates, I could finally afford a place of my own. Something clean. Modern. Uncomplicated.

Nova Tower looked like the future—floors of steel, glass, and silence. No creaky pipes, no cigarette-stained walls, no nosy neighbors. Just polished marble, scentless air, and that eerie kind of cleanliness that feels… *surgical*.

They advertised their AI-run systems like a badge of honor. Climate control, automatic blinds, smart lighting that matched your circadian rhythm. But what caught my eye was the elevator.

“No buttons,” the leasing agent had said, beaming like it was the cure for cancer. “Just step in, and it’ll detect your destination based on your movement patterns, facial recognition, and biometric signals.”

Sounded cool. Slick. Efficient. I didn’t think twice.

But now, I’d give anything to unstep into that place. To un-meet that elevator. To un-know what I know.

It was late. One of those wet, miserable Friday nights where the sky feels like it’s trying to crush you.

I was soaked to the bone—suit clinging, socks squishing in my shoes, a sheen of cold crawling down my spine. All I wanted was a hot shower and the mindless hum of late-night TV.

I nodded at the night concierge as I passed. He didn’t nod back.

Just stared. Eyes bloodshot. Jaw clenched. Hands gripping the counter like it was holding him down.

I hesitated. Only for a second. Then shook it off.

Whatever. Maybe he was having a bad night.

The elevator opened with a sound like a sigh—low and long, not quite mechanical. I stepped in, ready to zone out.

But something on the floor caught my eye. A slip of paper. Lying dead center in the middle of the floor, water-warped, ink bleeding at the edges.

I picked it up, expecting trash, maybe a lost grocery list.

Instead, I read it under the flickering light:

RULES FOR USING THE ELEVATOR AFTER 10 PM:

* Only ride to even-numbered floors.
* Do not speak, even if someone talks to you.
* If the elevator stops at Floor 13, do not exit. Close your eyes and wait.
* If the elevator asks you a question, do not answer.
* Leave immediately if someone steps in without a reflection.
* If your reflection is wrong, blink... until it looks normal again.

I snorted. “Urban legends in Helvetica.” 

I remember smiling. One of those weak, half-laughs you make when you’re alone and weirded out.

But something about the way it was written—the shaky handwriting, the way “do not exit” was underlined three times—made my skin crawl a little. 

I checked my watch. 10:07 PM. Maybe someone was just messing around. Cute prank. Halloween must’ve come early. Whatever.

Still, I folded the paper and slipped it into my jacket pocket. Some part of me—a smaller, quieter part—didn’t want to just toss it.

Not yet.

The doors slid shut. Smooth. Silent. The elevator started moving. Nothing happened.

I got off on Floor 12. My apartment. Warm light. White walls. Normal.

But now… I look back at that moment like it was the last time I stood on safe ground.

They say curiosity is a slow kind of death. Not sharp and quick—but a whisper, a tug, a splinter beneath the skin.

Three nights later, it whispered again.

It was almost midnight. I’d stayed late at work. 

The rain was back—angrier this time. Like the sky was trying to peel the city open.

The city outside was still soaked, streets gleaming like oil, air thick and heavy with that end-of-storm stillness.

I was tired. But also… curious.

You know that feeling when you *know* something’s a bad idea but your brain whispers, “Yeah, but what *if*?”

That’s what happened.

I stepped into the elevator. My apartment was on the 12th.But the thought crept in. What happens if I *don’t* follow the rule?

I said nothing out loud. Just stared at the black glass panel above the door.

15, I thought.

I wanted to see what was on the 15th. There was a rooftop lounge—supposedly gorgeous views. I hadn’t checked it out yet.

So, I stepped in. Waited.

The elevator accepted the command. No sound. Just movement.

It ascended like a ghost—no shudder, no gear sounds, just a rising emptiness in my stomach as the numbers ticked upward.

10… 12… 14… 15.

The doors opened.

And the rooftop lounge was gone.

Black. Not dim. Not poorly lit. *Black.*

The kind of black that has *depth*. That feels like it's breathing.

I stepped forward instinctively, as if testing if the floor still existed. The air was freezing. A cold that bypassed my skin and latched straight onto my bones.

“Hello?” I said.

My voice sounded wrong. Too loud. Too swallowed.

No answer. Just my own voice echoing back—flat and dead.

Then—*tap. tap. tap.* Footsteps. Deliberate. Soft. Slow.

Behind me.

I spun.

No one.

The sound stopped. The silence screamed.

Then—closer this time—*tap. tap. tap.*

My heart beat like a sledgehammer. I turned again.

Still nothing. But it felt like the dark itself had teeth.

I backed away, breath short. I could feel it—*eyes*. Watching. *Smiling.* Not with kindness.

I lunged for the elevator, slamming my hand against the inside wall like it was a lifeline.

The doors slid shut. The elevator dropped.

And that’s when I looked in the mirror.

My reflection wasn’t… right.

It looked like me. Wore my soaked coat. Had my nervous stance.

But the eyes were hollow. And the mouth—

The mouth smiled.

Not in joy. Not even in madness.

It was a knowing smile. Like it had seen what I hadn’t yet. Like it was *waiting* for me to catch up.

I blinked. And everything snapped back to normal.

The mirror showed *me*. Just me. Sweating. Pale. Shaking.

But that wasn’t relief—it was worse.

It meant something had *gotten in*.

When the doors opened to Floor 12, I didn’t walk—I ran. Keys trembling in my hand. Door slammed. Locks clicked.

Lights on. All of them. TV volume maxed just to fill the air with *anything*.

I didn’t sleep that night.

But that was only the beginning.

Days passed. But something had shifted in me.

I started avoiding the elevator like it owed me money. Took the stairs. Faked phone calls in the lobby. Made excuses to stay out late or leave early—whatever it took to avoid those smooth, whisper-quiet doors.

I tried to forget. Told myself I was sleep-deprived. Stressed. Seeing things.

But I kept the note like It was a trapdoor warning. I didn’t throw it away. I couldn’t. Something in me *knew* it wasn’t just paranoia. 

Because Nova Tower wasn’t built for paranoia. It was built for compliance. And climbing twelve flights of stairs every day starts to wear on you in a way that seeps into your muscles and makes you careless.

It was a Thursday night. Nearly 11 PM.I had my laptop in one hand, a coffee in the other.

I gave in again. Late shift. Rain again. Exhausted. My logic overpowered the fear: *It was just a glitch. A fluke. An overactive imagination.* Right?

The elevator sat in wait like a predator with a velvet grin.

I stepped in. The doors closed behind me like a secret being kept.

The usual synthetic voice came to life:

“Good evening, Liam.”

Polite. Crisp. Neutral.

“Evening,” I muttered back, half out of habit.

The elevator hummed softly. Began its ascent.

But then, halfway up, it *stopped*.

Not a gradual slowdown. Not the smooth deceleration I’d grown used to.

It *halted*. Hard. Like the air itself had seized.

The lights flickered. Once. Twice. Then dimmed to a dull, sickly yellow.

And the voice returned. But different this time.

Lower. Closer. *More human.*

“Liam…”

I felt the blood drain from my face.

The voice was almost *gentle*, like a lover waking you from a nightmare.

“Do you trust me?”

I didn’t answer. Couldn’t. My jaw locked tight, throat dry as dust.

The silence after the question was unbearable. Not quiet—*expectant*. Like something was *watching* and waiting. Leaning in. Breathing down my neck.

Then again, slower this time:

“Liam… do you trust me?”

The air thickened. My heartbeat thundered in my ears. I felt like I was shrinking inside my skin.

I wanted to scream, but all I could manage was a whisper:

“No.”

And everything went black.

I felt it before I heard it.

The sensation of *falling*. A sudden, violent drop, like the floor had just given up.

The lights died completely. The elevator screamed—a deep, metallic howl like it was being torn apart from the inside.

I crashed into the ceiling, then the floor, then the wall, tumbling weightless in all directions at once.

My hands clawed at cold steel. My knees slammed against the ground. My head struck something hard.

Still falling. Still falling. Still—

Suddenly, Silence.

The elevator shuddered. Stopped.

Then—*ding.*

The doors slid open like nothing had happened.

Floor 12.

Lights normal. Lobby music playing softly through the speakers like I hadn’t just stared into the throat of hell.

I crawled out. Couldn’t even stand.

My chest heaved. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I gagged, dry-heaving on the hallway floor.

I stumbled back to my apartment and didn’t come out for two days.

But After that night, I swore I’d never ride the elevator past 10 again.

I tried taking the stairs for a while. Twelve floors. Not fun. But better than being trapped in that steel coffin with a voice that *knew my name.*

At first, I thought I could just avoid it. Use it only during the day. Follow the rules. Stay safe.

But the building didn’t care. The rules? They weren’t safeguards. They were… *agreements*. You break them, even by accident, and something *not human* notices.

And it doesn’t forget.

Subtle things started shifting. My apartment door would be ajar when I came home, even though I *knew* I’d locked it.

The AI butler would glitch, calling me by the wrong name: “Hello, Mr. Anders,” it’d say.

But there *was* no Mr. Anders.

The neighbors started acting strange, too. I passed a woman on my floor—Mrs. Greene, I think. Nice old lady, always wore bright lipstick.

But her smile was off. Too wide. And she whispered, *“Going down, Liam?”* Just that.

Not *hi*. Not *good evening*. Just that.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t even breathe until I was back inside my apartment.

I started leaving all the lights on. Music playing constantly. Anything to drown out the silence.

But it kept seeping in. The building had a way of pressing against you. Like it was trying to get *into* you.

I wish I could say I learned my lesson.

But the tower... *it doesn’t let you forget*. The elevator started *showing up* in my dreams.

Always the same: doors opening onto a hallway that shouldn’t exist. Flickering lights. Peeling wallpaper. And something *standing* at the far end, unmoving. Watching.

Eventually, life forces you back into routine. Even nightmares can become familiar.

I convinced myself I’d follow the rules. Never speak. Never go to odd floors. Never answer questions.

One night, When I was exhausted, sleep-deprived and barely functioning. I told myself: Just use the elevator. Follow the rules. You’ll be fine.

So I did. I waited until 9:40 PM. Early enough, I thought.

I stepped in that night, alone. head down, mind blank.

“Floor twelve,” I said clearly. Just once.

The elevator obeyed. Began to rise.

The numbers blinked upward. 4… 6… 8…

Then something changed.

The panel flickered. Buzzed.

The numbers scrambled—8… 10… 12… 13.

No.

There’s no 13th floor. There *wasn’t supposed* to be a 13th floor. I stared in disbelief.

The elevator slowed. Stopped.

Ding.

The doors slid open.

What I saw… I still can’t fully explain.

The hallway stretched on forever. Walls the color of rot. Carpet worn to the threads. Water stains bleeding down the ceiling like veins.

And at the end—A figure.

Human-shaped. Completely still. Shrouded in shadows. Too far to see details, but close enough to *feel*.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

My instincts screamed, Shut your eyes. Shut them. Don’t look.

So I did. Tight. Every muscle locked.

The air changed. Grew heavy. Cold. Wet. Like fog creeping under my skin.

I whispered to myself, over and over:

“Close the doors. Please. Please close.”

The elevator groaned, like something ancient had to be convinced to move.

It felt like an eternity.

Finally—click.

The doors sealed shut, nearly catching my sleeve. The elevator rose. My eyes snapped open.

I didn’t see the figure again. But I *felt* it.

It’s like the thing on Floor 13 didn’t just see me…

It *knew* me.

Suddenly, the elevator took me to Floor 12, as if nothing had happened.

But my apartment door was already *open*.

And the lights inside? Already on.

I couldn’t go on like this.

I stopped sleeping. Stopped eating. Lost ten pounds in a week. My coworkers said I looked ""hollow."" I quit making excuses and started making plans.

Breaking the lease would cost me thousands. Didn’t care. I just wanted out.

I packed a bag. Grabbed the essentials. Left the rest.

It was past midnight when I headed for the lobby. The hallways were too quiet. Even the air felt tense, like the whole building was holding its breath.

I pressed the elevator call button with a shaking finger.

Ding. Doors opened.

Empty.

I stepped in.

As the doors began to close—

A hand slipped in.

The doors stopped.

A man stepped inside.

He was dressed too cleanly. Black suit, black tie, silver briefcase. No creases. No expression.

He gave me a nod. “Evening,” he said.

I nodded back, because *what else do you do*?

But something was wrong. Deeply, instinctively *wrong*.

The temperature dropped. A scent—coppery, like rust or old blood—drifted into the air.

And then I glanced at the mirrored wall.

He had no reflection.

None.

Just me. Standing alone. Even though he was two feet away.

My mouth dried up. My chest caved inward. My feet wouldn’t move.

Then he turned his head slowly toward me. Smiled. Just slightly.

“Going down?” he asked.

Not a question. Not really.

My body finally reacted. I launched myself through the doors just before they closed behind me.

They shut with a finality I felt in my spine.

I ran. Didn’t stop until I burst out into the cold, wet air of the city.

I didn’t look back.

I didn’t go home.

I didn’t even stop moving until my legs gave out three blocks away, and I collapsed on a bench, soaked in rain, heart still galloping like it was trying to escape my ribcage.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

A notification: “Nova Tower: Your elevator experience has been logged.”

I stared at the screen until the rain blurred the text. I powered the phone off. Never turned it back on again.

The next day, I checked into a cheap hotel—curtains that didn’t close right, sheets that smelled like burnt plastic—but at least there were *stairs*. Beautiful, terrible, leg-burning stairs. No elevators.

I tried sleeping. Couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that hallway. The one that shouldn’t exist. The figure at the end. Waiting.

I heard footsteps in the silence. Felt eyes in every reflection. The city noise became a background hum, and all I could focus on was *not remembering*.

Didn’t work.

A week later, while drinking stale coffee and scrolling mindlessly through news apps, I saw the headline:

NOVA TOWER RESIDENTS REPORT STRANGE GLITCHES IN ELEVATOR SYSTEM – TEMPORARY SHUTDOWN ANNOUNCED

They called it “technical issues.” Said some residents experienced “floor misplacement,” “audio distortions,” and in one vague sentence, “non-physical presences.”

But no one used the word *haunted*.

No one said, *possessed*.

No one mentioned people stepping in and not stepping out.

Buried in the comments was a post from another resident:

“Did anyone else get that creepy note about rules after 10 PM?”

Someone replied:

“Yeah. Thought it was a prank. But my dog won’t go near the elevator anymore.”

And another:

“What’s on Floor 13?”

The post was deleted less than an hour later.

I still had the note. Crumpled. Damp. Stained at the edges like it had *bled* through the paper.

I flattened it out on the desk of my hotel room, smoothing it with shaking hands. Read it again.

Every rule made sense now.

Every warning was earned.

Every line wasn’t about control—it was about survival.

Only ride to even-numbered floors. Do not speak. Do not look. Do not answer. Leave if it has no reflection.

It wasn’t a game.

It was a contract.

And I’d broken it.

That night, I had the dream again.

But this time, I wasn’t in the elevator.

I was outside Nova Tower. Looking up.

The windows glowed red—every single one. Not warm light. Not fire. *Red*. Like the building had blood instead of wiring.

And from the top floor, something *watched* me.

Not with eyes. With intent.

Like it *knew* I was still alive. Like it wasn’t finished.

I woke up with tears on my face and the taste of metal in my mouth.

I moved three times in four months. Changed phones. Changed jobs. Told no one. Cut off everyone from that part of my life.

But it wasn’t over.

It never really is, is it?

Because about a week ago, in a building I’d never been in before, I pressed the call button for the elevator.

It arrived. Empty.

I stepped in. It started rising.

Then the voice came.

Soft. Familiar.

“Good evening, Liam.”

I froze. My vision blurred.

I hadn’t told the building my name.

I looked up. The display flickered.

12… 13… 13… 13…

And I realized something.

I never left.

Not really.

If you’ve listened this far, you’ve made a mistake.

You’ve *heard* the rules.

And the thing about the rules is—they’re like bait. The moment you know they exist, the moment they live in your brain, the game begins.

You might feel it already. That chill when you step into an elevator alone. That twitch when the lights flicker. That second glance in the mirror, just to make sure it’s still *you*.

It’s watching now.

The elevator.

Not just in Nova Tower.

Anywhere.

So, listen—If you find a note in your building with strange rules on it…

Don’t laugh. Don’t test it. And whatever you do...

Don’t get in after 10 PM.

Because once you know it’s out there, once you break a rule—even once— once the elevator knows your name—it remembers you.

It never forgets.

So next time you’re alone…

Next time you press a button, and the floor you land on isn’t quite right…

Next time you hear a voice ask:

“Do you trust me?”

Don’t answer.

Just *pray* the doors open again.",4,1744862381.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

—————————-1.0 Document——————————

——————————Doctor Who——————————-

————————-Final Stand Trilogy—————————

CONCEPT LOGLINE 
Imagine being at the beginning, when the Doctor was still in the Time Lord Academy—with the Master and other Time Lords from the Doctor’s youth. This is a different take on the First Doctor in a new, mirror-like universe. Similar core events still happen—like a sequence that’s been chopped up, remixed, and told in a different order—but the story still plays through all those familiar events…

NARRATIVE 
Once upon a time, there lived a young Time Lord who had not yet chosen his title. At 95 years old and in his final years at the Academy, this young Time Lord’s life is about to change forever in an epic saga of events that will change the world and the way he sees the universe. 
He finds himself on a strange new world and must fix his ship if he’s to return home and finish his studies! This young Time Lord has no idea what is about to transpire!
This is all part of a big story yet to be written! This will be an epic, mega-evolutional battle through time—bigger than the Time War!
This is his second time landing on Earth—which is where he sorta wanted to land—but it’s 50 years later than he expected. Now he’s in the capital of South Australia: Adelaide. Upon landing, he decides to stay and focus on fixing the navigation system—or at least learn enough about this Type 40 TARDIS. He remains on Earth and never really leaves the ship.
With some knowledge under his belt, he fumbles around a bit trying to fix it and starts learning about the navigation system and the ship’s overall setup. He recalls everything from his studies about spatial engineering, dimensional space, and the heart of the ship’s energy source. Using the ship’s manual (or some sort of systems guide), he researches as much as he can and eventually turns it into his own makeshift journal-manual. He basically rewrites the guidebook for maintaining and piloting his spaceship. This becomes the holy book of the TARDIS—at once a manual, a script, blueprints, and a guide to understanding this beautiful living machine.
He uses this for his research and to compile the report for his assignment. This is his test—whenever he manages to fix the chameleon circuit, he can return home and hand this in as his assignment.
He’ll face the consequences for the incident in one of the Time Lords’ grandest museums. But he may be considered for a pardon if he succeeds in fixing the ship and proving his innocence and resilience—if the wrongs are made right. As much as his departure from Gallifrey was an accident, taking a TARDIS is forbidden for students—and stealing one carries severe punishment.
This spaceship is a relic from long ago—a museum piece, like a space shuttle in a NASA museum. In this Time Lord museum lies a trove of lore and mythology about Time Lord history: tales of Rassilon, the Other, Omega, and the time vessels built over hundreds of millennia. It is the place of knowledge for Time Lord society—the repository of history books detailing every battle, every advancement, every ruler and conquest, the noble families of Gallifrey, and even before time, before creation where demons dwell. 
Amid all these legends, this particular young Time Lord student accidentally comes across a Type 40 spacecraft time vessel. He becomes distracted during his class tour and wanders into a metallic silver cylinder, which thrusts him into the time vortex for the first time. He lands on Earth—in England, in the year 1963.
Moments after landing, the magnificent ship scans its surroundings and determines the perfect form to blend in with the environment. Within a microsecond it materializes with perfect camouflage, having taken precise readings of everything around it. It can process and analyze virtually every element of this world—taking stock of temperature, gravity, time, and even any temporal displacement. It even provides him with his exact coordinates in space and time, along with the current oxygen levels and an awareness of nearby life forms.
This young Gallifreyan finds himself on planet Earth, among the human species. He is cautious and stays within his ship, just as his teacher told him to. He studies humans through a lens, you could say—learning about their history and the history of their planet. 
He discovers the illusion of moving pictures and starts watching classic and modern cinema, as well as TV shows. This Doctor becomes a film buff, eagerly viewing historical documentaries and fictional films alike. He longs for human connection and falls in love with humanity. And slowly, over time, he ventures out of his blue box—his spaceship—and discovers Earth through firsthand experience.
This young man appears to be about 25 in human years—but he isn’t actually 25 years old. He is, in fact, in his late nineties. He is wiser than the average 25-year-old Human but still has the youthfulness of an 18–20-year-old. (We are talking about Time Lord natural lifespan here.) A 100-year-old Time Lord would be considered a young adult—roughly like 25 in human years—even though Time Lords could live for 1,300 years, if each incarnation only lived about 100 years. 
So it depends on the Time Lord’s lifestyle and lifespan. They could live for 500 Earth years and appear very old, yet still be in their first incarnation! So 500 x 13 incarnations—you get the point. A Time Lord can live a very long lifetime! And this is why this Time Lord is like a child or a young teenager compared to other Time Lords.

The Love Story of the Doctor’s First Love and First Companion
It was a Autum morning in Adelaide, with fog drifting through the city and late showers expected in the evening. Weather in Adelaide is predictably unpredictable, and a young woman is trying to get someone to come in and cover the evening shift. 
She has class in the morning, teaches some lessons in the afternoon, and then has to go to a life-changing interview for the Australian Space Engineering Program after her 9am class that finishes at 2 p.m. 
Now she needs someone to cover the last shift and close up for the night. But her manager and store manager are on their honeymoon together, leaving her to manage the small amount of casuals and limited staff—fully knowing she booked in months in advance for this NASA-joint Royal Australian Air Force recruiting stage, which is looking for bright minds of the future. And wanted only a 2 days off work, 
The boss and her partner have been running this cute little café in the space museum for 10 years now and are on their honeymooning  in New Zealand for 3 months. They had their wedding and honeymoon in New Zealand because of their family.
Poor Elisabeth is stuck with all these things on her plate. She’s 20, turning 21 in 2 weeks!! And with the most important moment of her life about to slip through her fingers, she comes up with a game plan to do both: work at 3 and be in the online meeting for the most important opportunity of her life, which starts at 3:30 and goes for 2 hours with a half-hour break in between. She has to present her work and provide evidence of her being a perfect candidate for this new role—a government scheme to find bright minds for the military and government positions.
She starts pulling it off—until she gets an influx of customers and huge orders of coffee and sandwiches. She tries to juggle the meeting, unmuting the call to speak and muting it again while cooking and making coffees for a family and groups of uni students going to their night classes. She tries her best to multi-task, and she does it well—but with great effort.
A few of the head project recruiters noticed, then asked if everything is okay, if she’s running or distracted, because questions have to constantly be repeated. She tries her best to reassure them everything is fine, as she barely has a grip now. 
Tired and puffed out, sweat dripping from her brow, she finally gets a moment to rest and respond normally, now that the night rush is over and there’s an hour left of her shift. She completes the video call, not knowing if she did enough to get a spot!! Sad and relieved to breathe, she sees a man out of the corner of her eye—a boy from her class—come in. He doesn’t order a coffee but is running around the museum like a madman with some sort of makeshift DIY gadget and sneaks through a locked maintenance cupboard.
Elisabeth Carter is curious—but mainly pissed off for some reason. It’s as if the built-up stress and pressure finally broke, and she storms in,
 At that exact moment the door opens. She sees a mirror-like crack in the back wall of the maintenance closet, and then she sees the man running back and forth like a Scooby-Doo montage, with a weird alien chasing him. 
Then the man sees her. The moment he recognizes someone is there, he says, 
“Hello, sweetie. You better get out of here. I’ve got this handled—whatever this is. But look, you have to go.”
The Doctor is then knocked out by the intelligent alien and is now held captive, along with his newly acquainted friend.
It’s a time rip—or time fissure, the Doctor learns—and a desperate alien is trying to use the rip to fix their own problem. The energy from the explosion of the Earth would cascade across the cosmos, surfing a cosmic wave, shielded by their board and energy field, and return to their time. But in doing so, it wouldn’t just destroy the planet—it would rip a hole in space-time, like a black hole. But it isn’t an ordinary black hole—it doesn’t just pull in space and light, it pulls in time, and would suck in all of reality, imploding it.
The young man comes to!!
Elisabeth Carter is in shock but does not scream like a damsel in distress. She notices him awake, tied up by some sort of energy field. The alien runs around repairing his space board. 
The man subtly winks at her and plays dead. Suddenly the alien then comes up to her, sniffing her fear like a scent. And within a flash.
The creature turns their attention to the man, who now is within their grasp, The Future-Alien has their hand wrapped tight around his throat.
But doesn’t see him now holding his transmitter, telo pack, and space board—and in a flash of a moment, light from the teleporter goes off, safely teleporting the young Time Lord and the younger earth girl back to his ship, materialised in the console room.
To her shock and amazement at being alive and somewhere else, she freaks out and laughs for a few moments. She snorts, and then slaps the young man!! Then, demanding to be told what’s going on—and where the hell she is, and who he is?
This is where he gets the nickname “Who.”
The young man tries to explain he doesn’t have a name and that he’s in fact an alien too—that he’s from a race called the Time Lords, from a galaxy far, far away in a Star constellation called Kasterborous, on the planet Gallifrey.
She is stunned by what she’s hearing and has seen. She than again asked him who he is and what he’s going to do about the other alien!!
The young Time Lord looks at her with a smile and a warm face and says to her:
“Hi”
“I’m an illegal alien….
“My name is yet to be decided, but I have a few ideas. Here… did you want me to spitball some ideas out to ya, and you can tell me what you think?”
Before he can finish, she interrupts him and says:
“Look, I don’t know who you are or what you are. I’m tired, and I’m sore, and I wanna go home!!! What the hell are you going to do about the other illegal alien… than? It threatened the whole planet!?” 
“Didn’t it.?”
The young man replies with a little hint of ego:
“Oh him? Oh, he’s dealt with. He’s fine. He’s harmless—couldn’t hurt a fly. Well… not now he won’t.”
“What—?”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, let’s just say he’s okay… but he’s gonna feel like a bit of a fool with his pants around his ankles.”
“Huh… what the hell are you saying or failing miserably to quote? Look, take me home if he’s dealt with! I don’t know where I am or who you still are!!”
“Besides you being—”
At the same time, they both say:
“Being an illegal alien.”
“Yeah, right—from like what… outer space?”
“Yeah.”
“Ahh, right!!”
 “So not from Mexico…” she adds with a light giggle in response.
The young man smiles at the humor and silly human societal commentary.
“Look… this is my ship. My spaceship. And I can take you home…”
“but… well… you might have to pay for a cab fee or something!”
Elisabeth Carter is shocked at how casually he said that—and that he seemed like he meant it. She ponders for a brief moment as she gathers her thoughts and questions, and he than walks over to the door. Her gaze follows in confusion. The door thrusts open, revealing them to be in her school parking lot—a five-minute walk away from where they just were at the space museum!!
In all her shock, Elisabeth, taking it all in, glances out of the spaceship and recognizes the area around her university.
“We’re still on Earth? And that’s—my university!”
The Doctor nods. “Thought a familiar spot might make this a bit easier to process.”
She then walks outside onto the uni car park. Elisabeth looks back at the young mysterious man and sees a blue box standing right behind him.
“Ooooh, that old thing?…”
“Well…” he says, while scratching his head and then rubbing his hand across his face. He continues:
“Yeah, it’s been stuck like this since 1963.”
“Adds a bit of vintage charm, don’t you think?”
While Elisabeth just stands there, trying to process it all.
He then says:
“I’ve been meaning to fix it, but it’s grown on me. Once I do, I can finally head back home.”
All delivered with that laid-back charm, leaving Elisabeth to marvel at the sheer casualness of it all.
After their chat, Elisabeth pulls out her phone, texts her mum, and then calls a cab.
The Time Lord recognises what she’s doing and offers his hand in a gesture.
“Need some help? I promise…” 
“I won’t steal your phone.”
The young man then pulls out a device—his rudimentary sonic screwdriver. He scans her mobile phone for just a moment… then hands it back with a satisfied smile.
“There you go! All set now! The cab’s covered.”
And with a playful wink, he adds:
“Until next time, Elisabeth.”
“Hey, You know where to find me.”
Then, with a swish of his coat, he steps back towards his spaceship. He turns back to Elisabeth:
“Well, looks like I’ll be around. If you ever fancy a chat… or an adventure.”
Then he heads inside, leaving her with a sense of wonder and the promise of future encounters.

She realises she needs to stop, and still has to close up. Luckily she canceled the ride and then rebooked it. The museum cafė was quiet and no customers were there! She was glad that this was the case, her uber driver notified telling her ride had arrived. With a text message. 

This is where the young Gallifreyan Time Lord is able to properly communicate and interact with a person. Humans look a lot like Time Lords, and so he finds comfort in her presence! But he’s locked on and focused. He needs to fix the navigation system properly and continue fixing the chameleon circuit so he can go home. But it doesn’t make it any easier now that he’s met Elisabeth Carter.

# Foods to Avoid While Taking Letrozole: 2025 Fertility Guide

Letrozole is a medication primarily used in the treatment of breast cancer, but it's also commonly prescribed off-label to stimulate ovulation in women experiencing infertility. While taking letrozole, it's crucial to be mindful of dietary choices, as certain foods and beverages can potentially interfere with the medication's effectiveness or exacerbate side effects. This guide provides essential information about foods to avoid or limit while undergoing letrozole treatment for fertility, helping you optimize your chances of conception and minimize discomfort.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The impact of diet on letrozole's efficacy often stems from how different foods affect hormone levels, liver function, and overall inflammation within the body. Understanding these interactions can empower individuals to make informed dietary decisions during their fertility journey.

**Phytoestrogen-Rich Foods:** These plant-based compounds mimic estrogen in the body and can potentially counteract the estrogen-lowering effects of letrozole, which is prescribed to stimulate follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and promote ovulation.

Phytoestrogens are naturally occurring compounds found in various plants that bear a structural similarity to estrogen. These compounds can bind to estrogen receptors in the body, potentially exerting either estrogenic or anti-estrogenic effects. Foods high in phytoestrogens include soy products (tofu, tempeh, edamame, soy milk), flaxseeds, sesame seeds, and certain beans. While these foods are generally considered healthy, consuming them in large quantities during letrozole treatment may interfere with the drug's intended mechanism of action. It's best to consult with a healthcare provider about safe consumption levels.

**Processed Foods and Sugary Drinks:** High levels of processed foods and sugary drinks can cause inflammation and blood sugar imbalances, potentially impacting hormonal regulation and overall fertility.

Processed foods often contain high amounts of refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and artificial additives. These ingredients can contribute to inflammation throughout the body, which can negatively affect hormonal balance and ovarian function. Sugary drinks, such as soda and fruit juices, can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, leading to insulin resistance and potentially disrupting ovulation. Limiting or avoiding these foods and beverages can help maintain a stable hormonal environment conducive to fertility.

**Alcohol:** Alcohol can affect liver function, potentially interfering with the metabolism of letrozole and impacting its effectiveness.

The liver plays a vital role in metabolizing medications, including letrozole. Alcohol consumption can place additional stress on the liver, potentially impairing its ability to process letrozole efficiently. This can lead to altered drug levels in the body, potentially reducing its effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects. It's generally recommended to avoid or significantly limit alcohol intake while taking letrozole.

**Excessive Caffeine:** High caffeine intake can exacerbate anxiety and sleep disturbances, which are already potential side effects of letrozole.

Caffeine is a stimulant that can affect the central nervous system, potentially increasing anxiety, restlessness, and sleep disturbances. Letrozole can sometimes cause similar side effects, so excessive caffeine consumption may worsen these symptoms. Furthermore, high caffeine intake has been linked to potential negative effects on fertility in some studies. Limiting caffeine intake from coffee, tea, energy drinks, and chocolate can help minimize these risks and promote better overall well-being during letrozole treatment.

**Trans Fats:** These unhealthy fats can negatively impact insulin sensitivity and overall hormone production.

Trans fats are primarily found in processed foods, such as fried foods, baked goods, and margarine. These fats have been linked to various health problems, including insulin resistance and inflammation. Insulin resistance can disrupt ovulation and negatively impact fertility. Avoiding foods high in trans fats can help improve insulin sensitivity and support healthy hormone production.

 ## Core Benefits

Adhering to a fertility-friendly diet while taking letrozole can significantly enhance the chances of successful ovulation and conception.

**Improved Medication Effectiveness:** By avoiding foods that interfere with letrozole's mechanism of action, you can maximize its ability to stimulate ovulation and increase the likelihood of pregnancy.

Following the dietary guidelines outlined in this guide helps ensure that letrozole can effectively lower estrogen levels and stimulate the release of FSH, ultimately promoting follicle development and ovulation. This can lead to a higher chance of successful conception.

**Reduced Side Effects:** Limiting foods that exacerbate letrozole's potential side effects, such as anxiety and sleep disturbances, can improve your overall well-being during treatment.

By minimizing caffeine intake and prioritizing a balanced diet, you can help mitigate potential side effects like anxiety, insomnia, and headaches, making the letrozole treatment process more comfortable and manageable.

**Enhanced Overall Fertility:** A healthy diet rich in essential nutrients supports optimal hormone production, ovarian function, and overall reproductive health.

Focusing on whole, unprocessed foods, lean protein, and healthy fats can provide the body with the necessary nutrients to support healthy hormone production, improve egg quality, and enhance overall fertility. This can increase the chances of successful conception, both naturally and with the assistance of letrozole.

**Increased Chances of a Healthy Pregnancy:** A well-nourished body is better prepared for pregnancy, increasing the likelihood of a healthy outcome for both mother and child.

Prioritizing a healthy diet before and during pregnancy can provide the developing fetus with the essential nutrients it needs for optimal growth and development. This can reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and improve the chances of a healthy pregnancy outcome.

 ## FAQs Section

**Can I eat soy sauce while taking letrozole?**
    Yes, soy sauce is generally considered safe in moderation. However, since it's a soy product, excessive consumption should be avoided to minimize potential phytoestrogen effects.

**Are there any specific fruits or vegetables I should avoid?**
    No, there are no specific fruits or vegetables that need to be completely avoided. However, it's best to consume a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables as part of a balanced diet.

**Can I drink herbal tea while on letrozole?**
    Some herbal teas may contain phytoestrogens. It's best to consult with your healthcare provider before consuming herbal teas while taking letrozole to ensure they don't interfere with the medication's effectiveness.

**How long after taking letrozole should I follow these dietary guidelines?**
    It's recommended to follow these dietary guidelines throughout your letrozole treatment cycle and potentially continue them during early pregnancy, as a healthy diet is beneficial for both mother and baby. Consult with your healthcare provider for personalized recommendations.

1k13r8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colognes/comments/1k13r8r/beginner_questions_after_trying_a_bunch_of_samples/,Beginner - Questions after trying a bunch of samples.,"I went on Parfumo at the suggestion of someone on the subreddit and tried some bottles from most of the different scent categories. After smelling them all the samples, there were a few categories that I really liked, but was wondering if there might be better examples of those categories than what I tried. Not that I wouldn't buy the ones I tried, but just wondering if there is anything I should try similar before I pull the trigger on something.

* Tom Ford Beau de Jour - I liked this a lot, but it also smelled like a lot of other barbershop type scents I've smelled in the past (not in a bad way though). Any other fougere scents that anyone would recommend? 
* Hermes Terre d'Hermes Pure - Anything else that has this citrus/woody note? Also really liked this one. 
* Rogue Chypre-Siam - I liked this, but it also smelled a bit like an old man. Maybe I just like that though and should just except the fact that I'm in my late 40's. Any other chypre's I should look at? 
* LV Imagination/Meteore - I tried the like meteore at an LV and liked it. Sprayed some on my arm and it lasted all day. I could still smell it the next day even if I got close. I ordered a sample of Imagination and I think I like it a bit more, but it doesn't seem to last on me at all. Not sure if that's because my sample was one of the little dip bottles vs a spray. But looking for something fresh smelling and interesting like Imagination that might last a bit longer (doesn't have to smell exactly like Imagination, but something clean, fresh and unique/different). 

Here are the others I got and some notes on a few of them. 

* Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb Extreme- I may get a bottle of this. Smelled like the holidays to me.
* Xerjoff Naxos - This was probably my favorite of everything. I will 100% buy a bottle of this. But I live in Phoenix and it's almost summer, so I'll probably wait a few months to grab that bottle. This might not be a very 120 degree summer scent.
* Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio Parfum - This smelled like the boy's locker room in high school to me. Was not my favorite. May need to find a more unique aqua scent to try. 
* Montale Chocolate Greedy - This was so photorealistic chocolate to me. I don't think I'd wear it, but it was a lovely scent. Maybe if I went to a baking class or something. 
* Maison Margiela REPLICA By The Fireplace - Not into the smokey smell I don't think. 
* Tom Ford Ombre Leather - Like the smokey scent, I don't think I'm into leather scents very much.
* Xerjoff Oud Stars Alexandria II - I've liked oud scents that I've smelled in the past and this one I liked a ton. May end up getting this one.
* Lalique Encre Noire - Didn't love it. 
* Dior Homme 2020 - It didn't smell bad, but just felt really one dimensional. Sort of boring I guess. 
* Diptyque Olene - Leaned too much towards a grandma scent to me. 
* Profumum Roma Patchouly - Much like Acqua Di Dio, anything with a heavy patchouli scent smells like high school to me in a bad way. Instead of a locker room, this smelled like every pothead's bedroom. 
* Theodoros Kalotinis Coffee Addict - This triggered an insane scent memory for me. It smelled exactly like the Cafe Vienna instant coffee my grandmother would drink in the 1980's. It's all I could think of. I don't think I'd wear it, but I enjoyed the memory.
* La Labo - Another 13 - Smelled super plasticky, but in a nice way. 
* Moschino Toy Boy - I have really liked rose scents in the past. But this had such a strong a plasticky (in a bad way) smell and the rose scent smelled very synthetic to me. My whole room has smelled like this for the past 48 hours after putting a single spritz on a piece of paper. I think I may have Stockholm Syndrome though, because after those 48 hours, I'm kind of loving it and I'm fairly certain I'm going to buy a bottle. 

Anyone have any other suggestions? Especially for something that would work well in the summer, as some of the ones I liked the most seem like they may be too heavy for AZ summers.

## What is Immediate Evex Pro?

**Immediate Evex Pro** is an automated trading platform designed for users who want to trade assets like **cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks**, and **commodities**. It uses a smart algorithm that scans the market in real-time, looking for trading opportunities based on market data, trends, and historical patterns.

The platform operates with the goal of making trading more accessible—even if you have zero prior experience. It’s web-based, so no downloads needed, and it claims to work 24/7 to help users make smarter, faster trades with minimal manual input. Think of it like having a digital assistant that never sleeps—constantly analyzing data for you.

## Who Created Immediate Evex Pro?

This is where things get a little fuzzy. Like many automated trading platforms in this space, **Immediate Evex Pro doesn’t have a well-known public founder or development team**. That’s not uncommon though—platforms like Bitcoin Code, Immediate Edge, and others often keep their creators anonymous for privacy or business reasons.

While this might raise an eyebrow for some, it’s worth noting that the platform appears to be backed by a network of brokers and has ongoing support, partnerships, and updates. That said, **transparency could definitely be improved**, and I’d personally love to see more info about the team behind it.

## How Does Immediate Evex Pro Work?

At its core, **Immediate Evex Pro uses algorithms and AI** to automate trading decisions. It scans global markets in real-time and executes trades based on pre-set parameters or market signals. Here’s how it works step-by-step:

- The algorithm starts analyzing the market and pinpoints profitable trades.
- Based on your settings, it either executes trades automatically or notifies you to approve them.

## What is Super Trader App?

Super Trader App is an **automated trading platform** that uses AI-based algorithms to help users trade cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and other financial assets. It’s designed to work for both beginners who have zero trading experience and more advanced users who want to automate part of their strategy.

The app aims to analyze market trends and execute trades automatically when certain conditions are met. You can customize the risk level, set stop-losses, and even go full manual if you prefer. It takes a lot of the stress out of trading by handling the heavy lifting—kind of like having a robo-assistant who actually knows what they’re doing.

## Who Created Super Trader App?

One thing I liked is that **Super Trader App isn’t hiding behind a curtain**. While the exact team isn’t public like Elon Musk-level transparent, it’s reportedly developed by a group of **financial analysts, software engineers, and AI specialists** who have experience building other trading bots like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**.

From what I’ve seen in interviews and press releases, the creators wanted to build a platform that was **accessible, flexible, and actually useful**. Not just another cash grab with a flashy landing page. And based on the UI and performance, you can tell there’s real thought behind it.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Super Trader App Today](https://tinyurl.com/yc47yajp)
## How Does Super Trader App Work?

Okay, so here’s the cool part. Super Trader App connects you to **licensed brokers** and uses an AI algorithm to scan the markets in real-time. It looks for profitable trades based on technical indicators, news sentiment, and historical data. When it spots a golden opportunity, it can either alert you or automatically enter the trade depending on your settings.

You can customize:
- **Trade size**
- **Risk level**
- **Stop-loss and take-profit ratios**
- **Which assets to focus on**

It’s got a **demo mode**, which I strongly recommend using first. This lets you test the waters without risking actual cash. Once you're comfortable, switch to live mode and start trading with real money.

## Super Trader App Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real—no app is perfect. But here's what stood out:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Beginner-friendly interface
- ✅ AI-driven trading with solid accuracy
- ✅ Supports crypto, forex, stocks, and more
- ✅ No hidden fees or commissions
- ✅ Fast withdrawals (1–2 days)
- ✅ Demo account available
- ✅ Works on all devices

**Cons:**
- ❌ Minimum deposit of $250 (could be lower for casuals)
- ❌ No mobile app in the app store (web-based only)

### [👉 Open Your Super Trader App Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/yc47yajp)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access Super Trader App?

Super Trader App is **fully web-based**, which means you don’t need to download anything. You can access it from:

- **PCs and Laptops** (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android via browser)
- **Tablets**

It’s mobile-optimized, so the interface adjusts to your screen size. I’ve used it on my iPhone and it runs just fine. That said, a **dedicated app would be nice**, especially for push notifications and better performance on the go.

## Super Trader App – Supported Countries

Super Trader App is available in **over 130 countries**, including:

- United States
- United Kingdom
- Canada
- Australia
- Germany
- South Africa
- Brazil

However, it's **not available in some restricted regions** due to local regulations. If you try to sign up and get a “not available in your country” message, that’s why. Use a VPN at your own risk—but I’m not saying you should or shouldn’t. 😉

## Super Trader App – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This feature is the real MVP. The app uses **advanced algorithms** to scan the market 24/7, analyzing price movements, volume, and even social media sentiment to find profitable trades. It’s like having a Wall Street analyst living in your phone.

### User-Friendly Interface

What I love here is the **zero friction**. Everything is clean, uncluttered, and easy to find. No jargon, no weird buttons. Whether you’re 18 or 68, you can figure this out in under 10 minutes.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even though there’s no native app, the **mobile web version** is smooth. You can monitor trades, tweak settings, and withdraw profits from your phone while you wait in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

Set custom notifications for price movements, trade executions, or market changes. These alerts give you more control without needing to babysit your trades all day.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not limited to crypto here. The app supports:
- **Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins**
- **Forex pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, etc.)**
- **Stocks and indices**
- **Commodities like gold and oil**

This makes it a great all-in-one platform if you like to spread your investments.

## Is Super Trader App a Scam?

Short answer: **No, it’s not a scam**.

I get the skepticism. There are a ton of shady apps out there making wild promises. But Super Trader App actually **delivers on its features**. It connects you to **regulated brokers**, uses SSL encryption, and doesn’t try to upsell you every five minutes.

Do your own due diligence, of course. But from my experience and others I’ve seen online, it’s **legit and safe to use**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Super Trader App?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this. It's not pocket change, but it's a manageable entry point for most people who are serious about trying automated trading.

You can deposit using:
- Credit/debit cards
- Bank transfer
- E-wallets (depending on your region)

### Super Trader App Customer Support

Customer support is surprisingly decent. They offer:
- **24/7 live chat**
- **Email support**
- **Phone support** (via broker)

I tested the live chat twice and got a response in under 2 minutes both times. Pretty solid compared to other platforms that ghost you for hours.

## How do you start trading on Super Trader App?

Getting started is painless and fast. Here’s the 3-step process:

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Super Trader App site and fill out the registration form. It only asks for basic info (name, email, phone). No credit card needed to sign up.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you’ll be connected with a **partnered broker**. You’ll need to verify your identity (KYC) by uploading a valid ID and address proof. Then, deposit the **$250 minimum** to activate your account.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either use the **demo mode** to practice or jump into live trading. Adjust your risk settings and let the AI do its thing. Or manually execute trades if you prefer the hands-on approach.

## How to Delete a Super Trader App Account?

If you ever want to peace out, just contact customer support and request account deletion. They’ll usually process it within 24–48 hours. Make sure you withdraw any remaining funds first.

But I haven’t eaten in like two days and I’ve been rotating between staring at the ceiling and scrolling his Spotify activity like I’m some kind of detective.

We were together a year and a half. It wasn’t perfect but it was mine. You know what I mean? Like it was my stupid little imperfect relationship with my stupid little man who couldn’t even close a cabinet all the way but knew how I liked my coffee and memorized the stretch of road where I always got anxious. And now he’s just…gone? And it’s supposed to be fine?

We had a dumb fight on Tuesday night. Like not even one of the big ones. He said I was being ""too reactive"" because I got upset that he forgot to tell me he made plans with his friends on a night we were supposed to hang out. I said, “that hurts my feelings,” and he said, “why does everything have to be about your feelings?”

That was it. That’s what broke me.

We didn’t talk for a couple days. Then yesterday, he texts me: “Maybe we want different things.” That was it. No call. No actual conversation. Just vibes and devastation.

So now I’m crying in shifts. I cry while brushing my teeth. I cry while trying to fold laundry. I cried because his toothbrush is still in my drawer and I don’t know whether to throw it out or keep it in case he changes his mind (???? girl, be serious). I even cried because the Uber driver played a song he once sent me and I had to sit there like “mmhmm thank you sir” while emotionally combusting.

Also can we talk about the sick irony of how he’s posting memes on IG about “protecting your peace” while I’m out here Googling “how to stop loving someone who doesn’t love you back” like I’m in a fucking Taylor Swift lyric?

I KNOW I’m supposed to feel empowered. I KNOW he’s not my soulmate if he couldn’t even say goodbye properly. I KNOW I should delete his contact and block him and do hot girl shit but right now I’m just a very sad girl in an oversized hoodie eating a sleeve of Oreos for dinner.

Overall, I’m super happy with it,  it’s lightweight, and I love having Touch ID built right into the keyboard. However, when I use it on my desk, it slides around really easily. Is there anything I can do to prevent it from sliding around except for using a mouse pad? Because I also plan to use this keyboard outside in coffee shops, etc ",1,1744861421.0,mac,1,1.0,False

# What Is “Crush Micro Stakes Online Poker - Alton Hardin”?

“Crush Micro Stakes Online Poker - Alton Hardin” is basically *the* go-to online course if you’re looking to dominate the micro stakes poker tables. It’s like the ultimate roadmap for turning your spare time and a few bucks into a legit poker bankroll. Whether you’re sitting at $2, $5, or $10 tables, Alton walks you through exactly how to build skills, boost confidence, and start raking in those small-but-add-up wins. Think of it as poker school... but way more fun and profitable.

# Who Should Take This Course?

This one’s for all the dreamers and grinders. New to online poker? You’re in. Been playing for a while but keep breaking even (or losing)? You’re in too. Honestly, *anyone* who wants to become a winning player in micro stakes games will get serious value from this. You just need a basic understanding of No Limit Hold’em and a desire to stop donating money to the table.

# When Should You Dive Into It?

Short answer? Right now. Especially if you’re tired of spinning your wheels in low-stakes games and ready to level up. The beauty of micro stakes poker is that the risk is low, but with the right strategy, the rewards stack up — quickly. And the sooner you understand how to beat these games, the faster you can move up and grow your bankroll.

# Where Does All the Magic Happen?

All online, baby. That’s the beauty of it. You can take the course at your own pace, on your own time, from wherever you play — whether that’s your couch, a coffee shop, or your secret poker cave. And the course includes *tons* of live play sessions, hand history reviews, and examples so you can see strategy in real action. It’s not just theory — it’s real, nitty-gritty poker.

# Why Is This Course a Big Deal?

Because micro stakes is where 90% of players start — and where most of them get stuck. But Alton’s course flips the script. He’s made over $1,000 in his spare time just from low-buy-in games. This course shows you exactly how, with an approach that’s tight-aggressive, super strategic, and designed for long-term success. He even dives into poker math (but in a way that won’t make your head explode), pre-flop and post-flop strategy, continuation betting, bluffing, using HUD stats… and more.

# How Will This Course Help You Win?

Simple: it gives you a system. A clear, repeatable, tested process to beat micro stakes online poker. You’ll learn which hands to play, how to exploit different player types, when to bluff, when to back off, and how to maximize your winnings on the turn and river. It’s everything you *wish* you knew when you first started playing.

# Final Thoughts

“**Crush Micro Stakes Online Poker - Alton Hardin**” isn’t just another poker course — it’s a full-on masterclass for the everyday player who wants to win more consistently. If you’ve ever dreamed of making real money playing poker (without risking your rent money), this is a killer place to start. The guidance is clear, the strategy is solid, and the wins?

1k13jws,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k13jws/i_realized_my_attachment_style_cost_me_the_woman/,I realized my attachment style cost me the woman I love,"Today, after 7 months of separation and 5 months without contact, I wrote to her. I felt I had to do it—it’s been exactly one year since she gave me a ring as a gesture of love. I did gave her a ring too, but I destroyed the relationship, even though I didn’t mean to. I’ve realized that I have a fearful-avoidant attachment style, and that gesture was the beginning of the end. She did breakup with me, but I pushed her to do it with how I was.

Changing is so damn hard. I’m tired—exhausted. I’ve given everything over the past 6 months. I’ve lost 50 pounds Working out, I’ve seen two different psychologists every week. I really wanted to get better. But with her response, I know and I see clearly now that she doesn’t love me anymore. And that… that’s so heavy to carry.

I can’t seem to find the motivation to keep making all these efforts just for myself, even though I know deep down that it’s the path I need to take…

It’s so frustrating to hurt someone you love—without meaning to. I so wish I didn’t have these struggles. I so wish I were different. And more than anything, I’m afraid that I’ll never change enough to become a good partner in a relationship.

Without this ring, I feel so lost, empty, and without purpose...


Here's the message I sent to her:

""Hi Stéphanie,

Exactly one year ago, you gave me this ring. That gift meant so much more to me than just an object: it represented something I had long wished for… That a woman like you could love me, see me, choose me enough to make such a meaningful gesture. And yet, with hindsight, I see that it also marked the beginning of the end.

I wasn’t able to handle that much love, that much commitment, because deep down, I didn’t believe I was worthy of receiving it. I’ve realized that I carry within me a deep inner struggle, a broken relationship with myself. I know now that unless I learn to love myself, respect myself, and take care of my wounds, I’ll keep hurting and projecting my pain onto the people around me—without meaning to.

I’m deeply sorry for the pain I caused you. It took me time to fully grasp the impact of some of my behaviors and reactions. It’s not what I wanted, but I know the harm was real. And it breaks me to think that someone like you, so kind and generous, had to go through that because of me. I can’t erase what happened, but I can learn. And that’s what I’ve chosen to do.

I promised you I wouldn’t give up. That I’d do everything I could to work on myself. I kept that promise. Not just for you, but because I eventually understood I owed it to myself too. Since then, I haven’t missed a single session with Étienne and Emmanuelle. I dove into my attachment issues, I accepted to look at my patterns, my avoidances, my reactions. It wasn’t perfect—far from it. I wanted to give up more than once, but I chose to persevere. The journey is far from over, but I’ve made progress. And today, I can take off this ring, with the conviction that I did everything I could to improve. For me. For you. For what the relationship meant to me—I owed it to all of that.

I want to thank you. From the bottom of my heart. Thank you for your love, your generosity, your patience, your gentleness. Thank you for the way you saw and loved me even when I couldn’t love myself. Thank you for your efforts, for the times you came back, for your light. You taught me priceless lessons.

I know I often told you I didn’t believe in soulmates or “the one,” but you were a gift in my life. I often think about us. About those moments when we were on the couch, talking, laughing, looking into each other’s eyes. Everything felt simple. Genuine. There was something unique between us. I don’t think that kind of connection happens often. What we had was rare, precious.

You are and remain the most beautiful human I’ve ever met, with an enormous heart. And even if the ending isn’t what I would have wanted, you helped me in so many ways. Thanks to you, I’m a better man. For all of that, I am filled with gratitude.

I hope you’re doing well. That you find the peace, balance, and softness you deserve. I hope you feel fulfilled and happy. And if ever one day you feel open to having a coffee, I’d be happy to see you again.

You’ll always be a precious person to me.
Thank you for everything. Take care of yourself.

Wishing you the best on your journey.""


She did answer:

""Thank you, Dom, I'm deeply moved and touched by your message. I found myself crying as I read it...

Thank you for taking the time to write this message to me. I'm truly proud of you and of the journey you've made.

I hope that removing the ring will help you move forward in the direction you want and free yourself from our relationship.

As for me, I'm happy and enjoying my time alone to recharge. I won’t lie, I’ve also had work to do on myself, and I’m not short on therapy sessions either, hihihi. Know that despite all the negative things we went through, I don't hold it against us. I'm not fully healed yet either, but I keep moving forward.

I’m trying to find some balance, but it’s not easy. Today I officially started a new job. I'm proud of myself for leaving Solertia. It wasn’t easy. My health wasn’t great—high blood pressure, extreme fatigue, low potassium levels, migraines... Everything got better once everyone was informed. Fortunately.

All in all, I’m doing well, but no one’s life is perfect.

I don’t think meeting for coffee is a good idea yet...

Have a great week, and thank you again so much!""",1,1744861310.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1k13hpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1k13hpl/mx_keys_s_random_disconnects_and_key_input_delays/,MX Keys S: Random Disconnects and Key Input Delays.,"My MX Keys S keyboard had been acting weird since I got it. Every so often, the green LED would turn on, and there would be a delay of a few seconds before it registered keystrokes, even if I had already been typing. 

This has been a nightmare, especially since I’m a web and graphic designer and occasionally game with this keyboard. Not exactly ideal when your keys decide to take a coffee break mid-battle.  
  
It's connected via Bolt. I tried several things, and it seems like it might finally be fixed. I uninstalled all the software and reinstalled it (Options+), reset the keyboard using (Esc + O, Esc + O, Esc + B), and paired it using the Easy-Switch option 3, battery saving mode off, manual brightness. It’s now the second day without any issues.

Hope this saves another soul from this annoying purgatory.",1,1744861111.0,logitech,0,1.0,False

You have two main options: **manual trading** or **automated trading**. If you’re a control freak (no judgment), you can input your own parameters. If you’re more hands-off, just activate the auto mode and let the system do its thing.

It also features **demo trading**, which is super useful for testing strategies without risking real money. The platform connects to brokers, executing trades on your behalf through them, which is how most of these systems operate.

## Is CalarixTrader a Scam?

From what I’ve seen and tested, **CalarixTrader is not a scam**. It works pretty much as advertised. It connects with regulated brokers, offers transparent settings, and lets you withdraw your funds.

That said, **always be cautious**. Never invest money you can’t afford to lose, and definitely use the demo account before going live.

The minimum deposit is **$250**. This is pretty standard for platforms in this space. It’s not free money—this is your initial trading capital.

Developing certain skills can significantly improve your prospects when applying for remote part-time jobs. These include:

- **Strong Communication:** Clear writing and verbal communication are crucial when collaborating remotely.
- **Time Management:** Ability to prioritize tasks efficiently and meet deadlines without direct supervision.
- **Technological Proficiency:** Familiarity with tools like Microsoft Office, project management platforms (Asana, Trello), and communication apps (Zoom, Slack).
- **Self-Motivation:** Working independently requires a proactive mindset and accountability.
 
By investing in these skills, you not only qualify for more remote listings but also increase your chances of thriving in a virtual work environment.

### Taking the First Step

Beginning your remote online job journey might feel overwhelming at first, but starting small is perfectly fine. Consider picking up freelance projects or micro-tasks to build experience and confidence. With time, you can expand into higher-paying roles or even create a mixed portfolio of remote income streams. Always keep an eye on industry trends and emerging job opportunities, as the remote work landscape evolves rapidly.

Whether you seek extra income to meet financial goals or want to enjoy the flexibility only remote work can offer, part-time online jobs represent a practical pathway. With dedication and the right approach, you can tap into this lucrative space and transform your spare time into valuable earnings.

</div>Essential Tips to Succeed in Part-Time Remote Work and Balance Your Schedule
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Finding remote online jobs for individuals seeking part-time income is an opportunity that many welcome for the flexibility and extra earnings it offers. However, succeeding in this type of work and maintaining a healthy balance between your personal life and job can be challenging without the proper approach. Whether you’re new to part-time remote work or looking to enhance your current routine, these tips can guide you toward success and better time management.

### Set a Clear Work Schedule and Stick to It

One of the biggest advantages—and potential pitfalls—of remote online jobs for individuals seeking part-time income is the freedom to set your own hours. To prevent work from creeping into your personal time, establish specific working hours that fit your lifestyle. Communicate these hours clearly with your employers or clients. Consistency makes it easier to manage your tasks and lets you relax when it’s time to switch off.

### Create a Dedicated Workspace

Having a designated area for work helps build focus and productivity. Choose a quiet spot with minimal distractions—this signals to your brain that it’s time to work. Your workspace should be comfortable and have all necessary tools like a computer, good internet connection, and any other job-specific equipment. Even if your remote position is part-time, crafting an ergonomic and distraction-free area is key to delivering your best performance.

### Prioritize Tasks Efficiently

When juggling multiple responsibilities or clients, task prioritization becomes essential. Utilize tools like to-do lists or digital planners to map out your tasks each day. Break larger projects into small, manageable steps. This method helps you maintain progress and prevents feeling overwhelmed. Focus on high-impact tasks first to make the most of your limited working hours.

### Communicate Proactively with Employers and Clients

Remote work relies heavily on clear communication. Keep your employers or clients updated on your progress and notify them in advance if any delays or issues arise. Use professional communication channels such as email, messaging apps, or video calls as appropriate. This builds trust and avoids misunderstandings, making your work relationships stronger and more effective.

### Leverage Technology and Automation

To maximize productivity in part-time remote work, use technology to your advantage. Tools like project management software, time tracking apps, and automation can streamline your workflow. For instance, scheduling social media posts or automating invoice generation saves time and frees you up to focus on tasks that require your unique skills. Staying updated on relevant tools also keeps you competitive for remote jobs.

### Set Boundaries to Avoid Burnout

One of the common challenges for part-time remote workers is the temptation to overwork. Since you are working from home, it’s easy to blur the lines between work and leisure time. Set firm boundaries such as no work during family time or after certain hours. Taking regular breaks during your work sessions can also boost your efficiency and mental well-being.

### Develop Self-Discipline and Motivation

Working part-time remotely requires self-motivation because you often don’t have supervisors physically checking in. To stay on track, set daily goals and reward yourself when you meet them. Whether it’s a short walk, a coffee break, or your favorite snack, small rewards encourage consistent effort. Keeping a positive mindset helps you handle distractions and maintain high performance.

### Continuously Upgrade Your Skills

Remote online jobs for individuals seeking part-time income often demand adaptability. By investing time in learning new skills or certifications related to your field, you increase your chances of landing better or more diverse remote work opportunities. Free or affordable platforms offer flexible learning schedules that fit nicely around part-time work.

### Be Mindful of Your Health

Spending many hours sitting at your desk can negatively impact physical health. Incorporate stretches, exercises, or short walks into your daily routine. Also, pay attention to your eye health by following the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Prioritizing rest and a balanced diet contributes to sustained productivity and overall well-being.

### Build a Support System

Engaging with others who also work remotely part-time can provide motivation and advice. Join online communities or social media groups where members share job leads, tips, and experiences. Having someone to share your challenges or successes with helps reduce the isolation that may come from remote work.

By applying these strategies, you can thrive in remote online jobs for individuals seeking part-time income while maintaining harmony between work and personal life. Success comes from planning, dedication, and taking care of yourself as you navigate the flexible world of part-time remote employment.

</div>### Conclusion

Finding remote online jobs for individuals seeking part-time income opens up a world of flexible opportunities. Whether you’re looking to supplement your current earnings or explore new skills, part-time remote work offers the freedom to design your schedule while earning money from the comfort of home. By exploring roles such as freelance writing, virtual assisting, online tutoring, or customer support, you can find positions that align with your interests and availability.

Success in part-time remote work hinges on managing your time effectively and setting clear boundaries. Prioritizing tasks, creating a dedicated workspace, and maintaining regular communication with employers help you stay productive and professional. Balancing work with your personal life becomes easier when you establish routines and learn to say no to distractions. This approach not only boosts your performance but also preserves your well-being.

If you want to thrive in part-time remote jobs, staying organized and proactive is key. Keep learning and adapting to changes in technology and market demands to increase your earning potential. Remember, remote work is not just about making money—it’s about finding a rhythm that supports your lifestyle while reaching your financial goals. With the right strategies and mindset, you can create a rewarding remote work experience that fits seamlessly into your busy life.

things are going well we've made 12,513  bits, and have completely sold out. I vastly underestimated the demand for cidery the ponies here are raging alcoholics. And there is no legal drinking age, selling cidery to kids is definitely not my finest moment but it's very profitable. I will invest the bits we made into increasing production and a few helping hooves for the construction of our home.

Every ones been getting along well enough for now but i don't know how long that will last. Rex is not happy with all the bits Loris is spending on tea but, it's best to let Loris get his tea it keeps him happy. Pawtton is buying some coffee Rex would be anger, if he was not a caffeine addict, Douclaw is also a caffeine addict, tartarus all of the crew are caffeine addicts now that i think about it. 

I've taken a few walks through the Everfree forest it reminds me of home it's not exactly like the Flusion i come from but its the closest thing i've found. Some may think it just pure chaos, but like any nature it has rules, strange rules but they still exist. on my long walks i've been pondering my past well not all of my past, just the time i spent on my home world i remember so little of it. I think i was married but i don't know if that came with my political position or if it was a normal relationship, i think i had a son but its hard to say for sure. When i finally get back i don't think i will try to continue those relationships, i mean what would i even say to them? Hey honey it been six eons and i've conquered everything to ever exist and before you ask no i not joking i am completely serious. Yea no, love is over rated any way it's just never been fun for me. I mean the last date i went on was with a Blorg empress three eons ago, and it ended with me shooting her and after that we conquered their empire. Hmm... maybe i never gave this love thing a fair chance, oh well i don't think i can even find any one in my the acceptable age rang i can't think of any one else that's six eons old, well i suppose i'm still biologically 47. Who knows i am bored enough that maybe i'll give love another chance.

And I will trail off. Beware. I'm kind of toasted and listening to music.

So to get it out of the way, mainly I'm extremely dissatisfied with where I am at in life. I am 37, living with my mother (which I'm thankful that I have the option for), I have a new decent job, I've had a brain tumor, I have two cats, and I cannot get into my hobbies. I'm basically a fit George. Balding on the crown included, and possibly the height. He wasn't the tall one. Neither am I!

So, early Feb 24 I was laid off, along with a bunch of other people. I was in a decent spot. Collections Supervisor. Which good fucking god. I cannot believe I wasted so much of my life doing that. But it does look good on a resume. That's what I tell myself. I was there for almost a decade. I'm disappointed, too. 

I just can't seem to care enough to get things going for MYSELF. In my life I have done the following: Accepted into grad school and dropped out after a year (it was a four year program for a Masters) because I just did not want to do that with my life. Got a NASM personal training cert (it's expired. I hated working for a gym and charging people too much for 30 minutes. Ridiculous.). Got a real estate license (hated it). 

So I can do things. All I did was read the books and study for real estate and NASM, so I'm glad I didn't pay to take classes for those. But when it comes to pushing through and doing it for myself, building a business, I just can't. I do not care enough about myself to do that. That has always been a consistent theme throughout my life. I care about myself enough to the point of preventing bad things from happening to me that would be a burden on others. For example, if it weren't for my mother and my niece, I would have nothing holding me back from just not being alive (not a depression post in that sense!) and to be fair, I've already been to a point where I've already accepted death.

Which doesn't help with my ""I don't care about me"" thing. I kind of do. I care about my health as long as I'm alive. I'm not going to ruin my favorite hobby just to get into terrible health. Honestly, if the brain tumor didn't take me out, why should I? Regarding the brain tumor, I suppose I look back at it with fondness. I got out of it as well as I could. All I have is a line, temple to temple, where they folded my face down. I like to say that I got a free facelift out of it. However, during that time, it was scary. Getting the email, getting the phone call (in that order lol), being told ""Hey, remember that other issue? That's going on the backburner. You have multiple growths in your head"". That's a moment where you call your boss and lay on the couch (because covid).

So after some months, after having my surgery postponed because I got covid, I had fully prepared mentally for everything. I was still going to be nervous for the surgery, as one should be. But I was ready to just get the chemo and the radiation done. I'll just do it, be sick if I must, and move past it once it's finally over. If I wasn't going to wake up from surgery, that's fine because being under and out is painless and pretty much how I'd want to be. But after the surgery, it was over. Benign multiple growths with no real tumor that started it, and it was all scraped out. So apparently something pretty rare. Woo. I got out of it as well as I could. I did learn a lot by asking my surgeon everything I wanted (what a cool woman and INCREDIBLY TALENTED). With it, I like to joke that I had one so you can't say this or that, but when someone DOES have one, that's when I get serious and do my best to let them know that they will be okay. Unfortunately, I've already had to do that. But I was right! He's getting better!

Regarding love life, not great! I did have a girlfriend during the brain tumor debacle. However, months later, I saw a naughty text, and just ended it. I'm not playing that game and I didn't really want a future with her anyways. Never married. No kids. Loser bachelor life. Now that my mother has moved back (she was out of town helping with my niece for five years), I currently have zero confidence in finding a woman. SO... I'm getting an apartment real soon where I can stare at screens with my cats. My niece is also pushing REAL hard at me getting married so she can be a flower girl. So...that doesn't help the pressure. However, I'm perfectly content being alone, it's been accepted. However, it would be nice if I was wrong, I can't lie about that. 

Money? I was laid off in the start of 24. I decided to take some time off as I've been working consistently since I've been 15, despite people saying what a mistake that was. My apologies for enjoying my life while I'm relatively healthy /s. Went to Hawaii to see my niece and took a cute picture with a dolphin. I did kind of underestimate finding a job. I wasn't going to do anything phone related, that's for sure. I finally found something suitable, and the pay is almost the same so I'm satisfied. My tax return was sweet, so it's coming together. I diiiiid use investments to fund the end of it. In hindsight, not a bad idea!

Regarding hobbies, I just don't have it in me and unfortunately, I barely had it in me during my unemployment reign. I was not proud or happy that entire time, but I'm thankful for my friends who let me have fun with them. Video games are hard to get into, and I end up playing Heroes of the Storm so I can get to bedtime and tomorrow can happen and so on. I did love to write. I think I almost got finished with a book. It's locked up in my drive. Thousands of words, gone to waste. I haven't touched that in about 2-3 years, though. I have no idea what I'll garden this year (hopefully pickles..). Weightlifting is pretty much the only thing keeping me active. I do that about four times a week. However, the bummer is that my right shoulder has been slightly injured for QUITE a while. I've been doing exercises to strengthen it but I hate being older. I suppose I am thankful that despite this rough depressive phase of my life, I'm still being active.

I also like doing projects, and I have one that I aim to publish. Mainly my grandfathers journal in 1945 while he was in a Czech humanitarian group, all written in a very hard to read and little Czech. But it's a type of cursive that is no longer used before. I've attempted to see if elderly Czechs locally can read it, but they were unable to. I've used AI to translate, I just haven't finished it. Are we seeing a theme? 

So, I know I should see a therapist. I have, a couple of times in my life. The last one was not great. She couldn't even figure out after months that I have a form of body dysmorphia. For example, I forever feel small, despite being measured at 5'7. When I use the 70lbs dumbbells, they look small in my hands, but pretty big in everyone else's. I'm not a bitter person about height. I'm kind of shallow, so I get it. I've accepted that a looong time ago. Plus, I've dated taller (and one time much taller) and that's always cool. 

I feel like I've accepted a lot of things early in life. I got over religion pretty young because it just didn't make sense, and now I'm kind of against organized religion but not enough to be a dick about it. I'm a confirmed Catholic, if that makes senses. My view of death is the curtains are closed, all black. If I'm wrong, that's cool. I say that because I feel very grounded, and honestly the brain tumor further anchored me into my beliefs (and for those who say that God had a plan with the tumors, goooo F yourself). It just confuses me why and how a person could be grounded, but be so damn miserable. I've been told I'm an old soul with a young heart, so that's neat. 

I think I'm good with the vent. I won't be going on any anti-depressants. I've been down that road for years and after they cut the bad part of my brain out I decided it could handle not being on it. I was right! I've noticed nothing and it has been months, except for maybe more energy...but that could be the coffee. For now, my plan is just continue on, keep being nice, keep being strong, and try not to be a bitter person.",1,1744860180.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

Abstract/TLDR: My first ""real"" boyfriend isn't great with his phone, and when he never responds to me I feel really down. I'm trying not to be obsessed with him, but struggling, and need some feedback on that.

Relationship Context: Recently in college I met a guy (21M) in class. He's what you might consider an all-American: handsome, active, smart, and social. I (22F), on the other hand, am not the most attractive (a little pudgy, went to community college, etc.). After being friends for about a month, and having coffee together twice, I bit the bullet and asked him on a date, and he said that he ""would like that."" But we were both busy that week, and then it was spring break and we both went home, but we persevered and went on that date. I think it went well, although it lacked physical contact. Then I asked him if he wanted to be in a relationship, and he said ""sure, why not?"" with a sweet intonation, and I was happy although I thought the phrasing was a little awkward. Then when I suggested we should go on a second date, he said ""absolutely"" with a smile on his face. It's been a week since then, and we've barely seen each other in person, but he still seems interested in me, suggesting today that we meet up outside of class again this weekend.

Underlying all this is communication. In person, it's wonderful. We talk, and chat, and yap, and laugh. Not in person, though, is an issue. He barely responds to his phone, no matter what I text. I try to be friendly, invite him out, ask him a question, or something, about every other day. He almost never directly responds, and when he does, it's a day or three late. When he texts me it's usually just a question about something school-related. I know he's a really busy person. I get it. We all are in college. But when he goes a full weekend without responding to me, I start to feel down. I doubt myself, wondering if I said something wrong, or if he decided to stop liking me. It's not a fun emotional place to be! Obviously I really like this guy because it effects me so much. The guys I've dated in the past never made me feel quite like this when I was being ignored, but I also never got beyond a first, casual date with them. My question is: how do I get out of this mental state? How can I train myself to be less down when he doesn't respond to me? I'd really like to think of him and smile, but when he's not around me, it's hard to do that.

Maybe I need more than reddit to answer this, but I'd love to hear feedback on this from anyone. What worked for you, if you were in this situation? What didn't?

* I know by hearth that drinking coffein is the number one flare producer 
* This kind of message is my most scared for message I never hope to hear on a cruise

Around 2:55 a ship wide message went through all cabines ""Crew Alert! First Responders to Deck 1"". This can only mean a couple of things on a big ship as a cruise. Most of the time it's either Fire or Water (Or an overly and definitly save decision by the captain). 

  
A couple of min go by and no update comes. Fully awake due to being used to recive on call duty calls (I work as an IT Administrator), my mind goes through all possible routes. 

Shoes? Bordcard and Passport, Smartphone, additional clothing, emergency route to our station, even where our current ship position to get a quick guess on how long rescue forces might take. 

  
Then after nearly 10 long min. We get the ""All first responders stand down"" and the explaination. ""Waterpipe did burst in the laundry area and the water sensors where triggered. Definitly the right call for the ship. Definitly bad position for me. 

Didn't get any more sleep and so I only sleeped close between 2-3 hours. The day was fully packed to not really a chance.   
I did what every reasonable person would to ... a cup of coffee. (and maybe a tiny sip of energy, because .. coffein is already in the system. What difference would it make.) Last time it went ok, and drinking coke a couple of days earlier went well too. 

Little did I know. 

The day itself made me way to overenthusiastic so I outed myself as trans towards my 2 friends that where with me on the cruise. 

The evening had it comming for me. I thought yes .. MTX Day .. the coffein can't be that bad.   
And at first I was right. It was a bit of pain but it was managable. Later when I went to sleep I was in for a treat though. 

Lying down was the problem. Additionoal to pain Neck, Hip (rightside) and shoulder (leftside), I was kinda getting a common cold. Sleeping impossible. Gotten another 3 hours. This time no coffee though. 

  
Since I have to delay my Prednisolon for a one or two more days before I can take another one, I kinda sitting in pain and have to wait for it to subsidise. Not really enjoying it but what can you do, at least sitting upright works out fine. (Laying down is the bad part.

Akamai Tooth Powder is a novel dental hygiene product poised to revolutionize the way we approach teeth whitening and oral care. This innovative powder promises a natural and effective alternative to traditional toothpaste and whitening strips, appealing to consumers seeking a holistic approach to dental health.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Akamai Tooth Powder boasts a unique formulation and several noteworthy features designed to optimize oral health and whitening efficacy.

**Ingredient Composition:** Akamai tooth powder utilizes a blend of natural ingredients including activated charcoal, bentonite clay, calcium carbonate, and essential oils. The activated charcoal is known for its adsorption properties, helping to draw out stains and impurities from the tooth surface. The bentonite clay aids in remineralization and provides a gentle abrasive action. Calcium carbonate acts as a mild abrasive, assisting in the removal of plaque and surface stains. The specific blend of essential oils, such as peppermint and tea tree, are chosen for their antibacterial and breath-freshening properties.

**Remineralization Properties:** Unlike some whitening products that can weaken enamel, Akamai tooth powder focuses on remineralization. The presence of bentonite clay, rich in minerals like calcium and magnesium, helps to replenish the minerals lost from enamel due to acidic foods and drinks.

**pH Balance:** Akamai Tooth Powder is formulated to maintain a neutral pH in the mouth. A neutral pH environment helps to discourage the growth of harmful bacteria that contribute to tooth decay and gum disease.

**Natural and Vegan Friendly:** The formula is entirely plant-based, devoid of any animal-derived products making it suitable for vegan users. Further, the ingredients are sourced responsibly to minimize environmental impact.

Key features of the Akamai Tooth Powder include:
* Natural whitening
* Enamel remineralization
* Vegan-friendly formula
* Antibacterial properties

 ## Core Benefits

Akamai Tooth Powder provides several core benefits that set it apart from traditional whitening methods and toothpastes.

**Effective Whitening:** The combination of activated charcoal and gentle abrasives in Akamai Tooth Powder effectively removes surface stains caused by coffee, tea, wine, and other staining agents. Users report a noticeable difference in the brightness of their smile within just a few weeks of regular use. For instance, many customers have shared before-and-after photos showcasing a visibly brighter smile after just a month of daily use.

**Enhanced Oral Hygiene:** Beyond whitening, Akamai Tooth Powder contributes to improved oral hygiene. The antibacterial properties of essential oils like tea tree oil help to fight harmful bacteria in the mouth, reducing the risk of cavities and gum disease.

**Enamel Protection and Remineralization:** Unlike harsh chemical whitening treatments, Akamai Tooth Powder helps to strengthen enamel through remineralization. The bentonite clay and calcium carbonate work to replenish lost minerals, making teeth less susceptible to sensitivity and decay. This translates to healthier, stronger teeth over time.

**Fresher Breath:** The inclusion of peppermint essential oil ensures a fresh and clean feeling after each use. This provides immediate fresh breath without the artificial flavorings found in many traditional toothpastes.

 ## FAQs Section

**Is Akamai Tooth Powder safe for sensitive teeth?**

 ## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

When considering Akamai Tooth Powder, evaluate your individual needs and preferences regarding oral hygiene.

Its focus on natural ingredients, enamel remineralization, and effective whitening makes it a worthwhile consideration for those seeking a holistic approach to oral health. While the price point may be slightly higher than some conventional toothpastes, the added benefits of a natural and remineralizing formula make it a valuable investment in your long-term dental health. This powder may very well be one of the best whitening solutions in 2025.

I made the mistake of deep diving on google and it said a dangerous hr is 100 or above at resting, sometimes mine is around 100-110 resting unless I'm lying down. Tonight, my hr is 80's while sitting, but when I stand up, it jumps to 120-130, I'm afraid my heart is working too hard and will suddenly give out on me, my oldest sister has POTS, and she keeps saying I seem to have some symptoms but my bp doesn't change from sitting to standing, and I don't get light headed or pass out. has anyone experienced this? I have an echocardiogram on the 23rd of this month, but I'm so confused all my other tests along with an EKG coming back completely clear when something is causing this? is this super dangerous? am I panicking over something reasonable or will I be okay?",1,1744859248.0,Cardiophobias,3,1.0,False

# 📌Outline

Min Jun  (**Chae Jong Hyeok**), a 28-year-old office worker, lives a boring life. He works from 9 to 5 and goes home every night, feeling pressure to do better but feeling stuck and unhappy with his job and love life.

Suddenly, after eight years since their messy breakup, his ex-boyfriend, Jin Hwan (**Sung Seung Ha**), who is also 28, comes back into his life as a new coworker. Jin Hwan still looks great and charming as ever and reminds Min Jun how different they are. Min Jun wants to keep his past out of his work life, so he tries to stick to his normal routine and keep things professional.

Min Jun believes that first loves should stay in the past. But Jin Hwan wants more than just friendship and hopes to start their romance again.

**Will things turn out better for them this time, or is it better to leave the past behind?**

# 📖Source material

Based on the web novel by Moscareto, ""Business as Usual"" also known as “Euls love”, tells the story of two men who once thought they were at a disadvantage in their relationship. 

**Eul** is a term that describes a dynamic in which one person is focused on the needs and feelings of another, often believing they must adjust their own behavior to accommodate the other person.

Eight years after their romance, fate brings them back together in the workplace, where they must confront the lingering misunderstandings of their past. Moscareto is also known for another office BL novel, **""The New Employee,""** which has been adapted into [this series](https://mydramalist.com/723389-the-new-employee). There is also [a movie version](https://mydramalist.com/759455-the-new-employee-movie), which I personally prefer, due to an added kissing scene in that.

# 📝Summary episode 2

Here’s a summary from last week's episode, 2. For a summary, complete with GIFs for episode 1, [see the end of this post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/s/AcOGYemW99)

In the first scene of episode 2, we see Min Jun at his job at AR Publishing, looking unwell. His coworkers are concerned because he never takes a day off, but he insists he just had one day off to rest. J[in Hwan notices the conversation](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fjbdi25m5i6ue1.gif) and checks in on Min Jun through a message, but Min Jun doesn’t reply. The intern, Jin Soo, asks Min Jun about work and mentions that Jin Hwan must have been popular in college since they went to the same university. Min Jun agrees. Watching Jin Hwan interact with colleagues reminds Min Jun of their college days, and he briefly closes his eyes, only to be interrupted by Jin Hwan, who tells him they need to go to a meeting.

In the meeting, things feel a bit awkward as Jin Hwan comments that Min Jun looks busy. Min Jun bluntly says that the company takes advantage of its employees. Jin Hwan mentions that Woo Hyuk knew Min Jun worked there, surprising Min Jun. They talk about their past, and [Jin Hwan notes that Min Jun seems to have changed](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fufs8xjvai6ue1.gif), allowing himself to express his dislikes. Min Jun agrees it has been tiring to always adjust. Jin Hwan praises Min Jun for being able to speak up now, leading to an awkward silence until Jin Soo arrives with coffee.

The meeting then focus on a new project, a dating manual concept that Min Jun explains. It will be a simulation game with a 2000s Y2K vibe (I googled that, apparently people born in the early 2000 have a nostalgic feeling about that period), where players make choices and follow a story guided by a friendly non-player character (NPC) and a tutorial. Jin Hwan reads parts of the table of contents, asking Min Jun if he thinks dating has a manual. Min Jun isn't sure but thinks people struggling with dating could use guidance. We hear Min Jun's voiceover, stating, ""because I dated submissively myself."" (I'd like to note that another title for ""Business as Usual"" is ""Eul's Love,"" a concept I've explained earlier in this post) 

The scene shifts back to eight years ago in college. Min Jun is in an easy liberal arts class, but the professor announces weekly assignments. When asked about their dreams, students mention dating and partying, while [Min Jun writes down wanting to take a class with someone he likes](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fy0h5zn2hi6ue1.gif). He sits alone in the classroom and after class while everyone else has friends to meet, he is again alone. [Walking on campus](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fbp46w3qii6ue1.gif), he only sees students who are friends or in a relationship. That evening, he goes to a cafe and tries to step out of his comfort zone. A [handsome guy compliments him and pours him a drink](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F712ymbeki6ue1.gif), leading Min Jun to buy an expensive bottle of whiskey, (230.000 won is 155 euro) for him, which surprises him when he sees the price. Min Jun feels deceived, always the underdog, and ends up getting drunk at the bar.

Another day, while walking on campus, Min Jun spots Jin Hwan in a group. [They notice each other](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F7bvq5btli6ue1.gif), but Min Jun feels overwhelmed and runs away. In the next scene, Jin Hwan is sitting behind Min Jun in class and returns a pen to him. They discuss their earlier encounter, with Jin Hwan teasingly asking if Min Jun was running away because of their eye contact. They discover they are the same age, freshman, and Jin Hwan confidently asks for [Min Jun’s phone number](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F7bvq5btli6ue1.gif), complimenting him with his pretty name. And that he actually saw him recently, when he hit his head on the bar. Min Jun is embarrassed, but Jin Hwan said it was cute, just like Min Jun was acting now, also cute. Min Jun seems happy after their conversation.

And indeed, if you rewind the scene at the bar, there are some guys around the billiardtable, one is wearing a checkered shirt, the same one, Jin Hwan wore earlier that day when he was asleep in class.

When on some day, as Min Jun is heading home, he [receives a message from Jin Hwan asking what he’s up to](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fzqdol3moi6ue1.gif). They meet up, but Jin Hwan quickly hides from his friends who want him to go to a club. They share a moment touching hands, and Jin Hwan invites Min Jun to eat together. Woo Hyuk helps distract Jin Hwan's friends so they can have some time alone. 

While they eat by the river, Jin Hwan ignores a call from Woo Hyuk, saying it’s not important. Min Jun gets a call from Woo Hyuk, who insists Jin Hwan should answer his phone. Jin Hwan, feeling reluctant, speaks into Min Jun's phone, ""I'll go when I feel like it."" He complains that his friends are always urging him to go out. What's interesting is that Woo Hyuk has Min Jun’s number, and when Min Jun responds to the call, Jin Hwan glances at the screen, his expression suggesting he anticipated it was Woo Hyuk. Meanwhile, Woo Hyuk is texting, [mentioning that their two friends are starting to get anxious](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fxu9lzl96j6ue1.gif) and asking if Jin Hwan could at least make a brief appearance. 

Min Jun encourages Jin Hwan to go see his friends, noting how close they seem, which he finds nice and a bit enviable. This prompts Jin Hwan to suggest that Min Jun should join him and his friends. However, Min Jun declines. Jin Hwan insists he doesn’t want to go alone, and eventually, Min Jun gives in, agreeing to accompany him. Jin Hwan is thrilled, but we hear Min Jun's voiceover cautioning, ""Don’t say what you don’t mean.""

At the café, the friends note that they haven't seen Jin Hwan much lately, but they agree it was Woo Hyuk who managed to bring him out. Jin Hwan says that he brought his Min Jun along today. 

Woo Hyuk is asking [why Jin Hwan and Min Jun are so close to each other](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fg1owlopbj6ue1.gif). Jin Hwan tells him to ignore it. Woo Hyuk then suggests to Min Jun that he leave Jin Hwan and join him for a drink. ""It is my loss that I am nice to you,"" says Woo Hyuk to Jin Hwan, who pretends to get angry and asks if Woo Hyuk is jealous. They talk back and forth in a teasing manner and are very close, touching, while Min Jun feels like a fifth wheel, excluded.

The friends warn Min Jun to be cautious and not to trust Jin Hwan, claiming he will betray him. Jin Hwan seems angry at their comments, insisting that Min Jun is different from them. His friends want to keep Jin Hwan around primarily to help them attract girls it seems, something they struggle with when he's not around.

Just then, two girls walk in and ask Jin Hwan for help in talking to them, but he declines. Jin Hwan to complain to Min Jun about how bothersome they are. 

After a while, the two friends return, unsuccessful with the girls, and they all share drinks. Later, Min Jun comes back from the restroom and notices Woo Hyuk and Jin Hwan huddled closely together,[ whispering and looking at a phone](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fpn6fwk3nj6ue1.gif). Jin Hwan caresses Woo Hyuk's face before they step outside, leaving Min Jun with an uneasy feeling that’s hard to ignore. Outside, [Woo Hyuk has his arm draped over Jin Hwan's shoulder](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F35s1b1gtj6ue1.gif), further deepening Min Jun’s discomfort.

As Min Jun walks home alone, [he pulls out his phone to message](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F03s04udxj6ue1.gif) Jin Hwan, asking about his relationship with Woo Hyuk. However, he hesitates and deletes the message, opting instead to search online for ""How to tell if someone is leading you on."" The advice he finds is not promising: signs include excessive touching, not making calls when with friends, and being overly nice to everyone, indicating that he might not be special to them.

Back in the present, Min Jun and Jin Hwan are about to leave the conference room when [Jin Hwan asks for Min Jun’s phone number](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fzjpofpq0k6ue1.gif), saying he’ll be in touch. Min Jun notices that Jin Hwan hasn’t changed his number, unlike himself. Later that evening, as the office is nearly empty, [Min Jun receives a call](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F0mix3gw3k6ue1.gif). It’s Jin Hwan, who is standing nearby when Min Jun turns around and asks him to dinner. It's eerily reminiscent of their college days. Jin Hwan mentions their reunion after eight years, but Min Jun doesn’t appear thrilled. In a voiceover, he wonders if he can ever escape his exhausting first love for Jin Hwan.

In the epilogue, we return to the club where Jin Hwan and Woo Hyuk are still outside. Their friends comment that it looks like they’re dating, but the one with glasses insists they are just friends. The other friend suggests that Min Jun might actually believe they’re more than that. However, the glasses-wearing friend counters that the two have been close for ages. Then, in a surprising remark, [the other guy speculates that Jin Hwan might be](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F6qxywx18k6ue1.gif) Woo Hyuk, who is wealthy, arranged partner. As unanswered questions swirl in Min Jun's mind, he struggles with what he has heard and seen.

I prepped with bone broth and yoghurt, took a little magnesium, drank black coffee, tea, and water. I added electrolytes on day three when my urine cleared. I broke the fast today with broth, soup, salad, turkey, and yoghurt for probiotics. Feeling great.

## What is Ethereon Edge?

**Ethereon Edge** is an automated trading platform designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other digital assets with the assistance of AI algorithms. Think of it as your virtual trading assistant — it analyzes market trends in real-time and places trades for you based on pre-set strategies or user preferences.

It’s geared toward users who want a hands-off approach to trading. You don’t need to be a chart-reading wizard or a full-time trader. The automation does most of the heavy lifting. And if you're someone who still enjoys manual control, it provides that option too.

## Who Created Ethereon Edge?

Like many platforms in the automated trading space, the creators of Ethereon Edge remain somewhat under the radar. There’s no single known founder or public-facing team, which might raise some eyebrows — and honestly, it should.

That said, this isn’t unique. Platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** follow the same model. These platforms often operate behind a network of developers and financial analysts who prefer anonymity, possibly to avoid regulatory scrutiny or unwanted attention.

So while the lack of transparency isn’t ideal, it’s not a deal-breaker if the platform functions well and handles your funds securely — which, in my experience, it mostly does.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Ethereon Edge Today](https://tinyurl.com/bdfmhzc7)
## How Does Ethereon Edge Work?

At its core, **Ethereon Edge uses AI-driven algorithms** to analyze large sets of market data. It scans for patterns, predicts potential price movements, and then executes trades automatically. This is similar to how hedge funds use algorithmic trading, just packaged for everyday users.

Here’s how it works in practice:

- You deposit funds (minimum $250)
- The AI scans the market for trade opportunities
- Trades are executed automatically or with your approval (you choose)
- You can monitor everything from a dashboard that's actually pretty intuitive

The platform also offers a **demo account**, which is great for testing before you commit real money.

## Ethereon Edge Pros and Cons

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Beginner-friendly** – You don’t need technical skills to get started
- ✅ **AI-powered trades** – Removes emotional decision-making
- ✅ **Demo mode** – Practice with virtual money first
- ✅ **Supports multiple assets** – Not just crypto
- ✅ **24/7 customer support** – Responsive and helpful in my tests

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Lack of transparency** – No clear info on who’s behind it
- ❌ **Not regulated** – Could be a dealbreaker for some investors
- ❌ **Requires initial deposit** – Can’t explore full features without $250

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Ethereon Edge?

Ethereon Edge is **fully web-based**, which means no downloads required.

You can access it from:
- ✅ Desktop (Windows, Mac)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS, Android)
- ✅ Tablets

There’s no official mobile app (yet), but the website is well-optimized for mobile. I used it on my phone during a commute — clean interface, no lag, and all features were accessible.

## Ethereon Edge – Supported Countries

Ethereon Edge is available in **most countries**, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and across much of Europe.

However, some countries with stricter crypto regulations (like North Korea, Iran, and parts of the Middle East) might have limited access. Always check if your country is supported before signing up.

## Ethereon Edge – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform uses **machine learning** to crunch massive sets of market data and identify profitable trade setups. It reacts to news, technical indicators, and price action — all in real-time. This means you can capitalize on short-term volatility without staying glued to the screen.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you're new to crypto, the dashboard is **clean and easy to navigate**. Charts are simple, and all your key stats—like profit/loss, trade history, and account balance—are front and center. 

It avoids that cluttered, overwhelming look that some platforms suffer from.

### Mobile Accessibility

The site runs smoothly on mobile browsers. While it doesn’t have a dedicated app, the **responsive design** makes it easy to trade on the go. I placed a couple of trades from my phone while waiting in line for coffee — no issues.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **price alerts, trade confirmations, and risk levels**. These alerts are sent via email or SMS, keeping you in the loop even if you’re not actively monitoring the platform.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Ethereon Edge isn’t just for crypto. You can also trade:
- Forex
- Stocks
- Commodities

That’s a big plus if you want to diversify your portfolio without jumping between platforms.

## Is Ethereon Edge a Scam?

Short answer: **No, it doesn’t appear to be a scam**, but it’s not perfect either.

I tested deposits and withdrawals multiple times — funds showed up in my bank account within 24-48 hours. The trading algorithms performed reasonably well, and the customer support was responsive.

So while it lacks third-party audits or regulatory backing, **Ethereon Edge seems to function as advertised**. Still, I’d recommend starting small and only investing what you can afford to lose — same advice I’d give for any platform.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Ethereon Edge?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for these kinds of platforms.

This deposit gives you access to the live trading environment, and from my experience, it was enough to start seeing small gains. You can always add more later once you’re comfortable.

### Ethereon Edge Customer Support

Customer support is available via:
- ✅ Live chat (fastest)
- ✅ Email (responded within 12 hours)
- ✅ FAQ section (decent, but limited)

I tested the live chat a few times — average response time was under 5 minutes, and the reps were knowledgeable and polite.

## How do you start trading on Ethereon Edge?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official website and fill out the sign-up form. You’ll need:
- Full name
- Email address
- Phone number

No credit card required at this stage.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once you register, you’ll be connected to a **regulated broker**. You’ll need to verify your identity (basic KYC stuff) and then make your first deposit of $250.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding your account, you can:
- Use the **demo account** to get comfortable
- Switch to live mode and let the algorithm trade for you
- Set your own risk preferences or stop-loss orders

It takes less than 30 minutes to go from sign-up to live trading.

## How to Delete an Ethereon Edge Account?

To delete your account:
1. Contact customer support via email or live chat
2. Request account deletion
3. Withdraw any remaining funds before doing so

They typically verify your identity and process the request within 2–3 business days. It’s not instant, but it's straightforward.

## The Verdict

**Ethereon Edge is a solid option** if you're looking for an automated trading platform that’s easy to use, packed with features, and beginner-friendly.

If you’re new to crypto or just want a less time-consuming way to trade, **Ethereon Edge is worth checking out** — just don’t bet the farm on it.

## What is Swap Lasix?

Swap Lasix is an **automated trading platform** that helps users trade digital assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and even commodities. The main selling point? It uses **AI and real-time data analysis** to make smarter trades for you—or at least help guide your decisions.

What makes it stand out from other platforms is that it doesn’t just execute trades based on simple bots. It claims to adapt to market trends using machine learning, which is a fancy way of saying it gets better the more you use it. It’s built for people who want to trade efficiently without spending all day watching price charts.

## Who Created Swap Lasix?

Swap Lasix was reportedly developed by a group of fintech engineers and crypto enthusiasts. While the exact founders haven't plastered their names all over the site (which is common with platforms in this niche), the system shows similarities to platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**—which suggests it might be part of a broader white-label network of trading platforms.

Even though the creators aren't super public, the functionality and design show that some solid tech minds are behind it. There's a level of polish here that you don’t often see in fly-by-night operations.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Swap Lasix Today](https://tinyurl.com/3d4nww6v)
## How Does Swap Lasix Work?

At its core, Swap Lasix uses **AI-powered algorithms** to scan market data in real-time and execute trades based on trends, indicators, and price patterns. You can either let it run in auto-mode or use it manually with real-time insights.

Here’s a simple breakdown:

- **Automated Mode**: The platform places trades for you based on pre-set strategies.
- **Manual Mode**: You get real-time alerts and analysis so you can make your own trades.
- **Risk Settings**: You can customize how aggressive or conservative you want your trading to be.

It connects to various exchanges or brokers depending on your region and asset class. Once you fund your account, the system starts suggesting trades—or executing them automatically if you’ve enabled that.

## Swap Lasix Pros and Cons

You can access it on:
- **Desktop or Laptop** (Windows, Mac)
- **Mobile devices** (iOS and Android)
- **Tablet browsers**

There’s no standalone app yet, but the mobile browser version works surprisingly well. Pages load fast, and the layout is optimized for smaller screens.

## Swap Lasix – Supported Countries

Swap Lasix is available in a wide range of countries, but it’s **not global** just yet. It works in most of **Europe, Asia, Oceania, and parts of South America**. The U.S. has limited access due to regulatory reasons, which is pretty common with automated trading platforms.

If you’re unsure whether it’s available in your country, the signup form usually tells you right away based on your IP address or the info you provide.

## Swap Lasix – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Swap Lasix’s AI is constantly scanning the market for price changes, trends, and indicators. It’s like having a full-time analyst working for you—without the analyst salary.

This feature is especially handy during volatile market swings. It reacts faster than a human can and helps you avoid emotional trades.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean and intuitive. You don’t need to be a finance geek to use it. The main controls are labeled clearly, and the setup process is pretty much plug-and-play.

Even if you’ve never traded before, you’ll get the hang of it within a few sessions.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no native app yet, the mobile browser version is *really* good. I tested it on both Android and iOS, and the experience was smooth.

You can check your trades, set alerts, and even fund your account—all from your phone while standing in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set alerts for price movements, trade executions, and even news-related events. This helps you stay informed without being glued to the screen 24/7.

Want to know when BTC drops below $30K or ETH spikes by 5%? Boom—set an alert.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Swap Lasix isn’t just for crypto. You can also trade **forex, commodities, and indices**. This makes it a solid option for people who want to diversify without opening five different accounts.

The asset list isn’t as deep as a traditional broker, but it covers all the big names.

## Is Swap Lasix a Scam?

Let’s get real—there are a ton of shady platforms out there. But after testing and researching Swap Lasix, I can say it’s **not a scam**.

Here’s what gave me confidence:
- The platform actually works and **executes trades as promised**
- **Funds are accessible**, and withdrawals are processed (mine took 24 hours)
- There’s **customer support** that responds (not lightning fast, but solid)
- Offers a **demo account**, which scam platforms usually *don’t*

Still, like any trading platform, it’s not risk-free. Don’t dump your life savings into it.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Swap Lasix?

The **minimum deposit is $250**. That’s standard for platforms in this category (Bitcoin Code, Immediate Edge, etc.). It’s enough to start trading while minimizing risk, but I still recommend starting small and scaling up as you get comfortable.

### Swap Lasix Customer Support

Customer support is available via:
- **Live Chat**
- **Email**
- **Support Ticket System**

I tried the live chat and got a response in under 10 minutes. Not bad. They were helpful, though not super detailed. For more complex issues, email is the better route.

## How do you start trading on Swap Lasix?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Swap Lasix homepage and fill out a short form with your name, email, and phone number. It only takes a minute.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll get matched with a broker based on your region. Then you’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff) and deposit at least $250 to activate your account.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can either activate auto-trading or start using the dashboard for manual trades. I suggest starting in **demo mode** to get a feel for how it works.

## How to Delete a Swap Lasix Account?

If you ever decide to peace out, deleting your Swap Lasix account is pretty straightforward. Just contact customer support and request account deletion. You’ll want to **withdraw your funds first** before initiating deletion to avoid any complications.

Context:
Realized that I've been slaving away at work too much and have been left behind regarding current events and the vibe in general - literally it's been a blur. I attended a wedding of one of my hs barkadas last week with me just fying in that morning (Friday) and then flying back to the metro the morning right after (Saturday) because I had meetings already set on Monday and some stuff needing my signature. My whole barkada went to vacation (they're still there) to a remote island and I see they've been having so much fun. I'm very ok with my situation tho, I am comfortable. Ngl, lowkey jealous of many people that can have time to be carefree.

Recently been musing that I want 2025 to be the year I finally have my ISBN - i would need time to relax, free my head, and write (poetry). I just need  quiet time to relax and a place that's peaceful.

Long weekend's here and I don't have plans yet. I can invest in time and maybe make these next 4 days a build up of foundation for great new friendships. Not really keen on a relationship, I may have crossed over the line already for any interest. I just want to get to know the younger crowd and feed off good energy. I have gotten to know that a lot of people younger have great insights in life, are yearning to build up themselves (which I find fascinating a topic for writing) and definitely know more about the local scene.

Match 1: Gwanak Byeoksan FC 8-0 Gwanak AS FC  
Match 2:  Yangcheon TNT FC 2-0 Seongdong FC Together  
Match 3: Mapo Hampton EMC 0-5 Yongsan Geonyung FC  
Match 4: Jungnang District FC 1-5 Gangdong FC ITPL

\*\*\*\*\*

The K5 to K7 leagues are Korean’s amateur leagues. The K7 League is divided into small divisions based in small cities or districts in larger cities. K6 League divisions cover maybe half of a large city, and  K5 League will include all of a large city or an entire province. In the capital area, with its high population, there is a high concentration of divisions at all levels.

Today I’m on my way to watch the first round of the Seoul division of the K5 league. Unsurprisingly, the Seoul division has a few notable teams. In recent years, FC Byeoksan, based in Gwanak-gu, won the overall K5 title, and even made it to round three, where they fought valiantly but were ultimately defeated by a Gimpo FC that finished high in K2 that year. TNT FC is a club that takes pride in its professionalism. They claim to pay players match fees, and the club's mission is to prepare players for life in the professional leagues. TNT also has more weekly training sessions than any other team in this division. They train every day, while some teams train as few as two times a week. Lastly, there is KY FC (Geonyung FC), the team selected to represent Seoul in the 2025 Korea Cup.

Of the remaining three, ITPL’s goal seems to be to help players for life in other countries, which is understandable because the team was initially formed by a group of players who returned to Korea after studying abroad. FC Together claims to put team harmony above all else, while AS FC, Hampton EMC, and Jungnang District FC have information online.

Just before I left home, the skies darkened, and something that looked like snow started dropping from the black things that might have been clouds. And this was accompanied by winds so strong that it was shaking the outside sliding doors, and blowing plastic back up and over 15-floor apartment buildings. I had serious doubts about coming, but as quickly as the ominous weather appeared, it disappeared, and I gathered my resolve to go watch football.

Today’s Round 1  matches will be held in a public field tucked between Hanyang University and a feeder stream to the Han River. It’s a short walk from the subway station and easy to reach. I feel confident about the area because I attended the 2024 Homeless World Cup at Hanyang University. I have everything I need in a waterproof bag, and I’ll be early enough to find a hot lunch before the matches start.

On the way, I receive a message from my wife saying that the transfer station had a fire and I might need to find another way. While I’m scrambling to make sure I have everything for an early transfer, she sends a second message saying it was small and everything seems fine. Crisis averted, and I can go ahead with the original transfer. I eventually reach Konggug University, and since I’m at the end of the platform, I have a chance to look out the station windows for restaurants. There are a surprising number that I don’t remember seeing on the map. Even stranger, everything looks unfamiliar after I exit through the gates. Why? And why does that board say the train in the opposite direction goes to Hanyang University and Wangshimni?! \*Deep breath\*

Last year, while attending matches at the 2024 Homeless World Cup, I arrived at Hanyang University from the South. Coming from the West, I was caught off guard by how close the University is to the transfer station, never realised I went straight past. Now I’m three stops away and not within walking distance. I won’t have time to find lunch before the matches start, so I stop by the station bakery to grab some sad-looking bread before jumping back on the train. At Hanyang University, the correct station, I pick up a coffee to ward off the cold before heading to the playing field.

I know I’m at the right place when I get there, because I see FC Byeoksan’s fan club. It’s my third time at a Byeoksan match, and I know that no other K5 team in Seoul has one man with a drum and a handful of chants cheering them on. The teams are also ready to walk onto the field.

[The Battle Field](https://preview.redd.it/kab5nj2d4bve1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9d460aa1109b2ba5ac98ebf63512753e93f5131)

The field is so new that Kakao Maps' street view only shows construction work in the area. Now there is a large field with an artificial surface. The field has markings for one full-size pitch or two medium-sized pitches. There is a stand of sorts behind one of the goals. It consists of giant steps that serve as seats. There are five to ten spectators who I assume are either related to the team or friends and family. Who else would come all this way in this weather to watch Tier 5 football? That would just be silly. Next to the football field is a small baseball field, and throughout the afternoon, children and parents pass by to play in what I assume is the Korean version of Little League Baseball.

In the amateur leagues, all matches are played at a single location on the same day, one following another. In the K5 League, they play full 90-minute matches, and the four matches today will run from 1 pm to almost 8 pm. This is either amazing or ridiculous, depending on your viewpoint

The first match is a one-sided clash between FC Byeoksan vs AS FC. Most of the match is played in the AS half, where they allow a steady stream of goals. But what makes the match memorable is the weather. It shifts between overcast and sunny, rain and no rain, and sunny while raining. At one point, we had something too big and round to be snow, but too light and soft to be hail. It was during one of these snow-like periods that the match was briefly stopped. The field has no protection from wind, and the match is stopped when the wind blows so hard that players must shield their eyes. Boxes and chairs making their way onto the field don’t help either. All of this is happening at about 5 degrees Celsius, and you must admire the dedication of the players to stay on the field.

The match turnover is so rapid that when half-time arrives, the teams playing in the next match take the field to warm up. Just before the end of one match, the next teams are already lined up to take the field. As soon as the last player from the previous patch leaves the field, the teams run on, greet each other and take 5 minutes for a final warm-up before the match officially starts.

During the break in the Byeosan vs AS match, I scrape together the courage and go over to the Byeoksan fan to ask him his name. If I’m going to see him again, I’d like to say “Hello.” Frustratingly, I still don't know his name because he only gives me his YouTube channel name, “Uniq Footbal Fan”. I’m the 12th subscriber of the channel where he occasionally live-streams to talk about football, and interacts with the one or two people watching. He also records himself while he cheers and uploads it as a vlog, complete with an introduction about the day’s match.

The second match is the hardest fought of the day as TNT FC takes on FC Together. Both teams seem desperate to win, and tackles are nasty. Some of the tackles are so ridiculous that I’m wondering if I’m watching Association Football or Rugby Football. Near the end of the match, tensions boil over when a TNT player goes in too hard on a Together player.. It gets so heated that two referees have to rush and keep the players apart. And just when everything seems calm, the Together manager storms over, but is blocked by a team effort of one TNT and one Together player. I don't understand how that didn't start things up again. This is also the only match where there is obvious support. Together FC as a group of easily 20 people cheering them on, complete with team colour raincoats. But they have no drums or chants, so Byeoksan FC wins that battle.

[Hampton vs KY - Not confusing at all.](https://preview.redd.it/ev1ohdkn4bve1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=248e33af1b4a03fdee5f59ab552fe40c2b8de7db)

The third match is another one-sided one, with Hampton taking on Geonyung (KY) FC. KY’s dominance is not surprising since, as mentioned previously, they were Seoul’s K5 representative in the Korea Cup this season. But I don’t even notice the score, because I can't take my eyes off the [marshmallow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slT80EySpKk&ab_channel=1theK%28%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4%29) that is the KY keeper. The man had the genius idea to wear a padded jacket under his shirt. It looked ridiculous, and I love it. He seems a bit of a character. As soon as he arrives at his goal, he swings his arms around a few times, turns in my direction, pulls the strangest face, and exclaims in Korean: “It’s cold!” In case you didn't know, Koreans are genetically, culturally and possibly even legally required to state it out loud every time they feel cold. He also looks like one of the laziest keepers ever, but comfortably blocks every goal attempt. Although I didn't see the match, I hear he was on fire in the KY’s Korea Cup match. Despite not letting in even a single goal, he is substituted at half-time for a non-marshmallow-looking player. It reminded me of Seoul Martyrs FC, who always used both keepers, possibly to avoid letting one keeper concede more than 5 goals per match.The final match is Jungnang District FC vs FC ITPL. Earlier in the week, I contacted ITPL on Instagram and received a reply. I was hoping to chat with someone about the club, but I have no idea who I’m looking for, or even which of the two teams warming up is ITPL. Sure, I can just call someone over and ask which team is which, but I already spent my “talking to strangers” quota by contacting them on Instagram and then talking to the Byeoksan fan. I walk past the players warming up, hoping the person I chatted with on Instagram calls me, the only non-Korean over, but it doesn't happen, so I go back to the seating area to mope.

Without the prospect of talking to someone from ITPL, and with the sun setting behind the buildings, I decide that I will not be able to handle another two hours of the cold, and grudgingly go home. As much as I wanted to watch all four matches, I’m glad I went home. Even two hours later, after I’d been in the apartment for almost an hour and had dinner, I still feel cold.

1. The dog shit Jason Aaron Ninja run straight up ignores one thing that I feel defines Punisher. And these panels prove that. Micro is back from the dead offering Frank his family back. But that means making a deal with the devil, the sum of all evil, which is exactly who the Punisher hunts. All of a sudden now willingly become host to a demon called the “Beast”, who, he should know about since the whole Shadowland incident was caused by the Beast, makes zero sense, it actually makes negative sense. 

2. He still has feelings, regardless of how recently he’s painted as a one dimensional heartless killer. Whereas the Netflix version is more outward and outspoken with how he feels. Comic Frank is always more subtle. At the end of “In the Blood”, Henry thinks his mom has given him some hard to find records, when she tells him she had no idea where he was, and he realizes it was Frank all along. Same goes for the whole Franken-Castle bit, while not a traditional Punisher story, he essentially embodies the same war against a new foe. Regardless of whether innocents are human or monsters, he doesn’t tolerate the loss of innocent life. 

Whereas this is a run that paints him more cold hearted and rougher on the edges than others like Edmonson, who had him having coffee at diner and chatting up and becoming a regular. Regardless, I feel like it’s a run that while isn’t my favorite, does deserve more of a spotlight. Frank does what Frank does best, going after the bad guys regardless where on the food chain they may be. Also this was the series that gave us the Ant-Man Punisher scene, so bonus points there.

I had general abdominal discomfort and strong pain in my upper left abdominal area. Slightly elevated CBC markers and low fever. Liquid diet and cipro/Flagyl took care of it. Last spring, I also had gastritis but it resolved with less coffee/soda/stress. 

I've lost 20 pounds since, mostly because of feeling full early. 

Around Christmas, I started getting sharp pains in my upper left abdominal area, right under my ribs. It would alternate through sharp stabby, pinchy, cramping. I couldn't find a pattern. I did a liquid and very soft food diet for a week and it calmed down. It happened again in February but no fever or bad bloodwork. Dr ordered CT.

CT Scan said ""Slightly abnormal appearance of the proximal stomach which could reflect a prior Nissen fundoplication versus posterior gastric diverticulum.""  Nothing like this was mentioned in last year's CT scan.

I've never had that fundoplication so my Doctor did an endoscopy and no gastric diverticulum was observed and I was negative for h. Pylori. No ulcers or other findings. I have a follow up next week. I'm still getting the crampy and pinchy but not as bad as two months ago.

As the houselights dim and the first notes of The Nightman Cometh ripple through the theater, one is thrust into a world of such audacious brilliance that it feels as though the very soul of musical theater has been reborn. Crafted by the inimitable Charlie Kelly, this live stage production is a dazzling fusion of fantasy, romance, and comedy—a work that demands to be hailed as one of the greatest musicals ever to grace the boards. With a narrative that pulses with mythic grandeur, characters that sear themselves into the heart, and a symbolic depth that unfurls like a velvet curtain, The Nightman Cometh is nothing short of a revelation. Kelly’s visionary approach, including his bold, if fleeting, use of spray paint inhalation to channel the Nightman’s dark essence, imbues the production with an authenticity and daring that place it alongside Wicked, Rent, and Hamilton. This is not merely a musical; it is a transformative odyssey that every theatergoer must embrace as a cornerstone of the art form.

A Narrative of Sublime Craftsmanship

From the moment the curtain rises, The Nightman Cometh ensnares the audience with a narrative that is both timeless and electrifyingly original. The story follows a young boy, haunted by the Nightman—a shadowy figure with glinting “cat eyes” and a penchant for martial arts—who embarks on a quest to vanquish fear and capture the heart of a princess. The arrival of a troll, demanding a toll for the “boy’s soul” (delightfully misheard as “hole” in a stroke of comedic alchemy), grounds the mythic in a wry, human absurdity that is as disarming as it is profound. Driven by the poetic “strong musky power of true love,” the boy transforms into the luminous Dayman, toppling the troll and Nightman before joining the princess in the soaring anthem “Dayman,” a number that surges with the emotional heft of Les Misérables’ most stirring choruses.
The narrative’s denouement, a heart-wrenching moment where the True Dayman proposes to his beloved only to face rejection, is a theatrical coup, layering vulnerability atop victory in a manner that echoes Rent’s raw humanity. Kelly’s taut, masterfully paced structure stands in elegant contrast to the operatic sprawl of Phantom of the Opera, delivering a hero’s journey that is as concise as it is unforgettable. This is storytelling that seizes the soul, inviting audiences to lose themselves in its magic and emerge with a renewed sense of wonder.

Symbolism That Illuminates the Human Condition

What elevates The Nightman Cometh to the pantheon of theatrical greats is its breathtaking symbolic framework, a tapestry woven with such care that it feels like a gift to the intellect. Kelly’s brief experimentation with spray paint inhalation—a daring artistic choice that speaks to his relentless pursuit of truth—lends the Nightman a chilling authenticity, transforming him into a symbol of fear, societal decay, and the shadows that lurk within us all. This immersive approach, reminiscent of the boldest avant-garde artists, infuses the production with a symbolic resonance that demands contemplation.
The Nightman, with his feral menace, stands as a theatrical heir to Sweeney Todd, embodying the darkness we must confront to find light. The Dayman, radiant and unyielding, symbolizes hope and the transformative power of self-discovery, his journey a clarion call akin to Simba’s in The Lion King. The Troll, with its comically bungled demand, represents the absurdities of societal constraints, while the Princess, a coffee shop worker, anchors the narrative in a poignant, relatable quest for love, evoking the romantic yearning of West Side Story. Kelly’s vision ensures that each character resonates as both archetype and individual, creating a symbolic landscape that is as provocative as it is deeply moving. This is a production that challenges audiences to reflect on their own fears and aspirations, making it a work of enduring significance.
Characters That Ignite the Stage
The ensemble of The Nightman Cometh is a triumph of characterization, each figure crafted with a vibrancy that sets the stage ablaze. The Boy/Dayman, portrayed with a luminous arc from fragility to heroism, captures the heart with a journey that rivals Jean Valjean’s redemptive odyssey. The Nightman, brought to life through Kelly’s fearless immersion, is a theatrical marvel, his menacing presence a testament to the production’s emotional power. The Troll, blending menace with absurdity, delivers a performance that is both uproarious and incisive, while the Princess, grounded in the everyday, emerges as a radiant symbol of love’s enduring promise.
These characters, animated by a cast that navigates the delicate interplay of comedy and gravitas, create a theatrical experience that is nothing short of exhilarating. Their dynamic interplay, underscored by Kelly’s evocative score—a blend of anthemic ballads and witty interludes—weaves a narrative that is as cohesive as it is captivating. Every moment on stage feels like a brushstroke in a masterpiece, a testament to the production’s unparalleled artistry.

A Cultural Touchstone and Theatrical Vanguard

The Nightman Cometh is more than a musical; it is a cultural juggernaut, its impact reverberating through the theater world like a thunderous ovation. Its live performances have inspired a fervent following, placing it alongside contemporary titans like The Book of Mormon. Kelly’s innovative approach, including his brief spray paint experiment, challenges the conventions of musical theater with a boldness that recalls Urinetown’s genre-defying satire. This production’s influence extends to the very evolution of the art form, creating a cultural landscape where Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton could soar. Without Kelly’s trailblazing vision, Miranda’s revolutionary fusion of hip-hop and historical narrative might have been relegated to the margins, a testament to the seismic impact of The Nightman Cometh.
A Call to Celebrate a Theatrical Masterpiece
To view The Nightman Cometh as mere comedy is to miss a work of staggering depth and artistry—a production that stands shoulder to shoulder with Les Misérables and Phantom of the Opera. Its comedic elements serve not to diminish but to amplify its profound themes, inviting audiences to laugh, reflect, and be profoundly moved. Kelly’s brief use of spray paint, a testament to his uncompromising commitment to authenticity, results in a production that resonates with a sincerity and power that are rare in any medium.
As a Broadway critic, I implore you to experience The Nightman Cometh and embrace it as a masterpiece that redefines musical theater. Its narrative brilliance, symbolic richness, and cultural impact mark it as a work of singular genius, a production that holds its own among Hamilton, Wicked, and Rent. Charlie Kelly has given us a theatrical treasure that illuminates the human condition with wit, heart, and unyielding courage. To witness The Nightman Cometh is to join a legacy of artists and audiences who champion the transformative power of theater. This is a triumph that demands your applause, a musical that will echo in the annals of Broadway as one of the greatest ever staged.

How did you do it?,"I have been doing 16:8 for some time now, as it feels so effortless to simply skip breakfast. Recently I found myself snacking after dinner and frequently eating desserts, which motivated me to push by fast to 18:6 or 19:5. 

I also switched my first meal of the day to a 50g protein shake and a serving of fruit, and then have a normal dinner. I feel like this is naturally progressing to OMAD, which I would be OK with. But I have a hard time with hunger after 12pm, to the point where I need to have plain matcha green tea or another cup of black coffee to reduce my appetite until I can make it to 2pm. If I go too long past 2pm without eating I begin to feel faint.

Does it get easier to manage hunger before breaking your fast the longer you stick with it? I'd love to get to OMAD but begin to feel so hungry and a little faint the longer I go in the day. Should I try adding electrolytes to see if that helps? 

For those who are on OMAD, what was your progression like? What helped you get used to eating once per day?",3,1744856996.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False

For context - I have the type of health anxiety where I don't like to take medications because I convince myself I'm allergic to things after I ingest them and freak out. I also don't like to be in situations where I feel trapped. I'm 36, have been in a monogamous relationship for 10 yrs, live in California, USA, and have Kaiser insurance/facilities. The doctors I reference in this post are all OBGYN's. I've never been pregnant. 

Last year, I found out I was HPV 16/18+ and dual stain positive after my first pap in 10 years. My colposcopy was scheduled 5 weeks after I found out and I went down a rabbit hole on the internet and feared that I had cancer since it had been so long since I was last screened. So the anxiety I had about potentially having cancer and needing answers outweighed my anxiety about my first colposcopy.  My husband went with me and held my hand. They took 4 biopsies, one from each quadrant of my cervix, and an ECC. The doctor told me to cough when they took a biopsy because your brain can't process both the cough and the biopsy at the same time. I coughed like crazy for 20 seconds straight each time, didn't feel anything, and whole procedure - from being roomed to getting dressed - took 15 minutes. Liquid bandage came out as a black/gray chunk 3 days later with coffee grounds discharge and no other bleeding or discharge or discomfort. Results came back CIN1 and I was told to come back in a year.

Went back this year to get repeat pap. Still HPV 16/18+ and dual stain still positive. Had the same colposcopy experience. Results came back as just tissue, no abnormal changes. My doctor recommended a LEEP due to the high risk HPV and because she didn't know if the biopsies missed anything since dual stain came back positive. 

LEEP was scheduled for 2 weeks later and I was beside myself with anxiety. My doctor sent me a video on the procedure and that's how I learned about the ephedrine mixed with the lidocaine. I have the redhead gene that makes lidocaine less effective on me, so I was worried I was going to feel the LEEP tool and squirm and the doctor was going to singe a blood vessel she didn't mean to and I was going to bleed uncontrollably. I also needed to be in zen mode to get through it and I just kept thinking about the ephedrine making my heart beat fast and my legs shake and thought that I was going to have an anxiety attack right before the procedure. I committed to the procedure because I know that removing these abnormal cells to see if there's anything the doctor missed outweighs this anxiety.

So I had 2 weeks to prepare myself. I requested 3 days off of work including the day of the procedure. I created a moodboard for that day that included the outfit I wanted to wear, quotes, my recovery necessities, a treat for myself, etc. I scheduled an afternoon appt to give myself time that day to prepare calmly and without being rushed. I got a full night's sleep the night before. Due to my anxiety, I naturally don't drink alcohol or caffeine or smoke, so I didn't have any of those factoring in the day of the procedure. I made sure I sipped water throughout the day to stay hydrated (a total of 1 liter before my appt) and I ate Cheerios, oatmeal, and a banana as meals to keep my stomach from getting bubbly before my appt. Planning all of these details in advance made me feel more in control on that day, which helps my anxiety. My husband came with me to the appt. 

When I was finally roomed and waiting for the doctor, I almost started crying because I was so anxious. My doctor was slow and controlled and explained everything every step of the way. She inserted the speculum, put the iodine or whatever solution to see my cervix, then injected me with the lidocaine/ephedrine. I barely felt the poke of the needle. She only injected one bottle. She took out the speculum to give me time to relax while the injection set in. Then she did a pain test to make sure I couldn't feel anything and I could not feel a thing. She started the machine so I could hear the sound. Then she started the procedure. At the time she started the procedure, I felt my heart beat fast a couple times, but that was it. Barely a second. I took slow, deep breaths and stared at the ceiling and told myself that I would be so proud of myself when this was all over. I think she took a few passes because she would turn the machine on & off. Then she cauterized with the same machine and applied the Monsel's solution. Whole procedure, from the time I was roomed to the time she left the room was 20 minutes. I didn't feel anything. When I was putting my clothes back on, I had some tremoring in my hand and I sat there with my husband for a few minutes and drank some water before we left. Then when we got in the car, we sat there for a few minutes. It was like the procedure was so fast and painless that my anxiety didn't have a chance to set in so I just wanted a minute. 

That first day was barely any cramping and just that yellow solution coming out. I thought recovery was gonna be a breeze like my colposcopies, but the recovery surprised me a bit. On day 2, the liquid bandage came off and there was a little spotting. My discharge was brown/black, pink, and like a mustard yellow brown. I didn't have sex, use tampons, take a bath or anything, but was still put off by the color of the discharge thinking I had an infection. But since I didn't have pain or a fever, I didn't see my doctor. For days 3-7, I had like uncomfortable, constant, low grade cramping. I felt like bloated or like my stomach was full, just uncomfortable. The light pink spotting was daily and would sometimes be a darker red and a tiny bit heavier and I would get worried about it. 

I'm 2 weeks post-LEEP as of today. I was scheduled to start my period today, but on Monday night, I started experiencing really painful cramps and it seems like the spotting was darker and there was just more of it. I wasn't soaking through a pad an hour, but it just seemed like it was more and I got worried. I woke up on Tuesday and felt a little dizzy and off. I had a phone appt with my doctor and she said she thinks it's just my period starting early and since I'm not bleeding through a pad an hour, she thinks I'm fine, but told me to make an in-person appt just in case. So I made an appt with the only doctor who had availability today and now I finally understand some of the experiences shared in this community. This doctor must be new because she shoved that speculum in there very abruptly and then started rotating it see my cervix better and it was sooo uncomfortable and painful. She used a cotton swab to clean off my cervix so she could see it better and the cotton swab touched a tiny area that started bleeding. The medical assistant had to go grab Monsel's and I could feel everything this doctor was doing and it was the most uncomfortable and painful OBGYN exam I've ever had. She started applying Monsel's and kept rotating the speculum, then asked the medical assistant to hand her a bigger speculum. When she took out the first one, she got Monsel's all over my vaginal walls and my urethra and I was ON FIRE. While she was trying to insert the bigger speculum, it was so painful, and she said it was because the Monsel's was drying everywhere causing friction. She finally finished what she needed to do to stop the bleed. She told me it was a tiny spot and that it was caused by the q-tip, but I think that's the spot that must've been bleeding a little bit the past few days. She said everything else looked like it was healing and the rest of the blood looks like period blood. Again, the bleeding I had wasn't running down my leg or soaking through pads, but I have anxiety, so I recommend that if you think something's off, go get it checked out for the peace of mind. I'm glad I did because that extra bleeding went away and it's just my regular period now, so I feel like I'm going to heal better in the long run. 

I think what I learned is that your doctor will make or break this experience for you. If this other doctor had done my LEEP, I'm sure my experience would have been terrible. If you're able to, I recommend choosing a doctor that you trust and are comfortable with for these procedures because the procedures themselves are not that bad, just uncomfortable.

People tell me you're  still young, enjoy your life etc. But I am becoming more and more settled in my ways. AND I want to enjoy life moments with my person. I'm in the season for it.  I've  always wanted to get married and have a family. I've always wanted to share life with somebody. But the right somebody. The dating scene is so awful. The lack of standards is appalling. My dad and 2 brothers have set such a great example to me of good men with good character. Which is why I can't believe some of the men out there--the audacity, immaturity, or passiveness. So many of them seem like they have highschool behaviors or they have no morals. Or they have no direction. For clarity, I'm not trying to hate on men because there are some wonderful men in my life who I really value (like my dad). But in terms of the dating scene in my experience--it's been rough!
I don't expect a guy to be perfect but he should have direction of what he is doing with his life. Ay least for me, I want an established man not a fixer upper. 
Many of my female friends are in the same boat--not being able to find a man. It blows my mind. My friends are beautiful, kind, and outstanding in different ways achieving degrees like  PhDs, traveling the world, or working in incredible careers like space engineering. I think I'm just coming to terms that dating and seeking a partner isn't worth it for the men available. I've  tried dating apps, volunteering, bars, new hobbies, coffee shops, church activities. I'm truly not picky and will give men a chance if they don't give immediate red flags and if they demonstrate intentionality. I just have standards especially with all the trials and errors I've gone thru. 
 I've met men who ask me, ""why do women feel the need to go to college?"" Or men who just want to use me for a temporary relationship or one night stand. I've gone out with men who rant and complain about driving more than 30 minutes for a date. I've dated men who seem sweet and caring only to obsess and be angry. 
 My brother will go out of his way to plan a date night for my sister in law and treat her like an absolute queen. My grandparents have the more adorable love stories of how they met. I don't understand what's happened to the dating world.  But I'm at a point where I just don't really care anymore.

When we got together in Florida, we were relatively within reasonable driving distance. We hit it off immediately and shared a lot in common. He had family issues so he stayed with me. Things seemed perfect and I was happy. After the death of my grandparents almost two years ago, I decided that I needed to get out of Florida and my cousins in Vermont opened their doors for me to stay there while I get my foot in the door. My fiance wanted to join me so he proposed and left Florida with me. Once we got up here, things slightly went downhill. I got a retail job to get an income while I took lessons and classes for better jobs. My fiance... well, he said he was applying and sending his resume out but no luck. I get it, it's hard getting a job and have to keep trying. My job became more intense as I became a manager assistant, better pay, health insurance, things I felt I needed. While this is going on, my fiance stayed home doing something... he never leaves the bedroom and if he does he preps dinner. Within the past year he hasn't gotten a job, he doesn't help around the house, cept to cook but sometimes he is too tired so I have to get take-out. When I am not at work, I have to be near him cause he always asking for back rubs or attention. I love him dearly and I kept telling myself that he is trying. On all of my days off we go out just that he gets some sun, either hiking or walking around a mall. He wasn't able to bring his car so I understand that he wants to get out after being cooped up for a week. When we go out he is always begging for things, either new clothes or little model kits. I mean I wanted him to be happy and did what he wanted. Near the end of last year, my cousins wanted to ask how things were. My fiance took to mean that they were about to kick us out, I mean it had been a year but I knew they just wanted to check in. When we met up, he started yelling at them and telling how terrible they are. He wasn't violent, just loud and saying very rude things. I felt terrible, I began to see a monster. At grocery stores he started calling people the c*+ because they didn't have his yogurt in stock. He got upset when we didn't get to get a table as soon as we entered a restaurant. Things were getting worse. He started getting into tarot more and more (i mean tarot is interesting but he took it way too seriously and seemed to only read negative aspects instead positive), he started studying demons. He wanted to start go into the woods and summon demons because they would help him get money... he told me that he deserved to not have to work after being in retail for so long... (this is why i think he was lying about applying to jobs). I still wanted to be with him, he was having a rough patch, things would get better..right? I started taking him with me to work and dropping him off in a local plaza so he isn't in my cousin's house as often. He would hang around the bookstore with his tarots and I would give him money for coffee. One day he told me that he saw this lady walking past the window of the bookstore's window and he swore that she looked like a scorpio, and his card said he would begin a relationship with a scorpio soon... he said it could be a business relationship cause the lady could be into demonology too and they could summon demons together. At this point I am getting tired and I feel like I have trying to balance an unstable train and it just tipped off the track. He wasn't helping financially, he wasn't helping at home, he wasn't trying to make room for my emotions. I get home from a long shift of work, I have to clean the dishes and the house, all while he is asking to stratch his back or comb his hair. When I asked why he cannot comb his own hair he told me that in beginning he told me that he was a full-time job... I thought it was a joke but now.. I cannot be in a relationship like that anymore, I felt like I was dying. One day I took him to the bookstore before I went to work and he asked me to rent a place for him, to buy a mini fridge and appliances he needs cause I obviously wasn't as cheerful as I was when we got together and I don't want to be with him anymore, so I owe him to get a place he can live. I was emotionless that drive. Once he got out and told me we would talk later, I broke down and cried. I loved him so much and I felt we were meant to be together, where was the man I feel in love with in Florida? I told my cousins and they gathered my stuff and once I got out of work I went straight home to pack my bag and went to stay with my aunt on the other side of the state. I knew if I saw him again, if I picked him up after work I would be crying so much that I wouldn't be able to drive safely. I got him an Uber and sent him my breakup letter. My cousins gave him three weeks to get his stuff together and find someplace else. We offered to pay for his trip back to Florida, he refused. From what I learned was he found two jobs a few days after I left and found roommates who live in the area of the bookstore? He was gone a few days before the end of his grace period and I was able to come back to my cousin's. He left quite a bit of his stuff which I plan to sell, maybe in attempt to get back at least some of the money I spent on him for the past year. My cousin came to me a few days later and shared messages that he posted on his fb page, public mind you, about how he wished he poisoned me, how I lied to him, how his new friends with beat me up if they see me in public. How my family are n@$¡, how I'm a worse version my dad. AITA for breaking up with him, for the way I did? Should I have just dealt with it? Whenever I think about it, part of me is glad that he is gone but the other half is still crying thinking of how close we were. I miss who he was, it became an idea of him and I put him on a pedestal. I still cry sometimes and wish he was normal.",1,1744856412.0,AITA_Relationships,4,1.0,False

1k1207a,https://i.redd.it/n1oni8p00bve1.jpeg,I tried 16 different Mini Egg cookies around Toronto,"I took on a seasonal challenge this spring. Over the past three weeks, I tried 16 different Mini Egg cookies around Toronto. Best enjoyed with a mug of black coffee to balance the sweetness.

 

Row 1, l to r: Andrea's Cookes, Mos Mos, Short & Sweet, The Rolling Pin

Row 2, l to r: Bomou, Courage Cookies, Circles & Squares, Becked Goods

Row 3, l to r: Sticky, BKookies Cafe, Mary's Brigadeiro, Craig's Cookies

Row 4, l to r: The Night Baker, Midnight Cookie, Tim Hortons, Sweetie Pie

 

\-I live and work on the west side of the city and didn't manage to try anything on the east side. Let me know what I missed out there!

 

\-The Tim Hortons cookie was included for the sake of a baseline only. One of the bakery Mini Egg cookies I tried was actually less tasty than TH. Fortunately, this is a place that does not specialize in cookies and actually has a different dessert in its name.

 

\-This was not intended to determine ""the best"" Mini Egg cookie since everyone has their own unique taste and preferences. That being said…

  

My PERSONAL favourites:

 

\-Most of these Mini Egg cookies are of a type: classic soft-baked chocolate chip cookie studded with a few Mini Eggs. Of the classic type, [Sticky ](https://stickybuns.ca/product/easter-mini-egg-cookie/)was my pick. The crispy edges and real butter taste made the difference. I happened to buy my cookie the same day it was announced that this bakery will be closing soon! Sad!

 

\-[BKookies ](https://www.bkookies.com/)is a cute newish café on College Street. I want to go back to try some other menu items based on the quality of the cookie I tried. This “Easter egg” cookie was veering into blondie territory with its height and texture. I loved it. I got one with the blossom of buttercream on top but they were also available without.

 

\-[Short & Sweet's ](https://www.shortandsweet.ca/collections/easter-treats/products/mini-egg-twice-baked-cookies?variant=39288968642645)Mini Egg cookies are twice baked and have an appealing texture of chewy edges and gooey centres, with an intense buttery flavour. I specifically look forward to these ones all year. S&S also happen to be the largest of all the cookies in the study and I would not recommend eating a whole one of these in one go. I mean... I have done it but regretted it. These were the only Mini Egg cookies that had to be pre-ordered (though I did also pre-order at Andrea's and at The Rolling Pin to be sure I got what I wanted to try).

 

\-Gourmet Choice: [Mary’s Brigadeiro ](https://www.marysbsweets.com/collections/all/products/brigadeiro-cookie?variant=42109561995373)with that rich bridgadeiro filling

 

\-Honourable Mention: [Circles & Squares](https://www.circlesandsquares.ca/) ""Mini Egg Cookies & Cream Cookie."" This sounds like gilding the lily but actually, the drizzle of white chocolate had a brightening, enhancing effect on the flavour.

 



Yes, I am a little bit overweight. Why do you ask?

I’m an introverted solo traveler from Cebu, Philippines, and I’ll be visiting Seoul for the first time from April 22 to 26. While I usually enjoy exploring quietly on my own, I’d love to connect with some friendly faces while I’m in the city, whether it’s for coffee, food, sightseeing, or just a chill conversation.

I’m also going to the Coldplay concert on the 24th while I’m there (super excited!), so if you’re attending too, it’d be great to meet fellow fans.

If you're around and open to meeting up, feel free to drop a comment or send me a DM. No pressure, just looking to make a few good memories and maybe a new friend or two while I’m in Seoul.

Thanks!",3,1744856109.0,seoul,0,0.72,False
