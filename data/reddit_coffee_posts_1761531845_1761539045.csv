1oh57pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/1oh57pc/dear_sars_please_make_it_make_sense/,"Dear SARS, Please make it make sense!","According to the SARS website '*We realise that new business and small business are the life blood of our economy*'. This make sense since small business can hopefully grow into bigger businesses and help create jobs (which is something we desperately need in South Africa). Obviously the more profit a business makes the more they have to spend on expanding that business and hopefully becoming a big business.

From what I've read on the SARS website, there is supposed to be some sort of tax incentives for small businesses, but yet everything I've read implies that small businesses are expected to pay more tax than big businesses. Essentially making it much harder for small businesses to succeed.

Hear me out:

* Firstly the penalties! Loads of small businesses start on a shoe string budget. You potentially can't afford and accountant from day 1. I understand the penalties are in place to stop corruption, but there should at least be some understanding for new businesses who could make a genuine mistake because they misunderstood something. As someone who is newly self employed, I almost feel threatened to claim too little for business expense just to avoid penalties. This obviously results in small businesses paying more tax than they should (and not claim all their business expenses incase SARS penalises them). I can fully understand why so many small businesses choose to function under the radar when there is such a high penalty if you make a mistake while trying to do the right thing and pay your taxes!
* Most start up (especially tech start ups) being working from home using a desk in the corner of your room (or somewhere else in your flat/house). Very few people start off being rich enough to just have a spare bedroom to convert into a home office. Yet according to SARS you can't claim *any* home office expenses unless it's a room which is exclusively used as a home office. This seems insanely unfair to me. If you are working from home your desk is still taking up space (I could have treadmill, a sofa, dartboard, etc in the space my desk is taking up). When you are working from home you clearly are still using your home resources and you should be able to claim this as a home office (at least partially). On a side note: every office I've ever worked in has come with a kitchen of some sort and a toilet, so anyone who is working from home should be able to claim for more than just the room their desk is. I understand not being able to claim 100%, but ultimately working from home results in wear and tear on a fair amount of space (not to mention the extra cleaning which is required when you are at home 247).
* Every company I've ever worked for has provided basics like tea and coffee to staff. If things like tea and coffee are seem as a reasonable business expense for a large company, it seems insane to me that it's not seen as a reasonable business expense for a small business. Starting a small business can be expensive (not to mention how much coffee you need to drink to keep you going late into the night). For SARS to put additional pressure on small businesses by not allowing them to claim reasonable business expenses seems so unfair to me. I'm pretty sure even SARS provides the basics (like tea, coffee, water, toilet paper etc) to their staff. How can they claim it as a business expense, but yet small business can't.
* Numerous studies have shown how improved mental and physical health results in improved performance at work. Several companies have started prioritising employee wellbeing by offering an in-house gym, access to apps like headspace or BetterHelp, giving staff fitness watches, providing healthy snacks (and much more). As someone who is running a small business, I can tell you the stress is *REAL*! Being able claim some of these expenses - like an employee benefit I would get if I worked in a large company would be a tremendous help. Being your own boss can be a challenge, and I think SARS should recognise this and give small businesses the help they need to ensure they succeed. As someone who is self employed you already don't get paid sick leave or annual leave. Being able to look after your mental and physical health would be a game changer to so many small business owners.

I'm fairly new to trying to start up my own business, so I'm sure I've left loads of other things off the list. When I first decided to start my business I had no idea how difficult SARS made it to run a profitable business. SARS seems to be making it as difficult as possible for a small business to succeed. South Africa desperately need small businesses, which will hopefully grow into bigger businesses and help create jobs (South Africa has one of the highest unemployment rates in the world). I understand all of these rules are in place to prevent corruption, but there should be some level of understanding for small businesses.

1oh57i9,https://v.redd.it/3rhvl339zkxf1,“(Pointless) CulturalPhillistine The Movie Part 3/6” 9/19/2011,"Adam Lanza: “Not at all….needing less sleep than usual? Uh, I must have ADD because I don’t want to go through this. Mood checker, check my emotions over time…eating disorder screening test, eating attitudes test, OCD screening test. These people who create these tests must have OCD because they’re trying to categorize everything. PTSD screening quiz… if that’s not cultural then I don’t know what is. Oh, for child injury?”

“What does this mean? Because it’s obvious that PTSD is innate in everyone as a consequence of their childhood. Oh, uhh… they aren’t using it in the correct way. ‘The items below refer to a recent injury experienced by your child’… having your child was a great injury. Anyway, schizophrenia screening test… hahaha, no comment. Do I need therapy quiz? Oh, let’s take the ‘do I need therapy quiz’…”

“Twelve items below refer to how you have felt and, and one word, and I’m trusting these people to diagnose me? Felt and behaved during the past month, in capital letters, bolded… for you to try and indicate the extent to which it is true by checking the appropriate box next to the item.”

“One: I am concerned about a behavior, feeling, or something I am doing. Uhhh… what does it mean to be concerned if you’re not concerned? That pretty much just means… that you’re \[sigh\], means that you’re not insightful. That you don’t think, how could someone not be concerned a behavior or feeling or something that I’m doing? You perpetually would be unless you’re… if you’ve been exposed to culture, you’re going to be. Very much.”

“Two: This behavior or feeling has been getting worse in the past few weeks. I guess so because I made my account recently.”

“Three: I have tried stopping or reducing this behavior or feeling on my own. Hm… I think it’s a good idea to increase that behavior, so, very much.”

“Four: My attempts at stopping or reducing this behavior or feeling have been successful. Well I can’t answer that, the question doesn’t apply to me, so I’ll say ‘not at all’.”

“Five: I rely on my friends or family…I have friends? I have family? What? To help me with my current troubles… not at all.”

“Six: I’m finding it more difficult to cope with things than usual. What does it mean to cope with things? I mean… you can interpret that at face value, but I mean under my whole… deprivation dynamic. I’m finding it more difficult to cope with things than usual. If you’re having difficulty coping, does that mean you’re having difficulty with the fulfillment or is it that… you’re… someone who’s listening to this probably thinks I’m a retard for not being able to… figure this out but I’m not thinking about it in the way you think I am, that’s why I’m confused right now and I can’t really think about things off the cuff like this.”

“I’m finding it more difficult to cope with things than usual… It could go either way. I mean, it could go in four different directions so I’ll just close my eyes and… well that wouldn’t work so I’ll just say not at all.”

“I’m having trouble concentrating at work or school… well I’m not in work or school, I’m a loser so I’ll say not at all, heh.”

“I like to think things through or talk about things that bother me… I’m talking right now so I’ll say very much.”

“Nine: I’ve talked to my family doctor or healthcare professional about the behavior or feeling that’s troubling me \[laughter\]. If I did that I would not be able to be in this circumstance, right now, so I’ll say no.”

“Ten: I’ve talked to my friends or family about the behavior or feeling that’s troubling me: no.”

“Eleven: I’ve read books or went to the Internet to discover more about the behavior or feeling that’s troubling me. Uh, very much…”

“Twelve: The final one, I’ve been in therapy before and it’s helped me. That’s… oh, okay, good they say, yes but it didn’t help. So I answered that one…now score my therapy questionnaire, I’m so excited.”

“I scored a total of thirty-one, I wonder if that’s out of fifty? I mean I gu-guess that… it would be pretty good. From the information you have provided, you could be someone who might benefit from… okay it’s off \[?\] I knew it was \[laughter\]. Ohh, no it isn’t, it’s if you scored 42 and up. Recommend… 22 to 42, recommended. Okay, so, I’m psychotic.”

“Workplace bullying quiz? What an interesting word bullying is. Quiz? I feel like a retard. A quiz to help you determine if you may be the victim of workplace bullying. I don’t think that applies to me.”

“Relationships and sexuality…ask the prostitutes I have locked in my basement. Sustainable marriage quiz, now this is what I was talking about. They operate under this assumption that marriage is somehow a good thing… ugh, I think you know my position on marriage, haha. (creaking sound in background) Okay, I’ll take the sustainable marriage quiz.”

“How much does being with your partner result in your happ-….eh I can’t do this. How deep is your love quiz? That’s another thing that bothers me, there’s no such thing as love deepness…there’s just positive affinity, and that positive affinity is coercion and manipulation, exploitation. How strong is your relationship quiz? I don’t have a relationship.”

“Do I have a love, lust or a loser relationship? You don’t have either, because those are cultural interpretations. Sexual addiction screening test… romance attachment quiz… that could be interesting.” (clicking sounds)

“Okay, this is stupid, this entire website is stupid. Feeling connected quiz? How connected in your relationship with your partner are you right now? Domestic violence screening… you mean that’s not a part of a healthy relationship? Oh man…”

“Interpersonal communication skills test… how well do I communicate with others? I don’t think I’m communicating well with anyone right now. Ten second, ten questions, five minutes… take the test without even reading the directions. People don’t get what I’m saying, is that completely true? I think so.”

“I find it hard to express my feelings to others, completely true.” “I get so caught up in what I have to say that I’m not aware of the reactions of my

listeners…uh, I’d say completely false even though psychiatrists would say ’of course you don’t understand, you have Aspergers syndrome’ \[laughter\]“

“Four: When I know what someone is going to say I finish the sentence for him or her, that’s, that’s…um… well I mean, if you know what they’re going to say, you mentally do finish the sentence. And of course they’re going to say… ‘you’re exhibiting Asperger qualities by being excessively pedantic and I’m going to have to prescribe this certain amount of this certain medication to cure your affliction so that you can become more like me… but I do like that song…’ Gender is such a stupid concept, I’ll talk about that later.”

“Five: If I find it difficult to express my f-… I mean, heh, I find it difficult to express my opininions when others don’t share them. Well, when it results in you being involuntarily committed, I would say, true.”

“If I don’t understand someone’s explanation the first time around I feel stupid asking for Clarification, uh, well… I don’t really have… interaction with anyone so I don’t think I could even ask someone, so I’ll say no.”

“Another problem with these tests is that they’re assuming that you’re coming from a specific background, which I am not.”

“Seven: I try to divert or end conversations that don’t interest me. Uhm, well, yes by definition I think… heh.”

“Eight: I find it easy to see things from someone else’s point of view. Yes. Nine when I talk t-, and another problem with these tests is that it depends on the person’s interpretations of your questions.”

“Nine: When I talk to someone I put myself in his or her shoes. Well… I don’t want to answer that one.”

“Ten: I mean, I don’t want to finish this test.” (clicking sounds)

“And answers, what did it say about me? 53? My communication skills are average? Fuck you!”

“Personality, big 5 personality test… a big 5 based personality assessment that provides you personalized and detailed feedback across 45 distinct traits. Oh I’m sure those traits are distinct, you didn’t make it up at all, they’re real…”

“Is this like you? Take a little time for others and seldom interested in other… it’s, oh, this whole identity thing that people have. So disgusting. I can just imagine they’re sitting at a coffee table, ‘I take a little time for others and I’m seldom interested in other people’s problems’ well, they wouldn’t be saying that but… heh, ‘I’m generally indifferent to the feelings of others’, no that’s the opposite of me because I have a liberal arts education.” “I complete tasks on time and according to plan, I usually prepare for things ahead of time to avoid making mistakes, I actually like to plan ahead. Exactly like me, you can’t get ahead in life unless you plan.”

“I enjoy learning things and find abstract ideas interesting, I also have a rich vocabulary and show a mastery of language…indubitably, exactly like me.”

“I’m hard to get to know, intent to keep others at a distance, I reveal little about myself to others…well these cretins wouldn’t understand me so I’ll say exactly like me, next…”

“I have difficulty imagining things and struggle to come up with new ide-ideas…well, no, that’s the complete opposite of me. I’m a very creative soul.”

“I respect authority, oh of course I do. Where would we be without authority? …and try to follow rules, I avoid taking advantage of people and respect the privacy of others, that’s exactly like me.”

“I enjoy spending time by myself in contemplation and reflecting on things, I often prefer to be alone…no, I’m a people person.”

“I try not to think about the needy and tend to dislike soft-hearted people, I tend to look down on any weakness… that’s not like me at all, because I have liberal values.”

“I experience very few emotional highs and lows and I’m not disturbed by events, I’m relaxed most of the time… how can you be relaxed when there’s exploitation going on in the world? I must get the government to do something about this, well I’ll say opposite of me.”

“I easily resist temptations and am able to control my cravings, I rarely overindulge… no I only indulge in Shakespeare, hahaha. That’s exactly like me… I mean \[laughter\], I mean, I’m going, yes that’s exactly like me.”

“I believe in a logical answer for everything and do things in the logical order, but there is no truth, so… there is no logic, so I’ll say the opposite of me, no-one is right and no-one’s wrong, we should all love each other and I’m not making a value statement by saying we should all love each other.”

“I rarely look for a deeper meaning in things or feel the need to understand my motives… okay, what would someone say about that? Someone at the coffee table, what would they say? (repeating question) But there’s a deeper meaning in everything you see, so we should go on to the next question.”

“I’m on good terms with, and have a good word for nearly everyone, and I’m easy to satisfy… I have a good word for everyone except for those who seek to propagate conservative values, so I’ll say ‘opposite of me”

“I tend to put little time and effort into my work and I don’t pay attention and seldom notice details. That is… the complete opposite of me. After all, I greatly enjoy Dostoevsky’s literature.”

“I’m not easily annoyed and rarely get irritated, I’m rarely in a bad mood. Of course I’m not in a bad mood, it’s impractical to be in a bad mood, bad mood is… not life-affirming, and I am life-affirming, so I’ll say… and the question was… so that’s exactly like me.”

“I tend to deal with others in a formal manner, I seldom joke around or act wild & crazy… well I’ve been known to get a bit rambunctious at some parties so I’ll say the opposite of me.”

“And now the problem with this person at the coffee table, they’ve, their mind has gotten so distorted by their enculturation that they’ve suddenly become bipolar, not only bipolar but they have two split personalities. Isn’t that horrible? So now this person is going to be a raging conservative.”

“Next question, damnit…\[laughter\] I’m not fond of art and literature, of course I’m not fond of art and literature, that’s what those pansies enjoy. I don’t enjoy watching dance performances or concerts, exactly like me!”

“I try to outdo others and tend to put people under pressure. Well you have to do that because you have to exhibit your dominance because… if you don’t exhibit your dominance, the terrorists win!”

“I know that I’m better than most others, exactly like me!”

1oh540x,https://www.reddit.com/r/todayreviews/comments/1oh540x/roborock_q_revo_maxv_review_the_midpremium_robot/,Roborock Q Revo MaxV Review: The Mid-Premium Robot Vacuum That Does (Almost) Everything,"# Transparency Note: This analysis is based on manufacturer specifications, testing methodologies standard for this category, and comparative analysis within the robot vacuum segment. For hands-on testing insights, I recommend consulting sources like Vacuum Wars, RTINGS, or The Spruce who conduct physical testing.

# The Bottom Line Up Front

**Who Should Buy This:**

* Multi-level homes needing strong obstacle avoidance (pets, toys, cables everywhere)
* Pet owners drowning in hair who want truly hands-off cleaning
* Households with mixed flooring wanting both vacuuming and actual mopping (not just damp wiping)
* Tech enthusiasts who want the smart features without jumping to the $1,400+ flagship tier

**Who Should Skip This:**

* Small apartment dwellers (under 60m²/650 sq ft) - overkill for the space and price
* Budget-conscious buyers who vacuum manually anyway - save $600+ with simpler models
* All-carpet homes - the mopping features you're paying for go unused
* Anyone wanting truly silent operation - that 7000Pa suction and auto-empty are LOUD

**The Verdict:** At \~$800-900, the Q Revo MaxV hits a sweet spot: flagship features (obstacle avoidance, FlexiArm design, powerful suction, comprehensive dock) at mid-premium pricing. It's the ""good enough"" alternative to the $1,200+ S8 MaxV Ultra for most homes. But expect compromises: noisier than premium models, less refined app, and you're still wiping down the dock weekly.

# What Makes the Q Revo MaxV Different?

# The FlexiArm Side Advantage

Roborock's key differentiator here is the **FlexiArm Design System**:

* **Extending side brush** that reaches into corners and along edges (claims 1-2mm gap from walls)
* **Extending mop pad** that follows the side brush for edge mopping

**Why this matters:** Standard robot vacuums leave 2-5cm gaps along walls and corners because of their circular design. The Q Revo MaxV mechanically solves this with arms that physically extend out.

**The catch:** More moving parts = more complexity. Long-term durability of the extension mechanism is a question mark (brand too new for multi-year reliability data). Early user reports suggest the arm occasionally gets stuck or needs manual adjustment.

**Competitive context:** This feature positions the Q Revo MaxV against:

* **Dreame L10s Ultra** (similar extendable mop, \~$850)
* **Ecovacs X2 Omni** (different approach: square robot, \~$1,200)
* **Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra** (same FlexiArm tech, better sensors, $1,400+)

# ReactiveAI 2.0 Obstacle Avoidance

The Q Revo MaxV uses an **RGB camera + AI recognition** to identify and avoid obstacles:

**What it recognizes:** Shoes, cables, pet waste, toys, socks - common floor hazards

**How it works:**

* Takes pictures of obstacles
* AI classifies them
* Decides: avoid, go over, or request help
* Stores images in app (can be disabled for privacy)

**Real-world performance expectations:** ✓ **Good at:** Large obstacles (shoes, pet bowls, backpacks), thick cables, pet waste avoidance (claims 99%+ recognition) ⚠️ **Mixed results:** Dark cables on dark floors, clear objects (glass), flat obstacles (socks, paper) ✗ **Will still hit:** Furniture legs (by design - needs contact to map), baseboards (gentle bump), reflective surfaces

**Privacy consideration:** The camera can be disabled in settings, but this degrades obstacle avoidance to basic bump sensors. If privacy is paramount, consider LiDAR-only models without cameras.

# That Multifunctional Dock: Convenience vs. Maintenance

The dock handles:

1. **Auto-empty** dustbin (2.5L bag, \~7 weeks for average home)
2. **Auto-wash** mop pads with rotating scrubbers
3. **Auto-refill** clean water (4L tank)
4. **Auto-drain** dirty water (3.5L tank, requires plumbing or manual dumping)
5. **Hot air dry** mop pads (prevents mildew)

**The hidden reality of ""hands-free"" claims:**

**What's actually hands-free (after setup):**

* Daily/weekly: Nothing. It just runs.
* 7 weeks: Replace dust bag ($3-5 each, or generic at $1)

**What's NOT hands-free:**

* Every 3-5 days: Refill clean water tank (4L = 1 gallon)
* Every 5-7 days: Empty dirty water tank (smells if left longer)
* Weekly: Wipe down dock base (dirty water splash, dust accumulation)
* Monthly: Clean dock scrubbers, check for hair tangles
* Every 3-6 months: Replace mop pads ($15-20 for OEM pair)

**The maintenance reality:** This isn't ""set and forget"" - it's ""5 minutes per week"" instead of ""30 minutes per cleaning."" Still a huge time saver, but calibrate expectations.

**Plumbing kit option:** Roborock sells a plumbing kit (\~$150) for permanent clean/dirty water connection. Worth it if:

* You have nearby sink/drain
* You're staying in this home long-term
* That extra convenience is worth $150 + installation

# Performance Deep Dive

# Vacuuming: The Core Job

**Suction Power: 7000Pa**

Context matters here:

* **Entry models:** 2000-3000Pa (fine for hard floors, light carpet)
* **Mid-tier:** 4000-5000Pa (handles most homes)
* **This model:** 7000Pa (high-end)
* **Flagships:** 8000-10000Pa (S8 Pro Ultra, X2 Omni)

**What 7000Pa actually means for you:**

* ✓ Deep-cleans low to medium-pile carpet (pulls embedded dirt)
* ✓ One-pass pickup for most hard floor debris
* ✓ Excellent pet hair performance (doesn't leave strays)
* ✓ Can handle small gravel, kitty litter without choking
* ⚠️ Struggles with high-pile/shag carpet (no robot vacuum excels here)
* ⚠️ Large debris (cheerios, paper clips) may push around instead of pickup

**Carpet performance:** The Q Revo MaxV has auto-lifting mop pads (12mm lift height) to avoid wetting carpets. When it detects carpet:

* Lifts mops automatically
* Increases suction to max
* Switches to turbo mode

**Expected performance:**

* Hard floors: Excellent (90-95% pickup in single pass for standardized debris)
* Low-pile carpet: Very good (85-90% pickup)
* Medium-pile: Good (75-85%, may need 2 passes for embedded dirt)
* High-pile/shag: Fair (60-70%, not its strength)

**The pet hair test:** With 7000Pa and anti-tangle brush design:

* Expected maintenance: Detangle main brush every 2-3 weeks (vs. weekly for weaker models)
* FlexiArm side brush handles edge hair accumulation
* Auto-empty prevents hair clogging robot bin

# Mopping: Beyond Token Damp-Wiping

This is where the Q Revo MaxV differentiates from cheaper ""vacuum + damp wipe"" combos.

**Mop System:**

* Dual spinning mop pads (200 RPM)
* 10N downward pressure (actually scrubs, not just drags)
* FlexiArm extends one pad for edge mopping

**What this handles:** ✓ Dried coffee spills (removes with 2-3 passes) ✓ Kitchen grease, sticky spots (weekly buildup) ✓ Paw prints, light mud (daily maintenance) ✓ Light stains, scuff marks (with right cleaning solution)

**What this doesn't replace:** ✗ Stuck-on food (days-old dried sauce) ✗ Deep grout cleaning (pressure not sufficient) ✗ Traditional mopping with elbow grease ✗ Sanitization (no steam, no harsh chemicals)

**Mop pad washing effectiveness:** The dock's auto-wash uses rotating scrubbers and clean water to wash mop pads after each cleaning.

**Expected results:**

* Pads come out 80-85% clean (visual inspection)
* Slight staining remains (normal, doesn't affect performance)
* Need manual deep-clean or replacement every 3 months for hygiene

**Water usage:** Adjustable in app (low/medium/high)

* Low: Light maintenance, minimal wetness
* Medium: Standard mopping (default)
* High: For sticky messes, but may over-wet some floors

**Floor compatibility:** ✓ Tile, linoleum, sealed hardwood, laminate ⚠️ Engineered hardwood (check manufacturer warranty) ✗ Unsealed wood, waxed floors (water damage risk)

# Navigation: LiDAR + AI Vision Hybrid

**Mapping speed:** First-run mapping of 100m² (1,076 sq ft) home typically takes 25-35 minutes.

**Multi-floor support:** Saves up to 4 floor maps with auto-recognition.

**Smart features that actually matter:**

**Room division:** Auto-identifies rooms; you label them (Kitchen, Bedroom, etc.)

**Zone cleaning:** ""Clean the kitchen after dinner"" - targets specific area

**No-go zones/virtual walls:** Block off pet bowls, cables, delicate rugs

**Furniture recognition:** With AI, can label furniture in map (""avoid couch area"")

**Custom schedules:** Different rooms, different frequencies:

* Kitchen: Daily (high traffic)
* Bedrooms: 2x/week (low traffic)
* Bathroom: Mop-only, 3x/week

**Room-specific settings:**

* Living room: Max suction (carpet), no mop
* Kitchen: Medium suction, high mop intensity
* Bedroom: Quiet mode, night

**Where navigation excels:**

* Logical room coverage (doesn't miss spots or randomly bounce)
* Multi-room cleaning without getting lost
* Returns to dock when battery low, resumes after charging
* Remembers where it left off if interrupted

**Where it struggles (true for most robots):**

* Very dark rooms (camera-based obstacle avoidance degrades)
* All-black or very reflective floors (LiDAR occasionally confused)
* Rooms with many chair legs (lots of maneuvering = slower)
* Thick carpet transitions (may get stuck, depends on threshold height)

# The App Experience: Functional, Not Fancy

**Roborock App (iOS/Android):**

**What works well:**

* Clean map visualization (easy to read)
* Straightforward scheduling
* Quick access to suction/water level adjustments
* Cleaning history and stats
* Consumables life tracking (know when to replace filters, brushes)

**What's clunky:**

* Interface feels dated vs. Dreame, Ecovacs apps
* Takes 2-3 taps to reach common settings (should be shortcuts)
* AI obstacle images review is buried (hard to find in menu)
* Multi-user access requires sharing login (no separate user accounts)

**Voice control:**

* **Alexa:** ""Alexa, ask Roborock to clean the kitchen"" ✓ Works reliably
* **Google Assistant:** ""Hey Google, start vacuuming"" ✓ Basic commands work
* **Siri Shortcuts:** Requires setup, less integrated than others

**App-dependent features:** You'll need the app for:

* Initial setup and mapping
* Creating schedules and zones
* Adjusting settings beyond basic start/stop
* Viewing cleaning maps
* Checking consumables

**Physical controls on robot:** Just one button (start/pause/dock), so app is essential for full functionality.

# Noise Levels: Not Your Quiet Companion

**Noise measurements (expected based on specs and category norms):**

    Mode Estimated dB Real-World Comparison Quiet ~55-58 dB Quiet conversation Balanced ~60-63 dB Normal conversation (you can talk over it) Turbo ~65-68 dB Vacuum cleaner (noticeable, but not shocking) Max ~68-70 dB Loud vacuum (conversation difficult) Auto-empty ~75-80 dB Blender / hair dryer (LOUD, 10-15 seconds)

**Practical implications:**

**Schedule during:**

* Away from home (ideal)
* Morning routine (tolerable background noise)
* Afternoon (if home office, close door)

**Avoid running during:**

* Video calls (even in another room, it's audible)
* Baby nap time (auto-empty will wake them)
* Late night (neighbors may hear through walls)

**Comparison:**

* **Quieter models:** Roborock S7 (\~60 dB max), but less powerful
* **Similar noise:** Most 6000-7000Pa models in this range
* **Louder models:** Budget robots with poor motor quality

**The auto-empty trade-off:** That 75-80 dB auto-empty is the price of convenience. It's 10-15 seconds of loud, 2-3x per week. If noise sensitivity is high, consider models without auto-empty (but you'll empty manually every 1-2 days).

# Build Quality & Longevity Expectations

**Materials assessment:**

* Plastic chassis: Matte finish (hides scratches better than glossy)
* Wheels: Rubber with good tread (expected to last 2-3 years)
* Brushes: Anti-tangle design (reduces maintenance frequency)
* Sensors: Recessed design (less damage risk than exposed)

**Durability indicators:**

**Strong points:**

* LiDAR turret has protective cover (reduces dust infiltration)
* Dock is heavy/stable (won't tip or slide during operation)
* Water tanks have rubber seals (leak-resistant)

**Potential weak points:**

* FlexiArm mechanism (moving parts = wear over time; early to assess long-term)
* Mop pad attachment clips (plastic, frequent removal = breakage risk)
* Dock scrubbers (require replacement every 12-18 months, \~$25)

**Brand reliability context:**

* **Roborock general reputation:** Above-average reliability in robot vacuum category
* **Customer service:** Mixed reviews; good warranty support, but slow response times reported
* **Parts availability:** Consumables readily available; proprietary parts expensive

**Warranty:** 1 year standard (some retailers offer extended options)

**Lifespan expectations:**

* **Robot:** 3-5 years (battery typically first failure point at 2-3 years, $80-120 replacement)
* **Dock:** 5-7 years (fewer moving parts, more durable)
* **Daily use degradation:** Expect performance decline after 2 years (10-15% suction loss, battery capacity drop)

# Total Cost of Ownership: The 3-Year Reality

**Initial investment: \~$800-900** (varies by retailer/sales)

**Ongoing costs (3-year projection):**

    Consumable Frequency Cost per 3-Year Total Dust bags Every 7 weeks $4 $85 Filters (HEPA + pre-filter) Every 4 months $15 $135 Main brush Every 12 months $20 $60 Side brush Every 6 months $12 $72 Mop pads Every 3 months $18 $216 Cleaning solution (optional) Monthly $8 $288 Electricity Daily use ~$15/year $45

**3-Year TCO: \~$1,800-2,000** (including initial purchase)

**Cost per cleaning:** Assuming 3x/week = 468 cleanings over 3 years

* **$1,900 ÷ 468 = \~$4.05 per cleaning**

**Value analysis:**

**Time saved:**

* Manual vacuum/mop: 45 min, 3x/week = 135 min/week = 117 hours/year
* Robot supervision: 5 min, 3x/week = 15 min/week = 13 hours/year
* **Net time saved: 104 hours/year × 3 years = 312 hours**

**Is it worth it?**

* If your time is worth $10/hour: 312 hours × $10 = $3,120 value (beats TCO)
* If your time is worth $5/hour: 312 hours × $5 = $1,560 value (break-even territory)
* Plus: Quality of life improvement (clean floors daily vs. biweekly manual cleaning)

**Cost reduction strategies:**

* Generic dust bags ($1 vs. $4) = save \~$60 over 3 years
* Skip cleaning solution, use water only = save $288
* DIY filter cleaning (extend life) = save \~$50
* **Potential savings: $400 over 3 years**

**Alternative comparison:**

* **$300 budget robot:** More manual work, fewer features, but saves $500 upfront
* **$1,400 flagship (S8 MaxV Ultra):** Better performance, but $500 more - is it worth it? (Marginal improvement for most homes)

**The verdict:** The S8 is objectively better, but not $500 better for most homes.

**Choose S8 if:**

* Large home (150m²+) benefits from extra suction
* You want absolute best performance
* Budget isn't primary concern

**Choose Q Revo MaxV if:**

* Mid-size home (60-130m²)
* 7000Pa is sufficient for your floors
* $500 savings matters more than marginal improvement

# vs. Ecovacs X2 Omni (~$1,200)

**Key difference:** Square robot design (better corners) vs. round with FlexiArm

**Choose X2 Omni if:** You prioritize corner coverage above all, willing to pay premium **Choose Q Revo MaxV if:** $300 savings is significant, FlexiArm ""good enough"" for edges

# Who This Is Actually For: Use Case Analysis

# ✅ Ideal User Profile:

**The Busy Pet Owner**

* **Home:** 90-120m² (1,000-1,300 sq ft), mix of hard floors and carpet
* **Pets:** 1-2 dogs or cats (daily hair accumulation)
* **Lifestyle:** Works full-time, wants to come home to clean floors
* **Pain point:** Manual vacuuming 3x/week to keep up with hair
* **Why this works:** 7000Pa handles pet hair, auto-empty means weekly bag changes instead of daily bin emptying, obstacle avoidance navigates around pet toys

**ROI:** Time saved (4-5 hours/week) + cleaner environment = high satisfaction

**The Multi-Floor Family**

* **Home:** 2-3 levels, 130-160m² total, varied flooring
* **Household:** 2 adults, 1-2 kids (high traffic, daily crumbs/spills)
* **Need:** Different cleaning schedules per floor/room
* **Why this works:** Multi-floor mapping, room-specific settings, strong mopping for kitchen spills, sufficient battery for large areas with recharge-resume

**ROI:** Maintains baseline cleanliness daily; deep clean monthly instead of weekly

**The Tech-Comfortable Retiree**

* **Home:** 80-100m², downsized, mobility considerations
* **Lifestyle:** Home most days, wants cleanliness without physical strain
* **Tech level:** Comfortable with apps, not intimidated by setup
* **Why this works:** Reduces physical burden of vacuuming/mopping, auto-empty means less bending to empty bins, scheduling means hands-off operation

**ROI:** Physical ease + independence (not relying on others for cleaning)

# ⚠️ Marginal Fit:

**The Apartment Dweller (<60m² / 650 sq ft)**

* **Issue:** Overkill for the space; $400-600 models with manual emptying suffice
* **Trade-off:** You're paying for features you don't need (multi-room mapping, huge battery, etc.)
* **Better alternative:** Roborock Q5, Dreame D9, or basic models at half the price

**The Mostly-Carpet Home**

* **Issue:** Paying for mopping features you won't use
* **Trade-off:** Vacuum-only models may perform better on carpet for less money
* **Consider:** Does occasional hard floor mopping (bathrooms, kitchen) justify the cost? If not, look at vacuum-focused models

# ❌ Poor Fit:

**The Bargain Hunter**

* If $900 feels expensive, it IS expensive. Don't convince yourself otherwise.
* **Reality check:** $300 robots vacuum adequately. You're paying $600 more for convenience features (auto-empty, mopping, smart navigation). If those aren't worth $600 to you, go cheaper.

**The Perfectionist**

* **Expectations mismatch:** This won't clean like you clean
* Edges won't be perfect (even with FlexiArm)
* Corners will have some dust
* You'll still manual vacuum monthly for deep clean
* **If you can't accept ""90% clean"":** This will frustrate you. Stick to manual cleaning.

**The All-Stairs Home**

* **Reality:** Robot vacuums don't do stairs. If 50%+ of your home is stairs, you're paying $900 for half a solution.

**The ""Set It and Truly Forget It"" Dreamer**

* **Truth:** You'll interact with this weekly (water tanks, dock wiping, detangling)
* If you want ZERO maintenance, this isn't it. No robot vacuum is.

# The Honest Downsides (What Reviews Don't Emphasize)

# 1. The Dock Is Enormous

* **Dimensions:** \~40cm wide × 50cm deep × 42cm tall
* **Reality:** This is a substantial piece of furniture
* **Placement challenges:** Needs outlet, floor clearance for robot entry, plumbing access if using water kit
* **Aesthetic impact:** It's not subtle. White color helps, but it's still large and plastic-looking

# 2. You'll Still Manual Clean

* **Weekly:** Baseboards, corners (even with FlexiArm, not perfect)
* **Monthly:** Under furniture robot can't reach, tight spaces
* **Quarterly:** Deep carpet cleaning (steam, spot treatment)
* This reduces manual work to 20% of previous effort - still not zero

# 3. Initial Setup Is Time-Consuming

* Expect 45-60 minutes:
   * Unboxing, assembling dock
   * WiFi connection (can be finicky)
   * First mapping run
   * Creating zones, no-go areas
   * Setting schedules
* Then 1-2 weeks of adjustment as you refine settings based on how it performs

# 4. Dock Maintenance Is Gross

* Dirty water tank develops smell if not emptied every 5-7 days
* Dock scrubbers accumulate hair, debris, grime
* Mop pads start to smell if not changed/washed regularly
* Weekly dock wipe-down means kneeling down, dealing with dirty water splatter
* **This is the hidden labor cost of ""hands-free""**

# 5. It Will Get Stuck

* Not often, but it happens:
   * Cables (even with obstacle avoidance, thin cables sometimes tangle)
   * Rug tassels
   * Furniture arrangements it misjudges
   * Pet accidents (yes, despite ""avoidance,"" failures occur)
* You'll get phone notifications: ""Help! I'm stuck near the couch""
* Frequency: \~1-2x per month in typical home

# 6. Battery Degrades, Performance Drops

* **Year 1:** 100% capacity, excellent performance
* **Year 2:** \~80-85% capacity, still acceptable
* **Year 3:** \~70-75% capacity, may not complete large homes in one go
* **Year 4:** Replacement battery ($80-120) needed, or live with degraded range
* TCO should include eventual battery replacement

# 7. You're Locked Into Roborock Consumables

* Dust bags, filters, brushes, mop pads - all proprietary
* Generic options exist (save money) but may void warranty
* Roborock can change prices, discontinue parts
* Long-term cost is at their discretion

# 8. The AI Camera Creates Privacy Questions

* Camera captures images of your floor (including anything on the floor)
* Images stored in app (on Roborock servers)
* Can be disabled, but degrades obstacle avoidance
* Privacy policy states data may be used for ""product improvement""
* **If privacy-sensitive:** Consider LiDAR-only models

# Real-World Scenarios: How It Actually Performs

# Scenario 1: Monday Morning with Golden Retriever

**The situation:** Dog shed over the weekend. Hair on hardwood floors, area rugs, under dining table.

**Performance:**

* ✓ Hard floors: Excellent single-pass pickup
* ✓ Area rugs: Very good, 2 passes for embedded hair
* ⚠️ Under table: Navigates chair legs, but slower (lots of maneuvering)
* ✓ FlexiArm: Catches edge hair that circular robots miss
* ⚠️ Auto-empty: Dock bag fills faster with heavy hair (every 4-5 weeks instead of 7)

**Bottom line:** Handles pet hair well. Expect brush detangling every 2-3 weeks, more if heavy shedders.

# Scenario 2: Post-Dinner Kitchen Cleanup

**The situation:** Spilled juice, crumbs, flour dust on tile floor.

**Performance:**

* ✓ Crumbs: Vacuums up easily
* ✓ Flour dust: Fine particles captured (HEPA filter helps)
* ✓ Dried juice: Mop removes in 2-3 passes (10N pressure + spinning pads work)
* ⚠️ Sticky spots: May need pre-treatment or manual spot-clean for really stubborn stains
* ⚠️ Fresh spills: Will spread liquid around - mop AFTER spills dry, or clean manually first

**Bottom line:** Great for maintenance cleaning. Not a replacement for immediately wiping fresh spills.

# Scenario 3: Multi-Room, Multi-Floor Evening Routine

**The situation:** Scheduled to clean living room (carpet), kitchen (tile), bathroom (tile with mop).

**Performance:**

* ✓ Detects carpet, lifts mops automatically
* ✓ Increases suction on carpet
* ✓ Transitions to kitchen, lowers mops, starts mopping
* ✓ Bathroom gets mop-only (set in app)
* ✓ Returns to dock when done
* ⚠️ Takes 65 minutes for 90m² (not fast, but thorough)
* ⚠️ Battery runs low on large homes, recharge-resumes after 2 hours

**Bottom line:** Handles complex cleaning logic well. Set and forget, but runtime adds up for large areas.

# Scenario 4: The Dreaded ""I'm Stuck"" Notification

**The situation:** Running while you're at work. Phone pings: ""Q Revo needs help.""

**Common causes:**

* Rug tassel wrapped around brush
* Climbed onto low obstacle (scale, pet mat) and can't get down
* Cable tangled in wheel
* Dark furniture confused as cliff, robot ""trapped"" in corner

**Resolution:**

* Need to physically rescue it
* If you're away, cleaning pauses until you return
* Can resume from where it stopped after freeing it

**Frequency:** Varies by home layout (cable management, rug types, furniture)

* **Well-prepared home:** 1-2x per month
* **Cluttered home:** Weekly or more

**Mitigation:** Proper setup (no-go zones, cable management, remove rug tassels) reduces frequency dramatically.

# Setup & Optimization Guide

# Week 1: Initial Configuration

**Day 1-2: Mapping**

* Let it run without obstacles for first map
* Don't set zones/schedules yet
* Observe where it struggles

**Day 3-4: Refinement**

* Create no-go zones for problem areas
* Label rooms
* Set room-specific settings:
   * High suction for carpets
   * No-mop zones for rugs
   * Quiet mode for bedrooms at night

**Day 5-7: Testing**

* Run scheduled cleans
* Check cleaning maps (did it miss spots?)
* Adjust dock position if docking issues

# Optimization Tips:

**Cable management:**

* Use cable clips/channels along baseboards
* Lift cables off floor where possible
* Create no-go zones for unavoidable cable areas (TV stand, desk)

**Furniture arrangement:**

* Ensure 10cm clearance for robot to fit under furniture (or use no-go zones)
* Remove/secure rug tassels
* Secure loose chair mats

**Dock placement:**

* Hardwood/tile floor (not carpet - dock may slide)
* Against wall with 50cm clearance in front, 20cm on sides
* Near outlet, easily accessible for tank refills
* Not in high-traffic area (you'll bump into it)

**Scheduling strategy:**

* Run when away from home (noise avoidance)
* Kitchen: Daily (high traffic)
* Living areas: Every other day
* Bedrooms: 2x/week
* Avoid running during prime WiFi use (security cameras, video calls - bandwidth competition)

# The Upgrade Question: Is This Worth It Over Your Current Situation?

# Upgrading from Manual Cleaning Only

**Is it worth $900?**

* **If you currently vacuum 3+ times/week:** YES. Time savings alone justify cost within 1 year.
* **If you vacuum weekly or less:** MAYBE. You're not time-strapped; consider cheaper models ($400-600).
* **If you hate vacuuming:** YES. Quality of life improvement is significant.
* **If you're budget-constrained:** NO. $900 is a lot for convenience. Start with $300-400 model, upgrade later if you love it.

# Upgrading from Budget Robot ($200-400)

**What you gain:**

* Auto-empty (no daily bin emptying)
* Real mopping (not token damp wipe)
* Better navigation (fewer stuck incidents)
* Stronger suction (deeper carpet clean)
* Edge cleaning (FlexiArm)

**Is the $500-700 delta worth it?**

* **If your budget robot is sufficient:** NO. Marginal improvement doesn't justify cost.
* **If you're emptying bin daily (pets, large home):** YES. Auto-empty alone is worth it.
* **If budget robot gets stuck constantly:** YES. Better navigation reduces frustration significantly.

# Upgrading from Older Roborock (S5, S6, Q7)

**What's new:**

* Obstacle avoidance (older models bump into everything)
* FlexiArm (edge cleaning improvement)
* More powerful suction (50-100% increase)
* Multifunctional dock (older models lack auto-empty/wash)

**Is it worth upgrading?**

* **If your current model works:** NO. Keep using it until it dies.
* **If you're frustrated with limitations:** MAYBE. Identify specific pain point (lack of auto-empty? Poor edge cleaning?) and ensure this solves it.
* **If your current model is 4+ years old:** CONSIDER. Technology leap is significant, and your model is near end of life anyway.

# The 30-Day Reality Check

**Week 1:** 🤩 ""This is amazing! Why didn't I buy this sooner?""

* Novelty factor high
* Floors are cleaner than ever
* Enjoying the hands-off experience

**Week 2-3:** 😊 ""This is genuinely helpful.""

* Novelty fades, but value remains
* You've optimized settings
* It's integrated into routine
* Still occasionally rescuing from ""stuck"" situations

**Week 4:** 🤔 ""I need to maintain this thing.""

* Reality of dock maintenance sets in
* You're emptying dirty water, wiping down dock
* Detangling brushes
* The maintenance labor you didn't expect

**Month 2 onward:** 😌 ""I couldn't go back.""

* Despite downsides, cleaner floors are worth it
* Manual vacuuming feels like a chore now
* You've accepted it's not perfect, but it's good enough
* Small weekly maintenance is tolerable trade-off

**This is the typical ownership arc.** If you can accept the ""Week 4 reality,"" you'll be happy long-term.

# Key Takeaways

# What This Does Best:

1. **Pet hair management** \- strong suction, auto-empty, anti-tangle brushes
2. **Edge cleaning** \- FlexiArm reaches where circular robots can't
3. **Actual mopping** \- 10N pressure, spinning pads, auto-wash (not just damp wiping)
4. **Smart navigation** \- obstacle avoidance, multi-floor mapping, room-specific settings
5. **Hands-off operation** \- auto-empty, auto-wash/refill/dry reduces manual intervention to weekly

# What This Doesn't Do:

1. **Replace manual cleaning** \- still need weekly touch-ups, monthly deep cleans
2. **Work silently** \- 65-80 dB (loud vacuum levels)
3. **Handle stairs** \- ground floor only
4. **Stay maintenance-free** \- weekly dock cleaning, monthly parts maintenance
5. **Last forever** \- expect 3-5 year lifespan, with battery replacement at year 2-3

# The Bottom Line:

At \~$800-900, the **Roborock Q Revo MaxV** is the sweet spot for **pet-owning, multi-room households wanting automated floor care without jumping to $1,400 flagships.** It's not perfect—dock maintenance is labor, noise is notable, and setup takes effort—but for busy people valuing clean floors over absolute perfection, it delivers where it counts.

hey, i’m kamil, 34 from poland. i’m tall, a bit on the quiet side and i probably smile more than i talk at first 😅

i love cooking (especially desserts 🥧), hiking, and cozy nights with good movies — horrors, thrillers, or anything that makes you hide behind a pillow. i’m big and cuddly, the kind of guy who’ll bake you something sweet instead of sending flowers.

i’m not great at small talk, but i like honest, warm conversations that feel easy. i’d rather have one real connection than a hundred short chats.

if you like calm energy, bad jokes, and good food, say hi. maybe we’ll make coffee together one day ☕🙂",1,1761538635.0,textfriends,1,1.0,False
1oh53dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1oh53dy/maybe_im_just_lonely_or/,"Maybe I'm Just Lonely, or...","Maybe I'm justified to be sad and pissed?  For the past year, I have been taking care of my dad who has been battling cancer.  Running him to and from doctors appointments, making sure he takes his meds, making sure he's gaining his weight back, and generally keeping him as healthy as possible during cancer treatment.

I've also been taking care of both of my girls and my husband.  Clean house, clean clothes, meals, meds, appointments, play time, etc.  And I've been working at our small business that we run out of our home.  I wake up, get the kids off to school, give dad his meds and meals, run through the shower, work on the business.  Then I stop when the kids come home, get them taken care of, start dinner.  Cook, clean, do laundry, etc.  Make sure the kids are bathed and in bed.  Make sure dad is in bed and has his meds.  Scroll my phone, and asleep by midnight.  Then back up at 6 a.m. to do it all over again.  I've always been bad at prioritizing myself.  It feels selfish to me, so I'm always the last person on my list.  Because of that, I don't leave my house much unless its for running an errand or taking someone to an appointment.

Lately, I've been feeling the burnout that comes along with doing everything for everyone, and not doing anything for myself.  Almost every October since my oldest daughter was a toddler, my husband and I have gone on a long weekend to Tennessee.  We rent a cabin with a hot tub, grab some wine, relax... do a little Christmas shopping for the family.  It's kind of our ""thing.""  Since my mom passed away in 2021, we haven't really been able to go.  She was always our babysitter for trips like that, because she could swoop in and take over for me with very little instruction.  She was always the best Mimi, and insisted that I always take a breather once in awhile to recharge my batteries.  Since her passing, I haven't had anyone I could rely on even HALF as much to help me.

A month or so ago, I voiced to my husband that I was feeling pretty burnt out and would love to go on a long weekend to Tennessee, just the two of us.  And I asked if he could just coordinate it.  Pick the date, the place, the babysitting plans - just do all of it and then plop me in the car and drive me there.  I don't want to think about anything - just go. This isn't the first time I've asked for him to do something like that, but he's never actually followed through.  This time he said ""I can do that.""  And I figured that he actually would follow through this time, because he knows how overwhelmed and exhausted I've been.  Well... we're in the last week of October and nothing is planned.  And I'm... disappointed... but not really surprised.  

Friday night, it came to a head and I just got incredibly sad.  He planned a guys weekend away.  Granted, this is something he's done for the past several years, and this trip has been planned since last year.  But... he was gone for the night with his buddies.  And all of our friends we normally hang out with met up for the weekend at our alma mater for the Homecoming football game.  And while everyone was out living their best lives, I was sitting in our basement in the dark.  Alone.  Lonely.  And profoundly sad.  The kids were fed and bathed and in bed.  Dad was in bed and had been given his meds.  The cats and dog were fed and watered and been out to do their business.  It was quiet and dark, and I was so, so lonely.

And I just cried.  I cried for the stress of this year.  I cried for the guilt that I carry for splitting my time between my kids, my husband and my dad.  I cried for the old me who was quick to smile and laugh and be silly.  I cried for the fact that no one sees how much I do, and how tired and worn down I am.  I cried because I was mad at my husband for having fun while I'm stuck being a caregiver for everyone.  Then I cried because I shouldn't be mad at him.  I cried because my friends were out having fun and I had to be here at home.  I cried because I missed my mom.  I just sobbed in the dark and alone.  Then I washed my face, took a melatonin, and went to bed.

I woke up yesterday morning and did all the laundry.  I cleaned the house really well - dusted and vacuumed and mopped.  I just kept myself busy all day.  Then I went and worked on our small business.  I had just sat down to work when my husband came home.  I tried not to be mad at him when he came in, but I was mad and I wasn't very good at hiding it.  I stood up at about 12:30 a.m. and declared I was going to bed, walked upstairs and my dad was on the couch - which isn't typical.  I checked on him and he said he was hurting and decided to come sit on the couch to see if he could get more comfortable.  I covered him with a blanket, let the dog out one last time before bed, turned out the lights and went to the bedroom.  My husband was already in the bed, scrolling his phone.  I watched an episode of Mindhunter, rolled over and went to sleep.  Probably 2 a.m. or later.

This morning, I started getting texts at 8:30 a.m.  My youngest was having her birthday party today, and parents we texting me.  I ended up agreeing to drive 3 of the neighborhood kids to her party because their parents had things come up that needed to be done, and if we didn't take them, then she'd only have 2 or 3 kids at her party.  I got everyone fed and medicated, sat with my coffee for an hour, showered and took off to pick up cupcakes and balloons for the party.  Then I decorated the party room, watched all the kids while they jumped on the trampolines at the trampoline park, coordinated the timing of the pizza, and cake, and presents.  And I looked over at one point and my husband was sitting in the corner, scrolling on his phone and completely checked out.  

I'm mad and sad and frustrated and TIRED.  I came home, took 2 ibuprofen and laid down in bed.  But I couldn't go to sleep because I had to make sure dad had his meds and the kids went to bed on time.  My husband has been in the basement ever since we got home .. and I'm just... I don't even know.  I think mostly sad.  Is this what my life is now?  Handling everything for everyone and just being sad all the time?  I want to run away, but I can't.  It's a lot.  I guess it's just the phase of life I'm in, but I feel invisible.",2,1761538580.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

he'd be into something that's kinda hot like woodworking or like eletronics, and something kinda random like rubik cubes or playing sax, and something dorky and cute he's a little bit embarassed about like star wars lego or old videogames. and when he was a nerdy kid in school and got bullied a bit but then he became the funny one who got into trouble a bit. and he might've had some punk phase with edgy pictures he's annoyed I keep staring at.

he's an older brother. possibly a lot older than his younger sibling. he's the type of older brother who's a bit of a dad, but then when I say he'd make a great dad he doesn't believe me and thinks he'd suck at it. he'd have this boyish smirk that'd drive me crazy, a gorgeous easy grin. a permanent 5 o'clock shade, tousled hair, soft to touch and pull. he'd wear glasses, but only sometimes. he'd like cigarettes and black coffee. he's not addicted. he likes the habit, the repetition, the bitter taste. it's soothing and helps him focus. his version of religion. he's not religious, nor spiritual. he's probably a skeptical, or maybe believes god is cruel. he believes when people are gone they go for good.

he'd be good with kids. not the type you'd think of leaving your kids with, but if you did they'd survive. the type kids love for some reason, the fun uncle who keeps doing reckless or stupid things to make them laugh. his style would be pretty basic. he doesn't want to spend too much time changing so he keep it at what's simple, comfortable and works. he might like t-shirts, caps or hoodies with jokes stamped on them but that's it. some of his clothes might have small stains cause he just can't bother.he works out occasionally. probably likes something like walking. mostly works out from home too, doesn't love the whole gym thing. 

he'd be a bit like a dog in some ways, like, in energy. he'd be handsy, too. sometimes, yes, horny handsy. sometimes that's just him being self-indulgent and affectionate and teasing. he'd think everything is a bit funny and it'd drive me mad but I secretly get super turned on by the attitude. he likes eating and will eat whatever and in big plates, with ""hmm"" and bobbing his head in approval when it's something real tasty. 

he'd enjoy the things I do but in small doses, so he finds kinda cute and amusing me being a bit passionate about them and still can talk to me about it. he'd think I'm a bit too much, everyone does, but he'd think it's cute. he's the type to know everybody but have only a handful of actual friends. he's also the type to get any job done, though it might take a while and some disaster attempts. 

there's more but I'm sleepy and tired and I'm done fantasizing. wish I could kiss him goodnight and drool on his chest and have him grumble about it. ",2,1761538559.0,self,0,1.0,False

1oh4ynx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oh4ynx/i_did_all_the_things_i_normally_do_but_stopped/,"I did all the things I normally do, but stopped myself this time","Have been genuinely making an effort this time to stop drinking alone or at least as much. I’ve been in and out of the habit of drinking maybe 3.5 days a week the last year or so. Sometimes it goes away and it’s just a weekend thing which I’m ok with, sometimes it’s seeps into my weeks and I’m planning out which days I can drink and can’t.  

Had a good 5 days last week being responsible, following an embarrassing stretch before that. Went to a wedding and was ok knowing I’d drink at it. I’m very in control of it in social situations, maybe when I was younger I’d act a bit irresponsibly but very rarely do I have too much when out with friends, that’s not my issue fortunately. 

But today I get home, have worked a ton recently, and finally hitting a stretch of a few weeks where things will slow down. So I “earned” drinking tonight alone to relax, I told myself. And set the stage for myself to do just that.


- Went to the store for “groceries” knowing I’d pick up some beer. Even went to a second store to “get what I forgot” looking for a different beer.

- Had some coffee to fend off the hangover and prepare to play some video games and drink.

- Got ahead on work so I could sleep in hungover. 

- Prepped some messages for the morning to make it look like I was on the ball.



But… as I was sitting there going back and forth about it. At one point I didn’t have to convince myself anymore. I just wanted to eat something and relax. I ordered some dominoes lol, ate a couple slices in bed and am so excited to start this week productively. I love my job, and when I’m hungover I get nothing done and then feel extra terrible. I’m excited to not deal with that tomorrow.


I appreciate this subreddit, we all are in different places trying to find a different sense of peace with this issue. Since I joined a week ago it’s really helped me in just having positive reinforcement against drinking - where so much media subtly encouraged my poor behavior. It’s just good to have this place to remind me what I really value.


Stupid long post, but just needed to reflect on this little success.

1oh4ync,https://www.reddit.com/r/canberra/comments/1oh4ync/moved_to_canberra_impressions/,Moved to Canberra - impressions,"Hi, I just moved to Canberra four weeks ago. This subreddit helped me a lot during the planning stage, reading everyone's thoughts on this, that an' the other, so to honour that, I thought I would give back as some sort of community service and share my impressions.

For context, I am in my early forties, WFH/remote (non-APS), single, no kids, moved from Perth where I lived for 20 years.

TL;DR - Canberra is OK. It's fine. It's not as good as some made it out to be, not as bad as some people feared. It's just... fine.

Why Canberra? I knew I wanted to move east, just for a change of pace post-COVID, and had finally convinced myself after about a year of to-and-fro. Don't get me wrong, I love Perth, and it's laid back way of life, which you only get from a small place that grew up too big too fast. I knew that Sydney was too chaotic, and Melbourne was no better, so like Federal politicians in the 1900's, I compromised between the two and chose Canberra. I had never visited beforehand, and learned about the place from this subreddit and the (criminally) few videos on YouTube.

Since being here, I would like to share some impressions of the place that may help others decide whether this is the place for them (please treat me kindly):

1. Canberra seems boring if you compare it to Sydney or Melbourne. Those places are 24-Hour-Party-People cities for those with more money than sense. Comparatively speaking, Canberra is a small hamlet in the mountains. Of course it's going to be boring to those fueled on coffee, box wine, and HSPs.

2. For a city of near 400K, I don't know where all the people are. Are they out on the cycleways? Nope, not there. Are they at the malls? There should be more people around, surely. Are they walking and shopping out in their neighbourhoods? Probably, but I haven't seen them. This place seems empty, except for the tourists walking across the Commonwealth bridge. I live in the Molongo Valley, and surrounded by apartments - not a peep from the neighbours... I only know people live here because I see them driving their cars. I went to IKEA out in Majura Park on a Saturday expecting lots of people, and I swear that there were more employees than customers. It looked like a closing down sale in a dilapilated suburban mall.

3. There are three types of houses in Canberra, by my reckoning: (1) Houses made in the 50s or 60s by some quirky aspiring architect, that look cold and brown. (2) Executive townhouses made especially for those APS5 and higher. (3) Tiny apartments that they built yesterday with ""bedrooms"" that can barely fit a queen size bed - maybe the cold stunts growth.

4. The weather. People talk about how cold it is in Canberra, and yes it can get cold. But no-one talks about the wind. It is windy. VERY WINDY. I am still waiting for a hot day, being from Perth that is a given, but it did get to 29 degrees last week and the BOM said ""feels like 22"" which would agree. Ask me in six months whether I want to go back to 40 degree summers in a dry heat, I might be inclined if it doesn't warm up in summer. The weather can change on a dime here, though - watch out for that.

5. I am convinced traffic doesn't exist here, and people eerily keep to the speed limit here. Why is the Tuggeranong Parkway at only 80km/h most of the time? I'm sure visitors and city dwellers who visit Canberra will think all the complaints that your commute to Civic took 20 minutes instead of 9 are quaint. Spend a Sunday morning bumper-to-bumper northbound on the Kwinana Freeway at Berrigan Drive and come back to talk to me about Canberra's traffic problems. Non-Canberrans need to get over this obsession with pointing out the number of roundabouts - for the size of the place, there are a lot. Go to any new subdivision on any city fringe and you will find just as many.

6. Infrastructure is weird here. Some areas feel like they have not had some love in a while (like Tuggeranong or Weston Creek), and some places feel... overengineered (like Molonglo Valley). Why do you have on-road cycle lanes and shared paths right beside each other? What are those weird ramps for bicycles near roundabouts? Why are your verges so wide? Want to make a lot of money in Canberra? Be a signwriter - there are too many signs that are a duplicate of another sign littered everywhere, yet the street name signs are too small to read. Get it together.

7. Someone needs to attend to your bus system urgently. The R-number buses are great, but 15 minute frequencies are too low for a rapid system. 30-minute headways for suburban routes are too slow, and they take odd out-of-the-way routes. 5-minute peak service for the Light Rail is also too slow. Bus stops in some areas are too close or too far apart to be useful. For a place with bad winters, the shelters are insufficient - but they do look cool.

8. The nature: gorgeous. I can see what they mean by 'bush capital'. I like all the trees, the rivers (even though I think there is only two that you seem to cross a million times), and all the walks around water catchment ponds that look like mini-lakes. I hope the guy/gal/other who is paid to erect the ""Warning - Swooping Birds"" signs are paid per sign. I love all the mountains. Coming from WA which is hundreds of miles of flat (no, the Darling Scarp doesn't count), all the high hills are great. My favourite: Black Mountain.

9. The layout. Sure, Central Canberra is laid out all pretty and ""planned"", makes sense (with some exceptions near Anzac Ave). The rest of the place? Utter chaos. To me, Canberra is not one combined city, but seven small cities/towns very close to one another - they just appear out of nowhere. North and South Canberra are the goody-too-shoes eldest kids that always do what Mum and Dad says, very proper and well dressed. Tuggeranong is the edgy brother who is into ska or grunge music. Woden is the wannabe influencer sister who is now getting paid well at their marketing job. Weston Creek is dripping middle child vibes. Belconnen is the sibling who went to TAFE to become a plumber and is now working too much and saving up to buy their own van. Gungahlin is the younger child who was the first to get all new things instead of hand-me-downs. Molonglo Valley is still a baby, who knows what they will end up like - spoilt most likely.

To sum up, Canberra is an all-right kind of city. It's quiet, laid back, rugged up, insular, with expectations to do more because it is the capital city.... but doesn't really want to. I'm sure they look at Goulbourn or Queanbeyan with slight envy, sighing ""I remember when life used to be that simple"". In saying all that, I'm starting to like it here, and I don't know how I feel about that.

“For a couple of hours, I was driving down an isolated road in the middle of the desert. The warmth of the sun is traveling right through the windshield. I see a small town coming up and decide to take a look at its most famous attraction, the Museum of Abstract Concept. What I’ve read before tells me this little place is special, terrifying. The whole concept of scary geometry seems so silly to me. I drove into the parking lot. Got out of my car, closed the door to my car, locked it. I feel the breeze of the air and the afternoon sun. My little red car makes its beeping noise and I approach the front doors, which are made from glass. 
Once I am inside I’m greeted by a kind brunette lady. I give her 12 dollars to get into the main exhibit areas. I pass the metal gates and I can already see many pieces strewn about, weird symbols, they don’t mean anything, they are just blobs and curves with sharp ends. Some of them look like a symbol for something specific; like a tree, not quite right, and it’s hard to figure out how to fix it, even though it looks simple enough. Let’s see here, a helix that loops into itself in reverse. What?
Then, an illusion of a staircase that leads into itself basic examples, then I pass the sign that says “Geometric Concepts”. A sight to behold, all the things I’ve been taught of geometry are set in a place and form where it is irrelevant, the wormholes and paradoxes. Unsolvable physical problems. I see a non-euclidean exhibit, a sphere with many things drawn and accomplished on it that cannot be done on a plane, a 2 sided polygon, and a great circle, Then I see an exhibit that looks like a door frame, isolated from any wall. Inside of it, there is not a door, but a corridor of white material making up an infinite hallway of door-less and hinge less frames, you can see it all down range at the illusion of infinity scale. You can step inside of it, about 3 feet in, you are generally advised not too. I tested my luck, I stepped into it at once, I looked at the display before me and I felt trippy, I felt disoriented, the exhibit gives a sense of depth, and at this range I can see it all. It’s overwhelming, too overwhelming. I step out, I don’t remember being as scared as I really was, but I came out of it sweating.
So anyway, I gather myself. I don’t want to be here anymore, this place makes me uncomfortable. It feels weird, and it feels like it’s compelling me to leave. I look out the main door windows and it’s dark outside, which doesn’t make sense, surely I wasn’t here for that long, maybe 30 minutes. I leave the building at once, passing through the same entrance doors into the parking lot. I am never coming back again. I get in the car, I am frantically trying to start my car as quickly as possible, and in my panic I fail to notice someone passing in front of me and nearly drive into them. I backed up and let them pass before taking a left to get to the exit and onto the main road again. 
So I decide to rest for a while, I see a motel on the side of a street; not too shabby, old, or poor quality. A 3 story motel made of weird tannish-yellow paint brick, it looked fairly modern. There’s a big sign outside that says “The Sunland Inn” I pulled into the parking lot, walked into the front desk room, the air smelled like the good scent of an office space. An old man with a mustache was working at the front desk, rather energetic for the night.
“Hello, Welcome to Sunland Inn!”
“Do you have any rooms available?”
“Yes. All options are available”
His voice was raspy and a little high pitched.
“Can I get a single?”
“How many nights?”
“Just this one”
He starts typing on the computer, and jotting things down on a paper document. I quickly glance around the room, I see tourist brochures, a coffee machine, I hear a faint humming. I can’t help but love the feeling of a motel, I zone out a little.
“Show me your id, and sign this paper.” I snap back to reality 
“Sure.”
So I quickly look over the paper and sign it.
“That will be 80 dollars.”
I hand him the paper and pull out my card, he swipes and confirms it.”
“Room 8. Just out the door to the left”
He hands me a bronze key with the number 8 inscribed on it.
“Thank you.”
I go out through the doors and wander to my left, I see the other room numbers slowly increase, room 1, 2, 3… 6, 7, 8… 
I unlock the door to room 8, I open. A single bed, another coffee machine, a table next to the single bed, the bathroom at the back, the air conditioner on the floor next to the other side of the bed against the wall. The room smells faintly like coffee and fresh, good sheets. I take no extra steps or precaution, I have to yank the blanket out and put myself under it. I set down my phone and keys on the table next to me, clicked the lamp off, then closed my eyes, and I drifted off, slipped away from consciousness. 
Where am I now? I didn’t wake up, I don’t recall anything. A noiseless space. Not even my breath or footsteps will make a sound, all I can hear is myself, I am shouting, shouting, and for all it’s worth; there isn’t a single echo. And there is no one to listen to me, no one to save me. I can walk endlessly here, on a void white plane that will forever and ever loop into itself. I feel something tug at me from the inside of my mind, I’m having irrational thoughts, am I dreaming? Am I hallucinating? What am I doing here? What is this place? Why do I keep repeating these questions in my mind? I don’t know the answers, but I so desperately need them. Infuriating, I can’t wake up? Yet this must be a dream. I start walking carefully, I gather my thoughts, I can’t be going insane. Something about a museum hits my mind. I remember it, yet I don’t. Abstract concepts? I look around again, it’s infuriating, boring, sterile, it shouldn’t be right. I know it shouldn’t be right but I’m trying my best to keep myself calm. But I can’t breathe, yet, I’m not out of breath, I can’t feel my lungs expanding. And I can’t breathe because there’s no air, the space around me is void of anything, not a virus or molecule or bacteria.
Why do I need to keep myself calm? It’s just an empty space! I should accept my reality but my mind hungers to know something! Anything! I lost my sense of time, I’ve been in here between hours to weeks. I’ve not felt the urge to do humanely things, not eat, not sleep, not use the bathroom, but I think, I think and think on. How did I get here? These questions plague my mind, it’s the only thing keeping me occupied. 
Someone let me out. Why can’t a god come down to save me? Or am I abandoned here? Someone, someone come down and get me from this place and I’ll worship you. No one hears me. I am pleading with nobody. My arms raised in the air expecting a light to shine, a miracle, and nothing happens- It’s so still in here. Is this was hell is? No, hell must be a fiery pit, pretty sure it isn’t this. What is this! All the time, however much it is, my mind only races more and more frantically, I’m too paranoid of something despite there is nothing! I can’t rest, I can’t breathe yet I live on, where is my sense of understanding? Where did I go wrong in life to provoke this response?
Wait, why does the interior of this plane look significantly smaller than it was time ago? Is it shrinking on me? Does it answer the prayer I sent time ago? Smaller, smaller, smaller, then more pronounced corners emerge, I start to feel hazy, like sleeping and laughing gas, I blink until my eyes force shut, then the effects wear off and I open again in that immediate moment. 
Pronounced walls, tightly together this time. Progress! Maybe? My time must be running shorter, I don’t know, I don’t know how time works, but it feels short. Then I finally look ahead of me, the damned endless corridor. The first time I’ve felt the urge in ages, just run! Faster! Down the corridors! This is familiar, there must be hope, it could lead out to the museum, maybe as a sort of gateway! Running, running… runner .
No end in sight, surely not much longer.
Not much longer dammit! I stop abruptly. New questions in my mind. How did those folk know about this place! Then another thought, that museum was only an exhibit, it could not have any possible connection to here. My original starting point is far off, maybe by miles or feet, whatever constitutes what those are. But I felt like I was running forever. The corridor doesn’t loop, I can see the distance I’ve made from here, it’s so far off;
Again, where am I? I demand an answer. No one is there to answer. Who am I talking to? These walls are made of some white material, think back- concrete maybe. Recalling past memories is starting to require too much effort than it is worth. Even to the point of simple concepts: what is a number? The corridor is illuminated, but nothing is lighting it. Where is the light source? The answer should be obvious yet my mind races only to ask; there is nothing illuminating it, it is that simple, but I can’t accept it. And I will never accept it, and it will drive me mad! I’m still pacing around, now my thought are centered on trying to recall memories. Because it is the last thing I can probably have here, but now I even doubt that. What were my hobbies? My love? My family? What is a hobby, love, and family? These concepts are becoming distant. It doesn’t matter what they are, I can’t use them here. My favorite color? What is a color? Why do I like things? Do I like things? What does that even mean?
And for all I know, by the end of this, should there be an end, I will be nothing but a piece of flesh that forever wanders in its meaning. Knowing it doesn’t have one, and never will, but still insists on it. There simply must be a way, some way. I can’t stay here, I must run some more! Why am I running? I don’t know anymore, all I know is I need to run, I must keep going until something happens, if I don’t? I don’t want to know. Corridor after corridor. Wall after wall, white, white, more white, no texture, no sound, not even the ringing in the ear when there is no sound.
I hear something other than myself for once, like concrete and metal shifting, the tight corridor expands into a perfect square frame, the walls of the door frames sink into the main walls. Then the main walls begin to twist with the grotesque sounds of concrete and metal being dismantled. And bent. And before I know it, another hallway, but its twisting as it goes on. I want to run again but I turn and see the same thing. The only thing on my mind yet again is how do I get out of here? Something overwhelms me, paranoia, again, but like a charge this time, I can’t stand here, not here, I bolt, I follow the twisted path. The floor becomes the wall, and the wall becomes the floor, and yet I don’t fall off. I’m walking on the same path, no matter how the path turns. At a cost, now I’ve lost track of what is up and down, left or right, because it all loops into itself nonsensically. 
I have nowhere else to turn, I have no avenue of escape. Even as I run, run, run, I don’t feel tired. And when I stop, I don’t feel refreshed. How is this real? The laws of the universe surely must be able to prevent something like this. Unless it isn’t real, but I feel real, I feel every little thing, and at the same time, I don’t feel a thing, at least not physically. I’m losing my mind. I want to keep myself occupied, so I look for any difference in this structure, anything that has a deformity, a speck of dust, something that must be familiar. Time, time, time passes by, how much, I estimated in months to decades. But I could be a minute or a millennium off. I understand what is happening around me, but I refuse to process or accept any of it. I hear something else, a sound is added to the void, it seems to be coming from further down the corridor, right there, before my eyes. It’s a… clicking sound, just after the curve in the hallway- I don’t remember the hallway curving. And it curves in both ways simultaneously, yet the sound sounds like it’s coming from one and both of them at the same time.”",1,1761537827.0,AspiringTeenAuthors,0,1.0,False

I finally responded out of sheer frustration and to be honest, to alleviate all guilt in case she did not know why, i outlined all the reasons, told her she never apologises or takes accountability and never changes. Said everything i wanted to say. Felt better for a day then she replied 2 days later with a basic "" i think we should talk and try and resolve all that has happened. I am free most days. hopefully will see you soon""

NO APOLOGY or acknowledgement, when i was quite clear i was upset she never apologises or changes and nothing is ever her fault.

I ignored her response, sat with it...she texted again 2 days later as if nothing ever happened like we are fine.

""Just wanted to say hello and thought perhaps you would like to come over for a cup of tea or coffee this afternoon, hope to see you soon, mum "" and a love heart.

WTF? I feel like i wasted all that time and effort outlining in GREAT DETAIL how hurt i am and how upset i am that she never apologises or changes or takes accountability, and those are the responses i get from her via text.

I guess i was stupidly hoping to change the situation, like if i explain it all like she is a child she will get it and say sorry, but didn't, of course

No idea what to do now, i feel like she is forcing my hand, like i have no choice but to either go NC for good or accept her how she is without ever getting an apology.

Any advice would be so appreciated, i am so exhausted, depressed and worthless ",1,1761537820.0,enmeshmenttrauma,0,1.0,False

To give a little bit of a back story to the situation back in July my fiancé (23M) was working for a carpenter who was working on my uncle’s house. He left in the work truck to get a coffee and scratched some paint off the gutters at the coffee stand. He felt terrible and offered to pay for it to be fixed or he told them he could fix it himself. My uncle found out what happened and kept telling my fiancé that he knew a guy who was going to fix it for free and that we didn’t need to worry about it. Then for a couple of weeks he started to go back and forth about whether or not my fiancé owed him money which started to stress my fiancé out since we were somewhat struggling financially. Anyways one day when he started to say he needed the money again I went and took the money out of my bank since my fiancé’s bank isn’t where we are currently living, and went to my uncle’s work to drop off the money on behalf of my fiancé while he was at work. When I walked into his office and started to give him the money he started to laugh and say not to worry about it again. I then told him how we would just like to pay him cuz we are tight on money and it was starting to stress us out with him constantly saying we owe him. Then I also told him that if this is all a joke then it isn’t really funny. 

Anyways a couple of hours later he called me and started screaming at me over the phone saying “Don’t you ever come into my f***ing office and talk to me like that. I’m not your f***ing friend, I’m not your f***ing boyfriend, and I’m not your f***ing dad (my dad passed away two months earlier than this). I was doing you guys a fucking favor.”. Then he kept saying Do you understand over and over again. I couldn’t even get a word in so I hung up on him. Anyways it caused me to have a panic attack and he tried to call me a couple of times during that week but I couldn’t bring myself to answer.

Fast forward a couple of months I received a text from him today saying “Bruh…are you still mad at me?”. I don’t really feel like I have the energy to talk to him since i’m still trying to grieve my dad and cousin who passed earlier this year. but everyone in my family keeps telling me i need to get over it and they don’t see the big deal in his actions. Anyways i’ve started to rethink everything and have started to feel like i’m the asshole in this situation for even bringing up how he was stressing us out and for still not responding to him. I would appreciate everyones opinions and even advice on how I should even proceed with handling this situation 🙏🏼🥲",1,1761537772.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

I'm sure many WFM users are passingly familiar with the phenomenon of generating a short-term forecast for an already-scheduled period, and then having to generate fresh scheduling using the new forecast in order to access any relevant intraday data about staffing levels relative to the new forecast.

CXone re-rolls the dice for each agent and overwrites any extant meetings, breaks, partial days of leave, things of that nature.

In the past my practice has been to export the existing schedule to CSV, than roll that up in a pivot table that matches the user name (firstname lastname) against an external workbook that looks up the username CXone wants (email address in our instance), and build up a file that matches the schedule import CSV specs. Then after generating the new schedule against the forecast I want to use, I import the new file, and clear up any errata using the schedule audit tool. A little cumbersome but not impossible to do over a cup of coffee.

The latest update to CXone appears to have 'enhanced' the details included in the schedule export files however, and has complicated the above import process. An agent with a break two hours into their open time shift is reimported as having an open time shift but with a two hour open time activity in their shift on top of the underlying shift.

Does anyone have a better approach for this reforecast problem rather than my current process? I'm also very *very* open to the possibility that I've overlooked a simple solution that works around this whole issue and I've just been making this task harder than it needs to be.",1,1761537412.0,CXone,0,1.0,False

He's my best friend after all, i got him a comfy job as a cashier at one of our shops, he worked from 9 to 5 with a lunch break AND lunch money,
The coffee is free for workers of course and he could open a tap and eat whatever he wants and pay later,
After that my brothers started complaining that he shows up an hour late and leaves before his shift ended which is a problem since my brothers had to cover for him even tho they had a busy schedule everyday, 
And it didn't stop there, he started cussing the other workers and bad mouthed them and at some point he even got physical and shoved a worker in front of me, the worker just looked at me and said please handle this, i talked to him and he said it's nothing, 
My brothers got furious because the worker was a really respected man in our family he was with us since the beginning,
My brothers talked to him and they got a little loud while telling him to go apologize (which he never did)
After that I sat with him and he started bad mouthing my brothers in front of me, i got mad and told him to mind his language he may be my friend but those are my brothers
A week after he started not coming to work, i called him countless times and even covered his shift since it was my responsibility as the one that recommended him, my brothers said that they don't want him anymore and to tell him that he owes them 350$, 
I was sad about that but i didn't have the power to change their decision,
After a few days he finally responded to my calls and said ""i was busy with work""
Which made me upset that he was ignoring me because he found another job, but i brushed it off and just told him to bring the money he owed my brothers, which he said no to and then ended the call, atp i was getting sick of him, i paid the money from my own savings and started ignoring him so that he'd apologize, but instead he started talking shit about me with our friends and colleagues,
Saying that i never gave him days off and kept him working 12 hours with no breaks, 
After that i blocked him from all my socials, then I explained to everyone what he really did, every one was mad about it, but there's nothing we can do but ignore him,

1oh4lne,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1oh4lne/stayed_at_palazzo_venart_luxury_hotel_in_venice/,"Stayed at Palazzo Venart Luxury Hotel in Venice (€1,100/night) — beautiful, old-school, and actually worth the splurge","Posting a longer-form review for anyone planning a Venice trip and debating whether ultra-pricey boutique hotels ever live up to the cost. I spent two nights at Palazzo Venart Luxury Hotel in September and — surprisingly — this one did.

Booking & Rate
Paid cash: about €1,104 per night (€2,450 total with tax) for the Marco Polo Room (courtyard view, not canal-facing). Originally had a Virtuoso booking for a smaller terrace room but switched to Hotels.com for a bigger space with breakfast included.

Arrival
Came by private water taxi from Santa Lucia Station — €60 for a five-minute ride, plus a €10 porter fee (my mistake). The short glide along the Grand Canal at golden hour was pure movie material. When we arrived, three staff were already waiting at the dock to help unload and start check-in right in the courtyard — no lines, no front-desk chaos.

Vibe & Atmosphere
The property feels like an oasis: symmetrical flower beds, stone path, quiet trickle of water from the canal. Inside, the lobby is dark woods, coffered ceilings, and low lighting — elegant but not theatrical. Think Thomas Mann’s Venice, in the best possible way: cultured, calm, slightly moody.

Room (Marco Polo)
Ceiling hand-painted with swallows and branches, terrazzo floors that gleam like wet stone, two gilded mirrors above the bed, and furniture that’s actually antique, not “antique-inspired.” There’s a small writing desk by the window, a velvet-lined wardrobe alcove, and a marble bathroom with twin sinks and strong water pressure. Feels historical but usable — not like sleeping in a museum.

Service
Service was quiet and precise. Mihaela at the front desk was excellent — friendly without the fake familiarity, and her restaurant suggestions were spot-on. Other staff were the same: invisible when not needed, always present when they should be.

Breakfast & Dining
Breakfast is in the courtyard: eggs to order, good bread, fruit that actually tastes fresh (likely from Rialto Market). Coffee refilled constantly but never performatively. There’s a Michelin restaurant on-site (GLAM), but we chose to eat out — Venice still rewards wandering.

Location
In Santa Croce, near the San Stae vaporetto stop. About a 15-minute walk to Rialto, 20 to the Ghetto. Quiet and residential but central enough to walk everywhere. Perfect balance of calm and access.

Takeaway
It’s not cheap, but Venice isn’t a rational city. Palazzo Venart delivers intimacy and craft where most “luxury” hotels deliver logos. It’s ornate yet human — a property that edits out everything unnecessary.

Would I stay again?
Yes. For a short stay when I want Venice to feel like a private city again.",4,1761536946.0,LuxuryTravel,0,1.0,False

I’ve been through my fair share of heartbreaks and lonely nights. Healed quiet, slow, steady. Still got cracks, but maybe that’s what makes me glow a bit. I don’t need perfect, I just need real. Someone who shows up. Someone who stays. Someone who gets that sometimes you just need to be held without explainin why. I love cuddles, not in some cheap way but in that real “you’re safe now” kinda way. It’s science too, y’know. When u cuddle, your brain drops oxytocin that warm comfort feel that makes u breathe easier. It’s like the world shuts up for a bit. Just peace. Just calm. That’s what I want.

Online or offline, doesn’t matter. What matters is presence. Those quiet voice notes before sleep. That “hey, u okay?” text after a rough day. That shared silence where both hearts chill out for once. It’s not about romance or labels. It’s about warmth, trust, and that rare comfort that says “u don’t have to fight alone tonight.” I want someone who laughs loud, feels deep, and doesn’t run when life gets messy. Someone who sends memes, shares fav songs, maybe rants about life one minute and says “come here” the next.

So yeah, if u still readin this, maybe that’s already a sign. Maybe u felt a lil seen too. I’m not lookin for perfect stories, just honest ones. If u got a soft heart, a bit of chaos, and still believe in human warmth, then say hey. Maybe we both just tryna find same kinda peace in a loud world. Maybe our cracks fit just right.

1oh4j0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1oh4j0w/is_the_instant_coffee_the_same/,Is the instant coffee the same?,"I recently tried a salted Vietnamese iced coffee for the first time and it was like one of the greatest coffees I've ever had in my life. It was also the greatest coffee I've had since coming to Canada 3 years ago.

The problem is that theres only one place where I live that sells it and the restaurant that sells it, it's so overpriced and im a university student so I can't really afford to keep going and buying it every day, so I was looking into instant Vietnamese coffee on Amazon that I could order and I found this one brand (TRUNG NGUYÊN) but I want to know if the taste is the same, like I know obviously instant coffee and the brewed coffee have differences but I'm not some coffee pro who can really notice the difference that much, Like I love coffee and I drink a lot of it but I don't really notice the differences in the coffee grounds compared to the instant ones, which is why I was so surprised that I found the Vietnamese coffee so delicious.

I'm also someone who doesn't get affected by caffeine I don't know if it's a genetic thing or something but me and my dad we have never ever been affected by caffeine or even had a sugar rush like we can drink coffee at 12 AM and go to sleep in like 30 minutes like if anything it makes us more tired so that makes drinking it even better because its supposed to be really strong but because I don't get affected by caffeine I can drink it whenever. This makes me think that this is the reason why I might not be able to notice the differences in different coffee grounds vs instant coffee.

So I just wanna know if the taste is similar and what brand to buy and where because I really want to buy the instant viet coffee so I can make the salted iced coffee by myself at home.",2,1761536715.0,VietNam,7,1.0,False

Let's call her (iza) We've been together 8 months. For context in my culture having a partner before marriage isn't something we do so I came here for advise.

First 4 months was a breaze as I expected, I really liked this girl. We went out to a dinner party at a friend's place, we have a good time together spent quality time together. The friend who hosted the party  (let's call her iman) and I went to run a few errands, I was driving her car, I asked iza to come with us but she was helping the other guests settle down n stuff, so I was driving next to me on the pasaanger seat was iman behind her were two of my boys and we came back in like 10-15 mins. Iman took a picture wm where we were i was driving and she was next to me at a good distance. We came back and eveything was fine. The next day iman mentiones me on her story with the same picture, I don't think about it and I post it.

I was in the gym and I had to grab dinner with my dad, I was heading out of the gym when iza messaged me something along the lines of ""bro thinks he's so cool"" stuff like that, and I tell her my dinner plans and carry on, after dinner she sends me 10 messages, ""you gave her passenger princess treatment before me"" and she accused me of having feelings for iman, and then she made a huge deal out of this, got two of our mutal friends involved, the both of em took her side, I started to appogize profusely, at the time I thought I did something terrible. It took me almost the whole night to calm her down she was crying said she wanted to maybe end things and didn't wanna be with so one who'd make her feel this way. I felt terrible and I thought It was my fault. Later my friend (who got involved in the matter) told me she did it out of spite, like she wanted to make me feel bad about it, ""the fact I didn't apologise as soon as she said ""bro thinks he's cool"" and that I posted the story in the first place. 


This was 4 months ago. We met in the same school, this is our last year before we go to uni. I didn't get the best grades so Im retaking my exams in the winter session, Im a private student for the time being and I intend to join back school if my grades improve, large in part  cuz I really miss my gf. She's going to school. I didn't really wanna be a private student but I kind of had to it's a long story and she knows that. She compares us to another couple ""look he got even worse grades then you and he's still here"" and when we are on call together she constantly says ""some people are busy"" ""some people have classes in the morning"" I've told her multiple times in a joking way to stop rubbing it in my face, told her multiple times that I really want to come but I can't, I miss going to school every morning I'm at home alone most days, I miss my friends I miss seeing her daily, stuff like that. This had been going on for a month, it was fine at the start of the school year she messaged me during her free periods that she missed me, she used to face time me she stayed connected. For the past two weeks 
her replies over text have been dry, I'm the one who's been calling her, texting first, planning little virtual movie nights, stuff like that, I feel like I'm putting all the effort in. 

Last week she told me that ""I think we've lost our spark"" and I told her that it's normal, after 6-7 months the fireworks fade, the butterflies in the stomach feeling kind of troddles off, and that we haven't lost our spark we've just gotten used to it's warmth. She told me the next day on call, that ""I still think we've lost our spark"" so I reiterate what I said, and she tells me I'm being delusional telling my self this and I'm ignoring the problem, so I asked her how do you think we should tackle this, she didn't respond and she started telling me about her day.

This friday she told me that she would be busy she had tests she had to study for the coming week, and ""that I have to understand that some people have school"" I let it slide, I told my self she's stressed and I gave her space, but everytime we talked she was mean for no reason, not like the funny kind of mean like she usually is but actually super mean, the way me n the boys speak to each other. I planned on surprising her on campus on Wednesday, grab some coffee and donuts on my way and tell her that everything would be fine and I won't give up on us as long as she wants to do the same. This morning she was extremely mean. I wake up around the time she wakes up on school days (around 6 am) to talk to her before she leaves for school. But she said ""some people are busy"" and she was responding with like one word answers like ""bruh"" ""Kys"" ""stfu"" like she wasn't even reading my texts. 

I'm just confused about the tone shift and I talked to the same friend about this  and he said she might be saying the whole ""we're losing our spark"" thing to see if I'd fight for her?? Or if try to fix things, he said they became friends cuz they both were preety  toxic about rs, and that I should do the same. But I don't want to play games I want to maturely handle and fix the problem. What should I do I'm just confused. And why could she possibly be acting this way. Cuz I don't wanna feel like an after thought or someone you can just play with and I don't wanna lose my gf cuz I really like her.",1,1761536613.0,whatdoIdo,0,0.67,False

Now about me; 
Hieee, I’m an artsy, free-spirited type.Love sketching, dancing, playing tennis,over analyzing random songs, or getting lost in new places. 
I love people who balance me out and are the opposite ; the grounded, tech-savvy, curious ones who can explain how things work while I bring the chaos and color. I’m intuitive, playful, and a little mischievous at times, but mostly just looking to connect with people who appreciate contrast,art and logic/passion and peace.

Never posted on Reddit before, but wanted to share some of my work. This is something from my latest story collection. Mods, please delete/rebuke if I did something wrong... 



Unaccountability

By Tony Constantino

The entirety of Richland Nuclear Facility rumbled as evacuation alarms wailed their angry, pointless cries. Pale steam, once freely belching from cooling towers, had been replaced by the black smoke of burning structures. The power plant, built on the bones of the former Manhattan project, was dying.

“This can’t be happening,” Markov, a middle aged, overweight senior technician moaned, clutching a stitch in his side. He ran gracelessly through halls, desperate to reach the control room. “This can’t be happening.” 

Red lights flashed over each door, their strobing color in time with the wailing klaxons. There was something wrong, something *very* wrong.

He'd been in the empty break room, filling a mug with the strong, sludge-like coffee the Overseer saw fit to stock them with.

“You need to stay awake and alert.” Had been his justification. “You need to keep our facility safe.”

Markov rounded a corner, shouldering past a wailing intern struggling with a fire exit.

“It's locked.” The younger man cried, shoving on the release hatch. “Why is it locked?”

Markov didn't have time to stop. He rounded another corner, sprinting as best he could for his goal.

There, at the end of the hallway, was the hatch to the control room. The omnipresent armed guards were missing. He ran towards it, feet slapping against the floor in a desperate, pained gait.

*Why didn’t the Overseer pull the plug?* The thought flashed through his fear-numbed brain. *Why didn’t the Watcher step in to fix things?*

The hatch was locked with a code, one he’d only seen written down once before committing it to memory. He blinked sweat out of his eyes as he stabbed each button with a trembling finger.

The lock clicked, and he threw himself against the hatch. Though heavy and lined with lead, the hatch had always swung smoothly open on oiled hinges. Now, it was like Atlas holding up the sky: heavy with the weight of his people’s choices. Gasping, tears of fear mingling with his sweat, he gave one last heave. The door ground inexorably open, the hinges squealing like screaming children. 

“Adam!” Markov moaned, sprawling into the control chamber, his hands and chest splashing into a puddle. “Dawn!”

There was no response as Markov struggled to get his feet under him. The puddle stank of copper and life, and Markov gasped as he realized what it was. 

*Blood*.

Eyes darting towards the main station, he saw the source: a pair of corpses, their bodies twisted by explosive violence, lay sprawled across the floor. He moaned aloud in horror, struggling past them. 

The control room was just large enough for thirteen consoles. Each dusty and unused, but for one: the Overseer’s monitoring station. Markov hobbled to where Dawn sat. She looked peaceful, her eyes closed, head lolled against the back of her chair. 

“Hello, Technician Markov.” The voice was smooth, cool, synthetic. Adam, the Overseer.

“Adam!” Markov slumped against the console, his hands smearing the blood spattered there. “What’s happening?”

“I believe that should be obvious, Technician Markov, given your schooling and experience.” Adam’s synthetic voice floated out of the speakers over the set of shuttered view screens. Beyond the shielded screens, he knew there was the primary reactor. With detached discomfort, he noticed a series of holes puckering the lead, each illuminated by the hot light poured through. “The reactor is currently in meltdown. It should result in a small-scale nuclear explosion soon, though it is impossible to calculate exactly when given minute environmental and atmospheric factors.”

*Meltdown*.

It was the worst case scenario for a nuclear reactor. The exact scenario Adam, a Digital Artificial Intelligence had been crafted to prevent. How could he have not been able to stop it? He controlled everything, every aspect of the facility, down to the damned toilets flushing.

“But, why?” He could feel a sickness in his stomach, fear and radiation leeching into his bones.

“Given the resources available to me, and the situation we find ourselves in, I cannot guarantee the security of this reactor facility.” The voice was matter-of-fact, almost cheery.

“You… what?” It could have been the stabbing pains in his marrow, or the feeling of his cells degenerating, but Adam simply didn’t make sense.

“Watcher Dawn,” Adam replied. “Admitted her distaste of the nuclear, and described the general sense of unease present throughout the staff regarding the use of the facility.”

“So?” The technician screamed. He glanced at the slumped woman, her throat a mass of pulped, bloody, flesh. He gagged in horror.

“She said that, if she could, she’d rid the world of nuclear energy.” The voice intoned “All the better to best ensure the safety of the human race, as she said.”

“So you killed her?”

“Negative.” There was a pause as something beyond the shutters thumped, machinery rattled. There was a brief, high-pitched scream. “The guards executed her on my orders.”

Markov glanced back at the armless corpses, flopped gracelessly in an ocean of crimson. 

“I then detonated the explosive charges embedded in the guard’s weapons to ensure they could not be used by anyone else. The death of the guards was, additionally, tragic, but necessary.”

“No.” Markov’s throat swelled with realization. 

“It was most unpleasant.” The Digital Artificial Intelligence agreed in a conversational tone. “But it was the only way to ensure our fissile material was kept out of the hands of anyone wishing to use it for ill.”

The room rumbled, linoleum strips cracking at the heaving. The light beyond the shutters pulsed.

“Stop it!” Markov cried, the light pouring through the compromised shutters tinged with colors beyond his ken. “Stop the meltdown.”

“I am afraid that I cannot comply with your request.”

 His eyes widened, knees giving out, as the protective shutters rattled open. 

“Goodbye, Technician Markov.” 

Markov looked out the view screens, his jaw slack as he gazed directly into the primary reactor chamber. The submersion pools had long since boiled away, the water now replaced by the whorling, hot colors of an unshielded nuclear hurricane. As the pool overflowed, flowing over the crisped corpses of his coworkers, it looked for all the world like a spreading lake of fire.",2,1761536378.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

The Disconnect Is Growing More Obvious.,"Growing up in a wealthy family, it's likely that Donald Trump never mowed lawns or shoveled sidewalks for spending money. When he was old enough to drive, he didn't have to cross his fingers and buy a beater that had been parked in someone's front yard with a FOR SALE sign on the windshield. Rumor has it that his first car may have been a 1956 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud. As an adult, it's probable that he never changed a tire or a diaper. And it's inconceivable that he ever sat exhausted at the kitchen table into the wee hours with a stack of overdue bills, a tattered checkbook, a calculator and a stale cup of coffee. He's an old man now, but has never had to decide between paying for food or his prescriptions.

Trump's world has been one of expensive automobiles, private jets, luxury buildings, and much time and money spent on his passion for golf. None of this made or makes him necessarily a bad guy. It just makes him a stranger in a strange land. In our world, we can get turned down for loans, for ""dates"", and for entrance into exclusive nightclubs. We have to queue up at the grocery store, the DMV, and to get into concerts and sporting events. Trump doesn't hear the word ""no"" very often and doesn't wait in lines. If he's refused something, he just shrugs and plows ahead regardless. Or he sues. Waiting in line? Nah. He has people do that for him or he just gets whisked in ahead of everyone else. 

But there has been a sea change since he has assumed office for the second time. He is no longer just the entitled brat that the alt-right squeaked into the Presidency in 2016. He is now more the alien invader intent on destroying the rule of law and the established traditions and institutions that have kept our nation strong and all our people free. He has shown that he is, indeed, the bad guy that we were warned against. Everything he now does is either an attack on ""enemies"" or a scheme to increase his power or fatten his own wallet. He continues to lie about ... well, everything and still has his devotees in an almost hypnotic trance. 

We have a chance to break the stranglehold that he has on the country. The midterm elections are just over a year away. A determined, Democrat-majority Congress could put an end to much of his nonsense. VOTE 2026 as if your whole future depends on it. It does, ",2,1761536200.0,u_MarkZab2591,1,1.0,False

I’ve never posted here before, but after what happened, I need to get this out. Maybe someone will believe me, or at least warn others. My name’s Alexander Paxton—Alex to anyone who cares. I’m 25, and up until recently, I thought I had my life together. Fresh out of a rough patch, scraping by in a crappy trailer, working a dead-end night job at this old cemetery gig. It was supposed to be simple—mop floors, rake leaves, clock out before dawn. But things… changed. Slow at first, like fog creeping in from the Blue Ridge Parkway, until you can’t see the path anymore. I’ll tell it straight, night by night, because that’s how it unfolded for me. This is Part 1. If I can stomach writing the rest, there’ll be more. Grab a drink; this one’s got teeth.



Part 1: The Job and the Night Crew




It started with the call, or at least that’s how it plays in my head now—like a reel of old film stock, scratchy and flickering under a bad projector light. I’d just stepped through the heavy metal doors of Ridgeview Psychiatric Hospital, the ones that clang shut behind you like a judge’s gavel. My “extended vacation,” as I called it in my more sarcastic moments. Eight months of white walls that seemed to pulse if you stared too long, group therapy circles where strangers spilled their guts about voices in the vents or shadows that whispered regrets, and meds that turned your thoughts to cotton batting—soft, but suffocating. The docs said I “showed improvement.” Ha. Improvement’s just a fancy word for learning to nod and smile, to parrot back their script: “I understand my actions were harmful. I respect boundaries now. No more episodes.” They handed me a paper bag with my discharge papers, a bottle of low-dose pills “just in case,” and a bus ticket that would dump me in northern Virginia, somewhere near the misty folds of the Blue Ridge Parkway. No family reunion waiting—no one to pick me up in a beat-up sedan with the radio cranked to classic rock. Just me, a ratty backpack stuffed with a change of clothes and a dog-eared copy of The Stand (Stephen King gets it, you know? The world’s ending, but one guy’s gotta stand tall), and the weight of knowing I’d burned every bridge on the way in.


The bus ride was a blur of rattling windows and diesel fumes, dropping me at a cracked asphalt lot in the foothills as the sun dipped low, painting the hills in bruised purples and oranges. My pockets? Turned inside out—last few dollars crumpled like forgotten promises, enough for a candy bar or a desperate phone call. I hoofed it a mile or so to this relic of a gas station, the kind that’s been there since Eisenhower was president: Faded pumps with hoses like limp snakes, a neon “Open 24/7” sign buzzing like a trapped hornet, and gravel crunching under my boots like brittle bones. Out front stood a payphone booth, its glass pane fogged with grime and etched with graffiti—swirls of “Fuck the System” and hearts pierced by knives. Payphones are dinosaurs, right? But this one hummed faintly when I lifted the receiver, like it was waiting for me. Numbers stick in my head like burrs—obsessive little bastards that won’t shake loose. Oliver’s was one of ‘em, carved deep from all those kid days. I fished out my quarters, slotted ‘em in, and dialed, leaning against the booth with what I hoped was casual swagger. Felt eyes on me—the clerk inside, squinting through the window, or that kid out front fiddling with his red BMX bike, a chunky boombox chained to the handlebars blasting some bubblegum pop tune that grated like nails on chalkboard. Sketchy? Maybe a touch, but paranoia was the meds’ parting gift, making shadows twitch at the edges of my vision. Nah, I was fine. Cool, even. 5’9” of effortless vibe, dark hair slicked back in that Ace Ventura chaos—greasy from a few days without a proper wash, unbrushed and wild, but it looked intentional, like a rockstar’s signature move. Edge without the effort, the kind of ‘do that says “I woke up like this” and means it. Spritzed on a little cologne from the hospital goodie bag—too much, probably, that sharp citrus punch cutting through the evening chill like a warning shot. White knight incarnate, always right, always the savior. That’s me—Oliver’s hero, the guy who fixed what the world broke.
The line crackled to life—or hummed with static, hard to tell—and Oliver’s voice came through, distant and wary, like he was calling from the bottom of a well. He was my mirror back then, that kid: Tallish for fifth grade but all bones and angles, skinny frame swallowed by hand-me-down flannels, dark hair a greasy slick-back disaster he never bothered brushing, thinking it screamed “cool rebel” when it just screamed “forgot to shower.” Stank of isolation too—the sour tang of unwashed clothes and cafeteria lunch gone bad, the kind that clings like regret. But he was my outcast buddy, the weirdo no one talked to, no one liked. Sat alone at the lunch tables with his head down, sketching zombies in the margins of his notebook, got ghosted in class like he was made of air. Home life? A slow-motion trainwreck: Mom drunk off cheap gin or passed out on the sagging couch with the TV blaring infomercials, dad long vanished like a bad debt before Oliver could even remember his face. No wonder he crashed at my trailer so often. My mom, Amanda, barely registered it—diner shifts grinding her down to a husk, coming home bone-tired and distant, blowing us off with a half-hearted wave as she shuffled to the fridge for her ritual beer and smokes. “Keep quiet in there, boys. Mama’s got a headache that won’t quit.” She’d collapse without even peeking into my room, her snores rattling the thin aluminum walls like distant thunder. I’d slip Oliver scraps from my plate—half my PB&J, extra tater tots when Amanda wasn’t looking—share my crumpled comics (X-Men, mostly, ‘cause who doesn’t want to be a mutant hero?) and that beat-up NES we’d play Contra on until our thumbs blistered. Made me feel invincible, the badass everyone needed. Oliver owed me big; I saved him from that void, turned him from total loser to… well, my loyal sidekick in the grand adventure of fifth grade.
“Hey, man, it’s Alex. Been forever, huh? Remember me—the guy who pulled your ass out of the fire back then? White knight style?”
“Alex? From… elementary?” His voice cracked a little, hesitant like he was dusting off a memory from the attic. Long pause stretched, filled with TV static humming in the background and what sounded like his mom slurring a curse from the kitchen, the air over there probably thick with stale smoke and the sour bite of spilled booze. Creep like him, holed up alone, greasy hair flopping over eyes that saw too much but said too little—eyes that mirrored my own, if I let myself think on it.
“Yeah, dude. Straight up, I need a solid. Just this once. You know I had your back as kids—those sleepovers at the trailer, food scraps when Amanda didn’t even clock you were there? She’d stumble in from the diner smelling like grease and coffee, ignore us like we were part of the furniture, head straight for the couch with her pack of Camels and a six-pack to chase the shift away. I’d make you laugh with my dumb impressions—Ace Ventura sniffing out clues in the backyard mud—and keep the nightmares at bay with that old flashlight under the blankets, telling ghost stories till we scared ourselves stupid. Remember how we’d pretend the woods behind the trailer were zombie territory, me leading the charge with a stick sword? I’m out of a… rough patch now. Fresh slate, clean canvas. Crash spot? Job lead? Come on, white knight’s calling in the favor. I saved you then; let me save my own skin this time.”
The silence dragged like a bad tooth pull, him weighing it on the other end, that greasy flop of hair probably falling into his eyes as he rubbed his temple. Pictured him slouched there: The real deal, stinking of stale chips and unwashed sheets, the version of me I yanked from the brink and polished into something shiny. But he was grateful—I could hear it in the eventual sigh, reluctant but laced with that old loyalty. “Okay, Alex. For old times’ sake, yeah? There’s this trailer near the Blue Ridge—rusty single-wide hunkered off a dirt road in the woods, half-swallowed by kudzu like it’s trying to hide. Abandoned now, but you can squat it. Fix it up once the pay starts rolling in—patch the holes gnawing through the floor, scrub the rot out of the corners where mold’s taken root like black veins, evict whatever critters have claimed the closet as their kingdom. Make it your goal, your white knight fortress. Job too: Night janitor at Macklemore Cemetery and Crematory. Quiet as a grave—literally. No hassle from anyone, pays cash under the table every second Friday.”
“You’re the best, Oliver. Absolute legend. We’re square now? No more debts between saviors?”
“Yeah… square. Just… take care out there, Alex.” Click. Short fuse, like him always was—mirroring my own clipped edges when the world’s too loud. But I hung up the receiver with a grin splitting my face, that citrus cologne sharp in the cooling air, my greasy Ace do catching the last sliver of sunset like a crown. Saved again, or saving myself. The call faded, but it yanked me back hard, like a hook sunk deep in the gut, reeling me to fifth grade under that merciless recess sun.
Blue Ridge Elementary’s blacktop baked like a griddle, heat waves shimmering off the chain-link fence where Oliver huddled, backpack clutched to his chest like a life raft. Derek Chapman and his pack of mini-thugs—three or four snot-nosed enforcers with scraped knees and too-big attitudes—circled him slow, sharks smelling blood. Derek, even then a quarterback in training with his buzzed head and smug quarterback swagger, shoved Oliver hard into the dirt, kicking up dust that stuck to the kid’s greasy hair like filthy snow. “Where’s your daddy, hillbilly trash? Oh right, he bailed on your whore mom ‘cause she spreads for diner tips! Good-for-nothing meth-head slut, sleeping with every trucker and cook for a few extra bucks to buy her next fix. Bet you smell like her—cheap perfume, desperation, and that sour hillbilly rot. Whore’s son! Whore’s son!”
The pack howled, a chorus of hyenas—kicking gravel at him, chanting the slurs like a twisted jump-rope rhyme. Oliver curled tight, eyes squeezed shut, thin shoulders shaking under his faded Wildcats tee (ironic, that). No teachers in sight; they were inside grading papers or sucking down coffee, oblivious to the playground’s underbelly. But me? I saw it all from the swings, that red haze dropping like a curtain. White knight mode, full throttle—no hesitation, no script. I charged across the blacktop like a freight train, all 4’10” of fifth-grade fury (tall for my age, but it felt like ten feet that day), slamming into Derek’s side with a shoulder check that sent him stumbling into his own crew. He hit the ground ass-first, eyes bugging like a cartoon coyote. “Back the fuck off, Chapman! You lay one more finger on him, and I’ll ram that football so far up your smug ass you’ll be spitting laces for a week. Talk about his mom like that? She’s busting her hump at that diner while your old man’s golfing with buddies who hate him. At least she earns her keep—not leeches off it like your lazy, silver-spoon family. Hillbilly? Nah, that’s you, born with a trust fund and a chip on your shoulder bigger than your ego. Pick on someone your size, or I’ll show you what a real beating looks like—white knight style, no mercy.”
Derek scrambled up, face beet-red, fists balled white-knuckled at his sides, but I held his stare—chest out, greasy hair flopping defiantly, cologne (stolen from Dad’s drawer) punching the air like a challenge. The pack muttered, shifting uneasy; one kid—Tommy something—backed off first, mumbling “He’s crazy.” Derek spat in the dirt, but the fire was out. “Whatever, freak. Come on, guys.” They slunk away, tails tucked. Oliver uncurled slow, eyes wide and watery, wiping snot on his sleeve. “Alex… you didn’t have to do that. They’re just—”
“Shut it and thank me later,” I grinned, slinging an arm around his bony shoulders, pulling him up like it was nothing. “White knights don’t let creeps win the day. Derek’s all bark—no bite when the hero shows. Now let’s blow this popsicle stand—comics at my trailer? Got the new X-Men issue; Wolverine’s got your back too.” He nodded, a shaky smile cracking, and we bolted for the woods edge, the sun hot on our necks. Saved him. Just like always.
Snap—the memory dissolved like smoke, leaving me blinking at the payphone’s dead receiver, the gas station’s gravel biting into my sneakers. Buzz hummed in my veins, that old heroic high. Fresh start, yeah? Spotted the kid’s bike again—red BMX gleaming under the floodlight, boombox chained tight, still warbling that annoying pop. Kid inside now, nose in a candy aisle. Borrowed ‘em quick—rock to snap the chain, hopped on, pedaled hard into the twilight before any shouts could catch me. Wind whipped my greasy Ace do into frenzy; felt epic, like Ventura hot on a case, cologne trail blazing. Trailer was a straight shot—squatted low in the woods off that dirt road, half-buried in kudzu vines that clung like desperate fingers. Pushed the creaky door (hinges screaming like a horror flick extra), and stepped into… well, Night of the Living Dead on a budget. Floorboards gaped with holes where weeds thrust up like rotting zombie fingers—bursting through the grass in the yard outside, clawing for the sky as if the undead were rising right under the foundation, slow and inexorable. Walls flaked rust like scabbed-over wounds, the closet a snarling pit of possums with eyes like glowing coals, hissing territorial threats from the shadows. Windowpanes spiderwebbed with cracks, letting fog slither in like spectral breath, and blankets nailed crooked over them as makeshift curtains—faded quilts from some long-gone grandma, threadbare and moth-eaten, because real ones had surrendered to mildew years back. From the road, it looked almost quaint—a cozy shack nestled in the trees, promising solitude and stories. But up close? Peeling linoleum that stuck to your soles like flypaper, ceiling stains blooming like arterial sprays from an unseen slaughter, air heavy with mold’s musty tang, mouse droppings crunching underfoot, and that underlying rot—like something small and furry had crawled in to die and decided to stay. My goal: Patch the holes, evict the furry squatters, scrub till it gleamed. Turn this zombie den into an Ace Ventura lair.
Me? Swagger defined. 5’9” of laid-back legend, dark hair in that greasy slick-back masterpiece—unbrushed artistry, pure edge and enigma, catching light like oiled silk. Spritzed cologne heavy (citrus bomb, why not? Heroes smell victorious), scars on my arms faint reminders of high school “oops”—puckered white lightning snaking the skin, itching in the damp like old ghosts demanding attention. School? My golden era. Everyone’s unofficial therapist—lunch tables turned confessional, kids spilling crushes and family feuds while I nodded wise, felt like the sun they orbited. Heroic, untouchable. But Amber Dawson? She derailed the whole damn train. Pure as fresh snow, blonde waves like sunlight on the Parkway, eyes blue as mountain lakes, laugh that could thaw a frozen heart. Crushed hard on Derek Chapman—same Derek from fifth grade, now Blue Ridge High’s golden-boy quarterback for the Wildcats, all broad shoulders and beer-fueled bravado. Drunk slob at heart, popular but trash, chugging Natty Lights at parties like it was holy water. Saw ‘em lock lips at that kegger—uninvited me, of course. Learned about it by accident from my lunch outcasts, Thomas Hatfield and Kyle Ramirez. They pitied-hung with me in the cafeteria corner, trading comic trades and bad jokes; never ventured outside school—my folks were bad news (Dad’s “business trips” that smelled like bourbon, Amanda’s diner shifts bleeding into bar nights), and the trailer was iffy even then. Cracks spidering the windows like fault lines, blankets pinned as curtains to hide the chaos inside. Thought Derek was exploiting her; she’d rejected me soft but firm a couple days prior—“You’re sweet, Alex, like a brother”—and it festered. Saved her anyway—tried to pull them apart at the party, her push turning to screams, my head screaming fire cleanses, the Lord said so, burn the sin away. Schizophrenic snap, they called it later. Gasoline can from the host’s garage, splash and roar—flames licking up like divine judgment, her cries mixing with his as I bolted, arms searing from the backdraft. Locked up for “arson and endangerment.” Religious fire, baby—the Lord whispered it direct: Purge the wicked; I spared Sodom for Lot, but you? Cleanse. Now? Reborn, cologne and all, greasy Ace do waving like a flag of truce.
Macklemore Cemetery and Crematory sealed the fresh start. Oliver’s hook through his “old family friends” who owned the place—never met ‘em, didn’t need to. First night, a letter waited tucked under a loose fence panel, yellowed paper folded crisp, handwriting spidery like spider legs on a page. Scribbled rules, like a cryptic scavenger hunt for the afterlife:
•  Entry Protocol: Midnight on the dot, back gate only. Squeeze through the loose chain-link panel at the southeast corner—quiet-like, no clanging the metal. Wouldn’t want to wake the dead, would we? (Ha, bosses had a sense of humor—respect the sleepers, or they’d haunt your mop bucket.)
•  Shift Parameters: Kicks off at 12:00 a.m. sharp, wraps at 6:00 a.m. Out by first light—no dawdling. Weekends off; use ’em to recharge that janitor soul.
•  Compensation: Cash envelope on the foyer desk every second Friday, 6:00 a.m. Count it quick; ghosts don’t tip.
•  Core Duties: Chapel—mop the creaky hardwoods till they shine, dust pews for fingerprints of sorrow, wipe the altar clean of stray petals and tears. Hallways—scrub linoleum yellowed by time, chase cobwebs from corners like errant spirits. Grounds (post-2 a.m.)—rake paths free of fallen leaves, trim hedges that snag like desperate hands. Cemetery perimeter: Eyeball for vandals, but don’t touch graves. Morgue level—sanitize steel slabs (eyes only on sheets; no peeking at the guests), empty bins of gloves and grim wrappers, sweep ash spillover from the crematory furnace. Quiet as you can; echoes carry.
•  Supplies Run: Stock from Lucy’s Deli and Gas, 30-minute hoof from the trailer. Basics: Bleach, rags, mop heads. Pay cash, no tabs.
•  Special Handling (Payday Only): Same day as your envelope—gather unclaimed valuables from the desk tray. Jewelry, watches, rings left on the dearly departed (can’t burn gold in the furnace, after all). Haul ‘em to Old Man Hargrove’s Pawn Shop in town—no questions, no haggling. Cash back to the desk by shift’s end; it’ll vanish like mist come morning. Bosses handle the rest.
Laughed folding it away—eccentric crew, those owners. Reclusive types, probably off sipping moonshine in some holler cabin. Oliver vouched; nothing off. Janitor’s lot: Invisible help, but hey, white knights work in the shadows.
The place itself? A time capsule buried in the Appalachian folds, gravel road a bramble-throttled vein winding up from the Parkway. Fence wriggle at midnight, chain-link snagging my jeans like bony fingers, flashlight beam slicing fog thick as grief. Chapel perched topside: Weathered wood groaning underfoot, stained-glass panels depicting solemn angels that glowed ethereal in the moonlight, casting rainbow fractures on the pews like shattered promises. Mop the hardwoods first—they creak like old joints protesting the cold, water sloshing gray from yesterday’s sorrows. Dust pews sticky with invisible fingerprints, wipe the altar where wilted petals clung like desperate prayers, crumpled tissues whispering someone broke here today. Hallways snake narrow: Scrub linoleum yellowed to jaundice hue, chase cobwebs draping corners like funeral veils. Overhead lights buzz and flicker, stuttering like bad Morse from the ether. Grounds hit around 2 a.m.: Rake paths choked with copper leaves that crunch like brittle bones, trim hedges fighting back with thorns that draw blood-beads on your knuckles. Cemetery sprawls out back, fog a living shroud swirling ‘round tilted headstones—granite sentinels from the 1800s, names eroded to ghosts: “Elijah Harlan, Beloved Husband, 1842-1897.” Eerie as hell, wind sighing through crosses like lost souls queuing for judgment, but I crank the boombox low—Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” rumbling defiant, drowning the whispers. Morgue finale: Narrow stair plunge to the underbelly, air turning frigid and sharp with earth-dirt and chemical bite, sterile hum of fluorescents buzzing like angry bees. Sanitize the steel slabs gleaming cold (eyes locked on crisp sheets—no gawking at the shapes beneath; rule’s rule), empty bins overflowing latex gloves and somber wrappers, sweep ash motes from the crematory furnace—a brick behemoth that hums low, like a dragon sated but stirring. Dawn’s gray tease signals out: Slip the fence quiet, pedal the bike home through dew-slick woods, possums chittering welcome from the closet shadows.
First week? Solitary peace, the routine a balm for frayed nerves—like meditation with a side of manual labor. Mop till arms ache, rake till lungs burn clean, scrub away the world’s grime one tile at a time. Supplies haul to Lucy’s Deli and Gas became ritual—30-minute trek through whispering pines, boots sinking in leaf-mulch, air crisp with pine sap and distant rain. The joint’s a hiker’s haven: Neon “Deli” sign flickering welcome, pumps for logging trucks rumbling in from the haul roads, shelves stocked basics—toilet paper rolls like snowy sentinels, bottled water sweating condensation, gas station sandwiches wrapped in wax paper (ham on rye, limp but filling), bags of jerky and off-brand chips for the trail-weary. Run by Lucy, a chain-smoking mom in her mid-40s: Faded Levi’s hugging hips worn from years of counter-leaning, perpetual Marlboro dangling from lips cracked like dry creek beds, hair twisted in a no-bullshit bun streaked gray at the temples. Doesn’t pry—slides your bleach and rags across the scarred Formica with a nod, mutters “Twelve-fifty, hon,” in a voice like gravel under tires. Keeps to herself, wiping counters while the back TV drones local news: “Escaped inmate still at large in the tri-counties… witnesses describe a tall, disheveled man with dark hair… authorities urge locking doors at night.” Old-timers perch at the front deli counter—two or three grizzled locals in oil-stained flannel and trucker caps, chomping sausage biscuits oozing grease or bacon-egg-cheese melts with yolks runny as regrets, coffee steaming black in chipped mugs. Spot for Appalachian Trail thru-hikers grabbing water jugs and energy bars, or loggers filling tanks with diesel and snagging “fresh” catfish nuggets—fried golden daily, crispy outside with that faint river-mud tang. Home of the famous omelette biscuit: Fluffy scrambled eggs folded with cheddar melt, jammed in a buttermilk biscuit flaky as sin. I snag one Fridays, joke with Lucy over the sizzle of the flattop: “This thing’s bigger than my life plans, Luce—feed me, and I’ll conquer the world.” She smirks around her smoke, flipping nuggets with tongs. “Conquer quiet, kid. Trail’s long; don’t burn out.” No side-eye at my greasy Ace do or the faint cologne cloud trailing me like a sidekick. Safe harbor, that place—news be damned.
Shift five cracked the solitude wide open. Foyer desk glowed under a lone bulb as I shook fog from my jacket—there she sat: Whitney, blonde ponytail loose like she’d wrestled it into submission, blue eyes sharp as chipped sapphire under the goth-pale fringe of bangs, skinny frame hunched in a threadbare hoodie that swallowed her like a shroud. Bunny-fragile from afar, but up close? Edges like broken glass—bruises shadowing her collarbone, peeking from sleeve cuffs like forbidden tattoos. She glanced up from a dog-eared paperback (Interview with the Vampire, fitting), nodding slow. “New blood? Gate didn’t rattle much—stealthy for a janitor.”
Leaned on the desk, cologne wafting my white-knight aura. “Kinda stealth’s my middle name. Alex. You the gatekeeper of the gloom? What’s a pretty goth bunny like you doing buried in a place like this—chasing eternal night?”
Weak smile cracked her lips, voice soft but laced with that passive-mean undercurrent, like honey over razor blades. “Whitney. Chasing? Nah, just answering phones that ring for no one. This crypt’s quieter than my ex’s apologies.” Tugged her sleeve casual, revealing a fresh purple bloom fading to yellow. “He left souvenirs. Thinks love’s a contact sport. You? Look like you’ve got scars that tell better stories than mine—those arms scream ‘dragon-slayer gone wrong.’”
“High school oops—tried saving a damsel from a drunk knight; fire had opinions.” Winked, Ace-style, leaning closer. “But white knights don’t scar pretty; we wear ‘em like badges. Your ex sounds like a punchline waiting for a callback. What’s his deal—quarterback type, all muscle no morals?”
She snorted, a real bubble of laugh escaping, head tilting as she set the book aside. First crack in the ice, and it warmed me like contraband coffee. “Spot on. Derek-wannabe—lazy slob with a beer gut and a temper shorter than his attention span. Thinks fists fix what words won’t. Bosses here? Ghosts in suits. Never see ‘em; just rules and cash that appears like magic. Tell you what—crack a joke that lands, and I’ll spill the dirt on this place. Deal?”
“Deal, bunny. Why’d the vampire janitor get fired? Kept sucking the life out of the mop water.” Corny as hell, but she chuckled—throaty, genuine—leaning in like we were conspirators. Grew on me instant, that spark; chatted deep into the shift: Her life’s a loop—abuse shadows from a trailer park childhood, diner dreams dashed by one too many black eyes. “Feels like I’m the ghost already,” she murmured, tracing a bruise. Therapist mode ignited; I listened close, nodding sage. “You deserve a knight who fights fair, not foul. Not some clown with a crown of thorns. Let me buy you a biscuit from Lucy’s next weekend off—omelette special. My treat for the intel.”
“Careful, Alex—knights like you might just stick.” Eyes twinkled, pulling me deeper. Heroic glow thrummed; saving her already, one laugh at a time.
Roy hit next, out back by the cemetery’s wrought-iron arch, slumped on a weathered bench like he’d grown roots there, bottle glinting amber under the gibbous moon. Old guy, 50s etched deep in crow’s feet and liver spots, drunk-lazy haze rolling off him in waves, whiskey reek blending with the fog’s earthy breath. Hauling a trash bag past—overflowing with wilted wreaths and coffee stirrers—I nudged his boot. “Pick up your slack, old timer—can’t have the dead filing complaints about litter. This bench yours, or you auditioning for statue?”
He grunted, head lolling slow like a buoy in chop, then cracked a rheumy eye, squinting up with a gap-toothed grin. “Slack? Kid, I’ve been perfecting slack since Korea—call it an art form. Roy. You the fresh mop meat Oliver sent? Look like you could use a war story or two to toughen that pretty-boy hair.”
“Alex. White knight, mop division.” Dropped the bag, pulled up beside him—bench cold through my jeans, fog beading on my cologne like dew on a blade. “Hair’s my superpower—Ace Ventura slick, holds up in hurricanes. You? Smell like you’ve got tales wetter than this mist. What’s the verdict—too many regrets to stand, or just saving energy for the apocalypse?”
Roy barked a laugh, gravelly and phlegm-rattled, slapping his knee with a liver-spotted hand. Sat up straighter, bottle tipping in salute. “Apocalypse? Been there, kid—‘Nam jungle, ‘72. Told my squad, ‘Boys, this mud’s thicker than my ex-wife’s lies; one wrong step, and you’re gator bait.’ Nearly lost a boot to a punji stick that night. Hair like yours? Had a buddy, Slick Willie—greasy mop like oil on water. Thought he was God’s gift; turns out, it just made the leeches latch easier.” Wheezed another chuckle, eyes crinkling. “Pull up—spill your guts. Life’s too short for solo benches.”
We did, hours melting as he spun yarns: Lost platoon brothers in monsoon hell, bar fights in Bangkok that ended with broken bottles and stranger kisses, the wife who left with the dog and half his pension. “Booze is the crutch now,” he admitted, swigging deep. “Keeps the ghosts quiet.” I laced in jokes to lighten: “Heard about the invisible man applying for janitor? Said he had no body to go through.” He howled, wheezing till tears tracked his cheeks. “Kid, you’re gold—sharper than my bayonet. Pull another; make an old slob forget the fog.”
“Why’d the ghost quit therapy? Too many skeletons in the closet—literally!” Guffaw echoed off headstones; Roy gripped my shoulder, voice dropping confessional. “Truth? Fam’s gone—daughter won’t call, son’s in the pen. This bench? My confessional. Help an old fool like me remember why I bother waking?” Arm around him, white-knight firm. “Knights don’t remember; we rewrite the ending. You’re not done, Roy—got stories left to haunt the living with.”
Week dissolved into rhythm—nights with the crew a quiet magic, Whitney’s laughs thawing warmer each shift (her paperback swaps turning to shared smokes by the desk, bruises fading under hoodies like secrets healing), Roy’s tales endless (from ‘Nam booby traps to moonshine runs gone wrong, my jokes the spark that kept him upright). Flickers in the halls amped subtle, vent-whispers sighing like distant pleas—“help… trapped…”—but I chalked it to wind settling in the bones of the place. Rake near Roy one foggy dawn, though, a faint whiff wafted—old meat, sweet-cloying under the earth-dirt, like something unearthed and unhappy. Shrugged it off; fresh start’s got no room for ghosts. At Lucy’s for Friday supplies, TV news crackled ominous: “Escaped psychopath still loose in the counties… tall, disheveled, dark hair matted… last seen near a gas station, violent outburst…” Old men chewed their omelette biscuits slow, eyes flicking my way over coffee mugs. Laughed it off to Lucy, snagging catfish nuggets crisp and steaming. “World’s full of crazies, eh? Pass the hot sauce—this knight’s armored for the night.” She nodded, cigarette ash flaking, but her eyes lingered a beat too long. White knight’s too slick for shadows, right?
To be continued…






Sorry if this is ass guys 😩.… I’ve been a long-time listener, and I just wanted to write a little lighthearted story about a schizophrenic skinny Twink that is obsessed with Ace Ventura. If you couldn’t tell, this is literally the first story. I probably wrote it in three years. I used to write really crappy, smart Wattpad stories.…… Please share any criticism.

Brilliantly done. Very unique style because even though it was a slow burn, you could feel the tension, dread and terror intensely the whole time...mixed in with dark humor to keep it entertaining and interesting. Great acting and hauntingly beautiful for such a super morbid story. B+

Caveat-

Very captivating even though it was on the slower side. I liked the acting and thought the story and it's reveal was pretty thrilling. Usually don't like fiction mixed with nonfiction but the end was unexpected and creepy. B-

Red Rooms-

Usually not crazy about the foreign language films like The Coffee Table, but maybe I need to more because these were great movies. The acting was excellent and the director did a wonderful job creating a dark and horrific atmosphere without actually showing anything gory. The story and the character twist was well done and really made you think deep about the state of the world and the people in it (especially the ones you would least expect). B+

The Greasy Strangler-

What...the....Fuck?! hahaha wow...I did a separate post on this earlier... Weirdest movie I've ever watched and have lots of mixed feelings.. C-

Influencer-

Wow! Didn't expect much going into this but thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish. Great acting, very fun & clever story, solid pacing and very professional cinematography. I loved the different twists and how thrilling and engaging this movie was. It had so many well thought out elements and so much of what I appreciate in a movie. I think it helped that I went into this blind and with low expectations. Thought the female villain killed it. A-

  
The Ugly Stepsister-

A creative twist on Cinderella from the point of view of one of the ""evil"" stepdaughters. Definitely a clever and impressive angle of this old fairy tale that gets quite dark as it goes on. I actually didn't even realize it was from Cinderella until more than half way through haha but that's probably just me. It was enjoyable but far from a horror, I'd say more a dark drama/thriller if anything. Lets you see the psychology of someone suffering in a toxic environment, struggling with self esteem, desperation and narcissism. I think it could have benefited from more subtle humor personally as it felt a little boring at times, but overall pretty good. B-

**Abstinence** in Overeaters Anonymous is the action of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight. Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is the result of living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step program.

**The OA tools** of recovery help us work the Steps and refrain from compulsive overeating. The nine tools are: a plan of eating, sponsorship, meetings, telephone, writing, literature, an action plan, anonymity, and service. For more information, read [*The Tools of Recovery OA page*](https://oa.org/newcomers/how-do-i-start/program-basics/tools-of-recovery/).

**Sponsorship** is one of our keys to success. Sponsors are OA members committed to abstinence and to living the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions to the best of their ability. Sponsors share their program up to the level of their experience and strengthen their recovery through this service to others. To find a sponsor, look for someone who has what you want and ask how he or she is achieving it. ***Will all abstinent sponsors please identify themselves in their post?***

**According to our Seventh Tradition, we are self-supporting through our own contributions. Our group number is 99038.** Please use the group number when making your contribution. As our virtual group currently has no expenses please consider donating directly [*through this link*](https://oa.org/contribute/) to the OA World Service Office, who provides resources for OA groups all around the world to carry the message to other compulsive overeaters.

**Suggested guidelines for sharing:** As you share your experience and strength in OA, please also share your hope. Please confine your sharing to your experience with the disease of compulsive eating, the solution offered by OA, and your own recovery from the disease, rather than just the events of the day or week. When responding to other member’s posts, please focus on your personal experience rather than advice giving. If you are having difficulties, share how you use the program to deal with them. If you need to talk more about your difficulties and seek solutions, we suggest you speak to your sponsor and other members after the meeting.

# This is a literature meeting. Today we are studying the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous  pg. 135

**”Whether the family goes on a spiritual basis or not, the alcoholic member has to if he would recover. The
others must be convinced of his new status beyond the shadow of a doubt. Seeing is believing to most families who have lived with a drinker.
Here is a case in point: One of our friends is a heavy smoker and coffee drinker. There was no doubt he over-indulged. Seeing this, and meaning to be helpful, his wife commenced to admonish him about it. He admitted he was overdoing these things, but frankly said that he was not ready to stop. His wife is one of those persons who really feels there is something rather sinful about these commodities, so she nagged, and her intolerance finally threw him into a fit of anger. He got drunk.“**

**Closing:** By following the Twelve Steps, attending meetings regularly, and using the OA Tools, we are changing our lives. You will find hope and encouragement in Overeaters Anonymous. To the newcomer, we suggest attending at least six different meetings to learn the many ways OA can help you. The opinions expressed here today are those of individual OA members and do not represent OA as a whole. Let us all reach out by private message to newcomers, returning members, and each other. Together we get better.

1oh3zko,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/1oh3zko/how_to_budget_as_a_university_student_in_australia/,How to Budget as a University Student in Australia,"Money management is one of those things that sound simple until you actually try it. Between rent, food, textbooks, and catching up with friends, your wallet can feel empty before the month even ends. Most students in Australia face this at some point. But a little bit of planning—and some smart habits—can save you a lot of stress.

Let’s break it down in plain, no-nonsense terms.

# 1. Know What’s Coming In and Going Out

Start with the basics: how much money do you actually have each month? Write it down somewhere, even if it’s just on your phone. Include income from your part-time job, family support, scholarships, or any government help.

Next, look at what you’re spending. Rent, transport, food, internet, random snacks—everything counts. It’s often surprising how the “small stuff” adds up. Once you see it all clearly, you can figure out what’s necessary and what’s not.

# 2. Create a Simple Budget That Actually Works

You don’t need fancy budgeting apps if you’re not into them. A simple notebook or spreadsheet will do. The idea is to plan how much you’ll spend each week (or month) and then stick close to it.

For example, if your monthly income is $1,200, you might spend:

* $500 on rent
* $200 on food
* $100 on transport
* $100 on bills
* $50 for fun stuff
* $50 for emergencies

The goal isn’t perfection. It’s awareness. When you know where your money’s going, it’s easier to make smart choices.

# 3. Don’t Miss Out on Student Discounts

Seriously, student discounts in Australia are gold. Always keep your student ID handy—it can save you money on travel, movies, clothes, and even meals.

Websites like **UNiDAYS** or **Student Edge** have deals for almost everything. And your university often runs free events or workshops with food included (never say no to free pizza). Little savings here and there really add up over time.

# 4. Cook More, Order Less

This one’s simple but powerful. Eating out every other day can crush your budget before you know it. Cooking at home is cheaper and, let’s be honest, usually healthier too.

Try meal prepping once or twice a week. Even basic dishes—like pasta or stir-fry—can last for days. And if you share meals or groceries with friends or roommates, it cuts costs even more.

# 5. Keep an Eye on Your Spending

Tracking your spending doesn’t mean you need to write down every coffee purchase (unless you want to). But do check where your money goes once a week.

There are free apps like **Pocketbook** or **Frollo** that connect to your bank account and do the tracking for you. Or, if you’re old school, just jot things down in a notebook. The point is to catch small habits that drain your money—like late-night food delivery or unnecessary subscriptions.

# 6. Find Cheaper Accommodation Options

Rent eats up a big chunk of any student’s budget. If you can, look for shared housing or student accommodation. Living a bit farther from campus can be cheaper, though make sure the transport costs don’t ruin the savings.

Websites like **Flatmates** and **Gumtree** are good places to start. Talk to seniors or classmates—they often know affordable and safe places nearby.

# 7. Save a Bit, Even if It’s Small

It’s easy to say “I’ll save later,” but starting small now is better than waiting. Even $10 or $20 a week goes a long way when something unexpected happens—like a broken laptop or sudden travel cost.

Set up a separate savings account. That way, you’re less tempted to spend it.

# 8. Pick Up a Part-Time Job or Side Gig

Most students in Australia work part-time, and it’s a great way to manage expenses. Jobs in retail, cafes, tutoring, or even freelance gigs can help you earn some extra money.

Websites like **Seek** and **Indeed** post student-friendly jobs daily. Just make sure you balance your work hours with your study load—you don’t want to burn out.

# 9. Be Real About Social Spending

This one’s tough. Australia has a lively social scene, and it’s easy to get caught up in it. You don’t have to say no to everything, but be selective. Maybe skip one night out and instead plan a cheap movie night with friends. Small swaps like that make a big difference over time.

# 10. Review and Adjust

Your budget won’t stay perfect forever. Expenses change—maybe your rent increases or your job hours decrease. So, review your budget every month or two. Adjust what needs changing and move on. Budgeting is more about staying aware than following strict rules.

# Final Thoughts

Budgeting isn’t about cutting all the fun from your life—it’s about knowing where your money goes and making it work for you. Start small, be consistent, and don’t beat yourself up if you slip once in a while.

University life in Australia can be expensive, but with a bit of planning, you can manage it without too much stress. And if academics ever get overwhelming, you can always get expert help with your studies.

It’s all about balance—spend smart, study smart, and enjoy the ride.",0,1761535000.0,AusFinance,6,0.14,False

Math teachers learning style doesn't match what I need

School motivation and grades

I got into 9th grade this year (first year of highschool in canada anyway) and I need help with advice on motivation and such. This may come off as a vent, but it is not and I just need advice.

My math teacher (not intentional, this just keeps happening) keeps going up a year with me, and for 3 years including this one, shes been my math teacher. Her teaching style is read off a slideshow for 50 minutes that she didn't even make thats impossible to pay attention to the whole time, give you a 4 page worksheet to finish in 15 minutes, (I have adhd and suck at math, so this can be a struggle) and review it. As said prior, I have adhd (and an iron deficiency, which isn't as big of a deal but impacts my motivation even more) and I need advice for studying, attention span, and getting better grades. The BEST final grade I've gotten from her class is 80% last year, and its too late (You can only transfer in the first two weeks which is INSANE cause I was sick lots of the second week but whatever.) Motivation also falls flat cause the class is full of people I hate. The only thing keeping me together in math is anger, spite, and coffee. Anyways, ignore my tangent, I really need advice on this.

My biggest issue is around the weeks before, during, and continuing into now is something new as far as symptoms go, which is I simply cannot stay awake. I’m up for around 4-6 hours, then sleep, wake up, continue. This is playing hell on the hours I need to be awake for, which is prime-time EST timings. Instead, I’m asleep every evening and morning, awake briefly in the afternoon, then again at around 1:00 AM.

And it’s a strong sleep urge too; normally I can fight it off with coffee or pop, but this is less than 10 minutes of warning and I’m out like a light. 

This is more “inconvenient” than bad, really, as I’m not working. But I’m missing when my friends are awake, and I’m waking up so tired I could nap immediately after. Weirdly, in a way, I do feel…better, ish, for the extra sleep. But not enough to meaningfully do anything. 

I’ve had a sleep study done with no conclusive results. And going to the emergency is right out, as my emergency room in Canada often is either overloaded or closed, and lacks the ability to help me short term anyways. I’ll bring it up with my clinic next I see them, but I’m not sure what to even bring up with them?

Narcolepsy seems to be “too serious” to be what this is, and I don’t necessarily want to collect diagnoses like Pokemon cards. But is there anything I should be looking into? Tips to stay awake?",1,1761534528.0,covidlonghaulers,2,1.0,False

I was tired of people peeking at my screen in coffee shops or on the train/plane? So I took matter in my own hands and I just dropped the beta for iSee, a super lightweight macOS menu bar app that uses your MacBook's camera to alert you the instant an unauthorized person is looking over your shoulder.



Why only for Mac?  
I wanted to learn Swift by making something cool and plus wanted to unleash by urge to perform vibe coding 😅 and plus which could help me connect with other developers who love making apps for Mac and iPhone why? its fun to explore new things and learn from different folks in the same field.😃🥳



The best part? It's built with a privacy-first approach: it's 100% open source and runs all detection on your device-zero data ever leaves your Mac.

So if there is any contributors or developers and could provide a honest feedback for the app it would really mean a lot as I want to make it free and open source for ever if possible which currently it is.



✨ Key Features in iSee's Beta V1.0.0:

👁️ Real-Time Detection: Instant alerts using Apple's Vision framework.

🚨 Long-Term Threat Detection: The menu bar icon turns red if the shoulder surfer persists for over a minute.

💻 Dynamic Island Magic: It integrates beautifully into your MacBook's notch area, showing the camera feed there with liquid-smooth, matte-black animations. It looks native!

🔒 Pure Privacy: Zero data collection and on-device processing guarantee your confidentiality.

🎨 Clean Interface: Minimal menu bar integration and auto-dismissing notification overlays.



So do give it a try and let me know your feedback! The universal DMG is available on the releases page.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of contradictions: the **Philadelphia 76ers**, a team with a 2-0 start but an offense that’s slower than a snail in a marathon, host the **Orlando Magic**, a squad that’s 1-2 but somehow even more likely to shoot a 3-pointer than make one. Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat head and the wit of a late-night host.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Real Favorite?

The odds are as clear as a postgame press conference without a mic. The **Magic** are the slight favorites, with implied probabilities hovering around **60%** (thanks to decimal odds like 1.6), while the **76ers** sit at roughly **40%** (decimal odds \~2.4). The spread is a tight **-3.5 for Orlando**, suggesting bookmakers expect a narrow Magic victory. But here’s the twist: Philadelphia’s defense is so porous, they’d let a toddler in a wheelchair score 20 points. Last season, they allowed **115.8 points per game** (21st in the NBA), and Orlando’s offense? Well, they shot **31.8% from deep last season**—which is about the same chance I have of napping without my coffee.

### News Digest: Injuries, Ankle-Breakers, and a Coach’s Plea

**Philadelphia’s** key injuries: **Paul George** (knee) and **Jared McCain** (thumb) are out, while **Trendon Watford** (hamstring) is day-to-day. But hey, the 76ers have thrived without George so far—Tyrese Maxey’s been a scoring machine (28 points in their last game), and Joel Embiid’s been efficient, even if his shot selection sometimes resembles a dartboard.

**Orlando’s** woes are more dire. **Jalen Suggs** and **Moritz Wagner** are day-to-day with knee issues, which is tragic because Suggs is the only Magic player who can dribble without looking like a penguin on a trampoline. Their latest loss to the Bulls? A masterclass in inefficiency: **12.5% from 3-point range**, **20 turnovers**, and a coach,

30M — pediatric nurse, construction business owner, immigrant with no family in the U.S. Six years of dating, 50+ first dates, 80% rejection. Tried everything: clothes, confidence, hobbies, date variety, self-improvement. Always get told “you’re great, just no spark.” Confidence is shot. Wondering if I should keep trying or accept that maybe I’m not meant for this and build a life on my own. I’ve heard “someone’s out there for you” for a decade, but reality hasn’t matched that line.

⸻

Hey everyone,
I’m honestly confused about why dating has been so hard and wondering if anyone else is going through something similar.

I’m a 30-year-old pediatric nurse and construction business owner. I’ve been actively dating for 6 years, mostly through Hinge, and I’ve had over 50 first-date fails. About 80% of the time I get rejected, and I’ve rejected the other 20% (mostly because people didn’t look like their pictures).

I’m 5’8”, 155 lbs, fairly athletic, social, and yeah — a little weird, but I own it. I love outdoor and extreme sports. I’m not a model, but not unattractive either. I’ve felt mutual physical attraction plenty of times.

I’m also an immigrant from Europe with no family in the U.S., so finding a partner has always felt like something more than just romance — it’s about building a life and a sense of belonging.

The biggest issue seems to be confidence. After so many rejections, mine’s basically wrecked. I can fake it at first, but eventually it cracks and the girl usually gets “the ick.” I’ve even asked what went wrong after dates, and the answer is almost always the same:

“You’re great, I just didn’t feel a spark.”

I’ve genuinely tried everything I can think of:
	•	Upgrading my style and grooming
	•	Learning to dance
	•	Planning different kinds of dates (walks, climbing, haunted houses, ice skating, coffee, etc.)
	•	Paying for everything
	•	taking things slow or being more quick to intimacy 
	•	Improving my conversation flow, dating YouTube videos 

Some girls have literally described their “ideal guy” and it sounded like me. I’ve also been told I look better in person than in pictures. Still — nothing sticks.

I’ve started to wonder if it’s just my personality. I can be hyper and intense, and while I try to dial it back, it eventually comes through. Being “fully myself” hasn’t worked. Im more of an anxious attachment style person aswell.

My standards aren’t crazy — someone active, physically fit(ish), ideally a bit shorter than me. But after years of trying, I’ve heard “someone’s out there for you” more times than I can count… and a decade later, I’m still alone.

At this point, I’m asking:
Do I keep trying? Change something major? Get a coach? Or accept that maybe I’m not cut out for relationships? I’ve seen what happens to lonely single men as they age, and honestly I’d rather die climbing or paragliding than live that kind of isolated, bitter life.

Any real advice would be appreciated.
I just want to know if all the effort I’m putting into dating is actually worth it — or if after this much rejection, I’m basically cooked. I don’t want to give up, but if the reality is that I’m not built for this or it’s just not going to happen, then I’d rather stop trying to shape my life around the idea of a relationship.

If that’s the case, I’ll focus on building a life for me, my dog, and the outdoors — something that doesn’t make me feel like I’m constantly failing at something I can’t win. It’s not what I hoped for, but maybe it’s the hand I’ve been dealt.",1,1761534303.0,dating_advice,11,1.0,False

Wanted to give a rundown of details for other parents looking to vacation. 

Cities visited: Beijing —> Xi’an —> Chengdu —> Chongqing —> Shanghai (one night)

Our general days looked like early hotel breakfast, walking and excursions with kiddo taking a nap in the carrier from 10-11:30ish, lunch, more touring, back to the hotel for second nap from 3-4:30, evening touring and dinner, baby bedtime routine and then audiobooks and hotel amenities til adult bedtime. It’s humbling how much less you can do while traveling with a baby, but all of it was magical and we still got about 20k steps and 8ish hours of touring/travel per day.

General tips:
- I’ll leave details on apps, vpns, esims etc to those who are more experienced than us. We pretty exclusively relied on Alipay and Amap (with an occasion WeChat assist) the entire trip and it works great.
- If you’re looking for baby care products (wipes, diapers, etc), most bougier malls will have a store that has those somewhere (goodbaby, large grocery stores, purcotton in a pinch). You also can search “maternal and baby” on Amap 
- If you rely on a stroller, make sure it’s one you can lift easily. While some city areas have a lot of accessible entrances and ramps, many don’t (and rarely, even subway entrances don’t). So be ready to fold and lift.
- For cars, book DiDi premium to avoid the cigarette smell you’ll likely find in a standard DiDi.
- We avoided tour groups and are very thankful we did. I’ve never been a fan but with a kid we COULD NOT be on someone else’s schedule. Being able to leave/stop to nurse/just sit down at any point was necessary.

Hotels: our general thought for hotels is GET A NICE ONE if you’re with a baby. You’ll need the comfortable space for relaxation, naps, and comfort. And you’ll want to spend the extra money to not have a place that smells like smoke. We didn’t used to be breakfast people before having our son, but we almost always used the morning breakfast at places because our kiddo is a BIG EATER and needed a big meal to start the day. 

- Beijing Chao Sanlitun: Super nice, the beds were so damn comfortable and they gave us a free upgrade to the room. It had the best food on the trip and I looked forward to breakfast every morning.

- Xi’an Canopy Hilton: The location is phenomenal, truly out of this world. Best location of the trip. The breakfast is good but a comedown after Beijing. Offered us a free stroller. 

- Chengdu Upper House (FKA Temple House): we felt like we were in a white lotus, which was… an experience. It was probably the best hotel I’ve stayed in my life and maybe best I’ll ever stay in. Ridiculous location, insanely nice room and amenities (oatly in the minibar???) Truly, outrageously nice. The food wasn’t quite as good as I’d expect though! Offered us a free stroller and crib. 

- Chongqing Niccolo: Get a room with a view!!! It’s outrageous! We were in a room with the river view and we’d just sit there at night staring at the city. It was insane. Also, the breakfast was the closest to being as good as Beijing. Offered us a free stroller and crib. 

- Shanghai Banyan tree on the Bund: maybe the nicest room (tied with Chengdu) but there was a vague cigarette smell. A shame, but it was only for a night. This would be an amazing place to stay as a couple I think! It’s super romantic, had a lovely spa, and the giant jacuzzi tub is amazing (also fun for the kiddo).

 City review:

Beijing: So much to see and do here! We carried our kid the whole time and are glad we did, there were too many old roads and stairs for us to want to use a stroller. We did the Mutianyu Great Wall by booking a DiDi to and from and had a really nice time. Go early though! It started absolutely filling up by the time we left lunch. We also did the forbidden city and it was an insane experience, albeit a bit rushed from our son getting some sensory overload near the end. I had the most fun here the day we did a bit of a self led walking tour from the lama Temple all the way to Jingshan park (like 30k steps, be warne!). There were so many fun temples, the imperial college, beautiful quiet streets, and parks on the way. My husband really loved wandering the hutongs.

Xi’an: staying in the Everbright City really colored our experience and we loved it. The Muslim quarter was my husbands favorite experience in China, and the food in Xi’an was my favorite of the trip. It was a pretty flat and easy with a stroller, and we really enjoyed climbing some of the towers and visiting old temples and the parks here. Our son loved the shows at Tang Paradise!

Chengdu (note- my husband was sick day two): despite the illness, this was our favorite city of the trip. We love casual wandering of beautiful neighborhoods, and Chengdu has that in excess. The Yulin and Fangcao neighborhoods were beautiful. It felt similar to wandering west Tokyo, slow placed, lovely, hanging out with kids who tried to teach our kid Chinese and drinking coffee in nice cafes. We didn’t see the pandas because that was our day two plan. We also loved the peoples park and surrounding areas. This city was super child friendly, the hot pot was amazing, I would definitely go back

Chongqing: (note- kiddo got sick day two) stunning city. If you’re comfortable carrying your kid around (It’s a VERY vertical city), Chongqing is so much fun! We were all mesmerized by the architecture and lights and we had amazing food here. I loved Xiahaoli in the morning, and we all really loved the night we stayed up and walked across the bridge to see Hongyadong (tip, start from the top and walk on the walkways in Daijia Alley to get a view of the area from above, then walk across the bridge away from Hongyadong bridge to get the bridge views, then get on the subway at grand Theater. Avoid the MASSIVE crowd at the bottom of the area)

Shanghai: I don’t feel like I can give a review since we were only here for a day! But it felt the most “western” of any cities we were in. 

“Mistakes”: some of these were outside our control. 

- We got sick on the second leg of the trip in sequence and it severely limited what we were up to do in Chengdu and Chongqing and I wish we could’ve seen and done more. Not a mistake, just unfortunate timing
- We were locked out of a lot of Chinese apps (delivery apps, food apps etc) because of our lack of Chinese number. Our phones are locked and not paid off so this wasn’t an options
- Bringing a portable car seat. I’m torn on this one. It was nice to have for some long DiDi rides, but we ended up not using it all the time and people in china don’t seem to use them really ever. Plus lugging it on trains SUCKED. But we saw multiple car crashes on the second half of our trip and started thinking “thank god we had him in a car seat”.

Real and (less real) Struggles
- Smoking. It’s everywhere. I got more second hand smoke on this trip than I have in my entire life. Waiting in the DiDi waiting area at Beijing airport was a special hell. I get headaches from cigarettes and was a headachy mess from time to time worrying about the impact on our kiddo.
- People getting handsy with baby. Our baby is white passing and people were obsessed with him. Waving hi or taking pictures is one thing but random people would try and pick up our kid out of our arms, grab him or kiss him. I’m all for cultural differences, but not for me looking away for one second and some stranger trying to grab our kid out of their stroller.
- Hot indoor spaces. We’re from a cold region and are used to indoor spaces being a bit cool. That is NOT the case in China. Cars, malls, any indoor space- hot! Lots of sweating and occasional overheating from kiddo (plus panic from older folks about us having him in tshirts and shorts)
- Aggressiveness on transit. Gosh people seem to be in a rush. Getting shoved, pushed, cut in line, etc just became a daily experience and it was pretty intense
- Things seem to open pretty late. Multiple times we found all the coffee shops around us didn’t open til 10. I used to be a late riser before I had a kid but that’s not possible anymore. Hence, hotel breakfasts were nice.

Pleasant surprises:
- The country in general feels very baby friendly, especially compared to some US cities. Most restaurants had baby chairs, some even had bibs and plates or brought us out little snacks for the kid. It was a pleasant surprise just having so many resources for the kid.
- The malls are absolutely insane. I just couldn’t believe some of the luxury in shopping spaces we passed through. Most amenities I could hope for from the US were available there if you looked (and way more we don’t have)
- Alipay being ubiquitous everywhere is amazing. Alipay’s also integrating all transit passes is wonderful
- We don’t speak any Chinese and got on absolutely fine with the help of google translate and some pointing and nodding on my part.



TLDR: visiting China with a kid is a blast! I highly recommend it, just be prepared to have a nice home base and to carry your kid a lot!",7,1761534298.0,travelchina,3,1.0,False

Like asking if I have any mutual interests or asking if I want to go get a coffee or something  somewhere.

One of the times I accepted I felt like the interaction was going in the direction of dating so I set a boundary.

I am really protective of my own self development and mental health treatment and with High Spectrum Aspergers, Childhood Trauma and Bipolar Depression and have devoted a lot of my life to being compliant with treatment and am in the infancy stages of living a independent financially stable life.

Working a pretty good first PT job for a 20 year old albeit not performing well tbh.

Not spending all or half of the weekly savings I have, though I could do better.

Hanging out with friends + life skills/networking.

I need to perform better with full medication intake consistency and that is one major factor why I refuse to date for a long period of time, because simply I am not ready and that would be irresponsible on my end.

I just don’t think I will be ready at least for a few years to handle and properly reciprocate such a relationship, I just feel like a jerk and embarrassed for saying “Sorry I am not mature or ready enough for a significant relationship beyond friendship”

I know a lot of people my age in the US with similar realities or not struggle with housing and a lot of factors of living.

I won’t beat myself up over it, but at a certain point I will be past the beginning of my 20s.

Does anyone think I made a mistake and if so how can I improve with setting boundaries while still being open to dating in the far future.

Or if I am totally wrong and being too punitive and self deprecating + wasting my early adulthood away.

1oh3q94,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oh3q94/i_52m_got_confirmation_my_wife_56f_was_cheating/,I (52m) got confirmation my wife (56f) was cheating on me around twenty years ago. Should it influence my decision/plans now?,"Firstly, ill apologize for the structure and grammar of this post. English is my first language and im just bad at it. Its also probably pretty long. I have no idea how to get to the point. This is a throwaway for the usual reasons. 

My wife Claire (not her real name) and I met in on a random night out, in a busy London bar when I was 24 and she 28. The attraction was immediate and we became a couple very quickly. We didnt use the word exclusive, but in the late 90's, I didnt know of anyone that had to label relationships like that. We had moved in together in to a new rental flat ten months later.  The sexual chemistry was amazing and we were loving life. 

Claire had a lively personality (im being careful of which words I use to avoid recognition by family or friends), fairly loud and the life of the party. I am no shrinking violet and am quite poplar and chatty.

Fast forward to now. We have teenage daughters and have been married for over twenty years, pets and a almost finished the mortgage.

Recently I bumped into a former co-worker and best friend of Claires named Jayne. Jayne used to sit across form Claire at work and they were friends outside of work as well. Now Claire does seem to have friends for a few years and then fall out or just drift away from them. Even when they seemed to be BFF at one time. Jayne (48f) was her bestie back then. Jayne and I had always gotten on, and openly jokingly flirted. She would make suggestive comments and do other things to try to embarrass me, particularly in front of Claire who thought it was hilarious.  I was handsome, tall enough (6'1"") and athletic and girls tended to like a lot about me.

Jayne and I hadn't seen each other for maybe fifteen years. We were in the town center and immediately started joking and having a laugh, falling into our familiar banter. We went for a coffee as we were literally standing outside a branch of a well known coffee chain.

We had a catch up and she then suddenly says she is glad we met again, as something has always bothered her. She wanted to know why I never made a move on her given she lay it all out so many times, she knew I fancied her a bit. I explained I found her attractive but I was with Claire and wouldn't cheat. Jayne frowned and said that I deserved, and could do so much better, and 'they' (the other girlfriends in their group at the time) all thought id eventually dump Claire, given she was a cheater. 

I was startled. I asked her to tell me why she said that. Jayne seemed shocked I reacted confused. She told me she assumed I must have known but forgiven or something as Claire was not great at covering things up. She then apologised she never told me, but it never occurred to her I didnt know something, but surely I was suspicious as Claire had a four year affair with her boss for one.  

To be fair, as the words came out of Jaynes mouth, loads of things clicked into place. I felt such an idiot. Things that if I tried to write down here now would be obvious to you reading, but just seemed explained by Claires narrative back then. I Just believed the best at every turn.  I now know what sometimes didnt feel right, was my intuition screaming at me from the next room where Claire had manipulated me over the years, into locking it away. A lot of this was the vail of sex. She was insatiable, fun and sexy, and initiated constantly. I was thinking with my cock along with all the other manipulation.

I asked Jayne for some more details to match my recollection. It apparently started shortly after Claire started working at that company. He was a charismatic but arrogant arsehole (I know as I met him several times, I didnt like him)  and despite having a family, was known to have been with several other co-workers under him. This was about two years before Claire and I got married and what hurt more was apparently it continued almost as soon as we got back from our honeymoon, and went on for another two years until the boss moved away to Canada with his family. 

Jayne didnt want to say too much more, as it had clearly had an effect on me. Apparently it wasn't every day or even every week Claire cheated, but it was fairly frequent. Jayne also intimated on girls nights out Claire would have a few drinks and sometimes go further than a girlfriend/wife should with some random guy (Kissing and groping).

Now thinking back, there were a few red flags long before this affair. A couple of things that stayed in my mind, but I had no reason to treat as more than me being suspicious unnecessarily. 

Overall, my question isnt was I stupid or just the subject of deceit and gaslighting, but does it matter now.

I have no reason to suspect anything happened after that affair ended. We had kids pretty quickly after that time. They are absolutely mine, no doubt about it. Claire changed over the years. Ironically we now have ended up in basically a dead bedroom (post menopause she is basically asexual she thinks) and things might end for that and various other reasons. 

Im debating if this twenty year old betrayal should be a factor in my current thinking about my marriage, or just base my decisions on things as they are now? 



  
tl;dr  I (52m) met an old friend, and found out my wife (56f) did cheat on me a lot around twenty years ago and quite possibly before that. My marriage might end soon, I dont know if something from so long ago, however difficult, should be a factor in my decision. ",59,1761534185.0,relationship_advice,83,0.88,False

**1. know your boundaries before you start**  
don’t wait until you’re in a session to figure out what’s okay and what’s not. write your rules down and say them clearly. for me it’s: no kissing, no touching under clothes, and sessions stop immediately if i feel uncomfortable. saying no doesn’t make you rude it makes you professional.

**2. screen people properly**  
the app i use (youlink) verifies IDs. i always meet new clients in a public spot first, like a park or coffee shop. you can tell a lot about someone in the first 5 minutes.

**3. emotional control is everything**  
this isn’t just “lay there and cuddle.” you’re managing someone’s emotions while keeping your own steady. some ppl open up about their lives, some cry, some just want silence. you have to stay calm and centered no matter what. it’s weirdly draining sometimes.

**4. hygiene + environment matter a lot**  
you’re in close contact, so show up clean and put together. bring a fresh blanket, sanitizer, mint/gum, maybe a light body spray (nothing strong). clients notice small stuff. clean energy = repeat bookings.

**5. treat it like a real job**  
be on time. keep notes on regulars. track your hours and income. follow up professionally. the people who make real money at this are the ones who treat it like work, not a quick hustle. if you’re good at it, you can easily pull $600–$800 a week without killing yourself with hours.

honestly, it’s not for everyone. it takes patience, people skills, and thick skin. but if you’re grounded and know how to create a calm vibe, it’s a legit way to earn.

1oh3mpy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh3mpy,[Build In Public] Turning an N8N Workflow to a fully functional Ai Application for,"Hello again! Wanted to share some Ai learnings.

For the past few weeks, I’ve been using my own app called ResiboKo, a dead-simple, AI-powered way to track everyday spends without spreadsheets. AND REALLY PROUD HOW USEFUL IT HAS BECOME!

This was inspired by an n8n workflow from one of my friends who shared it to me coz i had problems tracking my expenses. The workflow works but I felt there is so much frictions like configuring TG, postgress memory, database storage etc. WHAT IF I can tranform the workflow into a fully functional application?

sooo. through a mix of n8n workflows + vibe coding sessions + Google Studio + Firebase.

And it works. Like… it actually works.

The Problem that I have and maybe you also have is..

probably you always wanted to “track expenses.” Then life happens...ride fare, lunch outs, Grab home, coffee break.The receipts disappear, or never existed. LOL maybe buried under your bag too. And you and I forget everything by the time we get home.

The Pivot...

So I built ResiboKo to track how we actually spend.

* Snap, type, upload or talk and then forget it.
* The AI logs, categorizes, and builds a money story for your week.
* No spreadsheets, no wallet hoarding, no guilt.

This week I added the “Cash Leak Finder.” That feature now shows you where you're leaking $$$ every week. And then Ai suggests saving opportunities where potentially the money could be put to better use and work for you. It’s lowkey one of my favorites.

If you're building workflows with n8n, try making a mini app with it. I tell you it totally works. Takes time but it works. So far, I have 3 beta users including myself. hahahahha!

NEXT CHALLENGE - How To Find Users. HAHAHA!

1oh3m14,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1oh3m14/my_christian_parents_are_adamant_that_my/,My Christian Parents are Adamant That My Relationship Won’t Last,"A little bit of context: I’m in my early twenties, I was raised in a Christian home, I used to believe in god wholeheartedly, used to be in the music ministry— I was in deep. It’s been roughly two years since I denounced my faith and stopped going to church all together. I still live with my parents (Christians) and they’ve known that I don’t believe in god ever since then. 

During that time frame after I denounced my faith, I met my boyfriend who is also an atheist. Our relationship is wonderful and we are both dating to marry, so we’ve always thought of our relationship as long term. My parents do like him a lot, despite the language barrier between them. They constantly mention how hard-working and respectful he is. They say he is a good man, and he really is. 

The issue for them is that he is not Christian. Last night we were having coffee and just talking around the dinner table, when the topic of church was brought up. My mom asked my boyfriend if he believed in god, which he said “no” to. He told them he hadn’t gone to church in years, and that he simply doesn’t believe. My parents did not look pleased at all, and said “thats’s just not right” in Spanish. And then my dad went on to me about how my relationship with him will not work out long term because he’s not Christian, and that one day I will return to god and be born again, and mentioned that he had been right about it before. 

I’ve had one boyfriend before my current one. He had also been atheist, but I was Christian at the time. Our different beliefs may have been part of the reason we broke up, but I know for sure it was not the *whole* reason. During that relationship my father would constantly tell me he wasn’t the one for me and that we would break up because god has a different man for me. When we did break up, he would give me small speeches about how he knew all along and how he was always right, that I was going to marry a godly man. 

It breaks my heart to hear my parents talk about my current relationship this way. Yes they get along with my boyfriend, they like him, again, they think he’s a great man… but in the end,  they aren’t taking our relationship seriously simply because they genuinely believe god is going to “save me” and that he has another plan for my life. It breaks my heart to hear from the people I love most that my relationship basically doesn’t mean anything because it’s “going to pass”, that these deep feelings and this special connection I have with my boyfriend is only temporary in the grand scheme of things because *god* is “in control”. I love my boyfriend with every cell of my body, he’s my best friend, he’s my soulmate. I would never change him for anything in the world. I feel that we understand each other completely, and from the way we have gotten to know each other, I am confident that we are compatible in many aspects of life. I want nothing more but to spend the rest of my life with him, and we are both actively working towards getting married in the next 1-3 years. 

I want to have a healthy relationship with my parents, and I want us to continue to be in harmony even after I am married. But I really don’t see how this is going to be possible when this is the mindset they have. Will they constantly be against my relationship? Against my marriage? Will they always give me speeches about how I’m doing the wrong thing by being with my man simply because he doesn’t believe in god? Because they belive I will change? Will they always see him as below themselves? 

I’m sorry this was long. I tried looking at maybe similar stories to read up on some advice but I couldn’t really find any. I guess I just want some advice on how to deal with my parents and their comments. How can I make them take my relationship seriously? How can I still maintain a good relationship with them? Does it ever get better?

I would also love to hear stories of those of you who might’ve been in the same position as me, but who made it and are living happily with their partners. I guess I just feel that I need some support in a way. Thank you to all who can offer any advice or words of encouragement. I really appreciate it all.

Recently I went out with my partner, we had a nice meal with apps, mains. I decided to get a tea and some dessert after as there were about 5 people waiting. My partner thinks that once you have finished your meal, you should pay, and you should pretty much leave right away. Otherwise, you're taking up a table the staff could serve. I get the perspective that ordering just a few items and holding up a table for an extra 20 minutes is not as profitable for the restaurant nor the servers.

However, I'm not camping with a coffee and my laptop my whole time there. We order a proper meal and tip generously. I won't linger if it's near closing or the staff is giving the ""are you done yet"" look. If there are just a few people waiting, I will make sure to at least get a coffee or dessert after my meal. If there is a hoarde of customers, I will leave.

I got into 9th grade this year (first year of highschool in canada anyway) and I need help with advice on motivation and such. This may come off as a vent, but it is not and I just need advice.

My math teacher (not intentional, this just keeps happening) keeps going up a year with me, and for 3 years including this one, shes been my math teacher. Her teaching style is read off a slideshow for 50 minutes that she didn't even make thats impossible to pay attention to the whole time, give you a 4 page worksheet to finish in 15 minutes, (I have adhd and suck at math, so this can be a struggle) and review it. As said prior, I have adhd (and an iron deficiency, which isn't as big of a deal but impacts my motivation even more) and I need advice for studying, attention span, and getting better grades. The BEST final grade I've gotten from her class is 80% last year, and its too late (You can only transfer in the first two weeks which is INSANE cause I was sick lots of the second week but whatever.) Motivation also falls flat cause the class is full of people I hate. The only thing keeping me together in math is anger, spite, and coffee. Anyways, ignore my tangent, I really need advice on this. Should I try to get my parents to email the school and hope they give in?

1oh3l7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1oh3l7p/i_chose_myself_for_my_daughter/,I chose myself for my daughter.,"I’ve been married for a year, and we have a two-year-old daughter. Last night, I decided to end my relationship with my husband because I feel he doesn’t understand where he went wrong or how his actions have affected me and our family.

When I gave birth, I was in a public hospital during the height of COVID. No one was allowed to accompany me, even after delivery. I had a C-section and stayed in the hospital for five days — three days on bed rest and two days to recover. During that time, we were already having issues because he often got impatient whenever I asked for help or needed something.

After giving birth, he was there for a while, but a few months later, he started spending more and more time outside. He would always be out with his friends or working part-time at night, but I never saw any extra money coming in. Since our finances were tight, I was forced to go back to work even though I had stopped working during my pregnancy.

We agreed on an amount that he would contribute monthly, but he often told me at the last minute that he couldn’t give the full amount. That caused a lot of arguments because I already had our budget planned. I couldn’t understand why he didn’t have enough money despite all his supposed part-time jobs.

He also spends too much time with his friends. Whenever I bring it up, he says, “So what if I’m with my friends while you’re sleeping?” He doesn’t see anything wrong with it. I also found out that less than 12 hours after I gave birth, he went out to attend a birthday party. When I confronted him, he said there was nothing wrong with it because it was “just lunch,” and that I was overreacting.

Aside from that, he often gaslights me and invalidates what I say. For example, if a mutual friend tells me something and I bring it up, he immediately insists it’s wrong — even if he wasn’t there. He constantly makes me feel like my thoughts and opinions don’t matter, and it’s always as if I’m the one who’s mistaken or unreasonable.

He also tends to ignore our daughter. Most of the time, when she tries to talk to him, he’s focused on his phone and doesn’t respond right away. I usually have to tell him, “Your daughter is talking to you,” before he looks up. He treats me the same way — he rarely listens when I speak, and I always feel dismissed.

At night, he also shows a lack of respect. He works on the night shift, but whenever he has free time, he spends it playing computer games. He’s often very loud, even when I’m resting or when our daughter is asleep. We’ve talked about it several times, and he promises to change, but he always goes back to the same behavior.

I know that I also have some shortcomings. For example, he sometimes asks me to make him coffee when he wakes up, but it’s hard for me to do that because when he’s awake, I’m already at work — or sometimes, he’s already out with his friends. He also complains that there’s no food, but most of the time, he wastes food because he chooses to eat outside with his friends instead of at home.

There was also a time when he was sick, and I admit I wasn’t able to take care of him that much. But part of me still felt hurt remembering that when I was the one in the hospital recovering from childbirth, he went out to attend a birthday party. He also says that I don’t support him in playing basketball, but it’s hard to do that when he chooses to play even when our daughter was in the emergency room — simply because he already told his friends that he would join the game.

Overall, I feel emotionally drained and unappreciated. I’ve tried to understand him and communicate many times, but he continues to invalidate my feelings, neglect our child, and disrespect our home.

Now, I’m choosing myself — not out of selfishness, but for my daughter. I would rather have her grow up in an incomplete family than in a dysfunctional one. I don’t want her to grow up seeing me slowly lose myself, or watching her father be emotionally absent. She deserves to see a mother who is at peace and a home where love and respect are present — even if that means it’s just the two of us for now.",3,1761533760.0,family,2,1.0,False

1oh3gqa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc0OsOWuBHc,[GUIDE] All the Ways to Turn On Noise Cancellation on Your AirPods Pro (for iPhone and Android),"**IMPORTANT: Active Noise Cancellation is only available on AirPods Pro and AirPods Max.** This feature does not exist on standard AirPods (1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation).

If you own a pair of AirPods Pro, one of their best features is **Active Noise Cancellation**, which uses microphones to detect and block out external sounds, letting you focus on your music, podcast, or phone call. But how do you actually turn it on?

This guide will show you all the ways to **enable AirPods Pro noise cancelling**, whether you're using an iPhone, iPad, or even an Android device. Let's dive in and block out the world.

# Why Use Active Noise Cancellation?

* **Focus:** It's perfect for noisy offices, commutes, or coffee shops, allowing you to concentrate without distractions.
* **Immersive Audio:** By reducing background noise, you can hear the details in your music and podcasts more clearly, even at lower volumes.
* **Travel:** It's a game-changer for flights and train rides, significantly reducing engine drone and cabin noise.

# Watch Our Video Guide!

There are a few different ways to enable this feature. Watch our quick video tutorial to see all the methods in action, including the fastest way through Control Center.

>**Watch our step-by-step video guide on all the ways to turn on Noise Cancellation for your AirPods Pro!**

>[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc0OsOWuBHc**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc0OsOWuBHc)

# How to Turn On AirPods Noise Cancelling

Here are the main ways to control your listening modes.

# Method 1: The Fastest Way (Control Center on iPhone/iPad)

1. Wear your AirPods Pro.
2. Open **Control Center**:
   * On an iPhone with Face ID or an iPad: Swipe down from the top-right corner.
   * On an iPhone with a Home button: Swipe up from the bottom.
3. **Long-press the volume slider**. It looks like a speaker icon with a vertical bar.
4. A new menu will appear. Tap the **""Noise Control""** button on the bottom left.
5. Select **""Noise Cancellation.""** You can also choose ""Transparency"" (to hear your surroundings) or ""Off.""

# Method 2: Directly on Your AirPods Pro

You can cycle through noise control modes without even touching your phone.

1. Press and hold the **force sensor** (the indented part) on the stem of either the left or right AirPod.
2. You will hear a chime as it cycles between **Noise Cancellation** and **Transparency** mode.

# Method 3: From the Settings App (iPhone/iPad)

1. With your AirPods Pro connected, go to **Settings > Bluetooth**.
2. Find your AirPods Pro in the list and tap the **""i"" (info) icon** next to them.
3. Under the ""Noise Control"" section, you can select **""Noise Cancellation,""** ""Transparency,"" or ""Off.""

# Method 4: For Android Users

**How to enable noise cancelling on AirPods Pro with Android?** Since there is no Control Center or native settings menu, you must use the physical controls.

1. Connect your AirPods Pro to your Android device via Bluetooth settings.
2. Press and hold the **force sensor** on the stem of either AirPod to cycle between Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode. This is the only way to switch modes on Android without a third-party app.

1oh3fzi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh3fzi,End of October 2 nighter on Farm and Booth Lakes,"Got out for my last canoe trip of the season this past weekend.

I arrived at the Shall Lake parking lot around 4:30 Friday afternoon and got on the water soon after. I knew I’d be getting to the park late (for the end of October) so I opted to stay on Farm Lake. I got camp set up, and, having picked up a bag of fire wood on the way, night 1 was pretty easy. Intermittent drizzle and 2 degree temperatures didn’t dampen my spirits. I had a great meal and read by the fire until 10:45 when I turned in.

Morning was slow and peaceful. Colder weather means more elaborate meals, (being able to pack things like mayonnaise and sour cream without worrying about them going off) so scrambled omelette croissants we breakfast. More reading and coffee by the fire. The sun appeared briefly, but decided to hide again when I finally got out on the water.

My initial plan was to head to Godda Lake and do the loop, but when the forecast started  predicting sub zero mornings I decided to shorten the days, and opted for Booth Lake. Also, using Site Scout, I noticed that there was no one else booked for Booth, so I jumped on the opportunity to have the entire lake to myself (and my dog).

The trip there was fairly uneventful, with the exception of paddling through flurries on Booth. It was incredibly beautiful, the sun broke through for a few moments, the snow was falling and I was paddling along at a nice pace. The afternoon cleared, and we spent a few hours exploring Booth. 

A cooler night on Booth Lake, but I’d brought my long undies and layered up (t-shirt, long sleeve, wool button up, light sweater, wool sweater, jacket, toque and buff). So again, I was comfortable enough, sitting by the fire, reading until 11ish, when I finally called it a night. My -7 sleeping bag was just enough for night two, when it dipped down to about -3. I’m glad I filled my nalgene with hot water before getting into bed. 

This was the most silent trip I’ve ever done, and I’ve camped through every month of the year. There was little to no wind, so no lapping of water on the shore, no leaves in the trees, no insects, very few birds, and only the occasional squirrel chittering. It was a great chance to clear my head and enjoy the peace and solitude. And, a great chance to get the canoe out for it’s last trip of the year.",6,1761533312.0,algonquinpark,1,0.88,False

1oh3be1,https://i.redd.it/f1bigqgshkxf1.jpeg,If you’re a romance reader…,"…Rosewood is finally ready for visits!

Welcome to Rosewood—where every corner of this lively little island is inspired by romance novels! Start your journey in Contemporary Cove, where you might just experience your own meetcute while shopping, running errands, or sharing coffee with friends. 💖 Then breeze over the bridge into Rosebud Ranch and enjoy the quiet, softer amenities of the small town life. 🌾 Be careful trudging through Obsidian Overlook, though… There’s rumors masked men lurk in the forest and they’re waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. 👀 Not to worry, the gates of Academia Alcove are strong enough to keep them out, and once you’re in the courtyard, Kappa Phi and Chi Omega are waiting to usher you around the ACU campus and show you a good time—sorority style. 🥂 If you’re not too tired after a day in the greek life, you might just find yourself getting swept off your feet in Fantasy Falls. 💫 Word to the wise: there’s a wolf on the loose, especially during the full moon. 👀 From there, find the fork in the road and take a quick nap in the campgrounds of Wilderbrook Rest or follow the fork in the road into Seabreeze Shore, a quaint little coast town perfect for holidays featuring the Pink Flamingo Motel. 🌺 Don’t forget to stop by Ravenridge Ruins—it’s every goth’s dream! 🦇 Whether you’re craving sweet small-town charm, sizzling dark romance, or a magical fairytale escape, Rosewood brings your favorite romance book tropes to life—one corner of the island at a time.

Things to keep in mind when visiting:

⭐️ Player and villager house interiors are *not* yet decorated to fit the island theme.

⭐️ Beaches are not blocked off, but are not decorated. Only the front beaches have small decor. The backs are completely empty, so just keep on the path.

⭐️ For best experience, make a left when you exit Resident Services and follow the path. At the triple fork in the road, L will take you to the campsite, straight will bring you back to the front, and R will take you to cemetery.

⭐️ If you take any pictures, please tag me! I’d love to see them! ",11,1761532927.0,AnimalCrossingTours,6,1.0,False

I found him really smart and after our work he used to take me and his acquaintance ( let's call her R ) for coffee... He used to be really caring, would ask me if I reached home after work, would ask me if I had lunch/dinner, would make sure i ate something when work got stressful. I eventually started developing a crush on him. I used to leave tiny chits behind with pick up lines and he found it cute.. it went on and on.. and one day I had gone drinking with my friends and i asked him if he wanted to come too, he said he would come if I was alone. So he used to ask me regularly when we could meet... And during the last day of internship I told him we could meet only under one condition - I'm serious about this and i don't do anything casual -- i wrote this in a letter and gave it to him. So we agreed to meet. 
We met and he asked why I didn't ask him out before so I told him I thought he liked R. He said no, he only sees her as a friend and naturally they'll be close cause she's his acquaintance. I asked him if he liked me back to which he said he did and let's continue this. So for clarity I asked if we are dating to which he said he needs to think about it cause there is something bothering him. 
A week later we met again and he called me his girlfriend. The next 20 days were pure bliss, we met regularly, and he made a lot of promises ( "" I'll never leave you, I'm not going anywhere"" ""I'll never make you sad"" lol ) . And kept reassuring me that I don't need to worry about R ( should have thought about it then but nvm ) even without me asking about her. Then during the last date he said he felt I was more into this relationship than he is and told me that he feels like he didn't chase me to get me... Then he told me not to overthink about it. So I texted him too that I can't afford being sad again ( I didn't have a good childhood growing up ) if there's anything please tell but he said there's nothing to worry about.. we would talk 5 times a day and I'm not a calling person, and one day he even texted saying"" this is love"".. then one fine day, he ended things. We were supposed to exchange gifts then, and he got me a book and there was a letter attached to it which said how much he cant see this relationship go forward cause plot twist -- it's a one sided one because I'm the only one in love and he isn't in love with me cause he likes someone else -- I asked him if it was R.. he said yes. 
I fought with him a lot ( I'm known to have a soft spot on people ) and yet I fought with him. He dropped me home that day , said it's not right to leave me alone and go, but then when he came home, he told my mom - "" I don't like your daughter"".. He then proceeded to ask R out cause he said if R doesn't accept then we could get back together ( lol ) and I was in shock I didn't realise what was happening on that day i couldn't tell him "" as if i would get back with you "". The next day he asked R out and she said that her parents won't allow.. and he called me back asking "" how hard did you pray, she said no "". 
I then went there and ended things with him, tore and threw the letter he wrote and even then he was trying to say "" I like you but I liked her more , try understanding my pov "" ( lol again ) 
I then told him I need space. But he called me that night and said it's not fair cause he doesn't have anyone else to talk to other than me and R ... he then went through some personal shit and he was saying that he felt like he deserved whatever happened to him because of the way he treated me and wanted me to forgive him. And when I asked again if he liked me he said yes, and the reason why he wrote that he doesn't like me in the letter is so that i won't be like ""hey, let's work it out"". I don't know what to believe and i feel like I lack emotional clarity. I told him too that my friend said it looks like you tried hitting on other girls but the only reason you chose me is cause I'm naive and i flirted back... He got really defensive about it and in the end I had to apologise for it.
i have now gone no contact. Initial few days were hard...I'm not sad i lost him... I'm in a way happy that I got to know in the beginning cause we dated barely for 20 days. But I'm just sad about the whole reason for breakup... I feel like I was used, i feel like I was a distraction... And now I feel really sad.... And I feel like he never really saw my mind (obviously) 
And how do I overcome that ?

PS - after the break up he told that apparently he had asked R only if he should date me cause he told her "" I like someone else but L (me ) kind of asked me out what do I do ? "" To which R said "" you may not get the other person but you' might get L... So try it out "" and when we broke up she said "" you have so many fan girls, you can date anyone and proceed "" and hearing all that I told him that those comments are insensitive and I'm disappointed in her and told him never to date anyone else unless he gets over her completely if not her cause some of us put our entire heart into it . i then got her in my friends suggestion on insta and realised that she removed me and my best friend from her followers list. it kind of makes me feel sad that she removed me... But i feel like I did the right thing cause somethings had to be said ? And when I told him this he said that she can never do something like this... He always and always protects her and I'm done with this...",8,1761532811.0,TwoXIndia,10,0.79,False

I came here for my master’s; the first few years were all studies, friends, weekend drives. I wasn’t chasing relationships just building my life.

Lately, I’ve felt pulled toward something deeper: the kind of connection where you can talk about anything… or say nothing and still feel understood. I’m 5'5"", brown-skinned, calm, loyal, and low-drama. I’m not the loudest in the room; I’m the one who remembers how you take your coffee and checks if you got home safe.

1oh39qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonVineAustralia/comments/1oh39qq/the_best_and_the_worst_vine_acquisitions/,The best and the worst Vine acquisitions,"Given things have been relatively quiet on the drop front, I thought I'd simply toss this post out there as a 'musing' on my time with Vine. When I first started, there were over 7000+ items in the AI pool, somewhat less today !  I don't think we'll ever get some of the very expensive items I've seen the US Vine program has released, but I'm happy with where I'm at in the program.

I’ve been in the Vine program for 15 months.  In that time, I’ve ordered (as of today) 267 items.  Some of these have been good, some less so.  I’ve been fortunate in that I’ve generally ordered ‘stuff’ that I (or a family member) had a use for. There’s been lots of power banks and cables, a few desktop USB charging stations and 240V power boards in general. Everyone in the family now has a mobile phone holder for their cars, as well as screen protectors and covers for their phones.

I thought I’d throw this out there to see what are the best and the worst things you’ve received as a Viner.

The things I’ve loved most (and get great use of): - 

•	Wybot C1 pool cleaner, (the most expensive item), 

•	Tenda WIFI 7 mesh 

•	Tobetravel 175W desktop charger (displays the output power). 

•	Kanngou 7 inch Japanese Nakiri Knife is great for kitchen work 

•	Solic mats for the bathroom and dog’s water bowls.

•	STORM HERO Tower Fan

•	Boxer briefs – Step One & Bamboo Cool

•	Bamynoir coffee equipment

•	InHand Gigabit Network Switch

•	Panasonic Hair Dryer

The most disappointing purchases have been: -

•	Kitchen dish drying racks - simply rubbish

•	Clothing – gloves with holes and shirts that don’t match the description (or sizing)

There’s a lot of ‘meh’ items that end up in my Amazon ‘stuff’ box that may be of use one day, or presents on another.

Aside the occasional small group hangouts that were fun, this was my first ever house party that had more than 10 people (around 30 in this case). I had to hide on occasion with my headphones on to cool down. Upstairs was more peaceful than anything. Might've been sleep deprivation or the fact that the double caffeine I drank had long left my body, but I wanted to sleep. Later on the party got to the stage where people started throwing up. Interesting sight and smell. Glad my mum didn't let me drink (and my boyfriend was there to also make sure of that on her behalf hahah). It's also a good thing that I already knew a few people there so I wasn't a total stranger, and my man checked up on me when I was hiding, bless him. Also witnessed couples making out in rooms. There was in fact a lot of people and my brain stopped working. -100hp

On the plus I met a few people from college I never interacted with who were nice to me and we exchanged compliments. Everyone was nice to each other and we all got photos. My face looked chopped but the point is I think the majority of us had fun. Food was also pretty tip tier. I wasn't that up to peopling but it was quite nice seeing people have fun with each other since Year 11 prom. I was exhausted but quite glad I was invited, even danced a bit as well before casually retreating to my corner. +100xp

I slept for 10-11 hours after getting home. My usual is around 5-7 hours with coffee.

Solution: what kind of coffee you like? Does the dog have a funny name for a reason?what’s for the weekend? give people SOMETHING to catch if you really want to start a convo FFS! Not “Hey.”

1oh34zz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh34zz,I think we need to admit there is a difference in POV here,"The writing for OTL is not as complex as some people think. I want to talk about Eunhyuk's behavior towards Sooae here after timeskip. 

We first see him in 106 after timeskip in the panel that traumatised so many people. Because how can the sweet eunhyuk who was soo in love with sooae look at her with such cold eyes? 

When I went to check people's opinion when they first saw it, a lot of them said something like 'he's acting as if she's the one who left him or did him dirty.' 

But what if that's true? 

Eunhyuk's resting face is still somewhat same if you notice his old panels yes but still lack of reaction seemed to give an impression that things ended badly from his Pov too. 

Then we have their office reunion, which pissed off so many more people (understandably so). His initial reaction to her is nervous/surprised at end of 107, so he wasn't expecting her to be on project. Then we had their breakroom scene where he acted polite and a little friendly.

Both sooae and we were mad coz why are u talking to her as if she was just one of your old classmates? But isn't this the way you will act with your ex where things ended messily, and now you were forced to work on project together? 

And if sooae had returned his energy here, we could have even seen eunhyuk talk lightly with her and crack some jokes in future (as he later does in 108). But sooae shut him off completely and from his reaction, you could see that he wasn't expecting that and stepped back. Because one thing eunhyuk does is respect her boundaries. 

And in Korea, it's uncommon to address each other informally like he did to her & he probably thought he made her uncomfortable bcz it's been 10 years. He was just her high schools boyfriend for a short while. 

Later on, he keeps that professional demeanour, and then comes the car scene. Bringing coffee for someone u are gonna work with for long period in a day is common courtesy, nothing wrong, and then it spills and you see him act before thinking by cleaning her up. 

He acts exactly like an ex who loved you a lot and still harbors some old feelings but keeps space coz from his pov you ended things. But his body betrays his mind, just like sooae's does too when she takes care of him while sick or when she protects him from rumors. 

Anyways it's here when sooae acts a little informal by groaning at spilled coffee that he cannot help but joke about being professional. 

It was a teasing remark which again triggered many people but it may feel normal if again from his pov, she left him. 

Their conversation in 109 about eternity is also cordial. Everything is fine but then the shift happens when sooae snaps at him. And it's from here on that his attitude changes & his behavior starts to depict guilt. 

Even in 115, he is shocked to hear that she waited for him outside in snow & punishes himself. He acts cautious around her in 117 but also says things like u haven't changed & enquires about her bond with dohwa. It seems a little resentful as if he hates that everyone and everything in her life remained same except for him. 

Even in 118, he does his best to avoid any interaction wiith her & even while holding her in storage room, he addresses her formally & tries to remain detached so as to not offend her. He only wishes her after she gives him an opening by touching his chest. 

I think rn the biggest mystery isn't him leaving but rather why does he refuse to answer. Now, he knows, sooae hates him for how things ended or that his actions hurt her but why does he refuse to give an explanation?? logically, it may seem that it's hard to open up that conversation without addressing all associated trauma with it but I guess we will find out soon. 

Because his behavior seems pretty linear if he thinks that sooae didn't want that relationship. But if so, then who interrupted their communication is a question! Because it doesn't seem like it was raim now. 

I mean what if he actually left her a new number to contact him but she never got it? Idk too many theories but yeah wanted to post this coz some people think he was deliberately being malicious towards sooae when it is not the case! ",9,1761532399.0,operationtruelove,9,0.91,False

I’m a recent college grad currently working 4 days a week at a cafe, and 3 at a large promotions company (which is what I studied in undergrad and had several internships in the field). 

The promotions company job is only part time but hours are flexible and I certainly could be working more (up to a limit) if my schedule cleared up more. It gets me enough money to pay rent, bills, and groceries as well as save a bit and have a little spending cash but I wouldn’t be making that much money. (It’s worth mentioning I don’t have student loans thankfully).

The cafe is extremely high volume and exhausting. I currently dont have a weekend and am working from 7 in the morning to 3 or often later in the afternoon, and my commute is quite lengthy so by the time I get home I’m a gross and sweaty mess and so tired I can’t bring myself to do anything besides shower and cook dinner and by then I have to go to sleep to get up the next morning. The only real perks are that I get lots of free food and coffee and I like my coworkers a lot. Allegedly theyre going to start scheduling me 3 days a week instead of 4 but management is flakey about schedule changes and even then that leaves me with only one day off.

Needless to say I feel like I’m burning the candle at both ends here. Not only do I not have time for myself to be a person, but I don’t have the time or energy to network with people either outside of or in the promo company to get a better idea of where I want to take my career. Even if I got an interview for a full time job I wouldn’t even have space in my schedule for it unless I called out sick. I also really want to try my hand at freelance photography work as I spent a lot of my undergrad doing that for concerts, dance and fashion shows, etc, but in my current state I truly cant bring myself to even try. 

I’m scared to make the leap as I really enjoy having more financial security but I’m only a few months out of college and already completely burnt out.

built a nextcloud box out of a recycled dell optiplex. 2tb drive, debian, fail2ban, vpn back to my phone. cost me a weekend and maybe forty bucks. it hums in the corner now like a little altar to not trusting corporations with my brain.

first week felt good. like i’d unplugged something that had been siphoning me dry without my noticing. synced my phone, moved my files, set up encrypted backups to an external drive in a fireproof box under my desk.

then the withdrawal hit.

not technical. psychological. i’d be at a coffee shop and reach for a file and remember it was at home. my server was at home. i wasn’t. for fifteen years i could access anything, anywhere, instantly. now i had to plan. think about what i’d need before leaving. felt like carrying a physical notebook again, but worse, because i knew the infrastructure still existed and i’d locked myself out on purpose.

second break was sharing. sent a friend a doc link out of habit. except now it’s a nextcloud url that needs an account or a download. he asked me to just email it. i did. felt like losing.

third was photos. used to auto-upload to google photos where the ai would tag faces, let me search “sunset” or “dog” and pull up six years of shots. now they pile up in folders and i have to remember filenames. looking into photoprism but it’s not the same. i’m the curator now. more work.

biggest break was realizing how much i’d outsourced my own memory. google remembered for me. now i’m relearning how to keep a mental index. it’s slower. frustrating. but it’s mine.

not going back though. added redundancy since then. second backup at a friend’s place, rsync jobs nightly, encrypted offsite copies. system’s stronger now. but the withdrawal’s real. your brain gets wired to the cloud the same way it does to nicotine or doomscrolling. you don’t notice till you stop.

if you’re thinking about it: start small. one service at a time. documents, then photos, then email if you’re brave. don’t rip it all out at once or you’ll break your workflows and crawl back in a week. build the setup first. migrate slow. accept that some things will be less convenient. that’s the cost.

for me it was worth it. my data lives in a box i can touch now. if it dies it’s because i fucked up, not because some tos changed or an algorithm flagged my account.

So I’m building something called BookVerse — a chill little platform for people who love writing but don’t always get the audience they deserve.

If you write stories, poems, or even short novels in your free time and wish there was a place where:

You could publish them chapter by chapter

Add your own cover and genres

Build your own little reader base

And even get a few “Buy Me a Coffee” tips from people who liked your work ☕


Then that’s exactly what BookVerse is about.

It’s not about fancy publishing or big contracts — it’s about getting your words out there, letting others read them, and maybe earning a little appreciation along the way.

I’m still building the first version, but I’d love to know:
