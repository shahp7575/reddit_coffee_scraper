This review is for informational purposes, and the account credit deal that u/mrehousecom mentioned in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MRE/comments/1jc20uv/its_back_the_biggest_mre_bogo_sale_new_rations/).

**Background**

I ordered these on February 15th, 2025 as part of a sale, and both rations arrived in the same Belpost box on March 17th. They got ransacked by US customs at JFK International Airport, and I could tell even before inspecting the box, since the whole package was unusually light, and over a month is a suspiciously long time in transit. That’s no fault of MREhouse in particular, but it is something to be mindful of when ordering MREs from overseas. 

**Russian IRP Menu 4**

Based on my previous experience with Russian MREs, the items missing were all 3 main dishes, the can of pig fat with pork, and the can of liver paté. It's unfortunate that meat products get hit the hardest, because I am very much a ""meat person,"" and trying foreign meat dishes is one of the highlights of my ration trials. The surviving items were: 

* 1 can of sterilized cheese
* 1 can of fruit berry jelly
* 1 can of zucchini caviar
* 1 fruit bar
* 1 50 g packet of condensed milk with chocolate nut paste
* 1 45 g packet of apple jam 
* 4 packets of wheat crackers
* 3 individually wrapped pieces of mint chewing gum
* 2 bags of black tea
* 1 bag of instant coffee
* 1 stick of wild berry-flavored energy drink base
* 4 20 g packets of white sugar
* 1 10 g packet of white sugar
* 1 5 g packet of salt
* 1 1 g packet of pepper
* 3 disinfectant towelettes
* 3 napkins
* 3 spoons
* 1 foldable aluminum stove
* 1 packet of stormproof matches
* 3 hexamine fuel tablets
* 3 water disinfectant tablets

Perhaps unwisely, I ate all three pieces of gum first. From my understanding, the purpose of gum in a military ration is to serve as a pseudo-toothbrush, cleaning the mouth of food particles and refreshing the palette after a meal. But I was impatient. These aren't like the round, mento-looking pieces of gum in the Voentorg rations I've had before—they're lighter, easier to chew, and pretty similar to American mint gums you might find in stores. 

Then I moved onto the fruit bar, which was pretty unremarkable in itself. It just tasted like slightly less-refined and bulkier fruit leather, not a bad sensation but also nothing to write home about. Pretty easy to stuff into your mouth on the go, I suppose.

The crackers were like your typical Russian ration crackers: pretty dense, dry, and flavorless. I cleared out the zucchini caviar and sterilized cheese on just two packets. 

The zucchini caviar was surprisingly flavorful and fun, given that I'm not a huge fan of cucurbits. It added some much needed moisture and savoriness to the crackers, but also worked well on its own. 

The sterilized cheese was quite dense and filling, though on the battlefield, I could imagine those being qualities you want. However, when spread onto the crackers, the cheese did their already thirst-provoking nature no favors.

I had two crackers to spare, so I ended up drinking them with a packet of black tea and one of the 20 g packets of sugar. Disclaimer that I have no idea how much water I was supposed to use for the tea, so I went with 12-13 oz (341-370 ml; I didn't bother to read the bags for actual instruction) of boiling water, let the tea steep, and then added the full stick of sugar and stirred with a metal spoon (the plastic spoons in the ration are pretty useless for hot drinks). While the tea was cooling down, I dipped the crackers in to soften them up and add a little sweetness, which made them a lot more palatable. 

The actual tea was more delicate and flavorful than the black teas I've had here in the US (I'm most familiar with Twinings). There was almost no bitterness or grit, and there was a subtle but pleasant smoky aftertaste. The sugar complemented the drink, but I hardly thought it to be necessary. 

I washed out the cup, and then I poured in the energy drink base and filled the cup back up with about 12-13 oz of chilled water and stirred. Compared to the energy drink bases in US rations, this drink mix was pretty stubborn, and I had to stir vigorously for about 1-2 minutes for the particles to become invisible. The fragrance of the berries was much more pungent compared to US rations as well, and the flavor cuts deeper. There was some bitter aftertaste, but to me, that added to the organic feeling and is probably what made me like it more than the US fruit beverage bases, which tend to neuter the bitterness and sting of real fruit. 

The Russian rations I've had include a coffee that is finer than the Bill's Brew I typically find in US rations, and it's also less bitter and tends to dissolve more evenly in hot water. This ration didn't have a creamer, so instead, I made the coffee with about 10 oz (284 ml) of boiling water, and then mixed in the condensed milk with chocolate nut paste. The end result was exquisite—a creamy, chocolatey drink with light hints of coffee. The only thing I'd do differently next time is use less water, maybe 8 oz (227 ml) to make the whole concoction thicker.. 

This might be controversial, but I actually don't like the apple jam/apple butter/whatever you want to call it. I always eat it out of obligation with the crackers, since I want the full ration experience and I don't want anything to go to waste, but I find it too viscous, too grainy, too sweet, and too artificial-tasting. It's probably my least favorite part of the rations. 

The fruit berry jelly was surprisingly good. I ate it with a pack of crackers, and if I could compare its flavor to anything, it would be that of a fruit roll-up. There is a clear processed taste and texture to the jelly, but it's not off-putting, nor excessively sweet. It added some moisture to the crackers, which was welcome. 

**MVD OPRP Menu 1** 

I couldn't tell exactly what was supposed to have been in this box, as I've never had MVD rations before and the packing slip inside the box didn't list menu items, but I'm assuming the liver paté and main dish were the only things taken out. The surviving items were: 

* 1 can of zucchini caviar
* 1 20 g packet of apple jam 
* 2 packets of wheat crackers
* 1 bag of black tea
* 1 20 g packet of white sugar
* 1 2 g packet of salt
* 1 0.3 g packet of pepper
* 2 disinfectant towelettes
* 1 napkins
* 1 spoons
* 1 foldable aluminum stove
* 1 plastic knife
* 3 hexamine fuel tablets

Most of the items in this ration have direct counterparts in the IRP Menu 4, so I won't get repetitive here. One noticeable difference, though, was that the black tea was more mild, and the smoky flavor less prominent.

This will be the last version I post (adding my first 300), and before I start the querying process, I just want to say thank you to everybody who has given me feedback. My gratitude cannot be expressed through a keyboard. 

  
Dear \[Agent’s Name\],

I am seeking representation for my new adult contemporary romance novel THE ROOMMATE REFLEX. I see you’re looking for \[BLANK\]. This 80,000 word STEM slow-burn will appeal to fans of Helen Hoang’s *The Kiss Quotient* and Hannah Grace’s *Daydream*.

Aspiring cardiologist Amelie “Ellie” Liu has spent two years at St. Helena College acing all pre-med courses—except the one that actually involves the heart. After her mother’s sudden cardiac death, she’s arrhythmically skipped taking anatomy until this semester.

With a mediocre MCAT score and her father’s ultimatum—get into St. Helena Medical School or move back to Shanghai, Ellie must ace anatomy and secure a letter of recommendation from the notoriously difficult professor. On top of that, Ellie’s best friend drops out before the start of junior year, leaving her in a house with an empty bedroom and two girls who blame her, forced to find a replacement.

Enter Stefan Song, the magnetic ex-soccer star who mysteriously quit the team. After losing his scholarship and housing, he’s desperate for somewhere to stay before moving back home to finish college. 

Stefan is charming, secretly brilliant, and the one person who helps her see the heart as more than a failing organ. As study sessions transform into morning coffees, messy parties, and midnight heart-to-hearts, Stefan’s reckless reputation unravels, and Ellie slowly starts to understand the heart—in more ways than one. But the more she learns, the more she realizes that love, like anatomy, isn’t an easy concept to grasp. With Stefan’s time at St. Helena running out and her father threatening to uproot her life, Ellie must decide if she’ll keep running from her heart’s failures, or finally trust it to beat for something more.

\[BIO\]

Thank you for your time and consideration.

  
**First 300**

I’m not saying I’d hold someone hostage to fill up the empty room before rent is due. I’m not *not* saying that either, though. 

Last week when I was attempting to make pasta in peace, Amber declared that I’d be the one responsible for paying rent if we didn’t have a replacement soon. And when I asked why, Shelly stuck her head out of the door of their shared double room to add that the “very obvious” reason why is because *I’m* the reason Penny left.

The sentiment wasn’t completely true—at least I hoped it wasn’t.

And then they returned to their shared bedroom, and I heard, “I think it’s because of Penny’s fight with Ellie,” about four times.

Stef Song is about to be my Lord and Savior, because rent is due in two days, and I most definitely wasn’t going to pay rent for that empty room. 

I’m making a last ditch effort to wipe down the kitchen counters when the doorbell chimes. I jolt. Shelly and Amber’s shared room is sealed shut like a brand new bottle of prescription medication, no indication it’ll open any time soon.

The doorbell rings again. I take my hair out of the loop on my head and pat down my tee shirt and denim shorts, hoping I embody the definition of a standout roommate. As much as I like what little I know of Stef Song, I need her to like me too. I can’t live next door to someone who hates me, especially when I already live across the hall from two people who currently act like they do.

When I open the door, the excitement drains out of my circulatory system. It’s not Stef Song but a guy dressed in a Nike running shirt and gray sweats.

ten years are enough for things to stabilize.

ten whole years are what it takes for alpha to become a whole different demon.

meorie, smart and scheming as he is, knew the huge opportunity he had the moment he saw alpha sitting next to that corpse, and he would act on it as soon as possible, sure, he just needed the inccubus to get over it first.

it wasn't actually too much of a hassle, honestly. he didn't bother them both too much, just stayed in his room for most of the day, joined them silently for a few meals when the hunger was too much to handle, and handled his breakdowns on his own. bloody wanted to help him, and so did meorie, but he shut them both out. they knew it wasn't from a place of anger, lack of trust or anything, he just... knew they couldn't actually do anything.

slowly, he started coming out more, and slowly, meorie put his plan in action.

he was never one to get his hands dirty, and he was not one to ask the hellhound to do it, either. first because she was too much of a softie to do it, even though she could definitely kill with her bare hands, secondly because even if she could mentally do it, she simply couldn't be arsed to. he was also not one to hire goons or anything, because he just found it hard to give these tasks to demons he had no trust in, and who had no personal stakes in his plans. alpha, though, was just right, especially now that he had crossed that line, killed one of his own kin.

and alpha offered surprisingly little resistance to his suggestions.

in no time, the innocent, naive, sinless young boy that had just manifested and couldn't quite fit in, was now ruthless, hardened, his talons filthy with sinner's guts and whatever else meorie commanded him to plunge his fists in, desperate to quell a rage that still bubbled, trying to suppress another emotion he did not dare to acknowledge.



he spat on the trembling hellhound's face, and that was enough of a message for them to turn on all fours and leave, scurrying along the trash on the alleyway. that, and the thorough beating they took. the strong legs his inccubus form gave him turned out to be quite a blessing.

alpha wiped a little blood off his cheek, the sting of a punch in his left eye was sure to make itself noticeable for the next few weeks, but that didn't bother him much. as he walked home, hearing only the sounds of his talons on the ground and the swishing of his tail, he looked up at the night sky, a million undesirable thoughts flooding his mind.

thirteen years.

thirteen years, and that goddamn seraphim hadn't left his mind.

the angels had descended more times and unleashed more chaos, yes, but he hadn't returned. not yet.

alpha didn't know if that relieved him

or made him *upset*.

thankfully for his sanity, all of that was thrown to the very very back of his mind when he got home and his friends were eagerly waiting for him on the couch, with a weird looking book on the coffee table, and a childlike grin on their faces. he couldn't help a little smile himself, even though he knew that much excitement from them could only end bad.

""...what's that?""

As stated, my daught is 5 and I have been noticing things that seem odd.
Im sorry that this is so long, im just at such a loss. We've been to our GP several times over the years and we've never been offered any testing. I am aware that you are unable to diagnose, but I am worried and I feel like I need to advocate for my daughter and that starts with, hopefully, knowing what I need to ask for. So I am giving as much information as I can.
Thank you again for your time.

Pregnancy/ Birth Facts:
- 4th pregnancy, 3rd birth
- GD insulin dependant 
- ulcerative colitis, was on Inflectra until 32 weeks
- attempt vbac induction @ 38 weeks
- emergency c-section due to poor contractions, fetal distress
- took first breath 4 minutes after birth
- issues regulating blood sugars and body temp, 5 days in NICU

At 8 weeks old she had a bad fever for 24 hours and would not go down with meds. Spent 7 days in the hospital on antibiotics and fluids and a multitude of tests, including a spinal tap. Bad reading and she had a false positive for meningitis. Never had an answer to what caused her illness.

Completely healthy, happy baby until solids were started. We had to delay because she would constantly vomit and she would become incredibly constipated. Doc said it was reflux and she was fine.

At 2 years old, she became so incredibly constipated that more than once, I had to help ""scrape"" poop out of her because it was so hard. Doctor said its normal, give her restorlax. This continued, doc said to just keep giving her restorlax. All is well. 

Went to the hospital at 4 years old due to fever and constipation. ER doc said she was fine and said to keep giving restorlax is that's what the GP said to do. 

She is now 5.5 years old and we have had a very difficult time potty training. Between the constant constipation and her telling me that sometimes she doesn't know when she needs to pee, its been a struggle.

Odd ""symptom"" facts:
- she pees A LOT
- her urine is incredibly fowl smelling, not like typical ammonia smelling, but very pungent
- still constipated 
- sometimes shes incredibly sleepy and will sleep 12+ hours (not difficult to wake, just grumpy)
- she gets every illness any of us get, but worse. 
- she has fevers constantly, and will fever before and or with any minor illness including what appears tp be the common cold 
- quite often, she will miss meals lately 
- shes thrown up several times randomly. I say randomly because she was not ill and after throwing up she was fine. Twice in the morning (different instance and months apart), this last time was about a month ago and she had not eaten at all that day. When she vomited, it was brown and had the coffee ground appearance. I called Health Link because I was worried about the appearance, they said it was fine and just an irritated tummy from lack of food. 
- she woke up with pink eye this morning and it has quickly turned into the worst case I have seen in any of my children, and we've dealt with it several times. Her eye is so swollen that even if the discharge wasn't gluing her eye shut, the swelling would be doing enough, and of course, she has a fever.

She is 38F and married for 4 years.

She recently admitted to me that she had began liking someone else and as soon as she began liking him,i was the first person to know about it.
I will put up whole story and will try to narrate the whole incident and i hope readers can put it together.

Okay so this happened when we went to our family friends wedding.
There she saw a guy who was like 23-24 years old and was looking at her and trying to her attention and she noticed it.
She also began liking his stares at her.
She even told me about it that some guy is constantly looking at her and she was liking it.
To my surprise she wanted to sit at a place where they could see each other better and even went around for a walk in the venue so she can see him.
She was acting like i was her friend who she could tell everything.
She was visible excited and joyed that this guy was trying to catch her attention and she said he was good looking and thats the reason she was liking his attention.
So this was a pre wedding function and 2 days later was wedding.

She was totally full of excitment to see him again and was lost in the moment and shared with how amazing it was feeling


So the day comes and all she did the wedding day was try to catch his attention by giving looks and at one point she went and sat at a different table because she felt that guy was hesitant in looking at her or even approaching her as she was with her whole family and she walked around venue also so he can approach her. She did not focus on wedding and i felt she did not have her mind on her family too and was all about him that day.
The guy was around her but didnt come to her obviously due to scare i think.
But she was visibly upset leaving the venue as she didnt get his contact and said she wouldnt mind getting in touch with him on social site or would meet him also for coffee date.
She said she had a crush on him and kind of liked him.

She shared with me everything and said she was so guilty of feeling like this and also didnt want to do this behind my back so didnt hide it.

Few days later she opentallked to me that she isnt kind of person who would like 2 guys at one time and she was low on liking part with me during those days and this incident happened.

She said after these years of marriage she wasnt very excited as constantly trying to put everything at place in married life and managing a house had put her under pressure.

She liked me more was everything was care free and all we thought about was having fun and going around.

But obviously after marriage things change a bit and you have to take up more responsibility and along with being a couple you also become 2 people who have to manage a house and a social life and there is some pressure.

She missed being care free and freedom which she saw in that guy and was wanting to feel like it.

She said it was an interesting run with him because he was complete stranger and a mystery to her and she like this idea.
Getting to know someone from begining.

She recently also had began asking for a vodka every once in a while.
She hadnt drank after marriage though but now wants to.

She believes things are great but the excitment part isnt there anymore in marriage.
She feels great but gets bored at times.

We got Cinnamon from an adoption center and the only thing I know about him is that he was a stray before. He's very lovable but plays way too roughly. He's definitely softer on us than the toys but there are times when he plays with CC and I see him pull some fur off. I know he's not trying to fight because there's no yelling,hissing,or growling. CC will hiss and growl at him to tell him to back off, and sometimes he does, sometimes he backs off for a little bit and will try to play again shortly after. CC initiates play with him sometimes too so I feel like they would get along great if he knew how to hold back. I'm guessing he didn't have enough time near littermates to learn how to hold back or something. He's rough with us sometimes and when he is we yell and take our arm/hand/whatever he's biting away, but I'm not sure if he's really learning. what can I do to help him learn to hold back some?

1jdxuce,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jdxuce/im_so_burnt_out_huge_whine/,I’m so burnt out (huge whine),"I hate being a downer but I’m so tired. I’m so tired of explaining to people how sick I am. They will never get it. I would not have understood so I don’t blame them. Part of me even feels like it’s unreal to be this miserable for so long. I’m literally physically and mentally tired, but also psychologically just getting run down from fighting this invisible sickness every day. (Basically housebound, hard to be upright, constant dpdr, crazy neuro like problems).

I can’t even explain the vast horrible depth of it to people either. I can sort of briefly touch on what is going on, but to really give anyone even a concept of what is truly happening would take a half hour at least and exhaust me. And no one ever asks. They want the brief version which they then put their own spin on every time they talk to you. I think it’s worse because I was always the fit healthy one who never had health issues before this, so they don’t see me as I am now.

I only truly try to explain everything I’ve gone through when I have to speak to a new doctor. And EVEN THEN I can’t remember or describe everything that I have been through in the last 19 months. The sensations, the cognitive failures, the jolts, the zaps, the numbness, the vision issues, the breathing issues, swallowing issues, on and on, and each symptoms has its own set of insane symptoms. 
I can’t even start to explain in a “brief” easy way for instance that it’s not just “light sensitivity,” it’s a million other things and there is some crazy shit like not being able to look at complicated shapes or faces. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much. I had to sleep with my arm elevated for months in a specific position to be able to not get chest surges, felt like I couldn’t walk straight, etc. but I can’t tell people this stuff because it would take all day. How do I explain that I’m pretty sure I have things like muscle atrophy on just one side, but the progression has been so slow I can’t tell what’s actually happening. 

The two necessary relationships in my life are both a source of aggravation at this point, but I’m now trapped financially and indebted to these people. The rest of my relationships are becoming too tiresome for me to try to hold on to even though I know I should. And it’s depressing to watch people go about their lives when mine has been reduced to waking up, grudgingly eating a lot of small meals, drinking coffee when I can, and petting my cat while I wait for the day to be over so I can go to sleep and see what the future brings. Don’t get me wrong, I like my cat and coffee and audiobooks, but it’s a very small life and even smaller when your cognitive awareness doesn’t work right. I’ve lost everything else pretty much and I feel like my body is dissolving literally. Every day feels like another let down.
I feel like I’m dying of aids or something while people just pat me on the hand and tell me there’s nothing to be concerned about.

I’m trying so hard to maintain a baseline, I even still workout. But GOT DAMNB I am tired. (Throw a really bad menstrual cycle in there this month too just for fun because life isn’t hard enough). 

I’m tired of freezing no matter what temp it is.
I’m tired of wearing the same stupid clothes.
I’m tired of not being able to eat more things. 
Tired of instantly forgetting everything.
Tired of looking at the same stuff everyday. 
Tired of my hands not working properly.
Etc etc etc ……

I sort of just want to give up and lay here until I wither away. Until my physical form becomes literally someone else’s problem.  I’m tired of trying. Anyway, I’m not trying to be depressing, I’m definitely going to keep dragging my ass from one day to the next, if for no better reason than spite. But for fucks sake

, this month has been a lot so I just had to get it off my chest. 

Now it’s time to get in bed and play my phone game since my eyes don’t hurt right now. At least my thumbs still work.

1jdxsk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jdxsk7/my_husband_secretly_texted_his_ex_while_i_was/,My husband secretly texted his Ex while I was having our baby,"So I recently found messages that my husband intentionally hid from me. 

For context: I say “ex” but they never dated. Him and this girl had sex together before him and I met. Shortly after we started dating him and I talked about everyone we ever slept with so I’ve always known about her. We have been together for 6 years now, married for 3 years and recently just had our first child. 

A few days ago I was sending myself photos I took from his phone when I saw this girls name in his messages. I clicked on them to read through and it turns out he has been texting her in secret for months or maybe longer? I have briefly told him in the past that I was uncomfortable with them staying in touch because I don’t see a reason for them to. I was under the impression that this was just a casual fling and that she is not a significant person in his life so I see no reason for them to continue to communicate.  I never gave it another thought. However, these messages felt very condescending towards me when they talked about how they both think it’s silly that I won’t let them stay in touch. He even asked to meet her at a coffee shop without me knowing and asked multiple times if she was available for a phone call. He also told her to start messaging him on Instagram because it’s more private and I’m less likely to find their messages there. 

When I found these I immediately confronted him and he played dumb at first and then he said that they were close friends for years before he met me and that he didn’t like being told that he couldn’t talk to her. He swore nothing happened between them since we have been together and that they never actually met up or talked on the phone. I just don’t know if I believe him? And now I know that he has no problem lying to me and hiding things so it has me questioning if I can trust him at all?

Another massive issue is that during the time span of these messages I was 9 months pregnant and then I had a c section and the recovery was brutal. I struggled to be able to walk for days and then I got a horrible allergic reaction to the bandage on my scar. I then got back to back mastitis 4 times and had a fever of 104°F. THEN I got COVID. It was absolutely horrible and I don’t feel like he was there for me at all. He didn’t help me with nights  and he always complained about being tired the next day. When I had a fever he took a nap while I took care of our newborn son and told me to just wake him up if I felt like I needed to go to the doctor.  I still have a lot of resentment because of the lack of help I got during my postpartum and now I find out he somehow found the time in all of that to be talking to this girl? 

I have no clue if this is something I should work through or if it’s a warning sign that this marriage is doomed?? ",14,1742275224.0,Marriage,7,1.0,False

I haven't been diagnosed but I've had all, and I mean *all* the symptoms in my adulthood and all the trademark symptoms, (trachycardia, loss of vision standing up while swaying, freezing cold feet and hands, not able to handle any temperature extremities/poor temperature control, blood pooling, etc)

And ever since I gave birth really random symptoms have been worsened like blood pooling a *lot* fast than before, random nausea, random Vertigo, way more chronic fatigue than before... but my trachycardia isn't as present??

Like yay but also I kinda needed that to be officially diagnosed???? I know there's other dysautonomias but nothing and I mean *nothing* fits the exact description I've experienced more than POTS.

My trachycardia used to be so bad that I could see my shirt moving as well as my chest from the palpitations. I've thought 'I'm going into cardiac arrest??' before. I've been taking my pulse and doing the 'poor man's table tilt' test and my bpm does go to 30+, but not most of the time. Maybe like more than a quarter of the time??

I'm on Zoloft and Vyvanse (I just raised my doses too) and I think that may have something to do w it?? Like my symptoms are all around more manageable in one way but in another when Vyvanse wears off it worsens. 

Like I've just been sitting there drinking coffee (this was before I even know what POTS was sometime this past month) and it happened at *random*??? Face felt melted, head under water, vision gone, nearly fainted, fast heart rate that wouldn't slow down for NOTHINGGG until I laid down and then the usual tinnitus bout and loud noise coming back.

I looked under my bed just last night and came back up and couldn't breathe


But they aren't as consistent as others POTS? I'm so confused. It still happens and only in things regarding postural and classic things like caffeine trigger it harder but it's not as consistent as I'm understanding

I work days and he works nights so it's tough to find a mutual time. I am finally meeting him tomorrow at a coffee shop. He also keeps making sexually suggestive remarks. Maybe I have been out of it for too long...but how do you feel that for someone over texts? And the chats we have had, very basic. Not deep convos. To me, he is still a stranger.

I think part of it is that I am not getting good vibes from him. Maybe it's reading too many novels but how about being considerate? Something in my gut doesn't scream yes for him. I think it's because we haven't seen each other in person.

My boss seems to be very concerned about who's paying for things in my relationship with my boyfriend, who he knows nothing about. I really don't understand because there was a point where he was saying he was proud of me because I have my own place, car, and care for a child on my own. My coworkers say he talks really good behind my back too. Now that I'm in a relationship, he's saying my boyfriend should be paying for more things.

It started with him asking who's paying for food every time I got takeout. Then one day I was talking about an expense I have coming up, and he says ""why not ask your boyfriend for money? He should be paying some of your bills."" Because it's still a new relationship, we don't live together yet, and I'm not a gold digger. What a good way to push a man away. I don't expect him to pay my bills while we're not living together. 

Then last time I worked, he said some rude things about my man. The conversation went like this

""I have a big car payment coming up. I'd be willing to pick up more shifts"" 

""Why doesn't your boyfriend help you? He should be helping you with your car and helping paying for it. Doesn't sound like he does enough for you. What does he do, bring you iced coffee while you're at work? He should get 3 jobs. When I lived in Brooklyn NY, I worked 3 jobs. I wouldn't let my girlfriend pay for anything.""

""He did try to help with my car, he looked at it for hours with my stepdad. They just didn't have the tools they needed, and there was a deeper problem. He also paid for a tow after it broke down. My man helps me cook and clean, he spends as much time with me as possible, and has offered to pay for more things. I've been independent for years and have a hard time accepting help, especially money. He's offered to pay for more things, but I tell him he doesn't have to. My man treats me absolutely amazing.""

I don't understand why he's so concerned about my relationship he knows nothing about. Meanwhile he's in his 30's and is dating a girl who is barely legal, they were most likely talking before she even turned 18. Why would he tell everyone he's proud of me for being independent, but then that my brand new boyfriend should step in and take care of me? I can't tell if he actually cares and was raised differently, or if he's jealous. I could see it being either. He is the kind of person who really values money, and will take his bad mood out on people. Everyone at work knows that about him",6,1742274562.0,coworkerstories,8,0.8,False

We connect our mics into the P.A. system and use the two speakers for vocals with two microphones. We were wondering what would be the best placement for the speakers, I am having trouble finding information online about the specific placement of using only two p.a. system speakers for vocals and two guitarists and their guitar amps.

Currently our amps are about 9 feet away from each other near the back of the room wall, the two vocal speakers are about 3 feet in front of us and centered between the nine feet distance. It feels like it drowns out where I can't hear my brother's guitar as good because our vocals are half drowning the sound out. Basically like this with character text:

EDIT: The speakers are powered speakers. We just got them to use for vocal amps and also to use for our DJ machines and mixers. They are the same speakers I think that are in this photo  [https://hpro-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/insights/uploads/2018/03/JBL\_PRX800\_LifestylePhoto\_SoundCheck-e1520347790327.jpg](https://hpro-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/insights/uploads/2018/03/JBL_PRX800_LifestylePhoto_SoundCheck-e1520347790327.jpg) placed infront of the band facing towards them placed horizontally. Does this mean these speakers are only supposed to be used as monitors facing the band for the band to hear and we can't use them for vocals? Previously we would only jam with guitar amps all lined up against the wall. The current speaker placement is mostly only because there is a coffee table in the center that the powered speakers sit on and I DJ practice on them with a spare bookshelf board placed across sometimes.

# Breville Toaster Phone (2025): Is It Worth Teh Hype? Review & Alternatives

The tech world is always buzzing with speculation, rumors, and outright outlandish concepts. Lately,one such concept has been gaining traction – the *Breville Toaster Phone*. Yes, you read that right.The company known for its high-end kitchen appliances, especially its innovative toasters and smart ovens, is rumored to be entering the smartphone market. But is there any truth to this rumor, and more importantly, would a *breville toaster phone* even be something worth considering?

This article dives deep into the *breville toaster phone* phenomenon, separating fact from fiction, exploring the potential appeal (and drawbacks) of such a device, and outlining potential alternatives for those seeking specific features or a *reliable smartphone*. We'll cover everything from the possibility of a *breville smartphone* existing to what people might actually be looking for when they search for such an unusual combination of functions.

[[Explore Top Rated breville toaster phone on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/vitamix/?kw=breville toaster phone)
## The Smoke and Mirrors: Is a Breville Phone Even Real?

Let's address the elephant in the room: as of today, there is absolutely no concrete evidence that Breville is developing a smartphone, let alone a *breville toaster phone*.The idea seems to have originated from a combination of wishful thinking, internet humor, and perhaps a misunderstanding of breville's commitment to innovation and *breville technology*.

While Breville is known for pushing boundaries in the kitchen appliance world, their expertise lies in areas like heating elements, precise temperature control, and user-friendly interfaces, as seen in their smart toasters and ovens. Translating these skills to the complex world of smartphones – processors, operating systems, cellular connectivity – is a important leap, and there's no indication they've made that leap.

However, the fact that the idea of a *breville toaster phone* has captured the public's imagination speaks to a genuine interest in simple, reliable, and well-designed technology.The very concept exposes what some users feel are shortcomings in today's mobile device market, with consumers possibly searching for a *reliable smartphone* that does the basics well, without unnecessary bloat or planned obsolescence.

## Why the Hype? Deconstructing the Appeal of a Toaster Phone

Despite the lack of evidence, the idea of a *breville toaster phone* sparks interest.Why? Several factors likely contribute to this:

*   **breville's Brand Reputation:** Breville has cultivated an image of quality, reliability, and thoughtful design. For many, a *breville smart phone* immediately conjures images of a dependable, well-built device – the antithesis of flimsy, disposable gadgets. The loyalty to the brand is strong,with consumers actively searching for *breville product reviews* and heading to the *breville official website* for product data and updates.

*   **A Desire for Simplicity:** In a market saturated with increasingly complex smartphones boasting features many users rarely utilize, the concept of a ""toaster phone"" – a device that performs essential functions reliably – is appealing. People may specifically be searching for the *best basic phone*, highlighting the desire for functional, no-frills technology. This contrasts with the perceived trend of unnecessary complication in modern devices.

*   **Novelty and Humor:** Let's face it, the idea of a combined toaster and phone is inherently funny.People searching for *funny phone concepts* are likely drawn to the absurdity of the idea, imagining a device that literally toasts while you talk. This novelty appeal can generate buzz and even lead to the creation of humorous mockups and designs.

*   **Reliability and Durability:** The comparison to a toaster implies exceptional reliability and robustness. If we think of the *breville toaster phone* metaphorically, it's about building a *unbreakable phone* that handles daily tasks without constant glitches or the need for frequent repairs. This is a serious concern for many users frustrated with the fragility and planned obsolescence of modern smartphones.

## The ""Toasty"" Features: What Could a Breville Phone Offer?

Let's indulge in some hypothetical speculation. If Breville *were* to enter the smartphone market, what unique features could they bring to the table?

*   **Unmatched Reliability:** The core promise of a *breville toaster phone* would be its unwavering reliability. Breville's expertise in heating elements and temperature control could possibly translate into highly efficient power management, resulting in longer battery life and reduced overheating issues.

*   **Exceptional Build Quality:** Breville products are known for their robust construction and durable materials. A *breville smart phone* would likely be built to withstand the rigors of daily use, potentially featuring enhanced water resistance and impact protection.

*   **Intuitive User Interface:** Breville emphasizes user-friendliness in its appliance designs. A *breville smartphone* could feature a simplified, intuitive user interface, catering to users who find modern smartphone operating systems overly complex. This focus on simplicity aligns with the searches for a *best basic phone*.*   **Seamless Integration with Breville Ecosystem:** Imagine a phone that seamlessly integrates with other *breville connected devices* in your kitchen. You could start preheating your Breville Smart Oven from your phone, or receive notifications when your coffee is ready. This level of integration would appeal to existing Breville customers invested in their ecosystem.

## The Cold Hard Truth: Potential Downsides

While the idea of a *breville toaster phone* is intriguing, it's critically important to acknowledge the potential challenges and drawbacks:

*   **Lack of Smartphone Expertise:** Breville's expertise lies in kitchen appliances, not mobile technology.entering the smartphone market would require significant investment in research and development, as well as the acquisition of talent with expertise in hardware engineering, software development, and cellular technology.

*   **Competition in a Saturated Market:** the smartphone market is fiercely competitive, dominated by established players like Apple and Samsung. Breaking into this market and gaining market share would be an uphill battle.

*   **Potential for Feature Creep:** One of the appeals of a ""toaster phone"" is its simplicity. However,there's a risk that Breville would feel pressured to add features to compete with other smartphones,potentially diluting the core strength of the device.

*   **Price Point:** Breville products typically command a premium price. A *breville appliance price* search will reveal that their products are positioned in the higher end market. This suggests a *breville smartphone* would likely also be expensive,potentially limiting its appeal to a niche audience.

Tl;dr, travelling on VB from Jaipur to Delhi, and a girl asks me to exchange seat. For detailed read, here's what happened!

I was still half-asleep when, crawling through the onboarded passengers, I found my seat—48, aisle. I was amongst the last to board. As I took a quick glance at the overhead rack to check for space for my trolley, my eyes lit up at the sight of the still-vacant window seat.

Settling my luggage and myself in, the train reached the Gandhinagar station, whixh was just a few minutes from the junction. Many passengers use to board frm here, due to the convenience of the smaller station (less walking, cabs practically kissing the platform, and mostly functional escalators).  

Knowing in my heart that tjis has to be it, I anxiously waited for the owner of the prized window seat beside my 48-Isle. As it played 'doors are closing', passengers continued crwaling through the lobby as I kept reading their eyes, assessing their movements. Just then, from behind, a girl slowed down beside me. Her deceleration was inversely proportional to my heart rate, which was racing.  

Still wishing her seat could be some other around, I turned toward her. She stopped and looked down at me. I knew this was it. Still, I gestured toward the window seat, silently asking if it was hers. As my heart screamed Nooo, she said Yes.

With the heaviest of hearts, I stood up to place her trolley bag in the overhead rack while she juggled with the rest of her luggage - a backpack and a few loose bags. My eyes drifted to the window, where the first rays of the sun was painting the still-sleepy green trees into gold. As I stood waiting for her to settle in, she continued rearranging her bags, trying different permutations.  

I cursed myself, regretting the few window clicks I could hav taken before she arrived, when she looked up at me and asked, ""Umm… would you mind shifting to my seat, please? I have some luggage, and if I could sit on the aisle...""  

Before she could finish her sentence, I nodded in disbelief. And before she could shift her focus from her ever-falling loose bags to the magical scenery outside, I had already jumped into the prized seat, crossing the 48-isle.

I've never been the kind of person to judge someone based purely on actions alone. I always questioned beneath reasonings and had curiousity to why someone may hide or test their environment. I myself have been a person with multiple reddits and used them to try to get proper responses being people can generalize you based on experience over actually understanding you and your choices and who you are as a whole. You'd be surprised how many people hide behind names to gain more perspective. It's understandable and something I wouldn't be upset to find out. I'm someone who nearly ever gets upset due to the complexity of peoples feelings and reasoning. I believe everyone deserves a voice may it be something the standard is frowned upon. I believe everyone deserves a chance to acknowledge their own actions being it's theirs they are providing not for me to feel offended by. The truth sets people free though I know how difficult it must be to trust having built a life of protection when it should have been a life with boundaries, that's okay, trust can be built. 

I hope people can learn to be comfortable with me enough to know I'm simply human and make my own mistakes and at times generalizations. Correct me if I do, you are welcome to add to my room of debates and understandings. I'm very open to learning different perspectives. 

Today the morning was great as I spoke with a new person that is kind and welcoming. Bless your heart. My car broke down and it got repaired but still needs to be supervised. Guess a rat was living in the hood of my car and chewed up a few cords. Luckily it was not a serious issue to fix.

I went on a walk and began to feel Doctor's presence in my soul, feel his touch, his lips, his fingers caressing my shoulders then down my spine. I tingled in pleasure and my body was flushed. The thought of him had my heart racing. I then fell to the side of the sidewalk and started laughing at myself for being so distracted in sexual heat. Then I remembered he wasn't here, he wasn't gonna ring up my phone and we weren't going to be spiritually one. I started craving some hard whiskey and some irresponsible risk taking like going to dangerous areas alone without location being on. My area can be rural and has been known for men attempting to kidnap women. 

I knew where to go to seek such danger and I was right. I was being followed by a man who went a completely different direction and came back minutes later watching me and then scooping the area for other people. Luckily there were other drivers around and he looked very nervous and frustrated so he left still glaring at me as I looked at him, his eyes looked crazed and wide. I was being reckless. I then walked further away arguing with myself to stop being stupid. I decided to go on a trail where there were hills and people. Saw lots of cute desert animals lizards, crows, squirrels, gophers standing on rocks and running into dirt holes. 

The mountains looked amazing from the hill paths like seeing a picture come to life. 

An adorable fluffy dog wanted to play so bad and I blew a kiss at it, it was so curious about me sweetest cutest doggy. :) I have a dog named Dean he was the runt and Idk why but I loved him even more being so fierce and independent for a little cutie. He's just as curious as my children they all play together and it can be so much fun as he's so lovable. 

As time passed I had to get my oldest from school there is a trail leading to the school. I began to feel dizzy and disoriented as I held on to a nearby fence for balance, I realized I had forgotten to eat. As I continued to walk that's when I broke down crying, it came all of a sudden as the flowers and the birds chirping reminded me he was gone. I wanted to fall to my knees, instead I bent down balancing on my knees as tears fell down my face. Everything stood still for a moment, I kept telling myself it's okay, it's okay. Once I gathered myself I thought I was becoming delirious as I spotted a well fed napping cat under the tree on this nature trail. It made me burst out in laughter at the oddity of finding a cat just relaxing with no bother. He didn't seem to care that I was there his eyes shut and just enjoying his peaceful rest. I bowed to Mr.Cat and told him my farewells as I felt I should not bother his slumber. 

After finally picking up my daughter and heading home my husband asked if I'd like to watch a movie. Tediously looking for coffee on my phone to get delivered I joined him on the couch. 

Moonfall! It was amazing I don't watch movies often anymore and I just loved it. The ideas of science, calculations, theories probably over exaggerated but I was hooked!!! The ending I DEMANDED to know more!!!!! 

Now here I am pondering my life and what the future has in store for me. 

Idk but I hope the UNIVERSE grants me a shooting star so maybe just maybe I will remain a hopeless romantic. ;) muuuahhh Love you all who lurk and wish you an amazing blessed journey in your lives. ❤️🥀👋🏻

I have been on the fence about him. I've tried not to let it show to her though, as I really didn't know him beyond what she had told me.

This past week, she asked if I wanted to spend a day with her. Everything we've done lately has been largely what she's wanted, she wanted a day mainly for me. After we would meet him in town for a coffee/dessert so I could actually get to know him. We were supposed to thrift until 5pm, slowly working our way towards the city to meet him by his work when he was off. Outside of rush hour, it is a 45 minute drive, in rush hour it is an hour and a half. Rush hour is worst at 3pm in that area. At 3pm he texts her he's off early and going to head to the meet up spot early and hopes to see us soon. For context, from where we were to her house is a 20 minute drive, and my house is between her place and the meet up spot. It is easy to get to from her place, but construction hell to get to coming from the meet up point, especially rush hour. Before we left I verified he still wanted to meet up, as if he wasn't up to it I would just drive him to her

I cut out the rest of my plans I wanted to do, and instead spent the next hour and a half trying to fight my way thru rush hour while she just messaged him and tried to keep him entertained while he was bored in his car waiting. We get to the meet up spot and she calls him, he says he is at Starbucks, she mentioned she would rather do a cheaper small shop for budget, and he said he wanted Starbucks. He showed up with his coffee, told me he had a bad day and was burnt out, and that if I still wanted to do things, he would be waiting in the car until I was ready finish, but he and his girlfriend were tired so I should try to make it quick. He had known all day it would be like this, and it was his friends fault for putting him in that mood. He just really wasn't in the mindset to drive with his mood, and needed to calm down which is why going by her place wouldn't work. He also wasn't impressed he had to wait so long. I told them to just go home. He took her on a date after when he realized he had more energy.

She really wants us to meet again and be friends. She thinks it was just a bad day and will be better next time. I feel used. He changed the plans on me, promised he actually wanted to get to know me and it was worth me making the drive, and then acting like me being there was an inconvenience for him. I am not driving into town for him again. If he wants to meet me, I'll drop her off at her place and wait there with her for him to arrive. I am not willing to go out of my way to accommodate him when he used me as a free taxi to get his girlfriend to him and doesn't even have the decency to apologize. I'm even debating if I can keep the friendship if this is how she let's her boyfriend treat me. He is 33, he should be past using people the first time he meets them. She thinks he is entitled to his feelings and I should respect him and stop overreacting.",1,1742272718.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Ever feel like your to-do list is endless, but your energy is *not*? 🥱 Let me take you on a little journey of how I managed to hack my day and suddenly found myself with 10 extra hours a week—just by tweaking how I schedule my time. Spoiler: It's not about cramming in more stuff.

**Time Blocking vs. Energy Peaks: Which is the secret sauce?**

A while back, I embarked on a quest to reclaim my day. I'm as guilty as anyone of packing my schedule tighter than a suitcase before vacation. But then it hit me: Why am I not getting things done even with everything meticulously time-blocked? 🤯

**Here's what I discovered:**

- **Not all hours are created equal.** Just because a clock says it's time to work doesn't mean your brain agrees. Ever tried to write an email at 3 PM and it felt like wrestling a bear? Yeah, same.

- **Energy peaks are *gold*.** We all have that sweet spot during the day when we're unstoppable—whether it's early morning, mid-day, or the infamous night owl zone. Realizing *when* you're naturally pumped can change the game.

- **Match tasks with energy.** During my most energetic time, I tackle high-focus tasks that demand creativity or decision-making. When I'm in a post-lunch slump, I switch to simpler tasks, like sorting emails or planning the next Netflix binge (just kidding… or not?).

So, what's this miracle schedule that saved me? Here’s a peek:

1. **Morning Routine:** Coffee ☕ and a power hour of my most mentally demanding work.
2. **Mid-Morning:** When I’m still riding that caffeine wave, I dive into projects or brainstorming sessions.
3. **Post-Lunch Coma:** Switch to automatic tasks like organizing or admin work.
4. **Afternoon Bounce-back:** Second wind? Time for complex problem-solving or content creation.
5. **Evening Wind Down:** Reflect on the day and *plan tomorrow* based on how today went.

And here’s where the magic happened: By respecting my energy rather than just the clock, I stopped spinning my wheels. It’s not about cramming more in; it’s about using energy efficiently.

**Relatable or what?** 😅 Finding this rhythm didn't just make me more productive. It reduced stress and, honestly, made work feel a little less like work.

Would love to hear about your peak times or any hacks you've discovered that keep you on top of your game. I might need to steal a few ideas! 😉",1,1742272662.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

i’m not talking about coming in in sandals, i’m talking about all of the sudden NO one is allowed to have any mesh of any kind and my manager has said a vague “we’ve been seeing more injuries related to shoes” did something happen that I’m not aware of? Did someone get seriously hurt/burned. 

My manager specifically said the vertica is a big issue since as we all know the coffee comes out literal molten hot. 

But suddenly out of nowhere all week we’re all being asked to change our mesh shoes or mesh adjacent. Even if they’re not mesh they have to HAVE to be leather, fake leather, suede, or rubber. 

Why now? I have a pair of shoes for crews work shoes i got less than a year ago they were EASILY $80 and now i just have to toss them away and get more??? I get the safety aspect of it, but i’m confused where this is coming from. I’ve been here 6 years this year and never had an issue with shoes of all things. 

I’m not anti dresscode AT ALL even, it’s there for good reason but i’m SO extremely lost.

1jdx3lc,https://i.redd.it/3ts8g8tkmdpe1.png,"Update to ""RIP Tuxedo Kitty""","While digging the hole to bury the cat I decided that every cat deserves a name. So I picked Patty because of what day it was, a nice neutral name. Then I said that I should write a little memorial to tape to the box (pictured above.)

The quote is paraphrasing lyrics from a song called ""The Adventures of Pickle"" by a little known band called Coffee Project. The song was written as an apology to Pickle the Cat after he got out and went missing before eventually returning. Except the real line is ""flew far away."" I had just gotten back from a long weekend or I may have found it sooner.

The bottom line....well after realizing I needed something to write on the back that I needed to fix up the box itself. I cleaned the cat up a bit first. Then found an old pillow case that I used to line the box and another that I wrapped her in. Oh, when cleaning her I discovered it was most likely a girl cat. Then I used a hand towel as a makeshift pillow for her.

Once she was all nice in the box I apologized for not being able to save her and I said, ""You don't need to run away anymore. You can just rest."" I immediately burst in tears and have been absolutely heartbroken all day. 

This is a little silly but I've had these wet cat food samples that were randomly mailed to the house just sitting on the counter. I put them in the box with her too. Then I taped the paper to the box and tried to tape it shut the best I could before burying it in a corner of my backyard. I put a couple of flowers in the ground as a makeshift memorial.

The Wave of Death – Gaza.,"""Do you wake up to the sound of bombs instead of birds? Do you count the dead instead of counting your blessings? In Gaza, life is not a right—it’s a temporary miracle. While you sip your coffee in peace, a child is searching for their mother beneath the rubble. A mother is cradling the lifeless body of her child. A people are being erased while the world watches in silence. Don’t say you can’t do anything. Boycott. Speak up. Share the truth. Silence is complicity. Neutrality is betrayal. Be the voice for those buried beneath the ruins.

You are human, just like us. Would you be okay with your country being wiped off the map? Would you still call it 'just news' if it were you?

To the mothers: Imagine—God forbid—your child in the ICU for five days. The pain, the fear, the endless waiting. Now think of those poisoned by the toxic gases from bombs, suffering for days. And if they somehow find an ambulance, it won’t matter—because a settler's car will block the road, refusing to let them pass, even at the cost of their own life.

To the fathers: Wouldn’t it break you to come home with no money, no food for your family? In Gaza, when a father returns after two days of hunger, he finds one of his children dying—not just from starvation, but under the ruins of a home with no roof, no walls.

Go on, world. Enjoy your happiness while you still can. But if this were happening in your country, your joy would vanish, and others would live in blissful ignorance—because the media would hide it from them, just like they hide Gaza from you.

Gaza is being erased. Every street, every family, every soul. Will you stand on the right side of history and fight for its survival, or will you surrender to Israel—America’s darling?""**
