1gpfwfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTurkey/comments/1gpfwfd/why_are_istanbul_airport_employees_so_rude/,Why are istanbul airport employees so rude?,"
I’ve been through turkish airports for layovers a few times and I never had issues, Atatürk airport was a great experience and I never had any issue with that airport however they are gone now. 

But I had a 9 hour layover in  at the new airport and keep in mind this is my first time at this new airport and when I first went inside I was stunned by the architecture and the way everything was setup but my smile immediately dropped by the time I entered passport control. The staff and border control were extremely rude regardless if you are turkish or not and majority of them weren’t even at their booths to push the extremely huge line of people through passport control. Instead, they were all huddled up together either on their phones or talking with each other with coffee in their hands and acting like they’re in some sort of turkish drama.. 

And when I come out of the gate and terminal I enter a whole new place and absolutely have no idea where to go, and when I ask a worker there the closest piece of civilization at the airport and she gives me a eyeroll and sigh and shows me where to go with her hands and I have absolutely no clue what shes doing and by the time shes done she quickly hurries off before I utter anything 

After that hell was done, I went to grab a quick turkish coffee from a small cafe around the part where all the designer stores are and when I gave my money to the worker he brings back COMPLETELY wrong change, I gave him a $50 USD bill and he comes back with $15 dollars. At first I scrubbed it off as I knew I am in a foreign country however they did the SAME thing with my father and they did the SAME thing on the way back home!!!!!! how could this not be a sort of scam they are running????

I lowkey miss the old airport and its embarassing for the staff to be this bad because this sort of attitude will always give people who come by through this airport a bad expression of turkey even though turkey is one of the most beautiful countries in the world with some of the most hospitable people.

He gave her my number. Her text later that afternoon was somewhere along lines of, “Hey, your husband gave me your number so you could tell me local things to do in the area with kids. Thanks.”

I read it and was like…am I google? She didn’t introduce herself, it was a very cold non friendly text. I also explained to him that I don’t have the bandwidth to connect with complete strangers, I have a Mom friend group that has taken me well over a year to establish and I’m not just bringing some complete stranger into the fold. I would never respond and just say, “Hey! Come to this play date etc.” because…well…she’s a stranger. 

I think my husband meant well but I tried to explain the mental load and not to give my number out to random women, I’m way too much of an introvert for that. 

Anyway, he runs into her all the time and it’s definitely awkward I never texted her back and then today I met her for first time today randomly with him and she was with her husband and kids / said hi and bye, she is fine, not really my vibe but anyway…

TLDR: How would you guys react if your husband gave random Mom your number and then you got a blind text message from someone you have never met asking you to tell her what activities to bring her kids to?",2,1731397654.0,workingmoms,8,0.75,False

After battling with my many yrs of abuse and one my longest abusers, adult male . I needed too free myself from the loads of secrets, that were stressing me out .
I choose too break the silence as 13yr boy . And all of a sudden I was the black sheep of the family.  And everyone stopped inviting me to family functions.  Because heaven forbid I might be telling the truth.  Which was ok because it happened from a family member on mother's side of the family. And I lived with my father by then . 

So getting back too me speaking out . I was in therapy at the time for my anger issues. I finally decided to let someone in on why, and I told alot of truth that day .
Next thing I knew I was doing a police interview,  telling them how long it went on for how times I was penetrated,  where this happened.  They wanted to know where the parents were and why I didn't speak out sooner. 
It was alot for a  13 yr to deal with . I know that I know  it needed too happen as in speaking out . 

But I went from that special little boy loved by so many too that kid something happened too . In a blink of an eye . 

It had too happen,  later on in life he actually apologize to me in public around people.My grandmother heard it.

1gpfhr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gpfhr0/an_empty_home_and_broken_dreams/,An Empty Home and Broken Dreams,"I am sitting on my couch in a gutted home. One filled with lost dreams and broken promises. A few weeks ago I was lying soundly in bed next to the woman carrying our child. A child who she considered a gift upon us as parents, blessing us. We were going to get married and start a family. Now I am alone waiting out the clock as we bought out our lease, while the child got aborted and she is with another man. I lost my child, my partner, my home, my family. All in a short october.

How do I feel nothing but sorrow while I stay sitting on a couch WE bought together, in the home WE built. I lost a part of myself now. I lost a part of my soul that will go forever. I know I can find another amazing soul to be with in the future. Hearing my friend go over the possibilities and wanting to be a groomsman at the wedding in the future helped me realize it's possible. Someone that truly loves me and doesn't just use me as a shoulder to lie on. One that I will open myself up and not use as a way to heal.

But that time is not now.

Now I feel like my life has been stripped away and lost, never to return in this way again. Gone. Today I am picking up pieces of myself and trying to get it together. Running errands, shopping, trying to get ready for the holidays the best I can.

I came home tonight after journaling at an Ihop while drinking some coffee, just to be away. I wished to myself her car was there, that i'd walk to the front door and open it, expecting her to be there. She'd probably be asleep at this hour, I couldn't wake her up if I tried, stomping around the house. I remember getting in bed and cuddling her, putting my hand on her stomach knowing we had something there. But we couldnt have that child knowing what happened now. I remember what it was like when things were okay. But I have to find a new place now, by myself. I have never lived alone before and I am scared in a way. But it must be better than being here while we wait for the move out date. I will never spend another night under the same roof as her again. I understand what happened between us means we can never go back again, but sometimes I wish I can expirence one more day when things were okay.

But they weren't okay, I know she was holding back feelings that I only fully learned the extent of later. In a lot of ways I was not a good man to her, I hold on to so much and used her as a way to heal. It wasn't right to her, she didn't deserve that. She told me a few days ago as she was moving her stuff out that, no matter how she explains it, she is going to be the villain. What was I supposed to say to that?

Declare that you don't love me and haven't loved me the night you get back from dinner with this dude. Want to get rid of our child after weeks and weeks of wishing. We were scared, yes it's normal to doubt. But there always was that peace at the end of the day knowing our baby was there. If you really didnt like me then why get us this far. I don't want to call you the villain. But she wasn't happy. 

I wish we could put out our christmas pillow on the couch. We never got the opportunity to do so. I gave it to her because it reminded me of a future and I couldn't bear to look at it.

I love my friends and they are there for me but they won't understand this feeling no matter how much I talks. I come home and it doesn't feel like a home. It's so empty now, physically and emotionally. We have more things to split, things we bought together. Who gets this and that? We used each other in a way. I hate talking to people without them being able to hear her perspective.

I miss her warmth next to me at night, the way she flops around the bed like a fish. She'd sometimes murmur in bed when she's dreaming. Occasionally she'd whimper and wake up in a panic, i'd shoot up to hug her until she went back to sleep. Always such a dreamer.

I believe I am holding onto the past and not who she is now. The cold stare and utilitarian words that exit her mouth. It's business now, moving forward.

I just have to keep moving forward, one step at a time. I write in my journal and type in my writing document over and over. I write because I am unsure. I set myself 2 goals for the day to crawl forward. The path forward must be followed or I will fall apart irreversibly. I write because I am scared.

I dread and adore the day where we will have our last conversation. I know it's coming soon. Going no contact will help the healing process and finally get myself looking forward, focusing on what I need.

I am terrified but I have had a month to process thus far and I think I am doing a good job.",1,1731397016.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1gpfe8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wodehouse/comments/1gpfe8n/scene_from_an_alternate_version_of_uncle_fred_in/,Scene from an Alternate Version of Uncle Fred in the Springtime,"((Back in May, I managed to track down a second version of Uncle Fred in the Springtime that I'd read about in one of the Jaggard/Ring guides. After Wodehouse turned in the original manuscript, the Saturday Evening Post asked him to shorten it significantly for its printing in their magazine, and he did so by cutting a few scenes and removing Horace Davenport and Valerie Twistleton entirely. It [was available on the Internet Archive back in May](https://archive.org/details/sim_saturday-evening-post_1939-04-22_211_43), and I wish I'd linked it here then, but a couple of months later, the Archive lost the right to lend out those issues of the Post at all, so all that's left is my screencap of the parts I liked. Madame Eulalie should be able to put it up in about ten years when it enters the public domain, but I thought this one scene should be fine to share, just to show how Wodehouse recontextualized some of his existing text to accommodate the new plot.

To my surprise, I found that the overall plot actually makes more sense in the abridged version, but some of the cuts are tragic, including the whole climactic Persian Monarchs story plus some other funny bits with Mustard Pott. In this version, Baxter is the one who took Polly Pott (renamed to Polly Halliday) to the dance in the guise of a Zulu warrior, and got arrested there after being attacked by Ricky Gilpin. He did this because he'd discovered her relationship with Ricky, the Duke of Dunstable's nephew. He took dancing lessons from her for a few weeks, and was planning to use the fancy dress ball to ascertain just how far her relationship with Ricky had gone, so that he could finally place the facts before the Duke and have this unwise match destroyed. (...I know how that sounds, but it's confirmed to really be his only motive for dancing with a pretty girl for several weeks. 🤷)

As in the original book, Sir Roderick has met ""the Duke of Dunstable"" on the train (actually Baxter), and given him a clean bill of mental health, leaving Uncle Fred free to impersonate Sir Roderick at Blandings. However, in the abridged version, Sir Roderick decides to send a telegram to Blandings that very night, explaining his absence and promising to write a full letter later on. Baxter, meanwhile, has been stymied by a slightly different confrontation with Uncle Fred and Pongo: Uncle Fred knows  he was at the fancy dress ball not through Horace's report, but because Polly told them her date's name and how he got arrested. And earlier, Lord Emsworth had complained to Uncle Fred that Lady Constance was having the wine watered down, at Baxter's recommendation. So the Duke is still looking for an excuse to fire Baxter for the first time, which Uncle Fred threatens to make happen.))


ABRIDGED SATURDAY EVENING POST VERSION:

[Sir Roderick's telegram] found Lady Constance in a mood of serene contentment. In the drawing room over the coffee, she had had an extended interview with the visiting brain specialist, and his views regarding the Duke, she was pleased to find, were identical with her own. He endorsed her opinion that steps must be taken immediately, but assured her that only the simplest form of treatment was required to render His Grace a man who, if you put an egg into his hand, would not know what to do with it.

And she had been running over in her mind a few of his most soothing pronouncements and thinking what a delightful person he was, when Beach, the butler, entered her boudoir with an orange envelope on a salver, and opening it, she read as follows:

LADY CONSTANCE KEEBLE, BLANDINGS CASTLE, SHROPSHIRE.

PLEASE FORGIVE MY
NONARRIVAL.

CIRCUMSTANCES ARISEN WHICH RENDER VISIT UN-NECESSARY. DELIGHTED ASSURE YOU POSITIVELY NO CAUSE ANXIETY.

WRITING FULLY.

RODERICK GLOSSOP.

It was a communication which, considering that she had only just seen Sir Roderick Glossop go off with the Duke to the latter's suite, might well have mystified her, and for perhaps an instant it did. Then her mind leaped to the truth. Her agreeable guest was no Glossop, but merely a pseudo or synthetic Glossop--in other words, a deceiver and an impostor.

That she should rapidly have accepted the telegram's implications was due partly to her native intelligence, but principally to the fact that this sort of thing had happened to her before.

Where another woman, accordingly, might have wasted time in fruitless wonderings, Lady Constance acted.

Beach had scarcely left the room before she recalled him and bade him find Mr. Baxter and inform him that she would be glad if he would come to her immediately. And presently the secretary appeared, looking careworn.

""Mr. BAX-ter!"" cried Lady Con-stance. ""Read this!""

The next few moments were moments of acute disappointment to her.

If there was one man in the world who might have been counted on with confidence to behave like a bloodhound on the trail the instant he was shown that telegram, she had supposed it would have been Rupert Baxter. Hitherto, his attitude toward Blandings Castle's impostors had always been impeccable, and it was for this reason that she had automatically selected him as her confidant. But now he failed completely to rise to the situation.

Having inspected the telegram, he stood fumbling it, then, blinking behind his spectacles, said in a sheepish, spiritless voice:

""Some mistake.""

""Mistake?""

From anyone eise she would have received this extraordinary statement with raised eyebrows and a shriveling stare. But her faith in this man was the faith of a little child. The strength of his personality, though she had a strong personality herself, had always dominated her. And now for a brief instant she actually did feel that there must have been a mistake.

Then the absurdity of the idea eame home to her. ""How can it be a mistake? Isn't it obvious that this man who claims to be Sir Roderick Glossop is a fraud? You can't have read the telegram properly. Look at it. Signed by Sir Roderick himself.""

""Er--yes.""

""It says he isn't coming.""

""He may have changed his mind.""

""And come after all, you mean?""

""Er--yes.""

""Then he is one of the most remarkable men I have ever encountered. While dressing for dinner at Blandings Castle, he is able to send off telegrams in London.
Perhaps you did not observe that this one was handed in in Piccadilly just before eight o'clock.""

Baxter shuffled uncomfortably. ""I--er--I should imagine that the explanation of that is that Sir Roderick-earlier in the day thought that he would be unable to come--and told his secretary to telegraph to you--and—er— forgot to countermand it.""

""Whereupon the secretary waits till eight o'clock and then sends off the message. Mr. Baxter,"" said Lady Constance, ""really.""

Baxter moistened his lips. All this was agony to him. No one could have been more keenly alive to the fact that he was cutting an ignoble figure.

""It is all very mysterious,"" he mumbled, ""but I do not see that there is anything to be done about it.""

Lady Constance stared at him, amazed. No sportsman, introducing his terrier to rats and seeing the animal back uneasily away, could have been more disconcerted.

Knowing nothing of what had passed between this backslider and Lord Ickenham in the latter's bedroom, she found his attitude inexplicable.

""Nothing to be done about it?"" she cried. ""I shall naturally have the man thrown out immediately.""

Baxter's spectacles flickered with a panic light. ""Please, Lady Constance!"" he exclaimed. ""I beg of you to do nothing of the sort.""

""Mr. Baxter. I simply do not understand you. Why?""

""It would ruin my career.""

It is never pleasant for a proud man to have to confess that scoundrels have got him in cleft sticks, and in Rupert Baxter's manner as he told his tale there was nothing of relish. But painful though it was, he told it clearly.

""You will see, then,"" he concluded, ""that if you make anything in the nature of an overt move, I shall lose my post. And my post is all important to me. It is my intention ultimately to become the Duke's man of affairs, in charge of all his interests. I hope I can rely on you, Lady Constance, to do nothing that will interfere with that?""

""Of course,"" said Lady Constance.

Her cold displeasure had melted. She understood all and pardoned all. Not for an instant, now that the facts had been placed before her, did she contemplate the idea of hindering his rise to the heights. ""You think, then, that if this man is exposed, he will retaliate by telling Alaric that it was at your suggestion that the wine was watered?""

""He told me so himself, without any possibility of a misunderstanding.""

""Then we are helpless!""

""I fear so.""

With a wide gesture of despair, Rupert Baxter withdrew, and Lady Constance rose from her chair and started to pace the room in agitation.

The thought of being compelled to continue entertaining this impostor until such time as he should decide to loot the house and leave with the sack over his shoulder was not an agreeable one. [....]

ORIGINAL PUBLISHED VERSION:

In supposing that their heart-to-heart talk would cause Rupert Baxter to abandon his intention of making a public exposure of his machinations, Lord Ickenham had been correct. In his assumption that he had rendered the man behind the steel-rimmed spectacles a spent force, however, he had erred. Baxter's hat was still in the ring. At Blandings Castle he had a staunch ally in whom he could always confide, and it was to her boudoir that he made his way within five minutes of leaving the billiard-room.

""Could I speak to you for a moment, Lady Constance?""

""Certainly, Mr. Baxter.""

""Thank you,"" said the secretary, and took a seat.

He had found Lady Constance in a mood of serene contentment. In the drawing-room over the coffee she had had an extended interview with that eminent brain-specialist, Sir Roderick Glossop, and his views regarding the Duke, she was pleased to find, were in complete accord with her own. He endorsed her opinion that steps must be taken immediately, but assured her that only the simplest form of treatment was required to render His Grace a man who, if you put an egg into his hand, would not know what to do with it.

And she had been running over in her mind a few of his most soothing pronouncements and thinking what a delightful man he was, when in came Baxter. And within a minute, for he was never a man to beat about the bush and break things gently, he had wrecked her peace of mind as thoroughly as if it had been a sitting-room and he her old friend with a whippy-shafted poke in his hand.

From anyone else she would have received the extraordinary statement which he had just made with raised eyebrows and a shrivelling stare. But her faith in this man was the faith of a little child. The strength of his personality, though she had a strong personality herself, had always dominated her completely.

""Mr. BAX-ter!""

The secretary had anticipated some such reaction on her part. This spasm of emotion was what is known in the motion-picture world as 'the quick take 'um,' and in the circumstances he supposed that it was inevitable. He waited in stern silence for it to expend itself.

""Are you sure?""

A flash of steel-rimmed spectacles told her that Rupert Baxter was not a man who made statements without being sure.

""He admitted it to me personally.""

""But he is such a charming man.""

""Naturally. Charm is the chief stock-in-trade of persons of that type.""

Lady Constance's mind was beginning to adjust itself to the position of affairs. After all, she reflected, this was not the first time that impostors had insinuated themselves into Blandings Castle. Her nephew Ronald's chorus-girl, to name one instance, had arrived in the guise of an American heiress. And there had been other cases. Indeed, she might have felt justified in moments of depression in yielding to the gloomy view that her visiting list consisted almost exclusively of impostors. There appeared to be something about Blandings Castle that attracted impostors as cat-nip attracts cats.

""You say he admitted it?""

""He had no alternative.""

""Then I suppose he has left the house?""

Something of embarrassment crept into Rupert Baxter's manner. His spectacles seemed to flicker.

""Well, no,"" he said.

""No?"" cried Lady Constance, amazed. Impostors were tougher stuff than she had supposed.

""A difficulty has arisen.""

It is never pleasant for a proud man to have to confess that scoundrels have got him in cleft sticks, and in Rupert Baxter's manner as he told his tale there was nothing of relish. But painful though it was, he told it clearly.

""To make anything in the nature of an overt move is impossible. It would result in my losing my post, and my post is all important to me. It is my intention ultimately to become the Duke's man of affairs, in charge of all his interests. I hope I can rely on you to do nothing that will jeopardize my career.""

""Of course,"" said Lady Constance. Not for an instant did she contemplate the idea of hindering this man's rise to the heights. Nevertheless, she chafed. ""But is there nothing to be done? Are we to allow this person to remain and loot the house at his leisure?""

On this point, Rupert Baxter felt that he was in a position to reassure her.

""He is not here with any motive of robbery. He has come in the hope of trapping Horace Davenport into marriage with that girl.""

""What!""

""He virtually said as much. When I told him that I knew him to be an impostor, he said something flippant about not having come after the spoons but because he was trying to do what he described as
'a bit of good to two loving hearts.' His meaning escaped me at the time, but I have now remembered something which had been hovering on the edge of my mind ever since I saw these people at Paddington. I had had one of those vague ideas one gets that I had seen this girl before somewhere. It has now come back to me. She was at that Ball with Horace Davenport. One sees the whole thing quite clearly. In London, presumably, she was unable to make him commit himself definitely, so she has followed him here in the hope of creating some situation which will compel him to marry her.""

The fiendish cunning of the scheme appalled Lady Constance.

""But what can we do?""

""I myself, as I have explained, can do nothing. But surely a hint from you to the Duke that his nephew is in danger of being lured into a disastrous marriage---""

""But he does not know it is a disastrous marriage.""

""You mean that he is under the impression that the girl is the daughter of Sir Roderick Glossop, the brain specialist?
But even so. The Duke is a man acutely alive to the existence of class distinctions, and I think that as a wife for his nephew he would consider the daughter of a brain specialist hardly--""

""Oh, yes,"" said Lady Constance, brightening. ""I see what you mean. Yes, Alaric is and always has been a perfect snob.""

""Quite,"" said Baxter, glad to find his point taken. ""I feel sure that it will not be difficult for you to influence him. Then I will leave the matter in your hands.""

The initial emotion of Lady Constance, when she found herself alone, was relief, and for a while nothing came to weaken this relief. Rupert Baxter, as always, seemed in his efficient way to have put everything right and pointed out with masterly clearness the solution of the problem. There was, she felt, as she had so often felt, nobody like him.

But gradually, now that his magnetic personality was no longer there to sway her mind, there began to steal over her a growing uneasiness. Specious though the theory was which he had put forward, that the current instalment of impostors at Blandings Castle had no designs on the castle's many valuable contents but were bent simply on the task of getting Horace Davenport into a morning coat and sponge-bag trousers and leading him up the aisle, she found herself less and less able to credit it.

To Lady Constance's mind, impostors were not like that. Practical rather than romantic, as she saw it, they preferred jewellery to wedding bells. They might not actually disdain the 'Voice That breathed O'er Eden,' but in their scale of values it ran a very poor second to diamond necklaces.
 
She rose from her chair in agitation. She felt that something must be done, and done immediately. Even in her alarm, of course, she did not consider the idea of finding Rupert Baxter and trying to argue him out of his opinions. One did not argue with Rupert Baxter. What he said, he said, and you had to accept it. Her desire was to buttonhole some soothingly solid person who would listen to her and either allay her fears or suggest some way of staving off disaster. And it so happened that Blandings Castle housed at that moment perhaps the most solid person who had ever said 'Yoicks' to a fox-hound.

In the hope that he would also prove soothing, she hurried from the room in quest of her nephew, Lord Bosham.",2,1731396566.0,Wodehouse,0,1.0,False
1gpfe5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gpfe5r/am_i_overreacting_by_telling_my_boyfriend_were/,Am I overreacting by telling my boyfriend “we’re done” if he doesn’t end his friendship with his ex?,"My (66) boyfriend (67) and I have been together for almost 4 years but his ex girlfriend has been in his life for about 10-15 years now. He is 30 years her senior. Another man “took her away” from him about 7 years ago. His ex has an off and on relationship with this other man and my boyfriend is also his friend. 
This boyfriend of hers is the father of her 2 year old boy. My boyfriend has become very attached to this little boy and asks his ex if she’ll bring him over to play. He/we also babysit at times. So now her little boy absolutely adores my boyfriend and of course I adore the boy as well. I don’t want to deny my boyfriend of his relationship with her son. 
Here’s the catch. His ex is very friendly with her ex/my boyfriend and she let me know when we first met that my boyfriend would do anything she asked him to do because “he loves me”. 
My ex denies he loves her, she denies that she loves him, yet she gets him to do anything she’s asks for. He gives her money, let her stay with him when he had his own apartment (and my ex even told me she’s asked for sex before) but he claims he’s never had sex with her since we’ve been together. She also swears that she would never have sex with him and has even told me after we got together how much she hated him. She claimed she lost custody of her kids from a previous relationship (they never had kids together) yet they get along very well and never fight. 
Now she stops by almost daily before she goes to work so he can give her a cigarette and coffee while I’m still asleep. He texts her several times a day and is always wondering where she is, where her son is and seems to care about her a lot more than I think he’s admitted.
I’m so tired of her being in my life. When my boyfriend and I moved in together, she even made up his bedroom, put up curtains and put his clothes away in his dresser. She brought furniture for our living room in and basically decorated the entire apartment. There’s so much more I could say but it would be a novel.
I know he loves her little boy but I told my boyfriend I can’t do this anymore. I’ve been more than patient and I’m done. I honestly don’t know what to think. ",1,1731396555.0,AmIOverreacting,4,0.67,False

We chatted for a while and nagkayayaan na magkape since yun ang isa sa common ground namin, we love coffee. We had our first meet up sa SB somewhere in Makati. It was a late night coffee run since he’s a night owl.

He shared his work dilemma and he even shared na he’s in some kind of networking business that sells food supplements (YUNG COLOR BLUE!), dito palang sumegway na sya agad and offered me to join them but eventually declined considering ang laki ng hinihingi na “membership” something and I can’t commit into selling it. Eventually, we agreed to meet again sa same coffee shop and wala pa mang kape na naorder eh nagpasama sya sa kanilang “office” sandali since malapit naman na daw kame sa area. So eto na nga, we went to THE networking business office and introduced me to other people.

I replaced the top screw with a 5/64"" x 1/4"" roll pin. I only did this because I didn't have the right set screw laying around, and I didn't feel like waiting for another one to get shipped to me.

For laal maans I would suggest go to niros it is the best for laal maans.

Gulab ji chai wala - it's a simple place where people sit and chat over nice gud(jaggery) tea had their tea and bun maska both were good.

doing on my computer since the day I started (almost 2 years ago) if I get a teams message or new email he will try and look over and read it.

Luckily I have a passcode but I was so mad because that’s my personal phone, like my personal life, photos, messages everything!! But I couldn’t prove it.

I’ve started arranging my work from home days around his schedule so I don’t have to see him, if he’s on leave or working from home I’ll go into the office, and when he’s in the office I’ll work from home but I think he's caught on because he made a rule that I work from home Monday and Tuesday and he Thursday and Friday. He said he won’t swap the days with me he said he wants those days, so now I can't move around his schedule (he's also never worked from home prior to this and never wanted to) but when I get to the office, he has swapped the days with the other guys so it’s just him and me alone in the office, and I feel sick to my stomach, like the feeling of him staring at me from behind and us alone is so eerie.

He also makes weird/moaning noises but only does it when we’re alone, like he will start coughing continuously all day but make a moaning sound when he coughs and never does it when the other guys are there 

He has done so many other things that cross massive boundaries, the list is so long.
He’s also controlling, like if he can’t control me which he can’t, his power as a manager only goes so far and he knows I know that, so he will try to control how I feel, and if he knows I don’t like something he will do it 100 times more to get under my skin, like he does with the moaning noises.

Over the last few years, I've really fallen in love with making and drinking coffee. I imagine it went for me the way it does for many - I began drinking coffee as a teen for productivity and the grown-up aspect of it, eventually falling down the internet rabbit hole as a young adult. I got my first Aeropress and hand grinder shortly after and it's been all downhill from there. 

Although I've tried espresso a few times, I've never really liked it. I would write it off as just being something that's not for me but I felt the same way about very light roasts until I had the opportunity to experiment and dial in my preferences. Because of that, I feel like espresso might also be something I could enjoy if done properly, but I have no idea where to start. I'm also afraid of shelling out for a machine and realizing I actually don't like it. The issue is I'm in an area without many coffee shops and the ones that exist are basically off-brand Starbucks with worse hiring practices, so I have no idea how to test the waters without getting my own setup or getting lucky and finding a barista that knows what they're doing.  

As a side note, I've been looking at the Flair Neo Flex and really like it (I like manual things I guess). I'd love to hear any thoughts, qualms, or praise you might have for it. It's currently the top candidate for my first machine if I decide to take the plunge. 

On mobile, mostly a lurker, and none of the flairs seemed to fit well, so sorry about any issues with formatting and such. 

TLDR; I like coffee, think I might like espresso, but the few times I've tried it were unpleasant. Would write it off but I used to feel the same way about light roasts until I started brewing them better, so I'm trying to find ways to experiment in an area that doesn't have any reliably good coffee shops without spending a ton of money.",0,1731394695.0,espresso,4,0.5,False

1gpewxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1gpewxe/a_shadow_in_the_boiler_room/,A shadow in the boiler room,"Hey everyone,

I’ve had an experience that’s been lingering in my mind, and I thought this would be the best place to share it and hopefully get some perspective. This is actually the first time I’m sharing this with anyone.

This happened three years ago at my workplace, a large, luxury hotel built in the 1970s. 

There’s a boiler room beneath the hotel, and I’d often go there when I wanted to take a break or just have some time to myself. One day, I was sitting down there, drinking coffee and browsing on my phone, when I noticed something in my peripheral vision on the wall opposite me.

It looked like the silhouette of a person, just a simple outline, a shadow. I didn’t think much of it at first, but as I turned my eyes to focus on it, the shadow darted across the wall, moving in my direction before vanishing almost immediately. The whole thing lasted no more than a second or two, but it was enough to unsettle me. I was alone in there, no chance someone was in the room with me. 

After seeing it, I stopped going down there unless I absolutely have to, and if I can, I try to have someone with me. The energy of the room feels different now, almost malicious.

I’ve tried to rationalize it, maybe it was a trick of the light or my eyes playing tricks. It lasted just long enough that I kept on rethinking it.

 Has anyone experienced anything like this? I’d really appreciate any thoughts or similar experiences.",2,1731394408.0,witchcraft,1,1.0,False

Let’s name her “Aafia.” 

Aafia was raised very, very sheltered so she’s very awkward. She was essentially raised by Bollywood movies, Pakistani dramas, and a very two cold parents. Her parents are two people that shouldn’t be married and are not compatible so her idea of love is from the movies. Her mother favors the two boys because she prefers “sons.” Could be sympathy of her opening up to me but that’s kind of how she became my unofficial little sister.

She’s a very good girl, bubbly, and super cultural/conservative. Her parents didn’t let her get a cell until she was 20 or pursue junior college right after high school. She went straight into odd jobs to support her family financially. From retail to fast food, she was working. 

When I was married and moved away, she took it the hardest. I was her only “cousin” she was comfortable with at family gatherings. She would call me and check on my constantly when my marriage was falling apart. When she was 22, she opened up to me that she was ready to meet someone and get married and if I knew anyone which I didn’t. I was en route to umrah and made dua that whatever was written for her, to be hers. 

I use the word sheltered loosely - I mean eccentric. She believed in many conspiracy theories, doesn’t believe in a lot of modern medicine, does the holistic route, and relies solely on dua as medicine/therapy. 
It was a coincidence but suitors started pouring in. Whether it was from weddings, apps, social media, or family connections.  My cousin is not unattractive but her parents wouldn’t let her “groom” herself until she was married. (Not religion or cultural - a family rule? Idk. Liberal enough not to wear hijab and dress western) 

She has a thick unibrow, a lush mustache that men would envy, and if you know what a goiter is, it’s a very large swelling on the front part of her neck. I would compare it to an orange in size and it’s visible from the front but from the side it’s very very noticeable. 

Her solution? A holistic doctor on YouTube told her to go vegan and wear a pure silver anklet on whatever leg which is connected to something to the thyroid - idk. She’s not using any medication and there isn’t any doctor intervention. 

At a recent wedding, a mutual aunt who’s a longtime nurse cornered her and lectured her about taking her health seriously as an untreated goiter can lead to serious complications. She was tearing into Aafia for being so young and not handling it.

Aafias solution? Finally does her brows and upper lip. Then she meets her first suitor at a wedding while wearing a high-neck dress. He meets the next day for coffee and flat out asks what’s wrong with her neck. She mentions the thyroid problem and how she’s treating it. The guy was so shocked by it he walks out mid conversation. The rejection shocked her so much, she didn’t leave her room for a week. 

Aafia signs up for the Muslim app and the guys speak to her before they see her pictures. They match and friendzone her immediately. She’s so delulu she thinks it’d because they’re insecure from her beauty and tried to convince everyone around her. 

Instagram? They would video call her then block her immediately. She happened to match with a doctor who was also giving her advice on her neck before she blocked him. 

She’s aware it’s there but thinks it’s not noticeable. Besides the way it looks - the health complications really scare me.

Now there’s a guy who’s interested in meeting her. Aafias mom works at a popular store in town that many Afghans and Pakistanis frequent. One of her regular customers happen to be Afghan and mentioned her 26 year old son who’s trying to settle down. Aafias mom showed her daughter’s photo to the woman who sent it to her son.

Her son liked the photo and asked to meet her. Aafias mom wanted to meet him first before he met her. Aafia called me excitedly about this guy. He’s a handsome guy, local teacher, educated, and from a good family. She wants to meet him with a chaperone at a local coffee shop and is already planning her future wedding.

The mother meets him and likes the guy. He starts getting aafia and they make plans to meet up for coffee. Her dad’s brother will be a table over while they meet but before they go, she video calls me.

Aafia is wearing a choker that’s about to rip around her neck, a low collar shirt that really emphasizes the goiter, and very heavy mismatched makeup. She’s telling me how she’s been making dua and has a very good feeling about this guy. 

I asked her if she had time to change and she said she was already late and heading over. I made dua he would look past everything and get to know her. They ended up not meeting as he got into a fender bender and rescheduled to meet. 

I don’t know how to tell her that the neck bump is very noticeable and people interpret it with illness as she thinks nobody can tell. She refuses to believe that’s why people sometimes turn her down. Besides that and the weird hair, clothes, and makeup choices she makes, she’s so sensitive and such a hopeless romantic, I don’t know how to approach her about.

I have a bad feeling another rejection is coming and this may push her over the edge into a deep depression as she almost there.

How do I approach any of this?!",3,1731394219.0,MuslimNikah,4,1.0,False

1gper66,https://i.redd.it/zplagari2f0e1.png,90 second shot (not a troll post),"Hoping this gets some discussion among those who have tried similar. (Friends who love dark roast may wanna skip this one )

·Ethiopia Elto Arbegona, ""light-medium"" roast
·Very fine grind, some will call this a choked shot. #9 on zeroed Niche Zero.
·Mischief 20g high extraction basket
·18g in, 45g out. 
·100°C temp (saturated group head, open fill, yes steaming n a bit messy)

·70 second preinfusion (Hard ramp to 4 bar, 15 seconds to first drops, drop to 0.1 bar for 55 seconds). Followed by brewing.
·Hard ramp to 10 bar to 35g. Decline to 8 bar until 45g. End

Result: 
·Appearance is more watery than usual, with less crema. 
·Flavour intensity much higher than with IMS basket.
·increased flavour clarity (peach, mango, light floral), high sweetness, very obvious lack of bitterness
·body is thick and syrupy despite longer pull and lack of crema.


Key points:
1. ""lighter"" roast with very dense beans. I have no doubt this profile won't work with dark roasts.
2. High extraction basket. Probably the most important point to trying something like this. HE baskets make everything clearer and more intense. Reduces body usually, but the flavours and high sweetness make this a no-brainer when chasing intensity of flavour.
3. Yes, it's possible with a Niche Zero despite the dogma. Not just possible. I'm very satisfied.

Conclusion: I brew only with beans like these. I believe most variations of a long, saturated preinfusion with a high extraction basket will yield similar results with hard-to-extract coffee.",14,1731393743.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1gpeqsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1gpeqsn/this_is_my_story_part_2/,This is my story. (PART 2),"That night I made the stupid and impulsive decision to ask her on video chat to be my girlfriend. It was stupid because although I wanted it badly, I subconsciously knew it was for a sense of security as well. She stated that we need to get to know each other better, and although I agreed, I selfishly pushed the issue. She agreed and did seem happy at the new label, but it was probably a big mistake doing it that way. The next day she was leaving for her trip. She called me on video chat all dolled up to take her dog to her ex’s house. She said, “I would never try to get him back, but he’s with a new girl and she’s Latina too, so I can’t help but be petty and want to look good when I go there.” I thought this was quite innocent. She left for her trip the next day. This is when shit started to really take a turn. For the first week of her trip, everything seemed fine. We talked, she sent pictures, we video chatted. She even showed me a sexy piece of lingerie that she said she bought for me, but I never saw that thing again after that day. The next week she was a little more distant. I had a funny feeling, but as usually I pushed my negative thoughts to the side. She wouldn’t answer my texts, but I regularly saw her online status active on WhatsApp. I would call and no answer. I would send voice messages, but no reply. When she finally got back to me. I did bring up that I noticed she was online and didn’t receive a reply. She said, “Sometimes WhatsApp shows ‘online’ when running in the background.” I said, “Okay.” and brushed that off as well. It was odd how quickly the online status would appear and disappear. It really got me anxious after a while. The next day she told me she was late for her period. I believed her about never having sex without a condom before. I figured this was just that first time paranoia. I didn’t finish, I didn’t do it for long, and I know I didn’t leak inside her or anything. I assured her that what we did would not cause pregnancy. She was still worried. Days went on and I can’t like I was getting worried too after day five and six. She finally got her period and we were both relieved. One night I told her I was horny for her because we haven’t had a sexy video chat since she went on her trip. She said, “Yes! Please come fuck me really quick so I can go to sleep!” I answered, “I would have to fly to Europe, silly.” And she said, “Oh, yeah. Lol!” I asked if I can get a picture to help me out and she said she was drinking wine in the living room with her friends. I said, “Okay. That’s fine.” After more distance and online activity without answering me, I wondered if she was talking to someone else. I was deep in thought and wondered if she had second thoughts and reconnected with this other guy she stopped dating to date me. It was weighing on my heavy for some reason and I felt so guilty for having those thoughts. The next time I got her on video chat, I was in the middle of talking with her about something when she abruptly hung up. I texted, “Hey, is everything okay?” and got no reply. After seeing the online status flash on and off a few times. I figured I had to be open about these worries. Surely someone that loves me would understand. I somehow got her back on video chat where she displayed another very fake yawn that was even worse then the last time she did this. She said, “Sorry, I fell asleep.” I told her right away that I have an anxious attachment style and would like a little more reassurance at times that everything is all good between us. I told her that I know she is enjoying her trip, but being stuck in room at the halfway house was weighing heavily on my mind and creating a negative thought process. She actually responded very negatively and said, “I actually think we need to take a huge step back because this is a lot. Reassuring someone constantly is draining and this sounds very toxic.” I was shocked. I asked if she was breaking up with me and she said, “I love you, but we should not be in a relationship until you learn to control your emotions.” I said, “Fine. If that’s the way you want it, then I’m done.” She replied, “Okay, so now I am free to do what I want.” I just hung the call up and thought about the reaction I got to communicating my feelings. She replied few minutes later saying, “No this was just a stupid fight. I fucking love you!” I told her that she showed a very cold side I’ve never seen before and it has me feeling some type of way. She assured me we were fine and the days went on. It was more of the same. Distance, no replied, followed my online activity. One day I posted a video of me working out and she asked me, “Why are you working out more all of a sudden?”. I replied, “I always work out. I just don’t always post it. Why do you think I’m doing it for a reason? I think of you when I work out. I hope you like how I take care of myself.” She seemed so skeptical and confused by my behavior and I wondered what that meant. I think I let it go on for the remainder of her trip. I wrote her a simple but cute little welcome back letter in the mail for when she returned. When she was ready to come home, she video called me from the airport crying. She said, “I’m not wife material. I’m the girl that guys meet before they find their wife. I can’t be the girl you want or need.” I told her all of that didn’t matter right now. I just wanted her to be my girlfriend. She said she couldn’t and wanted to break up. I pleaded this time and said, “Why are you doing all this? Is there another interest that you have?” She got mad and said, “No! I can’t believe you think that!” I told her, “I do think that. I actually think \*\*\*\* wants to reconnect and you are considering.” She said, “That’s not true. I don’t talk to him anymore.” I went on to say, “Why were you pushing so hard for me to invest these feelings in the beginning only to do some shit like this?” She started crying and said, “I know! That’s what makes this so hard!”. I gave up and told her, “That’s it then.” When she arrived back at her place, I received a picture of the welcome back letter I sent her while she was away and underneath it she said, “I love you.” The first love bomb of many to come.

I ignored her for three whole days. I even registered on Tinder’s web version, but I didn’t make a full profile or actively search. I just thought maybe something about doing it would numb the pain. It didn’t. All I wanted was her. I remembered her rule about going no contact for three days. On the third day I wrote her a paragraph on WhatsApp. I forgot exactly what I said, but something made me add that I believe she’s battling something deeper than she let’s on. I suspected some kind of mental health issues and remembered she mentioned her Mom had BPD, but I really had no inclination of what she was dealing with. She video called me and said, “Thank you for your words. I need to tell you that I can’t give you the relationship that you want right now.” With very sad eyes. I replied, “That’s okay. I really just want to always know you.” She went on to say, “I feel so empty inside. I think I’m emotionally hurting.” I said, “Do you want to talk about it.” She answered, “Not with you… I think my ex knew it wasn’t going to work out and he just wanted to be with someone by being with me. When I went there to pick up my dog I noticed he took down the painting we made together at a paint & sip date we had. I also gave him a “Best Boyfriend Ever” mug and I was putting dishes in the sink into the dishwasher for him and noticed the words were scratched off the mug. I made that by hand.” I told her, “I’m really sorry your upset. He just wasn’t willing to give you what you need. I wouldn’t think about it too much. Maybe being friends with him is too much.” She didn’t answer. She just smirked. Then smiled bigger and looked into the camera with big happy eyes. Then she said, “Can I tell you about my day now?” I laughed uncontrollably. It was very uncomfortable to be completely honest. Further proving that something wasn’t right. Nonetheless, her smile and happiness meant the world to me. I said, “Sure!”. She went on to tell a story about how she went to New York to see a guy friend and he was an addict. She said when she went to his apartment he had a variety of drugs including “liquid cocaine” which she seemed to get a kick out of because she never heard of such a thing. I said, “A Colombian never heard of liquid Cocaine? How is that even possible?” She laughed the cutest little laugh and said she turned down all the drugs he offered. I did believe her. I still do. This was probably one the most honest feeling I’ve ever had when speaking with her. Then she said, “Look what I bought in Europe!” She proceeded to show me a clover necklace as if I’d know what it was. I said, “That’s pretty.” She said, “Do you want to know how much it was?” and I said, “Sure! I’m guessing a fortune. Haha!” She replied, “It was more than my rent…” then started laughing a really cute laugh. I told her I ordered new clothes for myself on Amazon because when I got to the halfway house I didn’t have much more than black T-Shirts. She said, “Who are you buying new clothes for?” I said, “Myself, but if anyone else, you! I hope you think I look nice.” She got quiet and then she asked me to skip church come over the following Sunday. I agreed. I really wanted to see her. I was so excited to spend time with this girl. She was starting to really light up my life in ways I never imaged possible. Simple smiles and cute little laughs brightened my day. She added that she hasn’t had sex in a while, and I said, “I know. It’s been a month… Right?” She said, “Yes. You were the last, silly.” I smiled playfully and told her I would see her on Sunday.

When Sunday came around I called a friend of mine to drive me after I made my accountability call from the church. Her place was way closer than I thought, but had my friend stand by just in case for time management. I texted her for confirmation and didn’t receive a response. I had a funny feeling already. I signed out of my house and met my friend on a corner and called her from his phone. No answer. I started to really panic. We went to the church for me to make my call and then I called again and she answered. I was so relieved. She sounded a bit off. I told her I am on my way. She said, “I’m not home.” I was like, “Well, we made plans and I am in a very unique situation. You really have to be considerate of my time.” She was all weird and quiet. She said, “I’ll be there in ten minutes. I was getting coffee at a shop in Jersey City.” I replied, “You don’t drink coffee, and why in Jersey City?” She said, “I just like this place.” When I arrived, my friend parked out front. She took a while to get there via Uber and when she finally did, I assume she was in a different area of her building. She called me and I heard a strange panic in her voice asking, “Can you please tell me where you are I don’t see you.” I look back now and realized she thought I was standing her up and was extremely distraught.” I told her where I was and she met me at the door on the other side of her complex. We walked towards her apartment and she saw a guy near the elevator which was located right next to her door. She looked really worried for some reason and said, “Who is that? Is he trying to get in my apartment?” and I looked at her sideways. I said, “No. He’s going to the elevator.” She really looked genuinely nervous about that. I wondered what the hell that was all about. We opened her door and stepped inside. My first thoughts were that I loved this cute little apartment. It was in a luxury building. I actually wondered how she afforded a $2,475 per month studio in a luxury building with amenities such as a pool, game room, and gym while only making $65,000 per year as an uncertified teacher, but whatever. Lol! I said out loud, “Wow! This is cozy! I looked way bigger on video chat.” She looked upset about that. She didn’t want to stay inside for some reason and asked if we could shoot pool in the game room. I said, “Sure!”. We played pool for a little while and I felt a really strange dissociation like as if she didn’t even like pool, but wanted to play it. It was such an off feeling. Thinking back, I felt bad for her. Behind a fake smile it was as if she truly had no interests of her own, but I really had no idea what that meant at the time. We only played one game. I have to admit I was eager to get back to her place to make love and cuddle since she mentioned sex in the video chat when planning this meet. When we were heading up the elevator she looked dead. I went up to her and tried to make out with her and she didn’t open her mouth. I was very concerned and asked, “Why aren’t you opening your mouth?” She didn’t answer. We took the elevator all the way up to the roof instead of her apartment and I decided to just go with the flow. She obviously didn’t want to stay in the apartment for some reason. I asked if we can cuddle on one of the lounges and she sat down but didn’t get too close. She tossed her phone on the cushion and realized the screen was up so with no regard for me witnessing it, she flipped her phone screen down. I couldn’t tell if she was blatantly doing that in front of my face to say something or if she was literally that bad at putting shade on things. This was also the first time of many “screen flips” and poor attempts to hide her phone. I finally convinced her to go back to the apartment and we laid on her bed and I expected to at least cuddle and kiss. She had her head turned away from me and radiated with distant cold energy. I put my arm around her and she said it was too hot in her apartment to cuddle. She said she would change into something comfortable, so when she went to her bathroom I said, “Is it okay if I change too?”. She said, “I don’t have anything for you to wear.” When she came back I was in my boxers. I thought I was being playful, and I suppose she did like it. She was wearing the cutest little pajamas again. This time light crop top with Eeyore from ‘Winnie The Pooh’ on them and short shorts made out of similar light material. I thought she was absolutely adorable. I honestly saw the inner child in her many times. It was enough to pull on my heart strings and reel me back in no matter what. When she got into bed she allowed me to cuddle although had her face focused on the TV screen in the opposite direction of me. I tried to kiss her and be a little more aggressive than I usually am with initiating sex, but she wasn’t open mouth kissing me back. I finally moved down to her neck and kept kissing lower and lower until I got to her belly. She finally pushed me off and I sat there in a bewildered disappointment, not necessarily for being rejected for sex, but because I knew it was more. She immediately said, “Just because I don’t want to have sex doesn’t mean anything is wrong.” I immediately felt guilty. I felt like the typical guy that wants to have sex with the “good girl” who felt pressured. That isn’t the kind of man I am. I told her it was okay. I got dressed and my call time was coming up. I told her about a spoof app that I use on people’s cell phones to make my accountability calls. They can display a number of my choosing like the church I was supposed to be at in order to deviate from my given schedule from time to time. I sat up and reached for her phone and said, “Here. Look! Go to your app store and I’ll show you the one.” She immediately jumped at my reach for her phone. The look on her face was one of absolute HORROR. I’ve actually NEVER seen the look on her face that she gave in that moment. As if she was literally both stabbed and traumatized. She grabbed the phone and held it into her chest and turned away so dramatically, it reminded me of a mother grabbing a newborn from mortal danger. I just looked at her as the look dissipated from her face. I said, “\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, that’s not good… This isn’t right… Something is horribly wrong here.” She said, “Nothing is wrong!”, and decided to present her phone to me. At this point I wasn’t even interested in touching it. Even with her attempt at doing this, it was clear she was mustering up everything inside her to do it. She was even slightly pulling back and giving in to the presentation of her screen uncomfortably with the look of dread creeping in on her face and retreating like as if any moment the worst message notification ever was going to pop up and reveal her secrets. I let it go, kissed her, and left. When I got back to my halfway house, she told me, “I’m sorry. I should’ve let you go through my phone.” I replied, “I didn’t want to go through it. I just want to feel like something isn’t drastically wrong here.” About 20 minutes later she posted an Instagram story of a little pastry in a wrapping with the logo of the Jersey City coffee shop she went to earlier. The song in the background was a chorus with lyrics singing, “Is this real Gangster Love?” with a Latin or Reggaeton beat. This was the first of what I believe to be many cryptic Instagram stories yet to come.

The following days were distant. She would allege sleeping all day on Fridays. She would post Instagram stories about suddenly working out again and the only reason I thought that was a concern is because I remember when I posted work out videos she assumed there was an alternative motive. Does she start working out to show someone new she’s interested in? My thoughts were running wild, and while so farfetched, I couldn’t help wonder why I was having them. It was so strange. They felt so right to have, but theoretically so toxic and wrong. The song in the post was also strange. The lyrics went like this:

'Cause I know that she love me 'cause she told me so  
I feel like dancin', I feel like do-si-do  
Every night, she ride me like a rodeo

Days went on as I will continue to state with every upcoming event. We planned a formal visit at my halfway house the following Sunday morning. She rode her bike all the way to see me and I thought that effort was the sweetest gesture. It was a good visit and we made out occasionally despite being monitored by halfway house staff. I had church scheduled right after the visit and told her she should ride her bike to the church when she leaves and I would meet her there. I walked out of the house only to view her up the street on her bike looking back at me. I really loved this girl. I thought about it as I watched her. So special. So different. I didn’t know what it was exactly and I didn’t care. When I got to the church she was waiting for me. I approached her and she wanted to fix something on her bike so she handed me her phone to hold. The second she gave me it a text message notification popped up from “\*\*\*”. I looked at her and said, “I thought you didn’t speak to him anymore. She said, “I don’t! It’s so strange he texted. It’s the first time since I saw him last when he was sitting on my bed while I when I got out of the shower.” There was a long pause and I said, “I trust you.” We went into the church and it was a really relaxing service. I encouraged her to receive the host even though she never had a communion initiated by the church. Things like that didn’t mean much to me, although Catholic, my spirituality was more of a personal thing to me rather than following traditions to a tee. After service I had a little extra time so we went to the back of a school next to the church. She sat on my lap and we kissed and I had an instant erection. When she felt that I was excited, she knelt down in front of me and asked, “Can I do something?” I knew what was coming and said, “Absolutely.” She pulled my shorts to the side and put me into her mouth for about 5 seconds before saying, “I don’t want people to see!” I urged her they wouldn’t and asked for more, but didn’t get it. I didn’t push the issue and we prepared to depart. We walked hand in hand and she discussed getting confirmed by the church for me. I said there was no rush, but I appreciate the gesture because I would love a potential partner to be able to join me in my faith. As we parted ways she told me, “I applied to this school actually to work closer to you.” I liked hearing that. I said, “That’s great! They might even pay you more!” She replied, “Yeah, but they want me to get certified.” I told her, “Go for it. Take any opportunity to grow and build your career.” We hugged and she left. When she got back home we video chatted as she watched soccer. Colombia was playing someone and she was so into it. She was yelling, “PUTA!” at the TV and I thought it was the cutest thing ever. I asked her what the text from Joe was about and she said he tried to start a conversation by mentioning the upcoming Colombia soccer game. I asked if she replied and she said, “Nope”.

The next day she disappeared for most of the day. I couldn’t reach her and I self-reflected that I am an incarcerated man. I’m technically still locked up and she has a whole life to live out there. I knew I had to chill out and stop my anxious attachment bullshit. She finally video called me that night on the sidewalk all dolled up and looking sexy with a TON of shopping bags. I said, “Where were you?” She said, “I went shopping. I guess I’m trying to fill a void. You don’t want to know how much I spent. Let me show you everything I got.” I said, “Okay.” She was trying on all the clothes she bought and all the designer sunglasses, bags, and accessories. I started to think of how she asked me, “who are you buying new clothes for?” when I told her I ordered clothes for myself. I had intrusive thoughts about there being someone else again and got sad. I had a strong feeling of intuition that told me if she thinks I’m doing certain things for someone else then it probably means when she does some of these things it’s for someone else. I felt so toxic for having these thoughts. I really thought I was emotionally immature from being in prison for so long. I started to believe it was me that was damaging this relationship. We wrapped up our video chat and I went to sleep.

Her birthday was approaching. She informed me that Colombian birthdays are a HUGE deal. She said, “We go ALL OUT, especially girls.” I knew I had to plan something extravagant for her, but with my current confined state it had to be planned perfectly. I started by purchasing myself a cell phone to keep in my locker at school. I had my laptop that the halfway house allows for those in college, but phones are contraband. I figured I needed it to make the appropriate spoof calls with that app I was trying to show her that one time. I eventually told her I got a phone and she seemed really sad about that for some reason. I wasn’t quite sure why. Maybe she was scared of me reconnecting with the world. I bet me being incarcerated gave her a sense of safety. I figured she was hurt before and it affected her. I took everything I could into consideration. Talks of hanging out with my friends started upsetting her for some reason, and I wondered how many friends she actually had. She would always talk about this one friend Kayla. Kayla this and Kayla that. Her Instagram had only about 100 followers and she mostly followed funny video accounts in Spanish or motivational accounts. She followed about 700 of them. I noticed she kept a lot of her ex’s pictures up. She seemed to have a healthy friendship with him. He looked like an average guy. She said he had a very prestigious programming job and make $180,000 per year. Although, in her own words, “Even that much money doesn’t make someone right for you.” I never got the extent of their breakup either. She said he got a vasectomy and that she wanted kids and broke up with him. I asked her if she had sex with him after the vasectomy --(just to see if she’d slip up about saying she never had sex without a condom)—and she said no, that thy weren’t having sex for a while at this point in time. She said he played too many video games and hated that about him. She added that it was ultimately that he didn’t fight to save the relationship when she finally decided to leave. It was confusing to me. Her birthday starting to get closer and I noticed Instagram story posts about being a Virgo and wanting to be genuinely happy on he birthday. She started to get distant again. She wouldn’t respond to me, yet she would post stories about being on a train. Being stuck in the rain with her dog. Random things that really made no sense to be avoiding me. Her birthday was a on Monday. In order to pull this off I would need to leave my internship early that day. I told my boss ahead of time and he said it was no problem. I decided to make her a handmade birthday card—(which I got very good at doing while in prison)—with a drawing of Eeyore from ‘Winne The Pooh’, got her Lyft gift card for $100, and six bottles of wine delivered to her house on that day from a subscription service for one month as a gift. Then I planned to get a red velvet cake—(her favorite)—delivered to my school that day, along with peppered steak with maduros from a Dominican place nearby via Uber Eats. Then I’d place a Door Dash order of balloons, cake toppers, and candles. Lastly, I came up with one of the best ideas of all. Her entire family lived in Colombia, she had no one here. She was essentially living abroad to what she knew to be a home life. I figured her family would mean the world to her on her birthday. I decided to contact them all on social media. I asked them if they would be apart of a WhatsApp video call to sing her happy birthday as a surprise. They agreed and we set a specific time for the call. All was planned! That weekend I noticed she got all dolled up to go out on Friday night. I told her to enjoy herself. She posted a story of a place with a rooftop bar in my hometown that I didn’t know existed. I replied to the story, “That wasn’t there when I was home! Looks neat!” She said, “Yeah, I love this place. Me and the girls are going to go bar hopping after this.” I reiterated, “Enjoy, love!” The next morning, she posted a story of a two wine glasses at a bar. One had hat seemed to be coffee in it and the other white wine. The location said, “NYC Monkey Bar”, and the song that played was in Spanish. As an incarcerated anxious attachment style, I would regularly double check the meanings of these songs to rule out cryptic messages in them. Lol! This is definitely a ME problem, but whatever. I had a gut feeling I couldn’t shake and wanted it gone, so sometimes I would dig deeper. ChatGTP told me the song was about admiration for a “Black Haired Guy” and a conflicting love interest. I have brown hair… Whatever. That morning she messaged me, “How are you?” Often a quote I would feel she would say to me after a night of doing something she was guilty about, or am I crazy? I was starting to feel the uncertainty of myself and my sanity at this point in time. I told her, “Fine. How about you? Did you have a good night?” She never replied. Later that day she video called me and I asked her the same question. She was giddy to tell me a funny story about seeing her ex out to dinner with his new girlfriend and that she was purposefully all obnoxious while saying “Hi.” To him to make them feel uncomfortable. I did think it was cute. This past relationship she had with this guy in particular didn’t threaten me for some reason. It seemed like the only healthy and honest thing she would talk about. The next day she posted an Instagram story that she was at a fancy Italian restaurant. I didn’t reply to the story in case me asking questions of her whereabouts got a little too much for her. Then came another story. A little desert dish that said, “Happy Birthday” was brought out. I couldn’t see any people that were visible in the story though, and that irked the shit out of me. I thought I was losing it. The next day I called her on video chat. We talked about random things until I couldn’t hold it in any longer. “I see you had a nice birthday dinner. Who took you there?” She said, “My friend”. I pressed, “What friend?” She looked up to think. “\*\*\*\*\*\*! … you don’t know my friends, so I didn’t think to just say her name right away. Don’t be jealous.” I told her, “Well, I am. Haha! I have something planned for you on your birthday. I’ll be skipping work to come to your place. I’ll pick you up from a Lyft and we can go back together.” She said, “Okay, that sounds good!”

Monday morning at 12:00am, I sent her a WhatsApp birthday message. She thanked me when she woke up and I told her to have a great day and prepare for a surprise. For a guy in a halfway house with limited time and freedom, I don’t know how I did it. I was running in and out of that college like a maniac chasing down Door Dash drivers that can’t even speak English. Nonetheless, I had all that I needed. I was ready! I got off work and called a friend of mine to drive me instead of a Lyft. He came in a really nice white Jeep, and after a few wrong turns and I could tell she was getting anxious in her text messages. I think the fear of abandonment was acting up again. She really feared I was going to stand her up or something. She was mentioning her dog wasn’t moving on her apartment’s doggie camera. I said, “I’m sure she’s fine. I’m almost there.” When we arrived, she jumped in the jeep and I handed her the card and showed her the food. She thanked me, but wasn’t over the top. That’s okay. I didn’t expect someone to totally blow up with joy over a simply gesture on their birthday. The real surprise was yet to come! I noticed she acted different around my friend. Very supportive and loving. I haven’t got that version of her in a while. Rubbing my arm from the back seat, complimenting me, asking us questions about our friendship. Lately I thought she was a little less interested in me, but with my friend there it all returned in a heartbeat. We arrived at her place and time was ticking. I had to plan this perfectly. I had about 10 minutes until her family was going to make the call. We got inside, I set up the cake, I signed into her WiFi, I set up the laptop—(she thought I just wanted to take a picture with her)—I lit the candles while she opened her wine delivery that arrived that day, and I put the food on the table for afterwards. The moment of truth came. I answered a video call from her Mother, Grandmother, Uncle, and sister. I called her from the kitchen into the center of her studio apartment and showed her who was on call. She held her hands to her mouth and teared. She was EXHILARATED! She was yelling to them in Spanish while crying and looked at me and said, “I can’t believe you did this! This is unbelievable! How in the world did you accomplish this?! I love you so much!”, and she hugged and kissed me. Her family seemed joyous as well. We all started singing happy birthday and she spoke with them a little after and we ended the call. She was in a state of shock, but the joy never left her face. I didn’t have much time left. I had to make my departure call and leave. We ate the food, rushed a piece of cake, and I got ready to leave. After calling a different friend to pick me up, I was still very scared to try and sneak in my cellphone to the halfway house, so I told her I’m leaving it with her and gave her the pass code—(to make her feel safe that I have nothing to hide from her)—and prepared to meet my friend outside her building. My friend came just in time and dropped me off with no issues at all. It was a perfect day. She messaged me on WhatsApp saying, “I can’t believe you did this. You have no idea how much that meant to me. You are the best. I can’t believe we are here after all this time. You told me ‘halfway home’ and I thought, ‘That’s that’, but loved talking to you.” I told her, “I have a little while to be here still, but imagine what I can do when I’m out. I love making you happy, and I plan to for as long as you want.” She replied, “For the rest of our lives!” I was in heaven. I loved giving to her. I loved making her happy. She deserved every ounce of my love. I saw the inner child in her and wanted to spoil that girl until the end of time.",0,1731393699.0,BPDlovedones,0,0.5,False

1gpeocy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gpeocy/aitah_for_being_upset_with_my_friend_over/,AITAH for being upset with my friend over unsolicited advice,"For context : I adopted a senior cat (16F) a few months ago, and while she's been settling in okay she has had a dramatic weight loss. I took her to the vet, tried a bunch of different foods, nothing seems to work. She eats but not enough for her to maintain any weight. Vet recommended I get blood work done to make to see if she has hyperthyroidism, which seems relatively possible. I took some time to see if the shelter I adopted her from had done any bloodwork and also sort out my financial situation (college student paying for everything myself) as bloodwork is quite expensive and a long term treatment for hyperthyroidism would be quite costly as well. I now have her scheduled for her blood work and am hoping that all goes well. 

Let it also be known that I love this cat to bits and pieces. She is an absolute sweetheart, the light of my life and has helped greatly with my mental health. 

Cut to more recently. It's my 21st birthday. My friend asks me to go get coffee with them before we hang out with other friends, I say yes because I want to see them. They've been a good friend for the past two years and I thought they wanted to have some us time because we haven't had a whole lot of time together recently. We go to a cafe and they take the time to tell me that they are deeply concerned about the well-being of my cat. They say they've noticed her getting skinnier every time they've come over (which has been maybe twice in the past month and a half). They don't think she's receiving the care she needs and they don't think I have the financial capacity to take care of her. Then they tell me they want to take her to the emergency vet and then keep her (they already have a cat and live far away and I think that she would be incredibly stressed out by the environment change). I tell them I don't really want to have this conversation on my birthday and they say they don't care. I start crying in the middle of this busy cafe and they comfort me by saying things such as 'I know this cat has been really good for you' and 'I know this has really been weighing on you'. 

After this is over we meet up with friends. I am incredibly anxious and upset but do not want to display this. Things go okay, but later in the day our friend has to leave and I am once again alone with them. They take the opportunity to bring it up again, telling me that they want to take her almost immediately and are already coming up with plans. I tell them that I do not want to talk about it with them, I need time, and I leave. I was hysterically crying the entire way home and was out of it so bad I had a panic attack in my room. My roommate thought somebody had died because I was freaking out so bad. I told both my roommate and my parents about the situation and they agreed I was doing the best I could for my cat and that it was not at all okay for them to bring it up the way they did and especially not on my birthday. 

I thought this person was going to be my friend for life but I'm honestly so upset by this entire situation that I don't know if I can even speak to them again. I appreciate their care for the well-being of my cat and I understand their concern. I'm worried about her too and I'm grappling with the fact that she very well may have to be put to sleep if a solution can't be found. However the way they went about it felt incredibly condescending and hurt me deeply. 

This person is also incredibly privileged in terms of finance, coming from a wealthy family and not having to worry about money. My family has been in an okay financial situation up until recently, as my father was laid off last year and we've been struggling since. I think I've always felt a slight sense of judgement and a bit of a lack of understanding from them, but never heard it expressed. It came quite out of nowhere. 

I felt like I was overreacting to the situation but I genuinely can't tell and it's hard to see past my emotions on this one. ",3,1731393418.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

After extensive testing and a thorough examination, Detective Davidson has been officially cleared of possession.

That’s right, Demon Dan has successfully vacated his system, leaving Dustin with only *slight* psychological damage.

(If you're new, you can find what my therapy sessions have covered: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/s/uy48wEsac9)

He doesn’t remember much about the few hours he was shoved into shotgun or how he ended up getting possessed in the first place. All he’s told me is that he remembers feeling really cold and angry. Overall, it was an unpleasant experience, one he wouldn’t wish upon his own worst enemy.

On a totally unrelated note, the division will be holding a mandatory training seminar on the proper precautions to take to protect against possession in the very near future. Yes, I know it’s a mouthful. It was rather enjoyable to see Lieutenant Dawn struggle to read the memo out as he went around announcing it to everyone.

Salt, iron, holy water, a cross, and The Bible are great basic items to have in your possession at all times. If you’re a little more paranoid, or extreme, there are more *permanent* precautions. Like a protective tattoo for example. There was a certain tv show that circulated it around a couple years ago, now that I think about it.

Dustin is seriously debating getting one of these tattoo’s. He has a couple on his forearms that I’ve seen on occasion when his sleeves are pushed up. A purple butterfly and a rose I think. They’re small, but I’m sure meaningful. It might also just be an excuse to get another tattoo though, the symbol is pretty cool looking not gonna lie. That, or he’s more irked by that experience than he’s letting on.

As you can see, we take possession and more importantly precaution, very seriously at the Winchester Police Department Supernatural’s Division. Here, it will literally save your life if you come prepared for anything that might jump out and attack you.

I’m back at work, by the way, if that weren’t obvious already. How’s it going?

Well, if you were to ask me which supernatural cases I hate dealing with the most, I’d say anything involving vampires. They’re gruesome creatures, ruthless and cut throat. They’re even rarer than sirens, so when one pops up it’s a whole annoying mess to deal with. Like an actual mess. When a particularly out of control vampire feeds, it turns into a bloodbath.

And lucky me, I just can’t catch a fucking break. As soon as I set foot back in the precinct, Davidson and I were handed the case of a suspected supernatural serial killer.

In layman’s terms, three murders that share common characteristics and have a cool down period between each kill can be classified as serial murders. The first two victim’s, an older woman and a young man, were all drained of blood and their throats ripped out- classic vampire M.O. The most recent murder of a little girl made three. Like I said, I *hate* vampires.

Dustin and I got to the scene a little after three pm, taking over for the first responding officer. The girl’s body had been found in an alleyway, resting by an overflowing dumpster. The crime scene was cordoned off with that classic yellow tape, a small gathering of curious bystanders on the other side, balancing on the tips of their toes in hopes of seeing something.

The girl’s skin was pale and her little shirt was drenched in blood, throat torn to shreds. Her eyes had glazed over, the life completely drained from them. A permanent expression of terror frozen on her face as her mouth hung open from screaming out her last breath. To throw salt in the wound, a pesky fly crawled in and out of her mouth and on the skin of her face.

She’d been exsanguinated of blood, so lividity wouldn’t be an indicating factor of time of death here. But, based on the fact her jaw still hung open, Rigor Mortis hadn’t set in yet. The stench of sickly sweet iron was too strong for this to have occurred a day or two ago. That meant the body had been fresh, killed only a couple hours ago.

A vamp killing in broad daylight. Bold, but not entirely unheard of.

Lana was the girl’s name. It was written on her purple backpack. There was one of those emergency contact cards in there with the parent’s information as well.

I stood there staring down at the little girl as  a pair of blue latex gloves snapped on the skin on my hands. The background noise of the crime scene investigators, other officers, bystanders, cars, even the nature around the city seemed to fade into nothing the longer I concentrated on Lana. It was just me and her in the world, nobody else.

She reminded me a bit of myself at that age, probably because of the long black hair she had tied up into a ponytail. I also had a purple backpack in elementary school.

A tear slid down my cheek as I mourned for the girl. Lana was so young, had her whole life ahead of her, only for it to be ripped away in an instant. Her promising life in exchange to keep a greedy monster’s appetite at bay. Despicable. She was just a kid walking home from school.

A hot flash of rage swept through my body.

Then a facial muscle in her cheek twitched. Startled, I jumped back, screaming, **“No!”**

After my outburst, the activity around the busy crime scene ceased, everyone’s eyes pointed at me. My partner dropped what he was doing and made his way over to me.

I took multiple steps back, my eyes trained on the unmoving corpse. Uncontrollable tears gushed down my face. Panic gripped my heart, like a vice. Quick shallow breaths left my lungs. My head was spinning. It felt like I was going to die.

Thanks to all my therapy sessions, I recognized it as a panic attack.

Needing to remove myself from the situation, I ducked under the crime scene tape and booked it back to the liftback- Dustin en tow.

I slammed the passenger door shut and locked the car, rolling down my window to let the fresh air in. A slight breeze whooshed in, settling my nerves a little.

Dustin leaned against the vehicle with one arm resting on top of the roof and the other on his hip. He looked down at me with concern. “You good?”

“I will be,” I said with a shuddering breath. My wrists flailed around erratically as I attempted to shake the shock out of my system. I wiped drying tears off my face with my sweaty palms after taking the gloves off.

Dustin pat the top of the liftback twice. “Okay,” he said nonchalantly, walking back over to the crime scene.

Detective Davison was a dear and conducted interviews while I calmed down in his car. Then, together we went around to the surrounding local businesses and requested they hand over any CCTV footage they might have.

While most of the owners were happy to oblige, a couple of them told us to fuck off and come back with a warrant. God, I love small town Michigan. The grit on some of these folks reminded me of the Windy City.

With witness statements, interview notes, and a good bit of security tapes to sift through, Dustin and I headed back to the comfort of the precinct.

The first couple minutes of the car ride were silent. “What was that back there?” Davidson asked, breaking it.

I clicked my tongue against the roof of my mouth. “Would you believe it if I said it was first day back jitters?”

He shot me a quick, stern, glance. “Lucky…”

“I don’t want to talk about it,” my whole body shifted away from him and his gaze as my neck turned to face out the window. I crossed my arms and huffed.

Dustin sighed before he sincerely said, “If you ever *do* want to talk about it, I’m here.”

“Are you ever going to tell me what you really went through while you were possessed?” I mumbled into my chest. After peeking over my shoulder, I found him looking stone faced with his lips pressed together in a hard line.

An awkward silence filled the air between us. The tension grew so thick, you could cut it with a knife.

Then Clair de Lune, Dustin’s ringtone, started playing. He fumbled for a second, reaching around for his phone while keeping his eyes on the road. I rolled my eyes before leaning over and grabbing it out of the center console for him.

“Hey,” Dustin said as he answered the phone, putting it on speaker, “are you thinking what we’re thinking?”

“A vampire? Possibly, yes,” Jane’s semi-muffled voice rang out. Just like his car, Dustin’s phone was old. His model was a good two, three, maybe ten updates behind modern technological standards. “But there’s also the possibility it could be-“

“No,” Dustin cut her off. I shook my head in agreement. Nobody wanted the alternative to be the case. *Especially* me.

A slightly offended pause came from the phone. “I was just saying it’s a possibility. But, yeah, the supernatural we’re most likely dealing with here is a vampire.”

“Great,” I said unenthusiastically, earning yet another glare from my partner.

“Well we’re on our way back to the precinct now,” he informed. “The three of us can sit down and create a profile when we get there.”

“Alrighty then,” Jane said chipperly, “see you soon.” She then promptly hung up the phone.

The rest of the car ride was drowned out with the stale sound of FM radio.

Back at the precinct Jane, Dustin, and I met up and sat down in one of the conference rooms to start working on this profile. Files and papers were scattered and askew all over the large table as we searched for our killers pattern or something to tie the victims together.

Our victims were an old woman, a young man, and a child. Most vampires either have a specific type of person/gender they prefer to drink from. They also typically target almost middle aged to young folk since they tend to be the healthiest of the crop, so to speak. A small portion of the species, however, will drink from anything that lives and breathes. These cretins are the ones we come in contact with most. Based on what we already had, we knew we were dealing with one of the less civilized vamps.

We just needed some sort of connection between the victims that could lead to clues or a pattern that would identify our suspect.

The first victim, Gladys Stokes, was a sixty-five year old widow. Since her kids were all off living their own lives, she spent most of her time down at the animal shelter volunteering. Last week she was found with her throat torn out behind the shelter. Initially, her death was ruled as an animal attack because of the brutality and bite marks. There’s a big wolf and coyote population that live in the woods that surround Winchester. Occasionally, they’re prone to attack, especially if they feel like their territory is being threatened. The animal shelter is located on the edge of the woods so this was a pretty plausible explanation. However, the division would re-open her case and start a death investigation once the serial killer struck again.

Twenty-four year old Shane Embers was the second victim. His body was found in one of the student labs at the hospital with injuries consistent with Gladys a couple days later. Throat ripped to pieces and drained of blood. The coroner highly doubted that a wolf would be able to get inside the hospital, kill a nursing student, and get out completely unnoticed. That’s when he notified Lieutenant Dawn of a possible supernatural going around killing people.

Then of course there’s Lana…

The first connection we ruled out was that they were blood relatives. None of the victims lived remotely close or even knew each other. The next connection to go was religion. Embers was an adamant atheist and Gladys and Lana’s churches were on the opposite side of town.

Pretty much nothing connected our vic’s to one another. This guy was seriously starting to remind me of The Night Stalker.

Jane was definitely the most frustrated out of all of us. She was hardly ever stumped when it came to profiling. It came as easy and natural to her as breathing.

“O-kay! Who wants coffee?” I yelled out nervously after Jane slammed her fist on the conference table particularly hard. The woman was elegant and poise, very rarely did she get temperamental. At least that’s what I’ve noticed in the time since I’ve been here.

Jane didn’t get a choice, she was getting coffee. Dustin, who was nose deep in a file, waved me off. I shrugged my shoulders and left the room.

Lieutenant Dawn cornered me in the kitchen as I brewed Jane’s cup. “How you feeling?” He asked.

I shrugged, pouring a couple table spoons of sugar in my empty mug. “Better.”

Dawn took a step back after he heard my answer, easing the intimidating presence I felt breathing down my neck. “Anything you wanna tell me?”

“Nope,” my lips made a popping sound as I pronounced the p. The coffee machine beeped as Jane’s mug finished brewing. I switched her mug out for mine, adding nothing in hers since she takes it black.

Dawn reached for the cabinet above my head, grabbing an oatmeal cream pie from the snack bin. He ripped open the plastic packaging and took a bite, taking half of the treat with him.

“You will tell me if something happens, right? To you, your partner, even if something bothers you and it’s the smallest thing?”

A forced smile made its way into my face as I turned to my superior. I gave the man a quick two finger salute “Yes sir. I wouldn’t be doing my due diligence if I didn’t.”

Dawn stifled a laugh and rolled his eyes. He ruffled my hair up before walking off with his sweet treat, like he was my dad.

I let out a sigh of relief as I fixed the new flyaways my lieutenant had given me. The space felt more comfortable now that I was alone in it. A good amount of cream was poured into my mug before I carefully made my way back to the conference room.

“Aha!” Jane shouted victoriously, jumping up and down excitedly as I pushed the door to the conference room open with my shoulder.

Dustin threw the file he was reading down in surprise, clearly startled. “What? Did you find something?”

Jane accepted the warm cup of coffee with two hands graciously. She took a small sip with a fat grin. “Yes, I did, because I’m a genius!”

“You wanna share with the class?” I asked, closing the door and taking a seat. Sweet with a slight hint of bitter coffee slid down my throat, making my tummy very happy. “What did you find?”

“They’re all innocent!” Jane proclaimed, gathering up and throwing all three of our victims files open next to each other in the center of the table.

“Yeah, none of them had a criminal record,” Dustin said, leaning back in his chair. “So…?”

Jane crumpled up a blank piece of paper and chucked it at Dustin’s head. It hit his temple and ricocheted onto the floor. I laughed into my mug as I took another sip.

“The victims were morally innocent, ya dummy!” She explained. “An old woman who volunteered at an animal shelter, a young man who was studying health to help save lives, a pure of heart kindergartner that wouldn’t hurt a fly! Can’t you see it?”

“No,” Dustin said flatly. “You look kinda crazy right now.”

“Yeah,” I said, drowning Davidson’s dull answer out. “Whatever killed these people is pretty evil.” My heart sunk to the bottom of my stomach after I said that.

The division’s profiler snapped her fingers. “Exactly! These murders are so gruesome and so evil, and factoring in the victim’s innocence-“

“You can’t seriously be suggesting-“ I cut in.

Jane finished my sentence. “A revenant? Yes, that’s exactly what I’m suggesting. Our victims weren’t killed by a vampire, but a revenant!”

Revenants are a subspecies of vampires. Something goes wrong when they turn and they lose all sense of humanity and become nothing but hungry bottomless pits.

They’re worse than ghouls. They’re worse than *vampires*, and I *hate* vampires! They’re the scum of the earth. Some of the evilest, vilest, creatures on this plane of existence.

“In Winchester? *Really?*” Dustin scoffed, unbelievably.

“Why not?” Jane shrugged her shoulders suggestively and sat down. “There was one in a town only a couple hours away from here last year. That one was a serial killer too.”

I gulped. “What happened to them?”

“Well the murders stopped, so either they were captured and killed by that department’s supernatural division or he skipped town.”

Our very productive conversation was suddenly interrupted by a frantic knock on the conference room door. One of the secretaries cautiously poked her head through and addressed the room. “Detective Davison? Officer Hale? I have a lady on the line who is adamant that she speak with someone handling this case.”

“Is it urgent?” Dustin asked with a yawn.

The secretary nodded her head. “To her it is.”

Dustin sighed and started pulling himself up in his chair.

“I’ll handle it,” I said suddenly, getting up and greeting our colleague at the door. “You guys keep working on that theory.”

I then followed her to the front desk to take the phone call.

I owed it to him for taking over the crime scene earlier. Clearly he didn’t want to talk to this woman on the phone. I didn’t mind the work as this would make things fair between us. Besides, Dustin could sit through one of Jane’s yapping sessions for once. And I love how he squirms when he’s irritated, bored, and uninterested.

“This is Officer Hale, how can I help you?” I spoke into the receiver after Janine, the secretary, handed me the office phone.

“Hi, yes? I think I have information on the individual who might be responsible for some of these killings.”

“You *think* you have information, or you have information?”

The callers breath hitched in her throat, but she quickly regained herself. “I have information. I know who the killer is.”

“What’s your name, Miss? And how do you know who the killer is?” I asked, getting a pen and pad ready.

“W-well, I don’t *know* know who the killer is,” she started, “I just saw him leave the area where that little girl was found. My name is Sage Walker by the way.”

I started scribbling down her information and taking notes. “Can I get your description of the perpetrator, ma’am?”

I’d ask her why she waited so long to call this in later. Winchester is a small town so the news of local’s deaths spreads like wildfire. It was very possible she saw something suspicious but thought nothing of it at the time, only to find out later she could be a key witness.

“H-he’s a brown skinned man, about five foot five or five foot six. Dark, short hair. He was wearing dark jeans, black flannel and a light gray undershirt and was *covered* in blood!” Sage explained frantically over the phone. The more she talked the more worked up she got. She sounded really concerned.

As she continued to walk me through the man’s description, my free ear clued into the sounds surrounding the lobby.

The front door to reception slowly creeped open, heavy footsteps shuffled inside slowly.  The secretaries and other people in the lobby gasped.

“I’m here to turn myself in. I… I think I hurt someone.”

My gaze flicked to the person as their words registered in my head.

“I-I’m going to have to call you back,” I said before promptly hanging up the phone. It was like the person Ms. Walker just described had walked right out of the phone and into the precinct.

The man’s mouth and chin were stained with dry blood. His tanned skin, pale, drenched in sweat. A flannel over shirt was tied around his waste. Giant brown stains covered both the garment and his light gray undershirt. Over all the man looked, and smelled, like death.

Quickly, I raised my gun out of my holster and pointed it at the man’s head. “Get down on your knees, now!” I commanded sternly. “Put your hands behind your back!”

Sheepishly, the man did as I said. His eyes darted around the room nervously, looking extremely uncomfortable and more importantly, guilty.

That rage from earlier started bubbling up in my gut again.

After detaining him, I’d brought the man to one of our special interrogation rooms. We were as safe and secure as we could be in there. The walls were reinforced with a mix of galvanized steel and iron. All of the supernaturals were restrained using silver handcuffs. A tough and sturdy chain bound him to the interrogation table, which was welded into the ground. For extra precaution, I’d slipped some silver ankle cuffs on his legs in case he somehow managed to free himself.

An hour of interrogation later and we’d gotten absolutely nowhere.

The suspect claims he has no memory of who he is or how he got here. He seems to not even realize what he is. All he knows is that he blacks out sometimes. This last time he woke up covered in blood. Knowing what he did was bad, instinct told him to turn himself in. That’s about as far as we got before he started shutting down.

“Is this really necessary?” He asked as one of the forensic technicians scrapped dry blood off of his shirt for testing. A field test concluded the substance  was blood. Another test needed to be conducted in the lab to confirm whether it was human or not. He was then stripped of his bloodied clothes, the fabric being logged in as evidence.

“Yes,” I answered. Then, by my request, The technician carefully lifted up his lip using a gloved pinky finger, revealing a pair of sharper than normal canines.

“Are you sure he’s a revenant?” Dustin asked, leaning close and whispering. “He seems awfully… *there.* And his humanity seems to be intact.”

Right as Dustin said that, he lost control of himself. Our suspect snapped his jaw as the technician removed their hand from his mouth. If the appendage had poked around in there a second longer he’d surely have lost it. A guttural snarl left the suspects mouth as a string of drool started to drip off his lips. The technician quickly gathered their kit and got out of there, hungry eyes following them the entire time.

After a moment, our suspect shook his head, snapping himself out of whatever trance he had gone into. He stared down at his hands shamefully. “Sorry.”

Vampires are rare, revenants even rarer. But a lucid one? Now that’s completely unheard of.

But there I was, staring one in the eyes. They were bloodshot and his pupils were dilated. I’d come across a revenant once before… his eyes were the same.

An unwanted image flashed in my mind. I blinked and shook the memory away. “So what should we call you, revenant?” I asked, leaning over the table to get a better analysis on him.

The man squirmed in his seat under my watchful gaze. Then, timidly, he thought on it for a few seconds before responding, “I’ve always liked the name Rudy?”",6,1731393313.0,nosleep,1,0.75,False

I chose Bumble over tinder and hinge as I wanted to pick an app more geared towards finding a long term relationship I wrote a bio about my interests made it clear I'm seeking a LTR and that I wanted to have kids. I swiped on people with similar profiles. 

My problem wasn't getting matches. Or having conversations. Or building rapport etc. My problem was that the women I matched with always seemed way too busy to meet up. 

In one instance, I had someone (a couple of years older) reach out to me. 3 or 4 messages back and forth, then I asked her out for a coffee. I did get a response until 3 days later ""sorry I've been so flat out I've started a 2nd job this week coffee sounds great but I'm booked up for 3 weeks"". I was like wtf this person already has a well paying job (psychologist) They lived in a fancy ass area too why are they making themselves more busy than they need to be and they should have the self awareness to realise they are too busy to date and should stop wasting people's time. 

This is just one example I had several others too. 

After the 5th time or so that this happened I got pissed off, said goodbye to the matches I was talking too and deleted my profile. 

This whole experience has left me frustrated with little hope that there is someone out there who will show me they are enthusiastic/excited to get to know me, will make time for me/in some ways prioritize me, will reply to messages within a suitable time frame, doesn't try playing the unnecessary game of chase etc. 

I guess in part I just wanted to vent but also open to advice because I still have a big girlfriend shaped hole in my life and I'm genuinely ready for something long term.

In fact I am hoping that espresso drinkers are the superior class of coffee enjoyers, who are not intimidated by someone asking a few questions or having a different opinion. 

Whenever I drink espresso, my face shrivels up in disgust. There's not enough sugar in the world to make it palatable to me, so I water it down with cream. There's just something about the taste. You ever drink gas station coffee? That's how all coffee tastes to me. Especially espresso. Like it was scraped off a burner and diluted with charcoal. I'm not trying to be mean, I just can't help but look down on you all for enjoying it. Tea is certainly the better beverage (although funny enough, I have been banned from r/Tea as well).

After I got back up to about 170 I started learning about intuitive eating, I stopped binging and maintained my weight for about 2 years.

I know what you say “have to be confident now, or you never will” NAH. I felt amazing when I was vegan, I felt more confident, I felt seen. It’s different.

My team and I have bootstrapped an education company from 5k to nearly $1M revenue in 2 years.  
But I've had some other business ideas that **failed BIG time**.

This is what this post is about and how to avoid that failure.

So, I did try SaaS, even Dropshipping, Amazon FBA, and more. **ALL failed.**

And i hope this post helps you to not do the same mistakes that i did when i asked myself ""what online business can i start?""

I've failed not because these models or ideas of business don't work - but because I've never actually **VALIDATED if there is actually real demand for this.**

I call this the classic rookie mistake for first time founders.  
And I've fallen into the trap multiple times tbh. **(5x to be exact!)**

I've never talked to real breathing human beings one-to-one if they **really** **needed** **this and would spend money on it**.

So I've blew money that i did not have, a lot of time and energy into a thing that i've build - but - surprise, surprise -nobody wanted it.

However is reading this thinking about starting something new I truthfully hope this will not happen to you - now you know this pitfall!

**So what can we learn from this?**  
Whatever business model or market you pick, make sure you **validate first**.

Validation is just a fancy word for making sure people are **interested** in something(your product/service) - **before** your building your product/service.

Let me say this again:

**Validate First.**  
**Build Second**

And we want to validate **CHEAP** and **FAST**.

ok, but how we do that?

**Here's what the smart people do:**

Before spending a single dollar, create what I call a ""*Smoke Test*""

When plumbers fix pipes, they pump smoke through them first.

If there's a leak, you'll see the smoke before any water damage happens. - Easy.

And in business, it's the same concept:

You're testing for ""leaks"" in your business idea before pouring in real money (water)

**Example:**  
Let's say you wanna do a premium coffee delivery subscription service. Ok Great.

Instead of buying inventory and spending your 5k right away, you create a simple landing page that says  
""*Rare Premium Coffee Beans Delivered Monthly to you home* *-* ***Join the Waitlist*** ""

There are **2 ways** to do that:

***You Spend Money:***  
*Now run $50 worth of Facebook ads to your target audience. (paid)*

*If your don't want to spend any* ***money*** *- you have to spend* ***time***.

***You Spend Time:***  
find your people online and tell them something like ""*hi, i'm thinking about to start a monthly Rare Coffee Beans Delivery -- would you be interested -* ***join the waitinglist***""

If 100 people view your page and nobody signs up - you've saved yourself $4,950. - happy days - good for you.

If 30-40 people join your waitlist - you've got **proof of interest - and a business.**

This is exactly what Dropbox did - they made a video showing their ""product"" before writing a single line of code. Or a more recent example is Elon Musk and his Cybertruck.

Dropbox collected 75,000+ email addresses overnight. **(and they did not even wrote a single line of code yet)**

Elon Musk collected idk how many emails + 100millions deposits of people overnight. (and he did not build a sigle truck yet)

That's validation for **true** **demand**.

So all we do is simply and cheaply collect signs of interest before we get moving.

I feel like a lot pf people are missing this step.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right size for your tiny house is a personal decision, influenced by a mix of practical considerations and lifestyle choices. With numerous options available, understanding what factors play a role in determining the best fit for you is crucial. Let's explore these essential aspects.

### Assess Your Needs

Understanding your needs is the first step in identifying the ideal tiny house size. Consider the following factors:

- **Living Arrangements:** Will you live alone, with a partner, or with family? The number of occupants greatly affects the size you will need.
- **Work from Home:** If you work from home, think about how much office space you require.
- **Storage Requirements:** Do you have hobbies or collections that require additional storage? Estimate how much space you'll need for your belongings.

### Utilizing Space Efficiently

Efficient use of space is one of the benefits of tiny living. You may think a smaller space limits you, but with clever design, you can maximize what you have. Consider features such as:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/which-size-tiny-house-do-you-need?  
  
- **Multi-Functional Furniture:** Choose furniture that serves multiple purposes, like a bed that folds into a couch.
- **Vertical Storage:** Installing shelves and cabinets that go up to the ceiling can dramatically increase your storage options without taking up floor space.
- **Outdoor Living:** If your tiny house includes an outdoor area, you can extend your living space and utilize the outdoors.

### Consider Your Lifestyle

Your lifestyle plays a significant role in the size of your tiny house. Reflect on the following:

- **Social Life:** Do you enjoy hosting gatherings? A larger common area might be beneficial for entertaining.
- **Cooking Habits:** If you're a passionate cook, you may need a bigger kitchen space with adequate storage and prep areas.
- **Privacy Needs:** Consider how much privacy you and others need, especially in shared living situations.

### Budget Considerations

Your budget can significantly influence the size of the tiny house you choose. Here are a few financial aspects to keep in mind:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/which-size-tiny-house-do-you-need?  
  
- **Buying vs. Building:** If you're purchasing a pre-built tiny house, the size could directly affect the price. Custom builds will allow you to dictate size but often come at a premium.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Larger tiny houses might have increased heating, cooling, and maintenance costs. Assess how much you’re willing to spend in the long run.
- **Land Considerations:** Ensure your chosen land can accommodate the size of your tiny house, both in terms of zoning laws and space availability.

### Legal and Zoning Requirements

Before finalizing the size of your tiny house, you must check any local laws and regulations. Look into:

- **Zoning Laws:** Different areas may have specific requirements or restrictions on the size of homes. Some regions have minimum square footage, while others might restrict tiny homes altogether.
- **Building Codes:** Your tiny house must comply with local building codes for safety and legal reasons.

### Future Considerations

As you plan for your tiny house, think about your future needs:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/which-size-tiny-house-do-you-need?  
  
- **Potential Family Expansion:** If you foresee expanding your family, consider a slightly larger space.
- **Changing Lifestyles:** Your lifestyle preferences can change. For example, if you start a new hobby, you may need additional space.

Determining the right size for your tiny house entails careful consideration of various factors impacting your life. By assessing your needs, utilizing space efficiently, considering your lifestyle, and reviewing financial and legal aspects, you will be well-equipped to make an informed decision. Tailor your choice to create a comfortable and functional living space, allowing you to enjoy the unique lifestyle tiny house living offers.

Maximizing Space Efficiency in Various Tiny House Sizes
-------------------------------------------------------

When considering a tiny house, one of the most crucial decisions is determining the right size for your needs. Every square foot matters, and effectively maximizing space efficiency can greatly enhance your living experience. Let's explore how various tiny house sizes can be optimized for comfort and functionality.

### Understanding the Size Options

Tiny houses typically range from 100 to 400 square feet. Knowing how to utilize these spaces efficiently is essential, regardless of the size you choose. Here’s a breakdown of common tiny house sizes and how you can maximize space:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/which-size-tiny-house-do-you-need?  
  
- **Under 200 square feet:** Ideal for individuals who prioritize minimalism. Use foldable furniture and wall-mounted shelves to create more space.
- **200 to 300 square feet:** Suitable for couples or small families. Consider a multi-functional living area that serves as both a dining space and a lounge.
- **300 to 400 square feet:** Offers more flexibility with room for designated areas. Use sliding doors to separate spaces without taking up extra room.

### Utilizing Vertical Space

Regardless of the size of your tiny house, vertical space is often underutilized. Here are some strategies to maximize this area:

- **High Shelving:** Install shelves high on the walls to store books, decor, or kitchen supplies. This keeps items accessible while maximizing floor space.
- **Bunk Beds:** In larger tiny homes, consider bunk beds for sleeping arrangements. This allows you to free up floor space for other uses.
- **Loft Spaces:** Create loft areas for sleeping or storage. Ensure adequate safety measures like guardrails are in place to prevent falls.

### Furniture Considerations

The right furniture can significantly impact how well you utilize your tiny house's space. Consider these tips:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/which-size-tiny-house-do-you-need?  
  
- **Multi-Use Items:** Look for furniture that serves more than one purpose. A sofa bed can provide seating by day and sleeping space by night.
- **Foldable Options:** Use folding tables and chairs. These can be stored away when not in use, freeing up valuable space.
- **Built-In Furniture:** Consider built-in seating or benches with storage beneath. It provides a sleek look while maximizing functionality.

### Kitchen Efficiency

In a tiny house, the kitchen can often feel cramped. To alleviate this issue, focus on the following:

- **Compact Appliances:** Invest in smaller, space-saving appliances that still meet your cooking needs. For instance, a microwave-convection oven combo can serve multiple functions.
- **Pull-Out Cabinets:** Use pull-out cabinets or pantry spaces to access items easily without opening several doors.

### Creative Storage Solutions

Storage is a critical factor in any tiny house size. Here are unique solutions to maintain organization:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/which-size-tiny-house-do-you-need?  
  
- **Under-Stair Storage:** If your tiny house has stairs, utilize the space underneath for storage bins or a small closet.
- **Hidden Compartments:** Optimize space by incorporating hidden compartments within furniture, like a coffee table that opens up for storage.
- **Mobile Storage:** Use rolling carts for storage, as they can be moved around as needed while providing easy access to frequently used items.

### Lighting and Color Choices

Never underestimate the importance of lighting and color in maximizing space efficiency. Light colors can create an illusion of a larger area while ample natural light can make a small space feel welcoming. Here are a few impactful strategies:

- **Large Windows:** Incorporate large windows to bring in natural light and provide a feeling of openness.
- **Light Paint Colors:** Use light colors for walls and ceilings to reflect light and create a brighter atmosphere.

Choosing the right size tiny house isn't just about square footage; it's also about how you utilize the space within it. By implementing these strategies tailored to the size of your tiny home, you can create a living space that is not only functional but also comfortable and inviting.

### Conclusion

Choosing the right size for your tiny house is not just about square footage; it’s a decision that hinges on your lifestyle, needs, and goals. As you’ve seen, various factors come into play, such as the number of occupants, your storage requirements, and how often you entertain guests. By carefully assessing these aspects, you can determine the ideal size that complements your daily life, whether that means opting for a compact studio or a spacious two-bedroom layout.

Maximizing space efficiency is equally crucial, regardless of the size you select. Ingenious design choices, like multipurpose furniture and vertical storage solutions, can transform even the smallest spots into functional retreats. Understanding how to optimize the available area will help you make the most out of every square inch. The key is to strike a balance between comfort and practicality.

Ultimately, the size of your tiny house should reflect your personal style and lifestyle needs. Consider how you plan to use the space, both alone and with others. Will you work from home or host gatherings? Answering these questions will guide you toward what truly fits your lifestyle. Embrace the journey of finding your perfect tiny home size; it’s about creating a space that feels just right for you while reflecting your values of simplicity and intentional living. Remember, a tiny house isn’t just about size; it’s about making every corner count and creating a cozy haven you adore.

1gpeden,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur/comments/1gpeden/how_to_validate_any_business_idea_before_building/,How to validate ANY business idea before building (and wasting time and money on it),"**Experienced Founder/ CEO here.**

My team and I have bootstrapped an education company from 5k to nearly $1M revenue in 2 years.  
But I've had some other business ideas that **failed BIG time**.

This is what this post is about and how to avoid that failure.

So, I did try SaaS, even Dropshipping, Amazon FBA, and more. **ALL failed.**

And i hope this post helps you to not do the same mistakes that i did when i asked myself ""what online business can i start?""

I've failed not because these models or ideas of business don't work - but because I've never actually **VALIDATED if there is actually real demand for this.**

I call this the classic rookie mistake for first time founders.  
And I've fallen into the trap multiple times tbh. **(5x to be exact!)**

I've never talked to real breathing human beings one-to-one if they **really** **needed** **this and would spend money on it**.

So I've blew money that i did not have, a lot of time and energy into a thing that i've build - but - surprise, surprise -nobody wanted it.

However is reading this thinking about starting something new I truthfully hope this will not happen to you - now you know this pitfall!

**So what can we learn from this?**  
Whatever business model or market you pick, make sure you **validate first**.

Validation is just a fancy word for making sure people are **interested** in something(your product/service) - **before** your building your product/service.

Let me say this again:

**Validate First.**  
**Build Second**

And we want to validate **CHEAP** and **FAST**.

ok, but how we do that?

**Here's what the smart people do:**

Before spending a single dollar, create what I call a ""*Smoke Test*""

When plumbers fix pipes, they pump smoke through them first.

If there's a leak, you'll see the smoke before any water damage happens. - Easy.

And in business, it's the same concept:

You're testing for ""leaks"" in your business idea before pouring in real money (water)

**Example:**  
Let's say you wanna do a premium coffee delivery subscription service. Ok Great.

Instead of buying inventory and spending your 5k right away, you create a simple landing page that says  
""*Rare Premium Coffee Beans Delivered Monthly to you home* *-* ***Join the Waitlist*** ""

There are **2 ways** to do that:

***You Spend Money:***  
*Now run $50 worth of Facebook ads to your target audience. (paid)*

*If your don't want to spend any* ***money*** *- you have to spend* ***time***.

***You Spend Time:***  
find your people online and tell them something like ""*hi, i'm thinking about to start a monthly Rare Coffee Beans Delivery -- would you be interested -* ***join the waitinglist***""

If 100 people view your page and nobody signs up - you've saved yourself $4,950. - happy days - good for you.

If 30-40 people join your waitlist - you've got **proof of interest - and a business.**

This is exactly what Dropbox did - they made a video showing their ""product"" before writing a single line of code. Or a more recent example is Elon Musk and his Cybertruck.

Dropbox collected 75,000+ email addresses overnight. **(and they did not even wrote a single line of code yet)**

Elon Musk collected idk how many emails + 100millions deposits of people overnight. (and he did not build a sigle truck yet)

That's validation for **true** **demand**.

So all we do is simply and cheaply collect signs of interest before we get moving.

I feel like a lot pf people are missing this step.

Hope this is valuable to you! :",3,1731392144.0,Solopreneur,0,1.0,False
