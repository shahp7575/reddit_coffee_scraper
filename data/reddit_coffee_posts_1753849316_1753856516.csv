After four years of a quiet marriage to Carter Leon, we were finally having a baby. I thought this was the final piece of our story.

But when I went to the county clerk's office for a certified copy of our marriage certificate, I was told there was no record of our marriage. Instead, Carter was legally married to Erlene Fulton, my estranged stepsister and his high school sweetheart.

My world shattered.

I was nothing more than a mistress, a placeholder.

Then, my family, including Carter, pressured me to ""step aside"" for Erlene, who was supposedly dying and wished to die as Carter's wife. I refused, revealing my pregnancy, only to be locked away by my father and stepmother. Carter later convinced me it was all a charade, a performance for a dying woman.

I watched him marry Erlene, a ghost at their grand wedding. He spent his time with her, while I, like a fool, kept believing his lies. Until I overheard Erlene and Carter. He confessed he had always loved her, and that marrying me was just a plan to wound her pride and make her return.

My four years, my devotion, my love-all a calculated move. I was a pawn, and so was my baby. The promises, the soft touches, the shared smiles-all fake.

How could I have been so blind?

How could he be so cruel?

I had to save myself, and my child, from this poison.

I ran, determined to leave the lie behind.

Chapter 1

The pregnancy test showed two pink lines. I stared at them, my heart pounding in my chest. Four years. Four years of a careful, quiet marriage to Carter Leon, and now, finally, a baby. Our baby.

I thought this would be the thing that cemented us, the final piece of our story.

""We'll need a certified copy of our marriage certificate for the hospital pre-registration,"" I told Carter that evening, my voice light with happiness.

He was reading a financial report, but he looked up and smiled. It was a real smile, the kind that reached his eyes, the kind it had taken me years to earn.

""Of course,"" he said. ""Whatever you need. Go to the county clerk's office tomorrow. I'll have my assistant handle the fees.""

He handed me his black credit card, a gesture of trust that made my stomach flutter. For four years, I had devoted myself to him, tended to his home, soothed his moods, and slowly, painstakingly, I had watched his initial coldness melt into what I believed was real affection. I thought I had finally won.

The next day, I went to the county clerk's office, the original certificate tucked safely in my purse. The building was old and smelled of paper and dust. I waited in a short line, my hand resting on my still-flat stomach, dreaming of telling our child how wanted they were.

The clerk, a woman with tired eyes and a name tag that read 'Brenda', took my document. She typed my name, then Carter' s, into her computer. Her brow furrowed.

""Ma'am, I can't find a record of this.""

My smile faltered. ""Oh, there must be a mistake. We were married four years ago. Pickett and Leon.""

She typed again, slowly. ""I have no record of a marriage license issued to a Darline Pickett and a Carter Leon.""

A cold feeling started in my gut. ""That's impossible. We have the certificate right there.""

Brenda sighed, a sound of someone who had delivered bad news a thousand times. ""Sometimes people get those novelty certificates online. They look real, but they aren't legally filed.""

She looked at her screen again. ""I do have a record for Carter Leon, though.""

Hope surged through me. ""See? It must be under his name.""

Her eyes met mine, and they were filled with a pity that I didn't understand yet.

""He's legally married,"" she said, her voice soft. ""To an Erlene Fulton. The license was issued four and a half years ago. It's still active.""

Erlene Fulton.

The name hit me like a physical blow. My estranged stepsister. The woman who had been Carter's high school sweetheart. The woman who left him standing at the altar on their wedding day to chase an art career in Paris.

My mind went blank. The clerk's voice faded into a dull buzz. I remembered that day vividly. The panic in my father's eyes, my stepmother Clemma's frantic whispers about the family's reputation, about the Leon family's power and the insult Erlene had delivered.

And then, their eyes had turned to me.

""Darline, you have to do this,"" my father, Adler, had pleaded. ""Just for a little while. To save us from this humiliation. Carter has agreed. It's just a formality.""

I was the quiet, plain stepsister, always in Erlene's shadow. I had loved Carter from afar for years. In that moment of chaos, I saw a chance. A foolish, desperate chance to have the life I'd always dreamed of.

So I put on the dress. I walked down the aisle. I stood beside a cold, stone-faced Carter and became his wife. Or so I had thought.

For four years, I worked to make him forget Erlene. I learned his favorite foods, how he took his coffee, the way he liked his shirts ironed. I was there for him when his business deals went south, and I celebrated with him when they succeeded. Slowly, he began to soften. He started holding my hand in public. He bought me a car for our second anniversary. Last month, he'd given me his personal credit card.

""Buy yourself something nice, Darline,"" he had said, his voice a low murmur against my hair. ""You deserve it.""

I had believed him. I had believed in the life we were building, in the baby that was now growing inside me.

All of it was a lie.

I stumbled out of the clerk's office, the world tilting around me. A four-year marriage. A baby. And I was nothing more than a mistress, a placeholder in my own home.

That night, the phone rang. It was my stepmother, Clemma.

""Darline,"" she said, her voice tight with a strange mix of excitement and drama. ""Erlene is back. She's... she's very sick.""

A family meeting was called at my father's house. I sat on the plush sofa, feeling like an outsider. Erlene was there, looking pale and fragile in a cashmere throw, her hand resting delicately on Carter's arm. Carter sat beside her, his face a mask of concern.

""The doctors say it's terminal,"" Clemma announced, dabbing at her dry eyes with a tissue. ""She only has a few months left.""

""Her last wish,"" my father said, looking at me with pleading eyes, ""is to be with Carter. To die as his wife, officially.""

I stared at him, at all of them. ""What are you asking me to do?""

""Just... step aside for a little while,"" Clemma said smoothly. ""Let them have a ceremony. It's for a dying woman, Darline. A final comfort.""

""No,"" I said, my voice shaking. ""Absolutely not.""

""Darline!"" my father snapped. ""Don't be selfish!""

I stood up, my whole body trembling. ""Selfish? I have given four years of my life to this... this arrangement! I am carrying his child!""

The room went silent. Carter's head whipped around, his eyes wide. Erlene's fragile facade cracked for a second, a flicker of pure venom in her gaze before it was gone.

""A baby?"" Carter whispered.

Before I could say more, my father grabbed my arm. ""We'll discuss this later. You're overwrought.""

He and Clemma forced me into a guest room and locked the door. ""Think about what you're doing to this family!"" Clemma hissed through the wood.

A few hours later, Carter unlocked the door. His face was calm, reassuring. He took me in his arms.

""I'm sorry,"" he whispered. ""They shouldn't have pressured you. It's just... Erlene is dying. We have to grant her this last wish. It's all a charade, Darline. A performance to give her peace.""

He held my face in his hands. ""You and the baby are my future. This means nothing. It's just a ceremony. After she's gone, we'll go on as we have. I promise.""

I wanted to believe him. I was so desperate to believe him. The fake marriage certificate, Brenda's words at the clerk's office... I pushed it all down. He was here, holding me, promising me a future.

So I nodded, tears streaming down my face. ""Okay, Carter. For Erlene.""

The wedding was a grand affair, much grander than our quiet ceremony four years ago. Erlene, in a stunning white gown, looked more radiant than any dying woman I had ever seen. Carter stood by her side, the perfect, doting husband. I watched from the back, a ghost at the feast, my hand on my belly.

He kept his word, on the surface. He still came home to our bed at night. He would call me during the day. But his time was increasingly spent with Erlene, ""keeping her company"" in her final days.

""She needs me, Darline,"" he would say. ""It won't be for much longer.""

And I, like a fool, kept believing him.

Until tonight. He was late, supposedly at a board meeting. I was planning to make his favorite dinner, a small surprise. I stopped by his office to pick him up.

His secretary, a young woman named Chloe, looked flustered when she saw me.

""Mrs. Leon! I... Mr. Leon is in a very important meeting.""

""It's fine, Chloe, I'll just wait in his office.""

""No, you can't!"" she said, a little too quickly.

An alarm bell went off in my head. I pushed past her and walked toward his office door. I could hear voices inside. Erlene's and Carter's.

I pressed my ear to the cold wood.

""Carter, do you love her?"" Erlene's voice was sharp, not at all the weak tone of a dying woman.

""Don't be ridiculous, Erlene,"" Carter's voice was tired.

""Then why do you keep her around? Why the baby? Is it because you've forgotten what you wrote in your journal? The one you kept after I left?""

My blood ran cold.

""You said you'd do anything to get me back,"" Erlene pressed on. ""You said marrying my pathetic, love-sick stepsister was the perfect plan. That seeing her in my place would be the one thing that could wound my pride enough to make me come home.""

There was a crash from inside the office, like a fist hitting a desk.

""You were never supposed to read that,"" Carter snarled.

""But I did,"" Erlene purred. ""And it worked, didn't it? I'm back.""

A heavy silence fell. Then I heard Carter's voice, low and raw with a depth of emotion I had never, ever heard him use with me.

""I have always loved you, Erlene. It has only ever been you.""

My world shattered. Not just cracked, but obliterated into dust. The four years of my life, my devotion, my love... all a calculated move in his twisted game to win back my stepsister. I was a pawn. My baby was a pawn.

I backed away from the door, my hand over my mouth to stifle a sob. I couldn't breathe. The promises, the soft touches, the shared smiles-all fake. A performance.

I turned and ran, away from the office, away from the life that had been a lie. It was over. I had to leave. I had to save myself, and I had to save my child from this poison.",1,1753856345.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

Every day, I practice speaking English using the Acefluency app. One day, I had a voice call with a girl who had a great sense of humor. We talked for a while and had a really good conversation. Before ending the call, I said, “Let’s meet one day and have a coffee.”

She replied, “I want to tell you something.”

I asked, “What is it?”

She said, “I’m blind since birth.”

I was shocked. I didn’t know what to say. My heart skipped a beat, and I stayed silent for a moment. I had never spoken to someone with a disability before. Then she asked, “Will you still come to meet me?”

I said, “Yes, no problem. I want to see how you manage your daily life and how your mind guides you.” She smiled and said, “Let’s meet next Sunday.” I said, “Okay, we’ll meet near the post office.”

The day arrived—yesterday. She messaged me, “Are you coming?” I replied, “If I finish all my office work, I’ll let you know before 6 p.m.”

At 5:30 p.m., I finished my work and told myself I’d reach by 6. But something strange happened. Suddenly, I felt very tired and sick. I couldn’t walk properly. I felt weak, anxious, and my body was pushing me back, like something was stopping me.

Still, I forced myself to go. I reached the metro station. She called and said, “I’m at Gate No. 6.” I looked around and saw a blind girl standing near a man who was yelling on the phone. That was her.

I paused. My mind said, Run! People around were staring at her with pity. She didn’t look attractive, and I felt nervous. I turned on airplane mode on my phone and started walking away.

But then I stopped. You gave her your word, I reminded myself. She was waiting, looking around with a sad face. I told myself, It doesn’t matter what people think.

I went back and said, “Ma’am, can I help you?” She replied, “Someone is coming.” I walked up to her and said hello. She smiled and shook my hand. I was nervous, but I stayed calm.

To my surprise, the meeting went well. We talked in English, had tea, and had a nice conversation. Before leaving, I helped her get into a rickshaw and paid the driver. She looked very happy.

She asked me a final question:
“How did you feel after meeting me?”

It was a deep question. I paused and said, “I feel good.”

This moment was big for me. It made me think deeply about life and about how we see people who are different. I don’t know what others will think of this story, but I wanted to share it honestly.

Thank you for reading till the end. Your time means a lot to me.

Here's what was happening with Cody and Christine. Ted quickly gave Cody a yellow steak that looked like a yellow Starburst and ran into the kitchen and locked it. Christine didn't know what to do and wanted to wipe out the hair taste in her throat so she just sipped the straw for her home made vanilla milkshake. Cody finally had enough and ran towards the kitchen doors, slammed his whole side against them, breaking them open. Reveling a messy steamy kitchen with robotic hands with gloves making all the food with random loud buzzer going off in random directions along side a wall with irons doors all closed except one where he saw a thrid green waiter(Ed) who had a round bubbly personality.  He was popping a huge pimple on this hairless moose/cow and pouring the pus into a glass cup. The same kind that Christine had for her milkshake which was indeed homemade. ""Oh hey sir-"" ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS THING?!"" Cody ran back out faster than before and ran to the table seeing all three of us pale like ghosts. ""Guys we need to leave this place right now!"" Zach said taking in charge but there was a problem. The doors are gone. Didn't take us long to slam a stoll against the glass walls but the glass just bounced it back off. ""how the hell are we going get out of here!"" I cried out. Christine had the idea where we wacth to see if one of the customers get up and leave. All we could do was wacth all the other customers eat and see if they might get up and know of a exit. It felt like our only hope. I saw people dig their fat hands into pink meaty pudding that was scooped and placed on a table. People eating dead rotten dogs, brown blood spilled out onto the table than their shoes and floor. Buckets of mashed up crickets and mash potatoes with mustard. Raw deep sea black eels thrashing around a fat grubby kids palm before going limp as his head and skull gets crushed by being it chewed on like a gummy toothless baby. Pineapple pizza. It took us around a hour to give up before we saw anything else we didn't want to. Even after all that and I still wanted a refill for my soda so I got some more before getting greeted by Fred. ""Why are you drinking a diet Pepsi? Is it because your a lazy fat fuck who cant even see his feet when he looks down?""  ""What-"" i replied nervously. ""Here drink this, it'll make all that fat come off."" he said kindly before handed me a glass jar filled with a gray see-through liquid that looked like old dish washing water. ""Drink it or ill bash you face in."" He said with a deep voice. I was so threatened by this that I even pissed myself a little. ""O-ok"" I quickly mumbled before taking swig. It tasted as if someone put broccoli, chocolate and beef jerky and sat it in a barrel of whiskey in the sun for weeks. But after he made me take i second sip it changed flavor. The only way I could describe it as if heaven was put in a old jar that looked like it used to hold some type of jam before they ripped off the sicker label and handed it to me. That's exactly what it was. I was instantly hooked and kept drinking for what felt like 4 hours was actually 10 seconds and I swallowed it all. ""Good boy. Now you'll be pretty like thee other boys... nice and slim, just enough to hold and move around just with one hand on their side"" He whispered in a husky voice. His yellow teeth grind against each slowly as he looks at me. I immediately felt sick to my core and wanted to back away from this creep before Cody stepped in ""Hey dude what fuck did you just give him?"" He immediately started tackling Cody down on the tile floor and placed his hands around his head. I know Cody isn't really the strongest but i could tell that he could of easily push Fred off but he stayed perfectly in place on top of him. ""Oh, your eyes darling... they look so innocent... but your face is horrific along with you audited. You'll have much training to go through."" He slowly placed his pasty white thumbs over his eyes. ""GET THE FUCK OFF ME!"" Cody screamed at the top of his lungs, enough to get zach's and Christine's attention. ""Shh, hush now baby... Daddy's here. Its only going hurt a little."" He slowly started pushing his thumbs against his eyes. ""Dont struggle, it's only gonna hurt you for a lil while."" He looked down at him with a blank expression. The only emotion I saw was in his pale blue and yellow eyes filled with evil intentions and a hint of joy ""CODY NOOO!"" Christine screamed and instantly started trying calling for 911 but the phone kept hanging up. Cody began kicking and screaming. ""AHH FUCK, SOMEBODY HELP ME!"" He begged, the desperation in his voice ever so clear. Fred whistled and yelled commandingly. ""CUSTOMER NUMBER 452 KEEP HIS LEGS DOWN!"" soon enough a fat obese woman eating some type of bug that kinda resembled a pale puppy instantly jumps off her seat and lands directly on Cody's knees, leaving behind a loud crunch muffled by her thighs. Breaking his legs. Cody screams in the most painful voice ever. Small spurts of blood come out from around Fred's thumbs. Pressing deeper into his eye sockets. Zachary bum rushes him and he doesn't even flinch, only making another whistle. ""Waiter 746 and customer 82 hold him back!"" a fat man larger than the lady who snapped Cody's legs which has now pulled out what appears to be a shark fin in a 2 inch coating of red hard candy from her 2nd fat roll and started eating it. The larger mans gut stuck out so much that his vains where popping out of his brownish gray skin. His Paul blurt mustache covered in garlic sauce and syrup from the bowl of well, syrup and garlic suace along side bread sticks. He growls at Zach before he speed walks towards Zach and trys attacking him, buying Fred more time by holding Zachary off. Me and Christine both screamed in horror. We didn't know what to do. We couldn't do anything. Cody finally let's out a loud, agonizing cry as more blood spurts out and coats Fred's thumbs. He's done what he wanted to do and we couldn't even stop him. He springs up like a cartoon character and pulls Cody up from under the massive woman and tosses him easily against his shoulder. I could hear Cody start to cry for probably the first time I ever and will ever hear. He walked to the kitchen humming a small tune, swaying his hips slightly with each step. ""Daddy's gonna take good care of you now. You got nothing to worry about gorgeous."" Cody quietly pleas for out help before fred opens the door before  Ed comes out and runs towards Zach getting ready to punch before Fred spoke. ""Your late number 746."" He said before the doors closed behind him. Ed immediately stops rushing to zach before looking around. ""Ewww look at that fat guy, hes so ugly and gross. Well i guess the job here is done anyway. So, clientele 82 if you may."" The large man stops what hes doing and lays down on his table, spilling his bowl and reaches behind and under his ass to pull out a bread stick that he laid on to and chewing on it while looking at the bright ceiling light. ""Ahm, sir. Would you like anything to order, i noticed that you only ordered a coffee. Are you hungry?"" ""Fuck no, im not eating your poison."" He says between pants, keeping that fat pig off of him took a lot of energy out of him. ""Thats odd... most people order something... i think your supposed to order."" ""LISTEN IM NOT EATING ANYTHING YOU MAKE!"" ""...i was just trying help sir."" ""YOU CAN HELP BY GETTING US THE HELL OUT OF HERE!"" ""sir. the door?"" ""THERE ISNT ANY!!"" ""Sir take this."" he said while pulling out a some type of small, raw, pink, meaty like substance and shoving in zachs mouth before quickly shaking his hand in the air to get his spit off of him. ""Sir your standing right behind it. I recommend you dont take anymore drugs before coming back here. Have a great day."" Ed said in exhausting tone. Zach quickly turns around excepting him to be lying but he froze. Toke a step. Held out his hand and did a motion with it like he just opened a door. And ran through the glass walls and was out side. I couldn't believe it. I ran as fast as I could and tried the same but i didn't go through. ""ZACH PLEASE SEND HELP!"" I yelled but he was already down the road running for his life. Hopefully he'll come back. Call the cops or something which Christine had already tried. I hoped maybe now that he was outside he could call for help and have this place swarmed with cops. Another hour later, and only Ted came back. ""Huck, huck, huck! Howdy people's, may i take your orders?"" ""No. No thank you, please"" I replied. ""I... no im fine."" ""Are you sure Christine."" He said in a deep serious voice. ""Say no again and... aww shucks I forgot what insult to say"" he said before quickly acting to his usual goofy voice. He stood there for around 12 seconds like he got hit with a freeze ray before walking off. By now the restaurant was empty and the only noise left was the faint music blasting into the cashiers headphones while he cleans the tables and the sqeaking of teds clown shoes walking away. Outside the windows was complete darkness. Before we knew it me and Christine fell asleep in separate booths. Im surprised I wasn't scared enough to stay up all night after that. When I woke up it was bright as day. The restaurant was nicely lit with the sunlight and all I could see from the windows was a empty dessert. I heard a bell ring from being opened by a door and saw Zach had just come back through the same wall he left through. ""Hey zach!"" I yelled to him. He kept walking all the way to the cashier in the back and said. ""Good day Jefferson, I think ill try out the number seven today. Im dying to try whatever you serve.""

1mcz0kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/1mcz0kz/how_to_lock_whatsapp_on_macbook/,How to Lock WhatsApp on MacBook?,"Last week I was working from a café-turned-co-working space in Amsterdam. Nothing unusual; laptops everywhere, people in meetings, zoned into screens.

Then something happened that really stuck with me.

A guy next to me takes a call. Gets up, walks away from his desk. Leaves his MacBook wide open. Screen on, no password lock.

His friends were still at the table.

As soon as he walked away, they opened WhatsApp on his laptop. Started reading his chats. Out loud. Laughing. Then opened his browser and kept going.

Everyone around heard parts of his conversations.

I just sat there thinking, this guy has no clue his personal life is getting casually aired out to a bunch of strangers. And honestly?

That could’ve been me.

Because I’ve done that. Left my laptop open, thinking, “I’ll be back in a sec.”

Coffee breaks, meeting rooms, even at home.

But seeing it happen to someone else? Made it very real.

**Safety Precautions I Now Follow (Every Day)**

WhatsApp holds personal stuff. Private chats. Work messages. Group info. It doesn’t belong out in the open.

I lock WhatsApp on my MacBook in two ways:

**First, I lock the WhatsApp app itself**

I use a small Mac tool called **AppCrypt**. I picked a few apps I want to protect. WhatsApp was one of the first.

When I open it, it asks for a password. If someone else tries and gets it wrong, it quietly takes a webcam photo and logs the time. No alerts. Just a record.

Even if I forget to lock my screen, WhatsApp stays blocked.

**Second, I block access to WhatsApp Web in browsers**

I use the same tool to block the web version. I added web WhatsApp to the block list. Now if someone tries to go there, it just won’t load.

I can also set it up so it only blocks during work hours or when I step away. The schedule is locked behind the same password.

Here’s how AppCrypt helps:

|Feature|What it does|
|:-|:-|
|Lock the WhatsApp app|No one can open it without my password|
|Block WhatsApp Web|Stops it from opening in any browser|
|Photo on failed access|I get a quiet log of who tried to open it|
|Auto lock after idle time|Covers me when I forget to lock the screen|
|Add websites by URL or keyword|Makes blocking simple and fast|
|Apply custom schedules|I can block WhatsApp only at certain times if needed|

It’s not a big app. It just does what I need. Doesn’t slow my Mac or pop up all the time.

**I’m More Careful Now**

I don’t leave screens open. I check who’s around. I close WhatsApp when I don’t need it. If I walk away, I lock the screen or shut the lid.

Most people don’t think twice about it. But one unlocked screen is all it takes for someone to see too much.

That café moment was enough. I don’t want WhatsApp chats being read out loud by someone else.

We didn’t really talk on the way back. Just watched the road and trees crawl on and on. It was a long way back into town. The others made us slow, Mark limped, his leg hastily bandaged up, and Adi trudged hunched over, beneath his ragged shirt deep gashes pulled at his back and shoulders. I got off the lightest with only a line of bruises across my torso. But even so, I wanted more than anything to fall into bed and sleep for a long time.

It was Sunday morning and town was quiet. Adi turned off first down his street and soon after I farewelled Mark and headed west towards home. The lines of oaks moved in the wind. Leaves fell, still green with summer, across the immense tarmac and wide immaculate lawns. Most cars still sat in their driveways, it was far too early and far too cold to get out of bed. A brave few were out, empty lots outside empty homes.

Our house stood small and sickly blue and white. I fumbled for my key. I’d meant to be back in time for church, but we were delayed. There were, of course, going to be the questions and scowls and tellings-off, but I wasn’t worried. This time was no different. We had been through the big song and dance before. I’d find myself at evening service instead and perhaps confession and it’d be never spoken of again.

I dragged myself upstairs into the shower and scoured my wounds. The water was gloriously warm with no one else to compete with. I let my bruises soak and melt away, let myself breathe the humid air and push out a sigh. Felt the heat once again fill me. The water fell on my face. It was a long time before it ran cold, and my thoughts went back along our return walk, out into the forest. Out to where we had hiked, a hut in the pines, a fire, dinner, drinks. As I stepped out of the shower I stumbled, grabbing, grasping at the glass, feet sliding on wet tile. I fell short of the cabinet, hard onto the floor. My skull only an inch from cracking itself open on the vanity. But my chest and knees were not so spared, the bruises I had just washed away were again sprouting, black and aching across my body. 

I hobbled to the bedroom and found something in the wardrobe. But as I turned to the mirror the room seemed different than as I’d left it yesterday. I checked the false drawer in the bedside dresser was still locked and the hole beneath the bed still concealed. Someone had certainly tidied up. But it wasn’t just that. It felt like I’d been away a lot longer. The smell was different. Like all the air had been replaced. Something. I looked at the bed and it took every effort to not fall face first into sleep. The blankets were pulled tight, not a crease was visible, like it had never been slept in. I shook the feeling away. I left the room behind and went down painfully for food.

Sunday was grocery day so there was very little for breakfast. I found only a single grapefruit and the last couple slices of bread, sad and stale. At the table I sprinkled sugar and scraped butter. The kettle boiled and I poured the coffee pot. Maybe I ought to go to bed to avoid the confrontation, I could hop in now and be asleep before they return. Either way I need to clean up before they are back or that’ll be another thing Mum can complain about, her immaculate counter dirtied with dust, and I probably scratched the plate too. I finished the toast and started on the fruit and was no more than a few bites in when they arrived. The car didn’t make much sound, coming in smooth and silent. The doors slammed and their voices, hushed and muffled, came slowly to the front door. Their key seemed to struggle, the lock sticking even more than it always had, and the bottom of the door caught on the sill. It took a solid kick to dislodge it, and the three of them tumbled inwards. Dad in his suit, Mum her coat and heels, and Warren in the trousers that collected on his shoes. Mum was the first one to see me. I swallowed.

“Hi…,” she said, “are you here with Giles?”

I looked up nonchalantly from my food to the three of them standing surprised in the entrance hall. You could tell the service had run long, they had the impatient scowls that form when the priest tries to go on about in the homily, those knotted edges of your cheeks that take the rest of the day to unfurl.

“Hi guys,” I said, “I just got home—”

“—Sorry, is Giles here too?” Mum said.

“Ah… what?”

“Who are you? Where is Giles?”

“What? What are you doing Mum?”

She turned to Dad. “Darling…” She put her hand on his arm.

“What—what is this?” I continued, getting annoyed, “I get it, I’m sorry. I meant to get back earlier but Mark got hurt walking back and we had to carry him and it slowed us down and my phone was dead. It’s okay, I’ll go later—”

“—Son, tell us who you are.”

“What? What do you mean?” I raised my palms in a shrug.

“Giles!” Dad shouted down the hall. “Giles!” He moved further down the hall, and started up the stairs, shouting all the way. Mum looked at me.

“Is he here?” she asked, her face was confused and angry.

“Who?” I asked, my own anger now filling out my voice.

“Giles. My son.”

“I’m right here.” I raised my arms out fully. “Mum what are you—”

“—He’s not here!” Dad shouted from above.

“Then who the hell are you?” Mum shouted, “How’d you get in here?”

“With my key, obviously.” I held it up sarcastically. “Can you all please stop this.”

Dad was in the room now, he loomed towards me. He was not an angry man. He had the same fire and same heart as anyone does, but he didn’t exercise it. So when he did get mad he let it out in a great burst, as someone who hasn’t run in years does when faced with a mile. He would start blearing out of the gate, and end it limping and wheezing. But for that short sprint he could run as well as anyone, and now as he strode towards me, I prepared for it.

“Son, who the fuck do you think you are breaking in here, eating our food,” he was coming ever closer, “How’d you get in here, huh? Where’d you steal the key—”

“—Dad.” 

He grabbed me by my jacket, pulling me out of the seat. He was small, but I was smaller. He pushed me against the bench. Mum and Warren came closer as Dad pinned me. I looked from him, to Mum, whose eyes were watery and far away. She never liked fighting. She’d get him to do the talking whilst she slunk off to some room to cover her ears. Fighting in our house was a calm and orderly matter, done with utmost efficiency. But this time it was bad. Dad leaned close. “Where the hell is Giles?! What’d you do…where the fuck is my son?!”

“Dad, it’s me. I’m Giles, I’m right here!”

His eyes went wide at that and he pushed me away. I stood alone in the middle of the room, encircled by them. 

“Guys what the hell is going on!?” Tears were starting.

“He thinks he’s our son,” Mum said.

“I heard. Stay right there boy. Honey, call the police.”

“Dad, what are you doing, what happened?” I reached to grab the phone from Mum. As I moved he came lunging for me. I darted back. He kept coming.

“Dad stop—”

“—I said don’t move. Stay there. We will sort this out. You’re obviously confused and not yourself—”

I don’t know what that stirred in me, perhaps it was the three of them around me, or Dad’s deflating hands now trying to comfort me like trapped livestock, or the half-finished breakfast still on the bench behind him, but I felt I had to run. Right then was the only chance of escape, the small gap between Warren and Mum was where I had to go. I turned, and before the first number could be dialled I was out the door and out the gate and into the wide street. I ran and ran and ran. Leaves kept falling around me, my feet thundered along the pavement and all I could think was how Warren hadn’t even looked at me.",1,1753855737.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

1mcyvsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1mcyvsc/bad_mouse/,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read “I have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse”. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.



They all had titles hastily scribbled on, “Bad Mouse: Episode 1”, “Bad Mouse: Episode 2”, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading “This is the last”. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be “Bad Mouse”, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.



All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.



Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the “show”, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone’s pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.



That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading “From me to you, Bad Mouse”, the “I have something I love” being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.



The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.



“Bad Mouse is getting desperate!” a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.



Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words “Bad Mouse” arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse’s depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.



Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments…just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words “Getting desperate”, but only in syllables:



”Get…ting…des…per…ate”.



The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.



No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over…and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network’s channels were all hijacked.



By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.



The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.



Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.



""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.



The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.



Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.



Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children’s channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.



Others had…darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today’s world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.



Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.



By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.



How very wrong those people were.



For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived…



There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.



Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:



“i’m here”’



“is it getting desperate?”



“i hate you all”



“i have to get attention”



“i’m desperate!”



“you love me, but I don’t love you”



“bad mouse is getting desperate!”



“i’m going to show you the world”



“bad mouse is getting worse!”



“me me me me me me”



“attention”



Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be “death day”. Everyone’s blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.



Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone’s horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.



Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.



By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children’s networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel’s executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.



On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children’s shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.



In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.”



The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.



A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.



All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.



The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.



As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on “a little something” to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.



But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.



No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.

1mcyv2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/1mcyv2p/analysis_of_the_enemy_mv_narrative/,"Analysis of the ""Enemy"" MV narrative","So, I hope it's ok to make this its own topic, due to the MV thread being mostly just about how great the song is in general, but I have some theories I wanted to bounce around, and hear what other people have come up with on their own. 
So to start, I think TWICE is playing one person, and also the ""enemy within"". There's a lot of scenes that connect each member to each other, like the apples, the receipt, the coffee cup, the bridge, the room. The shots are made to look like the person is overlapping the other, often in the same pose. To me, this is visually trying to say ""this is the same person."" My biggest tell they are playing one individual is when Chaeyoung wraps her hand in the bandage, every scene with the members after have them wearing the same bandage. So, I don't think they are playing themselves individually going through turmoil, but more playing one individual who is battling an ""enemy within."" 

To confuse things further, I think sometimes they play as that ""enemy within"" too. Basically, whenever one of them interacts with the main individual, that's the enemy, ie, anxiety, telling them they aren't good enough, etc. 

Now, I think the intro and outro are the links between it all. We obviously heard the rumors that TWICE re-signed their contacts recently but nothing confirmed, and this message is sort of connected to that. 

I think even though we're seeing one individual, I think that individual represents the group as a whole, unified entity. The fact she's traveling with a guitar, and I might be wrong, but I am pretty sure there are 9 apples in the bag, sort of representing OT9. So I think the character is TWICE itself, and that's why we see them all play different parts of the character. Each of them have their own internal struggles, but for the narrative of the MV, it's one character. 

In the beginning, the main character, who I'll just refer to as TWICE form now on, is going on a journey, and decides at that moment, that maybe now is a good time to rest (not re-signing or taking a break.) She places the bag of apples down, and the apples all fall out of the bag, scattering. I believe this represents the idea that, if TWICE rests, stops, or takes a break, the 9 of them might drift apart. 

We then see shots of TWICE going through their turmoil with the ""enemy."" Over time, they overcome these insecurities, and I think the unity in their dancing sort of represents them helping each other overcome their own internal struggles. 

So then, we come to the outro. TWICE is on a journey again. Same imagery, same bag of apples and guitar. She hesitates for a moment, but because she's overcome her ""enemy"", she's stronger now. So instead of stopping to rest, she continues on her journey, with confidence. 

I feel the message they are trying to say is: ""ONCE, we're still going. It's been hard and we often hide our struggles, but we got each other's backs. Don't worry. We're stronger than ever, together.""",1,1753855511.0,twice,0,1.0,False

* **Moneyline**: Atlanta Dream (-157) vs. Dallas Wings (+250). Implied probabilities? Atlanta’s at 60.7% (1.57 decimal odds), Dallas at 28.6% (3.5 decimal). *Translation*: Bookmakers think Dallas is about as likely to win as a vegan at a barbecue.
* **Spread**: Atlanta -4.5 (-110) / Dallas +4.5 (-110). The line reflects Atlanta’s home-court edge (8-3 SU this season) and Dallas’ shaky road record.
* **Total**: 165.5 (Evens). With both teams averaging \~78 PPG, this line’s as tight as a rookie’s triple-threat.

**Player Prop Bets to Watch**

1. **Allisha Gray (Atlanta) – Points Over/Under 18.5 (-105/-125)**  
Gray’s averaging 18.7 PPG since stepping up with Rhyne Howard out. The Over (-105) is a slight favorite, but her 18.5/18.7 split makes this a coin flip. *Bet*: Over if she’s had coffee; Under if she’s still in pajamas.
2. \*\*Brittney Griner (Dallas) – Rebounds Over/Under 5.5 (-12

**The ""Cinderella"" Mercury vs. the ""Giant-Killing"" Fever — Who Wears the Slippers?**

The Phoenix Mercury (-4.5, -156) roll into Indianapolis like a well-oiled espresso machine, while the Indiana Fever (+4.5, +250) sip their coffee with the calm of a team that’s already beaten the odds. Let’s break this down with the statistical precision of a spreadsheet-obsessed fanboy.

### Key Stats & Odds

* **Spread**: Phoenix is favored by 4.5 points, but don’t let that fool you—this is a game where the Fever’s 104-point season surplus vs. Phoenix’s 82-point edge feels like a WWE match: *everyone’s* got a chip on their shoulder.
* **Total**: 164.5 points (Over/Under: -110). With the Mercury allowing 79.8 PPG (top-5 defense) and the Fever averaging 84.4 PPG (middle-of-the-pack), expect a defensive tug-of-war that’ll have fans checking their watches more than their popcorn bags.

### Player Props to Watch

1. **Kelsey Mitchell (Fever)**: The third-leading scorer (20.2 PPG) is priced at **-105** for Over 19.5 points. If she drops 20, it’s a “Kelsey’s Back!” party in Indianapolis. Under? Well, under 20 against Satou Sabally? *Unthinkable.*

## Key Features analysis

the diverse landscape of 3D mugs means that numerous features differentiate top-quality products from inferior alternatives. A careful assessment of these key aspects is essential for making an informed purchasing decision.

**Material and Construction:** The choice of material significantly impacts the durability, heat retention, and overall aesthetic of the 3D mug. High-quality ceramic,such as new bone china or stoneware,are prized for their strength,resistance to chipping,and ability to retain heat. These materials typically allow for finely sculpted details and vibrant color glazes. The quality of the construction, including the uniformity of the sculpting, smoothness of the glaze, and absence of imperfections, directly affects the mug's longevity and visual appeal.

**Design Complexity and Detail:** 3D mugs are distinguished by their intricate designs, which can range from simple character embellishments to elaborate sculptural creations. The level of detail achieved in the sculpting and painting contributes significantly to the mug's realism and artistry. Mugs with well-defined facial features, realistic textures, and carefully applied paint accents tend to be more visually compelling and collectable. The complexity of the design also indicates the level of craftsmanship involved in its creation.

**Theme and Character Representation:** The thematic appeal is a central aspect of a 3D mug, as it dictates its overall aesthetic and target audience. Whether featuring beloved characters from movies, books, or video games, or showcasing majestic animals, nature-inspired motifs, or abstract art, the mug's theme should resonate with the user's interests and preferences. The accurate and evocative representation of the chosen theme is crucial for creating a fulfilling and engaging drinking experience.**Ergonomics and Practicality:** While visual appeal is paramount, the ergonomic design and practicality of a 3D mug are equally vital. The handle should offer a pleasant and secure grip, allowing for easy handling even when the mug is filled with hot liquid. The mug's weight and size should be proportional to its capacity, ensuring it is manageable and stable on various surfaces. Consideration should also be given to the ease of cleaning, with dishwasher-safe options offering added convenience.

**Glaze and Finish:** The glaze and finish of a 3D mug play a critical role in its overall aesthetic and durability. High-quality glazes are typically non-toxic, lead-free, and resistant to staining and fading. They should provide a smooth, even surface that enhances the mug's colors and protects the underlying material. The finish can range from glossy to matte,depending on the desired visual effect,and should be consistent throughout the mug's surface.

Key features of the 3D mugs include:

* High-quality Construction Material
* Detailed Design
* Ergonomic Design
* Lead-Free Glaze
* Suitable capacity
* High Heat Resistance

Short answer: YES.  
Long answer: YES, but you have to pay with your time, energy, and creativity.

Here’s a no-BS breakdown of how to start affiliate marketing with no money:

1. Pick a niche you’re not clueless about

Pick a niche you *can* talk about endlessly: fitness, skincare, gaming, fashion, weird mushroom coffee, whatever. Your content will be your currency, so start with what you *won’t* get bored of.

2. Join free affiliate programs

You don’t need to pay to join affiliate programs. Start with:

* Amazon Associates (low commission but tons of products)
* Temu Affiliate program
* Impact (good for lifestyle & tech)
* Sephora/Alo/Target have affiliate programs too
* TikTok Creative Affiliate Program

Just Google “\[Brand\] affiliate program.” You’ll be surprised how many exist.

3. Create free content on free platforms

No blog? No problem.

Use:

* TikTok
* Instagram Reels
* Pinterest
* YouTube Shorts
* Reddit (yep, even here)
* Threads

Focus on creating value-based content: product demos, reviews, “Top 3 must-haves,” etc. Don’t make it feel like an ad. Make it feel like a life hack.

4. Use a free link-in-bio tool

Tools like ViralMango (we have a free forever plan) help you organize your affiliate links in one place. You can even make a landing page with our builder using images, videos, and texts.

5. Be shameless (but not spammy)

You don’t need to go viral. You need to be consistent\*.\* Post 1 piece of content a day. Talk about your favorite product and why you use it. Mention your link naturally.

# Bonus Tips:

* Use ChatGPT to help write content or captions

*Hi. The following is a fictional story written in the style of a war memoir. It’s heavy—graphic violence, PTSD themes—and it has a subtle supernatural element near the end. Would appreciate some feedback on pacing and tone.*

*Thanks.* 

\*\*\*

This happened back in 2009, but I never talked about it until now. Not with my VA group, not even with my ex- wife. I buried it deep, same as the Army buried the report. But lately I’ve been waking up in cold sweats again—always smelling the same thing. Burnt skin. I think it’s time I put it down somewhere, just once. 

Name’s John Byrne, by the way. Born in Dorchester, raised with a chip on my shoulder and a Red Sox cap I wore into the Hindu Kush. But that was a long time ago.

I was a radio guy with 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry—4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th ID—stationed out of FOB Blessing, Kunar Province, Afghanistan.

That place was a bitch. Nothing but jagged mountains, washed-out goat trails barely wide enough for a Humvee.

Our AO ran deep into the valleys, where trucks couldn’t go and even MRAPs had to stop. We humped it mostly on foot, full gear, sweating under that dry-ass Afghan sun. You ever try climbing shale in 100-degree heat with 60 pounds on your back and no air? 

That was the job. Nights dropped cold enough to see your breath, but the days—man, the days were just dust, heat, and wondering if today was the day you get your ass blown off. 

\*\*\*

I was an RTO—radio telephone operator—for 2nd Platoon, Bravo Company. I carried the radio, logged comms, and kept my mouth shut. I had just enough rank to carry responsibility but not enough to question orders. 

That radio was my lifeline and my leash. But there’s one patrol I can’t stop replaying. Not because of bullets or mortars—but because of what I saw. And what I didn’t stop. 

We called it Village 41. That’s what was scrawled on the laminated map duct-taped inside the Humvee. Half these places didn’t have real names—or if they did, no one outside the AO could pronounce them. Village 41 sat high near the Pakistan border, in a narrow valley choked with dust and dry brush.

 Intel said it was a HIG waypoint. That’s Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin. One of the smaller shitbag factions fighting us and the Afghan government. Not as flashy as the Taliban, but they had a few kills to their name. S-2 said fighters used the route to stash weapons, slip across the border, maybe rack out for a night. Probably just a grid someone circled in the TOC. 

\*\*\*

We stepped off late afternoon. That was June 11th. Sun was dropping but the heat was still brutal. Everything smelled like cordite, and hot nylon. No MRAP could make that incline. So we humped it. Just us, and rock. My calves were screaming. Plate carrier dug into my collarbone. 

Every step kicked up grit. We passed the remains of a Russian fighting position—a pile of rusted shell casings and a half-buried metal box with Cyrillic on the side. Nobody said anything, but everyone glanced at it. Like a grave marker.

No one talked. Just the usual noise—gear clinking, boots scraping rocks, someone clearing their throat. 

My radio beeped through the headset, heartbeat steady. LT. Sommers was up front. Staff Sergeant Hudson paced like a caged dog. 

\*\*\*

Then— CRACK. High, sharp—7.62 by the sound of it. AK. Contact, right side. “Contact! 3 o’clock!” someone yelled. 

The squad scattered like dropped gear. Hudson was already barking: “Return fire! Push right, now!” 

Rounds started kicking up dirt and rock. RPK, maybe an old PKM—distinct thump-thump-thump echoing off the ridge. 

SPC Chang went down. Took one to the neck. He dropped like a sack. Tried to gurgle something, but it was just blood. Red froth bubbling in the dust. Doc was on him fast, but it didn’t matter. We all saw it.  

Chang was twenty-two. Born in Flushing, Queens. He had this dumb Yankees hat he pinned up in his bunk — just to fuck with me, but he didn’t care.

I still remember the last thing he said to me. “You think they got mango Rip-Its at the COP? I’ll bet you ten bucks they do.”

Then he laughed. That was five minutes before his throat opened up like wet paper.

\*\*\*

 I hit the dirt, keyed the mic\*. “Blackjack Actual, this is Two-One Romeo—Troops in contact, grid to follow. Break. One KIA, requesting immediate support, over.”\* 

Then a crackle. *“Two-One Romeo, this is Blackjack Actual. Send grid. What is your SITREP? Over.”* 

Hudson was already beside me, ripping the mic from my hand. “

*“Break break—Blackjack Actual, this is One-Six. Grid Sierra Foxtrot one-five-eight-two seven-four-six-niner. Say again—one-five-eight-two seven-four-six-niner.* 

*Multiple rounds from elevated position, treeline to our east. I got a man down, KIA. Break. Sweeping to engage and secure nearby compounds. Over.”* 

\*\*\*

The net was quiet a moment, then came the reply:

 *“Solid copy, One-Six. ISR unavailable. Nearest QRF element two klicks south—ETA thirty mikes. Acknowledge.”* 

*“Roger that. We’ll handle it. Out.”*

Hudson dropped the mic gritting his teeth. Eyes scanning the ridge. 

*“Two and Three, push east! I want suppressing fire on that treeline—right fucking now!""*

 Rounds cracked overhead. I heard the pop-pop-pop of M4s and the ripping BRRRRT of Santiago’s SAW opening up.

 *“Red, peel right! Flank ‘em! White team hold base of fire! Get that 203 up—put a round behind those rocks!”* 

Harlow knelt beside me, thumbing his M203, launching a thunk I can still hear right now. Seconds later, a whump and dust kicked up where the grenade landed. Hudson was barking again: 

*“Peel and fire! Bound by buddy team! Move with fucking purpose!”*

\*\*\*

 PFC Knox and Franks pushed forward in a low crouch, firing short bursts—tap-tap, tap-tap—as the rest of us laid down suppressive. 

They ducked behind a broken wall. 

Next pair moved. “Shift fire five meters right! They’re moving—eyes on muzzle flash behind that shale outcrop!” 

*“Saw gunner, adjust fire! Talk your rounds in! You’re going high! Lower two mils!”*  

Santiago grunted, shifted his barrel. The SAW hammered again—long bursts. Brass poured out.

 *“RTO, you trackin’ this? Log all contacts. Mark grid. And tell command we’re bounding through the compound—clearing as we go!”*

 I was already jotting the time—1938 local—my fingers shaking as I flipped through the SINCGARS net. 

\*\*\*

After five, maybe ten-minutes it was quiet again. Ears ringing. Smell of cordite and copper in the air. 

Classic Afghan ghost contact—hit, run, disappear. Smoke and shadows. Never even saw the shooters. Maybe three guys max, just harassing fire. 

Hudson was pacing. Breathing hard. He stared at Chang’s body for a long time. But he said nothing.

 Staff Sergeant Mark Hudson led 1st Squad. He was thirty-five, from Torrance, California. He’d done two tours in Iraq before this one —Fallujah and Mosul—where things got ugly fast.

Guys said he once called in fire on his own position just to break contact, but nobody knew if it was true. He didn’t believe in hesitation. His motto was: ""Get in. Sweep. Secure. Get the fuck out."" ROEs were flexible. Hudson wrote the fine print. 

\*\*\*

We hit the ridge as the sun was starting to dip. The village lay below, dead quiet. Mud walls, tin roofs, a few terraces hacked into the hillside. Not a soul in sight. Just the sound of a dog barking. We stacked on the largest compound—low stone walls, cracked gate. 

We entered the compound per SOP. Hudson had us stack along the outer wall—two up front with him, me and the terp hanging back. No shots fired. No resistance. He didn’t bother with a knock—just kicked the gate in.

\*\*\*

 First structure was a two-room clay-brick shack. Inside, five civilians—three kids, two adult women. No men. We cleared the rooms, rifles up, by the book. Canted muzzle through the doorway, pie the corners, sweep left to right. No weapons. No comms gear. No signs of HIG. 

Hudson  barked, “Set security. Search the inside.” Specialist Rowan was posted at the door. Cantu and Harlow started flipping mats, checking jugs for false bottoms. I followed the terp over to the women. 

Per ROE, only our terp could ask questions directly—unless the detainees were armed or hostile. But Hudson didn’t give a shit about that. He grabbed one of the women by the wrist. She looked barely 20. Screamed something in Pashto. 

The terp stepped forward, trying to defuse. “She says her husband’s gone to the fields with the goats. Not a fighter. Just family.” “Yeah?” Hudson said. “Then she won’t mind if we check the house.” He shoved her aside and stepped into the next room. 

\*\*\*

There was a makeshift cradle in the corner. It was empty. No sign of any weapons cache, we didn’t find any—no ammo tins, no radio batteries. Just a plastic tea set and a prayer rug.

Then Hudson did something that stopped me cold. He took out a small photo taped to the wall—just a picture of some bearded man holding a baby—and burned it with his lighter. Right there in front of the family. The kids started crying. The woman just sat down hard and covered her head with her scarf. 

Hudson turned to the terp. “Ask her where they’re hiding the shit. NOW!”

“She says there’s nothing, Sergeant.” 

Hudson  leaned down, close enough to whisper. “Tell her if she lies again, I’ll shoot the fucking goat first, then the oldest boy.”

 “Sergeant—” the terp protested but Hudson cut him off. “Translate it!” The terp stood still. I saw his hands shaking. “Translate it, or I’ll find someone who will.” 

\*\*\*

That was when I stepped outside and lit a cigarette. I just didn’t want to be inside anymore. Outside, the sun was still brutal. Another squad had rounded up four military-age males—two of them teens, maybe 16. One was wearing blue sandals and a white tunic that looked like it hadn’t been washed in a month.

The other was older, maybe 20 and walked with a crutch. PFC Knox had them lined up on their knees, zip-tied. One of them had a bloody lip already. 

Franks was pacing behind them with his m4, cigarette hanging from his mouth. Hudson came out a few minutes later, nodding to Franks. “You two,” he said, pointing. “Get the cripple and the tall one up. Walk'em over behind the wall.”

 I watched them go. Looking back, I knew what was coming, but I didn’t think it at the time. Or maybe because things were just happening so fast—-I don’t know. 

But maybe, thirty seconds later, I heard two shots. Just two muffled cracks behind the compound wall. I didn’t ask. Me and Santiago looked at each other, but we didn’t say anything. 

Franks came back wiping his hands on his trousers like he’d just finished a field dressing drill. He didn’t look at anyone. Just lit another cigarette. 

Hudson stepped past me, calm as ever. “Next house,” he said. “Move.” 

\*\*\*

We swept through three more compounds. They were all the same—dusty floors, stale flatbread, scared faces and no weapons.. Just men and women trying not to make eye contact. Trying to disappear. 

At the fourth house, Cantu kicked open a storeroom and found a crate of old Soviet shells. Rusted 82mm mortars that looked like they’d been sitting since the Mujahideen days.

Might’ve been inoperable. Might’ve been planted. It didn’t matter. Hudson called it a weapons cache and gave the order. “Demo the whole structure. Then pull the males for SSE.” 

SSE—sensitive site exploitation. Supposed to mean bagging documents, biometrics, photos. Instead, Knox and Franks dragged three men out into the courtyard. 

One was screaming that he was a schoolteacher. Another was coughing blood after a boot to the ribs. The third just stared straight ahead, not blinking. 

I started a line six in my notebook. “Staff Sergeant, you want these logged?” He looked at me. “They’ll never make it to battalion. Mark it as cleared. No occupants.” 

That was the moment something cracked for me. I didn’t say anything. Just wrote the grid and left the name blank. 

\*\*\*

The worst came at the final house—a squat mud-brick home with a tarp nailed across the doorway. I was on comms, holding rear security with Santiago. But I could hear everything. 

“Room clear,” Knox called. Then: “Two males. Unarmed.” Hudson entered and I followed a few seconds later. 

One of them was just a kid—maybe seventeen, wiry, couldn’t have weighed more than 120 soaking wet. He was shaking. Hands zip-tied behind his back. 

The other was older, probably mid-40s, missing his right leg below the knee. He sat propped against the wall, breathing hard. Neither had so much as a fucking screwdriver on them. Hudson motioned to the terp. “What are they saying?” 

The terp looked uneasy. “Older man says he’s the uncle. Says he hates Taliban. Says Taliban killed son last year for helping Americans.” 

Hudson knelt down next to the kid. “You ever shoot Americans?” The kid just shook his head. I don’t think he even understood the question. 

Then Hudson turned to the terp. “Ask him.” The terp repeated it. He got the same terrified shake of the head. Then Hudson asked something in English the terp didn’t bother translating: 

“Where’s the fucking cache?”

 At that point Hudson stood up. Pulled his M9 from its holster, aimed down and shot the older guy point-blank in the face.

 Just like that. No warning. The pop echoed off the walls like slamming a door. I fucking swear I can still hear the ringing in my ear. Blood sprayed the wall. 

The guy's body slumped sideways like someone yanked a puppet string. The kid starts screaming and Hudson pistol whipped him to shut him up.

 The terp snapped. He started yelling at Hudson in Pashto. I couldn’t understand what he was saying. Hudson pointed his pistol at the terp and that seemed to settle him down but Hudson kept his weapon pointed at the terp’s head. 

\*\*\*

I  don’t know what came over me, but for some reason I stepped in front of the terp and grabbed his arm. “Stop,” I said. “That’s enough.” Hudson glared at me. For a second, I thought he was going to shoot me too.

 But he holstered his weapon and walked out. My hand hovered over the radio, but I didn’t key the mic. I remember thinking that’s some seriously fucked up shit. I glanced at my watch. 1926 local. Wrote it in my log. Out of habit.

 After the last building was cleared, Hudson gave the order. “Demo. Burn it.” I didn’t say anything. I just helped wire the charges. 

\*\*\*

We lit the fires. Smoke rose fast. Black, choking, oily. There was something else in it—something heavy, chemical, almost sweet. Like burning rubber and hair. I couldn’t scrub it off. Couldn’t get it out of my nose. I swear I still smell it on my skin sometimes. In my sweat. In the threads of my old gear I can’t throw away. 

Even now, sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night, I swear I can still smell it. 

No one said anything to each other when we hiked down that hill. Seven dead. No report filed. 

Next morning, I asked LT Somers about it. He didn’t look up from his notebook. ""Village 41 was empty when we arrived. That’s what goes in the log. Understood?"" I nodded. 

We never spoke of it again.

\*\*\*

 Two years later, I was out of the Army. I didn’t reenlist. I couldn’t wear the uniform again. I took some college courses but nothing panned out. 

Bounced from one job to another. 

I started drinking heavy for a while until I woke  up one morning on the kitchen floor with my M9 next to me and a dry cigarette taste in my throat. 

I never pulled the trigger, but I’d chambered a round. That was enough.

 I went to Jamaica Plain VA Medical Center in Boston. Thought maybe I’d talk to someone. Instead, I spent five hours in a waiting room with a clipboard and some bored civilian behind glass telling me they “could probably get me in by November.” It was June. 

When I finally saw a guy—some contractor, not even a doctor—“Have you ever experienced a high-stress event you felt unprepared for, in a professional capacity?” I almost laughed.

 They gave me a packet, a referral to group therapy in a strip mall, and a warning not to mix meds with alcohol. I left the packet on the seat of my truck and never looked at it again. 

While sitting on my couch one evening, eating pizza, scrolling my laptop, I noticed that someone shared a link to Army Times. “Los Angeles California Soldier Awarded Bronze Star for Valor in Iraq.”

 It was Hudson. Diyala Province. Convoy ambush. He’d led a counterattack, pulled a wounded driver out of a burning humvee. 

Picture showed him clean-shaven, medals squared away. They called him ""an example of leadership under fire.""

 I stared at his picture for a while, then I closed the laptop.

The man who earned that medal wasn’t the one I remember.

I remember Village 41. And the smell that still sticks to me like burned skin. And the blood that didn’t dry until long after we left that valley behind.

\*\*\*

Last night, I woke up to static hissing from the old Baofeng scanner on my coffee table. I used to keep it on just to catch police chatter — made the nights less lonely after the divorce. 

I hadn’t touched it in weeks, but last night it was buzzing like it had a mind of its own.

I got out of bed. Took a few steps into the hall.

And then I heard it—a faint voice breaking through the static.

“Contact right side. 3 o’clock.” The voice was mine.

Clear as it was that day. June 11th. Kunar.

Village 41.

And he was there.

Chang.

Lying flat in the hallway—same gurgle. Same fucking helpless twitch of a man choking on his own blood from that 7.62 that tore a hole in his neck.

He locked eyes with me and said the last thing he ever said on that patrol:

“You think they got mango Rip-Its at the COP?”

After I rubbed my eyes, the hallway was empty again.

The Baofeng clicked off on its own.

I swear the air in the hallway still smelled like cordite. Just for a second. Just like Kunar.

I don’t know if I’m cracking up, or if Village 41 still has its hooks in me.

The majestic Himalayas beckon, offering a profound escape into nature's grandeur. For many, the dream of standing amidst these colossal peaks is a powerful draw, a call to adventure that resonates deeply. Among the myriad trekking opportunities in Nepal, the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek stands out as a journey into the very heart of the Annapurna Sanctuary, a natural amphitheater surrounded by some of the world's most breathtaking mountains. This expedition is celebrated for its stunning panoramas, breathtaking landscapes, rich cultural encounters, and the deep connection it fosters with the natural world. It is widely regarded as one of Nepal's most preferred trekking trails. This comprehensive guide aims to illuminate every facet of the Annapurna Base Camp trek, from meticulous preparation to ensuring safety, empowering readers to transform their Himalayan dream into a well-planned reality.

The Annapurna Base Camp trek is frequently characterized as a moderate and beginner-friendly endeavor. This positioning is a deliberate approach to broaden its appeal beyond seasoned trekkers, effectively reducing perceived barriers to entry for a wider demographic that might otherwise be daunted by higher altitudes or more technically demanding climbs. The factual basis for this classification lies in the trek's gradual ascent and its maximum altitude, which is considerably lower than that of other prominent high-altitude treks in the region. This makes the ABC trek an accessible and appealing entry point into the world of Himalayan trekking.

# Unveiling the [Annapurna Base Camp Trek](https://www.amigotrekking.com/annapurna-base-camp-trek.html): What to Expect

The Annapurna Base Camp trek unfolds within the Annapurna region of Nepal, a majestic expanse that is home to Mount Annapurna, the world's 10th-highest mountain. The trek's ultimate destination is the Annapurna Sanctuary, a unique glacial basin encircled by a formidable array of towering peaks. These include the formidable Annapurna I, Annapurna South, Hiunchuli, the iconic Machhapuchhre (often referred to as Fishtail Mountain), and Gangapurna, creating a truly awe-inspiring natural amphitheater.

The highest point reached on the trek is Annapurna Base Camp itself, situated at an elevation of 4,130 meters (approximately 13,550 feet) above sea level. This altitude is a significant factor in the trek's moderate classification. When compared to the higher elevations encountered on the Annapurna Circuit, which scales the 5,416-meter Thorung La Pass, or the Everest Base Camp trek, reaching 5,364 meters, the Annapurna Base Camp's elevation is notably lower. This comparatively lower altitude contributes to the trek being less cold than its higher-altitude counterparts and is associated with fewer altitude-related incidents, enhancing its safety profile.

The duration of the Annapurna Base Camp trek can vary significantly, offering flexibility to trekkers with different time constraints. Options range from accelerated 6-7 day itineraries to a more classic 12-day journey. Longer variations can extend to 13-14 days, and for those seeking an extensive exploration of the Annapurna region, combined treks incorporating highlights like the Annapurna Circuit, Tilicho Lake, and Muktinath can last up to 27 days. Daily trekking typically involves 5 to 7 hours of walking, covering distances of 10 to 15 kilometers per day . The total round-trip distance for the core ABC trek is approximately 67 to 75 kilometers. The trail itself is characterized by a moderate climb, gradually ascending from around 850 meters to 4,130 meters, with a mix of uphill and downhill sections. This gradual ascent is a key feature that contributes to the trek's accessibility.

The wide variation in trek duration for the Annapurna Base Camp trek underscores a strategic market adaptation by trekking operators. This flexibility allows them to cater to a diverse range of travelers, accommodating those with limited vacation time, individuals preferring a more leisurely pace, or adventurers aspiring to a comprehensive regional exploration. For instance, the core ABC trek can be completed relatively quickly in 7 to 9 days through accelerated versions. The longer 10 to 14-day durations often incorporate additional acclimatization days, side trips such as Poon Hill, or a more relaxed daily schedule. The most extended durations, reaching up to 27 days, clearly integrate other major regional treks like the Annapurna Circuit, Tilicho Lake, and Muktinath. This inherent adaptability makes the Annapurna Base Camp trek a highly marketable and appealing option for a broad spectrum of adventurers.

Why the Annapurna Base Camp Trek is Your Next Adventure

The Annapurna Base Camp trek offers an unparalleled blend of natural splendor and cultural richness, making it an exceptional choice for adventurers. Trekkers are consistently treated to spectacular views of the Annapurna range, including the prominent peaks of Annapurna I, Annapurna South, Hiunchuli, Machhapuchhre, and Gangapurna. The journey showcases a remarkable transition in landscapes, moving from lush subtropical forests to diverse alpine terrain, including beautiful bamboo and rhododendron forests . During the spring season, the trails burst into life with dazzling arrays of wildflowers and blooming rhododendrons, transforming the Nepalese Himalayan belt into a vibrant, colorful spectacle.

Beyond its natural beauty, the trek provides a profound opportunity for cultural immersion. The route passes through multi-ethnic villages, such as Ghandruk, a picturesque settlement predominantly inhabited by the Gurung community. Here, trekkers can explore local Gurung culture, customs, museums, and traditional lifestyles, gaining a deeper appreciation for the region's heritage. The warmth of local interactions, particularly in the teahouses along the trail, adds another layer to the experience, fostering connections with fellow trekkers and locals alike.

The Annapurna Base Camp trek is widely recognized for its accessibility and suitability for a broad audience. It is consistently described as moderate and beginner-friendly, making it appropriate for trekkers of all ages who possess a decent level of general fitness. Notably, previous high-altitude experience is not a prerequisite for undertaking this trek. The gradual ascent profile of the trail significantly aids in acclimatization, reducing the risk of altitude-related issues. Furthermore, the well-trodden trails connect iconic places, and the route is marked, minimizing the chances of getting lost.

The seamless integration of natural beauty, encompassing panoramic mountain vistas and diverse ecosystems, with profound cultural immersion, evident in visits to Gurung villages and interactions within teahouses, crafts a holistic adventure experience that extends far beyond a mere physical challenge. This comprehensive approach appeals to a wider spectrum of travelers who seek enriching and multifaceted journeys. Unlike treks focused solely on summiting peaks, the Annapurna Base Camp trek offers a multi-sensory engagement. The visual and physical stimulation derived from the stunning natural splendor and the thrilling Annapurna valley is complemented by the human dimension of cultural encounters and positive interactions with local communities. This harmonious combination transforms a demanding physical endeavor into a deeply memorable and gratifying journey, satisfying both the desire for outdoor activity and a yearning for cultural exploration.

# Timing Your Trek: The Best Seasons for an Unforgettable Journey

Selecting the optimal time for the Annapurna Base Camp trek is crucial for maximizing the experience, with prime seasons offering ideal weather and trail conditions.

The most favorable periods for the trek are **Spring (March to May)** and **Autumn (September to November)**. Spring is characterized by the widespread blooming of flowers across the trekking trails, creating a lush and colorful landscape adorned with dazzling arrays of wildflowers and rhododendrons. During this period, the weather becomes gentler, and snow begins to melt, making for pleasant trekking conditions. For instance, in March, daytime temperatures at Annapurna Base Camp typically hover around 8°C (46°F).

Autumn, following the heavy monsoon rains, is also considered a most pleasant and favorable season. The weather becomes clear and dry, offering pristine blue skies and mild temperatures. Days are generally warm and sunny, with temperatures ranging from 10-20°C (50-68°F) at lower altitudes, while nights are cooler, dropping to 0-10°C (32-50°F). October is particularly ideal, with minimal rainfall and consistently clear skies. November typically records the least amount of rainfall and is the warmest month of autumn in terms of sunshine.

While Spring and Autumn are universally recommended as the prime seasons due to optimal weather, a deeper understanding reveals nuances within each month and the unique challenges and rewards presented by off-peak seasons. For example, early Autumn, particularly September, can still experience residual rain as the monsoon season concludes . Conversely, late November may see the onset of colder winter conditions. Trekking during winter, though colder with temperatures potentially dropping to -10°C to -15°C (14°F to 5°F) at higher elevations, and with heavy snowfall causing disruptions above 4,500 meters, offers a unique sense of solitude, as trekkers are unlikely to share the mountains with many others. This necessitates warmer gear and prepares trekkers for more challenging conditions. The monsoon months of June to August, while generally riskier due to heavy rain, slippery trails, leeches, and potential landslides, also present poor visibility. This understanding indicates that the ""best time"" is subjective and depends on individual preferences, such as prioritizing clear mountain views, vibrant flora, or the tranquility of fewer crowds. This nuanced perspective allows trekkers to choose the most suitable time for their personal priorities.

# Essential Preparations for Your ABC Expedition

Embarking on the Annapurna Base Camp trek requires thoughtful preparation across several key areas to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.

# Physical Fitness

The Annapurna Base Camp trek is categorized as moderately challenging, involving long days of walking over uneven terrain with significant steep ascents and descents. Therefore, a targeted physical training regimen is highly recommended.

**Endurance and Cardiovascular Health:** Building endurance is paramount, as daily treks can last 5 to 8 hours. Regular cardio exercises such as walking and jogging, 4 to 5 times a week, are excellent starting points. Incorporating activities like cycling, swimming, or hiking can diversify the routine. Longer walks, around 10 to 15 kilometers while carrying a light backpack, help simulate trek conditions . Stair climbing is particularly effective for preparing legs and lungs for uphill sections. Weekday cardio workouts should ideally last at least an hour, with weekend sessions extending for multiple hours as the trek date approaches.

**Strength Training:** Strong legs and a robust core are invaluable for navigating steep trails and carrying a backpack. Simple bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, step-ups, and calf raises strengthen the lower body, while planks and push-ups build core stability and balance. Training with a weighted backpack (5-7 kg) can further acclimate the body to carrying weight on the trail.

**Flexibility:** Trekking places considerable strain on the legs, hips, and back. Incorporating at least 10 minutes of stretching after every training session, focusing on hamstrings, calves, thighs, hips, and the lower back, is beneficial. Yoga can also enhance breathing and balance.

**Training Hikes:** The most critical preparation involves undertaking numerous hikes that mimic the challenges of the Annapurna Base Camp trek. These should include long daily hikes, steep inclines, and uneven footpaths, and if possible, training in cold conditions.

**Timeline:** It is advisable to commence training at least three months before the trek, with an ideal preparation period extending to six months.

**Mental Preparedness:** Beyond physical conditioning, mental fortitude is essential. Trekkers should be prepared for the occasional discomfort of basic teahouse accommodations and unpredictable weather. Practicing deep breathing, short meditation, and mindfulness can help manage fatigue and stress on the trail.

# Permits and Paperwork

Two essential permits are required for the Annapurna Base Camp trek: the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) and the Trekkers' Information Management System (TIMS) card. The ACAP costs NRs 3000 (approximately USD 22-25) for foreign nationals. The TIMS card costs NRs 2000 (USD 17-18) for solo trekkers and NRs 1000 (USD 9) for those trekking with a guide as part of a group.

These permits can be obtained in Nepal, either in Kathmandu at the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) or in Pokhara at the ACAP Entry Permit Counter. An online application option for the ACAP is also available, though it incurs an additional 2.9% fee. To apply, trekkers must present their passport, a photocopy of their passport, and 2 to 4 passport-sized photos. Additionally, a clear map of the trekking route, specified entrance and exit points, local and family emergency contact information, and details of travel insurance are necessary.

A significant development in trekking regulations, effective April 1st, 2023, mandates that all international trekkers must have a licensed guide for most trekking routes in Nepal, including the Annapurna Circuit. This regulation strongly implies that a guide is also necessary for the Annapurna Base Camp trek, as it falls within the same region. While previous information indicated that solo trekking was possible, the new rules render such advice outdated. The requirement for a guide, which typically costs between USD 25 to USD 35 per day, directly impacts the overall trek cost but also streamlines logistics, as trekking agencies often handle permit acquisition. More importantly, a licensed guide significantly enhances safety by providing support for altitude sickness management, navigation, and emergency response. This regulatory change likely aims to improve safety standards and better regulate the trekking industry.

a

# Packing Smart

A well-prepared packing list is essential for comfort and safety on the Annapurna Base Camp trek.

**Clothing:** Layering is critical due to the unpredictable weather conditions and significant temperature fluctuations. The packing list should include moisture-wicking tank tops or t-shirts, long-sleeved tops, fleece tops, a warm down jacket, and both waterproof jacket and trousers.

**Footwear:** Worn-in hiking boots are indispensable. Trekkers should also pack several pairs of trekking socks (at least 5 pairs are recommended)and comfortable 'teahouse' pants or sliders for relaxing in the evenings.

**Essential Gear:** A sleeping bag is highly recommended, even though teahouses provide basic blankets. Hiking poles are invaluable for support and balance on varied terrain. A headtorch is crucial for early morning starts or navigating in the dark. A reusable water bottle or hydration bladder is necessary, as the sale of plastic water bottles is controlled within the Annapurna Sanctuary . Water purification tablets or a LifeStraw are also vital for safe drinking water.

**Personal Items:** Sunscreen, lip balm with SPF, and moisturizer are important for skin protection in the harsh mountain environment. Hand sanitizer, biodegradable wet wipes (recommended over traditional wipes), and toilet paper should be carried. A basic first-aid kit, including pain relievers, bandages, antiseptic liquid, medication for altitude sickness (such as Acetazolamide), and an oximeter, is a necessity. Any personal prescription medications must also be included.

**Electronics:** A power bank or portable charger and a travel adapter are essential for keeping devices charged, as electricity access can be limited and incur extra costs at teahouses.

**Miscellaneous:** High-energy snacks are advisable due to limited options on the trail.A padlock for securing belongings, a book, games, or cards for downtime, and sufficient cash are also important, as ATMs are not available until the trek's conclusion.

The comprehensive nature of the packing list, particularly the emphasis on clothing layers, water purification, and a personal first-aid kit, highlights the unpredictable and self-reliant character of high-altitude trekking, even on a trail classified as ""moderate."" The need for multiple layers underscores the significant temperature fluctuations encountered throughout the trek. Environmental regulations, such as the control over plastic water bottles in the Sanctuary, and the recommendation for water purification methods, point to limited access to bottled water at higher altitudes. The inclusion of personal toiletries, toilet paper, and a thorough first-aid kit reflects the basic amenities available at teahouses and the necessity for trekkers to be self-sufficient for minor health issues. This detailed preparation reinforces the understanding that while the trek is accessible, it remains a remote, high-altitude expedition where trekkers must be adequately prepared for varying conditions and limited external support.

# Life on the Trail: A Glimpse into Your Daily Trek

The Annapurna Base Camp trek offers a unique daily rhythm, characterized by scenic walks, teahouse stays, and opportunities for relaxation.

# Common Itineraries and Overnight Stops

While specific itineraries can vary in duration and route, common overnight stops form the backbone of most Annapurna Base Camp treks. These typically include picturesque villages and settlements such as Ghandruk, Chhomrong, Bamboo, Dovan, Himalaya Hotel, Machhapuchhre Base Camp (MBC), Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) itself, and Jhinu Danda. A typical 7-day itinerary might involve starting from Pokhara or Kathmandu and driving to Ghandruk, then trekking to Chhomrong, followed by Bamboo, ascending to ABC via MBC, and then descending to Bamboo before concluding the trek by driving from Siwai back to Pokhara. Longer, classic treks like the 12-day option involve covering greater daily distances.

# Accommodation and Food at Teahouses

Throughout the Annapurna Base Camp trek, almost all teahouses and lodges provide food and accommodation. Trekkers should anticipate basic amenities and simple teahouse accommodations. Rooms are typically twin-sharing, furnished with comfortable bedding and blankets. Shared bathrooms are common, particularly at higher altitudes like Sinuwa and Bamboo. At Annapurna Base Camp and Deurali, dormitory-style rooms are often provided. Dining areas are communal, fostering a sense of camaraderie among trekkers. It is a common practice, and often a rule, that trekkers are expected to eat their meals at the teahouse where they are staying to secure a room.

Food options generally include the local staple, Dal Bhat, alongside a variety of pasta dishes, rice, and eggs. For those on guided packages, meals are typically included. Independent trekkers should budget approximately USD 20-30 per day for meals and drinks . Additional services such as hot showers, Wi-Fi, and gadget charging are available at most teahouses but usually incur extra charges, ranging from USD 2 to 5 per day.

# The Experience of Natural Hot Springs

A significant highlight for many trekkers is the opportunity to relax in the natural hot springs at Jhinu Danda. These rejuvenating springs are located by the Modi River and offer a perfect way to soothe tired muscles and recover after the physical demands of the trek, all while enjoying views of the lush landscape.

The ""teahouse culture"" is not merely a logistical arrangement but a fundamental and integrated component of the Annapurna Base Camp trek experience, influencing everything from daily logistics to social interactions and even safety. Teahouses serve as central hubs for food, water, rest, charging electronic devices, and accessing Wi-Fi. The communal dining areas and the opportunity to interact with other trekkers and local residents contribute significantly to the social fabric of the journey, fostering a unique sense of community. The expectation that trekkers dine where they stay highlights a symbiotic relationship between visitors and local businesses, supporting the mountain communities . Furthermore, teahouses can serve as informal information centers and, in some cases, provide basic medical supplies or bottled oxygen. During peak season, the necessity of sometimes sleeping in dining halls further underscores their critical role in managing the flow of trekkers. This integration means the teahouse experience profoundly shapes the trek's character, managing trekkers' expectations regarding comfort while emphasizing the authenticity and communal spirit of the adventure.

# Trekking Safely: Navigating Risks and Ensuring Well-being

While the Annapurna Base Camp trek is considered moderate, thorough preparation and awareness of potential risks are crucial for a safe and rewarding experience.

# Understanding Altitude Sickness (AMS) and Acclimatization

The Annapurna Base Camp trek reaches an elevation of 4,130 meters, where oxygen levels are significantly lower than at sea level. This reduced oxygen availability poses a risk of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) . Symptoms of AMS can include headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, immediate descent to a lower altitude is critical.

Effective prevention and acclimatization strategies are vital. Trekkers should ascend gradually, aiming to gain no more than 300-500 meters in elevation per day. Incorporating rest days at intermediate villages like Chhomrong or Bamboo allows the body to adjust to the increasing altitude. While a dedicated acclimatization day is not always strictly required due to the trek's gradual ascent, maintaining a slow and steady pace is key. Staying well-hydrated by drinking at least 2-3 liters of water daily and avoiding alcohol is essential. Listening to one's body and recognizing early symptoms is paramount. Eating a balanced diet rich in carbohydrates also supports acclimatization. Medications such as Acetazolamide (Diamox) can be helpful, but their use should always be discussed with a healthcare professional prior to the trek.

# Common Trail Hazards and Mitigation

The Annapurna region's weather can be unpredictable, with sudden rain, snow, or significant temperature drops occurring even during peak trekking seasons. Trekkers should pack appropriate layers and regularly check weather forecasts. Trail conditions can also present hazards. Landslides and rockfalls are possible, particularly during the monsoon season. In winter, higher sections of the trail may become slippery due to snow and ice. While the trail is generally well-marked and maintained, caution is always advised. Common injuries on the ABC trek include ankle sprains, bruises, and minor cuts, often resulting from slips and falls on uneven terrain . The use of trekking poles can significantly aid balance and reduce the risk of such incidents . During the monsoon, trekkers might encounter leeches.

# The Importance of Comprehensive Travel Insurance

Comprehensive travel insurance is an essential component of preparation for the Annapurna Base Camp trek. It is strongly recommended that policies include coverage for helicopter rescue, medical emergencies, trip cancellations, and loss or damage of equipment.Helicopter evacuation is crucial in cases of severe AMS or serious injury, as these operations can be extremely costly, often ranging from USD 5,000 to USD 10,000. It is important to note that helicopter rescue operations are frequent in the Annapurna region, with 20 to 30 incidents reported monthly during peak trekking season.

Most standard travel insurance policies typically cover altitudes only up to around 3,000 meters. Given that Annapurna Base Camp reaches 4,130 meters, specialized high-altitude or adventure sports add-ons are necessary to ensure adequate coverage for any altitude-related illnesses or injuries. Reputable providers such as Global Rescue and World Nomads are often recommended for their comprehensive high-altitude coverage. Medical facilities along the trail are limited, with basic health posts available in villages like Chhomrong and Jhinu Danda . Some teahouses may also stock basic first-aid supplies and bottled oxygen.

Despite the ""moderate"" classification of the Annapurna Base Camp trek, the consistent emphasis on altitude sickness prevention, the unpredictable nature of mountain weather, and the critical need for comprehensive insurance, particularly for helicopter rescue, reveal an underlying, non-trivial risk profile that trekkers must actively manage. The ""moderate"" label primarily pertains to the technical difficulty of the trail, indicating well-trodden paths without the need for specialized climbing skills. However, the environmental and physiological challenges remain significant due to the reduced oxygen levels at altitude, the remote location with limited medical facilities, and the rapid changes in weather. The frequency of helicopter rescues, even for non-fatal incidents, underscores that serious situations, though rare as fatalities, are common enough to necessitate robust emergency planning. This understanding means that while the trek is accessible, it is not risk-free, and proactive preparation, including diligent acclimatization, appropriate gear, and mandatory specialized insurance, is paramount for a safe and enjoyable experience.

The explicit mention of specific insurance providers like Global Rescue and World Nomads, along with detailed explanations of their coverage for high altitudes and helicopter evacuation, points to the existence of a mature and specialized market for trekking insurance. This market is driven by the substantial costs associated with helicopter evacuations and the critical nature of emergencies in remote Himalayan regions. Standard travel insurance policies are often insufficient, as they typically have altitude limitations that exclude coverage for treks like ABC. Therefore, trekkers require specialized coverage that specifically addresses high-altitude risks and emergency medical transport. Recommending specific providers known for this specialized coverage, such as Global Rescue, which is a ""Safe Travel Partner"" for some trekking agencies, adds significant credibility and practical value for the reader, guiding them towards appropriate and reliable solutions rather than generic advice.

A woman in a white T-shirt and jeans walked out of the train station in Douburgh with a suitcase.

Her delicate face turned slightly red as the sun hit her. She tucked wisps of curly hair behind her ears. Under her arched eyebrows were a pair of bright and pretty eyes, a slim nose, and Cherry lips. She looked so beautiful even though she had no make-up on.

""Hello! You are Annabel Hewitt, right? I'm the driver sent by the Benton family.""

Annabel nodded and followed the driver into the car casually. She was already worn out.

On the way, the driver stole glances at the woman, whose eyes were closed as she rested in the back seat.

This woman was Rupert Benton's fiancee.

Rupert Benton was the most eligible bachelor in the city. At just twenty-one years old, he was already the CEO of Benton Group. He was way ahead of his peers. He was a vigorous, resourceful and no-nonsense person, causing many in the business world to be afraid of him.

His grandfather, Bruce Benton, took it upon himself to find a wife for him. And he picked Annabel, a girl from the countryside.

With his hands on the steering wheel, the driver took another look at Annabel's innocent face and clicked his tongue. He envisaged that she would have a hard time with the Benton family.

At this time, Annabel slowly opened her eyes and looked at the strange city with a calm expression.

The car arrived at the Benton family's residence soon. The driver carried Annabel's luggage for her.

Annabel barely had one foot inside the house when a well-dressed woman appeared. She eyed Annabel from head to toe with a look of utter disdain.

""Tracy!""

""Yes, Mrs. Benton.""

As soon as Tracy was given a signal, she began to spray the disinfectant all over Annabel.

The well-dressed woman was Erica Benton, Rupert's mother. With her hands akimbo, she ordered, ""Her shoes and hair. Spray them, too.""

Annabel's face and body were soon covered with droplets of disinfectant. The pungent smell made her nose a little itchy. She uttered coldly, ""What is wrong with you?""

Erica flipped out immediately.

""I heard that you're from the countryside, but I thought you would at least be well-behaved. It appears you are the same as the wayward and rude girls they breed over there. I'm doing this because I don't want you to bring any virus or bacteria into this household. Do you want us to get infected with whatever you are carrying?""

Annabel is not a person who likes to listen to people's nonsense.. She would have walked out if she hadn't made a deal with her grandfather.

""In that case, you should spray some disinfectant in your mouth because it stinks!""

With this, Annabel shoved the servant aside and walked in.

""You... Oh my..."" Erica pointed at Annabel with a trembling hand. Tracy hurriedly comforted her.

In the living room, a girl who looked about the same age as Annabel was sitting on the sofa. She had on designer clothes and bright makeup. Her expression was more condescending than Erica's as she looked at Annabel. She was Rupert's cousin, Cathy Benton.

""Are you Annabel Hewitt, Rupert's fiancee?"" Cathy rolled her eyes when she saw that Annabel wasn't dressed in designer clothes. ""Gosh, Grandpa has no taste. I can't believe he chose someone like you. Anyway, I heard you came here by train. You should have told us you are too poor to afford a plane ticket. We would have bought one for you. Wait, it seems there isn't an airport in the countryside.""

Annabel looked at Cathy with one of her eyebrows raised.

She wondered if every member of this family was so arrogant.

There was indeed no airport where she came from, but her grandfather had booked an entire high-speed train to Douburgh just for her. These arrogant people had no idea that she traveled as luxuriously as someone who flew first class.

Besides, she could have flown here in a private jet if she wanted.

Annabel could easily make it clear to these people, but she didn't. She just went upstairs.

Annoyance clouded Cathy's face once she saw Annabel ascending the stairs. She wasn't used to anyone ignoring her, so she followed her.

""Where is my room?"" Annabel asked the maid behind.

""Here!"" Cathy said, pointing at a door in the hallway before the maid could reply.

She pushed the door open and added condescendingly, ""You have never stayed in a bedroom as big as this, have you? You should cherish it while living in here. I'm Rupert's cousin, Cathy. You should fawn over me if you...""

Cathy had barely finished speaking when Annabel walked into the room and shut the door in her face. This made her angrier.

""Ah! How dare that pauper be so conceited? What was Grandpa thinking?""

The maid warily moved closer and asked, ""Miss, but isn't this Mr. Benton's room?""

Cathy cast a scornful glance at the door.

""Shush! Don't say a word to her. Rupert hates anyone being in his space or using his things. When he finds out that she's here, just tell him that she chose to stay in this room.""

Cathy's eyes glistened with slyness as she spoke.

Chapter 2 Night-long Cuddle

Annabel didn't realize that this room belonged to someone else. When she saw that the bathroom was stocked with only men's products, she just assumed that the Bentons were trying to get on her nerves.

""What an incredible family!"" she muttered sarcastically, walking under the shower.

She only had to put up with this for three months. She had struck a bet with her grandfather. If she still had no feelings for Rupert after staying here for three months, their marriage would be called off.

A maid brought in dinner for her once Annabel got out of the bathroom. She ate it and fell asleep almost immediately.

It was already midnight when Rupert finally came back home from a business dinner.

He was aware Annabel was arriving today. Bruce had told him to pick her up, but he refused under the guise of having many things to do at work. He had no interest in his fiancee. As far as he was concerned, the marriage would be canceled sooner or later.

Rupert was fagged out. He managed to take a shower and went straight to bed.

He was very drunk, so he didn't notice that someone else was in his room until he lay down on his bed.

The large bulge under the quilt startled him. He moved away abruptly. The room was dimly lit, so he couldn't see the woman's face clearly. Before he could think straight, she rolled over and hugged him. She muttered, ""Teddy, don't be naughty. You should sleep now.""

Rupert froze completely.

This woman had a very familiar scent, just like that girl...

It was soothing as his nose pressed against her neck. For some reason, Rupert found himself hugging her back. He fell asleep with Annabel in his arms.

Strangely for an insomniac, Rupert didn't wake up at any point during the night. He slept like a well-fed baby.

He had a dream that night. It was about what happened to him ten years ago. In a dark room, a girl embraced him tightly and said in a sweet voice, ""Don't be scared. No harm shall come to you. I'll protect you.""

Later in the dream, he met that girl again. It felt so real.

The next morning, Cathy woke up at the crack of dawn. She had been hoping to hear the news that Annabel was thrown out of the room once Rupert got back home. But the maid said nothing of such happened.

Why was that? Didn't Rupert come back home last night? But his car was in the garage.

Rupert hated anyone being in his space. He couldn't possibly have slept in the same bed as a strange woman.

Consumed by curiosity and uncertainty, Cathy went to knock on Rupert's door. ""Hey, Rupert! Breakfast is ready. Don't you have a meeting this morning? You should get up now!""

The noise woke up the two people who were fast asleep at the same time. Annabel immediately felt the warmth of someone else. Her head wasn't on a pillow but on a hard chest.

She looked up, only to meet the sharp eyes of a man. She sat up immediately and was wide awake. ""Who are you?""

Rupert's eyes darkened. ""Annabel Hewitt?""

Since he knew her name, Annabel assumed that he was her fiance, Rupert. But why was he in her room?

She was just about to question him again when he uttered, ""You came to my room and slept in my bed on your first day in this household. I must say that you are really something!""

""What?"" Annabel looked completely confused. He just said this was his bed? How was that possible?

Was every member of this family mad and troublesome?

""Oh my!"" Annabel exclaimed as her mind went to the men's products she saw in the bathroom yesterday. It seemed Cathy had tricked her.

In haste, Annabel got off the bed and looked at him coldly. ""Just to be clear, I didn't mean to sleep here. Cathy told me this was my room. No offense but I'm not in any way interested in you. come to think of it, I fell asleep alone. Why didn't you realize that someone else was in the bed when you got back? and why did you hold me in your arms for the whole night? Don't tell me you have a crush on me?""

A look of embarrassment clouded Rupert's face when he heard her words. He couldn't deny that he held her in his arms for the whole night.

Just like last night, he was stunned when he met Annabel's eyes.

Her beautiful eyes were just like that girl's.

Annabel squinted at him with a smile.

""What? Why are you staring at me like that? Are you obsessed with me?""

Rupert came to his senses. His face darkened again. He ordered coldly, ""Get out! And don't come into this room ever again!""

Annabelle gritted her teeth.. She then left with her belongings without hesitation.

This was their first meeting, but they already didn't like each other.

Cathy, who was still at the door, was surprised to see Annabel come out.

Annabel said with an ambiguous smile, ""Good morning! As you wish, your cousin held me in his arms and slept for the whole night. We got along pretty well. You must be happy about that.""

""Nonsense!"" Cathy's face was livid. She didn't believe that at all.

In her opinion, there was no way Rupert would like Annabel, let alone hold her in his arms for hours.

But the fact that they had slept together for the whole night was plain to see.

Chapter 3 New Secretary

Annabel walked away with a fake smile.

Cathy lost it. ""You bumpkin! Stop right there. I'm not done talking. Let me tell you, Rupert won't marry you!""

Just then, Rupert walked out of the room.

""Ermm... Rupert..."" Cathy stuttered, moving back in fear.

Rupert's face darkened. It was obvious that he was angry, so Cathy didn't dare to say anything more.

Annabel asked a maid to take her to her room. She unpacked her things and then went downstairs for breakfast.

Erica, Cathy, and Rupert were already seated at the dining table.

Erica began to criticize her as soon as Annabel sat down. ""Weren't you taught proper etiquette? Not only did you wake up so late, but you also didn't bother preparing breakfast. Do you think you're already the hostess here?""

Taking a glance at Erica, Annabel said flatly, ""I'm not a servant either.""

She would never make breakfast for this family.

Although Rupert didn't say anything as the two argued, there was no denying that he didn't like Annabel either.

The atmosphere in the dining room was tense. They ate in silence for most of the time. After breakfast, Erica held out a bank card to Annabel.

""This card is loaded with about five thousand dollars. Buy yourself some decent clothes before going to the company. Remember to behave well. You mustn't cause any trouble for Rupert.""

To develop the relationship between the two, Bruce proposed that Annabel work in the company as Rupert's secretary. Leonard Hewitt, Annabel's grandfather, agreed to the arrangement. She didn't refuse. After all, it was only temporary.

Her new employment was no biggie for her, but the bank card was! It was obvious that Erica looked down on her. ""Thanks, but no thanks,"" Annabel said in a sarcastic manner.

There was nothing wrong with her clothes, as far as she was concerned. They were specially made for her. That was why the Bentons thought they were not designer clothes. Without waiting for Erica or anyone else to retort, she went upstairs to get ready for work.

She had just gotten into her room when her phone buzzed. It was a bank notification. The sum of fifty million dollars had been transferred into her account.

A text message from Leonard came through.

""Dear, I hope they are treating you well over there. I transferred some money to your account. Buy whatever you want. And don't forget to inform me if anyone bullies you. I love you.""

Annabel smiled and texted back, ""Grandpa, I'm not happy here. They are bullying me. It's not funny at all.""

Leonard replied almost immediately, ""Glad to hear that. Anyway, I'm going fishing. Talk to you later.""

Annabel couldn't believe her eyes.

Sighing, she changed into a professional suit and walked out of the house. The driver opened the door for her. As soon as she got into the car, she found that Rupert was also inside.

""Didn't you say that you had no interest in me? Why did you agree to work as my secretary then?"" His charming voice had a hint of irony in it. There was also a smirk at the corners of his lips.

""Don't get any ridiculous ideas just because I agreed. I promised my grandpa to stay with you for three months. Once the timeline expires, we will cancel the marriage,"" Annabel responded, glancing at him indifferently.

""Huh?"" Rupert sneered. ""Aren't you worried that you will fall in love with me in the next three months? I guess you'll be reluctant to leave then.""

Annabel was amused by his words.

""Funny you, Rupert. You clearly have a swollen head. For your information, I will never fall for you. Get down from your high horse.""

Although Annabel knew that Rupert was good-looking, that didn't matter to her. He had the repulsive character that she hated in men.

Rupert pulled a long face at her words.

She would never fall for him?

""We will see about that, Annabel. Don't ever forget what you said just now!""

In Rupert's opinion, Annabel was just playing hard to get. Why did she come to his home if she didn't feel a thing for him or wanted to be his wife?

Annabel smiled and said, ""Okay, I'll keep it in mind. Don't worry. In three months, we will go our separate ways. By the way, we have to pretend not to know each other at the company. I don't want unnecessary drama there.""

Rupert kept in silent.

Unbeknown to Annabel, she couldn't avoid drama at work. The news about Rupert's engagement had already spread like wildfire. People also knew that his fiancee was from the countryside.

The employees in Benton Group were in a heated discussion.

""Guys, have you heard the latest? Mr. Benton's fiancee will work here. She will be his secretary!""

""Oh my! I heard she's ugly. And that she's from the countryside. Since she's poor, she must have attended a substandard college. Can she even understand the documents?""

""Ha-ha! You can say that again. The way I see it, she won't be able to operate a computer.""

The words of the gossipers trailed off as soon as Rupert walked in with Annabel. Everyone's jaw dropped when they saw them.

Chapter 4 His Superwoman

""Look! Who is that woman that came in with Mr. Benton? She's so beautiful and elegant!""

""Wow! Her legs are so straight and thin! I have never seen anyone as beautiful as her!""

""Is she Mr. Benton's fiancee?""

""How is that possible? It can't be!""

Many of the employees began to wonder who Annabel was. The most common guess was that she was a business partner. But when she left Rupert and went into the personnel department to sign in, they all realized who she was. The news spread in the company in no time.

It turned out that the woman who came in with Rupert was Annabel.

People didn't know what to believe anymore. Didn't they say that Annabel was an ugly bumpkin? How come she was drop-dead gorgeous?

While Annabel was going over the necessary formalities, the employees in the secretarial department were gossiping about her.

""Annabel is so beautiful! She's even prettier than Heather Norman!"" an employee commented.

Nina Jones, the head of the department, had a frown on her face and disdain in her eyes. She said maliciously, ""Looks aren't everything. Beauty doesn't change the fact that she's a poor village girl who doesn't know anything about city life. She's not worthy enough to be Mr. Benton's wife.""

Annabel had just walked into the secretarial department when she heard these words. A hint of irony flashed in her eyes. She retorted in a clear voice, ""If I'm not worthy enough to be his wife, who is? You?""

Nina's face froze. She looked away and didn't dare to retort. She couldn't afford to offend Annabel.

""Ahem! Mr. Benton earlier told me to treat you like every other person in this department. You will receive a fair amount of work despite your status. Here is the document about the advertisement the company is going to shoot today. It's yours to handle.""

With a sneer, Annabel took the document and left.

The others surrounded Nina again.

""Nina, is it Marcel's shoot? Annabel is new. Don't you think she will screw it up?""

A spark of mischief shone in Nina's eyes. The face of the advertisement was Marcel Brooks—a young and bad-tempered celebrity. He was hard to please and work with. People always avoided him. She looked forward to seeing Annabel mess things up on her first day.

As soon as Annabel got out, she went through the document that outlined the process of the advertisement. She raised her eyebrows when she saw Marcel's name in there; it was familiar.

In the CEO's office, Rupert's assistant asked him, ""Nina Jones handed over Marcel's shoot to Miss Hewitt just now. Should I order someone to replace her?""

Marcel's elder brother was a friend of Rupert's since childhood. Everyone knew that Marcel had a bad temper. It went without saying that Annabel would suffer a lot at his hands if she worked with him today.

Remembering what Annabel said to him this morning, Rupert finally replied, ""No, let her do it.""

He would take delight in her suffering.

The company was in charge of everything for the shoot. Annabel and some employees went downstairs to welcome Marcel.

A few minutes passed before a black Bentley drove into Benton Group's premises. Marcel got out wearing a pair of sunglasses. At the age of nineteen, he already had millions of fans all over the world. His fame contributed to his arrogance. He held his head up high and walked like he owned the place.

Annabel walked up to him and extended her hand for a handshake. ""Welcome, Mr. Brooks. I'm Annabel Hewett, the person in charge of the shoot. It's my pleasure to meet you.""

Marcel didn't take her hand or exchange pleasantries. He just complained with a frown, ""It's so hot. Why didn't you bring an umbrella? Anyway, is everything all set? I don't have time to waste. By the way, buy me a cup of coffee before we begin anything. Don't get me a cheap one. I want one from that cafe downtown. They make the best...""

Marcel's words trailed off when he finally looked at the woman's face. His jaw dropped.

""Holy moly! Annabel! Am I dreaming?""

Marcel took off his sunglasses and still looked incredulous.

He hugged Annabel excitedly.

""Annabel? Why are you here? You work here? When did that happen? Shouldn't you be traveling around the world now?""

Annabel stroked Marcel's head and said with a smile, ""Marc, long time no see. What did you say you wanted to drink again?""

""Nothing! I didn't say anything. What would you like to drink? I can get it for you.""

Everyone present was dumbfounded, to say the least.

The ever-so-arrogant Marcel not only hugged Annabel but was also speaking to her politely. He even allowed her to stroke his head.

Was this really Marcel or some clone who was passing off as him?

Could it be that he was so respectful because Annabel was Rupert's fiancee? But he was usually arrogant in Rupert's presence. What was going on?

The truth was that Annabel and Marcel met two years ago.

At that time, Marcel was seventeen. He was filming in the countryside, very close to Annabel's home.

Some thugs kidnapped him. Fortunately, Annabel saved him by chance.

Marcel had fearfully watched her beat up the kidnappers so easily. He had thought he was going to die in captivity, but she had come to his rescue like a superwoman.

She had invited him to her home. Much to his surprise, her home was even bigger than the mansion in Downton Abbey.

It turned out that she was not only kind but also well-to-do. He couldn't help but hold her in high esteem.

Chapter 5 Chivalrous Lad

The two walked into Benton Group. And the shooting went on smoothly.

Some of the clothes weren't up to Marcel's taste. He complained about them. But when Annabel said that they were good, he immediately changed his opinion.

He set aside his nitpicking attitude just because of her. Whenever he went out of line, Annabel's glance brought him to order.

Marcel was intimidated by her. Asides from the fact that he respected her for saving his life, he feared that she would spank him if he annoyed her.

It was estimated that the shoot would take five hours because of Marcel's attitude, but it took only two hours.

Once it ended, Marcel pulled Annabel and said, ""Let's go. We have a lot of catching up to do. I'll treat you to dinner.""

""No, I can't. I'm not off duty yet!"" Annabel refused him coldly.

Some of the employees were still on the set. They pretended to be busy, but they gossiped about the two on the spot.

""What? Marcel offered to buy Annabel dinner but she turned him down.""

""Holy moly! What is she thinking? Doesn't she know who he is? Many girls would jump at the offer. How can she be so arrogant?""

""I wish he could take me instead. I can quit my job just to spend some time with him. Oh, Annabel is so foolish.""

Being rejected, Marcel wanted to cry. After thinking for a while, he asked, ""By the way, why did you start working here? Oh my! Did your family go bankrupt? If so, I can support you. You don't have to slave away here, okay?""

Annabel rolled her eyes and said, ""You know nothing, Marc. Now if you will excuse me...""

She then went back to work.

Everyone who saw the scene thought Marcel would storm out in a fit of pique. To their greatest surprise, he smiled helplessly and went to the lounge to wait for Annabel until she got off work.

By closing hour, Rupert walked out of his office and said to Annabel, ""Grandpa made a reservation at a restaurant. Let's go have dinner there.""

Rupert didn't want to, but Bruce threatened him. The man was hospitalized earlier after having a heart attack. On video call, he said, ""You must go. If you don't, I'll pull the plug on this ventilator. Do you want me to die?""

Rupert's hands were tied, so he had to agree.

Annabel was about to reply when Marcel came in.

""Annabel, you are off duty now, right? Can we have dinner now?""

It wasn't until Rupert coughed slightly that Marcel noticed his presence.

""You are here, Rupert!"" he exclaimed.

Did Annabel and Marcel know each other? Rupert looked at the two in confusion.

Annabel, who had been silent, finally spoke. ""How about we all have dinner together?""

In the end, the three of them went to the restaurant that Bruce reserved earlier.

During the ride, Marcel kept talking to Annabel, who replied in a friendly way from time to time.

When they arrived, Marcel became chivalrous. He opened the door for Annabel and even pulled a chair for her. He also put food on her plate and poured her a glass of red wine.

Rupert was relegated to the background. It was as if these two were in their own world, and he was just there to watch them.

""By the way, you still haven't told me why you decided to work in Benton Group. Is there something between you and Rupert?""

Marcel suspected that they were involved with each other.

Glancing at Rupert, Annabel answered, ""My grandpa asked me to work here. As for what is between us... We are engaged.""

Marcel spat out a mouthful of water.

""You both are what? What a small world we live in! So, you are the countrywoman whom Rupert got engaged to?""

Annabel nodded casually.

The rumor of the engagement was widespread in Douburgh, so Marcel knew about it. Since he knew about Annabel's background, he couldn't help but sigh because of how clueless the media was.

She was indeed from the countryside, but she was far from being poor. The Hewitt family was super rich and had dozens of villas scattered around the world.

""Are you two in love?"" Marcel looked at them in disbelief.

""Don't get the wrong idea. We are not in love. The engagement will be canceled three months later,"" Annabel said calmly.

Marcel breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. Without mincing words, he uttered, ""That's good. Rupert doesn't deserve you. I'm even better than him. You two are nothing alike. He's cold and boring. A marriage between the two of you would be a disaster.""

Rupert knifed the steak on his plate and chewed hard as fury brewed inside him.

He didn't deserve Annabel? What nonsense!

""That reminds me, Marcel. Your brother asked me to buy the car you have always wanted. He plans to give it to you. I think...""

""come on, Rupert. I didn't mean that. Can't you take a joke anymore?"" Marcel smiled awkwardly.

They had a nice meal. After walking out of the restaurant, Annabel and Rupert bid Marcel farewell.

""Bye, Annabel! I'll visit you whenever I'm free.""

Annabel stroked his head again as they hugged. She waved at him. ""Bye, Marc. Take care!""

She petted him as if he were Teddy, her Alaskan Malamute.

He grunted and got into the car. On the way back, he finally complained, ""I see why you boldly said that you'll never fall in love with me. You're in love with someone else.""",1,1753854515.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

His voice sliced through the room like a whip.

I blinked, heat rising to my cheeks as every eye in the conference room swung to me. My hands trembled slightly around the coffee tray, but I held onto it like my life depended on it.

Luca Steele stood at the head of the long glass table, tall, lethal, and entirely too composed for a man who’d just been drenched in a splash of boiling cappuccino. Steam still rose from his tailored black suit, but his steel-gray eyes were colder than ice.

“You’ve worked for me for two years,” he said, each word slow, deliberate, laced with venom. “And you still manage to be a walking disaster. Fix it. Or quit.”

No one dared to breathe.

The coffee stain spread across the crisp white papers in front of him, slowly bleeding into confidential numbers and contract drafts worth millions. I scrambled forward, grabbing tissues from the tray, muttering apologies that sounded too small, too broken, too pathetic.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Steele—”

“Sorry doesn’t clean Armani.” He stepped back, brushing off his sleeve with visible disgust. “And what the *hell* are you wearing?”

I froze.

His eyes dragged over me. Every inch.

My oversized brown cardigan hung off my shoulders like a borrowed curtain. The faded blouse underneath clung to me awkwardly, a button missing near the collar. The olive-green skirt was too long, too wrinkled, and paired horribly with the scuffed, worn-out flats I’d owned since college.

My foundation was two shades too pale. My lipstick was crooked. The jet-black wig I wore hung limply around my face, uncombed and clearly fake. And the massive round sunglasses I wore indoors? That was the final punchline.

I was a caricature. And everyone knew it.

Chuckles rippled softly across the room.

“I’m not running a charity,” Luca said, cutting through the silence. “If you can’t show up looking like a professional, then don’t show up at all.”

He didn’t wait for a response. He turned his back and walked toward the screen, launching into a presentation like I hadn’t just been stripped of every ounce of dignity in front of ten high-ranking executives.

I stood there, cheeks burning, throat tight.

And then I turned and walked out.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut behind me, I collapsed into the farthest stall. My hands gripped the toilet seat as sobs wracked my chest. Quiet, sharp, hopeless sobs.

I didn’t even care about the coffee anymore. Or the cardigan. Or the snickers in the room.

I was just so… *tired*.

Tired of hiding. Tired of pretending. Tired of working ten times harder just to be invisible.

I reached into my purse for tissues and caught my reflection in the mirror through the gap in the stall door.

*God. I did look awful.*

The glasses had fogged up from my breath. My mascara was smudged beneath the frames. And the wig—it sat like a lifeless animal on my head, tangled, greasy, and suffocating. I buried my face into my hands, trying to breathe.

Then—my phone buzzed.

*LUCA STEELE.*

I swallowed hard.

I wiped my face with toilet paper, fixed my lipstick with shaking fingers, tucked a strand of wig behind my ear, and inhaled once. Twice.

By the time I stepped out of the stall, the tears were gone.

*The mask was back.*

I walked through the hallway, the same hallway I walked every day, except now it felt like a spotlight was burning holes in me. Two interns passed by, whispering a little too loudly.

“*She looks like a blind clown.”*

*“I heard she lives in her car*.”

“*She probably has blackmail on him. No way Steele keeps that thing around otherwise.”*

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t break stride. I never did.

Luca’s office loomed ahead, the frosted glass doors tall and foreboding. I stepped in without knocking.

He didn’t look up.

His office was cold, like everything else about him—monochrome, sharp lines, minimal furniture. But he was the only part of the room that radiated heat. Not warmth—heat. Intensity.

Luca Steele, age twenty-nine, CEO of one of the most ruthless corporate empires in the world. Jet-black tousled hair. Perfectly sculpted jawline. That expensive three-day stubble that looked like it belonged on a magazine cover. And those eyes—ice-colored and emotionless.They’d never softened. Not once.

I handed him the corrected reports in silence.

He barely acknowledged me.

“Get me Victoria Ames on the line. And fix the deck from slide 8 onward. It’s sloppy.”

“Yes, Mr. Steele.”

I turned, heading for the door. My phone rang. I paused, glanced at the screen. *Unknown Number.*

“Hello?” I whispered.

A soft voice crackled on the line. “Hi, this is Carla from the reception desk. There’s… um… there’s a man here to see you.”

My stomach tightened. “A man?” I said, confused. “Who?”

She hesitated. “He gave his name. Said you’d recognize it.”

I waited.

1mcyjsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mcyjsk/he_hasnt_changed_but_i_have/,"He hasn't changed, but I have.","I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (33M) for 3 years now. We met at work. I was new, and he had already been there for a while. He had a bit of a career setback at that time, but it didn’t matter to me back then.

We’re not living together. I come from a conservative family with strong values, and he still lives with his extended family. His mom, siblings (with families of their own), and nephews all live in one house. His dad passed away years ago. I, on the other hand, live alone. I’m the youngest in my family, kind of a surprise baby, and my siblings are a lot older than me. My mom passed away when I was 11, and not long after that, my dad moved in with my stepmom. So I pretty much raised myself since high school.

Our first two years were fun. We had so much in common, especially when it came to food. We both love to eat, try new things, and we were proud fur parents. He has six cats, and I had four dogs when we started dating. It was light, easy, and happy.

But everything started to shift in our third year. I got exposed to more opportunities and different kinds of people. I left the industry we were both working in and pursued a career that was more aligned with what I studied. I'm currently working from home full-time and also have a part-time job. I wanted to grow and challenge myself, and thankfully, it paid off. I’m earning over ₱100K a month and have been consistently saving. I’m also planning to go back to school to pursue med proper, so I’ve been focused on building toward that.

My boyfriend works as a freelancer and earns about ₱40K per month. And just to be clear, this isn’t about income differences. What’s bothering me is more about mindset and growth.

There are a few things that have been bothering me:

1. He always complains about his job. He says he’s doing too much but not getting paid enough. I suggested that he try applying for a promotion or consider looking for side jobs, but he just brushes it off. He says it’s pointless.


2. He has strong opinions about the government and politics. Which is okay. But he doesn’t even pay his taxes or contributions. He says it's a waste of money. He still relies on his mom for his laundry, doesn’t know how to cook, and barely cleans his room.


3. He has no savings. I understand that everyone moves at their own pace, but I just don’t see any effort from him to change or improve his financial habits. He spends a lot on unnecessary stuff like random online orders, food deliveries, and games. He also volunteered to pay for his nephew’s braces. While that’s generous, he doesn’t even have enough for himself or for any kind of future planning. Meanwhile, I’ve been putting a lot of effort into budgeting and saving.


4. He keeps saying he wants to lose weight. But he doesn’t go out, doesn’t work out, and doesn’t even meet up with his friends anymore. He literally just stays at home all day, either in front of his PC or on his phone, playing games, watching anime, or reading manga. The only time he goes out is when we have dates. And even then, I’m the one using my car since he doesn’t have one.



And the hardest part to admit… I’m no longer attracted to him. The physical and emotional connection is slowly fading. We haven’t been intimate since November 2023. I’m the one with the higher sex drive, but I always have to initiate and do all the work. It’s exhausting. The last time we had sex, he said, “That’s the most tired I’ve ever been,” and in my head I was like, “I wasn’t even close to done.” I actually finished on my own in my car on the way home. That moment made me realize how distant we’ve become.

He’s a good guy though. When I really need someone, he shows up. He’s calm, respectful, and he trusts me. I once told him about a guy from work who kept giving me food and showing interest in me. My boyfriend simply said, “I trust you.” That meant so much to me. He’s not controlling, not jealous, not the toxic type.

But I feel like I’m in a relationship by myself. These days I just take myself out. Coffee dates, movie nights, milk tea runs. I do everything alone. And honestly, it’s been so long since I felt happy or excited to be with him. I don’t feel kilig anymore. I don’t even remember the last time I looked forward to seeing him.

I feel guilty for thinking about leaving. He’s the only boyfriend my family has ever met. A part of me still hopes he’ll grow up, start making plans, and finally think about our future seriously.

But what if he never does?

Is it wrong to want something more? To want a partner who’s also thinking ahead, working on themselves, making an effort?

I don’t even know if I’m asking for advice. I just really needed to get this off my chest. I feel heavy, tired, and unsure.



Edited:

Lately, whenever we talk about how his day went at work, I find it hard to relate. And I hate to say this, but sometimes I catch myself getting bored. He usually vents about the people in their org or how unfair things are with their benefits. I get that he needs to let it out, but at the same time, I just came from a meeting with stakeholders about tools we can use to improve productivity, reduce turnover, track KPIs, and plan monthly employee events. It’s starting to feel like we’re just in different headspaces.",2,1753854367.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

1mcyj7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mcyj7u/the_doors_in_the_house_dont_lead_where_they_used/,The doors in the house don't lead where they used to,"My brother, Michael, is dead. I should probably lead with that. They found him 10 days ago, but from what the coroner said, he passed a long time before that, at least a month or two. I’ll spare you most of the grisly details that I wish the cops had spared me. He was severely malnourished, dehydrated, and everything else that comes along with that. There was plenty of food and water in the house, and he didn’t have any other injuries aside from some shallow cuts on his arms and hands. Doesn’t make sense, but it seems like he just decided to stop eating and drinking. Obviously not a decision made in any proper state of mind, but that’s unfortunately not too surprising.

I haven’t seen Michael in person for almost a decade. Around the time I went off to college, he was still living at home while he finished up at a local trade school. He wanted to be an electrician, I think. A couple months after I left, out of nowhere, my parents started calling me all upset and worried at least once a week. “Michael keeps disappearing for days at a time.” “Michael keeps yelling nonsense at your father.” “Michael showed up last night all confused.” It was always something new, and it was always about Michael.

I wish I could say I was a good brother and came home to help figure things out. But I didn’t. We were never that close growing up. I was a straight-A student that played clarinet in the wind ensemble. He was always in jeopardy of failing at least two classes and his only extracurricular was getting high with his friends. There was never any animosity between us, but there wasn’t any real sibling bond either. It sucked to hear what was happening (mainly how it affected my mom and dad) but I didn’t think I could really help any, and to be honest, I was more focused on school than anything else.

My parents tried to get Michael in to see professional help, but he refused. In fact, when they tried to push the issue, he left home for good. They had no idea where he went. They even filed a missing person report. Two months later they found him. He was living in some rundown old house out in the country, half an hour from the nearest paved road. No running water, no internet. The only power was from a pair of repurposed solar panels haphazardly mounted to the roof. Apparently, he bought the place and a small piece of land from some farmer nearby. Guess he still had a good chuck of his inheritance from our grandpa.

Of course, my parents tried to get him to come home, but again he refused. He said there were people watching him, following him. He didn’t even want people coming out to visit, since he was worried that they would lead whoever was trying to get him right to his doorstep. Even still, my dad went out to check on him every few days. For a while. Then he went every week. Then every couple weeks. Michael talked to him less and less every time he went out there. In the end, Dad said he only went out twice last year to check on him. Last time was almost a year ago. I think that part is really eating him up now.

So that’s the background. Onto the present. I’m in town for a week or so to help my parents sort things out. It’s the first time I’ve been back since high school. Once I finished college, I ended up getting married, then had a kid a year after that. Never was much time or reason to come back since my parents were more than happy to travel to us for visits. But with this all happening the way it did, I figured the least I could do was come help my mom and dad with the funeral arrangements and all of that. Funeral is set for next weekend, so that’s squared away. Michael didn’t have a will or anything, and as far as we can tell, the house, the land, and his truck are the only things he had left to his name. The police just finished up with the place a couple days ago, so I went out to take a look around.

When I say the place is remote, I’m really underselling it. There’s nothing to see for miles around aside from tall grass, low hills, and a single winding dirt road that runs roughly north to south. A barely defined driveway leads from that road another quarter mile east before it ends unceremoniously at a two-bedroom hovel with cracked plastic siding and a roof with maybe half the shingles still intact. By the time I pulled up, I could barely see the chipped blue paint of my sedan underneath the thick layer of dirt. There’s a hand-pump well out front and a leaning carport with a dusty red pickup truck wedged inside. And that’s it. The whole place gives me *Deliverance* vibes, it’s just missing the inbred kid with the banjo.

The place is even more depressing on the inside though. It barely feels lived in. Peeling wallpaper, cracked windows. The living room has a two-seater sofa, a broken lawn chair, and a coffee table. And that’s the most furnished room in the whole place. The first bedroom has a mattress on the floor with a nasty looking blanket balled up on top. The second bedroom has a couple boxes of Michael’s things that he apparently never even unpacked. The bathroom has the usual equipment (toilet, sink, shower, etc.) but nothing in any of the cabinets or drawers. And lastly, the kitchen is barren too aside from the standard appliances. No utensils or pans. Some beer, a couple canned vegetables, and two frozen dinners in the fridge are the only real signs anyone’s been here in the last year. As I was walking through the first time, I kept spooking myself. Thought I heard someone knocking on the door or opening the fridge.

They said they found him in the bedroom, leaned against the wall. Thankfully the clean-up crew did a decent enough job that you can’t really tell. If anything, that corner is far cleaner than the whole rest of the house now. Kinda morbid to think about. The whole place feels eerie. I’ve never been here before, and there’s barely any sign of Michael at all. And yet, I still feel something when I’m standing inside. Like I can feel some sort of connection being in the same place he did for the last part of his life. Something I never felt when we were growing up together, when he was still alive. Sounds stupid. Probably is stupid. Even so, it was enough for me to sit on the filthy couch for a bit and wait for the odd feeling to pass.

Mom asked me to bring all of Michael’s stuff back to their place so they can sort through it. I was worried I’d have to make multiple trips, but after seeing it all, I figured I probably wouldn’t even have to open my trunk. Unless she really wanted a ratty mattress or a lawn chair in two pieces. I brought the boxes from the spare bedroom out first, followed by the food from the fridge. Honestly should’ve just tossed that stuff in the trash, but whatever. As I was doing one last walkthrough of the place, I noticed something in the bedroom. Sticking out from under the mattress, I spied something bright red.

Upon closer inspection, I realized it was a spiral bound notebook, like the kind you have to bring for middle school. Pushing back the grungy old mattress, I find more of them. All different colors, some clearly more used, others still sealed in plastic. At least a dozen in total. I started piling them up and flipping through the ones that weren’t sealed. They were diaries. The dates go back to when I was still in college. It’s definitely Michael’s handwriting. He always had surprisingly good penmanship.

I flip through a couple of the older looking ones, but nothing immediately jumps out at me. Some strange passages that gave me déjà vu of the things Mom and Dad would describe on the phone. Paranoid type stuff, random diagrams that didn’t make any sense, a couple creepily detailed drawings of people and figures I didn’t recognize. I wondered why the police hadn’t taken them, but I don’t know how that whole process works. I guess if it was clear there wasn’t any foul play they wouldn’t really need to take “evidence.”

Intrigued, but not wanting to spend any more time in the house than I already had, I stacked all the journals up and brought them out to the car as well. After almost 45 minutes, I was finally back on the highway heading towards town. I had initially planned on bringing the stuff straight to my parents’ house, but as I was driving, I started to have second thoughts. The most recent diary’s first entry was dated only about a year ago. I didn’t see how it ended. I was worried it might be graphic, or it might have some sort of “goodbye” message.

My mom’s been a mess since one of the neighboring farmers found Michael. Since she first got the call from the police. If these diaries contained something particularly heavy, I didn’t want to just toss them in my mom’s lap and let her have at it. At the very least, I felt like I should have an idea of what to expect. So instead of driving to their place, I headed back to my hotel. I called them and told them I had the stuff and would be by in the morning. I left out the notebooks for the time being.

Which brings us to now. It’s almost 3 in the morning here. I just finished reading through Michael’s last diary. And now I’m typing it up. There’s a knot in my stomach. I should just go to sleep. But I can’t. I think I’m just trying to make sense of it still. Reading it through once left me with a funny feeling I can’t shake. Maybe someone on here will have more luck wrapping their head around it. Sorry, I know this kind of thing isn’t normally allowed. But maybe just going through it one more time myself will offer some clarity. I don’t know. Just read it for yourself.

Below is Michael’s last journal. I will note any of my own thoughts in \[brackets\] if I think they’re necessary.

>***7/11/2024***

>*Dad just left. Wish he would stay away. It’s not safe. They always show up when people come by. Car didn’t look like dad’s when it pulled up. Checked when he left and it was his again.*

>***7/12/2024***

>*Haven’t seen any outside for a few days now. I think I finally scared them off. Hopefully can make it to the store soon, running low on food.*

>***7/13/2024***

>*Need to ask Paul if he needs any more work done on his combine. Paid enough last time for two months of food. Will get more rice, less meat. Rice goes farther.*

>***7/15/2024***

>*Spoke too soon. Saw one of them again when I got back from the store. Ran off into the grass before I could get close. Wish I still had my gun. At least I got enough food to stay inside for a while.*

>***7/16/2024***

>*Getting bolder. One was banging on the wall last night. Three knocks, four times. Twelve knocks.*

>***7/17/2024***

>*Quiet again. I made some food and turned the lights on. I don’t want to let them dictate how I live my life. I’m not afraid of them. They know more than I do, but I know something they never will.*

>***7/20/2024***

>*I’m pretty good at cooking rice.*

>***7/25/2024***

>*Over a week with no sign. New record.*

>***7/26/2024***

>*Sometimes I still miss having a TV. I used to watch the late night shows I wasn’t supposed to. Grayson would always tell on me. But TVs are too dangerous. You watch them while they watch you.*

>***7/27/2024***

>*They were inside the house last night. All the beer is gone. Empty can of corn on the ground. Maybe they’ve been inside for a while.*

>***7/28/2024***

>*Toilet flushed while I was sleeping. Gone by the time I got to the bathroom. I’m not safe here anymore. I never was.*

>***7/31/2024***

>*Every night, more sounds. Heard a shattering sound a bit ago, but can’t find anything broken. I got lost on the way to the kitchen.*

>***8/1/2024***

>*Saw a cat in a dream. Reminded me of Ringo, but he was only ever a kitten. Ran away. Mom said he found a new family.*

>***8/3/2024***

>*Got lost again. Opened the door to the bathroom but ended up back at my bed. Tried again and it worked right. Heard voices. Slept in the tub.*

>***8/4/2024***

>*Multiple voices from my room. Camera shutters. A terrible smell. Not leaving the bathroom, but getting hungry.*

>***8/7/2024***

>*Took two days to find the kitchen. Had to go through the closet door in the spare room. The door knob felt loose.*

>***8/28/2024***

>*Haven’t left the kitchen for the last couple weeks. I’ve tried. At least there’s food. Hearing the knocking again. Three knocks, four times. Twelve knocks.*

>***9/7/2024***

>*The front door doesn’t work anymore. It won’t open. Paul was outside but he couldn’t hear me.*

>***9/21/2024***

>*I tried to break one of the windows. It shattered, but when I looked away it was fixed again. Cut my arms up pretty good.*

>***9/22/2024***

>*I keep hearing the people in my room. The ones with the terrible smell. I took my notebooks with me so they can’t read them. My hands aren’t cut anymore.*

>***10/1/2024***

>*I got outside. Through the cabinet under the sink. But one of them drove up in my truck. I had to run into the field. Ended up in my closet. Tried the sink cabinet again, but it only led back to itself.*

>***10/31/2024***

>*Happy Halloween*

>***11/8/2024***

>*Food should be gone by now. Some days it is. Some days there’s food I never bought. When I find the kitchen, I stay for a few days. Ate some corn and drank three beers. All that was left. There will be more next time. Maybe.*

>***11/9/2024***

>*The knocking lasts for days. Three knocks, four times. Twelve knocks.*

>***11/2024***

>*Watch died. Not enough sun through windows. Can’t tell days anymore. My arms are cut and bleeding again.*

>***???***

>*Tried to break through the walls. Now I’m stuck. Can barely see.*

>***???***

>*\[Lots of unintelligible scribbling and tally marks on this page.\]*

>***???***

>***???***

>*One two three. Four five six. Seven eight nine. Ten eleven twelve.*

>***???***

>\[There is a crude drawing of a black and white cat.\]

That was the last entry. Nothing but blank pages after. I never knew Michael had gotten this bad. I should have known. I should have listened. But it’s all too late now. I’ve considered reading more of the diaries, but I don’t think it will help. If they’re all like this, I don’t know if I can make it through them. Reading this through a second time and typing it down, it only made that funny feeling I felt in his house even stronger. Like a nauseating nostalgia for something I don’t even remember. I’m glad I got all his stuff when I went earlier, because I sure as hell don’t have any plans of going back.

Guess I should get some sleep, I’m rambling at this point. Sorry for wasting everyone’s time, but I guess this helped at least a little to get it on (digital) paper. I don’t normally partake in the hotel mini-bars, but tonight seemed like as worthy an occasion as any. Nothing like some cheap liquor on the rocks out of a disposable plastic cup for a nightcap. A toast to my late brother, I suppose.

1mcyish,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPastas/comments/1mcyish/bad_mouse/,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read “I have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse”. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.

They all had titles hastily scribbled on, “Bad Mouse: Episode 1”, “Bad Mouse: Episode 2”, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading “This is the last”. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be “Bad Mouse”, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.

All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.

Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the “show”, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone’s pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.

That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading “From me to you, Bad Mouse”, the “I have something I love” being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.

The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.

“Bad Mouse is getting desperate!” a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.

Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words “Bad Mouse” arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse’s depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.

Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments…just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words “Getting desperate”, but only in syllables:

”Get…ting…des…per…ate”.

The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.

No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over…and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network’s channels were all hijacked.

By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.

The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.

Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.

""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.

The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.

Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children’s channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.

Others had…darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today’s world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.

Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.

By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.

How very wrong those people were.

For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived…

There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.

Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:

“i’m here”’

“is it getting desperate?”

“i hate you all”

“i have to get attention”

“i’m desperate!”

“you love me, but I don’t love you”

“bad mouse is getting desperate!”

“i’m going to show you the world”

“bad mouse is getting worse!”

“me me me me me me”

“attention”

Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be “death day”. Everyone’s blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone’s horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.

Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.

By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children’s networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel’s executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.

On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children’s shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.

In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.”

The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.

A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.

All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.

The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.

As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on “a little something” to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.

But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.

No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.

All we know is that a disturbed and depraved mind exists somewhere in the world, and for that, the world is an ever scarier and darker place.

Essential Considerations When Selecting Barndominium Designs and Layouts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building a barndominium can be an exciting adventure. It offers a unique blend of rustic charm and modern living. However, selecting the right designs and layouts is crucial to achieving your dream space. Here are several essential considerations to ensure your barndominium serves your needs and exceeds your expectations.

### 1. Understand Your Needs

Before diving into designs, take some time to consider what you truly need in your barndominium. Ask yourself these questions:

- How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need?
- What type of living space do you envision?
- Do you want an open floor plan or separated areas?
- How much storage will you require?

Your answers will guide your design choices effectively.

### 2. Evaluate Your Space

The size and layout of your land significantly impact your barndominium's design. Consider the following:

- The total area available for construction.
- The shape and slope of the land.
- Access to utilities and roads.
- Natural features you want to incorporate, like views or trees.

Understanding these factors can help you select a layout that harmonizes with the landscape.

### 3. Design Style Matters

Barndominiums can be styled in numerous ways, from modern to traditional. Determine which aesthetic resonates with you the most. Here are a few popular styles:

- Rustic: Utilizes natural wood and stone for a cozy feel.
- Modern: Features sleek lines and open spaces.
- Industrial: Incorporates metal and unfinished elements for an edgy look.

Selecting a design style will streamline your choices and make the building process more enjoyable.

### 4. Plans for Future Needs

When selecting your layout, think long-term. Will your family grow? Would you like to host gatherings? Consider your future needs by evaluating:

- Expandable floor plans that can accommodate additions.
- Layouts that allow for multifunctional spaces.
- Outdoor areas for entertainment.

Planning for the future ensures your barndominium grows with you.

### 5. Budget Considerations

Your budget plays a vital role in determining your design choices. List all potential expenses, including:

- Materials and labor.
- Permits and inspections.
- Landscaping and finishes.

We connected instantly and had a fun, light-hearted exchange. Toward the end of the call, I jokingly said, “Let’s meet sometime for a coffee.” She paused for a moment and replied, “I’ll tell you something.”

“What is it?” I asked.
She said, “I’m blind by birth.”

For a moment, I couldn’t speak. My heart skipped a beat. I had never interacted with someone who was visually impaired, and I didn’t know how to respond. But then, she asked me, “Still want to meet?”

Without hesitation, I said, “Of course. I’m curious to know how you navigate your world—how you train your mind to direct you. Let’s meet next Sunday.”

We agreed to meet outside the metro station near the post office.

The day came. Yesterday. She texted, “Are you coming?” I told her I’d confirm by 6 p.m. depending on how my work went.

By 5:30 p.m., I had completed all my office tasks. I thought, I’ll leave now and call her at 6. But then, something strange happened. My body suddenly felt sick and weak—I could barely walk. I was exhausted, dizzy, and overwhelmed with anxiety. It felt like something was pulling me back, as if the universe was giving me a sign.

Still, I pushed myself. I reached the metro station, completely drained, but I kept going.

At Gate No. 6, she called, saying, “I’m here.” I froze for a moment. I looked around and saw her—standing there, with a man nearby yelling on the phone. She was blind.

I paused. My mind screamed, Run!
People were staring at her with pity, with judgment, and I could feel my fear rising. What if people stare at us? What will they think? My body wanted to escape.

But then, I remembered: You gave her your word.
I turned off airplane mode and approached her. “Ma’am, can I help you?
She said, “Someone is coming.
I was just 10 meters away. I took a deep breath, walked over, and said, “Hi.” She extended her hand, and we shook hands. I managed to calm my nerves, and we began talking.

It wasn’t as difficult as I had imagined. We had a smooth conversation—in English, even though it’s not our native language. We shared tea, talked about life, and smiled.

Before she left, I helped her into a rickshaw and paid the driver. She was smiling—truly happy. I noticed how sharp her mind was, how observant and lively she seemed. Though I was nervous at first, I started feeling comfortable around her. She asked me a final question before leaving:
“How did you feel after meeting me?”

It was a tough question, but I answered honestly: “I feel good. I feel changed.”

This story may seem small, but to me, it was profound. It made me reflect on how we treat people who look or live differently than we do. It shook something inside me. I still don’t know what you’ll think about me after reading this—but I just wanted to share the truth.

Thank you for reading this till the end. Time is the most precious gift you can offer someone, and I’m truly grateful you gave me yours.",4,1753854118.0,Life,7,1.0,False

1mcygaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryshortstories/comments/1mcygaz/bad_mouse/,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read “I have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse”. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.

They all had titles hastily scribbled on, “Bad Mouse: Episode 1”, “Bad Mouse: Episode 2”, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading “This is the last”. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be “Bad Mouse”, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.

All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.

Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the “show”, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone’s pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.

That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading “From me to you, Bad Mouse”, the “I have something I love” being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.

The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.

“Bad Mouse is getting desperate!” a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.

Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words “Bad Mouse” arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse’s depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.

Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments…just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words “Getting desperate”, but only in syllables:

”Get…ting…des…per…ate”.

The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.

No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over…and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network’s channels were all hijacked.

By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.

The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.

Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.

""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.

The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.

Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children’s channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.

Others had…darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today’s world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.

Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.

By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.

How very wrong those people were.

For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived…

There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.

Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:

“i’m here”’

“is it getting desperate?”

“i hate you all”

“i have to get attention”

“i’m desperate!”

“you love me, but I don’t love you”

“bad mouse is getting desperate!”

“i’m going to show you the world”

“bad mouse is getting worse!”

“me me me me me me”

“attention”

Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be “death day”. Everyone’s blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone’s horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.

Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.

By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children’s networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel’s executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.

On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children’s shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.

In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.”

The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.

A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.

All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.

The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.

As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on “a little something” to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.

But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.

No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.

All we know is that a disturbed and depraved mind exists somewhere in the world, and for that, the world is an ever scarier and darker place.

Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived…

There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.

Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:

“i’m here”’

“is it getting desperate?”

“i hate you all”

“i have to get attention”

“i’m desperate!”

“you love me, but I don’t love you”

“bad mouse is getting desperate!”

“i’m going to show you the world”

“bad mouse is getting worse!”

“me me me me me me”

“attention”

Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be “death day”. Everyone’s blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone’s horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.

Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.

By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children’s networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel’s executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.

On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children’s shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.

In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.”

The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.

A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.

All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.

The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.

As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on “a little something” to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.

But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.

No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.

All we know is that a disturbed and depraved mind exists somewhere in the world, and for that, the world is an ever scarier and darker place.",2,1753853851.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1mcyeax,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1mcyeax/bad_mouse/,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read “I have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse”. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.

They all had titles hastily scribbled on, “Bad Mouse: Episode 1”, “Bad Mouse: Episode 2”, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading “This is the last”. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be “Bad Mouse”, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.

All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.

Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the “show”, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone’s pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.

That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading “From me to you, Bad Mouse”, the “I have something I love” being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.

The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.

“Bad Mouse is getting desperate!” a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.

Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words “Bad Mouse” arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse’s depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.

Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments…just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words “Getting desperate”, but only in syllables:

”Get…ting…des…per…ate”.

The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.

No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over…and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network’s channels were all hijacked.

By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.

The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.

Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.

""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.

The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.

Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children’s channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.

Others had…darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today’s world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.

Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.

By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.

How very wrong those people were.

For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening.

I rented a storage unit for $30/month and moved everything there except for one plate, one bowl, one cup and one set of silverware that I kept in my room.

When he got back he texted me asking where all the dishes went. I told him they were ""being cleaned"" and he'd get them back when he proved he could keep up with washing one set of dishes for a month.

He's been eating off paper plates and drinking from red solo cups for two weeks now. Yesterday he finally cracked and deep cleaned the entire kitchen trying to prove he's changed.

I changed seats to the other end of the cafe but still could hear them over the music from my headphones and the barista music. 
Needless to say I did not get much work done because I was pissed the whole time. Urghhhh

Edit: For people saying I should have gone to a library. I did not need a quiet place. I already had music on to cancel out the outside noise.

[Sage/Breville Oracle],"I recently purchased a 2nd hand Breville Oracle from facebook marketplace and cannot get my shots right at all.. My shots are always sour and underextracted no matter what i try.. I've gone through 3kg of beens already and no solution.

I've got my shot to a 1:2 ratio as a starting point - Sour  
I've tried fining up the grounds - Sour  
I've tried a greater yield - Sour  
I've tried raising the temp - Sour  
Longer shot time - Sour  
Increasing pre infuse time - Sour

I did discover that the inner shower screen was cracked and thought that was the cause of the under extraction, however, I have replaced that and the gasket but still getting the same issue.

I also notice that it seems I have to grind a lot coarser than I usually see on videos to get to a 1:2 ratio. Around the 40+ mark. (Inner burr setting is set to 6.)

I have noticed my portafilter is noticeably tighter now due to the new shower head and gasket and the grounds are noticeably closer to the shower screen (Sometimes leaving shower screen imprint in the ground coffee after extraction). Could this cause some issues?

Given that this is an older machine, is there anything else I could check to see that the machine is operating effectively? I feel like i've tried everything and it has to be the machines fault at this point haha.

I'm using Lazzio Medium roast beans from Aldi for reference. I thought maybe because they listed fruity notes I could be mistaking that flavour for sourness but I changed to the Lazzio Brazil beans which don't have that note and still the same sourness.

Our first couple dates were short (coffee and lunch) but we had longer ones since then.  After date 3, I had asked what she wanted in a relationship.  She mentioned to me that she wanted to “take things slow,” which I respected and obliged to.  

We managed another few dates and I was starting to fall for her.  I thought we had great conversations and fun times when we were together.  I felt like I was getting her out of her shell since I knew she was being cautious because of her divorce.  I wanted to ask her where the relationship was going and I wanted to see if she was interested in taking things further after date 6, but I didn’t want to overstep her boundaries of taking it slow.  

Our latest meetup, we had a chat and she said she couldn’t see me anymore because someone else (a previous friend, by what she said) asked her to be his girlfriend.  I was disappointed because that was supposed to be the night I was going to ask her myself.  She told me that if I were to have asked her to be together, even if it was a couple days ago, she would have said yes to me; but since I decided to respect her decision to take it slow, I’m out a girl that I really like.

You know that good ol’ grindset everyone raves about? The endless hustle that promises you'll be 1% better every day? Sure, that sounds charming on a coffee mug, but let’s break it down—are we really winning, or are we just fueling our burnout fires like it's cozy and warm?

Here’s a little story. A while back, I was chasing that “1% better” lifestyle like it was the last slice of pizza at a party. I was grinding from dawn till dusk, pushing through fatigue like it was a game. But guess what happened? I crashed harder than a bad Wi-Fi connection during a Zoom call. 💥 

So here's the kicker: What if **striving for relentless improvement is actually draining your passion** instead of fueling it? 

Think about these points:

- **The Slow Burn:** Constantly chasing that 1% can feel inspiring, but it’s like adding a log to a fire that’s already too hot. You might catch a spark (cha-ching!), but you’re also just feeding the flames of stress. 🔥 
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Imagine running a marathon but cramming for it by sprinting every day. You’ll get tired REAL quick. Nothing wrong with pacing yourself and embracing slow, incremental growth—after all, the tortoise won the race, right? 🐢💪
- **Mindfulness Matters:** Remember to *take a breath* amidst the grind. Meditation, journaling, or even a stroll outside can break the cycle of pressure we put on ourselves. Just because everyone else is grinding doesn’t mean you have to. How about a little “you” time? ✌️
- **Rethink Success:** If you feel burnt out, maybe it’s time to redefine what being ""successful"" looks like for you. Is it more tasks checked off your to-do list or being fulfilled in what you do? Spoiler alert: it’s usually the latter. 🌈 

Let’s not forget that we’re human—*not machines*. We’re allowed to rest, recharge, and even binge-watch that new Netflix series. (Anyone else watch “Squid Game” way too late last night? 😅)

At the end of the day, high performance doesn't have to mean *high pressure*. Rather than chasing perfection, how about we aim for consistency? Maybe give yourself a break and celebrate what you’ve accomplished, no matter how small it seems.

So, what’s on your mind? Are you feeling the grind, or maybe you’ve found a way to balance it all and keep your sanity? Let’s keep this convo flowing! 💬",1,1753852460.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

**So, here’s what you do:**

1. **Find a comfy spot**: First step, no rocket science here. Just plant yourself somewhere peaceful. Your desk, the couch, Hogwarts—whatever. 🧙‍♂️

2. **Close your eyes**: Not just for napping, you know. This helps cut out all the distractions (sorry, TikTok).

3. **Deep breath in (through your nose!)**: Try for a nice, sloooow count to 4 seconds. Imagine you’re inhaling all the awesomeness (puppies, rainbows, you name it). 🐶🌈

4. **Hold it**: Got it? Hold... to the count of 4. **Feel** that air hanging out in your lungs, like it's chillin' on a mini-vacation. 🏖️

5. **Slowly exhale through your mouth**: Count to 6 seconds here. Let it all go, like those worries about what to cook for dinner. 🍝

6. **Repeat a few times**: And before you know it, you’re as cool as a cucumber in a freezer.

**Why it works?** This little magic act sneaks up on your nervous system, coaxing it from overdrive back to chill mode. Science calls this the *parasympathetic response*, but we call it ""Ahhhh, much better.""

It makes zero sense that coffee folks turn their noses up at the exact same kind of boldness. not everything needs to be single origin either, blends, especially for espresso, slap hard. and if you haven’t had an arabica/robusta blend or something with indian robusta cherries… trust me, it’s worth a shot. they get plenty of love in the west for a reason.
honestly, just try stuff, talk to roasters, and ignore the snobbery. coffee is personal and what you enjoy actually matters way more than what’s trendy. so yeah, drink what actually makes you happy. you’re not doing it wrong if you prefer the rich, darker stuff you might just know what you like.

Serving quality coffee can completely elevate the experience of any event or shared space. Whether you're hosting a community gathering, managing a lobby area, or organizing a private celebration, offering fresh coffee with a coffee vending machine is a practical and impressive solution.

Instead of relying on expensive barista services or bulk-brewed coffee, coffee machine rental gives you the convenience of on-demand, café-style beverages without the hassle of ownership or maintenance.

# Why Rent a Coffee Machine?

Renting a modern coffee vending machine brings flexibility to your event or public setting. You can provide multiple drink options—like espresso, cappuccino, and hot chocolate—through a single, user-friendly system. These machines are designed to work efficiently in high-traffic environments.

Whether it's a local art show, office lobby, community center, or open house, a rented coffee machine adds hospitality and comfort without requiring full-time staff. The setup is easy, the operation is simple, and the service is professional.

# Ideal for Small Events and Shared Spaces

Many community managers, event organizers, and facility owners now choose commercial coffee vending machines to improve visitor satisfaction. These machines are compact yet powerful, making them perfect for:

* School and college events  
* Business meetings and conferences  
* Medical clinics and waiting rooms  
* Residential lounges and clubhouses  
* Fitness centers and wellness retreats  

Offering coffee in such spaces enhances the overall experience for guests, clients, or residents—making them feel welcome and valued.

# Renting vs. Buying: What’s Better?

While some may consider exploring options to buy coffee vending machine units, it often makes more sense to rent—especially for short-term needs or budget-conscious planning. Renting eliminates upfront costs and typically includes regular maintenance and servicing.

Of course, for permanent installations, searching for a coffee vending machine for sale may be a more sustainable option in the long run.

# Key Features of a Good Coffee Vending Solution

When selecting the best commercial coffee vending machine for your needs, look for models that offer:

* A variety of beverage options  
* Fast brewing and heating  
* Easy-to-use touch panels or buttons  
* Modern and space-efficient design  
* Reliable service and restocking support  

Today’s modern [coffee vending machine](https://musthavevending.com/coffee-services/) options combine performance with style, delivering quality coffee while enhancing the look of your space.

# Easy Setup, Lasting Impact

Coffee machine rentals are typically quick to install and operate. Most service providers handle delivery, setup, and technical support, making the process hassle-free. Guests can enjoy self-service coffee at any time, adding a warm and professional touch to your space or event.

Whether you're planning a networking event, community gathering, or simply want to improve your shared facility, renting a coffee machine can be a simple yet effective upgrade.

**Final Thoughts**

If you're looking to offer quality refreshments in an efficient and professional manner, renting a coffee vending machine is a smart and reliable choice. Whether for short-term events or ongoing service in public areas, it brings value, convenience, and a better experience for everyone involved.

“whats the timeline for moving on, there is none, but you need to unlearn and relearn, for that you need to venture and discover” they say.

I forgive you.

for what? maybe everything. 

who knows maybe in the future we will cross paths again,maybe id venture into our cafe saying that i miss the coffee secretly hoping to run into you. 

maybe if we do,and we lock eyes,nothing would have changed. maybe everything would have changed, so much so that i wouldn’t be able to recognise the person infront of me, and maybe i’ll walk out of there happy knowing that even though i may not recognise the new you anymore, that’s a good thing, because the version of you i fell in love with is only mine to know and keep.

who knows,maybe this text will find you, and if it does, know that i forgive you. And you’re just a boy, you need to live life a little easy. hope you get to a place where peace is not foreign to you. A place where you feel you belong. i tried to show you so many times but i’m realizing that that’s something you have to find on your own to truly believe it.

No good deed goes unpunished… no evil deed goes unappraised.

I speak now as a man who is defined by clarity. If I had been asked- referencing my definition- a few years ago, I would have hesitated, pondered, perhaps even zoned out in the ether of existentialism; eventually I would reply: Making my son happy.

If you asked me- once more referencing my definition- a few months ago; the words would practically fly from my lips like an uncaged crow: Survival. 

My son was killed by a drunk driver who- by taking my son- took a word from my vocabulary and mutilated it; violated it. Loved. I had to say I loved my son. I couldn’t wake up and look him in the blue marble eyes and smile and say: I love you. That word was taken from me by the last person I’d expect. 

His mother didn’t bother showing up to the funeral: “I don’t want to see my son like that, fucker!” translation: “I don’t have any clothes not stained with cum or soaked in crack smoke, fucker!” And other than me and my father-in-law, the pews were empty.

“Thank you for coming, Immanuel.” His hand was as soft as sandpaper but gentle.

“Of course, Kiddo. This isn’t something you face alone… Sasha not comin’?” His eyes kept mine open, kept them alert. I shook my head and he nodded his. It felt like his hand was glued to my back, keeping a constant, pleasant pressure on my shoulder. The service was short and despite paying for the lecture, I only had one person to eulogize to. 

“He never got to meet you. I’m sorry about that. Just everything with Sasha… I was so bitter. And I didn’t even know you existed till you just kinda… appeared while she was first showing… signs.”

“You don’t need to apologize. It’s not like I’ll never meet him. I’ll end up in the same garden he is. So will you.”

“I think I’m gonna be okay… I just need some time.”

“Well once you’re ready… I’ll call you.” I raised an eyebrow for a frame, but smiled crudely and nodded. I Ubered home- I suppose the driver was typically chatty, but picking up a tear stained man from a funeral house was a hint enough- and tipped the fella 15 bucks for the quality AC.

8 glasses of cinnamon pain killer were enough to get the tears to stop. As I went for a 9th, the first knock came. *Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap.* Through the peep hole I saw a lean white man with slick salt and pepper comb-over. He wore a black suit and tie. I opened the door, expecting a mormon and noticed he now wore glasses too. They were thin and circular. I must have missed them in my hasty once-over of him. I thought he looked better with them anyway so I didn’t pay it much mind. “Y– Yes?”

“Hey neighbor! I just moved in down the way, but the movers won’t have my stuff there till tomorrow. Could I borrow some lunch meat or something?”

“Um…” It was a weird question, but houses aren’t cheap, especially not in my area, so who am I to deny a man tight on cash. “Sure-”

“You look lost.” I was stunned for a moment. “Did you just move here too?” Relief escaped my lungs. My drunken gait was indifferent from a man lost in a new, too-big house. 

“No no… just a little… Little too many stiff ones.” I faked a chuckle and his chuckle followed, even faker than mine. It was oddly reassuring. He faked his laugh to make me feel better about faking mine. I smiled for the second time that day. “Do you wanna come in, get some coffee?”

He took two steps back and looked up at the sky with a sarcastic examination. “My dad always told me to play things safe, but where is the harm in living a little dangerously?” Now I actually chuckled and swung the door wide.

“Coffee at 6, you must be a Knievel.” He walked inside

“One, actually, but I prefer Lou.” And stayed for about 3 hours, sharing stories about his time serving as a missionary and pastor.

“It’s been a while, but Egypt was an oven! You simply cannot escape the heat. I can only imagine it’s worse now with global-warming and all.” *Sip.* “But, I was out there with a dozen of my guys trying to spread the ‘Oh-so-good word’ and help some of these people, but we-” He stifled laughter while he spoke. “We ended up getting chased out by some hippie in a damn curtain!” He practically screamed in laughter and I followed suit. “But, little did he know, I don’t get chased out that easily… Man, it’s getting late. I ought to head home– Thank you. Thank you for humoring an old fool.” He stood up and threw on his jacket.

“Of course. And thank *you,* I needed the laughter.”

“I always provide.” He bowed slightly and I chuffed. “You mind if I come around again, see how much more I can steal from ya?” he giggled and I wheezed.

“Come and take what you want anytime, friend.”

“Well I like your doors, so I’ll start there.” And once more I wheezed in a caffeinated-drunken gigglefit. He stuffed down his laughter and extended his hand for a shake. My hand rose, but was snatched back as my phone rang loudly. 

“Shoot–”

“No worries, get your call, bud. I’ll see ya later!”

I grit my teeth, embarrassed but nodded and waved, before shutting the door and rushing to my phone. “Immanuel?”

“Hey, Kiddo. I just wanted to check in on you.” The velvet gravel voice of Immanuel bucked in my ears and in my motion my stomach twisted to a knot. It felt years had passed since I thought of him- of anything other than booze, coffee, and conversation.

“I- I’m…” The world came back to me. “I’m… better. As *better* as I can be.”

“Good good. I was wondering, and you can say no, if you’d want to come to church with me Sunday?” 

“I- Uh… I don’t know if that’s where I belong. I don’t- I’m not-”

“I’m not asking you to. And, trust me when I say, you don’t need to. But it’ll help.”

I chewed on my cheek. “Alright. Where is it?”

“Don’t worry about that part, I’ll pick you up at 5:30am. Deal?”

“Deal.”

The next day, around 3pm, Lou: *Tap Tap Tap,* then cracked open my door and peered in. I craned my neck, cheeks slightly tear stained as I gripped a photo of my son in a Thomas the Tank engine costume me and him had DIY’d for Halloween.

“Hey, Bud… Bad time?”

“No no no… I’m just… thinkin’.”

“What an atrocious sin, oh how hell will punish you.” He cracked a meek smile. 

A humming chuckle rose in my throat but died there as well. He walked in, the suit was a dark shade of red today, nigh-black, and sat next to me on the couch after shutting the door softly. “Your kid?”

“Mhm. Elie. He’s 3 here and I swear he’s the cutest kid ever born.” My stomach dropped and fiery guilt swelled but swiftly died.

“I’d be hard pressed to disagree.”

“I uh, would work for days every October to help him choose what costume he wanted, Then we’d go get the materials and spend a week pouring our hearts into it- till it was perfect. Then he’d go out, and get maybe… 3 pounds candy. Guess how long that bucket would last?”

“2 days.”

“N– Yeah! Without fail! 2 days it’d empty and he’d say the same thing: ‘Never again dad, never again.’ I did everything to make him the happiest he could be. Make him know he was loved.” Gently, so gently I had at first thought the picture floated from my hands, Lou took the picture and stared at it with a distant glimmer in his eye.

“He’s in a better place now.”

Tears flowed again. “I hope so… If I had it my way, he’d be in his room right now, building some skyscraper with his magnet tiles. But, maybe he is. Just not here.” A rock grew in my throat and an opaque haze blurred my vision. “I’m sorry for… all this- can I get you coffee or a sandwich or something?”

“No no… I just wanted to swing by and say hi, I gotta unpack and’ll be at it all day.”

“I could help ya if you need?”

“No, I got a legion on payroll. After they get done doing all the grunt work, I’m gonna put on some blues and decorate till I’ve got no wall space left.”

“How far down the way are you?”

“You know the fork in the road, about a mile or two…” He conjured a mental map, “That way.” He gestured west. “The yellow one.”

“Oh… The manor house?! Wow… you’re *rich* rich.” 

“Yeah, she’s a nice place, no damned AC, but I’ve been through worse than heat.” He tapped the picture with his index finger then opened, and swiftly closed his mouth.

“What?”

“Oh nothing… I was just gonna ask… ask if I can keep this?” He looked queasily at me, embarrassed.

My lip pulled back behind my teeth, then relaxed. “Yeah… I got plenty.” 

He brightened. “Thank you!” He stood up and set his hand on my shoulder. “You were a good dad.”

“Thank y-” I barely remained intact. “Thank you.” And he left.

I went to bed that night with an alarm set for 4:00 so I could wake up, adjust, shower, dress, and get coffee made by 5:15 all to be ready by 5:30 for Immanuel. REM came quicker than usual and similarly, left quicker than typical. 

*Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap*

2:52am, the clock on my nightstand blared in red dashes. I sat up- floaty headed- and lurched towards the door out of my bedroom; sluggishly traveled down the hall, shambled down the stairs, and peeped through the peep hole. Lou stood facing away from the door in a maroon suit. I swung it open and was met with his smile, he had been facing the door; hadn’t he.

“Lou?” I grunted.

“Moses! I’m glad you’re up. May I come in?”

I hesitated, confused. “Ye- yeah, of course.” As he entered, I spotted that he held the picture of Elie in his hand. 

“I need to talk to you, my friend. Sit.”

“What’s up?” I said, more awake now.

“What I’m about to say… it’s gonna sound weird.”

“What?”

He rolled his tongue along his lips.”You’re son. How did he die?”

“Wha-”

“How did he die?”

“Don’t ask me tha-”

“Moses.” His face lost all luster and kindness.

“When the car… spun out: the back passenger seat slammed in a pole and… he was– Why are you asking me this!?”

Lou answered swiftly. “Who was the drunk driver that day?”

“No… please no.”

“Who?”

I began to weep. “Me… I had gotten… and I thought I could manage… but the rain… I lost control.” Lou dove to my feet, his hands cupping my face and directing my eyes towards his.

“Shush, shush… it’s okay, it’s okay. Look at me. I know the pain you feel. All too well. And- and… can help you. I can bring him back.”

“Wh-”

“I’ve done it before, brought people back from the other side. Myself a time. You can see Elie again. Have Elie again. all yours, like before.”

“How– No, no! It’s not right.”

“It’s perfectly right, because it’s what you want. Here.” His index finger tapped my heart. “I know, because I know it all.”

“How?”

“You just have to ask.”

“That’s… That’s it?” Lou nodded. My lips trembled and my body quaked. “Can you bring my son back?”

“Yes.” His hand rose, and so did mine. It glided forward then recoiled as my phone rang up the stairs. I turned to face Lou and he shrugged. “Now or never.” Without a thought, my hand swam forward, and shook his. “Congrats my friend. All things are how they should be.” My racing heart eased its pace and we both smiled. “Better go get that call.” He chuffed.

I dashed up the stairs, all hope and joy and passion reignited. Love came back to vocabulary. I raised the phone to my ear. “Hello?” I chirped.

“Why did you shake his hand?” Immanuel sobbed.

“What? Immanuel- what’s wrong?”

“I told you we’d see him in the garden someday. Did you want it that bad? Was it worth your soul?”

“What?”

“You could have saved yourself… I made you to be wise… how could you think so little?” And the call ended.

“Moses… He’s back.” He shouted. *Lou* shouted. Lou One. Low One. I dashed downstairs, tripping halfway down and riding my spine to the ground. I scrambled up and panned my gaze to Lou. Elie stood beside him, eyes wet with tears. “Say: Hi, Elie.”

“No!” I wailed, cascading to my knees.

“Yes…” I fell to my side and wept against the planks. “Get up Moses. You don’t have much time.” I clambered to my knees and crawled into the living room.

“Elie.” I sniffled.

“Dad?” Elie murmured. “Are you okay?”

“No…” I broke down again. 

“Moses… Look at me.” He knelt to my side and pulled me to my knees. “You have 10 minutes. Heaven will only let him be out here for 10. Short. Minutes. Mo. You already paid, no point in crying. Spend this well okay?” His voice was new. It was slicker and polished. It was soft. It was kind. He removed his pocket square and cleaned off my face of the water works. 

I shuddered toward Elie who smiled now that my complexion was less glum. “How are you, Buckshot?”

“Good, Dad! I've been at this pretty garden with Immanuel. There are all these fruits that I didn’t even know existed!” His smile was as bright as the day I lost him. His voice as innocent and curious as everyday he’d woken up. 

“That’s amazing…” We talked for what felt like an eternity with an end. Each minute felt like some grand and critical part of the world was falling away, but also: that it was used to its fullest before its loss. He told me of relatives he met and friends he had made. He spoke of the food and the music. The wings in the sky. 

“I can’t wait for you to see it, Dad.” Some part of me knew, but a glance to Lou confirmed it. 

“It’ll be a while before I do… But, I’m sure the wait will be worth it.” I held my son as the last lie I’d ever tell him fell away from my mouth. His warmth grew then dulled. Lou walked to my side, Elie’s soft skin becoming gritty as whatever he was made of turned to dust on the furniture.

It broke back out, tears cleaning and dragging away spots of the dust. “I’m sorry Mo. I really am.”

“You’re a fucking liar.”

“The worst part is: I can’t be… I’m not allowed to not do… this to people. Most of the time, I enjoy it. I get to look evil souls in the face as they come to understand. But, cases like these… I wish I didn’t have to.”

“What do you mean?”

“I wish you could know.” His cheeks became wet. “I’m so sorry, I was begging you’d say no… Goodbye, Mo. I’m moving today.” And he left. 

Clarity fills me now. Of definitions I’ve given myself, this one is- unironically- the clearest. I have been given a profound understanding of how many things are watching everything you do. How many things cheer and jeer. How little they lie. That’s the part that still hurts. More than any other. 

Demons lie, and they fail because of it. But, the Devil will give you nothing but the truth, and that's why he will always get you. They call him the king of lies, but not once, not with me or any other human past, present, or future; has he ever lied. 

He smiles, dresses well. Smells of honey and speaks so compassionately. He’s gentle and kind- so, so, so kind. His face is never the same, but it’s always only his. He will look like you least expect, but most enjoy. He will ask for little things, and soon he’ll ask for everything; and you’ll give it to him. 

You only have one hope. If you hear a knock (3 taps, 3 times) on your door and  the man on the other side of the door is dressed in a deep red suit that could almost be mistaken as black, don't answer. Just pray and unlock the door. Because if he is at yours, you deserve whatever is coming.",4,1753851783.0,nosleep,0,0.84,False

Kicked off the morning with a fresh VI-JOHN Super Platinum blade – and boy, no disappointments here.

In the past, I’ve stretched this blade up to 5-6 good shaves, but with Slant, I might be looking at a solid 3 at best.

Also tried out Pearl Coffee OP ☕. I was hoping for a bold, real coffee vibe — more roasted bean. Instead, it leaned toward a cozy café scent, with a slightly synthetic note. That said, it still did a solid job of making the room smell like a fresh brew.

I swear, I see people everywhere holding Starbucks or Amazon or Best Buy cards like they’re just growing in wild orchards, and I’m like… where’s my free tree?? 😅 Is there some VIP club that sends them in mysterious black envelopes, or are these people just wizards??

Here’s what I *think* I know, but seriously, help me out if you’ve cracked the code:

- **Surveys and Rewards Apps!** You know those apps that claim, “Download me! Take a 3-minute survey and get a $10 gift card!”? I tried like two because, honestly, who can resist. Then after 90 minutes I had… exactly… *forty* points, and you need like, 14,000 for a $5 Amazon card. Whyyy?

- **Bank or Credit Card Bonuses.** Sometimes, if you open an account or spend a certain amount in 3 weeks, banks just toss some digital cards at you. Are they hoping you overspend? Or do I need to be a secret math genius to figure out the best deal??

- **WHEE! Loyalty Programs!** This one is obvious, right? Except somehow I’m always a few points short on every coffee app. I’m not made of beans, Bridget. But maybe you are? What’s your hack?

Okay, but this is where I get extra confused:  
Gift card sweepstakes. Are these EVEN REAL?
Do people actually win??
I signed up for a 'spin the wheel' on like https://goodnovel.org/ and so far all I’ve gotten is a blinking unicorn…  
If you’ve won from a sweepstakes or an “instant win” thing, let me live vicariously and tell me *everything*.

Another place I see: promos on https://goodnovel.org/ (seriously, check it out cause their pop ups are low-key insistent).  
Is it a trick? Or do I just have to buy a ton before they reward me? Someone, drop your spreadsheet of secrets.  

My questions to YOU:
- Has a cashier ever just handed you a gift card for being charming/at the right place right time? (True stories please! I want to believe lol)
- How do you *really* use sites like https://goodnovel.org/ for cards? Is it codes, contests, or just crossing fingers and clicking?
- Any shady “hacks” I should avoid that will turn me into an internet ghost?

Lastly, if you have some ritual (full moon, odd socks, blinking unicorns welcome) that gets you those magical plastic rectangles, THIS IS THE PLACE TO CONFESS.  

Bring the wisdom. Bring the receipts 🤑  
And please, if you actually have methods that actually work, you will be singlehandedly saving my next birthday.

1mcxp8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mcxp8d/my_son_wanted_a_clown_for_his_birthday_what_came/,My Son Wanted a Clown for His Birthday. What Came Wasn’t Human.,"I wouldn’t say I’m the best of dads, but I try. I really do. Especially for my children… especially for my son. He looks up to me like I hung the stars. It scares me sometimes; how much he watches me. How much he mirrors me.

My own upbringing wasn’t exactly ideal. My father was... absent, mostly. In and out. Never in one place long enough to matter. Never involved enough to remember birthdays or bedtime stories. I spent most of my childhood waiting for a man who never really showed up.

Now, I run a successful PR firm. Big clients. Big contracts. Big house in the suburbs. Picture-perfect wife. Beautiful kids. A life that looks polished from the outside. Shiny. Clean.

But the cracks are there.

A couple of days ago, my wife leaned in from across the kitchen island and said casually, “Your son’s birthday is tomorrow. Have you thought about any entertainment yet?”

It was like a cold wind slipped down my spine.

“Oh heck... I haven’t, honey. I completely forgot.”

She didn’t answer at first. Just gave me that look. The kind of look that says more than words ever could. Then she turned and muttered, almost to herself, “Am I the only present parent?”

The guilt sank in immediately. Heavy. Familiar.

His birthday… was tomorrow.

That’s when it hit me, hard. I was becoming my father. That same drifting shadow. The one thing I swore I’d never be.

So, I left for work, phone in hand, frantically googling last-minute clowns, magicians—anything. But everything was booked. Solid. No one was free.

Really? *All* of them?

Were clowns seriously that in demand?

I parked my car in the driveway and just sat there for a minute, the engine ticking as it cooled. My fingers gripped the steering wheel. I needed to fix this. Today. No more putting things off like my old man. My son deserved better.

By the time I reached the office, the elevator smelled like burnt coffee and that lemon-scented floor cleaner the janitors used. I barely noticed. My *mind was buzzing*….party hats, cakes, clown rentals, balloon animals. I had to line something up.

The elevator dinged on my floor. Just before I stepped out, Mark slipped in, coffee in one hand, tablet in the other.

“Hey, man,” he said, raising his brows. “You look like hell. Everything okay?”

“It’s Liam’s birthday tomorrow,” I muttered. “Completely forgot to book entertainment. No clown. No nothing. I’m scrambling.”

Mark chuckled, slapping my shoulder. “Classic dad move. So what are we thinking; pony rides? Fire breathers? Or do we just roll out the ol’ iPad and hope for the best?”

“Come on, man. I’m serious. Know anyone?”

He shook his head, grinning. “I’ve got two left feet and crippling social anxiety. You don’t want me around kids. Sorry, can’t help you.”

“Useless,” I said with a smirk as we stepped off. “You’re lucky your daughter likes you.”

“Yeah, yeah. Good luck finding a clown on 24 hours’ notice.” He peeled off toward his own office.

I sat in mine for about an hour, shuffling through emails and going through the motions, but my brain wasn’t there. My phone’s search history had become a desperate list of terms like *last-minute birthday clown*, *kids party magician now*, *PR dad failure*. Nothing new. Nothing available.

I had a client meeting downstairs just before noon. Same building, just one floor down in the glass conference room. On my way back, my head buried in my notes, I bumped into someone.

“Oh….*sorry, man*,” I said, backing up quickly.

The janitor looked up at me. Old guy. Pale skin. Blue coveralls. He had one of those rubber gloves half-hanging out of his back pocket and a mop handle resting lightly against the wall.

“Birthday party?” he said suddenly.

I blinked. “Uh… sorry?”

“For your son,” he said, a slow grin creeping across his face. “You’re looking for a clown, right?”

Something inside me froze. “How did you…?”

He pointed upward with a greasy thumb. “Heard you and your buddy talking. Thin walls in that elevator.”

“Oh,” I said. “Right. Yeah. You wouldn’t happen to…..?”

“I know just the guy,” he interrupted. That grin of his stayed in place. Wide. Wrong. “Old-school type. Real classic. Kids love him. Always available, too.”

Before I could say anything else, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, crumpled card. It wasn’t even laminated. Just a torn piece of yellow paper with a number written in sharp red ink.

No name. No logo. Just the digits.

He placed it in my hand like it was fragile.

“Give him a call,” he said. “He never disappoints.”

“Thanks,” I said, still caught off guard. “You…uh….you work here long? I don’t think I’ve seen you around.”

But he was already walking away, mop in hand, disappearing around the corner.

I stood there for a moment, watching the empty hallway, the card still in my hand. I should’ve asked his name. Maybe I should’ve been more polite. I worked in PR, after all….keeping track of people is part of the job.

Still… something about him felt off. Like a face you only see once in a dream and never forget.

But I had a number now. Maybe a solution. And if this guy came through, well... maybe I owed the creepy janitor a beer.

Or a raise.

I wrapped up at the office just as the sky started turning orange, the end-of-day glow stretching across the city like it was holding its breath. I didn’t waste any time. Drove straight to the biggest toy store in town and loaded a cart with everything that screamed ""guilt money."" Remote control cars, action figures, a Lego set big enough to bankrupt me twice. I didn’t even check prices. I just grabbed what looked shiny and loud and fun.

Part of me still didn’t want to call that clown.

The janitor’s words rang in my mind the entire time I stood in the checkout line.  
*""He never disappoints.""*

That smile. That **teeth-too-many** kind of smile.

I kept the card tucked in my wallet like it might poison me through the fabric.

He was my last resort. A backup plan for a promise I should’ve made weeks ago.

By the time I got home, it was dark. The porch light flickered once as I turned the key. Inside, the scent of cinnamon and fabric softener hit me like a hug. Home.

I barely had time to put the gifts down before Liam ran up the hallway in his rocket pajamas, arms wide open.

“Daaaad!” he shouted, slamming into me with full six-year-old force. “Is the clown coming tomorrow?!”

I knelt and wrapped my arms around him, feeling his excitement pulsing through every hug and every bounce of his little feet.

“Hey, champ!” I ruffled his hair. “That’s a surprise. You’ll just have to wait and see, alright?”

He grinned, eyes sparkling.

“You should be in bed right now,” I added with mock sternness. “It’s way past your bedtime, okay?”

“Okay, Dad!” he chirped, already half-turning down the hallway.

He didn’t even wait for a goodnight kiss. Just zipped back to his room like he’d explode if he didn’t fall asleep fast enough to get to tomorrow.

I stood there in the foyer a moment longer, the Superman-wrapped presents glinting under the ceiling light.

As I was laying the last of the Superman-wrapped gifts near the living room table, I heard her footsteps.

My wife came around the corner, tired eyes, hair tied up, hoodie hanging off one shoulder. She kissed me on the cheek more habit than affection and asked quietly, “Did you get the clown?”

I looked away.

“Everything’s booked,” I muttered. “I don’t know what to do.”

She sighed. That kind of sigh that makes your stomach twist before the words even hit.

“You had *weeks*, Michael,” she said, arms crossed. “Weeks to figure this out. It’s like you *want* to disappoint him.”

“That’s not fair,” I replied, half-heartedly.

“No?” she snapped. “Then what would you call forgetting his birthday entertainment until the *night before*? You think buying him a stack of toys makes up for that?”

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. She was right.

She shook her head slowly. “You promised me you’d do better. That you wouldn’t turn into your father.”

That one hit harder than I expected.

Then she turned, without another word, and went upstairs. The sound of the bedroom door clicking shut might as well have been a coffin lid.

I sat there for a long time. Staring at the floor. My reflection warped in the gloss of the wooden tiles. I *was* a terrible father. No arguing that now.

It was 10:00 PM when I stepped outside for a smoke. The air was cool, still. Even the streetlights seemed dimmer than usual.

I reached into my wallet.

Pulled out the crumpled card.

Stared at the number, my thumb hovering over the screen.

I had no idea who I was inviting into my home. But Liam… *Liam wanted magic.*

And I was out of options.

I dialed.

The phone rang *once*.

Then a rasping voice came through….*gritty and wet*, like someone dragging glass over wet concrete.

***“You’ve reached him.”***

“…Uh. Hey. I was told you do birthday parties.”

Silence….Then  
  
***“How old is the boy?”***

“Six,” I replied slowly.

***“Good age. Still soft.”***

My throat tightened.

“Excuse me?”

No answer, only muffled breathing….”*You were saying?”*

“You….uh, you come highly recommended. Can you make it tomorrow?”

**“Address?”**

It’s 438 Willow Bend Lane, Cresthill Meadows.  Twelve ‘O Clock. Our house. Please don’t be late.”

A low chuckle bled through the line.

***“I am never late. And never early. I arrive when I’m needed most.”***

The line went dead.

No goodbye. No confirmation. Just the hollow click of a call cut short.

The morning came like any other. Sunlight streamed through the curtains, birds chirped in the garden. Normal. Too normal.

We decorated the backyard…streamers, balloons, even some makeshift graffiti banners that said “Super Liam” in big red letters. My wife lit the candles on a gorgeous blue and red cake shaped like a superhero mask. It was perfect.

But I didn’t care about any of it.

My eyes kept drifting to the front gate.

*Waiting.*

*Watching.*

Noon rolled around. The yard filled with laughter and bright little voices. Liam’s friends arrived, their parents trailing behind with gift bags and juice boxes. Music played from the speakers. Everything *looked* like a dream.

But Liam kept glancing at me. Searching the yard. Searching faces.

*The clown hadn’t come*.

Twelve-thirty. Still nothing.

His smile began to fade.

I checked my phone. Tried calling the number again.

Nothing. Just static. Then silence.

I felt sick.

And just when I was ready to break down and tell Liam the clown wasn’t coming, the doorbell rang.

I opened it.

There stood *Mark*….wearing a baggy clown suit and smeared face paint, holding a balloon sword and grinning like an idiot.

His daughter peeked out from behind him.

“Surprise, asshole,” he said. “I figured you were balls deep in failure by now.”

Behind me, Liam let out a scream of pure joy. All the kids gathered around Mark like he was Santa in greasepaint.

He juggled, made balloon animals, tripped over his own shoes. The works. Even my wife cracked a smile.

It was a good party.

Until the music faded and the parents started collecting their sugar-crazed children.

As Mark helped fold the last table, I pulled him aside.

“Hey, listen… thanks. Seriously. You saved me today.”

He nodded. “Yeah. I could see the panic in your face yesterday. I threw something together with some old Halloween gear.”

I blinked. “Wait…..what?”

“Yesterday,” I repeated. “I called you last night. The voice. That creepy-ass whisper. You asked for my address.”

Mark furrowed his brow.

“Dude… what? You didn’t call me. I just showed up because your wife texted me that you were losing it.”

My mouth went dry. “So you didn’t… you didn’t talk to me on the phone?”

“No?” He gave me a weird look. “I hate clowns.” He laughed nervously. “Why? Did I sound creepy or something?”

I didn’t answer.

Because in that moment, the realization struck me cold.

*Mark wasn’t the one I spoke to last night.*

Then who was?

And where was *he*?

The sun had long dipped below the horizon, leaving behind the last gold streaks fading into purple. The backyard was a mess….balloons popped, paper plates scattered, and half-melted cake left out on the table. But the laughter had been real. The smiles genuine.

The party, somehow, had been a success.

After the last guest waved goodbye and the door clicked shut, I carried Liam upstairs. He was half-asleep, cheek resting against my shoulder, still clutching the balloon sword Mark gave him.

I tucked him into bed, pulling the covers up to his chin.

He blinked sleepily at me. “Dad…”

“Yeah, buddy?”

“Today was… *awesome*.” He yawned. “You didn’t forget, right?”

I smiled, brushing his hair back. “Forget what? Your big day? Never.”

He reached up, small fingers curling around mine. “You're the best dad ever.”

That hit harder than any guilt ever could. I leaned down and kissed his forehead.

“Sleep tight, Super Liam.”

“Night, Dad.”

I turned off the light and gently closed his door behind me, standing there for a moment in the dark hallway, just breathing.

Then I made my way to our bedroom.

My wife was already under the covers, scrolling through her phone. She looked up when I entered, set the phone aside, and opened her arms. I slid into bed beside her, and she pulled me close.

“Don’t worry,” she whispered, resting her head against mine. “We’re a team. We got through it.”

I exhaled. “Yeah… it just bugs me. The clown. The one I *actually* called… he never showed.”

She shifted to face me.

“What time did you tell him to come?”

“Twelve o’clock. Noon.”

She raised a brow, a teasing smile creeping in. “Maybe he thought you meant twelve a.m.”

I blinked. “Midnight? What kind of children’s birthday party happens at *midnight*?”

She laughed softly. “Who knows? Maybe he’s just old-school. Or maybe you hired a vampire clown.”

I chuckled, but something about her joke felt just a little too close to something I didn’t want to think about.

“Don’t think too hard about it,” she murmured, eyes already fluttering closed. “The birthday was saved. Your son thinks you’re a hero. End of discussion.”

I leaned over and kissed her.

“Thanks for helping me pull it off,” I said quietly.

She just smiled sleepily and pulled the blanket over her shoulder.

I lay back, staring at the ceiling for a while, my thoughts drifting to that crumpled card still in my wallet… and the voice on the other end of the line.

And somewhere far off….maybe in my bones….*I felt something shifting.* But I closed my eyes And let sleep take me.

I woke to the sound of footsteps outside our bedroom door.

My eyes shifted to the clock.

**12:00 AM.**

Right on the dot.

For a second, I thought I imagined it. Maybe it was the wind. A tree branch. Some part of the house settling.

Then I heard it again; slow, deliberate steps on the hallway floor.

I reached over instinctively. My hand found my wife's arm. Still asleep. Breathing gently.

So then… who was out there?

Burglar.

That was my first thought. Someone trying to break in.

I rolled out of bed silently and opened the dresser drawer. My fingers wrapped around the cold steel of the handgun I kept locked away for emergencies. Safety off. Finger alongside the trigger.

I crept down the hallway, every creak of the wooden floor like thunder under my feet. The living room was empty. So was the den. I swept the front door—locked.

I moved into the kitchen.

That’s when I saw them.

*Muddy footprints.*

Not mine.

Too small to be mine. But too large to be Liam’s.

They trailed across the tiles and stopped near the refrigerator. Then nothing.

I took another step…..

And a **scream** shattered the silence.

High-pitched. Raw. Agonizing.

**“DADDY!!!”**

My heart seized.

It was Liam.

I sprinted down the hallway to his room. The door wouldn’t budge.

It was **locked**.

“LIAM!” I shouted. “Open the door, baby! It’s Daddy!”

No answer—just muffled sobs from the other side.

I didn’t hesitate.

**BANG!**

I fired at the knob. The wood splintered. I kicked it open.

The room was empty.

The window was wide open.

Curtains fluttering in the cold night air.

I rushed to the sill and looked outside.

Down in the backyard….barely visible in the moonlight….. I saw something that stopped my breath.

**A figure.** In a bright **white costume**. Dragging my son by the leg across the grass. Toward the trees. Toward the dark.

“LIAM!” I screamed, stumbling back from the window and tearing through the house to the back door.

I fumbled with the lock and burst into the yard barefoot, the grass cold and wet beneath me.

**“DADDDDY!”** his voice cried again, echoing through the night.

I ran.

I ran like I had never run before, lungs burning, heart pounding in my ears.

But the laughter…

That laughter.

It started low. Almost playful.

Then it twisted into something *feral*.

It grew fainter, deeper into the woods, until it vanished completely....like it was swallowed by the night.

And suddenly, everything was silent.

I slowed, panting, eyes darting in every direction.

And then I saw it.

Right at the edge of the forest.

**A red clown nose.**

Lying in the dirt.

Beside it…..**Liam’s Spider-Man pajama shirt.**

*Torn. Blood on the collar.*

There was something pinned to it. A piece of yellow paper. Same texture as the card from before.

It read:

*“Thank you for the invitation.*

*He smiled just like you said he would.”*

 

By the time I stumbled back to the house, my wife was on the front lawn, screaming into the phone. I could already see the flicker of red and blue lights washing over the street.

The cops questioned me.

I told them **everything**.

The clown.

The card.

The janitor.

The voice on the phone.

They exchanged looks like I was delirious. One of them gently patted my shoulder and said, “We’ll do our best, sir.”

I wanted to scream.

My wife didn’t say anything to me that night.

She just sat on the couch, rocking, sobbing, blaming herself… then blaming me.

But she was right.

*It was my fault.*

I went to work the next morning.

Not to work.

To find the janitor.

The man who handed me that cursed card.

I asked security. HR. Maintenance.

They pulled up the building’s employee registry.

No one by that description.

I stared at the blank hallway near the elevator where I met him, and for a moment, I could almost hear the squeak of his mop again.

**Months passed.**

My wife stopped looking at me.

First, it was subtle. Eyes that once lingered now passed over me like I was furniture. Then she stopped sleeping next to me. She claimed the couch at first said it helped her back. Eventually, she stopped being my wife altogether.

Two weeks after the funeral…..*if you could even call it that….* she moved out. Left behind her keys, her ring, and a silence that settled into the corners of the house like dust.

The detectives arrived on a Thursday. Rain fell in sheets, streaking down the glass and pooling at their feet when I opened the door. I remember one of them tall, hollow-eyed refused to look me in the face. The other held a file to his chest like a shield.

They had found something. *Remains.*

Deep in the woods. *Scattered.*

*DNA confirmed it.*

They told me with measured words and soft tones, voices wrapped in caution like I was fragile. Like I might break. I didn’t say anything. I just stared at the floor. And the sound of the rain filled everything else.

*It’s been over a year now.*

Sometimes, I still wake up at midnight.

Eyes wide, breath caught, heart thudding like it knows something I don’t. In that fragile moment between sleep and reality, I let myself hope.....just for a second.....that it was all a nightmare. That none of it really happened. That I’ll pad downstairs and find my world whole again.

But the footprints are still there.

Tiny, muddy impressions trailing across the kitchen floor. I’ve scrubbed them more times than I can count. Bleach. Vinegar. Baking soda. On my knees until they bruised. But no matter what I do, they always return. Smudged. Wet. Fresh.

And sometimes, when the wind dies down and the night holds its breath, I hear laughter.

Soft. High-pitched. Childlike. Coming from the woods just beyond the edge of our yard. It never lasts more than a moment, but it freezes me in place every time. I don’t dare go looking.

I don’t own a phone anymore. I haven’t in years.

But I kept the card.

It’s old now. Worn around the edges. The ink has begun to fade, and there’s a crease right through the middle where I must’ve clutched it too tightly.

Still, I carry it with me. In my wallet. Always.

Just in case.

In case one day, I work up the nerve to call him back. The clown.

*And ask what he did with the smile I used to see on my son’s face.*

His voice sliced through the room like a whip.

I blinked, heat rising to my cheeks as every eye in the conference room swung to me. My hands trembled slightly around the coffee tray, but I held onto it like my life depended on it.

Luca Steele stood at the head of the long glass table, tall, lethal, and entirely too composed for a man who’d just been drenched in a splash of boiling cappuccino. Steam still rose from his tailored black suit, but his steel-gray eyes were colder than ice.

“You’ve worked for me for two years,” he said, each word slow, deliberate, laced with venom. “And you still manage to be a walking disaster. Fix it. Or quit.”

No one dared to breathe.

The coffee stain spread across the crisp white papers in front of him, slowly bleeding into confidential numbers and contract drafts worth millions. I scrambled forward, grabbing tissues from the tray, muttering apologies that sounded too small, too broken, too pathetic.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Steele—”

“Sorry doesn’t clean Armani.” He stepped back, brushing off his sleeve with visible disgust. “And what the *hell* are you wearing?”

I froze.

His eyes dragged over me. Every inch.

My oversized brown cardigan hung off my shoulders like a borrowed curtain. The faded blouse underneath clung to me awkwardly, a button missing near the collar. The olive-green skirt was too long, too wrinkled, and paired horribly with the scuffed, worn-out flats I’d owned since college.

My foundation was two shades too pale. My lipstick was crooked. The jet-black wig I wore hung limply around my face, uncombed and clearly fake. And the massive round sunglasses I wore indoors? That was the final punchline.

I was a caricature. And everyone knew it.

Chuckles rippled softly across the room.

“I’m not running a charity,” Luca said, cutting through the silence. “If you can’t show up looking like a professional, then don’t show up at all.”

He didn’t wait for a response. He turned his back and walked toward the screen, launching into a presentation like I hadn’t just been stripped of every ounce of dignity in front of ten high-ranking executives.

I stood there, cheeks burning, throat tight.

And then I turned and walked out.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut behind me, I collapsed into the farthest stall. My hands gripped the toilet seat as sobs wracked my chest. Quiet, sharp, hopeless sobs.

I didn’t even care about the coffee anymore. Or the cardigan. Or the snickers in the room.

I was just so… *tired*.

Tired of hiding. Tired of pretending. Tired of working ten times harder just to be invisible.

I reached into my purse for tissues and caught my reflection in the mirror through the gap in the stall door.

*God. I did look awful.*

The glasses had fogged up from my breath. My mascara was smudged beneath the frames. And the wig—it sat like a lifeless animal on my head, tangled, greasy, and suffocating. I buried my face into my hands, trying to breathe.

Then—my phone buzzed.

*LUCA STEELE.*

I swallowed hard.

I wiped my face with toilet paper, fixed my lipstick with shaking fingers, tucked a strand of wig behind my ear, and inhaled once. Twice.

By the time I stepped out of the stall, the tears were gone.

*The mask was back.*

I walked through the hallway, the same hallway I walked every day, except now it felt like a spotlight was burning holes in me. Two interns passed by, whispering a little too loudly.

“*She looks like a blind clown.”*

*“I heard she lives in her car*.”

“*She probably has blackmail on him. No way Steele keeps that thing around otherwise.”*

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t break stride. I never did.

Luca’s office loomed ahead, the frosted glass doors tall and foreboding. I stepped in without knocking.

He didn’t look up.

His office was cold, like everything else about him—monochrome, sharp lines, minimal furniture. But he was the only part of the room that radiated heat. Not warmth—heat. Intensity.

Luca Steele, age twenty-nine, CEO of one of the most ruthless corporate empires in the world. Jet-black tousled hair. Perfectly sculpted jawline. That expensive three-day stubble that looked like it belonged on a magazine cover. And those eyes—ice-colored and emotionless.They’d never softened. Not once.

I handed him the corrected reports in silence.

He barely acknowledged me.

“Get me Victoria Ames on the line. And fix the deck from slide 8 onward. It’s sloppy.”

“Yes, Mr. Steele.”

I turned, heading for the door. My phone rang. I paused, glanced at the screen. *Unknown Number.*

“Hello?” I whispered.

A soft voice crackled on the line. “Hi, this is Carla from the reception desk. There’s… um… there’s a man here to see you.”

My stomach tightened. “A man?” I said, confused. “Who?”

She hesitated. “He gave his name. Said you’d recognize it.”

I waited.

“Jonathan Kingsley.”

## Key Features Analysis

The market offers diverse styles of plastic cups with lids based on varying needs. When evaluating plastic cups with lids, several core features are crucial to consider for optimal value and convenience.

**Material Composition:**

The type of plastic used in the cup’s construction significantly impacts its durability, temperature resistance, and environmental friendliness. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are two common materials. PP offers excellent heat resistance and is microwave-safe in some cases, while PET provides exceptional clarity, making it ideal for showcasing colourful beverages. BPA-free certifications also remain a critical factor for ensuring consumer safety and compliance with health regulations.

**Lid Design and Seal:**

A well-designed lid is crucial to prevent spills and leaks, especially for beverages carried on the go. Consider the type of closure mechanism: snap-on lids offer quicker submission, while screw-on lids generally provide a more secure and leak-proof seal.Venting holes can also be vital for hot drinks to allow steam to escape. The quality of the seal directly affects the cup’s performance in preventing messes.**Cup Durability and Reusability:**

While most plastic cups are designed for single-use convenience, thicker and more durable options can be washed and reused multiple times which saves costs and reduces waste. Look for cups labeled as ""heavy-duty"" or ""reusable,"" indicating a stronger construction. The ability of the cup to withstand daily wear and tear,potential drops and also resistance to cracking are essential aspects of assessing long-term value.

**Insulation Properties:**

Depending on your intended use, consider cups with insulation features. Double-walled designs or insulated sleeves can maintain the temperature of your beverage for longer periods, keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. This feature is especially advantageous for individuals who commute or enjoy outdoor activities. Insulation enhances overall user satisfaction in maintaining drink temperature for longer periods.

**Size and Capacity Options:**

Plastic cups with lids are available in various sizes ranging from small sample cups to large beverage containers. choose a size that appropriately meets your needs. Consider the standard serving sizes for the types of drinks you'll be serving, with specific volume markings (e.g., 8 oz, 12 oz, 16 oz, etc.) which are clearly marked on the cup.

## Core Benefits

Investing in high-quality plastic cups with lids offers a myriad of benefits,extending beyond mere convenience.The right choice can improve user experience and save money long term.

**Enhanced Portability:** Plastic cups with secure lids enable effortless transportation of beverages without the risk of spills when driving, walking or carrying bags. This makes them perfect for commuters, students, and anyone who enjoys taking beverages on-the-go. The portability offered simplifies daily routines and enhances the convenience of enjoying your favorite drinks anywhere, anytime.

**improved Hygiene:** Lids protect your beverage from contaminants such as dust, insects, and airborne particles, ensuring a cleaner and more hygienic drinking experience. This is vital for outdoor events,construction sites,or environments where cleanliness might be compromised. Maintaining hygiene contributes to user health benefits and provides greater product safety.

**Reduced Waste:** Choosing reusable or recyclable plastic cups reduces environmental impact compared to disposable alternatives. Opting for durable and washable options can significantly decrease your contribution to landfill waste. Adopting environmentally conscious choices promotes sustainability and responsible consumption.

**Cost Savings:** While reusable plastic cups may have a higher upfront cost, they can save money in the long run by eliminating the need to constantly repurchase disposable cups. For businesses, switching to durable and reusable cups can represent a notable cost reduction over time. The long term cost efficiency makes reusable cups a financially sound choice.

## FAQs Section

Consumers commonly have questions related to the safety, usability, and maintenance of plastic cups with lids before making a purchase. Understanding of the answers improves selection and use of the best option.

**Are plastic cups with lids safe for hot beverages?**

It depends on the type of plastic. Always check the product description or labeling to ensure the cup is designed to withstand high temperatures. PP (Polypropylene) cups are generally considered safe for hot beverages; though, PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) cups may warp or release chemicals at excessive temperatures. Make sure your cups are labeled “heat-resistant” or “microwave-safe” when dealing with hot liquids.

**Can plastic cups with lids be recycled?**

Many plastic cups with lids are recyclable, but it depends on your local recycling facilities and the type of plastic. Check the recycling symbol on the cup and lid to determine if they are accepted in your area. Separating the lid from the cup can also improve the likelihood of successful recycling.

**How do I clean reusable plastic cups with lids effectively?**

Wash reusable plastic cups with lids with warm water and dish soap. For stubborn stains or odors, use a mixture of baking soda and water. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrub brushes as they can scratch the plastic. Ensure the lid and cup are thoroughly dried before storing to prevent mold growth.

## Ideal User Profile

Identifying potential target audiences based on specific use case criteria can offer better solutions.

**Event Organizers:** Planners needing cups for events should consider the durability, reusability, and recyclability of options that may be reused during events or responsibly disposed of afterwards. PP cups offer heat-resistance if hot drinks are served; otherwise PET cups offer the most visual exposure of the beverages offered.

1mcxi8e,https://i.redd.it/cxer6oumyxff1.jpeg,Pay Tax for What? I Don’t Even Get the Perks (So I did this),"Hey folks,

A while back I posted on a few subreddits about an idea I had. Flying from India to Vietnam, buying a MacBook there, and coming back... hopefully saving some cash. A few people said it’s doable, but many suggested I should explore Vietnam too, so I did. 😎

If you’re planning to buy a MacBook or iPhone worth ₹2 lakh+ in India trust me it's worth making a short trip to Vietnam. You’ll get the device cheaper *and* squeeze in a mini vacation.

# My Story & Experience

* Got my eVisa, booked the cheapest round-trip flight (₹19K), and headed to Hanoi, the capital.
* Stayed 11 nights (was working remotely not recommended, But I had good time. more on that later).
* Explored nearby places on weekends or evenings, and yes bought my MacBook there!

# Tips from Experience

* **Don’t take your work laptop** and plan to “work and travel.” Just take 4-7 days off and enjoy. You won’t cover the entire country anyway.
* I only traveled for 5 days during my 11-night stay and honestly, that was more than enough for a refreshing experience.

# Where I Bought My MacBook

After visiting more than 15 stores in nearby areas.

✅ **Good Store (Price matched FPT, gave tax refund document)**:  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/dyqNYEwGxLjtjEsFA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dyqNYEwGxLjtjEsFA)

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/QP2NcH4P5MToqBC26](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QP2NcH4P5MToqBC26)

* Always ask: “Do you provide VAT refund documents for the airport?” Some stores won’t.
* They even helped me *carefully* open the MacBook to inspect it and resealed it for airport VAT refund smart move!
* **VAT Refund Counter:** Noi Bai Airport, Gate No. 31. I got back \~$111 (8.5% minus charges).

# Cost Breakdown

|Ninh Binh|₹4,500|
|Stay (11 nights)|₹4,000|
|Food & Extra|₹5,000|
|**Total Trip**|**\~₹40,000**|

# The MacBook Deal

* **MacBook Pro M4 14"" (Base)**
   * **India (Amazon):** ₹1,89,900
   * **With card offers:** \~₹1,85,000
   * **Vietnam (after refund):** \~₹1,48,500 (I paid total ₹1,58,125 at store and got $111 refund at airport )

**🧮 Net Savings on MacBook alone: ₹36,500**  
So basically, add ₹5K and you got yourself a brand-new MacBook *and* a vacation in Vietnam.

# If You Plan To Do This, Read This First:

* 🍜 Vegetarian? Food hunt might be tricky. Double check *every time* (It's expensive)
* ☕ Must try *Coconut Coffee*
* 🚌 Public transport in Hanoi is **super cheap** and reliable. Google Maps + their local apps are just too good. Just show the conductor your destination. (This will save fuck loads of money)

# Final Total I Spent

* **MacBook + 11-day trip total:** ₹2,08,117 (before refund)

That's where I slowly realized this hack, just unaware of the term.

My first recall of ever actively applying it was some time ago in high school, I made a verbal deal with my best friend, if I don't confess to my crush after school, I buy him coffee the next morning. Suddenly, the consequence for failing was real and immediate. So i did it. Guess what, I got rejected. But its far far better than inaction and regrets.

I just realized that term now from Atomic Habits and some old articles about loss aversion. Everyone had their ""Stake"", we were just unaware when we had applied it, sometime in our lives when we rely on an external force to overcome our own internal willpower.

1mcxerd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGameTheorists/comments/1mcxerd/secret_of_the_mimic_edwins_inventions_work/,Secret of the mimic. Edwin's Inventions work.,"In SOTM Edwin Murray is known as a genius inventor who just cant seem to get his inventions right. He inherited his company from his father. In the books the company that parallels MCM was a Vacuum company. In SOTM Edwin's first and only successful invention was a Robotic vacuum, the clean-o-vac.  (Edwin's first creation was basically a Roomba.)

This breakout success funded Edwin's company until the end. His other inventions as given to us in the game are the Stay up Latte, the Magic Coat rack, the Mycellium Men, and Jest Cereal along with various animatronics and animatronic accessories.

In the game Edwin is noted to jump from project to project without refining his work into something that wont eventually backfire. This is presented in the game as Edwin trying to build something better than the Clean-O-Vac with a recording of Fionna trying to get Edwin to attend his Son's birthday party and Edwin refusing claiming that the thing he is working on will be bigger than the Clean-O-Vac.

He is always working on something ""Bigger than the Clean-O-Vac""

Many have noted that the technology that went into Edwin's inventions (most obviously the Magic coat rack, and Mycellium Men) were used in the creation of the Mimic endoskeleton. This theory takes that view from another perspective.

Edwin builds robots, it is what he wants to do. His robotic vacuum was his first successful robot and the next thing he wants to make isn't a coatrack, it is a robot that blows his first out of the water. A fully functional robot able to perform any task.

The coat rack didn't work because it was never meant to be a coatrack in the first place it was meant for the mimic from the start. The Mycellium men are the next contender for mimic technology and can be seen all over the factory listening and repeating private conversations.

The stay up Latte and the Jest Cereal are food and drink. Why was Edwin selling food and drink?

The latte machine Edwin built was a coffee machine, how did that send someone to the hospital? 

A joy buzzer in a Jest cereal box paralyzed a dog.  Who uses a joy buzzer on a dog and if it is strong enough to induce paralysis how on earth is the complaint not about a hurt person? 

I could come up with an explanation (Sabotage) but there is little to no evidence to help point one way or the other here.

This theory has Jest Cereal and the Stay up Latte being good functional products one being a stimulant that Edwin likely used himself and the other a simple toy in a cereal box with both failures being orchestrated by outside parties aiming to harm MCM and drive them out of business.

The core of this theory is that Edwin did not jump from project to project without finishing the last but was instead always working on the mimic project a robot better than his first.

And he succeeded.

Unfortunately.

We didn’t really talk on the way back. Just watched the road and trees crawl on and on. It was a long way back into town. The others made us slow, Mark limped, his leg hastily bandaged up, and Adi trudged hunched over, beneath his ragged shirt deep gashes pulled at his back and shoulders. I got off the lightest with only a line of bruises across my torso. But even so, I wanted more than anything to fall into bed and sleep for a long time.

It was Sunday morning and town was quiet. Adi turned off first down his street and soon after I farewelled Mark and headed west towards home. The lines of oaks moved in the wind. Leaves fell, still green with summer, across the immense tarmac and wide immaculate lawns. Most cars still sat in their driveways, it was far too early and far too cold to get out of bed. A brave few were out, empty lots outside empty homes.

Our house stood small and sickly blue and white. I fumbled for my key. I’d meant to be back in time for church, but we were delayed. There were, of course, going to be the questions and scowls and tellings-off, but I wasn’t worried. This time was no different. We had been through the big song and dance before. I’d find myself at evening service instead and perhaps confession and it’d be never spoken of again.

I dragged myself upstairs into the shower and scoured my wounds. The water was gloriously warm with no one else to compete with. I let my bruises soak and melt away, let myself breathe the humid air and push out a sigh. Felt the heat once again fill me. The water fell on my face. It was a long time before it ran cold, and my thoughts went back along our return walk, out into the forest. Out to where we had hiked, a hut in the pines, a fire, dinner, drinks. As I stepped out of the shower I stumbled, grabbing, grasping at the glass, feet sliding on wet tile. I fell short of the cabinet, hard onto the floor. My skull only an inch from cracking itself open on the vanity. But my chest and knees were not so spared, the bruises I had just washed away were again sprouting, black and aching across my body. 

I hobbled to the bedroom and found something in the wardrobe. But as I turned to the mirror the room seemed different than as I’d left it yesterday. I checked the false drawer in the bedside dresser was still locked and the hole beneath the bed still concealed. Someone had certainly tidied up. But it wasn’t just that. It felt like I’d been away a lot longer. The smell was different. Like all the air had been replaced. Something. I looked at the bed and it took every effort to not fall face first into sleep. The blankets were pulled tight, not a crease was visible, like it had never been slept in. I shook the feeling away. I left the room behind and went down painfully for food.

Sunday was grocery day so there was very little for breakfast. I found only a single grapefruit and the last couple slices of bread, sad and stale. At the table I sprinkled sugar and scraped butter. The kettle boiled and I poured the coffee pot. Maybe I ought to go to bed to avoid the confrontation, I could hop in now and be asleep before they return. Either way I need to clean up before they are back or that’ll be another thing Mum can complain about, her immaculate counter dirtied with dust, and I probably scratched the plate too. I finished the toast and started on the fruit and was no more than a few bites in when they arrived. The car didn’t make much sound, coming in smooth and silent. The doors slammed and their voices, hushed and muffled, came slowly to the front door. Their key seemed to struggle, the lock sticking even more than it always had, and the bottom of the door caught on the sill. It took a solid kick to dislodge it, and the three of them tumbled inwards. Dad in his suit, Mum her coat and heels, and Warren in the trousers that collected on his shoes. Mum was the first one to see me. I swallowed.

“Hi…,” she said, “are you here with Giles?”

I looked up nonchalantly from my food to the three of them standing surprised in the entrance hall. You could tell the service had run long, they had the impatient scowls that form when the priest tries to go on about in the homily, those knotted edges of your cheeks that take the rest of the day to unfurl.

“Hi guys,” I said, “I just got home—”

“—Sorry, is Giles here too?” Mum said.

“Ah… what?”

“Who are you? Where is Giles?”

“What? What are you doing Mum?”

She turned to Dad. “Darling…” She put her hand on his arm.

“What—what is this?” I continued, getting annoyed, “I get it, I’m sorry. I meant to get back earlier but Mark got hurt walking back and we had to carry him and it slowed us down and my phone was dead. It’s okay, I’ll go later—”

“—Son, tell us who you are.”

“What? What do you mean?” I raised my palms in a shrug.

“Giles!” Dad shouted down the hall. “Giles!” He moved further down the hall, and started up the stairs, shouting all the way. Mum looked at me.

“Is he here?” she asked, her face was confused and angry.

“Who?” I asked, my own anger now filling out my voice.

“Giles. My son.”

“I’m right here.” I raised my arms out fully. “Mum what are you—”

“—He’s not here!” Dad shouted from above.

“Then who the hell are you?” Mum shouted, “How’d you get in here?”

“With my key, obviously.” I held it up sarcastically. “Can you all please stop this.”

Dad was in the room now, he loomed towards me. He was not an angry man. He had the same fire and same heart as anyone does, but he didn’t exercise it. So when he did get mad he let it out in a great burst, as someone who hasn’t run in years does when faced with a mile. He would start blearing out of the gate, and end it limping and wheezing. But for that short sprint he could run as well as anyone, and now as he strode towards me, I prepared for it.

“Son, who the fuck do you think you are breaking in here, eating our food,” he was coming ever closer, “How’d you get in here, huh? Where’d you steal the key—”

“—Dad.” 

He grabbed me by my jacket, pulling me out of the seat. He was small, but I was smaller. He pushed me against the bench. Mum and Warren came closer as Dad pinned me. I looked from him, to Mum, whose eyes were watery and far away. She never liked fighting. She’d get him to do the talking whilst she slunk off to some room to cover her ears. Fighting in our house was a calm and orderly matter, done with utmost efficiency. But this time it was bad. Dad leaned close. “Where the hell is Giles?! What’d you do…where the fuck is my son?!”

“Dad, it’s me. I’m Giles, I’m right here!”

His eyes went wide at that and he pushed me away. I stood alone in the middle of the room, encircled by them. 

“Guys what the hell is going on!?” Tears were starting.

“He thinks he’s our son,” Mum said.

“I heard. Stay right there boy. Honey, call the police.”

“Dad, what are you doing, what happened?” I reached to grab the phone from Mum. As I moved he came lunging for me. I darted back. He kept coming.

“Dad stop—”

“—I said don’t move. Stay there. We will sort this out. You’re obviously confused and not yourself—”

I don’t know what that stirred in me, perhaps it was the three of them around me, or Dad’s deflating hands now trying to comfort me like trapped livestock, or the half-finished breakfast still on the bench behind him, but I felt I had to run. Right then was the only chance of escape, the small gap between Warren and Mum was where I had to go. I turned, and before the first number could be dialled I was out the door and out the gate and into the wide street. I ran and ran and ran. Leaves kept falling around me, my feet thundered along the pavement and all I could think was how Warren hadn’t even looked at me.",1,1753849907.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1mcx8xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1mcx8xp/i_propose_to_you_a_party_idea_meal_prep_party/,I propose to you a party idea: MEAL PREP PARTY,"I’m on mobile so formatting sucks. Also English is not my native language.

I have never been the type to do parties but meal prep party is awesome.

We are a small family with a 9mo and 3.5 yr girl. And no family near by to help for extended period of time. We very rarely eat out so the key thing for us is meal prep. However, we have two working parents and even though my schedule is more flexible than most, we struggle to squeeze out time for meal prep. And that is where is all started.

I tried this with two families and it both went great and we are going to do that again.

With the first family, they have a sham and a working dad. Their two kids are 2mo and 3 yr. We have been doing playdates for the last two years on weekly basis so the older kids are fairly comfortable with both parents. We narrowed down the recipe: wontons. They are easier to make than dumplings shape wise and freeze really well raw. To serve, just get some soup and boil in water 5-10 mins. Also the stuffing has pork and cabbage in there so protein, veggies and carbs are all present. When they got to our house, the dad took the kids and us moms got to working while we chitchat throughout the process. They brought over the ground meat and I prepped the cabbage and bought the wonton wrappers. Normally, it would take me 2 hrs to prep, make 4-5meal worth and cleanup. Well with two working hands, we got triple the amount in 1.5 hr and both enjoy the adult socialization. The dads took the kids in the playroom and later out to the park. We all had fun and ended up with way more food than we thought.

With the second family, the mom, dad and their 10yr old daughter came. This time, we did curry saucy and fried chicken. Again, the dad took the baby, and their 10 yr old was playing with my 3 yr old. Us moms just work away in our kitchen. Just like last time, what normally would take me 3hrs to do everything and clean up, it took less than 2 hrs for triple the result. Both family and up with 3 meal worth of food and had a lot of fun doing it.

If you want to try it, here is what I recommend

1. Narrow down a recipe that freeze well, easy to heat up and everyone eats. At least 1 person needs to be very comfortable with the recipe and ideally the recipe is not complicated.

2. Split the ingredients so that both (all) participating family pitches in. 

3. Plan ahead for containers to take the food. I have a vacuum sealer and it works great with wontons. But for curry, I had the other family bring over their containers

4. Divide and conquer. My husband is not as good in the kitchen as me so he stays on child duty. However it is significantly easier to deal with 4 kids between two adults than 1 adult with 2 kids.

5. Plan ahead on space. The nice thing about this is you will only dirty 1 kitchen. And thus only need to clean 1 kitchen. So it  would be best to plan ahead on who is going to be at which station. For example, when we were frying chicken, I will need to bread everything then start frying. However, with another pair of hands, I only do the breading and the other mom did all the frying so it went by a lot quicker.

6. Enjoy your time! I do not trying this with people you just meet since it does require some level of understanding that other will use your kitchen or vise versa. However, cooking is also a great time for bounding and socializing considering the most of the time you can talk with other adults about any topics when your hands are busy.

There you have it. My ultimate guide to Meal Prep Party. I honestly wish I have done this sooner. Things gets done so much faster and easier.

Next time your mom friends want to hangout but you are tired of the same park/ coffee shop you have been going to, maybe consider having a meal prep party instead!",8,1753849878.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

# Lelit Glenda Gasket Replacement: 2025 best DIY Guide

The Lelit Glenda is a popular espresso machine known for its reliability and ability too produce cafe-quality coffee at home. though, like all espresso machines, certain parts are subject to wear and tear. The group head gasket, a crucial component responsible for sealing the portafilter to the group head, is one of the most frequently replaced parts on the Lelit Glenda.This gasket ensures that pressure is maintained during the brewing process, preventing leaks and allowing for proper extraction. A worn or damaged gasket can lead to poor espresso quality, inconsistent shots, and potential damage to the machine itself. this guide provides a thorough overview of the Lelit Glenda gasket replacement for 2025, offering clear steps and insights to help you perform this essential maintenance task yourself.

## Key Features Analysis

The Lelit glenda gasket replacement process is relatively straightforward,but understanding the key aspects of the gasket and the required tools is crucial for a successful DIY repair.

**High-Quality Silicone Construction:** The standard Lelit Glenda gasket is typically made from food-grade silicone.

The use of silicone ensures heat resistance and flexibility, allowing the gasket to maintain a tight seal even at high temperatures. High-quality silicone is also resistant to degradation from coffee oils and cleaning solutions, extending the lifespan of the gasket. Over time, the silicone will harden so it is indeed essential to keep an eye on its health.

**Precise Dimensions for Optimal Seal:** the Lelit Glenda gasket has specific dimensions designed to create a tight and leak-proof seal between the group head and the portafilter.These dimensions typically include an inner diameter, outer diameter, and thickness that are precisely engineered to match the Lelit Glenda's group head. Using a gasket with incorrect dimensions can lead to leaks, inconsistent espresso extraction, and even damage to the machine.Measurements can vary ever so slightly, so comparing it visually with the old gasket is essential.**Food-Safe and BPA-Free Material:** Gaskets intended for espresso machines must be made from food-safe materials, such as food-grade silicone, to prevent contamination of the espresso.

ensuring the gasket is BPA-free further protects the health of the user by preventing the leaching of harmful chemicals into the coffee. Always confirm that the replacement gasket meets food safety standards before installation.

**Easy Installation design:** A well-designed gasket should be relatively easy to install and remove, typically without requiring specialized tools.The Lelit Glenda gasket usually features a slightly flexible design that allows it to be easily inserted into the group head.Proper sizing and material properties contribute to a snug fit that ensures a reliable seal.Key features of the Lelit Glenda gasket include:

   Heat resistance up to typical espresso brewing temperatures
   Resistance to coffee oils and cleaning solutions
   Food-grade silicone construction
   Precise dimensions for a leak-proof seal

## Core Benefits

Replacing the Lelit Glenda gasket provides several key benefits, including improved espresso quality, prevention of machine damage, and cost savings.

**Improved Espresso Quality:** A new gasket ensures a tight seal between the portafilter and the group head, maintaining consistent pressure during extraction.

This consistent pressure is essential for creating high-quality espresso with optimal crema and flavor. A worn or damaged gasket can cause pressure loss, resulting in weak, watery espresso. replacing the gasket restores the machine's ability to produce rich, flavorful shots.

**Prevention of Machine Damage:** A leaking gasket can allow water to seep into othre parts of the machine, potentially causing corrosion or damage to electrical components.

Replacing the gasket promptly prevents water leaks and protects the machine from more serious damage.Consistent pressure is maintained throughout the machine.Regular gasket replacement can extend the lifespan of the Lelit Glenda and prevent costly repairs.

**Cost Savings:** Replacing the gasket yourself is a cost-effective way to maintain your Lelit Glenda.

Professional repair services can be expensive,especially if you need to ship the machine for servicing. Performing the gasket replacement yourself saves on labour costs and allows you to keep your machine in top condition.

**enhanced Machine Performance:** Replacing an old, hardened gasket enhances the overall performance of the espresso machine.

A fresh gasket provides the necessary flexibility and sealing ability to optimize the brewing process. This results in consistent shot times, proper extraction, and the ability to fine-tune your espresso recipes for the best possible flavor. A new gasket gets you ready for the next brewing session.

## FAQs Section

**How frequently enough should I replace the Lelit Glenda group head gasket?**

The recommended replacement frequency for the Lelit Glenda group head gasket is typically every 6 to 12 months, depending on usage and water quality. If you notice leaks around the portafilter, difficulty locking the portafilter into place, or a decline in espresso quality, it's a good indication that the gasket needs replacement.

**What tools do I need to replace the Lelit Glenda group head gasket?**

You typically need a few basic tools to replace the gasket, including a flathead screwdriver or a gasket pick to remove the old gasket, a soft cloth or brush to clean the group head, and potentially some food-grade lubricant to ease installation of the new gasket. Avoid using sharp objects that could scratch or damage the group head.

**Can I use any type of silicone gasket for the Lelit Glenda?**

No, it's crucial to use a gasket specifically designed for the Lelit glenda to ensure proper fit and sealing. Using a generic gasket or one with incorrect dimensions can lead to leaks and poor espresso quality. Always check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure compatibility.

**How do I choose the right size gasket for my Lelit Glenda?**

Letter 1,"It's been well over 2 years since I've had an insomnia episode, but here I am. Exhausted...mentally, but my body finds itself awake. Its been a long time since I've thought about you. Maybe, it's the familiarity of not being able to sleep on a clear summers night, while my brain remembers that summer where two strangers shared in each others existence. Even if it only was for a few months, even if it only left traces of a well formed friendship. 

Do you remember that one night, where I got your birthday wrong and snuck some extra cash to buy you my favorite poetry book? It wasn't your birthday, but for 6 hours in the middle of the night we pretended it was. You sat outside your hotel smoking in your car, I sat outside my prison, curled up in a camping chair. We kept hoping our phone batteries wouldn't drain too fast from Snapchat video calling. 

I was shy, worried that while I messed your birthday up, you would find my gift silly. Somehow, you talked me into reading my favorite poems to you. I didn't stutter, or argue. I would glance at you, with your eyes closed and a smirk on your face. You were disappearing with me into the words, getting lost in the corner coffee shop somewhere in Paris. 

I don't think I've reread that book since. It's weird, because you're gone from my life, stuck in that chapter of my book. I left you there, but yet I pick and choose very carefully what I give and take from you. I've taken the anime you showed me, turned it into a comfort show. The cursed Bee Man still lives on the back of that church offering envelope, tucked safely inside a bag of keepsakes, just incase one day we meet and we still want to share him as a friendship tattoo. I have a deep love for Corey Taylor, even saw him live...but only because you made me love Slipknot. I sing Beanie Season, when the leaves change and the air gets cooler. I still look at the moon, and leave the green gummy bears. Not just because I dont like them, but there's a comfort in knowing you'd take them. 

I've taken a sleeping pill, and decided to talk to you while it kicks in...that was 25 minutes ago. I can see the stars from my window, and I finally feel tired enough to sleep. I miss you old friend, and I hope those demons you battled so hard have finally silenced themselves, and you've found the type of safety and comfort you so selflessly gave out.

So far, all I’ve purchased is a light green/sage couch and 2 small ottomans (photos of each attached). I still need an accent chair, rug, coffee table, side tables, etc. second photo shows small dining space in the corner that I’m also not sure what to do with. 
I’ve been looking at rugs ALL DAY and I’m at a loss. I want something that ties it all together as a cozy, warm space thats inviting but no so put together that you never use it. 
Any help with furniture, layout, color palette, advice will help so much. ",0,1753849375.0,DesignMyRoom,1,0.5,False

He was just another CS student overwhelmed with YouTube and Reddit startup ideas.

But one day, while helping his roommate automate a repetitive Amazon task, the idea clicked.

He built a **simple browser extension** that:

* Automatically applies the best coupons at checkout
* Helps users track hidden price drops

With no audience, no followers — he posted it on Reddit + Product Hunt.  
Got **1,100 users in 4 days**.

Then came the unexpected goldmine:  
💰 **Affiliate commissions + premium upgrade**  
→ $3/month per pro user, and \~7% commission via affiliate links.

Today:

* 12,000+ active users
* \~2,400 premium subscribers
* \~$7.2K/month in profit (and growing)
* No team. No office. Just Wi-Fi + Coffee.
