My returner, let's call her Paige, was very defensive from the first week and started badmouthing me to coworkers and our supervisor (including telling me not to do something and then complaining that I didn't do it, and telling me not to report safety equipment that was past its expiration and getting mad when I did it anyway.)

Luckily, I had our Slack messages and let our supervisor read them, and could prove that I hadn't just decided not to do my job. At one point, another coworker told me that Paige thought I was going to try to get her fired because I have a reputation as a rule follower. There have also been some other weird interactions that I haven't bothered to bring up to my supervisor. In addition, our job lets us collaborate, although it isn't required, and when you collaborate you split the paperwork in half. Paige was consistently not submitting event proposals until the day we had planned the event for, and telling me that she had, only for us to not be able to do an event because she hadn't submitted the proposal.

We ended up switching in January so I was doing the proposals, and last week I found out that she hadn't submitted a single evaluation for the last three months, which means none of the events counted. Thankfully my supervisor let me submit all the evals that day, but that still meant I had to do all the proposals, advertising, and evaluations for 5-6 events, and I ended up running most of the events too. The last straw for me was when we collaborated with another coworker pair for an event, and I showed up 15 minutes early to set up, only for the other pair to not arrive until the event was over halfway done and for Paige to not show up at all, and then text me asking me not to tell our supervisor.

Since then, I've kind of been avoiding Paige because I was pissed off. She texted me last week asking when I wanted to meet to plan our April events and I didn't respond. Today I had a three-hour meeting where I was on the disciplinary hearing committee, which is kind of a big emotional investment (not that I can tell her that's what I was doing, because it's completely confidential) and she cornered me after in our local coffee shop to ask why I didn't respond to her text. I told her that finding a time to meet wasn't my biggest priority  and she asked me why not. I asked if we had to have the conversation right then, and she said yes, so I said that I don't really care about collaborating with her, so I haven't been prioritizing it. Then she said she doesn't know why I wouldn't want to collaborate with her and I was very frustrated, so I said ""you haven't done an evaluation in the last three months and you didn't show up to our last event at all. Why would I?"" and then she got mad and said that I should have just texted her that I didn't want to collaborate. I just kind of said ""sure, whatever"" and went home to be done with it, but now I'm feeling guilty for being rude, so I don't know.",1,1743043865.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I (20f) have been sick since the second week of September, and it is now March. When I got sick in the beginning of sept, I think I caught whatever my weird ass roomate had. My symptoms were: Yellowing of the white part of the eyes (not fully like jaundice but like a chunky line), fevers, cold sweats, headache, nausea, trouble holding down food and water, shakiness in both arms, dizziness, abdominal pain, pain in belly button, neck pain, and shoulder pain. When I had intense nausea for five days straight, I went to the resources on campus, and they said it was nothing and that I needed to take Pepto Bismol when it started up again, which usually was the worst for me in the morning. Once I ended up taking it, I went to the ER when they started accepting patients because I was in so much pain. Long story short, they found out I had an appendicolith and lots of ovarian cysts (and a sister cyst). After that, I've been in and out of the doctors/ER trying to get accurate ""directions"" since I kept getting the runaround. Long story short I have seen an ENT, OB, Endo, and I will finally get to see a GI but not for almost another month (I have been waiting since September). Ob thinks it's viral syndrome, but that can't be confirmed till I see GI. ENT has no idea. Endos only involvement is checking out why my cortisol levels are high and the only thing ruled out so far is Cushing's- I am currently waiting on word back about results/next steps. I have also had a table tilt test done, and I met the criteria for POTS- although one of my main problems is the abdominal pain/dizziness, so I ""have"" POTS. As my cortisol levels have been high I did book an appt for OB to explore endometriosis since that is looking more likely now- although not the main problem. I have had about 40 labs/tests done so far. What I have figure out so far: most of the time I have to eat something bland, digestion seems slowed, I have started to process sugars super late or fast, and sometimes I process sugar before water - even if I had the water two hours before (it makes me sick, don't recommend). Some GI problems make sense, but I can't figure out where the yellowing of the eyes is coming from- they also said my liver was fine. I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't thorough; it's been messy af.


Symptoms List total:
Yellowing of white of eyes, fevers, cold sweats, headache, nausea, trouble holding down food and water, shakiness in both arms, dizziness, abdominal pain, pain in belly button, neck pain, shoulder pain, muscle spasms, pain in chest, strained eyesight, inconsistent sleep (wake up multiple times a night or can't fall asleep), pressure behind eyes, slight quick burning sensation when going pee, fatigue, more brain fog, high heart rate (when changing positions/moving too fast- or something related to interval training would kill), bloating

Symptoms that are still here occasionally: 
Yellowing of white of eyes, headache, nausea, trouble holding down food and water, shakiness in both arms, dizziness, abdominal pain, pain in belly button, neck pain, shoulder pain, muscle spasms, pain in chest, strained eyesight, inconsistent sleep (wake up multiple times a night or can't fall asleep), pressure behind eyes, slight quick burning sensation when going pee (so on and off, vv random- and no utis), fatigue, more brain fog, high heart rate (when changing positions/moving too fast- or something related to interval training would kill), sensitivity to temp (cold or hot), bloating

The most consistent: 
Headache, nausea, dizziness, abdominal pain, pain that radiates from chest to abdomen, anything related to eyes or sleep, extreme/mild fatigue (I can't function without coffee or a bit of sugar), brain fog, heart rate/blood pressure high, sensitivity to temp, bloating",1,1743043841.0,AskHealth,0,1.0,False
1jku4bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jku4bw/are_we_dismissing_dark_roast_too_quickly/,Are We Dismissing Dark Roast Too Quickly?,"I’ll be honest—I usually avoid dark roast at home. Not because I think it’s *bad*, but mostly because my grinder hates it. The oils get everywhere, and cleaning it feels like a whole project. So, for the longest time, I just stuck to my usual light roasts, convinced that dark roast wasn’t really for me. I’ve got my routine: a V60, light and fruity beans, and a pour-over that I pretty much do by feel. It works, and I never really saw a reason to change it.

But then there’s *the moment*. You know the one—when family or loved ones find out you love coffee, and suddenly, every birthday or holiday, you’re gifted a bag of supermarket dark roast. It’s sweet, and I appreciate it, but I always end up staring at the bag like… *what do I do with this?* It feels almost *wrong* to just let it sit there, but every time I’ve tried brewing it, I never quite enjoy the result.

That’s why I was caught off guard when I recently had an iced dark roast at [Hoshino](https://www.instagram.com/hoshinocoffeesg/), this Japanese restaurant chain. No expectations, just needed something cold. And wow. It was deep, bold, but *so* well-balanced. None of the burnt bitterness I usually associate with dark roast. And the best part? They serve it with these tiny straws, so you sip it really slowly, like you’re meant to appreciate every little bit of it. They also gave me a little jug of syrup, but I didn’t even touch it. It was perfect as is.

Now, am I going to start brewing dark roast at home? Probably not—I’m still too scared of wrecking my grinder. But it *did* make me wonder… have I been too quick to write it off? Maybe I just haven’t found the *right* one yet.

For now, I’m sticking to my light roasts [(here’s a clip of one of my usual pours)](https://youtube.com/shorts/aegiP-JP7Y0?si=a-D1UMWgBzUhLu1h), but I’m curious—any dark roast fans here? What am I missing?",2,1743043828.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share our itinerary from our recent trip to Maui from 3/15 to 3/23.  We had an absolutely wonderful time, and wanted to share a little bit about our experience, since we found this subreddit to be tremendously helpful in planning our trip. 

Since we've got small children at home (they stayed with the grandparents - thanks mom!), we wanted to spend a good amount of time just relaxing on the beach in paradise, eating awesome food, and then have a few little excursions sprinkled in without the kids. 

We stayed 5 nights in Kihei and 3 nights in Napili.  Don't know that I would do that again but ended up working out well for us.

 Day 1 (Saturday, 3/14)

* Landed at OGG around 5pm, picked up the rental car, checked into our VRBO at Sugar Beach Resort in Kihei, and wandered the complex a bit
* Stopped in for dinner at South Maui Fish Co for some poke.  It was fantastic
* Grabbed a few things from the Foodland grocery store and then went to bed

 Day 2 (Sunday, 3/15)

* Went for a run along the beach in front of the condo
* Headed over to Ulua beach for the day and took it easy for the most part.  Saw several BIG whale breaches right off the shore
* Wandered over through the Shops at Wailea for a bit
* Grabbed more poke at Island Grocers next to the Shops, and it was pretty darn solid and reasonably priced
* Had a few drinks and dinner at Maui Brewing

 Day 3 (Monday, 3/16)

* Headed over to Kam 1 to beach for the morning - chilled and watched the whales again
* Had lunch at Paia Fish Market in Kihei - In terms of bang for our buck, this was one of our favorite meals. Something about that cajun seasoning with their ""magic"" sauce just hit different.  Lunch prices were very reasonable here as well
* Headed up to Haleakala in the afternoon to do a little hiking.  Started at Hosmer Grove, hit a few other stops along the way, and then hiked a good way down Sliding Sands Trail.  We went farther than we planned on just waiting for the clouds to clear up, and they eventually did.  The scenery was absolutely stunning for us midwestern folk.  The hike back up was… a bit challenging but it was worth it (and yes, we were warned multiple time and still did it)
* Originally planned on staying for sunset but we were wiped from the hike and just wanted to head back.  Might have to try again for sunrise/sunset next time
* Stopped at the Costco Food trucks for dinner - I had a plate of shrimp from Geste's and my wife had a burger from a place whose name I am blanking on (it's on the end next to Geste's).  The shrimp was solid and the burger was fine

 Day 4 (Tuesday, 3/17)

* Breakfast at the original Kihei Caffe.  I had the eggs benedict and it was great.  Really good coffee as well
* Headed down to Makena Beach.  Certainly a bit of a different vibe and swell than the Kihei/Wailea beaches but enjoyed our time there, up until the shark sighting
* Had reservations for an early dinner at Mama's Fish House so we headed north.  Unfortunately, this was probably the most disappointing meal we had considering what we paid.  It was fine but for $60-$80 a plate, we were hoping it would blow our socks off and it didn't really
* After dinner we stopped in at Ho'okipa beach to watch the surfers and turtles.  Holy moly the north shore is no joke, but enjoyed watching some very talented surfers and seeing the little honu
* Headed back to Maui Brewing to grab a few beers before bed

 Day 5 (Wednesday, 3/18)

* This was our Road to Hana day.  We enjoyed this far more than we were expecting to.  I had a blast driving the road (yielded for locals of course).  We used the Guide Along app, but since we started at Pipiwei and then hit all our stops on the way back, I had a hard time figuring out which route to use (even though it explains it in the app, I didn't realize I needed to download both the original and reverse routes in order for it to work as intended).  Small inconvenience but still enjoyed it
* Guide Along doesn't recommend starting at Pipiwei but we thought it was a great way to do it
* Pipiwei trail was STUNNING.  Can't recommend it enough.  Got lucky that we still had the national park receipt in the rental car because it's good for 3 days, and the pipiwei is also within the national park which I did not realize
* Stopped at the black sand beach and state park for a 1230 reservation.  Unfortunately it rained pretty substantially which isn't unusual but we didn't stay too long.  Hit most of the other classic stops on the way back
* On the way to black sand we stopped for a quick lunch at a place near Hana that had a few different food trucks.  We didn't really have a specific meal planned out.  Another group told us to try Orale Taco and said it was their favorite food on the island so we did.  OH MY GOODNESS Y'ALL.  This place is a hidden gem.  I don't think it's hyperbole to say that these were the best street tacos we have EVER had.  They are incredible.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  Holy cow
* Stopped for vegan ice cream at Coconut Glen's.  Would do again.
* Wandered around Paia and had dinner at the Paia Fish Market again

 Day 6 (Thursday, 3/19)

* This was our last day at Sugar Beach so we just hung out at the beach in front of the condo (I watched March Madness on my phone, much to the chagrin of the missus) and then packed up and headed over to the West side around 11
* For our next few nights we stayed at Napili Kai Beach Resort.  We were going to leave our luggage there and explore the area but our room ended up being ready. 
* We had an Oceanview room over Napili Bay that was breathtaking.  The resort itself was overall very nice, but we had a couple of very minor gripes with it.  The book in the room said snorkel equipment was free, but it was not.  Had to grab some from Snorkel Bob's which was short walk away.  No biggie.  It was aslo unnecessarily complicated to connect to their wifi and we had to talk to the front desk twice to even figure out the password.  Bizarre, but also no biggie. 
* Hung out on the beach at the bay for the afternoon
* Stopped in at Whaler's Village to wander around and shop a little.  Place is a madhouse around dinner time. 
* Wandered over to Maui Brewing for a drink.  Waaaay busier than the Kihei location but it was a great spot to have a drink and watch the sunset
* Headed to dinner at Miso Phat Sushi for dinner.  Loved it
* Grabbed another drink at the Sea House at the resort

 Day 7 (Friday, 3/20)

* Had breakfast at Island Vibes Café which is in walking distance of the resort.  Great acai bowl and coffee
* Hit the beach at Napili again.  Did some snorkeling which was incredible.  Conditions were great for the entirety of our stay in Napili
* Had dinner at Joey's Kitchen.  Another fantastic meal.  The Garlic chicken was heavenly
* Headed back to Whaler's village to grab gelato

 Day 8 (Saturday, 3/21)

* Went for a whale watch with Gemini Charters at 8am.  We saw so many whales, flukes, breaches, and the staff was great
* Had lunch at Fond.  We were the only ones there, but it was solid and reasonably priced
* Hung out back at Napili for the afternoon
* Had dinner at Sea House.  It was fine, but another one that was fairly pricey and didn't blow me away.  Tried to go at Happy Hour but it was a super long wait
* Went and walked the Kapalua coastal trail around sunset.  Walked right past a very A-list celebrity.  I won't dox them outright, but this person got married at the Ritz Carlton Maui, Kapalua several years ago, as I found out when I googled them.  Wanted to say hi but they were walking into Merriman's and didn't want to disturb them.

 Day 9 (Sunday, 3/22)

* Grabbed coffee and acai at Island Vibes again, then hung out at the beach for a very short time
* Drove back to Kihei for some last minute souvenir shopping and grabbed Shave Ice at Ululani's.  It did not disappoint
* Returned car and flew home

 

Mahalo once again!

1jku04c,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jku04c/perspectives_on_espresso_theory_and_science_based/,Perspectives on Espresso theory and science based stuff,"Hi everyone. The point of this post is to share my perspective and ask your about the science/measurable variables in espresso making and what's fundamentally tradition or unfounded belief. 

To add some context, I'm from Colombia, and I'm a chemical engineer. I did a lot of work in my undergrad with unitary operations, specially grinding/milling, granulometry, and solvent extraction. You might see then why espresso interests me. However, we have very little espresso culture here, we are a huge coffee country and have amazing coffee, but it's usually prepared as pourover or percolator.

So I got my first machine, a 200 usd entry one, and started learning about espresso. And there's seems to be a lot of vodoo and ritual about dialing in and preparing the shot. In the work I did, there were few variables to control on an extraction. the solvent was not changing. We could alter the pH, temperature or pressure. we could also alter the time of residency of the solvent on the organic bed. There were different methods that yielded better results in some cases, like fractioning the extraction, or using other advanced and complicated machines that are not really relevant to espresso.

Other than that, we could alter the granulometry of the mill. more fines would improve extraction due to increase of surface area/volume of the bed, but could create clogs or force cracking or channeling in the bed. coarser particles would stabilize the bed, but extraction would be subpar. So we did a lot of sieve granulometry to find good extraction profiles. Sounds familiar?

The issue is, at the end of the day we would get a solution with our extract, be that nicotine, eugenol, or something else, and do two things: Clean it up and purify it as much as possible, and then measure exactly the yield. So we had an objective measure of the success of the process. Espresso brewing seems a lot like this, just that we don't actually know what we are extracting or how much do we want to extract of it. Of course caffeine is part of it, and diluted coffee solids, fatty acids, proteins, oils, and VOCs, and CO2... but we are not optimizing for any of those, but for a specific balance of everything. But what is that balance?

Of course very smart people know this, and general knowledge appears. This is not trying to discredit the valuable research and resources you find online, and the great coffee nerds and baristas do a lot of testing I'm sure. So the term overextracted, and underextracted appear, and tips about what to do to your grinding and your ratios to fix your shot. And I agree that following those lessons has made my shots more enjoyable to me, personally. But the question is, how much of that is bias and placebo because I know the amount of work I'm putting in, and if I see the crema drop like syrup, I expect the shot to be at least pretty good. On the other hand, how much of this has been studied in a controlled context and has at least some science behind it?

**Grinding**  
Is there an ideal granulometry for espresso? Is it bean dependant? is it roast dependant? It's self evident that burr grinders are preferable for consistency, but is there any measurements of the granulometry of a 50usd one vs a 200 usd vs a 2000 usd? where are the diminishing returns?

The RDT water splash seems to reduce static. Why is that something important? It's just about ease of use or does it provide a noticeable difference in the extraction? Is it just to keep the grinder cleaner?

**Portafilter Magic**

It's said a pressurized portafilter creates a different texture to a bottomless one. That's self evident. But also a different flavor. Different how? It's consistently different? Is different worse or just different in this case?

WDT. How is this different or better than shaking the grounds until theyre homogeinized, and then putting them in the portafilter? Is there any measurable difference between using a toothpick/needles/a 2000 usd planetary rotor?

Tamping. Is there an optimal tamping pressure? Why it's supposedly bad to do multiple tamps?

Screen. Is there any measurable benefit to using a screen, or using a specific fancy one vs a cheap one?

**Extraction**

The most important control variable seems to be the grinding. Is there any measurable difference between doing 80-100 celsius, or 20-40 secs? Is there any measurable difference in the product, keeping everything else the same, between a 100 usd/ 250 usd/ 1000/usd 5000usd machine?

  
The thing that has me excited about this hobby is figuring out my own beliefs about these questions. I'm super interested in your opinions, or if there's any science based evidence for any of these. I've just found a lot of ""the shot feels hollow, the flavors seem too wispy, there's a slight something missing"" opinions on different techniques. I do believe those feelings are absolutely valid for the person experiencing them, and finding their perfect shot. But I'm trying to find some more specific ideas to keep trying and learning. 

If you read the huge rant, thanks for your time!

it's been about one month and i need to make a journal entry but i haven't had any thing to talk about until yesterday. So i went to Ponyville to buy some food and other necessities, but when i arrived, there was a massive line for something. I figure that they had to be waiting for something good. Three hours later i learned that i was in line for cider, i bought the last cup and then finished shopping. and then i went back home well, calling it a home is a bit of a overstatement for now it's just a glorified wooden frame. i walked up to Loris, he had just finished building the ""chair mark 27"", i told him about the cider we both drank some this is where my memory gets a little fuzzy. But i do remember there was a massive bang and then a rainbow appeared in the sky, just then i realized what Kat co was going to make, cider.

To make cider we will need a few things. First of all the apples, the cider here is good but not great, It's missing something, i mean it's oddly normal no magic ingredients just plan old apples, and there is a special type of apple that grows here Zap apples they make jam out of them but not cider, the Zap apples would also make the cider rainbow in color nice and exotic. me and Pawlbert should be able to genetically modify them to mature and produce fruit faster allowing for year round supply. actually making the cider may be a problem. I think all we have to to do is wash, grind, juice, filter, and ferment it not very hard. We don't have running water out here but, there is a pond nearby we could just grab some water from there and boil it then we could use it to wash the Zap apples, they sell devices similar to meat grinders  i think there for plants or some other food after all they don't eat meat here, anyways if i could buy one it would probably work. i think i can make something similar to a juicer it can't be that hard to make a juicer compared to something like the Kaiser Moon. second to last filtering i can just buy a colander. and last of all fermenting it, just throw it in a barrel for three weeks and i have a few old coffee filters run the cider throw that and were done.

So the plan is to walk to Sweet Apple acres and buy some Zap apples then go throw the steps listed above. I will write a new entry when the first batch is done or if anything happen before that.

All this talk of cider is making me thirst, any feedback is welcome as always.

I know, Herald Sun. I didn't buy it and I don't often read it... It's a guilty pleasure of mine to enjoy a coffee at my local cafe and scoff at the articles.

Anyway, from the article:

""As Labor prepares to hand down its fourth budget on the ever of a federal election, economists fear there is little political appetite to address the ""inequality"" caused by inflation-driven wage growth pushing some workers into higher tax bands, describing the phenomenon of bracket creep as a major issue.

...

In 2021-22, a full-time worker aged 20 to 24 on the median wage of $57,357 had a net tax bill of $8755.

Projections for this financial year show a workee that age now earns $67,134 while the amount they pay in tax will jump by 3.01 per cent to $12,271"".

So.. extra 10k earnings while paying an extra 3.5k tax... leaves about 6.5k more per year... please, someone explain to me how this is detrimental to the individual? Working the same hours, earning 6.5k more ... I feel like this isn't the damaging report the Coalition thinks it is.. or am I missing something?

Contrary to what the article goes on to report, Australians ARE better off than they were several years ago. You might be paying more in tax but you are absolutely earning more than you were previously.

As to whether or not there should be a reshuffle of tax brackets or raising the cap on lower brackets is somewhat related but irrelevant to the point of the article (or at least how it is worded) which tries to assert you are worse off than you were with regards to wage increases.",1,1743043068.0,AusPol,2,1.0,False

We stayed at the Marriot County Hall for the entire 7-night stay and would highly recommend it. The kids loved that our room had an upstairs reading area that looked over the Thames but they did give us a handicap room so the shower was open to the rest of the bathroom. Anytime the shower was on it sprayed under the shower curtains to cover every inch of the bathroom with water, including the toilet, beneath the sink, etc. With a family of 4 needing the shower the bathroom was never dry, which was kind of annoying but not enough to complain about and request a different room.


Travel day: Left 6:25pm on Virgin Atlantic – meh. Landed 6:50am the next day. Noone really slept on the flight – uh oh.


Day 1: Took Heathrow express then black cab to hotel. After changing we explored then Jurassic high tea at Ampersand Hotel (cab there). Walked a bit to Kensington gardens and then Kensington Palace tour (prebooked). Dinner at Dishoom and then called it a night to reset.

Day 2: Slept in and then Buckingham changing of the Guards at 11:00. The kids then played in the St. James park playground while we got much needed coffee. Surprise parade! Then went to Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese for a pint or two and walked to the Globe for a tour. Dinner at Founder’s Arm’s (great view/great food). We then let the girls have one more night to acclimate and watch their ipads while we enjoyed the Gillray’s bar with their view of the Thames/Big Ben.


Day 3: British museum / Hamleys / Ye old Cheshire cheese again! / St. Paul’s / walked over to see the roman walls and then got a black taxi back to hotel. Wagamama near County Hall for dinner – kids actually loved it! Gillray’s again.


Day 4: Tower of London - used the audio guide / lunch at Giraffe near it – pretty ok-ish / Covent Garden where my kid got drafted into a street performer show for 30 minutes which was one of my highlights / Lion King that night. Amazing.


Day 5: Hired driver to take us to Bath because I’m an idiot and we also thought it’d be nice to see the Cotswold’s. I would have rather taken the train to Bath and enjoyed that for 1/4th of the price of the driver. That being said, the Cotswold’s were really scenic, and I’d love to spend a few days up there just doing nothing.


Day 6: Westminster abbey / let the girls swim at the hotel / went to pub near Wicked about 3.5 hours before showtime and had great curry and good times / Wicked – always great.


Day 7: 6:00am Chunnel to Paris – girls didn’t sleep much since Wicked the night before but they powered through / Taxi to Louvre / walk in park – coffee/hot chocolate – playground. Walk Champs De Elysse to Arc de triomphe – had tickets go up. Didn’t. Wine/pastries/taxi to Eiffel. Up in Eiffel to second floor with English guide – highly recommend – she was amazing and so engaging with our kids. 8:00 Chunnel back to London.

I was always taught to **tamp as hard as possible to ""remove air""**, but I wanted to test if that actually makes sense.

So, I ran an experiment:

* Brewed the same coffee multiple times
* Kept everything identical except tamping pressure
* Used the **10kg clicky tamper** vs. my usual **King Kong-level tamp** (\~30kg+)

The results?  
🔹 The **10kg tamp** produced a balanced shot with good flavor.  
🔹 The **King Kong tamp** led to **overextraction** and even some weird sparkling water effect from the basket during brewing.  
🔹 When I ground finer to find the limit, the **heavy tamp struggled to let water through**, while the **lighter tamp still flowed properly** without channeling.

So… is the ""tamp as hard as you can"" rule actually wrong? 🤷‍♂️ From what I’ve seen, a **lighter, consistent tamp lets you grind finer** while maintaining good flow. Anyone else noticed this?",1,1743042837.0,espresso,4,0.67,False

<div>Transforming your terrace into a stylish retreat is easier than you might think with DIY terrace decor. Utilizing your creative flair, you can design a space that reflects your personality while providing a cozy area for relaxation or entertaining guests.

Start by defining your terrace theme. Whether you prefer bohemian vibes, a modern look, or a rustic feel, choosing a theme will guide your decor decisions. Incorporating elements like fairy lights, colorful cushions, and potted plants can significantly elevate your terrace’s ambiance.

Consider creating a DIY seating area by using recycled pallets or sturdy crates. This not only adds character but also promotes sustainability. Cover them with plush outdoor cushions in vibrant colors to create a welcoming atmosphere. To complement your seating, add a rustic coffee table made from reclaimed wood or a small garden stool for a charming touch.

Lighting plays a crucial role in your terrace decor. Pendant lights or string lights can create a warm, inviting glow as evening approaches. For a more intimate setting, consider using lanterns filled with candles, which add a soft, romantic atmosphere.

Don’t forget about greenery. Plants not only beautify your terrace but also improve air quality. Create a vertical garden using hanging pots or wall-mounted planters for maximum impact without taking up too much space. Herbs planted in small pots can also serve as both decor and a functional element for cooking.

Accessorize your terrace with DIY decor items like painted wooden signs or handmade wall hangings. Upcycling glass jars as vases can add a personalized touch while providing an eco-friendly twist. Incorporate textiles like rugs or throws to enhance comfort and style.

With these DIY terrace decor ideas, you can craft a stunning space that invites relaxation and enjoyment, making your terrace a true extension of your home.

I slowly opened my eyes, grabbed the phone that was resting next to my head, and pressed the snooze button. I then closed my eyes, desperately trying to get another five minutes of sleep. This was the fourth time I had repeated this task, much to the annoyance of the other Marines sleeping in the squad bay.

“Bitch, turn your fucking alarm off, that’s like, the twentieth time.” Groaned Corporal Dawson, lying on the rack next to mine.

“Fourth time; and stop bitching.” I grumbled back. “We’ve all been awake for the past hour anyway.”

I was right; since we’ve been out here on this training exercise, all our sleep schedules have been disturbed, and our bodies’ internal clocks would have us wake up typically an hour before we were supposed to.

My attempt to return to slumber was futile, and I spent the next five minutes staring at the back of my eyelids. Five minutes passed in what felt like two, and once more our one-room living space was filled with the incessant beeping of my alarm, this time joined by three dozen others.

I let out a sigh and crawled out of my sleeping bag, exposing myself to the cold air of the unheated room. I sat up and threw my legs over the side of my rack. I took a second to get my bearings and took in the room.

The dust floating off the concrete floor of the narrow squad bay was illuminated by the bright fluorescent lights that were affixed to the ceiling, the occasional flicker casting the room in dull murkiness. Around me, fresh faced and short haired boots rushed to get dressed, being hurried by tense-faced and booming-voiced Corporals wearing out of regulation mustaches. The terminal Lance Corporals, who had long since stopped caring, lazily emerged from their sleeping bags, content to take their time.

As I got dressed, I asked Dawson about what was on the schedule for training this week, raising my voice to speak over the cacophony of “Move faster!” “Get your rifle!” and “Aye Corporal!”.

“I don’t know, man, according to Sergeant, we’re going to be in cantonment all week, so probably just more of the same” Dawson said as he pulled on his trousers.

Great, I thought. More of the same meant PT, basic knowledge classes, and, worst of all, gun drills. I hated gun drills more than anything else in the whole fucking world. Running back and forth and touching a candy cane in the ground because I couldn’t get the gun up in less than ten seconds all day was not what I was expecting to be doing when I joined the Marine Corps.

I was about to ask him if there were any working parties going on today to see if I could get out of training, when the front door of the squad bay flung open.

“Get the fuck outside right now, we got formation, y’all ain’t new!” Sergeant Federico barked; his face full of its usual malice.

“Aye Sergeant!” The room answered almost in unison.

“It’s too early for this shit.” I mumbled under my breath. I had hoped that Sergeant Federico’s eight-year career as a mortarman would have damaged his hearing to the point where he couldn’t hear what I had said, but I underestimated his auditory detection abilities.

“The fuck you say, bitch?” Sergeant Federico growled, taking a few steps in my direction.

“Er, um uh, nothing Sergeant.” I replied meekly, trying to avoid making eye contact. Sergeant Federico stared daggers at me, the pissed off expression not leaving his face.

“That’s what I thought, bitch” Sergeant Federico said, making an about face and walking out of the room.

“Fucking dumbass.” Dawson said, shaking his head.

“I know right? He’s such an asshole.” I said, my confidence returning to me now that the Sergeant was gone.

“I was talking about you.” Dawson replied.

A few minutes later, me, Dawson, and twenty eight other Marines were standing in columns outside of our squad bay, shivering in the predawn cold. A minute later we were joined by the Marines from section one, who were living in the squad bay right next to ours. A few minutes after that, our platoon sergeant arrived and conducted counts.

“Rifle!” Gunnery Sergeant Richardson shouted in his booming voice. Down the line of Marines, each Marine calling out his number in a similar inflection.

“One!” “Two!” “Three!” Marines called out, going down the line. When it was my turn, I tapped my rifle and called out my respective number, and the count carried on.

“NVGS!” Gunny Richardson bellowed out.

“Take ‘em out! Let me see ‘em!” Sergeant Federico chimed in.

Each Marine held up his pair of Night Vision Goggles and counted. I moved my hand to my waist to grab mine from my NVG pouch that was strapped to my belt. As my hand met the belt, I felt nothing.

“Oh fuck…” I gasped, remembering that I had left my NVG pouch under my rack last night. The count had rapidly gotten to me and when I didn’t say anything, Sergeant Federico was immediately on my case.

“Where are you NVGs?” Sergeant Federico inquired angrily.

“Under my rack, Sergeant!” I replied. The entire formation let out an exasperated groan.

“There ain’t no fuckin’ way!” Sergeant Federico screamed. “Go fucking get them!”

“Aye Sergeant!” I replied quickly, dashing through the formation back into the squad bay. I hastily retrieved my NVGs and returned to my spot in formation. In my peripheral vision, I could see Dawson giving me the side eye. I could tell he was angry, and we both knew what was about to happen.

As soon as formation ended, Sergeant Federico called me over.

“Who’s your squad leader, bitch?” Sergeant Federico screamed, about three inches from my face, his cologne overpowering me more than his yelling.

“Corporal Dawson, Sergeant!” I replied.

“Dawson, get the fuck over here!”

“Aye Sergeant.” Dawson said. He was already standing next to me.

After about twenty minutes of Dawson and me doing a series of grueling exercises while being verbally torn apart by Sergeant Federico, we were finally released when Gunny Richardson saved us. He told the Sergeant that we had had enough, and that we were to go shave, eat chow, and then prepare for that day’s training.

As we were walking to the head, Dawson suddenly stopped and gave me a hard jab on the side of my arm.

“What the hell was that man? You’ve been in the Marine Corps for three years, how the fuck do you forget to grab your NVGs?” Dawson said, his voice filled with hostility.

“I don’t fucking know man, I’m sorry. I took them out of my pouch last night to clean them, which you told me to do by the way.” I replied.

“I also told you to put them back when you were fucking done!” Dawson growled back.

“Look man, I’m sorry, it won’t happen again, I swear.” I said sheepishly.

Dawson sighed and gave me a serious look. He said “Look dude, you being a shitbag was cool when we were boots and I wasn’t your squad leader, but things have changed. I have a lot on my plate now, and I can’t keep getting fucked up for your bullshit.”

Me and Dawson had been together for practically our entire Marine Corps careers. We were in the same platoon on Parris Island, we went to the School of Infantry together, and we eventually hit the fleet together, being sent to the same unit. I’d say we were pretty good friends until a few months back.

To make a long story short, Dawson got promoted, and I didn’t. I honestly can’t say that it wasn’t fair; Dawson was a stellar Marine and well, I wasn’t. When he was studying knowledge and exercising in his free time, I was playing video games and getting drunk in mine. He was sent to advanced school, and I was never even considered. Upon his return he was meritoriously promoted to Corporal. As for me, well, NCO panels were a revolving door for me at that point.

He was made a squad leader, and I was placed in his squad. I was happy about it at first, I thought I would be able to skate out of work and PT, but this unfortunately wasn’t the case. Dawson was a very motivated NCO, and he volunteered our squad for everything. He would also personally PT us every single day. While the rest of our peer group would slink back to their rooms as soon as the Lieutenant and Gunnery Sergeant were gone, Dawson would have us doing hill sprints and burpees at five in the morning.

What didn’t help matters was my attitude. I had always been an asshole, but as soon as I was placed Dawsons squad and had to deal with his moto bullshit, I got a lot worse, and every time I said or did something fucked up, Dawson would be punished for it. Sergeant Federico always hated me, and he hated Dawson for being friends with me, so he was constantly looking for reasons to fuck us up. The past few months have been miserable for us, and it put a strain on our friendship.

Dawson gave me an annoyed look. “Dude, you’re my friend, and nothing will change that, but I can’t keep putting up with your shit. I actually like my job, and if I can’t fix you, Federico’s going to fire me, and I’ll be back doing gun drills with the boots.”

I chuckled. “Boots like me, right?”

Dawson’s expression softened. “I didn’t say that.” Dawson shot back. “All I want for you to do is at least try to be better, for my sake.”

I thought about what he said for a moment. It was true that most of the problems he was going through could be attributed to me and my bullshit, and that he did really enjoy being a squad leader. I looked at him and saw that at this point there was no anger or hostility on his face, just an expression of exasperated desperation.

I sighed. “Okay, okay, you’re right, I’m sorry. I’ve been a shitty marine and an even shittier friend. I’ll do better. I’ll keep my gear on me at all times, I’ll put effort into PT, and I’ll actually try during gun drills today.”

Dawson’s face turned to skepticism. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”

With that, we resumed walking to the head.

After we finished shaving, we left the head and walked to the chow hall. As we were walking in the building, we encountered First Lieutenant Adams.

“Good morning, Sir.” Dawson and I both say in unison.

“What’s up guys!” Lieutenant Adams said with a smile, revealing two rows of perfect, white teeth. “Sergeant Federico told me that you two had some gear retention issues at formation.” His voice was dripping with its usual condescension.

“Yes Sir,” I began. “Dawson and I talked about it and- “

“I think you mean Corporal Dawson.” Lieutenant Adams interrupted.

Me and Dawson exchanged side eyed glances. First Lieutenant Adams was our platoon commander. He was formerly a POG working in admin before he went to the Naval Academy. He was somehow commissioned as an Infantry Officer and was now our OIC. There were rumors that he was transferred to our unit from his last command because of hazing allegations, but I never believed them. He had too much of a stick up his ass to haze anyone.

“Yes Sir. Me and Corporal Dawson talked about it, and we’ve come up with a plan not only to help me retain my gear but also improve myself as a marine as a whole.” I said, barely able to hide the disdain in my voice.

“That’s good news! I’m excited to see the results!” Lieutenant Adams said. With that, he walked past us, exiting the chow hall and walking in the direction of the COC.

“I hate that dude.” I said a few minutes later between mouthfuls of powdered eggs.

“Who doesn’t?” Dawson asked before taking a swig of room temperature coffee.

It was true, very few people in our platoon liked Lieutenant Adams. His methods of leadership and personality left much to be desired. Even Sergeant Federico didn’t like him, but that’s not saying much, because Sergeant Federico typically didn’t like anyone except himself.

We finished our meal and left the chow hall, walking back to our squad bay. Once we got there, Sergeant Federico immediately had us set up our cannon, and we began doing gun drills at the ungodly hour of six AM. An hour passed, and I was running to touch the aiming stake for what felt like the hundredth time, when Lieutenant Adams’s voice pierced through the air.

“Corporal Dawson, get your squad, you guys are going on a working party. Bring your flak and Kevlar.” Lieutenant Adams said, his voice lacking its usual air of superiority.

Thank God, I thought myself. I didn’t know how much more of this I could take. I could tell that Dawson was annoyed; he hated working parties. He saw them as being beneath him. But nonetheless, he instructed me and the two other guys on our gun, (two boots named Henderson and Lewis) to break down the system and stage it inside. We quickly complied and when we finished, we found ourselves standing in front of Lieutenant Adams, awaiting his orders. Sergeant Federico was also there, looking more annoyed than usual.

“You got all your guys here?” Lieutenant Adams asked Dawson.

“Yes Sir!” He replied in a professional tone.

“Do you have all of your gear?” He asked, looking at me.

“Yes Sir!” I said, tapping my rifle and my NVG pouch, this time actually containing them.

“Good.” He said. He then turned to face Sergeant Federico. “Sergeant, take them down to the motorpool. You’ll be briefed on your task when you get there.”

“Sir, can I speak to you in private?” Sergeant Federico asked.

“I believe we already did, Sergeant.” The Lieutenant replied matter of factly. “You *will* accompany them on this working party. Perhaps it will be an opportunity for you to learn how to actually lead people.”

Most of the lower enlisted guys didn’t like Lieutenant Adams because of the constant training he made us do. The NCO’s hated him because of his refusal to consult them in private. If one of the Corporals or Sergeants fucked up, the whole platoon would be witness to Lieutenant Adams publicly berate them. I could tell Sergeant Federico was straining with every fiber of his being to not swing on the Lieutenant. After a few seconds of Sergeant Federico staring daggers at the Lieutenant, he finally responded.

“Yes sir.” He said though gritted teeth. He then turned to us. “Alright assholes, lets fuckin’ go.”

The five of us walked briskly down the gravel road, past the low-lying buildings on either side of the path. Walking a few paces behind Sergeant Federico, I asked him what we’d be doing.

“Why the fuck are you talking to me? Ask your squad leader!” Sergeant Federico barked.

I rolled my eyes and asked Dawson what we would be doing, and when he didn’t know, he asked Sergeant Federico.

“I don’t fuckin’ know. Sir and the other lieutenants got told to give up some marines for a working party this morning at their brief. For all I know, we’re gonna be filling up sandbags or some shit.” Sergeant Federico said bluntly.

I thought back to Lieutenant Adams. He seemed different from his usual smug self when he told us about the working party. Usually when he ordered us to do bitch work, he had an air of superiority around him. This time, he seemed almost concerned.

After a few minutes of walking, we eventually reached our destination. The motorpool was a dirt field usually filled to the brim military vehicles. On this day, however, it was mostly empty, aside from a green 7-Ton and a coyote tan JLTV. Thirty other marines stood milling about, waiting to be told what to do. After ten minutes a white van pulled up, and Lieutenant Adams and a man I didn’t recognize emerged from it.

“Alright guys, bring in it.” First Lieutenant Adams called out in an annoyed sounding voice. Dawson and I chuckled at the Lieutenant being roped into this working party. I could even see Sergeant Federico crack a rare smile. We all started to make our way over to Lieutenant Adams to hear what he had to say. As I approached, I took a second to analyze the man standing next to him.

He appeared to be a middle-aged man, maybe in his late forties. His receding hairline pushed back his graying hair. His face was stern. His piercing blue eyes seemed to bore into me when he looked in my direction. He wore a marine uniform however it lacked name tapes or rank. Based on his age and the fact that he was with Lieutenant Adams I knew he couldn’t have been a private. Whoever this was, he must have been important.

“Okay guys, I’ve got something a little different for you today.” Lieutenant Adams said addressing the crowd.

“Something different?” I whispered to Dawson. “That doesn’t sound good.”

“We’ll be assisting mister…” Lieutenant Adams began, pausing to crane his neck to look at the man’s nonexistent nametapes.

“Jacobs” The man said flatly.

“Mister Jacobs.” Lieutenant Adams continued. “He’s with the…” A look of embarrassment swept across the Lieutenant’s face, and again he turned to Mr. Jacobs, hoping he would provide the name of whatever organization he was a part of.

“That isn’t relevant for today’s test.” Mr. Jacobs said, not even turning to look at the Lieutenant.

Lieutenant Adams looked startled at Mr. Jacobs blunt response. “Uh… right…” The lieutenant said, clearly perturbed by the strange man. “Today we’ll be assisting Mr. Jacobs with a chemical test.”

Chemical test? I thought to myself. What the fuck? I exchanged glances with the Marines to my left and right. I could tell we were all confused by what the Lieutenant had said.

“The fuck you mean, chemical test?” Sergeant Federico called out, not caring if his tone offended Lieutenant Adams or Mr. Jacobs.

Lieutenant Adams shot an annoyed look at the Sergeant. The Lieutenant and the Sergeant had a strained working relationship, and Sergeant Federico having an attitude with him, certainly wasn’t helping.

“Um, uh- it’s a- “The Lieutenant stammered, beginning to show cracks in his composure.

“To be specific” Mr. Jacobs interjected. “It’s a test to determine the effectiveness of a new model of hazmat suit.” If he was bothered by Sergeant Federico’s outburst, he didn’t show it.

“These newer models should prove to be more durable and longer lasting.” He continued. “As well as being less cumbersome to wear.”

“We’re going to go out to the field and spray some CS gas on you guys, that’s the test.” Lieutenant Adams suddenly blurted out, attempting to reestablish himself as the person in charge. “It won’t be that bad, we’ve all done the gas chamber before.”

I raised my hand. “Where are these hazmat suits, Sir?”

As if on cue, a white pickup truck pulls into the motorpool, its bed filled to the brim with rolled up hazmat suits. Soon Henderson and Lewis were standing in the bed of the truck, tossing out the bundled-up hazmat suits to the crowd of Marines surrounding the truck. Henderson tossed me one and I inspected it.

The first thing I noticed was the lack of a camouflage pattern. All of the hazmat suits I had seen in my time in the Marine Corps had the old camouflage pattern from the 1990s. These were a black color. I figured that they lacked camouflage because they were prototypes. The other thing that differed from the hazmat suits I was used to was that this one came entirely in one piece. The other suits I was familiar with came in pieces, the boots, pants, top and gloves were all separate.

As soon as we had all received a suit, we were instructed to put them on. It was much easier to put these suits on compared to the older suits. All we had to do was unzip the back and step into it and then have someone else rezip the back. Mr. Jacobs was right, these suits were easier to wear, mine fit like a glove. After we were all in our suits, Lieutenant Adams started to hand out gas masks. The gas masks were just the standard ones we all were issued.

We all placed our gas masks in the carriers that came with them and waited for our next task. Lieutenant Adams called out, “I need two drivers and two a-drivers!”

Sergeant Federico instantly volunteered me and Dawson. Dawson had a JLTV license, and I had an A-Drivers license. I suspect Sergeant Federico volunteered us because he didn’t want to ride in the back of the 7-Ton with the rest of the Marines. My suspicion was confirmed when he placed himself in the backseat on the JLTV, stating that he would ride with us to make sure we were “driving right.” He was joined in the back by Lieutenant Adams.

We were designated as the lead vehicle, and we took off toward the training area. Lieutenant Adams gave us directions from the back seat. Every few minutes Sergeant Federico would shout at us to speed up or slow down.

“It’s going to be a long drive.” Lieutenant Adams said. “The range is pretty far away.”

“Tell me again what this test is gonna be?” Sergeant Federico asked immediately after shouting at Dawson to keep his eyes on the road.

“It’ll be just like I said at the brief.” Lieutenant Adams said, not taking his eyes off the map that sat in his lap. “We’re going to Range Three-Four-One, and they’re going to spray us with some tear gas.”

“And who are *they* going to be?” Sergeant Federico asked.

The Lieutenant looked up from the map, a puzzled look on his face. After a second, he responded. “Mr. Jacobs didn’t say. I assume there will be some CBRN Marines out there waiting for us.”

The Sergeant didn’t look satisfied by that answer. “Right, and where will Jacobs be during this test?”

“He told me that he would be observing from a distance,” Lieutenant Adams replied. “I’m supposed to radio back the results.”

“This all sounds very strange, Sir.” Dawson said from the driver’s seat.

“Shut up and keep driving.” Sergeant Federico growled.

After about an hour, we finally arrived at Range Three-Four-One. The range was filled with dilapidated multi-story buildings. Back in the day the range was used for urban combat training, but since then newer facilities had been built in different areas of the base, and this one had fallen out of use.

Dawson parked the JLTV near the entrance of the range, the 7-Ton parked parallel to us. Soon after parking, all the Marines had disembarked and began milling around the vehicle. As we exited our vehicle, Lieutenant Adams pulled out his radio and brought it to his face.

“COC, this is Oscar-Two-Alpha, radio check.”

Mr. Jacobs’ voice came through the radio. “Are you in position?”

The officer looked surprised at Mr. Jacobs lack of radio etiquette. “Uh, yes sir, we have arrived at the range. Are there guys on their way to- “

“Order your Marines to stand out in the open and equip their gas masks. The test will begin shortly.” Mr. Jacobs interrupted.

“Yes sir!” he replied. “Everyone, put on your gas masks, and uh, stand over there!” He shouted, pointing at the wide-open space in the center of the range.

Everyone complied with the order, equipping their gas masks and checking them to make sure they were properly sealed. I pulled my mask over my face, wincing as it pulled my hair back. I turned to the Lieutenant to ask him a question.

“So, when will the test start?” I asked.

As if on cue, the air was suddenly filled with the sound of rotors. I looked up to see a black helicopter with no military markings flying low overhead. As it passed over the center of the range, above where most of the Marines were standing, two large, black canisters were dropped from the bottom of the helicopter. The marines ran in every direction so as not to be struck by the barrels. A few seconds after impacting the ground, the canisters began emitting white gas.

“GAS, GAS, GAS!” Several marines cried out.

“What the fuck? Those barrels almost hit them!” Sergeant Federico yelled out; his voice filled with shock rather than its usual anger.

The helicopter quickly sped away, disappearing over the horizon. As the gas dispersed amongst the Marines, several began to cough and gasp for air. They must’ve not properly sealed their masks.

“Oh fuck!” One Marine cried out. “It’s burning my eyes!”

“Tear gas, it’s just tear gas.” The Lieutenant said to himself, watching the scene unfold before him.

After about a minute passed, the tear gas dissipated.  Lieutenant Adams brought the radio back up to his face. “Okay, the gas is gone. Aside from the guys who didn’t seal their masks properly, it looks like the suits work pretty well.”

“Have the Marines remove their masks.” Mr. Jacobs said, speaking through the radio, not acknowledging what the Lieutenant said. “The test has concluded.”

“Hell no!” Sergeant Federico objected. “I’m not taking off my mask, there’s still CS in the air!” He was right, while we couldn’t see it, CS Gas would linger in the air for awhile after being released.

“Fine, you guys can keep your masks on.” The Lieutenant said. Though the gas mask obscured his face, his tone made it clear that he was annoyed, and perhaps, a little scared. Sergeant Federico was a pretty intimidating guy.

“Lieutenant, have the marines removed their gas masks?” Mr. Jacobs said.

“Uh, yes Sir!” Lieutenant Adams replied. After saying that, he then gave the hand signal for all clear and shouted, “All clear, take off your masks!”.

Sergeant Federico wasn’t the only one who was hesitant to remove his mask. While the majority of the Marines began removing their gas masks, gagging as soon as the residual tear gas made contact with their eyes, several called out to Lieutenant Adams.

“Sir, it’s not clear, there’s still CS in the area!” One called out.

“Why don’t you lead by example and take off *your* mask?” Another shouted.

“Shut the hell up!” The Lieutenant snapped back; his anxious tone being replaced by one of anger. “Take off your gas mask or I’ll have you- “

The Lieutenant was cut off by the familiar sound of helicopter rotors approaching. We looked to see the black helicopter flying just as low as before, returning from the direction it had originally departed to. As it flew over us, the side door slid open. From our position by the JLTV, I could see two men wearing hazmat suits identical to ours standing in the open helicopter door.

“They’re making another run!” Sergeant Federico cried out while simultaneously making sure his own mask was still sealed. “Get your masks back on!”

The few dozen Marines who took their masks off fumbled to put them back on, but most weren’t quick enough. The two men inside the helicopter rolled a barrel out of the open door. As soon as the barrel had left the helicopter, the pilot instantly pulled up, wanting to put as much distance between himself and the ground as possible. As soon as the barrel impacted the ground it exploded, a bright red cloud of gas blasted out from the spot of the impact.

The Marines who were within a few meters of the explosion were instantly killed or maimed by shrapnel. I’d consider them the lucky ones. The marines who survived the initial explosion were rapidly enveloped by the red gas. As the gas reached me, I closed my eyes and placed my hand over my mask’s outlet valve and exhaled sharply. I prayed my filters weren’t expired.

I opened my eyes to see that the gas had quickly dissipated, leaving dozens of Marines either doubled over, vomiting, or flailing wildly on the ground screaming. The handful of Marines who had gotten their masks back on in time, or had never taken theirs off to begin with, immediately rushed to aid their compatriots.

A muffled retching sound came from beside me. I turned and saw Dawson lying on his back, convulsing, vomit and mucus running down his neck, bubbling out from his gas mask. His mask must not have been properly sealed.

Upon seeing the state Dawson was in, Sergeant Federico immediately began barking orders.

“Adams, get someone on that fuckin’ radio!” the Sergeant yelled and then turned to me. “Get that damn mask off of him, I’m going to help the others!” Sergeant Federico said as he spun around and dashed to the nearest distressed Marine.

I knelt down next to Dawson and yanked off his mask. His mouth was coated in vomit, and his face was contorted into an expression of pure agony. His bloodshot eyes darted wildly, blinking furiously. His arms were curled at his chest, shaking fiercely.

“Oh shit, oh fuck…” I panted out as I knelt beside my injured friend.

 I tried to recall what our Corpsman had taught us, but they never prepared us for a situation like this. I quickly determined that he wasn’t bleeding, at least externally, and quickly positioned myself behind his head, attempting to clear his airway. As I lowered my head to his chest, I caught a glace of Lieutenant Adams, still standing frozen in place, staring at the mass casualty event before him.

“Sir!” I shouted angrily. He brought his gaze down to me and said nothing, his mouth agape. “The radio! Call for help!”

That finally broke his stupor, and he quickly fumbled to bring the radio to his face.

“COC, this is Oscar-Two-Alpha, stand by for nine-line!” The Lieutenant screamed into the radio.

The radio responded with silence. Growing more frantic, he tried again.

“COC, this is Oscar-Two-Alpha, fucking respond!”

Once again, no reply came through the radio.

Lieutenant Adams shouted into the radio. “COC, Jacobs, anyone- I know you’re listening; God damn it! We need- “

Lieutenant Adams was cut off by the sudden shriek that came from a few meters away. I had never heard a person or animal make a noise like that. It sounded guttural, feral. The two of us turned to see Sergeant Federico, grappling with the Marine he had just been attending to.

“What the hell are you doing?” Sergeant Federico said through gritted teeth as he wrestled the Marine on the ground. “I’m trying to help you!”

“Fuck you! I’ll rip your fucking heart out!” The Marine hissed back.

I was shocked at how much the Sergeant was struggling. Sergeant Federico was a six foot three, two hundred and ten pound mass of solid muscle. This marine was a head shorter and couldn’t have weighed half of what Sergeant Federico weighed. Despite this, the Marine was somehow holding his own against him.

I looked up from the melee in front of me to see a similar scene unfolding across the range. Up and down the field, the marines who had been exposed to the red gas were now attacking their unexposed counterparts. The fighting was vicious.

 I looked in horror as a group of the Unmasked Marines held down a Marine and savagely beat him. The Unmasked all howled in animal rage as they hammered their fists into him. Once he was dead, they dissipated in every direction, looking for new targets.

A gas mask wearing Marine, who had been maimed by the explosion and was lying on the ground, trying to keep his intestines inside of him, let out a desperate cry for help. Unfortunately, one of the Unmasked answered his plea. The Unmasked marched up to the injured marine and without hesitating stomped on the man’s head. Blood, brain matter, and shards of skull burst from the gas mask’s visor. The Unmasked let out a croaky laugh and immediately set out to find a different victim.

I saw Henderson, his face filled with manic rage, dragging a Marine by the leg behind him. Taking a closer look, I realized it was Lewis. Lewis kicked and fought and tried to break free from Henderson’s grasp, but Henderson was too strong. He dragged Lewis into a four-story building. A few minutes later they reappeared on the roof. In a horrific feat of strength, Henderson pressed Lewis above his head and heaved him over. He landed on his neck, dying instantly.

One Marine stood with his back to an old building, surrounded by several of the Unmasked. He held his unloaded rifle like a club and swung wildly whenever one of them tried to approach. One darted up to him, and I could hear the sickening crack of the rifle making impact with its skull from where I was. The Unmasked crumpled to the floor, motionless. I had thought he had killed it when it suddenly sprung back up. The Marine swung his rifle again but this time the Unmasked caught it in one hand and yanked back. The Marine, still holding onto the rifle, was pulled forward and landed on his face in the center of the group. The Unmasked then fell upon him, tearing him apart.

“Oh my God.” said the Lieutenant.

Suddenly, Dawson arms shot up and wrapped themselves around my neck, pulling my head down to his chest.

“What the hell?” I choked out as Dawson’s headlock tightened.

“You fucking bitch. You fucking piece of shit.” Dawson growled into my ear as he strangled me. “You’re gonna fucking die.”

 I started to see stars and my vision began to fade when I heard Dawson let out a pained grunt. His grip loosened and I quickly pulled myself up. I turned to see Lieutenant Adams had broken out of his stupor and had kicked Dawson in the head, freeing me.

“Don’t just stand there, help me restrain him!” The Lieutenant said before Dawson had grabbed his ankle and pulled him off his feet. The Lieutenant had fallen hard on his back, and Dawson was on top of him in an instant. He ripped his gas mask off and tossed it aside. He then began punching the dazed officer in the face, laughing wickedly as he did.

“I want to see your face while I kill you, you college boy piece of shit!” Dawson said as his fist made contact with the Lieutenant’s face. The Lieutenant tried to respond, but the only thing that came out of his mouth was blood and broken teeth.

 I tried to pull Dawson off of the Lieutenant, but an elbow to the face sent me flying back. I sat stunned on the floor, looking for Sergeant Federico. He was the only one at this point who could help the Lieutenant. I turned to see he had finally gotten the Unmasked he was fighting in a choke hold. With a swift motion of his arms, the Unmasked’s head was turned to an odd angle, and it finally fell limp. Sergeant Federico’s victory was short lived, as before he could catch his breath, three more Unmasked pounced on him.

I looked back at Dawson, still beating the Lieutenant’s head in. With every blow, he would list off some grievance he had with the Lieutenant, some of which I never knew he had. Soon, all that was left of Lieutenant Adams’s head was a bloody pile of brains and blood, and Dawson then turned his attention to me, glaring at me with a face full of rage. I then noticed that I was the last Marine still wearing a mask left alive, and all of the Unmasked noticed it too. Thinking quickly, I did something I probably should have done from the start, and sprinted to the JLTV, the Unmasked hot on my heels.

I threw open the door and dove inside. I slammed it shut and engaged the combat locks. I repeated the process with the other three doors. I let out a gasp when Dawson slammed his head into the window and then let out a sigh of relief when it didn’t shatter. The vehicle was quickly swarmed by the Unmasked, all pulling on the doors and banging on the windows, demanding that I get out.

I started the JLTV and waited for the vehicle’s computer to boot up, cursing the modern technology as I sat surrounded by demons. As soon as it was fully booted, an error message was displayed on the screen.

“WARNING: LOW TIRE PRESSURE IN FRONT LEFT TIRE,” the message read.

Confused, I looked out the window to see several of the Unmasked stabbing the tire with rudimentary knives made out of scraps they found around the range. Soon, the computer alerted me that all four tires were experiencing pressure issues.

“Fuck it!” I exclaimed as I put my foot on the gas and sped forward and steered towards the exit. Bad idea. The JLTV only made it a few meters before the front tires exploded, causing the vehicle to go into a spin and roll over. I was thrown around the interior of the vehicle until it finally came to a stop upside down next to the range’s entrance.

I woke up a few minutes later, dazed and bruised, but okay. The vehicle was surrounded by the Unmasked, slamming their fists and rifles into the windows, furiously trying to break in. After a few minutes of this, something strange happened.

Once they realized they weren’t going to be able break in, (the JLTV is practically a tank) they seemed to turn on each other. They set upon each other with the same ferocity and barbarity they had with the other Marines. I closed my eyes and tried to shut out the sounds of death as they murdered each other, but I couldn’t. They screamed at each other in distorted voices. They would shriek about how much they hated each other and how they’ve always wanted to kill one another. This went on for hours.

I’m writing this now on my cell phone as night falls upon Range Three-Four-One. Dawson is the only one left, and he is staring at me through the windshield. Occasionally, he’ll give the window a kick, or yank furiously on the door handle. Sometimes he’ll go on a rant about how much of a piece of shit I am and how I was going to pay for getting him fucked up all the time, but mostly he just stares at me. His bloodshot eyes seem to glow in the darkness. I’ve tried calling for help, but it seems like something is jamming the signal.

I’m not completely alone with Dawson. I can see the helicopter from before, hovering in the sky a few hundred meters away. It’s been there all day. If I had to guess, I’d say that Mr. Jacobs is on board, observing the results of his experiment.

I’m going to try and post this; hopefully, it will go through. If you’re reading this, then I guess it did. Mr. Jacobs, if you’re somehow reading this, fuck you. I hope you burn in hell for what you’ve done here. I hope your experiment was worth it.

The machine features a commercial-style, 360-degree swivel action steam wand, allowing you to create perfectly textured milk.

The peculiar bouquet familiar to places that process hope in numbered slips. Death shifted uncomfortably in a too small chair ill suited for his bony frame. Beside him his scythe leaned against the wall like an old violin in a world that had long forgotten music.

He stared at the dull, industrial gray, threadbare carpet at his feet. It was not merely colorless; it was the absence of color, the absence of anything that dared to draw attention. A carpet designed not to be noticed. A carpet that knew its place.

Despite its lack of aesthetics, he found himself jealous. At least it had a job.

This was his fifth interview in as many months, each attempt more embarrassing than the last, and he wasn’t quite sure how much more he had in him. It had been half a year since the breakthrough life-extension treatment had hit the market. Half a year since his entire business model had been ripped out from under him.

Now, sitting in this pitiful temp agency waiting room, he dreaded getting his number called.

He shifted in his chair again, attempting to fold himself inward, to take up less space, to become, if not invisible, at least ignorable. The others in the room were silent, or pretended to be; flipping through outdated magazines, rubbing at sore knees, studying the walls in an attempt to avoid eye contact. All of them, uneasy passengers adrift on the choppy waters of unemployment.

He cleared his throat, out of habit, not need, and turned to the man seated across from him. The man was dressed in a dark, formal suit, his tie knotted with the sort of precision that suggested muscle memory rather than intention.

“Mortician?” he asked, trying to make conversation with the dour looking man.

The man looked up from the newspaper want ads and turned his sunken eyes towards death. “How could you tell?” he asked in a perfectly dry, monotone voice.

“Like knows like.” Death said nodding solemnly. “And… well, your suit, it…” Death hesitated, suddenly unsure whether he should admit to the man that his suit still had the faint odor of embalming fluid still stubbornly clinging to it like a man on a ventilator clutching at the last threads of life.

A woman’s voice crackled through the overhead speaker, saving him from indecision. “Number 42!”

Death looked down at the crumpled piece of paper in his hands.

“My time is up.” He stood and gave the man a slight nod. “I’ll see you later.” He said.

“No you wont.” The mortician murmured with a slight hint of smugness.

*This is the problem!* Death thought as he made his way to the counter. *No one respects me anymore! I used to be the constant, the conclusion, the final answer to every question the body asked. Now I’m just another name on a clipboard.*

Death approached the counter with the posture of someone expecting bad news but hoping it would be delivered kindly.

The staffing consultant, a blonde in her mid-forties, looked up from her computer with the bland enthusiasm of someone trained in customer service.

“Name?” she asked, fingers poised above the keyboard.

“Death.”

She paused. Not dramatically. Just long enough to process and recalibrate what he had just said. “Is that… first or last?”

“Neither, really. I… predate paperwork…”

She clicked her pen. “Okay. Let’s see what we’ve got for you.” She scrolled through his resume, her expression unreadable. Death sat perfectly still across from her, hands folded, posture patient, he was used to waiting.

“It says here you had some success as a retail manager.”

He nodded once. “Correct. Until—”

“Until you had a breakdown during... Black Friday?”

Death’s patient demeanor cracked slightly, “I don’t know if you’ve ever led a crew of underpaid teenagers and broken adults through the capitalistic ritual that is... that day” he said, suppressing a shudder, “but I’ll be honest, it’s significantly easier to shepherd souls into the afterlife than it is to manage a seasonal shoe department at four in the morning.” He tilted his head slightly, as if caught in a flashback. “… Someone bit me.... For a toaster.”

She nodded, made a small note in the margin, and moved on, scrolling further. “And you applied as a... life coach?”

“Yes.”

She looked up, arching a brow. “Don’t you think that’s a little ironic? Death working as a life coach?”

Death sighed. “Your colleague thought that was funnier than I did. But, I was… am.. desperate.” He adjusted the sleeves of his robe with the dignity of someone unwilling to apologize for practicality. “I thought it made sense with my background in motivational speaking.”

He paused as she raised an eyebrow, inviting him to continue. “Do you see many ghosts wandering around these days?” He didn’t wait for her answer. “Exactly! I was rather persuasive when it came to convincing people their unfinished business wasn’t worth the trouble—that eternal peace was a significantly better bargain.”

He paused, glancing toward the window. “Of course, back then, the concept sold itself.”

She gave a tight, polite smile. Death sat back, composed himself again, preparing for the next indignity.

“Right,” she said, clearing her throat. “Well, we do have an opening at *Death Simulation*. It’s a live-action experience where people pay to confront their fears in a safe, curated environment. It’s a little like, well, an escape room. You’d play… yourself, essentially.”

He blinked. Once. “No.”

“It’s not a bad gig.” She pressed. “Flexible hours. You get to keep the robe!”

“I will always keep the robe….”

She gave a tight, practiced smile and resumed scrolling. He waited. “Anything else?”

The clacking slowed, then stopped.

“No. I’m sorry. The rest of the open roles have all been taken—mostly by former life insurance reps, hospice nurses, a couple of morticians retrained in dental hygiene…”

She tapped her keyboard softly. The silence between them hummed with the soft fluorescent buzz of economic extinction. “You can always check back in a week,” she said gently. “Positions aren’t constant.”

She paused, then added with a weak laugh: “The only constants are dea—well…” She caught herself, a little embarrassed. “Not death anymore. But taxes, still are.”

Death stood in his new office, It was clean, pristine, untouched. A single fern sat in the corner, overwatered and underloved, striving to appear lively beneath the pale indifference of oppressive LED light.

The sign above the reception desk read, in proud serif font:

*GRIM & ASSOCIATES — TAX PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING*

Death stood behind the counter in a tailored charcoal suit, no trace of the robe, his scythe replaced with a new BIC red ink pen. He checked and adjusted his slim black tie in the window’s reflection and stood straighter, adjusting his posture to that of someone who had, at last, found a use for inevitability.

If he could no longer close the books on souls, he could at least balance them.

The bell above the door chimed as a client stepped in. Death smiled, calm and measured, entirely professional. *My first customer!*

“Welcome to Grim & Associates,” he said, extending a hand with the quiet confidence of someone who had reinvented himself. “We’re going to kill the tax code.”",2,1743041297.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1jkt9tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CigarReview/comments/1jkt9tm/journey_through_smoke_my_father_connecticut_toro/,Journey Through Smoke: My Father Connecticut Toro Gordo Review,"There's something magical about the first moment you hold a truly exceptional cigar. The weight, the texture, the promise of an experience waiting to unfold. The My Father Connecticut Toro Gordo offers that magic in spades, and what follows is my journey through its layers of complexity and craftsmanship.

# First Impressions

The Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper gleams with a silky, golden-brown hue that practically whispers of the care taken in its cultivation. Don Pepin Garcia's reputation for immaculate construction is immediately evident - firm but not hard, with just the right amount of give when gently squeezed.

The pre-light draw offers hints of cedar and cream with a subtle sweetness that teases what's to come. And then, the moment of truth - the first light.

# First Third: Awakening

The initial puffs reveal a wonderful creamy nuttiness that coats the palate without overwhelming it. This isn't your grandfather's mild Connecticut wrapper. The Garcia family has managed to create something that maintains the characteristic smoothness of Connecticut leaf while introducing their signature complexity.

The smoke is plentiful and aromatic, creating clouds that linger just long enough to appreciate their density before dissipating. The ash holds firmly - a testament to the impeccable construction that makes My Father cigars so renowned.

# Middle Third: Development

As I progress into the middle third, the cigar begins to tell a more nuanced story. The cream and nuts remain, but now they're joined by gentle spice notes of clove and cinnamon that dance across the palate. There's an intriguing note of sunflower seeds that emerges unexpectedly, adding another dimension to the experience.

Coffee notes begin developing on the finish, lingering pleasantly after each exhale. The mouthfeel remains silky and smooth without being overpowering - a perfect balance of presence and restraint.

I've paired this journey with coffee enhanced with bourbon and Irish cream, creating complementary rather than contrasting flavors. The bourbon's caramel notes enhance the developing spices while the Irish cream mirrors the cigar's silky mouthfeel - a harmony of flavors that elevates both experiences.

The ash continues to hold impressively, having only dropped once well into the smoke. Such construction speaks volumes about the care taken at the My Father factory in Esteli.

# Final Third: Culmination

The final third is where many cigars falter, but the My Father Connecticut shines brightest here. Leather notes emerge alongside minor cacao with a hint of bitterness that perfectly balances the sweetness. The clove spice brightens considerably, while the coffee deepens toward rich espresso.

Despite the inevitable warming of the draw, the cigar maintains its dignity and composure. The white pepper notes become more pronounced, offering staccato punches that break up the creaminess without overwhelming it. The mouth still feels remarkably clean between puffs - no cloying bitterness, just pure, evolving flavor.

What's particularly impressive is how the profile shifts from bitter espresso toward sweeter chocolate cocoa notes in the final moments. The sweetness develops beautifully, creating a finale that's both satisfying and memorable.

# The Farewell

Finishing this cigar was like receiving a firm handshake from a friend you don't know when you'll see again - full of warmth, appreciation, and anticipation for the next meeting. That bittersweet moment of conclusion carries the emotional weight that only truly exceptional cigars can deliver.

The My Father Connecticut Toro Gordo isn't just a smoke; it's a journey through the Garcia family's heritage and expertise. From the first light to the final puff, it tells a story of tobacco craftsmanship that few can match.

While it sits in the ""something nice"" category price-wise (typically $10-15), it delivers an experience worthy of cigars twice its price. It may not be an everyday smoke for most, but it certainly deserves a place in any aficionado's rotation for those moments when you want to experience Connecticut wrapper at its finest.

For those who typically dismiss Connecticut-wrapped cigars as too mild or one-dimensional, the My Father Connecticut serves as a masterclass in what's possible when traditional styles meet innovative blending. The Garcia family has created something that respects tradition while pushing boundaries - much like the best artisans in any field.

After three years of side development, I've finally released my app!

I created [Newsreadeck](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsreadeck/id1593025917) because I love starting my day with coffee and the news from various sources. However, each article came with an onslaught of ads.

I tried using RSS feeds, but many websites lack them. Creating or finding one manually was tedious. Plus, RSS feeds often just opened the article in a web browser or displayed only a snippet, not the full content.

To solve these problems, I developed my own data sources, compiling over 16,000 curated sources categorized by language, location, and topic. I monitor them for reliability. The app lets you discover and follow sources without limits and access articles seamlessly. I also built a custom reader to eliminate ads, banners, and distractions, although some paywalls might still appear.

If you enjoy reading the news, feel free to download the app. Any feedback is welcome. 

I plan to release a new version with more features every month 🤞.",3,1743041147.0,SideProject,1,1.0,False

It said it was first detected around 7:15 am and last detected at 5:18pm (roughly when i left for my friend's house) It seemed to possibly show an active location with this alert which was around my apartment complex but it didn't seem to follow me to my friends house and when i clicked play sound by my car there it said that it couldn't connect.
So could it be someone who lives in my apartment complex that has an airtag that made it go off and its just a coincidence or how does it work?

Author's Note:  
I've been busy IRL, also this chapter felt tricky for me to write because I wanna give everyone something to do besides being wallflowers. Lemme know if there are any continuity errors.

**Story So Far:**

* *The Whales enter a completely different Rift-World from what the other scouts have described.*
* *Siria, instead of being blamed by Ingrid reacts with joy, believing that the Whales must have been 'worthy' to have been brought there.*
* *An encounter with a horde of infected creatures known as worm-heads ends with the Whales victorious and the monsters routed.*
* *As they press onwards, Ingrid finds the world they're in a little too familiar...*

\_\_\_

“So, does this place look familiar?” Iohann asked as they crossed the last stretch of lawn.

“The exact place? No, but as what kind of place we are, it’s a suburb.” Cecil replied, still scanning the windows and rooftops for any possible shooters. “That means there’s only houses here and the occasional church or school. For buying food and supplies you’ll need to drive out a few miles out to get them.”

“I doubt we’ll find them.” Iohann remarked “If the townsfolk evacuated it stands to reason the merchants would have fled alongside them.”

“*We’ll need to find vehicles...*” Zefir suggested, “*If you guys are planning to ransack a Walmart, would be worth it for our villagers at the very least…*”

“K-Mart” Neith corrected him “also Costco would be ubiquitous here.”

“*Right…*” Zefir continued “*Those places are going to take hours to reach on foot, it’s best you guys either commandeer some working vehicles you can find there, or alternatively, double back here and get the ATV. What’s the verdict, Starchaser Actual?”*

“We take what we can from this house.” Ingrid replied “Then we locate the turnpike that leads us out of this suburb. If we find vehicles along the way we will commandeer those, if not, we turn back and fetch the ATV. Raiding a couple of gun stores wouldn’t hurt either… but I suspect those are amongst the most likely picked clean by looters already…”

 

The mist seemed to thin as the party approached the house. It was a two-storey structure like all the rest. It had slate-gray roofs, red brick walls for the first floor and cream-colored wooden boards everywhere else. The first floor had bay windows with most of them having the curtains drawn. The pair of windows that flanked the backdoor however, were not.

\[“**Obscure Scrying**”\] Viel said, pointing her staff at the house. The windows briefly shimmered.

“That will prevent anyone from seeing clearly through the windows.” Viel explained as she jogged along. “It heavily distorts the light passing through the glass, making it quite an eyesore to look at.”

“Good thinking, Viel!” Ingrid snickered, her smile however turned to a thoughtful look as she noted the cars she passed by, “Neith, get me the model of those cars.”

“Standby, this will take a bit considering they’re completely totalled.” Neith said as she launched her Falcis drone to scan the destroyed vehicles.

At the same time, Ingrid pointed to two trees that stood on either side of the backyard.

""Montessa, Aviz."" Ingrid said, ""Get me eyes up on those trees.""

The mice squeaked in assent and skittered up their branches. Their predatory instincts allowing them to climb quickly and silently, with not a single branch rustling despite the fact that six armored and heavily armed dog-sized mice ran up the trunks of these trees.

“Lakota, get me eyes on the second floor windows.” Cecil added quietly. The secondary big portal hovered up, guns trained on the windows. Sharpshooter mice Orlando and Owen activated their sights’ infrared but saw nothing, prompting the driver Rykard to let out a series of small squeaks to signal an “All clear.”

 

“Those wagons…” Iohann noted as the team passed by the stomped-on cars, “The ATV had me expecting the common form of transport to be much bigger, but these look like they can carry only a handful of passengers.”

“Three to five, I reckon.” Kinu said, noting the size of the cars.

“They are.” Philia replied, recognizing one as a flattened Toyota Corolla. “Our ATV is an exception, it’s huge because it needs to be able to travel across rugged terrain and carry many people and supplies. These cars are for use within paved roads, few if any of them are fit for travelling on wild soil.”

“I’d like to travel on these some day…” Sammy laughed, wondering how they looked in their pristine condition.

“You’ll probably like some models.” Cecil said as he flew along, keeping an eye on the ground-floor bay windows. “Some can run across roads really fast, we have sports where people race specially built cars.”

“The *Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut*,” Neith said as she wheeled along. “Reaching five-hundred and thirty-one kilometers per hour.”

“Could you put it in something understandable?” Siria said, “I’m not familiar with these units of measurement, like say paces.”

“Of course,” Neith replied ”In one second that car at top speed could clear about a hundred and forty-seven and a half meters per second or…. The length of eighty-four paces.”

“What about the fastest horse on Earth?” Viel suggested “that way we can get some reference.”

“In comparison, the fastest horse on Earth was recorded at a top speed of seventy-two and three quarters of a kilometer per hour. That’s sixty-four and a half meters per second or thirty-seven paces.” Neith replied.

“So more or less the fastest horse is three times slower than the fastest car.” Sammy murmured thoughtfully.

“Well don’t get your hopes up, I doubt we can find a car of that caliber here.” Neith said placatingly. “At most we’ll probably have to settle for something around half that speed.”

“Ingrid once drove a Shelby Cobra.” Philia chuckled. “We call it a *muscle car* since its engine was meant for pulling loads much larger and heavier than the car’s own body.”

“It has a maximum speed of two-hundred and ninety kilometers per hour. That’s eighty meters per second or about sixty paces a second.” Neith said quickly.

“So Ingrid’s old metal steed runs about more than twice as fast as the fastest horse, but half the speed of that Konig-car.” Sammy said.

“Mhmm…” Ingrid murmured proudly “I love that car. I bet it’s in a museum somewhere now, being the vehicle of a fallen hero it’s probably become too priceless to sell…”

 

The backyard's grass was only slightly overgrown, which seemed to say that it had only been a few days since the worm-head onslaught had begun. A wooden patio led up to the house, where some of the wicker outdoor furniture had been knocked down. Ingrid smiled as she saw fireteam Santiago's leader, Gerard, poke one of the garden gnomes with this glaive. The golden Tixi mouse chittered in relief, seeing that it was only a statue before skittering over to join the rest of his team that took stations by the edge of the patio, peering over with their guns at the ready.

“Ermm…” Ingrid smiled as she saw Cuddly run up a lone sunflower, its leaves had been completely pruned and its head was drooping, no doubt the house’s occupants were in the middle of taking its seeds. The adorable Fae Marsh Hare quickly nibbled at its stem, causing it to fall over and allowing the cuddly hare to start nibbling away at the many seeds.

Ingrid walked up the patio along with Cecil, noting that it was only lightly strewn with dry leaves. Fireteams Montessa and Aviz continued to make short quiet squeaks every minute over the radio to let her know the coast is clear.

A screen door stood ajar, which would have insulated the household from bugs or probably the occasional racoon while allowing fresh air to come in. Or at least it would have, except that the backdoor was closed. Looking up, Ingrid saw that the spring that would have kept the screen door shut was not snapped off but simply unhooked.

Before Ingrid could try the door, she heard the crinkling of paper and leaves as Cecil picked up a newspaper. It was lying near one of the patio sofas.

""The Lakeview Tribune..."" the slime read aloud, the paper wasn't yellowed at all, it looked like it was only printed a few days ago. ""Saturday, August 10, 1991... Ingrid, this looks recent!""

Philia turned to Neith ""Get me what you can from the Lakeview Tribune...""

""Got it."" Neith replied quickly. ""It's a community newspaper catering to suburbs near Chicago, Illinois. It's headquartered in Downtown Chicago.""

*“Woohoo! Send me back some deep dish pizza!”* Zefir cried. *“Also, that answers the Nike shoes.”* Zefir quipped.

“That’s an A-firm, Baseplate.” Philia replied.

“So where is this Illinoy place?” Selphie inquired, crowding in with Siria, Viel, and Iohann who were reading the paper along with Cecil.

“Somewhere in the middle of the United States.” Cecil explained, adjusting his hold of the newspaper so everyone could sidle up to him and read along, “There's a huge lake north-east of here, so big it’s a sea of its own.”

""I suppose that that answers our question of where in the United States we are."" Kvaris said.

 

“Also WHEN we are.” Ingrid said.

There were confused looks as everyone looked at her.

""I'm..."" Siria began hesitatingly, ""I'm sure I heard you right.""

""I did."" Ingrid replied matter-of-factly, her expression looked like she had said something more conventional like the sun rising from the east. She glanced at the newspaper, noting that it looked like it was still fresh off of the press.

“When we are?” Iohann repeated.

“Girls, we’ve travelled backwards in time. We’re in the past.” Ingrid said flatly. Not surprisingly everyone except the earthlings quickly erupted in disbelief at a statement that she probably guessed was… in their words “cone hat”.

There was a clattering sound as Siria’s staff dropped to the floor.

“Boo!” Neith said, playing a sound clip of an audience booing “Time travel is laaaaaame!”

""EXCUSE ME!?"" Siria looked up at her in surprise. She was sure the Nemesis-Stalker did not misspeak, nor was she worried of attracting any undue attention as Viel and Iohann had already recast their \[Muffling\] and \[Slow Arrow\] spells respectively.

Viel too looked up to Ingrid, wide-eyed at her bold declaration. She glanced at Cecil who seemed unmoved, yet not disapproving.

“She’s right.” Cecil said, turning the page of the newspaper to read more of the local happenings of August 10th. ""The year nineteen-ninety one, or rather, year one-thousand nine-hundred and ninety-one is decades behind the era we lived in. Ingrid, Philia, and Zefir's parents in this era at most, would still be children if they were even born at all… oh look,it’s even got a Mr. Coffee ad.""

“Philia?” Peanut squeaked.

“Yup. It’s true.” Philia said, glomping the little mushroom, who made adorable squee’ing sounds.

Siria glanced at the ex-princess then at Neith, neither made any dissent towards the Nemesis-Stalker’s absurd but seemingly convincing observation. Even the latter’s playful heckling; as if watching a play that resorted to a hated trope, served only to affirm rather than refute.

Zefir followed suit.

*“We’ve got to go back, Marty!”* Zefir said, for some reason imitating an old man’s voice *“Go back to the future!”*

“Ahhh geez, doc!” Ingrid replied, warbling her voice to a comic degree.

 

""How?"" Viel spoke Siria's unasked question. “What you’re saying is quite absurd, Ingrid…how can you be so sure?”

Ingrid pointed at the newspaper that Cecil was reading, prompting Viel and Siria to come over for a look. ""That newspaper’s proof enough. 1991 is decades ago and that paper hasn’t yellowed at all. Even the sound Cecil made while opening it up is still crisp, sounds like it came off the printing press only recently.”

“Maybe someone just had it stored away and decided to take it out for a read before everyone left.” Kvaris suggested. She had walked off to the right-hand of the backyard and towards a small shed nearby. Opening it up while two of the Kiowa mice covered her, she saw an assortment of containers inside, along with some tools hanging off of the inside of the door, though she only recognized a few hammers, saws, and an axe.

“*Anubis found a tool shed. Take what’s inside.*” Zefir said quietly over the radio.

“Lakota, come over and assist please.” Cecil said, without looking up, still engrossed in his newspaper. At once, the big portal hovered down and the mice quickly put away their guns to assist Kvaris with bringing in the goods.

“Kvaris, what you’re suggesting is impossible.” Philia said as she and Peanut hurried over to help her bring in the shed’s contents into Lakota’s portal. As she turned around, she chuckled as she saw Johnny wiggle over to the bird-feeder, the jolly pumpkin reached out a tendril and snatched the container from the perch, crushing it with his tough ironwood-like vines while opening his mouth to let all the seeds spill into his hungry maw.

“We’re talking about decades here,” the ex-princess continued “,even if the homeowner here had a hobby of archiving newspapers, he would have had a controlled environment to preserve them with and never take them out of it. Once exposed to the outside air and sunlight, even a well-preserved paper like this would begin to rapidly deteriorate considering how long ago it was made.” The ex-princess continued with her explanation.

“Don’t forget that compared to most books,” Ingrid added “Newspaper material isn’t built to last that long. It’s usually made of cheaper, easily mass-produceable pulp.”

 

""I've finished a scan of the crushed cars."" Neith added, her drone returning back to its charging dock. ""Their model is consistent with those constructed in this era. Toyota Corollas, Ford Mustangs, and Chevy Impalas. All these models' debut ranges are from 1984 to 1991.""

“*Most people today are too stupid to drive in manual.*” Zefir added, “*Meaning, nobody in our era- with exceptions like myself of course, could even operate those vehicles without crashing into things every ten feet.*”

“My Shelby Cobra’s manual, by the way,” Ingrid announced grandly “like a real car should be.”

At that, Cecil looked up as Ingrid raised her hand, smacking her hand to Cecil’s tendril in approval.

“Yeah! Real Cars!” Cecil laughed, before returning to his newspaper.

“Also,” Ingrid pointed up at a pole that was pinned to the outer wall of the house. Atop it looked like a big shallow collander that was slanted at an angle, a spike with prongs jutting out sideways emerged from this enigmatic totem. “That’s a really old-school satellite dish. We don’t use those anymore and would’ve been considered an eyesore and taken down in our era. Unless we’re out in the boonies which I doubt.”

“*She means to say you guys are close to a major city, probably a few miles give or take, and not in some remote, underdeveloped town.*” Zefir explained “*Therefore unsightly, outdated things would’ve had no justification marring anyone’s house. America’s pretty big in trying to look nice when around each other, houses being no exception.*”

“It’s not even rusted.” Ingrid said with a shrug of her shoulders, letting out an amused snort as she saw Johnny pick up a bag of fertilizer and devour it whole. Meanwhile Cuddly ""ermmm’d"" cutely as he picked flowers from the flowerbed and tried eating them. The rest of the sunflower head he had deposited into the Lester’s portal for the rest of the Kiowa mice to eat.

 

“I… ummm… it’s just…” Siria was trying to form words, totally flabbergasted. She knew Ingrid was smarter than she let on; she had that cunning about her and a generous amount of resourcefulness, but this was far more than she could have expected to hear from her.

“It’s not a stretch of the imagination, considering what’s all around us, Siria.” Ingrid shrugged.

“If you want a stretch of the imagination,” Cecil remarked “The August weather is all wrong. Though I suppose that has something to do with the Ether Quartz here...”

""Wrong in what way?"" Peanut asked, making cute squee'ing sounds as Philia patted her soft velvety cap before getting back to work transferring the contents of the tool shed into Lakota’s portal.

""It’s foggy and cold.” Philia said quickly “Normally, it should be two months into the summer season. Ergo, it should be quite warm right now.""

Cecil turned the page before speaking, “This silence is pretty eerie as well. I guess the worm-heads spooked all the wildlife you’d expect to see in a suburban neighborhood like this. They’re probably in hiding because they’re fair game on their menu.”

“Agreed, also.” Philia said, flicking her thumb at the bird-feeder, “that bird-feeder Johnny gobbled up was untouched. Should’ve seen squirrels and raccoons feasting on them. Even the garbage is left alone.”

“Are those creatures familiars?” Selphie inquired, realizing what those fixtures were.

“No, they’re wild animals…” Ingrid replied quickly, taking out her smartphone and still finding a “No Signal” message. Neith was still not picking up anything.

“Do people on Earth just feed any wild animal they come across?” Sammy laughed.

“Why not?” Ingrid said “It doesn’t hurt to share with the wildlife that live among us, within reason of course.”

“So that’s why you’re so friendly to all creatures you see…” Kvaris snickered, coming over to inspect a stack of abandoned sacks.

“Where’s this garbage you speak of?” Selphie asked, she didn’t see any pile of refuse around “This place looks clean.”

“There.” Philia pointed to a stack of black garbage bags which were bulging. “There aren’t even flies around it. It should’ve been torn open by scavengers already.”

Kvaris’ hand froze, as she was crouching in front of it and was about to try to open it up. “So that’s what it was.” she mumbled, standing up.

\_\_\_

 

*A stretch of the imagination indeed!* Siria thought to herself. It was amazing how Ingrid could have even grasped the very concept of going against the flow of time. A scholarly concept that only the most learned, but eccentric and borderline cone hat sages would have ever entertained. She herself had only heard about it once. About three hundred years ago, in a posh city where esteemed magi gathered, and only after some heavy drinking in an out-of-the-way tavern what was the favorite haunt of said eccentric individuals.

“The concept of time-travel is not even considered strange by terran standards.” Neith said, “That’s like a common folk-tale told around the fire here. As a matter of fact it’s a pretty common trope now more than it was a hundred years ago thanks to the advancements in technology.”

“You boo’ed the idea, why?” Siria asked.

“Because a lot of them use time-travel as a means to an end and therefore the science behind it is not accurate and sometimes contradictory.” Neith replied matter-of-factly “Which even for an AI like myself could forgive, if the crux of the story wasn’t such a bore to begin with.”

“You could get bored?” the elf looked at the spider-bot questioningly

“I can measure microseconds, Siria.” Neith said “That’s a million before you can count one second.”

 

""Here’s a time-travel story that is well-known: Rip Van Winkle"" Philia began, heading over to Ingrid as Peanut and Kvaris brought in the last few containers into the portal.

“Oooh, classic piece of literature!” Cecil called out, pointing to her.

“Written by Washington Irving and published in the year one-thousand eight-hundred and nineteen, or… as we call it, year eighteen-nineteen. That’s nearly two-hundred years ago from 1991 by the way…it’s a story of a man who had gone into some Fae mountain on a stroll, only to realize upon returning that he had been transported twenty years into the future.""

The team looked at her in silence; that Philia was able to immediately recall and summarize that story said a lot about how ubiquitous the concept was.

Philia didn’t notice however, as she was cautiously peering through the bay windows, finding inside a kitchen that looked like it was inspired from the *The Brady Bunch*, the earthy brick wall accents might have looked timeless, but the orange counters and backsplash, and avocado accents and chairs made it look like she was looking into a diorama in a sitcom museum than an actual house in the Illinois suburbs. Peanut hovered by the opposite side of the window, her form slightly distorted as she spread her body mass into a loose cloud of spores to negate any hostile projectiles that may break through the window. Neither could see anyone lurking inside, breathing a sigh of relief.

 

“*There’s also ‘A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court’*,” Zefir added, pausing for Philia to give the date.

“Written in eighteen eighty-nine by Mark Twain, also a long time ago.” Philia interjected, there was no worry of anyone lurking inside to hear her voice despite her being close to the windows, thanks to Viel’s \[**Muffling Spell**\] muting her voice to anyone inside. She tried the windows but they wouldn’t open.

“Oh that’s one’s a veeeeery familiar story.” Cecil said in a sing-song voice, going back to his paper.

“What do you mean?” Iohann queried.

“It’s literally our story right now, take it away, Baseplate!” the slime said.

“*Sure.*” Zefir continued. “*It’s about a man who had found himself hundreds of years in the past, bringing forth his knowledge of…at the time, modern tools.*”

“I get it now.” Iohann said. “Like Autumnhollow and your guns.”

“Precisely.” Cecil winked.

“And then there’s more contemporary works, like ‘Back to the Future’ which premiered in…?” Ingrid paused so Philia could give the date, which she didn’t know.

“Nineteen eighty-five. Six years ago since we’re currently in nineteen ninety-one.” Philia chimed in, trying the other window and finding also locked shut.

“Which brings up another anomaly we’re facing right now.” Ingrid said, as she hopped off the patio, crouching behind the mice positioned behind it and lovingly giving the cuddly rodents cheek rubs. As she did so, the mice closed their eyes in bliss and made happy chittering sounds.

“The story of *Back of the Future*…” she continued as she lavished the mice with attention ”...is about a boy who travels back in the past, and due to his interference with the course of history, he almost ends up erasing his own existence.”

The team paused, looking at her in silence, wondering what sort of grave dilemma they were in.

“The Grandfather Paradox,” Ingrid explained, her eyes closed in bliss as the mice she was cheek rubbing let out small happy squeaks. “Let's say you end up back in the past and meet your grandfather as a little boy. You kill this boy, what do you think happens?""

""Ermmm..."" Cuddly murmured happily, pulling up a carrot from the ground. The Fae Marsh Hare waved his wand to dislodge all dirt and soil to clean the root crop before chewing on it.

""What's a paradox?"" Selphie asked, not familiar with the term. She made cute dryad noises as Iohann affectionately ruffled her hair.

""It is something that is contradictory to its own nature, yet is."" Iohann explained.

Sammy's reply was quick, despite never having heard of this concept before, The Kiowa mice had taken up position near her to help watch the team’s rear. Taking Ingrid’s example, she reached into the portals and gave the mouse manning it loving pats, making them chirp contentedly while they maintained her vigil.

""If you killed your grandfather before he could leave behind any descendants, then you would undo your own existence, as there would have been no forebears to bring you into the world.""

“That’s correct in a way.” Ingrid said, straightening up as she pampered the last of fireteam Santiago, she had even jumped up to Neith’s back to rub Riker’s cheeks, eliciting squeaks of delight.

Viel's eyes were twinkling with interest at this peculiar, but fascinating puzzle (as well as the adorable sight) ""Wait, something's wrong... any actions performed in the past should have already affected your present...""

""Huh..."" Sammy shrugged, reevaluating her response. ""Then it's impossible. You've already killed your grandfather in the past, therefore there was no way you would have been born, much less return to that moment in time..."" the orc frowned as she realized the conflicting nature of the situation.

""How could you have gone back in the past to kill your grandfather, if there was already a 'you' that performed that deed back when he was a boy,"" Kinu pondered, voicing what Sammy was thinking.

""...and therefore preventing him from having descendants and thus making your birth, therefore your own existence an impossibility?""

""Are you saying if we act carelessly here,"" Kvaris postulated ""We could undo your own existence?""

""The opposite actually."" Ingrid replied, beaming as she confidently put her hands on her hips. ""Nothing we do has any bearing on my, Cecil, Philia, and Zefir's existence.""

Siria was quiet, watching everyone else's reaction. A thought slithered at the back of her mind that seemed to offer an answer to this question but it evaded her attempt to enunciate it into words.

""What makes you think there will be no repercussions?"" Peanut squeaked, ""You yourself presented this paradox of someone undoing their own existence by interfering with history!""

Ingrid wagged her finger ""Tsk, tsk, tsk... therein lies the fallacy. You see, the scenario as presented in *Back to the Future* can’t happen. Let's review the paradox again. You DID meet your grandfather as a child and murdered him. That cannot happen if he was your very grandfather from your own timeline, given the contradictions you've all discerned. Therefore, the boy you're looking at as well as the past you've found yourself in is not your own. Ergo, you've travelled to an alternate world. Which is what we are in right now.""

The other girls except Philia looked at Siria for confirmation; rather than readily refute Ingrid’s analysis the elf looked lost in her thoughts, as if suddenly having revelation.

“A timeline, huh?” Kinu said “And you say there’s more than one.”

Ingrid walked up to Selphie and gently traced her finger over her branches. The dryad giggled at her touch.

“Some of the top scientists of this world believe that time doesn’t exist as a single thread, but like Selphie’s antlers, diverges and branches out. When we take one choice, Time takes both. Therefore, going back to our Grandfather Paradox, the moment you’ve traveled to meet your grandpa as a boy, you’ve actually gone to a different timeline. Killing him will not undo your existence.”

Ingrid paused to run her hands through Selphie’s hair, the little dryad closed her eyes and pressed her head against Ingrid.

“We’re inside an alternate timeline right now, and I have proof.” Ingrid continued, tapping her temple with her finger before resuming giving Selphie her head pats. “None of us earthlings know of this event. Chicago, Illinois was an important city in the United States of America in 1991. Culturally, socially, and economically. Also, the Gulf War is taking place right now…”

“Hate to break it up to you Ingrid…” Cecil said, lowering his newspaper so he could look up to her. “But I’ve already gotten past the headlines and editorial and there’s not a single mention of Kuwait, Saddam, or oil for that matter… it’s like the Gulf War never happened in this timeline.”

“Welp, there we go, more proof we’re on our Earth.” Ingrid said as the slime resumed reading the paper. “See? We know about that event despite the fact that we’re in an era where our parents are still toddlers.” Ingrid paused for a bit. “Also, an attack on American soil of this magnitude, and on such an important city would become a talking point for generations to come, I bet even my great grand-kids would grow up still hearing adults talking about it then.”

“Also, this was and still is the most powerful country on Earth in terms of military power.” Philia added, “The last country that dared attack American soil was brutalized with two nuclear bombs. The thought that anyone or anything would have the audacity to do that again would have provoked widespread fury that would be passed down for generations as well.”

“...you mean those bombs that tear apart the very fabric of reality?” Peanut squeaked in query, remembering mention of nuclear power.

“The same.” Ingrid said. “What I’m trying to say is that there’s no way this could have been swept under the rug and forgotten in a few years. As a matter of fact, ten years from now, two…” Ingrid held up two fingers for emphasis “...and I mean just two towers were felled by foreign entities in New York City, a far more important city in this country and that is still a sore point despite it taking place decades ago.”

“A world like our own, but with only a couple of differences…” Iohann thought aloud “I wonder what this mirror of me would be doing?”

“Hard to say, Iohann.” Ingrid said “There’s this thing we call the *Butterfly Effect*. A butterfly flaps its wings and half a world away a storm is raging because of it. Little actions can have great consequences. There’s probably a mirror of you that isn’t even a priest because of some minor choice she took differently.”

Siria looked like she was about to question her own sanity. Part of her wondered if the moment she had stepped through the Rogue Rift, Ingrid had been replaced with a far more intelligent, scholarly version of herself. For the past couple of minutes the human was just delivering rapid-fire academica that she felt like she was back in that city of the magi where scholars all around the world were casually discussing wild but tantalizingly plausible theories of what could be or might have been. The only difference was that Ingrid had something to show for it every time.

She glanced at Philia, who met her gaze with a knowing look, the ex-princess’ eyes letting her know that she not only shared the same conclusions as the Nemesis-Stalker, but deliberately held her silence and let speak. Ingrid herself probably wasn't aware of it, but the Elion-Nosco princess, as well as Neith ---her academic superiors--- staying quiet was a brilliant move to prop her up as she unwittingly asserted her intellectual bonafides to the team.

The elf let out a sigh, a half-laugh, sheepish and just utterly impressed at how learned this human was. Behind her eccentric choices such as adopting dangerous creatures and a penchant for utilizing weapons and techniques considered cone hat, it seemed that her choices were tempered with a deeper understanding of the natural world’s lesser-known aspects. Aspects that while little-studied still governed the fabric of existence with equal gravity.

 

""So that's what it was..."" Siria muttered, Ingrid’s exegesis of time-travel and mirrored worlds brought to mind her own encounter with something she could not understand.

Ingrid raised a curious eyebrow.

""Not your first rodeo is it?""

""I suppose, I'm not sure what a rodeo is… I’ve never spoken about this to anyone since most would have dismissed it as a tall tale or consider me a cone hat but… at one time,” Siria related, “I entered a Rogue Rift and it looked eerily like the Arlon Highlands. It had the Star Trees but they looked much smaller-"" she paused as Zefir quickly interrupted for an explanation.

""*Those are like, really tall world trees*."" Zefir said for Ingrid and Cecil’s benefit.

""They were only a quarter-height to what we have now-"" Siria continued.

""In our timeline they breach the atmosphere."" Philia added. “My guess is that their leaves are adapted for anaerobic environments and maximum solar radiation.”

“What Philia’s saying is that the upper branches of a full-grown star tree don’t need to breathe air and have adapted for withstanding the true power of the sun’s rays, something we’re all taking for granted.” Ingrid explained.

“What do you mean a star tree’s upper branches don’t breathe?” Kinu inquired, she was crouching down as she examined a small squat house. It reminded her of a miniature kobold's house as it had a pole set in front of it, but it lacked a door. A name plate was set at the entrance which her \[Interpretation Spell\] translated as ""SPOT"". She crouched and peered in but found it empty.

“*Dog house. Someone’s pet lived there.*” Zefir quietly explained to Kinu, watching her feed.

“Not anymore…” Kinu whispered, a chain was affixed to the pole in front of the dog house, she lifted it and found it broken. “...the worm-heads took it.”

\_\_\_

 

“Good question Kinu,” Ingrid replied as she saw her inspect the dog house. “If you fly up high enough, the air will be so thin you can hardly breathe. You’ll notice that if you climb up very high mountains. Now, go even higher and there’s no air at all. That layer of air that surrounds our world is the atmosphere, not only does it allow us to breathe but it also shields us from the harmful effects of the sun. Yes, harmful. Without the atmosphere’s protection, the unbridled power of the sun’s rays would… how do I say this, corrupt and destroy everything it touches. Therefore, a Star Tree’s upper branches that poke out from the atmosphere must have adapted to not only live in an environment where there’s no breathable air, but also thrive from the sun’s rays at full force.”

*“I’ve seen it…”* Gwen said, a slight tinge of dread in her voice. “*A long time ago King Fish brought high beyond the sky a series of machines called Satellites… I observed through their cameras the ground shrink away as they were steadily brought higher and higher up. The ground curved and…*” there was a crinkling sound as the cat girl maid shrunk back in her seat. “*...it’s nothing but dark out there…*”

“Welcome to the club, Outlaw.” Ingrid said.

“Save it for another time.” Philia said dismissively “And if you keep that attitude up Outlaw, I’m going to take you with us should we need to visit the ISS.”

There were looks of apprehension from most of the girls as Gwen told her vague story, but none of the earthlings looked disturbed.

“Go on, Siria.” Ingrid encouraged, “You said the Rift World you visited was like our Terragalia but with younger star trees.”

""Right…” Siria replied slowly, her mind still spinning at how Ingrid didn’t seem to run out of scholarly sageness. “Also, the Highlands didn't have the Skyeater Titan's bones either.""

""Okay, now that's just impossible in our Terragalia's timeline."" Philia said, stroking her chin thoughtfully. ""Because that Titan predates the growth of the Star Grove. I would know, I carbon dated them.""

""A what?"" the elf's ears drooped inquiringly.

""Carbon-dating. It’s a way to get a precise age of an object"" Ingrid explained for her ""When you burn things, you’re pretty much just reducing them to carbon, albeit in the form of charred remains. It’s in all living things and carbon has a very predictable rate at which it decays, which is why Philia is so sure that you weren’t thrown into the past of our Terragalia but a mirror of it.”

“I…ummm…” Siria began again, feeling the full brunt of the level of these earthlings' understanding of concepts that delved literally into the fabric of reality and beyond.

Ingrid patted Siria’s head purring as she did so. “Don’t worry. Let’s just ransack a university library somewhere, if it exists. I’m sure our week-long sabbatical will give you enough time to read a lot of them.”

“I’d like that.” Siria smiled, going back to read the newspaper alongside Cecil and the rest.

 

“Well that makes making decisions easier for now, doesn’t it?” Kvaris beamed “If we’re in the past of a mirrored Earth, then we can act here without consequence.”

“**WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOOOOOME! Woo-oooh-oooh-aaah-aaah-aaaah!**” Ingrid, Philia, Cecil, Zefir and even Neith cried out in chorus, raising their arms and screeching like rabid chimpanzees, causing everyone else to burst out laughing at the sudden outburst, especially at the strange animal-like sounds they made afterwards, even the mice were squeaking in mirth.

After 18 months of renovating my basement, I’m finally nearing the finish line, I did all the work myself and even milled up my own custom trim and built the Murphy bed and media cabinet—but I need your help with the final details!

First off, the wall color is Sherwin Williams Succulent 9650 (Matte on walls, Satin on trim), and I’ve also gotten the OK to paint the ceiling. Right now, I don’t mind the off-white—it feels warm and comfortable—but should I paint it? I feel like going with Succulent 9650 on the ceiling is too predictable. Would an accent color work better? Open to suggestions!

What I Need Help With:

Rug Selection – What size/ style should I go for?

Artwork / Antiques – Looking for unique ideas to add character.

Half-Wall (5’ Tall) – Thinking of adding wallpaper to the upper section—good idea? Any recommendations?

Murphy Bed & Built-Ins – There’s a horizontal Murphy bed at the far end that needs a new paint color and custom cabinetry to encase it. What color should I go with?

Media Cabinet Upgrades – I want to trim the face frame with cherry hardwood. Any other wood species or door/louver ideas to conceal AV components?

Furniture & Pillows – Open to pillow and furniture specifically coffee table suggestions for the space!

A Few More Things…
	•	The tour poster and lamp on the drum/table don’t fully match the vibe. I thought the drum-table concept was pretty creative, but I need to improve the lamp and overall look—ideas?
	•	The leather La-Z-Boy is temporary, so no need to factor it into the final layout!

Would love to hear your thoughts and ideas—thanks in advance!

However!  The Papua New Guinea Jiwaka Arufa Natural,  is absolutely AMAZING!  I just made my first cup at 2 days shy of the 3 week recommendation, because I'm out of rested coffee and this one is the next closest lol. And even with that, it's an amazingly clean and smooth with a honey like sweetness, and prominent aroma of berries.  I can't imagine how much better this can be, but I'm looking forward to it, I'm glad I got a full 300g bag of this one! Next will be the sample bag of DR Congo Kivu Hutwe Honey.

 I've yet to open the 2 co-ferments as they recommend 4+ weeks but I may dip into late in week 3, just to experience the change over the following few weeks.

Fast forward 2 years, after no symptoms and having change my lifestyle substantially (quitting everything but occasional coffee and losing weight and working out [6' 2"", 200 lbs]), out of the blue I developed another, however smaller, blindspot. This time it is almost in the center of my vision just offset to the right but this time in my lower vision. I go to the doctor who says everything looks great! All optic nerve function, retinal mapping, visual field tests and the eye under a slit lamp looks great, no sign of extra vessels or any new cotton wool spots indicative of retinopathy. I ask for any help in which he says to run blood tests to check for auto-immune disorders, diabetic blood levels etc. Again, everything comes back fine. 

Now, not more than the last 3 weeks, I have developed 4 new ones all in the right eye and each encroaching closer and closer to my central vision. I have tried diet changes, even sleeping with a pillow to help posture in case it's a blood flow issue. Again, nothing. The crazy part is, all of these spots show up as scintillating scotomas for weeks before they become permanent. If I am low on bloodsugar or if I don't sleep well, I will see more spots but they will go away as I move around and eat food. But then, like today, I had already ate, only had one cup of coffee, and was just sitting in my car when one formed in a single blink. And then never went away. It is particularly noticeable on stark contrasts like the shadows of curtains or white on black tiles (picture attached).

Please let me know if you have any idea as to what is happening. My job is very dependent on vision and I am very scared that this will make it impossible to follow my passions or continue down this path!! Thank you to anyone who can help me at least look for a solution or a pathway to diagnosis because, as of right now, everything is idiopathic minus a few spots on an amsler grid.

# 🎵 Anthropic Wins Legal Round vs. Music Publishers

[Read More](https://www.reuters.com/legal/anthropic-wins-early-round-music-publishers-ai-copyright-case-2025-03-26/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

A U.S. federal judge denied Universal Music Group and other publishers’ request for a **preliminary injunction** against Anthropic. The plaintiffs claim the Claude AI model infringes on copyright by generating song lyrics. The judge ruled there was **no proof of irreparable harm** while the full case proceeds.

* Music publishers including Universal Music Group and Concord had alleged in their October 2023 lawsuit that Anthropic ""unlawfully copies and disseminates vast amounts of copyrights works"" while building its AI models.
* The judge ruled that the publishers failed to demonstrate reputational harm or market value diminishment from Anthropic's use of their work, highlighting the ongoing legal battles between AI companies and copyright holders.

**What this means:** This is a **major early victory** for AI developers, supporting the argument that **intermediate use of copyrighted material** in training doesn’t always require licensing. The outcome may influence future AI copyright policy.

I totally get it if it's not your thing, but has anyone noticed that the people who do this are the same that owed Isaac's lyrics so much careful attention? Besties isn't a Happy Friendship Anthem and For The Cold Country isn't about sitting and drinking coffee with someone (something I genuinely saw someone say lmao). You can literally get that on a single listen of each song. It really feels like just because it isn't Isaac on lyrics they suddenly stopped caring to even hear what the lyrics are saying and dumb the songs down to nothing, especially when songs like Nancy have themes of things like suicidal ideation--even though that isn't out yet, more serious themes in the singles have been thrown out as well.

She retired and I never got any of that dental work done, because she was my favorite dentist and I'm afraid of the dentist. So fast forward to 2023 - I have insane amounts of pain in my mouth and break down and go to the dentist. They take X-rays and I have like 13 fucking cavities man. They tell me yes I do need a root canal on the tooth my dentist told me years prior AND another tooth that was a cavity not taken care of. I slowly get all this work done on my teeth between 2023-2024. I get 13 cavities filled and 2 root canals and my cleaning at the end of the year. I understand that this was all my fault because I failed to go to the dentist and properly take care of my teeth. 

Now that I understand how PAINFUL teeth pain can be, I take my oral hygiene very serious. I brush 2-3 times a day with Sensodyne, floss with these grin (brand) fine teeth flosser things - I've had so much dental work I find it hard to get actual floss between my teeth, and I use listerine mouth wash twice a day.

So- today I go to the dentist and they take X-rays of my teeth and tell me I have 4 cavities and need a gum graft due to the gum recession thanks to my tongue ring. They tell me I HAVE to take my tongue ring out and get my cavities filled. I understand my tongue ring is bad and caused gum recession and I don't give a fuck about that. I'm tired of going to the dentist being told every time I fucking go I have a cavity or 5. 

What else can I possibly do? I don't drink soda - and if I do I drink Olipop. I don't drink coffee. I don't eat candy/sweets that often. I do vape, and I know thats bad for your teeth too and I'm in the process of quitting for my overall health anyways. I don't chew gum. I try to avoid everything food related that's ""bad"" for your teeth and when I do consume them I make sure to brush and floss really well. So please tell me how I can stop getting cavities so often. 



and please tell me its not because of my tongue ring. thank you. unless it is :(  ig... i just don't wanna take it out.. i love it :( ",1,1743039727.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False

I was just wondering what Puyallup is like, I'm originally from western Washington but more north, and I'm not super familiar with anything south of Seattle. Anyway, here's some of my questions...

Where's the best place to eat? Are there any local cooking classes offered?

What place serves the best coffee?

What's the best gym for weight lifters?

What do you do for fun in Puyallup? 

Best bars? What's the bar life like ( I am familiar with dancing clubs filled with 20 year olds lol) 

What's the best way to make friends in the area?

Any other advice you can think of would be appreciated, thank you :) ",1,1743039707.0,PuyallupWA,2,0.67,False

1jksp06,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jksp06,Dingle Single Cask Madeira,"I got my bottle today, amazingly quick delivery to NJ.  Especially quick since when it was released last week the US wasn't a shipping option, but managed to find a way around that.   I'm not an expert reviewer, but here's my take....

On the nose very nice: peppered, sweet honey.  Cinnamon on green apples (green apples not something I usually get with Dingle).     The taste is very Dingle with spicy notes, some chocolate, a darker spice I think is cloves.   Definitely cloves, which is funny because I don't like cloves but this darker hint with some caramel is really nice.  Cask strength comes through on the palate.   Added a drop of water, really opens up the Dingle 'hay and oats' that I got on many of the early batches.

I didn't have any Batch 5 (I think that was the one w/some madeira?) but I opened a core release single malt and I had a Founding Father bottling from the Palace Bar.  5 year old sherry cask, prob not a great comparison but we're drinking Dingle and it's all good.

Palace bar is all sherry....very sherry, and touch of sulfur but nothing like some other FF I've had.  Licorice, coffee, and raisins.   Better than I remember on last tasting, but we won't mention the price, mostly because I forget what I paid.

Lastly is the Dingle Single malt.  Gosh this is really good stuff and I'm so glad they got it right after all the batches.   Creamy, spicy vanilla, nutmeg.   Getting a butterscotch almost instead of the toffee I remember.  Also some salt, almost an Oban-like sea note.  Love it.  Some espresso with fruits on the taste.  Mmmm.

Back to the Single Cask madeira and the extra sweetness really shines.  Less bourbon sweetness and more honey and green apples (I checked the website and they weren't wrong!).  I like it.    At 3x the price of the core bottling you might hesitate, but initial thoughts are very good.   

Bottle 264/282.  Doesn't have a cask # on the bottle....maybe they only bottled one?

So today, I was at Starbucks, just enjoying my morning, when a woman stormed in demanding a ""venti caramel macchiato with extra foam"". First you're rude asf, and didn't even wait in line. Then she started berating the barista because they didn’t have the “right kind” of caramel syrup. She was calling him incompetent and complaining that the store was “ruining her entire day.”

As she was finishing her rant, she slipped on the wet floor by the counter (no one had noticed the spill yet) and landed straight on her behind. The entire cafe went silent for a moment. Me? I creaking CACKLED. She threw me a nasty glare but her face was red from embarrassment. The barista, still with a smile, handed her the drink she had ordered. 

She took a long, awkward sip—obviously trying to act like nothing had happened—but you could tell it was a humbling moment for her.

Part Two: Come as you are....to Barnes and Noble,"Howdy everyone, it’s me the All-Knowing Fungus, but you can call me Nort. For the approval of ReddX Inc, I have another story of my tie with NirvanaBeard. Sorry an update has been so long, but life can get busy. To try to make things easier for the reader I will be making a few changes. Change 1: For now, on I will be referring to myself as “OP”. Why? Cause even though I know my name is fun to say, I doubt people want to say it  over and over again. Change 2: Just like change 1, I will be referring to NirvanaBeard as “NB” for convenience’s sake. Nirvanabeard can be a mouthful so hopefully simplifying it will make things easier to read (and to type). With that being said, CAST.

 

Cast:

OP: First time barista experiencing the wonders of his first real job! Naïve, 19, and now finally making his own money.

NirvanaBeard (NB): My legbeard coworker. As a huge passion for Kurt Cobain, kinda socially awkward, and changes her hair color more than Ramona Flowers. Hate to make this comparison but she did give off “Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Ruined a Whole Generation of Women” vibes. (yeah, I know that songs sucks, but it’s pretty accurate to her aesthetic)

Sorry for no new characters, but I promise next part there will be at least one new character. Promise and swearsies. With that out of the way let’s get back to The Strange Case of NirvanaBeard.

I’ve been working for about two weeks at this point. At the time my duties consisted of bakings, packing baked goods, taking orders, or working window. I was having a good time so far, and the free coffee was just what my caffeine addiction needed. I started to warm up to NirvanaBeard. Sure, at the time I thought she was weird, but overall she was still pretty friendly. She did help the pass time through are many conversations. I did get to know a little bit more about her. I learned she dropped out of highschool, her mother walked out on her, and her dad had a history with drugs and was currently in rehab. I didn’t learn much about her boyfriend though so all I had to go off him was the foul bracelet from the last story and he kept a dead goat in his bathtub. I also learned Nirvanabeard played guitar. That gave us some common ground because I had a history of playing trumpet. Sure hearing about Kurt Cobain all the time did get annoying, but usually I was able to steer the conversation to other musicians. I even got her into Dio.

One day while sharing a shift she would approach me with an invitation.

NB: Hey, Op we should hang out after work.

OP: Yeah? Whatcha had in mind?

NB: I don’t know, do you have any ideas?

Since I still didn’t really know her too well I came up with the suggestion about going to Barnes and Noble. It was fairly close to the café and I might be able to learn more of her interests beside Kurt Cobain, playing guitar, and vaping.

OP: How about Barnes and Noble?

NB: The sounds cool and you could actually help me.

OP: With what?

NB: I’m missing one album to complete my nirvana collection. I’ve been having trouble finding it maybe you could help.

OP: Sure. I get off an hour before you so I’ll just chill in the park near the fountain til you show up.

NB: Sounds like a plan.

Now, I’m not gonna lie. I was excited. I love Barnes and Noble. I could spend hours there by myself.  Plus seemed like I was also going to make a new friend. I was just out of highschool and I needed to make some more. Sure, I saw red flags, and did thing she was batshit insane at times, but maybe she just needed a friend. I never heard her talking much about other friends she had. The only person she talked about (besides Kurt Cobain) was her boyfriend.

After I got off work, I drove to the park outside of Barnes and Noble. I sat down on a bench near the fountain and just enjoyed nature. Bird watching and stuff. I was playing Pokemon Go at the time, so I try to also catch some for that hit of dopamine. I remember I was about to catch one then everything went black. Someone put their hands over my eyes. I was a bit startled, so I jumped up to confront whoever dared to blind me while I was in the middle of the sacred deed of pokemans collecting. Totally not because I was a little pussy and my flight or fight kicked in, nope. I come to my bearings and see the culprit. It was NirvanaBeard.

OP: Shit, you scared the fuck out of me.

NB (laughing): Hahahahaha, holy crap you’re so skittish.

OP: Alright alright, get your jollies. Ready to go look at books and miscellaneous items and trinkets?

NB: Yeah, lets go.

We walk in and the first thing she does is go straight for the CD’s. She was on a mission. Find the album Bleach by Nirvana. I helped and after awhile we did indeed find it.

OP: So, is this album good?

NB: All Nirvana Albums are good.

OP: I mean is this like one of their most popular albums?

NB: Actually, this is one of their least popular.

OP: Really? Is it like an Eminem Curtain Call situation or….?

NB: Nah, it just wasn’t received well.

OP: Well, I guess not every song or Album can be a hit. Eminem did make a song called Fack after all.

NB: ALL NIRVANA SONGS ARE GOOD

OP: Didn’t they make a song called Moist vagina?

NB: Yeah, but The Man Who Sold the World is super good.

OP: That’s a David Bowie song.

NB: Who?

After that we moved on and looked at more aisles. We went through the manga section, fantasy, and ect. There was one point while in the poetry section she made a joke of how a French word on a book made it look like its said “7 little (not a nice word for homosexuals)”. I was surprised she said the word and then I notice the poetry section was right next to the LGBT+ section. I quickly walked us to a new aisle, because she did say it pretty loud.

We eventually made it to the Astrology section. Personally, I’m not too into astrology. Bluntly I think it’s dumb. What? You TOched ThE DoOr KnoB BefOre oPenIng tHE DooOr? MUST BE A LEO. Sorry to all astrology lovers reading this that I might have pissed off. NirvanaBeard wasn’t a fan of my take either.

NB: Whattt that’s mean OP.

OP: Eh, Im sorry. Maybe I’m missing something.

NB: Can you guess my sign?

OP: Pisces?

NB: Yeah, how did you know?

OP: I didn’t. I just said Pisces because it sounds like piss. (Gotta love my 19-year-old sense of humor)

NB: Well, what’s your sign?

OP: That water one, aguarius.

NB: You totally are an aguarius.

OP: Yeah? Happy knowing the alignment of the planets and stars dictated my entire personality.

Apologies one more time. At times I could be a cynical bastard. Combining that with my habit of giving my complete honest opinion hold the sugar coating, sometimes I wasn’t the most fun person to be around. Overall I think its better to be honest than a yes man, and when you ask my opinion on something, I will be honest.

After that we checked out. Nirvanabeard got her album, and I bought the first volume of Berserk deluxe edition. We then said our goodbyes to each other.

NB: Thank you for hanging out with me OP. It was really fun.

OP: Thank you for inviting me. I had a good time.

NB: We should do something like this again.

OP: Maybe one day.

We both walk to our cars and I head home. Later that night I get a snapchat message from her. Bracing myself just in case I once again see her period fluid. Luckily this time it wasn’t. It was a TikTok. I opened it and it was a video of Kurt Cobian pictures with Change (in the house of flies) playing in the background. Fucking Kurt Cobian man.

Well, that’s the end of this part of The Strange Case of Nirvanabeard. Sorry this one was kinda bland. One of the reasons it took me so long to write this (outside if being busy) was how I can make this story interesting. I do think this story adds context to later events but yeah, I’ll admit it might be on the more boring side of beard stories. Hopefully next part will be more entertaining as we will see NirvanaBeard face a great foe. The homeless street preacher with a blessed ability to perform miracles we dubbed, JesusGuy. Until then, yall have a good one. Once again if you have critiques leave them in the comments it will only help me get better. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you have a great rest of the day. This is Nort signing out.

1jksfu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Devilcorp/comments/1jksfu1/read_this_if_you_are_struggling_with_ptsd_or/,"Read This If You Are Struggling With ""PTSD"" or ""Trauma"" After Working at a Devil Corp","First off, I love this fucking subreddit and I love all of you. I spent like 3 hours writing this as a reply to someone that said they were dealing with feeling traumatized after working with Smart Circle, but they deleted their post before I could submit it, and I just want to share it here for that guy, and for anyone else that feels the same way. I wasted 13 months of my life in a Devil Corp and can spot a Devil Corp from a single fucking paragraph 99% of the time (and 100% of the time from looking at a Devil Corp website). I was fucked up after leaving Devil Corp and it took me almost a year to get over it. 

Today, I fucking love my life more in this moment than I ever have, and I know that tomorrow will be the next best day of my life. If you are struggling, or if you feel ashamed, regret, or any doubt over leaving a company that consists of the brainwashed, 20-year-old dipshit college dropouts in Goodwill suits with no work-life balance that beg inside of a Costco while making less than the homeless guy down the block while smelling their upline's farts for a career choice (or if you just want to laugh), then this post is for you:

""Thank you for sharing your story. I experienced the exact same things that you went through at Devil Corp. The difference between you and me is that I spent an entire 13 months of my life at Devil Corp.  
  
So first off, you’re going to be fine. It was only a month (or however long) you spent there thank God. I don’t doubt you feel traumatized, I did too. Took me about a year or so to finally feel better for leaving and I thank God I did every day. I watched the Slave Circle Documentary on YouTube about a dozen times, I kept in touch with everyone else that left with me (9/10 people we started the office with left after I quit cause I was the only person that actually gave a shit about them as people and not as dollar signs), and to tell you the truth, I still felt traumatized for about an entire year after quitting. 

I was fucking brainwashed. I thought I was working towards financial freedom which is why fucking put in all the hours I could, hired more people than I could possibly remember, and sold more than anyone in the ENTIRE NATION (I was on the top rep call) the month before I quit, and I decided to quit because I couldn't stand to see my ELs, my CTs, and anyone that I PERSONALLY CONVINCED to go into this fucking business and work for/with me be mistreated to the level that they were. Personally, I thought I just gave up $100k+ salary and my ticket to financial freedom for morals that I wasn't sure I even believed in at the time. 

HOWEVER, time will save you brother (or girl idk). Might not be today or tomorrow, but it will. Your healing will look different to mine, but here are the things I did.  
  
Moving back in with my parents and going back to school was the first thing I did for 8 months. Felt miserable, started drinking heavily, felt a lot of shame, and couldn’t stop thinking about the whole experience. I don’t recommend you do any of that (unless you’re strapped for cash and can rely on your parents for support). The big changes came when I decided I wanted to move out of my parents' place. My parents were able to help support me in getting my own place which I am EXTREMELY grateful for, but I had to get back into the workforce.  
  
So, I applied at literally everything. I actually got interviewed at another “Devil Corp” like business that does nonprofits, and I decided to accept it because I thought “maybe it was just the one Devil Corp that was bad” and I left after the first day lol. As soon as I experienced a single day with another Devil Corp, I went from being 99% to 1000% confident that I made the right decision to leave Devil Corp. So that helped a lot. So now that I was confident that I did not want a Devil Corp job, I decided to get a job that will help me pay for my tuition while I pursue my degree in accounting.   
  
Side note: I assume you don’t have a degree, so I suggest getting the degree, and getting it for free. There are numerous jobs today that offer free college if you work there part time. I chose Starbucks because they just happened to offer free, full-ride tuition for an online accounting program I was currently taking. This gave me a goal, which if you’re in a Devilcorp or not, you need goals and dreams to survive. So, I suggest looking up businesses that offer free college because it’s only going to improve your life getting the degree. (Other side note, don’t get a fucking liberal arts degree unless it’s truly your passion. Accounting, finance, or if you want to be miserable then engineering; jk I love you nerds and you guys keep society from collapsing. I wish I could be you, but I'll just take care of the fucking taxes for you lol).  
  
So, here’s how it all played out for me. I got the most bullshit job in the world from a shoe store that offered me 8-20 hours at $14/hour. It is the most blowoff job in the world, and I FUCKING LOVE IT! I basically just shoot the shit with my coworkers all shift. When the manager hired me he straight up said he didn’t wanna waste my time lol. It’s a meaningless, pointless job that I am overqualified for, but it got me back into the workforce which was all that mattered to me.  
  
Next, I found a Starbucks that was literally 5 minutes away from my apartment and I called and called and called until they finally gave me a part time (I don't even like coffee anymore lol). This allowed me to be eligible for the scholarship for my accounting degree. Its slightly fast paced, but I spent years working in fine dining so I’m a fucking savage at Starbucks (and I love people) so it’s a very easy job, and I’ll have a free accounting degree by the end of 2026!  
  
And just to put the cherry on top of the ice cream sundae (I shit you not that's how it's spelled), there is a Chipotle that is literally connected to the same building of the Starbucks, and I decided to get a part time there. They loved that I was working at Starbucks and that I was so GOAL ORIENTED AND HAD DREAMS that I was able to get a part time there as well.  
  
So, in summation, I get 20 hours and a free college degree from Starbucks, 20 hours and FREE FAT BURRITOS from Chipotle, and just in case I need extra cash, I get however many hours I want at the shoe store. Even better, the gym I go to is literally 1 minute from the Starbucks/Chipotle which is only 5 minutes from my apartment. I’m bulking like a motherfucker, and my squat is almost back up to 365. I’ve been able to spend more time on the piano which I have loved since I was a kid, I’ve gotten back in touch with my faith (shout out to my boy Jesus Christ for forgiving all the fuck ups I made in my life), I have the best relationships with my old coworkers, I’ve become the guy that smiles at strangers and gives them positive compliments for the fuck of it, and I have never GENUINELY been this happy in my entire fucking life.  
  
But maybe the best thing about my life (second best, Jesus always comes first) is that I don’t give a fuck about the money anymore. I was always that kid that wanted to be a millionaire by 25 and a billionaire by 40. I did so many hustles, so much bullshit that I felt I needed to do, and I hated myself for how unsuccessful I was in my own eyes. It was this same greed and shame that led me into getting roped into a fucking Devil Corp and I am beyond grateful for the experience because I was able reach this paradigm shift as an indirect result.  
  
For the record, I did not grow at Devil Corp, I grew AFTER I LEFT Devil Corp. Devil Corp growth is oxymoronic (might not even be “oxy” lol). Get ready, because your life is going to experience a lot of REAL growth and get a lot better once this “PTSD” (or whatever the fuck Devil Corp does to people) wears off.  
  
It takes a long time for people to understand just how miserable they are, and an even longer time for them to realize that it doesn’t have to be that way. (gold star to anybody that knows where that quote is from without Google). You can literally copy every fucking thing I did in this post, and I hope you do because like I said, I have never been this happy in my entire life.  
  
The best part too is that I’m no longer thinking about what I’m going to do after I get my degree. I will cross that bridge when I come to it. I could work to open my own accounting firm, I could go into real estate, who tf knows, and who tf cares. The best part is that the fear I had of working as a CPA for $60k-$70k for 40 years and retiring old at 65 doesn’t scare me anymore because I NO LONGER VALUE MONEY OVER PEOPLE AND GENUINE HUMAN CONNECTION!  
  
Worrying about what I’m going to do in 5 years, 10 years, and 40 years only stressed me out. I have a single 1.5-2-year goal (get my degree) and that’s it. Let me say this again, the worst-case scenario is that I work a 9-5, $60k-$70k/year accounting job for 40 years and retire at 65….THAT IS THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR MY CAREER AFTER I GET THE DEGREE, because I finally value people, and genuine human connection more than money (why do you think I’m “wasting” my time writing this? I’m writing this for you because you’re a person, and that’s reason enough for me now.).  
  
Like I said, you’re going to be fine. If you take four pieces of advice from this post, I hope it’s this:  
  
1. Accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior if you haven’t already, because he fucking loves you. He always has, always will, and he has forgiven you for every single thing that you have done and will do in this life.  
  
2. Get the degree and get it free. Just google “jobs that offer free tuition” and pick your favorite.  
  
3. Adjust your relationship with money. It's nice, but it is not everything. The correlation between the amount of money you make and the amount of happiness you receive from it caps out at $70k/year (maybe $80k with inflation). The fact is that you can't take any of it with you after you die, and your health and personal relationships will always be more important than the money.

4. DON’T WORRY! Worrying is literally useless. Worrying is betting against yourself. It’s suggesting that you have some sort of knowledge about what is going to happen to your life that it literally acts as a form of ego. Just pay your bills on time, pack heat if you need to, and DON’T WORRY! (second gold star to whoever knows the great man that said this fire line without Google).

Most people that get out of Devil Corp are so damn young that it is so ridiculous how much life you still have to look forward too. Feel what you need to feel, take care of yourself and your family, and move on. Getting into a Devil Corp was the worst decision of my life, and getting out of it was the best. I cannot stress this enough; you are going to be fine.   
  
Hope this helps, much love.

Chapter Four - “If You’ll Have Me”:

Ray stepped through the door, finding the house steeped in silence. A wrapped plate of food sat untouched on the table.

""Thomason?"" he called, setting down his coat. No answer. He took the stairs two at a time. ""I've something important to tell you.""

A sound—barely more than breath—came from the bedroom.

He found her sitting upright on the bed, hands slack in her lap, gaze fixed on nothing. The room was dim, the last light of evening filtering through the window.

Ray sat beside her, brushing a kiss to her temple. She was cold to the touch. ""What's wrong?""

She spoke without looking at him. ""She's staying. Mum.""

Ray exhaled. He had expected as much, but it didn't make hearing it any easier. ""She said that?""

""She as much as did,""  Thomason's voice wavered. ""Talked like there was never any other choice. Like she'd already made peace with it.""

A dry track of tears marked her cheek, though she barely seemed aware of them. 

Slowly, she curled her fingers into his jacket, gripping the fabric tight.

Ray said nothing. He wanted to, yet not a word came. None that wouldn't sound empty.

For minutes, they sat in silence, their breathing the only sound in the room.

Then, at last, Ray spoke, his voice quieter than before. ""Love... I'm setting off tomorrow.""

Thomason stiffened at his words. ""What?""

""It's Mr. Ford,"" he said, though he wasn't sure why. ""He's given me a task of some importance.""

She pulled away, searching his face. Her own was unreadable for a moment, then—

""And you'll leave me here?""

Ray hesitated. His hands, resting on his knees, felt suddenly unsteady. His pulse had picked up, though he couldn't have said when. He swallowed.

""... Yes.""

A beat. Then Thomason laughed—a hollow sound, sharp at the edges. ""I know how you are. That obsession of yours. But I never thought—"" Her voice caught. She shook her head. ""Never thought you'd leave for it.""

He faltered. ""Thomason—""

She scoffed. ""What's too important?""

Ray licked his lips. ""Something's knocking at the doorstep of our world. A pulse, with no effect on its surroundings, yet detectable across space. Last night, its rhythm shifted. Just once. And then returned."" 

He shook his head. ""We don't even know if the state we found it in is even its true, original state.""

She stared at him. ""You're flying to space for a bloody pulse?""

""Mysterious phenomena don't change their behavior on a whim. And—"" He hesitated. ""A man disappeared.""

""What?""

""A Dr. James. I had seen him staring into a light the day before I learned of the pulse. Now he is gone.""

Thomason's mouth tightened. ""And what does that have to do with anything?""

Ray was quiet for a moment. Then, finally: ""... I don't know.""

Another silence, longer this time.

Then, quietly, Thomason said, ""... And you have to?""

Ray met her eyes. ""Yes.""

A slow exhale. She looked away, as if to collect herself. Then, without another word, she turned to leave.

Ray caught her hand.

""I will know,"" he said, quiet but firm. ""And when I return, I'll set it aside. The study, the work. You and I—we'll take the time we ought to have."" He softened, his grip easing. ""If you'll have me.""

Thomason stood still for a long moment. Then, at last, she gave the smallest nod. No smile, no frown. Just a nod.
She sat back down beside him, resting a hand over his.

Nothing more was said.



Ray strode back into the ASA, his mind still reeling from the weight of his imminent departure, when he found Ford and Dr. Monroe already waiting in the corridor. 

Ford's lips curled into a wry smile as they stepped together into an elevator that ascended with a quiet, near-silent efficiency. 

The lift's digital readout ticked off each floor until, at last, its doors slid open to reveal the launch bay.

The area was a marvel of futuristic engineering: sleek spacecraft parked on magnetically levitated pads, their surfaces gleaming with smart glass and reflective alloys. 

Overhead, holographic displays floated near each vessel, streaming real-time diagnostics—fuel levels, propulsion calibrations, and trajectory data, all verified by quantum sensors. 

Automated maintenance drones moved with precision between the ships, ensuring every system was in optimal condition.

Before Ray could fully take in the scene, Beatrice stood in the threshold, dressed smartly in an ASA-issued jumpsuit with subtle piping denoting her department, moved briskly toward him. 

In one fluid motion, she handed him a neatly folded packet containing his personal attire and mission equipment—a compact environmental data logger, a multi-spectrum communicator, and a streamlined diagnostic toolkit.

She flashed a cheeky, supportive grin. ""Totally forgot about your top-secret mission until Mr. Ford roped me into the launch. You never forget anything—suppose even you aren't immune to the abyss.""

Ray's stern features softened into a wry smile as he patted her on the shoulder. ""I shall do my utmost to return, Beatrice. In the meantime, keep questioning. Learn all you can.""

With that, she turned on her heel, adjusted the collar of her new coat, and strode confidently down the corridor, distributing similar packets to the other mission scientists.

Shortly after, Ford reappeared and gathered the team in a sleek, glass-walled conference room. The room was utilitarian yet futuristic, its walls embedded with touch-sensitive displays and transparent LED panels showing star maps and live telemetry. 

Ford's tone was brisk and measured.

""Right, listen up,"" he began. ""Following Dr. Monroe's report, we noted that last night the pulse's rhythm deviated—from 1.460 seconds to 1.40 seconds—only to revert by morning. This irregularity, though minor, suggests an external influence we cannot ignore. We're assembling a team to travel to Origin Point Theta and study the phenomenon directly.""

He paused. ""Your ship will be equipped with autonomous re-supply modules, cryogenic food packs for a two-week pre-sleep period, and a high-bandwidth communications array that utilizes quantum entanglement to maintain constant contact with Headquarters. Once all systems are green, you'll then enter a nearly year-long cryosleep for the deep-space transit.""

Ray leaned forward, his eyes gleaming.

Ford continued. ""Doctor Godfrey, you will lead the data-gathering efforts. We must record every variable, every fluctuation. This is our chance to decode the pulse—what it is, and what it means for us all. I trust you all to perform to the highest standard.""

With the briefing concluded, each scientist moved to their assigned vessel. 

Ray gathered a few personal items—a photograph of Thomason, a well-worn notebook filled with equations, and a small keepsake—and stepped into his ship. 

The spacecraft's doors slid shut with a smooth, almost imperceptible hiss. In unison, the ships ignited their magnetic thrusters and shot off into the unbounded void at such tremendous speed that bystanders in the hangar had to seek cover to avoid the shockwave of acceleration.

As his vessel lifted from the launch pad and hurtled into the cosmos, Ray's heart pounded with a mixture of dread and determination. He had entered the abyss in pursuit of answers. He would know.



Thomason sat in the dim glow of the living room, her eyes fixed on the phone on the coffee table. Now, silence pressed in, thick and—

BOOM. A low, sharp boom rippled through the house, rattling the glass. Another followed, then another. 

Thomason's breath caught as she turned her gaze toward the window. A streak of light—electric blue, slicing through the sky with an eerie, unnatural precision. And then, nothing. Just the dark expanse of night.

She was alone.

Ray sat hunched forward in his chair, hands dancing across the control interfaces of the ship's command module. 

His eyes flicked from screen to screen, absorbing the vast array of data streams pouring in. 

The vessel, designated Erebus-1, was an elegant marvel—its interior a seamless fusion of stark functionality and cutting-edge sophistication.

Graphene-laced consoles lined the walls, their surfaces adaptive, shifting in response to his inputs. The air carried a faint hum, the ship's quantum-core reactor generating steady power. 

Hollow conduit channels wove through the deck, pulsing with faint cyan light, feeding life to the ship's many intricate systems. 

The artificial gravity plating beneath his feet adjusted subtly to his every movement, compensating for the acceleration. 

The entire structure felt alive, its technology a symphony of precision and possibility.

Ray exhaled, running a hand over the nearest console. ""Extraordinary,"" he muttered. ""Effortless automated vectoring... real-time subatomic diagnostics... this guidance array alone—"" He caught himself, shaking his head. ""No use gawking, Godfrey.""

A flicker on the comms panel drew his attention. 

Then, a voice crackled through the main intercom, the first of many.
""Ladies and gentlemen,"" came Ford's dry, amused tone. ""Next stop: the edge of reason. Drinks provided upon arrival.""

Another voice followed, this one bright and irreverent.

""Who else already regrets not bringing a deck of cards?""

""Fascinating,"" a third chimed in. ""The psychological need for diversion persists even at the precipice of the unknown.""

More followed—greetings, jests, remarks charged with the nervous energy of minds poised between awe and apprehension. But amid the chorus, one absence stood out. 

Monroe said nothing.

Ray tapped a control on his panel, activating his own transmission. He spoke simply, evenly, his voice steady and sure.

""We do not drift aimlessly into the dark. We chart it. We learn it. We are the first to tread this path, and we shall go down in history.""

A moment of silence followed. Then, one by one, quiet affirmations trickled in. A shared understanding. A shared purpose.

Finally, Ray leaned back. Slowly, deliberately, he turned his head to the viewport.

Earth was already a tiny dot in the vacuum of space.
A minute passed. No one spoke.

Ray exhaled, rubbing his brow, then pushed himself up from the command seat. A silent ship was an unnatural thing, even one as meticulously engineered as Erebus-1. 

The absence of Earth's distant hum, of atmospheric drag, of the imperceptible vibrations that belonged to a planet-bound existence—this was silence in its truest form.

He assumed the others were doing as he was, familiarizing themselves with their vessels, moving through the sterile halls with the same quiet reverence.

The gravity plating adjusted subtly as he stepped away from the console, compensating for movement without the slightest jolt or delay. 

The corridor leading from the bridge was narrow but uncluttered, lined with modular panels designed for reconfiguration in the event of system failure. The ship was not spacious—mass efficiency forbade it—but it was far from suffocating. Every square meter had been calculated, optimized.

He passed through the first sliding door and entered what was, evidently, his kitchen. 

Compact, self-contained. The walls housed recessed cabinets, their biometric locks disengaging the moment his presence was registered. Inside, he found a meticulous stockpile: vacuum-sealed ingredients, canned proteins, thermally stabilized rations engineered for maximum longevity. 

A small induction range was built into the counter, its surface pristine.

Tucked neatly beside a pack of cryo-stabilized yeast, he found a thin book. He lifted it. Astronaut Nutritional Guidelines & Meal Preparation Manual.

A smirk. He flipped through the pages—techniques for rehydrating complex proteins, methods for maximizing caloric intake while preserving variety. 

One section detailed the psychological benefits of food that required preparation. A fleeting sense of normalcy, even here.

Satisfied, he moved on.

His quarters were next. As expected, the space was minimal yet sufficient: a single bed, storage compartments flush with the walls, a personal workstation. 

The mattress conformed to microgravity standards, firm enough to support prolonged sleep without compromising circulation.

And then, the viewport.

A single, reinforced window, broad enough to flood the room with the lightless void beyond. Space in its truest form—deep, endless, absolute. No atmosphere to filter light, no haze to obscure the hard clarity of the cosmos. 

The ship's slow rotation altered the view subtly, revealing the faint band of the Milky Way, a silver river suspended in the abyss.

Ray stood there for a long moment, breath shallow, heart steady. It was one thing to understand space as a concept, to break it into figures and equations. It was another to see it laid bare.

Then—
Dung.
A resonance, low, distant, yet distinct. Not the structured hum of the reactor, nor the thermal expansion of the ship's hull. It was external. It was real.

Origin Point Theta.

Ray turned sharply, listening. The pulse repeated again.
He retraced his steps, returning to the command module. 

The displays remained steady, no anomalous readings. But his eyes caught something new—on the far right of the console, a digital clipboard, its interface idling in standby.
He reached for it.

The mission had begun.



The days aboard Erebus-1 fell into a rhythm dictated by necessity. Every hour, every movement had its purpose, each task designed to ease the transition into life beyond gravity. 

Ray adhered to the regimen without complaint, though he could not deny the strange, persistent awareness of his own body in ways he had never considered before.

The first ""mornings"" began with health checks. Vitals, hydration levels, etc. The biometric cuff at his wrist logged everything automatically, streaming it to the onboard medical AI. 

His legs felt weaker already, though he expected that. Fluids had shifted upward, swelling his face slightly, making his reflection look oddly unfamiliar in the compact bathroom mirror. 

He exhaled, stretching against the resistance bands affixed to the walls—necessary measures to counteract the slow erosion of muscle and bone in microgravity.

Afterward, he exercised in the kinetic bay, a narrow space lined with equipment tailored for zero-G conditioning. 

The treadmill harness pressed him down as he ran, simulated gravity forcing his muscles to work. 

Every mission demanded at least two hours of rigorous physical training per day. The treadmill's hum filled the cabin, and for a moment, he imagined he was back on Earth.

Later, he floated into what passed for his personal kitchen, grabbed the recipe book, and took a look.

'Tomato bisque with fresh basil.'

He smirked, tossing the book back into its compartment, then sealing the latch with a flick of his fingers. He would have liked to make something from it. Something Thomason would have made.

His quarters were small yet sufficient, designed for functionality rather than pure comfort. A narrow sleeping pod was affixed to the far wall, while a small work surface extended from the opposite end. There was no clutter, no excess. Everything had its place.

Ray would then hover in front of the large window, and would float there for a moment, arms crossed, staring into the abyss. 

Yet, he could not shake the sensation that something was watching.

He inhaled sharply, shaking his head. Just your mind playing tricks.



The Erebus-1 demanded more than just routine—it required constant vigilance.

Ray spent his time checking the ship's life support systems first. The oxygen reclamation unit was functioning within expected parameters, scrubbing CO₂ from the air with lithium hydroxide filters. 

He ran a secondary diagnostic just to be sure. One clogged valve, one unnoticed fluctuation in atmospheric balance, and he would suffocate before ever seeing Origin Point Theta.

Water recycling followed. The purification loop processed waste fluids with ruthless efficiency, distilling every molecule of moisture back into drinkable water. 

Ray skimmed the reports, confirming that electrolysis was splitting hydrogen and oxygen as expected, ensuring a steady supply of breathable air.

Electrical output was stable, the ship's fusion reactor humming at nominal levels. He checked the power distribution logs, confirming that all non-essential systems remained in low-energy mode. 

There was no room for waste on a mission like this.
Lastly, he inspected the hull integrity reports.

Micrometeoroid strikes were an ever-present threat in deep space, and while Erebus-1 was armored with next-generation composite plating, no material was invincible. 

He cross-referenced the latest sensor sweeps—no impact events, no structural anomalies.

It was all as it should be.

And yet, as Ray drifted back toward the command module, he felt it again—eyes were on him. He exhaled sharply. Just fatigue.

The pulse was a constant throughout the first week. He ended it, as always, checking in with the other crew members over the intercom.

Monroe was silent still.

Ray toggled the channel. ""Doctor Monroe, are you present?""

A pause. Then, the same voice as before—lighthearted, playful. ""Mr. Monroe? Heeellllooooo?""

Ray's fingers hovered over the control. ""Doctor Monroe? Answer if you are present.""

Nothing.

Then—
The comms indicator flickered, illuminating Monroe's name.

And from the speaker came a voice that was not his. 

A deep, warping reverberation, layered and wrong, twisting as if it came from beneath his throat rather than within it.



""Utik—na šiša.""



Silence.

No one spoke. No one even breathed.

Then, from Monroe's side—
A sound. A tearing, slow and wet. Fabric? No. Something thicker. Something resisting, then giving way.

1jks7q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jks7q1/751_days_a_reflection/,751 Days - A reflection.,"Hello to whoever may read this,
I’m not sure if this style post is welcome, but I’ve never shared my experience and feel as if I am ready. 

I’m currently 24 years old, and for the last two years I’ve been free of alcohol. Thinking back on the last 8 or so years 6 of those I drank and I should’ve known the signs. In early high school when friends would drink I’d drink until I puked. Without fail. 

Fast forward a couple years I got to travel the world, and waste days shit faced rolling around the streets of cities I don’t know if I’ll ever see again. As I turned 21 I was given a liter of grey goose this is where I felt the turning point. 

After a breakup I drank that bottle daily til it was gone, and went on to drink most days socially as apart of my lifestyle. I noticed myself start to drink at home on the off days because it was a habit, and tried to stop. This first period lasted 6 months and it was a trial period. I tried to restart and be in moderation but it didn’t happen.

After a short while longer of daily drinking I met a girl and found that distractions would reduce the drinking. And truthfully right up to when I stopped drinking I was not binge drinking, or drinking in an abusive manor I just decided I was done. 

The sobriety led to a long overdue mental health collapse. A rough psychedelic trip the year finally hit me and all I could see was death, but I was sober. I realized in these times that I coped with drinking through relationships ending, and the unknown process of figuring out that trip gone wrong. With some therapy and time things got easier.

Now I’m two years removed I can’t separate if sobriety is a necessary thing for me, or if my previous actions were in direct response to neglect in other areas of my life. 

I have considered drinking strictly wine or in certain situations only. It’s been really hard after the psychedelic issues any substance has caused negative reactions (coffee, weed, edibles) all induce panic attacks. So it’s easy to see alcohol being romantic. But why does life tempt you to have a substance as a vice? I work out daily, my work is fulfilling I occupy my time, but is it not enough?

Anyways I apologize for the rant if it’s un welcomed but I’m trying to make sense of it all.

Wife works full time from home and we have a 4 year old dog

While talking today, she asked me if I was enjoying paternity leave ..I said more than enjoying i am just exhausted.

Routine is i wake up at 7 am, prepare baby bottle for feed at 745 am, play with the baby, put her down for a nap. 

Then I take the dog for a walk, prepare breakfast for us. Second feed starts , where I feed the baby, play with her and put her to sleep 

We have outsourced lunch , so I just plate them and we have lunch. By the time , I take of other household cleaning/ laundry , the third feed starts.

By the time I put her back to sleep for her final nap the time is 330 pm and I prepare tea/coffee 

Sit down for a bit and baby wakes up in 40-45 mins, and j start her next routine.

Evening is walking the dog with baby, and when wife is doing final routine for night .. I load dishwasher, clean the bottles , pumps , sterilize them and sometimes prep dinner or go to market to buy groceries.


I used to play recreational volleyball twice a week but have paused that cos wife wasn't comfortable being alone in the evening with baby which I understand.

So the question is, should I actually enjoy paternity leave? I enjoy taking care of my daughter but is my wife right to be disappointed when I told her that I am not actually enjoying it , just feel the work load and responsibilities during paternity leave has me tired .

Cool so I went for a hemorrhoidectomy today. It's 9 hours later and I can feel the stitches which is fine I can deal. What I don't understand is why my vagina is totally numb. The hemmroid removed was a size 2 out of 10 the Dr. said, an external hemmroid that just looked like a skin tag.
Nonetheless it bothered me physically when I would go about my day sometimes and I'm youngish so wanted to get it removed. I'm not quite sure it's removed or just kind of cut in half with a stitch down the middle. Lord help me in my petty ways. Anyways I hope I get feeling back in my vagina and I hope that my privates no longer hurt me and are also not numb in normal daily tasks. I never had a hemmroid until I was pregnant. I was downing prune juice like crazy and eating dates and all that loose poop food types. But it did not match the constipation I endured of carrying a baby for some reason. Pregnancy is so bizarre. I ended up figuring out a way to calm my personal constipation during pregnancy, with magnesium, but the damage was done.
I was now a gal with a skin tag in my eyes but an external hemmroid in the docs professional words. I'm sure other moms may think that's gross if you did not experience it or others may think I'm lucky for having it tiny. But if you have hemmroids, I feel your pain. I just couldn't deal with putting butt cream on my butt before age 40 or hell before 90. Call me high maintenance.
Anyways, I hope feeling comes back in my vagina. I called the doctor and was told to wait 2-3 days and the feeling in my vag should come back. Fingers crossed ladies!!! The world is my oyster and I want feeling in my vagina and no pain in the butt hole region. Lord hear my prayer. Peace be with you moms.


I wanted to cook my college boyfriend a special dinner. He liked to eat meat and I learned how to cook him bacon before work with eggs and give him coffee. I felt very domesticated. He was going out for a lunch with an old friend so I ran out to the local grocery to get chicken, white chicken to be exact. I never ate meat, ever. I always liked the animals and my aunt turned me off to the idea of eating them at age two with her very descriptive explanation to my question of what is a hamburger. Anyways, back to the grocery store shopping at age 21 for chicken for my man. I felt defeated after the excursion for there was only pink chicken in the grocery store. I went to the pizza place down the road to mull it over with my meat eating friend whom worked there. She gasped and laughed initially before looking into my eyes to tell that I was indeed serious. I then learned that pink chicken turns white when cooked on the oven. With confidence and a bit of concern for my lack of information on basic topics, I strolled back to the grocery. As I was preparing the meal, my phone rang and I shit you not it was my boyfriend talking shit about me to his EX GF at a bar. He must of butt dialed me. I listened on heart broken, but did I take him back? Yes, at least on and off for the next 5 years. It was always something with that one. Strippers when he would travel with business, or that time we went to NY city and I had this weird gut feeling and begged to ask the question “when was the last time some girl other than me kissed you?”. You know his response, that night! Just like an hour before when I left the room to go to the bathroom one of the like 6 people there walked over to him in a chair and kissed him. What the hell. But was that the end? No I went to breakfast the next morning and that girl was one of the 4 other people at the diner table with me. I tend to give people too many chances.

1jks4p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1jks4p9/the_emporium_part_4/,The Emporium- Part 4,"*THURSDAY*

Today is the day our truck delivers. We only get an order in once a week, so it's usually a lot. Takes a full crew to get it unloaded and processed, so all of us weekday stockers are required to be here. No exceptions. It gets a little chaotic, but I don't mind it too much. Makes the time go by faster. 

By the time I get here, they're usually more than halfway through it all. But today, truck got here late... so looks like I'll be busy until close. Fine with me, I drank an extra cup of coffee this morning, so I'm ready. It's strange, I'm actually in a pretty good mood today; almost excited to go to work. 

I clock in and join the rest of the crew in the warehouse. The openers are hard at work unloading and sorting all the merchandise. Jaden and Janie are the ones in charge of them all. We call them The Bitch Twins. Any other day, they could give a shit less about what's going on around here. But on truck day, they'll bite your head off if you don't move fast enough.

Luckily, the products start off normal when they  come in. They only start acting weird once they've been here a couple hours, so we try to get everything on the shelf as fast as we can. We start with the dairy and frozen items, since they need to be stocked first. I'd already noticed Yogurt Lady waiting by the coolers for a fresh batch, so I loaded Emma's cart up with everything that gets stocked in that area. Good luck to both of them. 

I step over Headless Elroy wiggling around on the floor, and grab my cart. This happens to him every Thursday; old man just cant keep up the pace, and The Bitch Twins show no mercy. His head usually re-spawns by the end of the night though, so it's no big deal. 

""Move it, Elroy."" I say, kicking his shoulder as I pass. He just starts flailing around even more, so I scoot him over to the side with my foot. 

I took the milk, Chris took the eggs, and Paul got stuck with all the freezer items. He was pissed, of course, but I don't give a shit. The only reason the freezer is so hard to stock is because he'd been using it as a body storage, until it got too full. He made that mess, he can fucking deal with it.

Once I finish putting away everything on my cart, I look over to Chris to see if he needs any help with his. He does. He's covered in egg juice, fighting with his extra hand trying to get the carton away from it. I walk up to him, and ask,

""Need a hand?""

He doesn't laugh, he just glares at me in defeat. I turn around, bend over, and the hand drops the carton. 

""Hey, thanks man!!"" Chris says.

Usually I'd clean up this mess myself, but I'm just too busy today. I walk past Emma snacking on a yogurt covered finger, and go over to the wall phone to page Lenny for a clean up. When I put the receiver to my ear, it licks me. Disgusting, I know. But, a phone tongue is better than the last thing it shoved into my ear. 

Lenny takes over 10 minutes to show up with the mop and bucket. By then, the floor is covered with raw egg/yogurt soup, and the Turd Slug is lapping it up. I tell Lenny just to stand there and wait till it's finished. We don't need any bigger of a mess. Speaking of, I should probably go check on Paul in the freezers. *Eh,* maybe later. 

One of the openers must have been shoved outside before 8:00, because I noticed there's one less here than usual. Every so often, the openers get together and choose one unfortunate soul amongst them to sacrifice to The Earlybirds. The openers say it keeps them from ever actually coming inside, but I think they're all just sadistic. Or bored. Thank God they're all about to leave. 

Duffle Bag Man just shuffled in. You'd think he brings that bag in here to shoplift, but it's the opposite. The bag is full when he comes in here, and empty when he leaves. I have no clue what the fucker is bringing here, but whatever it is, it *can't* be good. I'm sure I'll find out... eventually. 

The Hum seems like it's getting quieter, because I can barely hear it tonight. We only have a few carts left to put out, so I leave them to it and head toward the break room with my brown paper bag. I get in there, and Lenny's dripping all over the sandwich he's eating. When he sees me, he stops chewing.

""Don't be mad..."" He says.  

I already know. I reach into my bag, and pull out a handful of sardines. 

""God damnit, Lenny!""

I come back from break, and of course, it's a fucking zoo out there. There's a herd of goats trying to get the Turd Slug, something pink is oozing from the ceiling, Chris is wrestling with his hand who's assaulting a customer, Paul is nowhere to be seen, of course, and all the fingers on Headless Elroy's right hand had been chewed down to nubs. He's gonna be so pissed when his head re-spawns. Oh, and the fucking carts didn't get finished. 

I chase the goats outside, stick a bucket under the drip, fill out the accident report for Chris' molested customer, finish stocking the spiders, then go looking for Paul. I found him in the freezer; he'd tripped over one of the bodies and knocked himself unconscious. Fucking idiot. I drag him out and leave him in the warehouse to thaw out for the night, then throw the rest of the empty boxes in the bailer. 

Tilly and Adam were both working tonight, so God knows what kind of biohazard I'm about to walk up to in the front. I pass down aisle 13 on the way. The Spill That Never Dries is growing.  It's eaten the wet floor sign that was next to it; just as I suspected. I put out a new sign, even though it won't last long, then call it a day. 

When I get to the front, I ignore the various smells coming from the register area, then approach the time clock carefully. No Turd Slug, no Fart Cloud, the coast is clear. I punch my number in, and the time clock hadn't stolen any of my time today. I smile triumphantly, turn around, and Paul is standing behind me; shivering and clutching an icicle. He stabs me in the arm with it and tells me I'm a douche bag. I sigh. Maybe I'll call in tomorrow.

 • Strict Entry Times: Factory Town and Club Space enforce timed entry. If you miss your window, you won’t be allowed in, and there’s no discount on a new ticket—plan accordingly!
 • Buy Tickets in Advance: Door prices can be 2-4x higher than the final tier
 • QR Screenshots Usually Work: At Factory Town and Club Space, showing a QR code screenshot typically gets you in, and matching ID checks are rare.
 • All-Access at Factory Town: Your ticket grants access to all stages for that day. For example, a Saturday Indira Paganotto ticket also lets you see Black Coffee.
 • Stay Alert for Pickpockets: MMW is a hotspot for phone and wallet thieves. Keep your valuables secure at all times.
 • Festival Essentials: Don’t forget your hydration pack, ID, and festival wristband before heading out! I added a check list to this as well
 • Cell Service is Unreliable: Plan meet-up spots before sets end. If texting, add a timestamp (e.g., “Meet by the med tent at 5:30 PM—sent at 5:15 PM”). If lost on the dancefloor, use totems as landmarks.
 • Beware of Ticket Scammers: Last-minute ticket deals often seem too good to be true

I’ve had a Sunbeam Barista Max for quite some time 4+ years and recently it’s started to short the electric circuit in my house. Service centre said repair cost would almost be cost of new machine. I like the machine but grinder can be a bit loud and sometimes slow (holding down to wait). I make two coffees a day, sometimes four. 

My question is anyone experienced Sunbeam Barista Max vs Breville Barista Pro vs Breville Barista Express and can provide feedback?

My price tag wouldn’t exceed that $800-900 mark but just after a capable home coffee machine with an inbuilt grinder. I’m not a complete coffee snob but enjoy trying my best to get nice espressos for my family and friends. 

Thanks for any advice

Today is the day our truck delivers. We only get an order in once a week, so it's usually a lot. Takes a full crew to get it unloaded and processed, so all of us weekday stockers are required to be here. No exceptions. It gets a little chaotic, but I don't mind it too much. Makes the time go by faster. 

By the time I get here, they're usually more than halfway through it all. But today, truck got here late... so looks like I'll be busy until close. Fine with me, I drank an extra cup of coffee this morning, so I'm ready. It's strange, I'm actually in a pretty good mood today; almost excited to go to work. 

I clock in and join the rest of the crew in the warehouse. The openers are hard at work unloading and sorting all the merchandise. Jaden and Janie are the ones in charge of them all. We call them The Bitch Twins. Any other day, they could give a shit less about what's going on around here. But on truck day, they'll bite your head off if you don't move fast enough.

Luckily, the products start off normal when they  come in. They only start acting weird once they've been here a couple hours, so we try to get everything on the shelf as fast as we can. We start with the dairy and frozen items, since they need to be stocked first. I'd already noticed Yogurt Lady waiting by the coolers for a fresh batch, so I loaded Emma's cart up with everything that gets stocked in that area. Good luck to both of them. 

I step over Headless Elroy wiggling around on the floor, and grab my cart. This happens to him every Thursday; old man just cant keep up the pace, and The Bitch Twins show no mercy. His head usually re-spawns by the end of the night though, so it's no big deal. 

""Move it, Elroy."" I say, kicking his shoulder as I pass. He just starts flailing around even more, so I scoot him over to the side with my foot. 

I took the milk, Chris took the eggs, and Paul got stuck with all the freezer items. He was pissed, of course, but I don't give a shit. The only reason the freezer is so hard to stock is because he'd been using it as a body storage, until it got too full. He made that mess, he can fucking deal with it.

Once I finish putting away everything on my cart, I look over to Chris to see if he needs any help with his. He does. He's covered in egg juice, fighting with his extra hand trying to get the carton away from it. I walk up to him, and ask,

""Need a hand?""

He doesn't laugh, he just glares at me in defeat. I turn around, bend over, and the hand drops the carton. 

""Hey, thanks man!!"" Chris says.

Usually I'd clean up this mess myself, but I'm just too busy today. I walk past Emma snacking on a yogurt covered finger, and go over to the wall phone to page Lenny for a clean up. When I put the receiver to my ear, it licks me. Disgusting, I know. But, a phone tongue is better than the last thing it shoved into my ear. 

Lenny takes over 10 minutes to show up with the mop and bucket. By then, the floor is covered with raw egg/yogurt soup, and the Turd Slug is lapping it up. I tell Lenny just to stand there and wait till it's finished. We don't need any bigger of a mess. Speaking of, I should probably go check on Paul in the freezers. *Eh,* maybe later. 

One of the openers must have been shoved outside before 8:00, because I noticed there's one less here than usual. Every so often, the openers get together and choose one unfortunate soul amongst them to sacrifice to The Earlybirds. The openers say it keeps them from ever actually coming inside, but I think they're all just sadistic. Or bored. Thank God they're all about to leave. 

Duffle Bag Man just shuffled in. You'd think he brings that bag in here to shoplift, but it's the opposite. The bag is full when he comes in here, and empty when he leaves. I have no clue what the fucker is bringing here, but whatever it is, it *can't* be good. I'm sure I'll find out... eventually. 

The Hum seems like it's getting quieter, because I can barely hear it tonight. We only have a few carts left to put out, so I leave them to it and head toward the break room with my brown paper bag. I get in there, and Lenny's dripping all over the sandwich he's eating. When he sees me, he stops chewing.

""Don't be mad..."" He says.  

I already know. I reach into my bag, and pull out a handful of sardines. 

""God damnit, Lenny!""

I come back from break, and of course, it's a fucking zoo out there. There's a herd of goats trying to get the Turd Slug, something pink is oozing from the ceiling, Chris is wrestling with his hand who's assaulting a customer, Paul is nowhere to be seen, of course, and all the fingers on Headless Elroy's right hand had been chewed down to nubs. He's gonna be so pissed when his head re-spawns. Oh, and the fucking carts didn't get finished. 

I chase the goats outside, stick a bucket under the drip, fill out the accident report for Chris' molested customer, finish stocking the spiders, then go looking for Paul. I found him in the freezer; he'd tripped over one of the bodies and knocked himself unconscious. Fucking idiot. I drag him out and leave him in the warehouse to thaw out for the night, then throw the rest of the empty boxes in the bailer. 

Tilly and Adam were both working tonight, so God knows what kind of biohazard I'm about to walk up to in the front. I pass down aisle 13 on the way. The Spill That Never Dries is growing.  It's eaten the wet floor sign that was next to it; just as I suspected. I put out a new sign, even though it won't last long, then call it a day. 

When I get to the front, I ignore the various smells coming from the register area, then approach the time clock carefully. No Turd Slug, no Fart Cloud, the coast is clear. I punch my number in, and the time clock hadn't stolen any of my time today. I smile triumphantly, turn around, and Paul is standing behind me; shivering and clutching an icicle. He stabs me in the arm with it and tells me I'm a douche bag. I sigh. Maybe I'll call in tomorrow.

1jks37y,https://www.reddit.com/r/buddie/comments/1jks37y/continuation_of_the_flower_theory/,Continuation of The Flower Theory,"Well, we have another bouquet to analyze! In the scene with Buck and Maddie, while they are talking about him being in love with Eddie, we have a bouquet full of red flowers to analyze!

https://preview.redd.it/vtqm5d6cd4re1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a98143a8f9de11c55b549bae83b6517b95726c5b

(Once again, thank you u/crustynubs for making the graphics!)

The bouquet consists of:

* Red Carnation
   * Deep love
   * Affection
   * ""My heart aches for you""
* Red Aster
   * Undying devotion
   * Passion
* Rose
   * Love
* Eucalyptus
   * Strength
   * Protection
* Red Gerbera Daisy
   * An unconscious love
* Variegated Red/White Carnation
   * Regret that a love cannot be shared

This bouquet is...insane. Just have to point that out before I get to analyzing.

This bouquet is full of bright red flowers known to be romantic. First, we'll dive into the meaning of the red carnation, the flowers they hand out in middle school on Valentine's Day. It means deep love, affection, and “my heart aches for you.” Well, Buck’s ache certainly does ache for Eddie, and we even have him admitting it, saying his life has a big hole in it with Eddie not here. His heart is aching for him, but he can’t let himself focus on the feelings too much or else, which is why we see him staying at Maddie’s house. Not to mention, the only time he’s able to stay the night at Eddie’s is when he’s found a way to suppress his feelings about Eddie. 

Once again, we have the appearance of an Aster, this time red Asters. If you read the last Flower Theory post, you know Asters appeared throughout the bouquets, but never red Asters. Red Asters mean an undying devotion and passion. Well, we know that undying devotion. I think this flower stands out because in Buck’s previous scene, we have him being confronted that Eddie is competition. This flower represents that even if Buck doesn’t admit it, that undying devotion he has towards Eddie can be seen as competition. 

The Eucalyptus is an interesting one. The Protection symbolism is what sticks out to me because Buck insists throughout the whole conversation that he can’t possibly be in love with Eddie because he’s straight. He’s protecting himself from the idea that he’s in love with Eddie because he thinks if he is, then it’s going to go nowhere. 

These next two flowers are, well, insane. They tie together so beautifully in their meaning. It’s important to note that there is only one of each of these flowers, and they are next to each other in the bouquet. The Red Gerbera Daisy means an unconscious love. In a scene where Buck is denying being in love with his best friend, one Oliver has described as “Bucks truth at the moment”, there is a flower that means an unconscious love in the bouquet. So, Buck has an unconscious love for Eddie because he has never felt like it was something he could explore because he believes Eddie is straight. This goes hand in hand with our variegated red/white carnation, which means there is regret that a love cannot be shared. Buck believes this is not a love that would not be reciprocated. These two flowers are absolutely devastating together. That unconscious love that Buck refuses to even touch because he thinks it wouldn’t be reciprocated. 

I left Rose for last, and you’re probably wondering why. The rose is the most straightforward flower here, right? Rose means love. This scene is about love, so they just threw it in there cause it’s the most romantic flower, right? NO, WRONG. This is not a normal rose. This is a deeper colored red rose (compare it to the other vibrant red flowers in the bouquet; it’s a much deeper red). A deeper colored red rose means a desire for a more meaningful bond. Yeah. This one was a shock to read about when researching these flowers. This rose ties the whole bouquet together. He wants this deeper connection with Eddie, but he believes he can’t. He’s holding himself back (as we can see from the other flowers) and not allowing himself to admit his feelings, but this rose emphasizes that it is what he wants.

Alright, I know that’s a lot to take in. We still have one more bouquet (barely) to analyze. In the scene of Buck unpacks, there’s a plant on the coffee table.

[Plant at Unpacking Scene](https://preview.redd.it/gtrsxy0re4re1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=16f573b086e1d17d54ed38fecbe8cdc904c1ab65)

* Monstera
   * Abundance
   * Prosperity
   * Growth and Resilience

Yeah, that’s it. This is a basic houseplant; pretty much everyone who has a houseplant has this houseplant. But, I think it’s still necessary to analyze. The meanings we’ll focus on are prosperity, growth, and resilience. We see this plant make an appearance when Buck is finally unpacking. That’s where prosperity comes into play, where Buck is finally successful in moving forward and thriving. While it’s still hard to do, he’s resilient about it and grows within himself. Just a nice wrap-up of the episode for Buck!

I have trans friends. I went through my questioning phase. I thought it about it deeply in my 20s. And again in my 30s. I knew autogynophelia was discredited, but hey some people could still have it. It's just a fetish. I'm happy as a man. Or happy enough? Who cares? I don't need to make this kind of change. It's not important enough to me. OK, I'll crossdress occasionally for sexy-times. I have dreams of myself as a woman and wake up crying from a mixture of euophoria and longing about once a year, but meh so what. I'm getting older, and it seems now I'll look at porn almost exclusively with trans women. Uh oh, am I chaser? Gross, don't be that guy. UH OH I'm now more identifying with the trans women almost exclusively. OH NO, I'm now looking more at trans women on instagram just...existing. I'm more ""turned on"" (jealous?) by a trans girl in a cute dress at coffee on instagram than in anything on OF. But I don't need to do anything about it.

Then last week a female friend, in a Whatsapp chat about absolutely NOTHING important, used the phrase ""girl, true"" to me in response to a meme.

And I thought i was going to pass out from the rush of euophoria.
I couldn't stop thinking about it for a week. That feeling. I have ADHD, I'm autistic. Having feelings happen to me out of my control is absolutely nothing new - I've had to deal with it all my life. Only usually those feelings are dysregulation, frustration, anger.

Having such an out of control *POSITIVE* feeling happen to me in a completely SFW context out of nowhere was...impossible to ignore. I made an appointment with my therapist (had one already for the aforementioned anger issues I started confronting last year). I told her what happened.

And I broke down crying just reliving the moment.

She was wonderful. She told me don't overthink it, just allow yourself to feel this happiness. Don't think what to do what's next. Just allow yourself to feel this happiness. To start. Don't ask yourself what this means. You could contain multitudes. You could have a masculine side and a feminine side. It's fine! It's exactly what I wanted to hear.

That was yesterday. I came home and spend all night reading and re-reading past resources (basically everything by Amanda Rosen and Cassie LaBelle). Things I'd already read before on dysphoria and had concluded I don't have it, and.....everything suddenly felt different. I suddenly realized that I hate looking at myself in the mirror. I cringe and I want to look away. Except when I'm dressed as a woman, or with a gender swap phone filter. I hate shopping, except when it's for a costume where I get to crossdress. I knew all this. I knew they were all signals. They all feel completely different this week.

I had also discounted ever having anything resembling to a successful transition given my age and ""shape"", but then I stumbled upon a redditor who posted her transition timeline and her before photo is....me. /u/undercoverchloe, you are a radiant gem of a human. I look at your before photo and I see me now - the me I don't want to be. I see you now, and I feel like anything is possible. Thank you.

Every interaction with a woman at work for the last 2 days felt...different. Every woman I saw on the street I felt different. I used to think I had a problem constantly checking out every woman I see on the street. I suddenly realized I'm not checking them out because I want to be with any of them per se. I'm checking them out because I'm drawn to their femininity and am intensely jealous that they get to express it to the world, and I don't.

And i have this intense urge to tell someone. To tell more people. But I don't have a lot of female friends. One I worry is a TERF and I don't want to risk it. One I think will be understanding. I'm going to tell her next week. I have to. I feel like this is tearing me up inside.

I can't tell my wife. Not right now. This is also tearing me up inside. This part sucks. We have a young son. He's having a lot of trouble at school. He's just been diagnosed autistic and is about to start intense behavioural intervention. My wife is exhausted and drained, and demoralized. She is giving everything she can to make his life better (i am too), and it's not enough. He's burning bridges with everyone, and hurting her and others. She is on the verge of tears every night and it's all I can do to give her some time by herself when I come home.
She would be understanding abstractly. We have the same values. She would be happy for someone like me if I was anyone else - a friend. But she's not attracted to women even a little. We used to incorporate me crossdressing into our sex life before, but she asked to stop. She wasn't attracted to me as a woman. But that's not even the main problem. If she didn't want to be with a woman, I'd understand. I just can't imagine doing this to her right now. She is going through so much, life is already too hard.

So I'm sitting in my office, on the verge of tears all day. Not sure what to do. I don't know what to do. The facade I've built for myself over the years is crumbling. I've graduated from ""I'm cis with a fetish"" to ""I might be trans but I don't need to do anything about it who cares, I'm just a brain in a jar"" to ""I have seen a glimpse of something miraculous that i didn't even know what is possible and when I think about I can't stop almost crying"".

What am I supposed to do next? (besides go back to my therapist weekly who i did choose a year ago because she ALSO had gender/trans in her skills ""just in case"" [🙄 @ myself]).",1,1743037204.0,asktransgender,1,1.0,False
