This morning, I was on my way to grab coffee and noticed a little pigeon with only one foot. It was hobbling around, trying its best to get by, and it just broke my heart 💔. I couldn’t stop thinking about how tough life must be for it—like, how does it balance? Does it struggle to find food? Are the other pigeons mean to it? 😔

I know it’s “just a pigeon,” but something about it felt so symbolic—like a reminder of resilience 🕊️ but also how unfair life can be sometimes. I still feel this wave of sadness that I can’t shake. Part of me wishes I could’ve helped, even though I know there’s nothing I could really do.

Does anyone else get stuck on moments like this? Where something small but meaningful just hits you? 🥺

1h21qia,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h21qia/wife_drunkenly_flirted_with_my_sister/,Wife Drunkenly Flirted With My Sister,"As the title says, my wife (28F) and sister (41F) were drunk last night and sent each other flirty texts. I (34F) am devastated and don’t know what to do. We have been married for just over a year, together for 4 years.

For context, my wife and I are visiting my sister and family for Thanksgiving this year. We live across the country, but it was very important for us to be together as a family because my mom unexpectedly died 6 weeks ago. 

My wife and sister are very similar and have been bonding a lot over crafts, coffee, etc. They’ve been getting closer after my mom’s funeral as we all spent a lot of time together.  I was really excited to see them be so close because my wife doesn’t have a great relationship with her family. 

Here’s where things get messy. I’ve been really struggling with my mom’s death and I have been feeling very self conscious about how vulnerable I’ve been allowing myself to grieve openly in front of my wife. When I get stressed/upset, I lean into connecting with her as it balances me. She, on the other hand, is more of an avoidant attachment style - so when she gets overwhelmed, she withdraws a bit. Yesterday we had a big discussion about how she’s not been showing up as much in this relationship. She was defensive at first, but later said how she completely understood and knew she needed to do better.

We were hanging out at my sister’s last night and the two of them went on a wine run. When they got back, we were all on the couch watching TV and I was laying down with my legs resting on my wife’s lap. She was sitting next to my sister texting a bit, but nothing too crazy. Later, after she was the drunkest she’s ever been, I went to drive us back to the hotel. Before we left, she wanted to run to the bathroom and left her phone in the car. I picked it up to get the hotel’s address pulled up on the GPS and I see messages between her and my sister, with my wife asking my sister “Are the small discreet touches okay?” My sister responded saying yes, absolutely, and my wife said she couldn’t help but to think of this song about kissing someone’s neck…

At this point, my heart had sunk into my chest. My sister had previously pushed boundaries with an ex-boyfriend of mine years ago, and my wife is very much aware that this is a sensitive topic for me. I consider this cheating, and also such a betrayal from the two of them during an already difficult time. 

I know the alcohol didn’t help but I also know that this wouldn’t have just come out of nowhere half a bottle of wine in. My wife is a mess and spent all night apologizing, crying and saying she’ll do whatever it takes to re-earn my trust. My question is - is it even possible to move past this? Any advice from others who have had a spouse flirt with someone, let alone their sibling, is appreciated.

1h21p5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h21p5h/me_being_me/,Me being me...,"Am I the asshole for being Me?

Hi Reddit. Hi to everyone.

I'll leave a disclaimer, I like to rant so if you don't like reading, this might be a skip, maybe that is why I am an urrshole. IDK 

I usually am listening to podcasts about Reddit stories from Smosh, THT, and my vice, RSlash.
So I thought I'd post.

Lately I feel like an asshole. So much so, that I am writing about why I feel like I am, since writing is just THE way I can get to communicate with the outside world. IDK why.

So, here's the rant.

Everyone HATES ME. and yes, my name is Chris. (real name) Well, Christian, but I go by Chris.

American-Mexican. Know Hispanic culture (childhood 5-10 year old or so), but have been living in America for +20 years. So, more American than Hispanic? IDK hybrid I would concur.

Hi, so this is the current (11/28/2024) story.

So much backstory my bad.


I am eccentric. I grew up being bullied and ""taking the high road"" but actually harboring such terrible notions from age 9-13 or so.

13-19 I was fake ""healed"" but then I found alcohol. Alcohol became my fake confident and confidence.

19-32 complete asshole. Not that I'm not ashamed, I just own it now because how else can I try to become less of that version of me.

Now I am 33 (real age) and I'm at a loss. I've been dealing with this for about 1 years, but I've been at my job for a year and 5 months. Have I screwed up? Sure. Here and there. But I have made it VERY clear that I am there to work. Yeah, I've come to work hung over, I've even have come to work without any sleep, but I show up. Not just to slack off either. I go in there and I LITERALLY go out of my way to do extra work and sooooo much of it, because that is one of the only lessons I actually learned from my Dad.

4 people out of a team of 11 DESPISE ME. 2 I get. The other 2, I kinda... sort of..get. I am very un-observat... servant. I have literally helped EVERY SINGLE ONE of them, and they still talked venom to our boss. So I stopped even acknowledging them. Petty and unprofessional? Absolutely. Deserved? IDK, and honestly I don't care. I got to work to...work. Earn money, so I can pay rent and not die of starvation. To be clear, I LITERALLY help anyone that I see struggling with anything, however my anxiety does get in the way sometimes if I think I'm being misogynistic or creepy. (Low self-esteem moments).

For context I work in a 6 floor building where 3 cleaning ladies work: 

 - 1st ENEMY works on floor 1 and 2. 

 - 2nd ENEMY works on floor 5 and 6. 

 - 3rd Nice Cleaning Lady on floor 3 and 4, love her to death and is such a sweetheart and we care about each other BECAUSE those two other parasi...persons, no, PARASITES are a team that bully her and me as well. They literally talk 💩 about everyone behind their backs but smile to their faces. Source? I've seen them be nice to a Sheikh, but then laugh that they are wearing a ""towel"" on their head. Smile to a Black security member, then say she was ""The Chocolate Lady"". Vile.

It is divided into two factions.
1) 2 of the Hispanic ladies, hate me because I helped them in their stations without asking if I could help them; told my boss. Cleaning their coffee area, their tables, their patios. I even fill in for them when they take PTO and all they say are negative things when they come back, it doesn't matter if I WENT EXTRA CLEANING toilets and restroom mode and made sure to leave EVERYTHING exactly as I left it. They have said I SUCK. For context, I don't, I'm incredibly thorough and focused on every detail, even making sure all the brown bags in ladies room are neatly folded at the brim...I'm just...I'm not what they claim. That's my point. At home? Yeah, I suck, can barely get anything done, I don't get that either.

2) Two white guys. Ironic? IDK but I do feel like I'm both them and the Hispanic ladies as a coin. 
Older guys. One I go into work with, Stephen (fake name), he literally has told me to my face; ""must be nice not working"" ""I didn't even know you were here"" (fair, I did slack off for a week of coming in late), but then he simply stopped talking to me, which I am more than happy with. Except the reason he doesn't see me, is because I am literally WORKING MY BUTT OFF SOMEWHERE THAT IS NOT THE DOCK. But then he started telling our boss the same 🐂 💩. 

Now, Johnnesious (fake name), he is INCREDIBLY vocal about talking to you, about how other people are not doing work, but Nice Cleaning Lady filled me in on how he would say I didn't do 💩 and didn't work...he's night shit, 5 hours AFTER MY SHIFT, and I was LITERALLY CLEANING THE 💩 THAT WAS HIS RESPONSIBILITY. Desks, trash on the floor of every room of every floor, I DID THAT. He would take the credit for MY work, but I should be okay with it because he only talks to me about what OTHER people are doing wrong instead of HIM telling me, ""hey, did you clean this?""

So what did I do? I stopped. I stopped, not the cleaning of the desks or carpet or my extra duties. No, I literally STOPPED talking to them. They were no longer people to me. They were snakes. Veno-mousse to mee. Otherwise my people pleasing nature would dare to say ""Good morning/afternoon"" even though I know they are being complete two-faced, goody two shoes behind my back. Smiling in my face while they stab me in my back.

Johnnesious had the GALL to ask Nice Cleaning Lady why I stopped talking to him. BECAUSE YOU ARE A FREAKING tattletale!! The two other snake-women told her I was cold and heartless and I had negativity just spewing out of me. I feel crazy. I literally left no details out on this. I am LITERALLY TRYING TO EXPOSE THIS WHOLE @$$ SITUATION WITHOUT NAMING NAMES (except for some because that's literally what they do) and I just feel crazy.


I simply stopped engaging with them. The whole snake thing is simply to remind me not to get close to them. Have not said this analogy to anyone but the Nice Cleaning Lady and my Mom. 

I'm tired. I feel harassed, and maybe it's my karma for being such a dick for so long so I deserve it and take it without blatant retaliation. But man. I get I was a narcissist without even knowing I was, but I'm trying not to turn a page but to change the whole book.

I'm I the asshole?

Everything I wrote is based on my paradigm, my view on MY reality. But I swear this is just what I have experienced. If I'm the asshole, please, tell me how to fix me. PLEASE. I feel like shit. I feel like maybe I AM the problem and my narcissistic tendencies didn't leave and have just gotten the update but no one informed me.",2,1732816573.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I grew up very poor, with a single mother always living with other family members, often in cramped and dirty spaces. It was a very survival type environment, there was no real affection or love. Money was never discussed beyond complaining about bills. I fully did not understand how finances worked, or even basic income. 

I got my first job when I was 17, but it was temporary. I only made a few hundred dollars from this, and pretty much immediately blew it, as didn’t understand the value of the dollar. 

I met my ex-spouse online at this time. Not long after I moved across the country to be with him. We ended up being together for almost 12 years. 
He came from a very middle class family, with two parents with decent income, a multi-level home in the second richest state in the country, with multiple large vehicles, and college funds to go around. 

My ex spouse thought I was naive with money (I was) and said he should be in charge of our accumulative financial situation. 

He seemed to be good with money (lol in retrospect, I think I just confused this with having money in general) so I said that made sense to me. We combined our bank accounts and all of the credit / debit card apps were on his phone. His phrase was always “I got it under control.”

I always made more money than him by several dollars. At the time of our split, I made more than $10 an hour more. I picked up more shifts than him. He had called me the “bread winner” on multiple occasions. I saw my pay stubs, but didn’t see his. I knew how much rent was, how much the grocery bill was, but didn’t know much besides that. He told me what cards to use and when. Discover at the grocery store, Citi at the gas pump, etc etc. 

He would get insanely frustrated if I bought myself little things like a cold brew from Dunkin, for example. This confused me because he would tell me we had money for things like… The 12 foot skeleton, or a trip to NYC. He would bring home expensive box sets (vinyl record collector) and pieces for his sound system. I was given expensive concert tickets for Christmas one year. I was grateful, but suspicious. I had never asked for these things. I always asked the same question - “Can we afford this?” Again, he said he had it under control after “crunching numbers” 

Around this time he offered to show me “the numbers” but I told him I trusted him. I’m aware this was naive of me. I should have accepted the offer.  

We ended up splitting in very early 2024, for a plethora of other reasons. It was around this time he told me I would never be approved for an apartment, or cards of my own, or anything because of “marital debt” (Luckily I ended up acquiring these things, as he ended up becoming violent, but that’s another story)

After I left, while couch surfing for some time, I was able to get into the accounts and see what the accrued debt was. It was $40k in credit card debt. I’m sure some of it may be medical, but we didn’t often go to the doctor so I’m not sure. I still don’t fully know what all of it was. He would always say “You’re sending the cards over the limit” when I would get a cold brew twice a week but I don’t believe I got us to $40k of debt by getting a coffee sometimes. Our cars were paid off by his leftover college fund (they were both in his name- so he got both of them in the divorce) and we didn’t own property besides that. 
Amongst the split, I was made to be the bad guy for “not caring” when the information was kept from me. I didn’t know how bad it was. I was never told. I don’t know what purchases were made with MY money. 

Am I the asshole for not inquiring sooner? I know I was naive, even stupid beyond belief - but the asshole? I’d love to know. 

A little extra info - We had to fill out financial statements before the divorce finalized, and he is still wasting money on dumb shit to this day. He has help from his rich family friends and his parents. My old job closed unfortunately, so I make about the same income as him. I am able to live with minimal debt (besides what I inherited from the marriage), on my own in my own apartment, and budget just fine. ",1,1732816506.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

I’m dealing with a really strange and unsettling situation involving a prominent professor at my university. I’m not sure how to proceed, so I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I’m currently in the middle of a personal dispute with my ex-partner, who is also a student. Out of the blue, this professor confronted me and said, “No hard feelings—but I’m testifying against you. Just wanted to give you a heads-up. Maybe we could grab a coffee sometime—I’m writing a book, so perhaps in a few months.” Then he walked away. The problem? He couldn’t have witnessed any of the events he’s supposedly testifying about, as he wasn’t there. His involvement felt intimidating, especially since he’s powerful and influential within the institution.

It didn’t stop there. He followed up with Facebook messages, claiming he only intended to provide factual testimony and didn’t want further involvement. Yet his actions raise questions about why he’s inserted himself into this deeply personal dispute.

What’s worse is that this professor had been working with me professionally and was in line to be an examiner for my Master's. After this, he completely ghosted me, claiming he’s “unavailable.” Meanwhile, he’s been seen visiting my ex’s house late on Friday evenings (multiple times), and she’s suddenly receiving unique professional opportunities and networking advantages.

To complicate things further, this professor recently secured a major grant and has significant institutional sway. He’s also married with a young baby, which makes his late-night visits to a student’s house even more questionable. Other students have quietly mentioned concerns about him, but they’re too scared to speak up. I’ve even heard rumors that similar behavior occurred at his previous institution, though nothing formal came of it.

I reported this informally to HR, but they’ve said they can’t act unless I escalate it to a formal complaint. I’m hesitant because I’ve already faced so much stress with this dispute and fear professional backlash if I take it further.

Here are my main concerns:

* Is it ethical for a professor to involve themselves in a student dispute when they couldn’t have witnessed the events in question?
* Should professors be visiting a younger female student’s house late at night, especially when it seems to coincide with unique opportunities being offered? I don't know if it's all just plain mentorship - but I'd be lying if I didn't think that this seems quite sus. 
* Does his involvement in my case, combined with his former role as a potential examiner, create a conflict of interest or bias?

I want to focus on finishing my degree, but it’s hard to ignore how wrong this all feels. Would escalating this be worth the risk, or should I let it go to avoid more stress?

Any advice or insights would be really appreciated.",2,1732816503.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I now suspect that the original formula contained another type of mushroom or substance that caused those effects, rather than just Lion's Mane.

1. What would be a good beginner level project for this piece?

2. Is it enough material to make a pipe?
7"" x 1⅜"" x 1⅜"" - Not sure how much is hollowed. 

2a. Do I remove the metal threads in order to find out, or should I leave them there until I'm ready to turn?

3. If I can make a pipe, I see black walnut is a safe wood to use but might this be stained, coated or permeated by something potentially poisonous?

3a. What to coat the pipe with that's safe? Tung oil? Beeswax? Outside only or in bowl too?

1h21jfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1h21jfw/we_traveled_to_china_for_the_first_time_without/,We traveled to China for the first time without knowing any Mandarin. Here are our tips.,"Hey friends! I just got back from an amazing trip to China, and I wanted to share some tips that really helped me out, especially if you're traveling without knowing Mandarin. Here’s what I found essential:

**1. Payments:**  
Payments in China are incredibly digitized, and Alipay and WeChat Pay were our go-to options throughout the trip. These apps worked 99.9% of the time, and we barely needed cash. That said, we did keep a small amount of cash on hand for emergencies. It came in handy at one shop where, for some reason, our Alipay and WeChat Pay didn’t work. Here’s a pro tip: you’ll be charged a 3% fee when using an international card with Alipay or WeChat for transactions over RMB 200. To avoid this, consider splitting your bills into smaller amounts. For example, if you’re buying multiple items, you can pay for each one separately to stay under RMB 200 per transaction. Alternatively, if you’re with a friend, you can split the bill and pay part in cash and part via WeChat. If you know someone in China, you can ask them to transfer money to your WeChat wallet to avoid fees entirely, but I understand this might not be practical for everyone.

**2. Translation:**  
Navigating China without speaking Mandarin would’ve been nearly impossible without a good translator app. After trying several options, Microsoft Translator was a clear winner for us. It has everything you need—text translation, camera translation (perfect for menus and signs), and even a conversation feature that allows real-time audio translation. For longer conversations, such as discussing travel plans with a guide or coordinating with a hotel receptionist, I found it easier to communicate through WeChat. The app translates messages seamlessly, so both parties can chat in their native languages. If you’re going to have repeated interactions with someone, like a driver or tour guide, adding them on WeChat can be a game-changer. As a backup, we also kept Google Translate on hand with the Mandarin language downloaded for offline use, just in case.

**3. SIM Card:**  
Having both an eSIM and a local SIM was a lifesaver for us. eSIMs, especially those based in Hong Kong or other countries, are fantastic because they provide access to apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Google that are otherwise blocked in China. However, to use local apps like Dianping or Meituan, you’ll need a Chinese SIM with local internet. Meituan, in particular, requires a Chinese phone number. My advice? Get both—an eSIM for unrestricted internet access and a local SIM for seamless use of Chinese apps.

**4. VPN:**  
Before our trip, I read endless reviews recommending VPNs like ExpressVPN and LetsVPN, so I opted for ExpressVPN. Unfortunately, it was very patchy. While it worked occasionally on my partner’s Android, it was almost useless on my iPhone and Mac. If you’re relying heavily on accessing apps or websites that require a VPN, don’t count on it working perfectly. Instead, focus on having a good eSIM and local SIM setup. Also, make sure you install and configure your VPN before arriving in China.

**5. Transportation (Didi):**  
If you’re wondering whether you need a Chinese number to use Didi (the ride-hailing app), don’t worry—you don’t! You can access the app through Alipay or WeChat without any issues. The driver will confirm your identity by showing you the last four digits of the phone number you registered with, which can be an international number.

**6. Navigation (Maps):**  
Google Maps doesn’t work well in China, so we relied heavily on Apple Maps. It’s pretty accurate, but it’s a good idea to have the Mandarin name of your destination handy. Apps like Dianping can help you find these names—just search in English and use the app’s translation feature to get the Chinese characters. For Android users, Baidu Maps is the best alternative. And as a backup, keep an offline version of Google Maps downloaded just in case. Also, always have your hotel’s name and address in Mandarin handy with you.

**7. Basic Phrases in Mandarin:**  
It’s helpful to learn a few key phrases:

* Hello: 你好 (nǐ hǎo)
* Thank you: 谢谢 (xiè xiè)
* Yes: 是 (shì)
* No: 没有 (méiyǒu)
* How much?: 多少钱? (duō shǎo qián)
* I don’t understand: 我听不懂 (wǒ tīng bù dǒng)
* I am a strict vegetarian: 我是严格的素食主义者 (wǒ shì yángé de sùshí zhǔyì zhě)

**8. People:**  
One of the highlights of our trip was how helpful and patient the locals were. Despite the language barrier, people went out of their way to assist us, often using their own translator apps. WeChat was our go-to for communication, especially in situations requiring more detailed conversations. If you’re sensitive to cigarette smoke like me, be prepared—it’s quite common in public spaces, including malls, restaurants, and even railway stations.

**9. Hotels and Trains:**  
I highly recommend using [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) for planning your travels in China. Their customer service is exceptional, and the platform is well-integrated with the local ecosystem since it’s owned by a Chinese company. For added peace of mind, after booking your hotel, ask their customer service to confirm directly with the hotel that they accept international guests. They usually get back to you within two hours. While rare, there have been instances where smaller hotels or homestays may not accommodate international travelers, so it’s best to double-check. [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) is also fantastic for booking intercity train tickets. Although it charges a small booking fee, the convenience and hassle-free experience are absolutely worth it.

**10. Safety:**  
China felt incredibly safe, even for solo travelers. Whether we were exploring bustling cities or quieter towns, we never felt unsafe.

**11. Water and Food Safety:**  
Avoid drinking tap water or boiled water —stick to bottled water or water coolers to stay safe. Also, be careful with food if you're strict about dietary restrictions.

**12. Coffee:**  
If you’re a coffee lover like me, you’ll notice that coffee can be surprisingly expensive when ordered over the counter. However, we discovered a brilliant hack—ordering through the **Meituan app** made coffee significantly cheaper, sometimes more than 50% off! For instance, a Coconut Velvet Latte that cost over RMB 30 at the store was available for less than RMB 12 on the app. The best part? The staff at many coffee shops are usually happy to help you place the order, especially when the counter isn’t busy. You can either hand them your phone with the app open, or they might even place the order on their phone and let you pay them via WeChat. It’s a win-win—but do avoid doing this if the store is crowded.

**13. Bargaining and Shopping:**  
Ask your tour guide or hotel staff for recommendations—they often use Mandarin platforms that tourists can't access. For instance, our hotel manager found great options for us within minutes. In touristy areas, similar items are sold at almost every shop, usually at the same price. Look out for less polished stores that might double as packaging hubs; they often offer wholesale prices. Haggling is common in markets, especially for souvenirs. Start at 50% of the quoted price and negotiate. Be cautious with electronics or branded goods; they're often not authentic.

**14. Restrooms:**  
It’s absolutely true that the majority of public restrooms in China have squatting toilets, and they typically don’t provide toilet paper. I quickly learned to keep tissues in my pocket at all times—it’s non-negotiable! If you’re someone who prefers sitting toilets (I know I do), malls are your best bet. Most malls have at least one sitting toilet, so plan your restroom breaks accordingly. Public restrooms, on the other hand, are often not in the best condition and can be difficult to use unless you’re in a pinch. Restaurants, spas, and other service establishments are great options too. If you’re dining out or indulging in a service like a massage or ear cleaning, don’t hesitate to ask if you can use their facilities.

In summary, the lifesaver apps you need are Apple Maps/Baidu Maps, WeChat, Alipay, Microsoft Translate, Dianping, Meituan.

I hope these tips help you make the most of your trip to China! If you have any questions or want to know more, feel free to reach out. Safe travels!",6,1732816155.0,travelchina,2,1.0,False

1h21co9,https://i.redd.it/330ikiikio3e1.jpeg,"Let’s talk, I’m getting ready to make the switch to a vertix 2s.","Good day friends, I come in peace from the garmin subs. As Black Friday is almost upon us I was looking at my Amazon cart and thinking of buying the older Fenix 7x while comparing to other watches I have and want to buy. I keep coming back to coros and trying to justify it. 

Right now in the states I can get the Garmin 7x pro for 750, or the vertix 2s for 700. 

I’m a fan of big watches and currently rocking the tactix 7amoled but I’m not huge on the Amoled, I’d rather have the battery with the always on mode I think. 

Ive done 2 half Ironmans last year and 1 full Ironman. Next year I want to start the first half of the year with serious marathon training and lifting and get back into all 3 sports in the later half. 

My question to ya’ll is, what am I going to miss out on?

Hi all! Not sure to what put here.. So I'll make this up as I go, I guess. I'm 25/F, living in Cali, just looking for some fun folks to DM here or on Discord and kill some time with. Please don't message though if you're gonna do 1-3 words at a time. I'd like an actual conversation.

Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.

Hobbies of mine include:

Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. I just started Dragon Age: The Veilguard the other day. I play tons of genres though. Even toss in a few rounds of Overwatch from time to time.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series. All three of those were so much fun.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Discovered Ice Nine Kills recently and been loving them, too.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

Sherry was exhausted. There was so much yet to do, but she felt so terribly drained, as if all energy and purpose had been siphoned away bit by bit from a never-ending succession of vampires, each one specializing in removing a specific morsel from her overall  being. 

She had just made the amateur mistake of needing a public restroom, only to find leering perverts within. Dragsters proudly using sinks as urinals, casually exposing themselves and chuckling with sinister glee at Sherry's horrified reaction. ""Come to the public library tonight for Storytime, sweet thing,"" one of them laughed, ""We'll save you a seat."" Sherry cursed herself for being so naïve, quickly turning away and exiting, running blindly through the store until finally collapsing to the floor in a deserted aisle, shaking, forlorn, lost.

How much longer would her husband be deployed to The War on Christmas? It seemed as if he'd been on the front lines for years now, drafted during the last regime, never making any headway, always locked in a perpetual stalemate with the Enemy... the eternal freedom-hating Enemy. Why DID they despise freedom so much? What was so terribly wrong about saying or doing whatever you pleased?

The aisle was starting to fill up with people. Greasy brown-skinned folk wearing garish clothing, speaking nonsensical gibberish, surfing high on all the benefits and privileges that the current government bestowed upon them. They flooded her once-sedate & quiet town now, filling Sherry with terrified dread. She quickly crawled away on all fours, past the now-abandoned, closed-down gun section of the store, alongside the noisy café where trendy androgynous peacocks made the simple act of ordering a coffee and a donut impossible, towards the grocery area and where her initial quest might prove to be successful.

It was not to be. The eggs were all gone. Sold out again. Even at the astronomical prices fetched for a measly 4-pack, no thanks to The Enemy. It was at that point that Sherry just snapped. ""Why isn't there any produce here!?"" she screamed, ""I DEMAND to speak to a Manager!"" Heads turned, people pointed, some sighed, others giggled. Two burly teenage boys in aprons appeared out of nowhere and grabbed her by each arm, dragging her away towards a fate unknown.

As she sobbed uncontrollably, Sherry realized that she was living in The Darkest Timeline. If only America's Savior had won, she thought to herself, none of this horror would be happening right now. All would be perfect. Somewhere out there in the Multiverse, there exists a world where everything turned out in favor of patriots and Christians... and oh, she cried, how I wish I were there now. Everyone united and carefree and getting along... it must be Paradise...

I really struggled to find a job in marketing, which is what I wanted to do. 

I was so desperate I wrote a post on Facebook and this man said he needed someone to help with marketing of his furniture stores. 

I went for an interview and he seemed really legit, he said he needed someone to make a new website and make new social media accounts for his stores. We agreed I’ll be paid minimum wage and weekly. 

I thought this seemed perfect, no weekend work and the hours are 9:30-16:30. 

But within one week I knew I’d made a mistake working here. He started to get me to conduct sales, interact with customers, answer all the phone calls, make phone calls to customers, make him coffee every hour, and clean the entire store by my self everyday.  

So on my first pay day I was paid in cash and it was not the amount we agree on, I had been paid £10 an hour instead of £11.44 I told him but he said he will up my pay once I make more sales. Bare in mind he doesn’t give commission but on my first few days there I sold a sofa set for £5000 and he said he’s give me a bit more pay for that. He gave me an extra £5.


I’m still in the job now, but I’m only in it because i need the money, if I didn’t take this job I would have been homeless. 

I apply to new jobs whenever I get the time at work because he makes me use my own device and pay for canva premium so I can make social media posts. I know it’s bad I’m doing that at work but if I’m not getting paid minimum wage and having to fund my tools for work why should I not look for a new job.
  
Whenever I do hear back from jobs I get told I don’t have enough experience. I’ve started to apply to customer service roles, and admin because I don’t think I’ll be able to get a job in marketing with the lack of experience. 

But every job I apply it’s a no. I’m so stuck because this job is really making me depressed and anxious and I get no sick pay. Or any holidays for that matter. 

I keep a list of all the horrible things he says to me. He’s constantly being sexist. I now have to put alcohol in his coffee all day. 

Does anyone have any advice on which companies give jobs to people with little to no experience? I don’t know how much longer I can handle this current situation.  ",1,1732815049.0,UKJobs,4,1.0,False

1h213a2,https://i.redd.it/581xkqyigo3e1.jpeg,Pumpkin spice lattee+ chocolate mint latte,"Forgot to put this on yesterday. 

This yields 24 oz, can adjust for taste and portion size and intensity.

How I brew my coffee so it doesn't get the graininess of the pumpkin pie spice or graininess of the cocoa powder is I use a 12 cup stovetop percolator for this (My normal coffee making method is pour over with a Chemix).

Yes the periculator is oversized for just making 24 oz of coffee but you're also adding pumpkin pie spice or a few tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder.

I'll include instructions at the bottom how to use a percolator if you've never used one.

I also put the mint extract into the water before brewing because mint extract can go from nice flavor to sickening overpowering with just a couple of drops and this helps it from overpowering.

**Pumpkin Spice Latte*""

**Ingredients**

Coffee:

* 24 oz (750 ml) brewed strong coffee
* 2 to 3 tbsp canned pumpkin puree 
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 - 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
* 2+ cups (1/2+ literl) dairy or non-dairy (I mix almond milk with some heavy whipping cream)
* Sweetener of choice

Optional topping:

* 1 cup (237 ml) heavy whipping cream 
* 1 tsp vanilla extract 
* 2 tbsp sweetener
* Cinnamon or nutmeg or pumpkin spice.

**Preparation**

If using a percolator: 

1. Add water to percolator 
2. Add coffee and pumpkin pie spice to the basket 
3. Brew and add a few minutes of brewing time to make it extra strong. 
4. After brewing, add coffee, vanilla extract, milk, sweetener and pumpkin puree to a pot.
5. Heat on medium and stir until dissolved. 

If you're not using a percolator: 

1. Brew coffee like you normally would, use a little bit extra coffee when brewing because you want this strong. 

2. Follow the instructions above but add the pumpkin pie spice to the pot along with the other ingredients.

3. You'll need to stir more so that the pumpkin pie spice does not become grainy.

Pour and enjoy!

For an extra treat:

1.After making your pumpkin spice latte, instead of pouring into cups, cover and simmer to keep warm. 
2. Whisk together heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. 
3. Pour the coffee into cups, top with the homemade whipped topping. Dust it with a little bit of cinnamon or nutmeg or pumpkin spice. 

Enjoy! 

**Chocolate mint latte**

Be careful with this one because a little mint extract tastes good but too much and it overpowers it and it becomes sickening mint so use a few drops at a time!

I also do this in a percolator since I use unsweetened cocoa powder which can be very grainy if not done correctly.

**Ingredients**

Coffee:

* 24 oz (750 ml) brewed strong coffee
* Peppermint extract **do not use more than 1/4 tsp**
* 3 to 4 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder 
* 1 tsp vanilla extract 
* 2+ cups (1/2+ liter) dairy or non-dairy milk (I mix almond milk with some heavy whipping cream) 
* Sweetener of choice

Optional topping: 

* 1 cup (237 ml)l heavy whipping cream 
* 1 tsp vanilla extract 
* 2 tbsp sweetener 
* Sugar-free starlight mints

**Preparation**

If using a percolator:

1. Add water and mint extract to the percolator, I use 1/4 tsp of mint extract.
2. Add ground coffee and cocoa powder to the basket. 
3. Give it a few minutes extra brewing time to make it stronger. 
4. In a pot, add brewed coffee milk and sweetener, stir, put it on medium until it gets to the right temperature you want. 

If you're not using a percolator: 

1. Brew coffee as you normally would, you might have to add extra coffee because you want it strong.
2. In a pot, add brewed coffee, milk, vanilla extract, cocoa powder, sweetener and mint extract **add a couple of drops at a time, It will easily overpower it !!**
3. Set stove to medium and stir (You're going to have to stir and stir and stir so that the cocoa powder is not grainy).

Pour and enjoy!

Or you can add the topping:

Instead of buying expensive shredded sugar-free mints, I take a few starlight mints, put them under some plastic wrap and smash them with a hammer until they have turned into powder.

1. Whisk together heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. 
2. Pour into cups and top with the whip topping.
3. Dust with the powdered starlight mints.

Pour and enjoy!

**About percolators**

The difference between a percolator and a drip coffee maker like what you have at work is a percolator reruns the water through the coffee grinds over and over again. 

It can go from strong to bitter or burnt easily if you are not careful. 

Because it cycles it over and over and over again it makes for a stronger cup and can extract out the pumpkin pie spice and cocoa powder without the graininess. 

I use a 12 cup percolator and this is how I set it. 

For 24 oz / 750 ml I use 6 tbsp ground coffee (not using exact weight because whole bean coffee weight varies).

Use a medium grind coffee.

I would recommend using a disc filter that goes into the percolator basket that will help with coffee grinds, you could also just punch a hole in a regular basket filter (that's what I do).

When you're ready to brew, put it on your stove on high, as soon as coffee starts gurgling into the clear dome on the top, reduce heat to halfway between low and medium I do mine at 3.

Here's the trick, you want it to percolate and still see coffee coming up into the dome but you don't want it boiling but you don't want it so low that it stops percolating. 

So after you reduce the heat that's when your brewing time starts, I do it for about 10 minutes, some people want it a little bit lighter  and use less time and some people want it super strong almost like tar and do it for as much as 15 minutes.

If you are using dark roast coffee, It will take a little less time.

Light roast or blond roast is not recommended.",4,1732814958.0,ketorecipes,2,1.0,False

Most of my irritation stems from her reneging on a verbal agreement to cover half the cost of the fence that separates our backyards. LSS, she’s into me for several hundred dollars that I know I’m never gonna see. There are other irritations too, however I tend to think I wouldn’t even notice these things if it weren’t for the fact that she told me she was going to pay me for something and then just… didn’t. Nevertheless I maintain a cordial demeanor towards her because I don’t want to get into a shit-flinging match with someone I live next door to. The current “normal” is that I’ll take my coffee on the front porch in the mornings, and she’ll sometimes say hello on her way to work.

So this morning my girlfriend and I are sitting on the front porch, both having coffee and she comes out and says “hello” and “happy Thanksgiving” and I respond “hey _____, happy Thanksgiving.”

Then I register this pause and realize she’s still over there looking at us from her porch, and she repeats “hello, happy Thanksgiving” a little more forcefully and when I look over at her she says something along the line of “you, I don’t know your name” indicating my girlfriend. My girlfriend disengages from what she’s doing on her phone and says “oh, happy Thanksgiving,” then neighbor smiles and goes back inside. 

So am I out of line thinking that this is some kind of flex? Like she’s getting into our space until she feels like she’s been acknowledged to her satisfaction? I might be looking at this person through shit-colored glasses because I already don't like her, but I do not want this idea that she gets how to dictate how (or even if) we respond to her to become the norm. It’s one thing if I’ve got to talk to her, but the asshole forcing a response from my girlfriend really raised my hackles.

\-Lattafa Khamrah - Delicious warm cinnamon scent, smells heavier and more spicy than Angels Share, which smells much more boozy and synthetic to my nose. Lasts for around 6-8 hours on my skin. 



\-Lattafa Al Nashama Caprice - Very close to Bleu Electrique to my nose. I initially thought performance was the only issue with this when I was trying it out, but I've received complements on it up to 8 hours after applying it now that it's become one of my daily drivers. 



\-Costume National i - Similar to Layton but again not a clone, I got it for around $40 and even though I think it's more expensive now it's still worth picking up if you see it imo. Can sometimes have dangerously loud projection on my skin for up to 8-10 hours 

  
\-Marie Jeanne Tonka Lavende - Expensive niche fragrance that probably isn't worth the price for most people, but I have a special connection with it since I was wearing a sample when I met my girlfriend. Heavy lavender with an almost gourmand tonka and rosemary note. If that sounds interesting at least try a sample and you may love it as much as I do. One of my signature scents. 10/10

  
\-Antonio Puig Quorum - Most people nowadays will not enjoy this scent if you go out in public with it, but it's textbook beautiful old school masculine perfumery. Wear this alone by a fireplace reading a book with a mug of coffee or whiskey and picture yourself as an old man for full effect. 

  
\-Al Haramin Amber Oud Gold Edition - I haven't smelled Erba Pura but I've heard this is very close. Very sweet  fruity top that dries down into a musky vanilla. Too unisex or feminine leaning for some but I think anybody can rock it with enough confidence. Really great performance too. 

  
\-Azzaro Wanted by Night - Loud party fragrance, I've received complements wearing it and had ""Who's wearing so much cologne?"" moments with this on using only like 3-4 sprays. On the right occasion though this is great stuff. 

  
\-Rochas Moustache EDP - Haven't smelled Tuxedo but this is great for dress up occasions. Smells classy and much more expensive than it is. 

  
\-Armani Code 2004 - One of my first fragrance purchases ever, I've tried pretty much all the other flankers and the new line of Code's in the new bottle, but the original where it all started might still be my favorite. Still gets complements to this day like crazy. 

  
\-Armani Acqua Di Gio - Just like the original code, the original ADG is still great for me. There's a reason this fragrance from 1996 is still relevant to this day. 

  
Lolita Lempicka Lempicka Homme - I actually bought this thinking I was going to get Au Masculin and never received a refund... but honestly it worked out since people say that one is even sweeter, and I don't think I would've enjoyed this type of playful licorice if it was any sweeter. This one is surprisingly masculine and interesting enough to keep me coming back a lot. ",1,1732814913.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False

I’ve included the pie pastry recipe, from a 1949 Crisco booklet. The mixing method is particularly easy- it involves making a paste with water and flour, which makes the whole thing mixed together easier. I live in a dry climate and almost always need a couple tablespoons more water. I can post the pie recipe another time, it’s from a 1916 newspaper clipping. 



TWO CRUST 9 INCH PIE
¾ cup Crisco
2¼ cups sifted flour
1 teaspoon salt
¼ cup water


1. SIFt flour and salt into bowl.
Take out ⅓ cup flour. Cut Crisco (with knives, fork, or a blender) into remaining flour until the pieces are the size of small peas.

2. Mix ¼ cup water with flour to form paste. Add flour paste to Crisco-flour mixture. Mix and shape dough into a ball.
Divide the dough into two parts.

3. Place one portion on a pastry canvas or a board which has been dusted with about one
tablespoon of flour. Roll the dough with short, light strokes, rolling from the center to the edges, keeping it circular in shape. It should be about 12 inches in diameter.

4. Place in pie plate, trim the edges with a knife or a scissors, even with the edges of the pie plate.

5. Roll the other half of the dough to a diameter of about 10 inches. Cut or prick small steam vents. Place on the filled pie, and trim the edges ½ inch beyond the edge of the pie plate

Fold edge under and seal. Flute with the fingers or a fork to retain juices in sealed crust. Bake in an oven of the temperature recommended for the pie filling.

The laser is below the pod holder and identifies the pod and therefore the quantity of coffee to brew. The Vertuo next’s one of several design flaws is that the positioning of the laser causes coffee grounds to eventually collect and block it. 

I called the helpline twice, both times, I was told to dispose the machine and was given a 35% discount for a new one. My machine is not even two years old yet and was a splurge purchase since I’m a student. 
I looked online and here and saw a lot of advice to clean the machine, which I did. I had run a million cleaning cycles at this point, cleaned the upper spinning mechanism with a paper towel and the lower plastic case with q-tip several several times and also descaled once. It was so clean that the plastic case was fully transparent at this time.
Finally, as a last resort, I removed the outer band casing (near the pod holder) and pulled out the tip that pours coffee out and the component next to it and rinsed them in water. You have to be careful when you put them back because the first time I did it, there was coffee all over my kitchen counter, but anyways that seemed to do the trick.

Some further tips now that the machine is working:
My machine would spin forever before giving the error light. Now that it’s fixed, the time between pressing the button and getting brewed coffee is so much shorter. That is one way to identify that it’s a laser issue. 
Don’t give up!! I spent hours trying to fix this machine and every coffee it’s been brewing since, feels like a reward! ",1,1732814662.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

Last year I had an incredibly toxic FinTech job that was extremely stressful and I would think about it 24/7. We would have emergency meetings on the weekends, and would need to triage issues in the middle of the night for the offshore developers. I ended up quitting that position to finish my Masters and immediately started having constant dull stomach pain on left side. I believe this was due to me finally being able to think about things aside from work again, as I was just in a complete state of panic while working, but did not have pain at the time. 

I had a CT Scan and Colonscopy, but everything seemed fine. Other symptoms included indigestion and heartburn. I was put on Lexapro, however this made me exhausted, so they just switched me to Prozac which actually made me feel a bit better. A month ago I also tried stopping coffee and replaced it with one or two daily 100mg caffeine pills. The last month has been great, and my pain is gone most days or at most a 1/10. I had tried quitting coffee for a week prior to this, but it did not seem to have an impact. It seems I just needed to go without it longer to fix the issue.

I started after admitting myself for detox a month ago. I went downhill real fast after switching to vodka and doing the drinking from morning until night routine. 

Antabuse has been great. In 30 days I've drunk twice. 

The first time I drank at a work event. That was four days after my last dose. I drank a lot that evening, and didn't enjoy it at all. I didn't react too strongly. I had some flushing at one point, and perhaps my pulse was a bit higher than usual, but I drank myself stupid, got home early, and continued drinking the entire weekend. I was straight back into the routine. Luckily I put a stop to that once I was back at work.  

Earlier this week I decided to test the waters again. I took my ADHD medication, and drank too much coffee at work. The resulting feeling of stress and tension is one of my biggest triggers. 

I somehow decided it was a good idea to buy a six-pack after work. I drank 5 beers that day, which isn't a lot for me at all, but I actually did get a little drunk. I got some mild flushing, but my heart rate increased to 90-115, even after I fell asleep. The next day my Apple Watch warned me about my heart rate and breathing rate being higher than usual, and during the next day my stress stats were off the charts. 

Of course I decided that a half litre of vodka of vodka was the solution to this. The reaction with the antabuse was still not too bad. The flushing was worse, and my pulse stayed at around 110 - but I didn't get any of the nausea or terrible effects I've read about. I'm never hung over anymore, but drinking a couple of days after antabuse doesn't really feel to different from being a few weeks into daily drinking, balancing the hangover with the cure. 

I'm on 200mg three days a week, which might be too low. I kind of wish I got the kind of reaction where I feared for my life, but really it's just getting drunk with a mild reaction. I got the same symptoms a few times before I started antabuse. The high pulse happens every time when I drink (and after), and I've gotten the flushing a couple of times before too. 

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. Antabuse has been great. I've had longer periods of sobriety than I've managed to string together in a decade. But I wish taking a pill meant that I can't drink for 10 days. Now I can drink two days later, and suffer mild symptoms.",2,1732814123.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

1h20qq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1h20qq5/do_i_stop_hanging_out_with_my_friends/,Do I stop hanging out with my friends?,"A little background to get the idea, Keeping this as short as possible. my friend group is mostly all couples & we’re hanging out all the time (every weekend, texting everyday, etc) and plan bdays & holidays together. There’s 4 girls & I, and 5 guys most of the time, depends who comes. 

We were all spending the weekend away, drinking, and one of my guy friends, let’s call him liam, also one of the girls bfs, tried to touch me down there, I backed away indicating I’m not interested & he tried again so I walked away. It was very strange, he was staring at me with this evil smirk and it was just so weird. He’s always showed interest in having foursomes with me & my bf, and has made multiple remarks about my boobs etc. but we were very close, and that’s his personality like everyone just brushes it off like “oh that’s just Liam being Liam”. His gf has brought it up from time to time questioning why he’s like that w me and obviously starting arguments. And yes he made these remarks in front of her about the foursome etc. but she never did express her concern to me about it, I’ve just heard it from the other girls. 

We were all drinking the night it happened & I didn’t know if it was a big enough deal to bring it up to him so I sat on it and made a decision. So, after that incident I told my bf about it the next day. He was obvs pissed off & wanted to speak to Liam about it, as they were close since birth so it’s a weird position to be in. My bf ended up telling the other guys before confronting Liam, and the gf still didn’t know. I realize it would’ve been best to just tell the gf when I told my bf, but I never. Scared she’d be mad at me or something and also didn’t want to make a scene out of our fun weekend.

So my bf confronts Liam, he’s apologizing and saying he drank too much etc. he tells my bf that he wants to be the one to tell his gf, so we respected that. and then the night goes on. The gf still doesn’t know the next morning as she hasn’t said anything about it to me. We head home the NEXT evening without any knowledge on if she knows or not. That day went by and still didn’t hear from the gf about it, so I texted her to go for a coffee and I was going to tell her what went on then. But her bf got word that I was going to hang w her, so he called and said he wanted to be the one to tell her first and he did that evening. 

(The bf also texted me a huge thing apologizing to me, and I was forgiving and all was good) 

She texts me afterwards, seeming like she thought it was nbd, and we kind of laughed about it etc. and hung out that same evening to talk about it and explained the situation with every detail. All was fine, the ball is in her and Liam’s court now. 

A few weeks go by, everyone’s still hanging out as normal, but none of the boys are speaking to Liam as they are pissed about what he done to me. Liam and the gf stop coming around all summer, as they’re embarrassed I guess and they think everyone’s still mad at Liam. 

The situation was never spoken about besides in jokes here & there. And the guys shared a mutual opinion that it’s just messed up. I was hearing from the girls that the gf was saying xyz about me, and i was taken back because I wasn’t hearing any of it from her. and half of it was just nit-picking me. I didn’t say anything about her, just that she should have enough balls to talk about it with me. 

3 months later, after barely seeing the gf and Liam, I get a huge paragraph from the gf telling me she’s mad at me for what happened and how I handled the situation and calling me a bad friend, basically picking me apart instead of Liam, who actually done the deed. She tells me she’s mad that one of my very close friends knows about it and that it’s embarrassing for her, and I shouldn’t be talking about it. (I told a close friend what happened as she asked why they are no longer around. It was chill.) she also blames me for their decision to not be around all summer, saying she “isn’t going to stop coming around anymore” because of me. She said my bf should be talking to liam and that it’s terrible of my bf to not speak to Liam after what happened, as Liam has done xyz for my bf in the past. 

I was like ???? I never once said she should not come around, I was WAY beyond past that situation since the moment Liam apologized. So I told her I’ve never been in that position and it was a weird thing to navigate, and if I had my time back I would’ve spoken up right away, and not wait for Liam to tell her. I said my bf and Liam have nothing to do with our friendship & we shouldn’t let it get in the way. She came back with another paragraph, way meaner than the first, and trying to throw my bf under the bus for xyz and that no one’s innocent, and everyone’s done this that and the other thing and it’s unfair for Liam to be left out and it’s all my fault etc. I come back again apologizing, but then realized I have absolutely nothing to apologize for as I didn’t do it??? So I sent another message and said you know what, I don’t apologize for this. Your issue is with Liam and I understand you’re embarrassed but that’s got nothing to do with me, you don’t know how to handle a distraction like that until you’re in it etc. and she come back basically saying agree to disagree. 

Another month goes by and I’m hearing from other people that she’s shit talking me and making up lies about the situation and blaming it on me and my bf. She’s trying to hang out with my closest friends (they didn’t) and be buddied up with people she knows I’m closer with. Trying to get under my skin. Whatever floats her boat at that point, she’s going though it, right? 

Well, I had to see her for my friends birthday, we were drunk and she told me she loves me and was sorry for the way she got on with me, and I said it was fine BUT I don’t take disrespect and I called out everything she said that was false (in a nice way) and we concluded that we’d speak over coffee. At this point, I’m uninterested in doing that as she is trying to get under my skin like a weirdo for months, but she doesn’t ever reach out for that coffee. We still don’t speak, it’s been 8 months since the incident. 

I am NOW hearing that she’s still going around to people I do and dont know & asking if they know what happened, and saying she “just doesn’t know who to believe”. As her bf has made 10 different excuses on how/what happened that night and is definitely confusing her. But she is also trying to protect her image and her relationships image by twisting the story & making sure everyone knows her “side” of things. Why is she airing out my business to other people, it’s weird asf. She has always been weird with me, obvs bc her bf is interested, trying to make ppl “like” her more and trying to one-up me, never looks at me when speaking in a group setting, throwing small jabs about me to others or to my face, trying to make me feel excluded etc. giving jealousy vibes. So I never was as tight with her as the other girls. 

So, why I ask if I should stop being friends / going around in general is because: the other gfs don’t want to get involved, are saying “neutral” on the situation and continuing to invite the both of us every weekend and for our group activities. There has been a lot of times where they don’t invite her, but she’s still getting the invite for the big events. I understand not wanting to stop a friendship with someone over drama that isn’t yours, but also I stand 10 toes for my girls and I guess see that in a different light. I don’t ever speak on the topic or tell them what I’m hearing about the gf saying things about me anymore as they are “neutral”. They tell me they’re with me on that whole situation, but know that I’ve set a boundary in not wanting to waste energy hanging out with the gf, and still continue to invite her, knowing I may not be there then. They tell me they just feel bad as her and Liam’s relationship has been on the rocks (like obviously? He just tried to cheat on you with me?) but anyways. I’m struggling to know if I go to the events anyways and just not speak/look at her but on the other hand, why would I waste my time doing that? We’re a close knit bunch and to have 2 people not speaking is just weird. I couldn’t care less to spend time with her, she treated me badly through out this situation, and continues to do so even though we do not even speak anymore. Literally rent free in her head. My friends still are like omg please come etc when plans are made, in hopes that we can go back to normal but I don’t take disrespect lightly and think I shouldn’t surround myself with somebody with bad intentions. Whom I’d have to watch my mouth around not knowing how she’ll twist it. OR do I go around and prove that I don’t care? But also why do I have to prove anything to anyone? lol. I also did try to get the girls to understand where I’m coming from but they only seem to care about “bigger the crowd the more fun” instead of actual good friendships with people who stand by them. Idk. 

I did have to see her the other day as my friends blindsided me and didn’t tell me she was going to be there, as it was a normal night and not an event. Her and her bf were in my ear “oh i love you so much I wouldn’t want anyone else” etc like trying to prove their relationship which was really strange LOL I left the night very early as I didn’t want to be around a weirdo. Also, they are planning a girls night thos weekend, with both of us invited. So it’s going to be 4 or 5 of us girls hanging around and me & the gf aren’t going to speak? How weird is that … do I go and not care or just don’t care to go? Lol 

I don’t want to make them pick a side or anything like that, but when your friend is being torn down wouldn’t you want to stand by them? Idk, should I keep wasting my time w these people, give it a chance? Or respect myself and stop joining. And do I go when the gf isn’t there? Or stop completely? These people just don’t have the same morals as me I don’t think. I am not opposed to confrontation, and will give my honest opinions etc. staying “neutral” on a situation worried to hurt somebody’s feelings or stand up for a friend is pussy behaviour. This situation in general could’ve been done & over with, 8 months ago. I do get that the gf is embarrassed, but to take it out on me and not her perv bf, is just uncalled for & childish. If my bf did that to my friend, I’d be concerned for the friend first of all, and never judge how she handled it as it’s weird asf. Also I would no longer have a bf. I am just dumbfounded how it’s turned into this big of a deal. She’s bringing it up every chance she gets, trying to make herself a victim. Idk if this is relevant but her other mutual friends do not like Liam, and think they should break up and they know about what happened so i think that also set her off even more that they now REALLY don’t like the guy.

1h20oxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h20oxq/i_28m_lied_to_my_partner_31f_about_being_laid_off/,I (28m) lied to my partner (31f) about being laid off and homeless. How do I move forward? ,"Sorry this is a lot.. 

I (28m) met my current partner (31f) at an embarrassing point in my life. I was getting out an abusive relationship, and was basically starting over from scratch in terms of friends, a place to live, and eventually even even my job that I ended up getting laid off from a month later. 

The first lie was not even telling my current partner I was still in a poly relationship. I broke up with my abusive ex very suddenly from their perspective, and with distance. This caused my ex to somehow eventually find my new partner via socials and try to shit talk me under the guise of being worried about me since I’m suicidal. 

Since I had lied about when my last relationship was over, my partner understandably starting thinking I might be cheating on them with the friend(s) I was staying with. 

I ended up cutting things off with them, and staying with my current partner. 

I have to be forward and clear about the fact that my partner and I really fell for each other hard. It motivated me to work towards getting my shit together so I could be a stable partner. 

They knew I was apartment hunting, and that some things were falling through. They were being very supportive during all of this, but there were other things I was keeping from them.

I didn’t tell my new partner I lost my job, and used freelance work as a way to make ends meet while also trying to provide in the relationship. 

Another important aspect of this is that I left my last relationship in such a hurry that I left behind some vital documents. 

I ran into a lot of roadblocks trying to new copies of those documents considering I didn’t want to get them sent to my old address where my ex still lived, and I didn’t have a permanent address for them to be sent to. 

I had no luck apartment hunting. My credit is shit (partly has to do with my last relationship), and I can’t afford a lot of places where I live. 

I met with some potential roommates and became semi decent friends. We all went in on a house together but I got denied because of my credit. 

I ended up lying to my partner about the house falling through. I don’t know what my endgame was. I just wanted them to stop thinking I was such a fuck up for not being able to find anything. 

It worked out for a bit because they always wanted me around, and I ended up house sitting for them while they were on work trips. 

When I went “home” I’d be going to a coffee shop to apartment and job hunt, or to work on my freelance coding gig. 

It all came to a head last night when we had a trip planned and they asked if I had my ID to fly. I told them previously I had gotten all the documents I left behind. The only reason I can think of why I felt the need to lie was because I was embarrassed. I’m embarrassed to be in the position that I’m in, and I don’t want to be the type of partner who has all of these problems. 

I figured I could fix these things silently and eventually not have to lie about my situation. 

My partner still wants to be with me, and I don’t really know why. I want to be with them. I want to make things work. I want to get myself out of my current situation so I can be the partner they deserve. 

How do I move forward?

Tldr: I’m basically jobless and homeless after leaving an abusive relationship, and I lied to my current partner about it. The truth has since come out, how do I go about repairing the relationship?",7,1732813921.0,relationship_advice,30,0.82,False
1h20otz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1h20otz/i_genuinely_cannot_live_like_this/,I genuinely cannot live like this ,"Since I got LPR my mental health has undeniably taken a hit. As an autistic person I’m very routine oriented and I’ve had to implement massive changes that are stressing me out. It seems dramatic but I seriously don’t think I can live like this.

I’ve only cooked one meal since my diagnosis when I used to cook almost every day. It feels like my favorite hobby is impossible to do anymore. My meals are all small, simple, and don’t need any real cooking. I don’t feel like I can experiment with spices and new flavors anymore. I can’t eat tomatoes or onions, my two favorite foods. I’m not even supposed to drink my decaf coffee anymore, something that I’ve had daily for years now. Before every meal I have to look up every ingredient and if it’s okay for my acid reflux. 

I use cannabis medically to manage my autism and I can’t even use my dry herb vape for weed anymore. Every time I cough the acid reflux gets 10x worse. I’ve had to fully switch to edibles since those don’t trigger any symptoms for me. I’m glad I can have edibles at all but I really miss just sitting down at the end of the day and loading a bowl in my vape.

Worst yet, I’m constantly uncomfortable. Before I eat I get nauseous, after I east I can feel the food reflux back up my throat. Even water comes back up, I feel the coolness of it travel back up my throat after I swallow it down.  The constant globus sensation in the back of my throat makes me swallow constantly, sometimes it gets so bad I’m on the verge of gagging. It makes it hard to swallow and food gets stuck in my throat. Last night I even lost my voice, partially from my swollen vocal cords, partially because I got so overwhelmed I almost went nonverbal, something which rarely happens to me. I literally couldn’t speak more than a few words.

I’m going back to the doctor for an endoscopy. I need to know why I have LPR. There’s so many different things that cause it and I feel like medications are just being thrown at me without knowing if they’ll actually help the root cause. I’m so young and healthy too, my body is just betraying me out of nowhere. The medications my doctor gave me, omeprazole specifically, has done nothing, perhaps even made things worse. The antibiotics I have for my sinus infection have wrecked my stomach on top of that, making me nauseous. I need to get to the root of all this and figure out what’s actually wrong with me. All I want to to get better and go back to my normal routine.

She has misused her finances for years and my grandma's will has everything in my mom's name. Social services was called on, by a traveling nurse, when my uBPD mom flipped on my grandma, for sitting in the wrong chair. I have called police for being hit and having hot coffee thrown on me, it never results in my mom being charged.

A few years ago, my grandma signed a lease to me, to prevent my mom from throwing me out suddenly, and changed her healthcare POA to me and my sister. I told my grandma to leave the will to my mom, because it wasn't about stuff, it was about treatment of people. I was driving my grandma to all of her appointments, to visit her boyfriend 60 miles away, and doing her grocery shopping, while I paid for all my food separately.

Fast forward a couple of years. My mom found out about my grandma signing me a lease and had her change her POA. My mom told me grandma to stop accepting my rent, then evict me for non-payment. Lease provided my grandma's ACH info, so I wired the full lease value to her. 

My grandma is now claiming I locked her in my car and made her sign the lease and rent receipts. My car has a feature where you can pull the inside handle, even when locked and it will open. My grandma accepted rent, for months, and signed receipts. She said says she is going to call elder services and say I am abusing her. We hardly even speak anymore. 

The other day, my grandma came to me, and stated I have new rules: I have to take her to the doctor, fix something in the house, and only use a certain space in the fridge. I just calmly replied that she can't place rules on me, mid lease, without my consent, and walked away.

My parents don't allow my grandma in the fridge, they also don't allow her to keep toilet paper or anything in the bathroom, and grandma's room looks like an episode of hoarders. She literally has to take toilet paper, from her room, to the bathroom, each time she goes. My grandma also claimed I've wire tapped the house and listen to them, in the kitchen. I have a security camera, pointed at my door, because they've kicked in my door before. I reinforced the door and pointed a camera, from inside my room, at it, for safety. 

I'm disgusted, in my mom's latest attempt to ruin me. I simply got the lease to protect my belongings and be there to make sure my grandma received the most basic of care. If it was about family stuff, I would have asked for my grandma to change the will or not asked to pay monetary rent on the lease.

But I'm free, and I'm so relieved it's all over. When I was sitting in that coffee shop, this enormous weight that sits on my chest and shoulders just disappeared. I felt the ability to look forward into tomorrow and not feel horribly depressed about it.

I'm sorry that I couldn't just let it go. I wish I was strong enough... maybe if Atmika had stayed with me, I would have eventually evolved past it. But the pain was too brutal. It was agonizing. It's still really hard, but I feel like there is some pathway forward. I hope I'm not lying to myself.

It's tough coming to grips with the fact that you will resent me for the rest of your life. I'm mourning the reality that I can't talk to you ever again... but it's not unfair anymore. It's fair, and I asked for it. It's just hard given how much I'll miss you.

My only true regret is that in the last few moments we were together, I didn't have more empathy for you. I felt so awkward about making you do this that I was aloof and cold, but I should've tried to be a friend. I could've been kinder about it and tried to help you, but I was scared my resolve would waver. It was easier since you were yelling at me and telling me that you hated me and that I never cared about you.

I suppose that line will always haunt me. I know in your heart you didn't mean it so cruelly, but I think there's a kernel of truth to what you said. Is it fair to say that I didn't care about you because I was willing to burn things down? I don't know. I don't think so. I did it because I needed it to be over; I knew that you'd be less likely to talk to me ever again. Truthfully, I don't think you hate me at all or even resent me... I think you know that my actions and feelings are incredibly justified but I'm sure you'll tell yourself you hate me and that I'm a spiteful, vengeful person who never cared about your happiness. I'll just assume that you hate me, that'll make it easier to let it all go. I guess I'll tell myself that that it's a cruel and unfair spot when our happinesses are juxtaposed and at odds with each other. We're probably both delusional. You should recognize that you're merely reaping the consequences of your actions, and I should recognize that the self-respecting thing to do would've been to walk away completely. It's likely little solace to you - but I do actually feel better. I feel seen. And I feel so very free.

Your suicide threat really scared me. I don't know what else to say about that. It was cruel and unfair to put on me, but I guess you were desperate, I'm not upset with you about it. It just really scared me a lot.

Meh you'll hate me for saying this, but I'm proud of you for being honest with him. I guess he's still figuring out how he feels about it... and he's deciding whether or not to forgive you. It looks like he didn't immediately cut you off like you predicted, so its looking good. The truth is, in his shoes, I would probably forgive you.

I know it's fucked up for me to say (and this wasn't the reason I did this at all), but I genuinely think this will bring you and Arka closer than ever. I'm sure you'll struggle through it. I'm sure it'll be really hard in many ways, but you can finally be your full self in front of him and give him a fair chance to be the boyfriend you need.

Of course, given that you have properly renewed your relationship with Arka, I guess that means you and I can never talk again.

Alternatively, if your relationship ends, I suppose you can't bear talking to me... the man who 'ruined your life'. I can't blame you for that. Or, you'll be too ashamed of me to talk to me. Whatever, the end conclusion is that this is probably the end of the road. I guess the writers ran out of content.

Okay, I don't know what all you told him. Tbh the screenshot doesn't even confirm that you admitted to cheating, but it does seem contextually like you did and I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt. If you get engaged here are the things I'm telling him.

* I am SmallSnorlax, the person that Sruthi cheated with.
* We slept together in 2021 once when you were not together and she told me she wasn't interested in me. We stopped talking cuz I was too into her.
* After that we intermittently talked to each other 3-4 times before February 2022.
* In February 2022, we started talking all the time again. I was in Atlanta, and she was in New York but whenever we did meet each other, we slept together quite a few times. This affair ended in July 2022 when I got mad that she wouldn't leave you and threatened to make her tell you. She ended up not telling you, and cutting me off and I was too much of a chicken to do anything about it.
* After that we didn't really interact too for a year and a half, and in Spring of 2024, we talked to each other and caught up a lot at a Raas comp. We talked for a few days, but she couldn't keep talking to me. After that she reached out to me a few times when she was having emotional problems at night.
* In June 2024, I started dating someone and told her that I had to completely cut her off, but that relationship ended within a month and in July 2024, I called her and we met up. There was another 3 month affair in which we slept together several times. This ended on October 3, 2024 when she couldn't bear the shame anymore.
* In November 2024, I was incredibly mad at Sruthi for how she had treated me. I knocked on her door and you were there, so she made me leave. I was incredibly angry and I wanted to tell you right then but instead, the next day I met Sruthi and told her that she had three choices (1) break up with you, (2) tell you the truth, or (3) I would tell you. After that conversation, she told you.
* EDIT: I'm not gonna say I gave you three choices. I'm just gonna say that after I was so upset, you decided you had to tell him.

I'm giving you all this information now so he won't be in for a shock then. I won't tell him anything else, but I recommend you tell him about the first time you cheated, all the girls, the abortion, the sexual assault.

It's gonna be a cold, hard, and colorless life for me without you in it, but at least I don't feel shackled down anymore hoping for something which never was mine to begin with.

As for the purpose of life, it's not tied to Arka. You need to find it within yourself. If Arka is the only thing helping you get up in the morning, then he's a drug and that's not good. Try habitat for humanity ([Volunteer with Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester](https://habitatnycwc.org/volunteer/)). I think you'll like it. If that fails, find something else. You are the most brilliant person I know (in terms of character, heart, love, and so many things), and I know you can find your purpose.

With love,

It always happens to them on every cruise, at hotels, every restaurant, coffee shop, and retail store. No matter what logic or kindness I try to bring into the conversation, I’m met with dead silence and then steamrolled over. It’s insanity. 

Years of the earfuls of their utter disgusting, disgraceful sh@t like I’m nothing but a sounding board or a bucket to vomit their venom onto. I can’t take it anymore. 

No one understands the level of it, either. It’s so much more extreme than “venting”, “negativity”, or “complaining”. It’s emotional, extreme, every minute detail, fast talking, not taking a breath to stop talking, hours long at times. 

It’s utterly toxic.

After calls like this, I either am numb and shut down or I’m full of angst. I used to have to put the phone down to go pee or something and they’d still be talking when I’d get back.  I don’t know what to do after these phone calls. They literally ruin me.",3,1732813432.0,raisedbynarcissists,4,1.0,False
1h20i3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1h20i3o/buyer_beware_peak_coffee_gagguino_kit/,Buyer Beware: peak coffee gagguino kit,"finally got my gagguino v3 kit after a 6 week wait... and all i can say is that i regret every dollar of this spent. now i have a machine that needs to be torn down again and reverted to stock. this kit should only be installed if you are comfortable with building arduino projects from scratch AND have a spare gaggia. 

I'm a master mechanic and have done a handful arduino projects, if i wasn't already versed in electronics id be screwed by the lack of documentation. don't be like me and ruin your only coffee machine. 

  
MAJOR ISSUES: 

PCB was shipped unflashed and non-functional. when i boot the PCB, i get no build number on the screen. flashing the PCB does not make it work, even though the STM programmer verified the flash was completed successfully. by the way it was advertised it shouldn't need programming at all. 

temp displays zero degrees. i verified my thermocouple has resistance, then went thru the steps on the discord q&a. i tried re-programming, checked wiring at least 10 times, and nothing. no activity on the SSR, brew switch does nothing. 

non-refundable/zero warranty so when the electronics of the kit die, you get to shell out for another PCB or revert your machine. buying a replacement PCB means i would be in 400$ for this mod. 

Wiring is beyond a joke. no wire loom, jumper wires galore, leaves the inside of the machine a spaghetti wire mess. this is nauseating to look at. its like 15 wires, are you really that lazy that you can't supply an actual harness instead of a bag of unlabeled jumper wires in the wrong colors?

JST wiring for the screen had two pins wrong, mixing up the TX and RX pins. according to instructions ""i shouldn't need to touch it""

ToF sensor was missing from order. took over a week to get a response to my email, going on two weeks waiting... no point in a water sensor when it doesnt work. 

  
minor issues:

no instructions from the manufacturer. you have to sift thru countless posts on discord, GitHub and youtube vids to figure it out. 

expedited shipping was just a cash grab. extra 80 bucks and it still took 6 weeks.

WAGO connectors are not recommended in the GitHub/discord. why include them instead of the correct crimp terminals? 

locking spade terminals are not necessary. they put the pcb at risk for having pins get pulled out or wires pulled from the terminal because it takes too much effort to remove. 



probably more issues if anyone has any good ideas for the cheapest way to salvage this situation, that would be  appreciated.  as much as it would be cool to have the gagguino mod, im not interested in risking another 100$ for a product with this warning on it:



""Non Returnable – experiment prototype sample""

 ""THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES OR GUARANTTIES ON ANY BOUGHT ITEMS, BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. Proving who’s wrong is not the scope of the project as this isn’t a commercial service""

We both lived with my father for the past 13 years. Me because I was a teenager then taking care of our dad. Since being out of school I have not gone even 6 months without a job. I paid rent and bought food/items for the house. The moment I got a car I took PTO for Dad's appointments and anything else he would need. Him because... Well he's him. In that time he never had a job for more than 2 years. He had a total of 3 jobs that I can remember. Baking for a cookie company, working at a factory (a job with me that I helped him get) and a chain restaurant. He quit the last one in 2021, because they were talking about requiring masks in the back again. He did not get another job. Our father told him December of last year ""you have until February to get a job or get out"". He went to ONE interview. February rolled around and he told dad ""I have a construction job lined up for April"" so dad gave him an extra 2 months. The job never came. So he was given the boot, he now lives with my other brother (the second youngest of us all). Before all of this, any time dad tried to push him my brother would bring up the past, because dad wasn't all that great or present growing up. He was a military man, then when he was released front he military, after serving 21 years, he was almost always on the road as a trucker)

While he was unemployed and living with us the only ""chore"" he had was to cook him and dad dinner and he couldn't even do that on a regular basis, then would get mad at me when I decided I wanted to cook for us all. EVERY TIME I'd start cooking, it was ""I was going to make X for dinner tonight, but I guess now I can't"". When he cooked he made a mess, so after I spent over 4 hours in the kitchen cleaning it and scrubbing the stove top, I asked if he could just wipe down with a wet sponge after he finished cooking, he couldn't be bothered. (Before the first clean the stove was so dirty that when I tried to cook an egg something smelled like it was burning, turned the fire off and there was still a fire in the eye. That was my last straw) He laid on his bed all day and night and complained that something was hurting but his insurance was fucked up, but when I'd offer to drive him to the welfare office, before I go to work, to get his insurance worked out, he'd always refuse.

Yes, dad was in the hospital for 2 days, but it was due to dehydration because THIS asshole convinced him he didn't need to actually drink water and that soda and coffee was hydrating enough. 

There's a whole laundry list. Including that he has to rely on me to keep him out of jail, by paying half of his restitution, but if he here all day typing that stuff up.

These drinks, which promise a mildly intoxicating effect without the typical hangover in the morning, are available in different varieties, including cocktails, teas and even coffee drinks. They are particularly popular not only with young people, but also with older customers, such as a retired couple who were looking for a solution for better sleep, reports Die Zeit.

The legalization of THC-containing drinks goes back to the 2018 Farm Bill, which allowed the cultivation of hemp for industrial purposes. In Minnesota, a law was passed that legalizes THC drinks and foods up to a certain THC content. Up to ten milligrams of THC are permitted per drink.

90% of the year we make 4 drinks a day (two morning, two lunch). Two cortados, and two latte. I prefer a more intense espresso, she prefers a lighter roast. Both are single shot drinks.

I'd like something relatively straightforward, I'm not ready to go hog wild and with small kids frustration isn't something I need more of. But I'd like a nice, tasty and meditative experience for my coffee.

I don't have TONS of room, but should be able to handle something around the size of the above options, so under 16"" in height and ideally not more than 18"" of width.

We are in a two story home, bedrooms upstairs so noise isn't as critical but would be nice to not be crazy loud

I'd love a double boiler, but don't have the budget for that at this time and am OK with the delay/slow down having to make the espresso first and the coffee second.

I spent two days on ordering a custom build from ikea. He agreed to everything then when I went to order from the ikea planning studio they had to reduce bench space by 20cm. I didn’t see the issue, paid and had the items ready to collect today. He went off his head over the 20cm, told me to forget the whole thing and he will do it himself. 

It’s been such a hassle to cancel and get the money refunded and I pointed out we could amend the order. No he said I’m not thinking rationally and to cancel all my work and he will do it how he wants

So I said what’s the point of me doing anything for you if all you do is complain (I bought him a Tom Ford perfume. He’s selling it. I bought a rug. He agreed to it then said I bought the wrong colour) I bought a coffee table - he didn’t like it. I bought curtains . Returned. I spend my days buying and  returning stuff

So I said I wouldn’t do anything more for him including his travel expense reports for his work. 

He replied: I will initiate a forced sale of the house if you haven’t secured a job that can accommodate your mortgage by the end of March. And that this is all my fault.

Things are looking up and there are signs of better things to come. We have a few daily green candles going and the community sentiment has shifted there are more workers grinding for their bags than there were at ATH's if this doesn't show conviction in a project idk what does.

The sellers will run out of tokens eventually no matter the wallet size it's about preparing for that time so once we start to move more people will know the name and know what we are doing.

The more workers we have the more the general crypto population sees this and the more we are primed so that when we start to gain traction the more people will ape.

Our Dev has doxxed at the bottom when sentiment was the worst showing true conviction in the project and securing the fact he will stay here through the tough times. I don't see any other coins dev doxxing at the bottom or even at all they will just launch a new coin next week if the one they launched last week fails.

Our 90% retracement from ATH has seen so much redistribution and many of the snipers/early investors taking profits and dropping their bag sizes 730B has been sold by wallets which bought before 9 may (aka first time we went above 30m). If we don't include CEX's we have the most decentralised token right now so no one can dump the chart once we start moving. We have seen this in other coins like $GIGA which had 1 wallet destroy the chart from $600m mc to $200m mc in one sell.

HODLing can be a difficult game especially when trading with emotion but I have never been more bullish on a coin that's down 90% I think Murad's comment is so good about these times. If the coin survives this (which it has) it has only the real ones left and they are running it up.

Seeking a more enlightened destination, he dreamed of a promised land where parents weren’t related before marriage, where grown men didn’t drape themselves in orange tablecloths, and where Hellcat drivers didn’t evade field sobriety tests. 

Along the way, he was joined by men of questionable foresight and dubious ethics, yet together they pressed on, united in their quest to establish something truly special.

Their mettle was tested by enemies both outside and within. As the year ended, they gathered around the server fire to celebrate their survival, bearing the scars of countless battles. They spoke of wielding the mighty ban hammer against trolls and shit posters, their takedown fingers worn from endless memes and game chat debates.

“Remember the battle over the new OC?” u/ExternalTangents asked. “Almost as brutal as the Lane Train wars,” u/Garyp714 replied. After a pause, they all laughed: “They were equally irrelevant!”

The mods stared into the fire, pondering what had brought them to this strange yet noble place. Their hopes and dreams flickered like the flames—warm but slowly fading. *“At least nobody in my real life knows what Reddit is,”* they all thought, a shared, unspoken truth binding them together. The air grew heavy with the rich aroma of roasting Four Loko-plumped ibis.

“Better to be Reddit mods than drug dealers, glue sniffers, or FSU grads,” u/ItsThatCoolGuy quipped.

“You said ‘criminal’ three times,” u/Zlatandiego shot back, grinning.  

“Gentlemen,” u/GreyPic declared, raising his coffee mug, “Today we honor not just our subreddit’s survival, but the unyielding spirit of Gator Nation!”

It is painless, and there are no other symptoms except that it is really annoying. In my opinion, they seem to be regressing, but they are still present. They occur randomly, usually after waking up, and initially lasted for several hours before fading away on their own. There would then be several days without any, and then they would return again. I noticed that they started appearing after I had worked long hours, literally from 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and then from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM, while drinking a lot of coffee and Monster energy drinks. At first, I wasn’t concerned, but now I’m starting to worry, although I think they are in regression. There have been no episodes for about 10 days, but they appeared again, although for a much shorter time and with much lower intensity.

I think it’s worth mentioning that I have been under a lot of stress since the summer (August), and I’m constantly exposed to stress, sleeping 5-6 hours a night, and working at a computer. I visited several general practitioners while I was in Croatia, and they weren’t concerned at all. They said it’s completely normal and that it’s something everyone has to experience in life. They also mentioned that some people live with it their whole lives and simply come to terms with it. They didn’t refer me for any further tests, as they felt that what I described was nothing to worry about and just told me to relax.

Whenever they appear, I panic and always think the worst, based on what I’ve read online, even though I know it is absolutely benign.

Since I am 22, young and constantly exposed to stress and panic because of this, I just want advice and peace of mind from an expert like you, so I can relax. The doctors have told me to continue living as I have been.

I also have an issue with a nerve inflammation in a tooth that has not been fully treated, and I wonder if it could be related to that, as it’s a top tooth, and the fasciculations are on that side of my head.

Because it's FUN AF and SO SATISFYING to manifest for others. 

Not JUST that, there's one MORE thing - 

🪿 **If I am manifesting for YOU then those limiting beliefs that have been delaying your manifestations?? They simply DON'T MATTER!**

How COOL IS THAT!

**Sure, it might happen earlier too. But the extra time removes any sort of pressure form my mind** because you very well know that a calm mind manifests best. 🩷

🪿 **Do I need to see your pictures or know your actual names?**

🐣 NOPE! 

Shocking as that may be for you to hear that but nope, its not necessary to know all the details. 

All I need to know is your desire so I can focus on that and build my scene around THAT! 

You don't need to worry about ANYTHING ELSE APART FROM THAT! 

🪿 **Is there a cap to what I can manifest?** 

🐣 Nah! 

As long as your desire falls under the **Golden Rule?"" I'm golden hehe 🥳

🪿 **How do you sign up for that?** 

🐣 DM ME and I'll let you know if I have any spots available and how soon I can accomodate your requests. 

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUPPORTING ME, you guys. 🌻

You ROCK! 🥳

Also, I am soon going to be setting up my own Patreon, with exciting new content, subscribed content (for as little as 5 dollars a month! Yes!) and many MANY NEW POSTS! 🥳

Also dont worry, the advice andposts I make here on SATSing and Neville Goddard subs are always going to be free and available for you guys!

For context I have a barista job in my hometown I go back to during breaks from university so I'm at least familiar enough with most coffees. I'm also a very non-confrontational person with diagnosed anxiety 😭

I dropped by the university cafe to get a matcha iced latte with vanilla while it wasn't too busy for about £4. I can't drink hot drinks atm because of an issue with one of my teeth. The woman at the kiosk repeated my order my back to me and said ""iced."" But after that I think she either misheard me or hit a wrong button (we've all done it). 

A different girl was making drinks and called out a hot vanilla matcha latte and no one claimed so I asked around and realised it was meant to be mine. I said ""sorry i think this is meant to be mine but i ordered it iced, please can i have an iced one?"" and she told me she'd remake it.

I have absolutely no issues with any of this, we've all messed up and its easily fixed.

However. She took the hot, steamed milk latte and poured it in a cup with ice and gave it back to me. She couldn't even fit it all in the cup with the ice.

Predictably the ice melted immediately and it was a lukewarm mess. I actually had to get the original girl who took my order to remake it because it tasted so bad (I did walk away and try to drink it because I'm so non-confrontational but I got so depressed about spending money on basically lukewarm crap that I had to go back). 

TL;DR I ordered an iced latte and was given half of a hot latte poured over ice 💀

I'm not going mental or being a Karen? It really did taste awful. But I feel like I've committed treason 😭

Neither has my husband but he has worked at a Target that has a Starbucks and I think maybe once he got asked to go “help out” over there, AKA be the barista’s gopher, not actually make drinks or anything. 

Anyway, a recent argument between my husband and I brought me here. I was trying to do an Order Ahead and placed an order for a double chocolate chip Frappuccino for my husband and a gingerbread latte for myself. Well, at checkout it said both items were sold out. No biggie, so I changed his to a vanilla bean and mine to pumpkin spice. No dice, both still say sold out. I test it with just a brewed coffee and it says that’s fine. Then when I back out of the checkout process, it now shows me all of the items that are out of stock, and it’s a lot. Like almost the whole drink menu. Some categories had 1-2 drinks available while others, like the crème Frappuccino’s, were completely gone. I said “It’s fine, I actually wanted [other coffee chain] anyway” and my husband gets annoyed. He says I should just go ahead and drive to Starbucks and order at the drive thru “like a normal person”. He says there’s no way all of those drinks are truly unavailable and I said you never know. The next closest Starbucks to this one is a full 30 minutes away, so the demand is high. I told him I was trying to save time; not to mention he knows how much I HATE ordering at the drive thru as someone with auditory processing disorder. It’s embarrassing. If someone doesn’t enunciate clearly, or the speaker is fuzzy or too quiet or the rest of the environmental noise is too loud, I can’t hear and I have to make them repeat themselves over and over. 

Anyway, so I just went to other coffee chain but he was annoyed because he doesn’t like coffee and no other coffee chain has a desirable substitute for a Frappuccino. No one can make hot chocolate like his favorite gas station and he doesn’t like fruity refresher-type drinks.

""Clearly the American experiment in the 18th century was designed to create and maintain - sustain - the smallest government in the history of the world. That was the goal of the Founding Fathers. The specific goal was to create the smallest government in the history of the world.  

   

Now, if I say that I have come up with some cure for AIDS or HIV infection or whatever. Then if I say, you know, drink this coffee and you'll be immune to the infection, or the infection will be .00001% of the population and everybody drinks my medicine and then we end up with the largest AIDS or HIV infection epidemic in the history of the planet - that is specifically inflicted upon those who took my medicine - then clearly we can say that my medicine is not only not working it is doing the opposite of working. It's causing people to get infected rather than curing them. That would be the logical conclusion that if everybody who takes my medicine which is claimed to be a cure ends up getting sick. Then clearly it's not a cure but rather an infection.   

   

 So if we look at the history of the United States, the grand experiment in minimal states - in small government. If we look at the history of it over the past 200+ years, it's clear that while the system was objectively clearly put in place with obviously no income tax, tiny federal government, no state tax, just a couple of excise tariffs, no standing army, and no government control of the money supply, no national debt, with a Constitution, Congress, all of the checks and balances. An amazing designed system of checks and balances. I couldn't do any better. Maybe you could, but I wouldn't put a lot of money on it because there were pretty smart people who were doing this.   

   

 The U.S. experiment was specifically designed to create the smallest possible government and to sustain control over the government.   

   

 The goal is to cure the power of the government, right? That was the goal. That is what it was designed to do.   

   

 And...   

   

 What has the result been?   

   

 Just look at it objectively.   

   

 The goal of the American experiment was to create the smallest possible government that the history of the world had ever seen. Ever.   

   

 What is the result of that experiment been?   

   

 Well, the result of the experiment to create and sustain to create and sustain the smallest possible government in the history of the world has been the creation of the largest, most powerful government that the world has ever seen.   

   

 Just take a moment, let that bubble through your cranium for a bit. It's really quite astounding. Weapons of mass destruction with 700+ military bases overseas. With the capacity to wipe out all life on the planet many times over.  A government whose power would make Rome look like a local DMV office.   

   

 This is natural. Sadly, it's inevitable.   

   

 Because the smaller you make a government in the beginning, the faster the economy grows - the more productive is the free market. Because the free market is so productive it can handle a lot of taxation, a lot of growth in government power before buckling.   

   

 So, what happens is when you make the government small, you make the profitability of increasing the size of the government that much greater. Because there's more wealth to tax, there's more resources to control, so you attract more and more government. And because the government ends up with so much money when it taxes and controls a quote 'free-market economy,' because the government ends up with so much money and power, it can do things like develop weapons of mass destruction, have a permanent military-industrial warfare-welfare state. It can buy up massive sections of the population and embed them into dependence on the state.   

   

 It's like if you find a way to get your cows to produce ten times as much milk, all you do is make those cows more valuable to be owned by farmers.   

   

 So when you have a small government, and you make each individual citizen that much more productive because of a lack of government interference, that citizen becomes that much more profitable to rule from the state.   

   

 The smallest governments always produce the largest governments.   

   

 It's completely impossible for it to occur any other way.   

   

 It never has in history, never will.   

   

 The smallest government that came out of the separation of church and state in the taming of the aristocracy in England, in the 17th - 18th - early 19th century, that was the smallest government in Europe. What did it produce? Why - it produced the British Empire.   

   

 Whenever you minimize government, you increase the value of the economy, which means that the government can grow larger and larger.   

   

 It's like the further you push it down, the higher it bounces.   

   

 So even if we were able to get back to some magical constitution-limited government, all that would happen is the whole process would start all over again.""

1h1zqzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1h1zqzn/update_talked_to_my_crush_about_it/,Update: talked to my crush about it.,"This is the update to my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/s/ymB4Y450Tf

I talked to him yesterday. I asked if we could go for a walk (we do that a lot) because I wanted to talk to him about something. After work I came to his building and met him outside to go walking around the city. We walked for a couple of blocks before I could say anything. I didn’t know where or how to start. Then I just said it: I have a crush on you and it has been hurting a lot. He asked how long did I know for, and I said a couple of months.

I still don’t know how I feel for telling him, it hurts like crazy. When we were walking I cried a bit here and there trying to contain myself. Phrasing this was very hard. I just told him that I really loved him as a friend and that I was sorry to put him in this situation. He asked me how I thought we should proceed, and also that he is unavailable. 

I knew he was, so I don’t know what I told him for, but I do really hope it was the right call. Before I told him he said there would be nothing I could say that would change things. But that’s because he didn’t know what I was going to say. 

He opened up about one time he had the same feelings for a friend, and that he told his friend too. His friend’s reaction was to step back, not hanging out with him anymore, and to make it worse they used to work together, so it crushed him to have to see him at work but not talk to him. He said in the end that was for the best, and that it really did destroy him at the moment, but looking back it was the right thing to do. He doesn’t have feelings for him anymore. It worked.

But I don’t want us to distance from each other. I just don’t. He told me we are still going to be friends, but that things might change. For starters we are no longer going to have sex. I will fucking miss it so much. But I guess it might be the best way to approach it. I hope it is only for a while though, I really want to do it again with him. 

We kept walking being quiet at moments and talking after the pauses. He was extremely nice, and I will be forever thankful for this. When we returned and said goodbye we hugged, but I didn’t want to let go. I started crying when we did. I cried a lot at this point, and told him I was going to keep walking for a while, so he joined back. Before I realized we were sitting in a coffee shop. He was very gentle with me, I can tell he didn’t want to hurt me, although that is inevitable. You could tell he has been in my position before, and he said he knew exactly how I felt because of this. I didn’t want to say some things because I didn’t want to come across as intense, but he insisted I should say it. So basically I said I couldn’t stop thinking about him, and that every minute of my day I wanted to hang out with him and every message I got I’d wish it was his. He understood me.

I asked him not to cut me off or stand back because that would destroy me, and that I really really didn’t want to feel that. He said we are still hanging out, but even if I hope with all my heart we don’t, I feel we are going to distance ourselves from each other. This is what I feared of telling him, but here we are now. I feel like shit and kind of regret saying it. He asked why was I worried, and I replied that I am scared of not having him in my life. I feel like I’m loosing my best friend over something I can’t control. I’m not just loosing a random guy I fell for. I really don’t want to lose this.

Life sucks.

I don’t have anyone to talk about this at all, so thanks a lot for reading and sorry for the long post.",7,1732811418.0,gaybros,4,0.82,False
1h1zqt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1h1zqt9/a_payday_loan_of_spoons_burnout/,A payday loan of spoons (burnout),"More of a rant than a discussion, but here it goes. 

This rant revolves around two topics, which I will define here.

1.) **Payday Loans**.  For those unfamiliar, payday loans are high interest, short term loans.  Something like ""can I borrow $30 today, and hit you back with $50 on Friday.""  While sometimes we are in a financial position where we *need* that $30 today, regardless of future consequences, these are terrible things that almost always end up leaving you in a worse place than you started.  After all, if this paycheck was $30 shy of making it to next payday, how will [paycheck-$50] make it? So people end up in a cycle where they borrow a little, then next payday, a little more, then a little more, until they are in so far over their head they end up losing their car or their home.

2.) **Spoon theory**.  I am sure most people here are aware of the spoon analogy for energy, but just in case, a brief explanation.  The idea is that every day you wake up with a certain number of spoons, let's say 10.  Each thing you do that Dat has the ability to add or subtract spoons.  Maybe you love coffee, and having a cup in the morning gives you +1 spoon.  Maybe you hate your job and having to go there takes away 5 spoons.  At some point in the day, you hit a wall, and can't seem to convince yourself to do anything anymore-you've run out of spoons.  That means you don't have enough spoons to go to that after work party, or hang out with a friend even though you were looking forward to it.

Theory: burnout is just the result of us taking payday loans for spoons, and getting overwhelmed.  We reach zero spoons, and *need* those two spoons to get through the rest of the work day. So we tough it out, borrowing those spoons from our next payday.  Then we finally get to sleep, wake up with less spoons, and try to make it all work again with even fewer spoons than before.  The cycle continues, and we end up taking on new spoon-debt earlier and earlier each day, eventually even multiple times a day.  We reach a point where we wake up, and instead if finding our spoons refilled, all we have is debt. It even sours things that used to give us spoons, like that morning cup of coffee I mentioned.  That plus one spoon instead goes to our deficit, and the fact that we are doing the spoon earning things and not receiving our spoons makes it so stressful that we stop even earning spoons to pay down the debt. Now coffee isn't an enjoyable part of your wake up routine, it's a necessity to keep the debt collector sated, and all it does is fill you with stress about how many spoons you owe. 

Welcome to burnout.  Now you, like me, spend most nights awake instead of sleeping to regain spoons.  Things that should bring you spoons bring you nothing but worry about how long these spoons will last, if they haven't already been claimed. 

I won't try to convince you to eat healthy so you can live a other 80 years, or give up smoking, drinking, and drugs to live another 50. Those are abstract amounts of time that it is difficult to conceptualize.  But I will ask you that, should the opportunity arise to rest, or take out a spoon loan, you choose rest. Not for decades from now, but for tomorrow morning.  So you can wake up, check your spoon balance, and enjoy.

1h1zptf,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1h1zptf/i_wish_i_never_met_him_on_bumble/,I wish I never met him on Bumble ,"I met a guy in October 2020, on Bumble. It was COVID time and I recently got admitted to my first college. I got my first phone and it really piqued my curiosity for everything. I downloaded multiple apps, including dating apps. I was so fricking new to this side of the world. I never talked to any guys before until this day when I swiped right to a few guys. Now, I was really shy and very insecure of how unconventional I looked. So I uploaded i really simple selfie. I wasn't sure if I'll get any matches. But to my surprise I ended up with a few guys. I started talking and learning more abt this online chatting. It was only my fourth day on that app when I came across this one guy, and i immediately swiped him right. He was so so handsome, his bio was catchy, he was only a year older to me, and lived nearby. On the same day, he swiped me right after sometime and we matched. And it began..
We started talking and I found him so charming. He was extremely funny, extremely attentive, and he was such a great listener. For the first time I was feeling that feeling of butterflies in my stomach. We started talking everyday.  I use to attend online classes in the morning and wait for the evening to message him and talk to him. We did started sharing more and more, including our childhood stories, list of favourites and hobbies. The more he talked the more I realised how little do i know about the world. Every place, every book, every song, every trend, every food, even the names of different colours, bruh I felt I know nothing. But I was glad to learn and more about how patient and respectfully he taught me. We then switched to WhatsApp. 
We continued talking. All this time, one part of me was getting so fricking attached to him, the other was scared, because my parents had no idea that I was doing this. So as soon as we shifted to WhatsApp, i uninstalled all the dating apps. Again, because I was so shy, insecure and also because my parents were comparatively very strict back then, I refused multiple times to meet him in person 
, something he was really passionate about. So we continued talking online. I slowly started observing how less and less he was showing interest in our convos. He was once sharing his story of a recent trip that he went with his friends group. He showed me pics. The girls in the pics were beautiful. And so I did the most obvious thing an insecure person would do. I told him that he and one of his friend would look good together. He simply laughed and didn't say much. Over time he told me about his exes . And and.... He told me everything. That was my first time hearing the freaky things. And eventually, I and him we did , too started talking freaky n dirty. We did ended up with many sexting sessions. 
I got more and more attached to this guy, and that's when I saw him pulling away. It started triggering me and so I started texting him more and more. I confessed to him about my feelings, I told him I see our future together, I even saw ai baby face generated. Oh boy ! I was so so scared of loosing him that I did too extra that actually pushed him away. He started taking hours to reply, and all those hrs I kept panicking and checking my phone every single minute. It got to a point where I got so fricking obsessed with him that I use to cry to bed. And so one day I woke up and blocked him. 
Months went by, and I did no progress in forgetting him. My college started offline and i actually went out and met people. I did eventually learnt a lot about relationship, thanks to my roommates. So after one year, out of loneliness and false confidence in my ability to cope up , i unblocked him, and messaged him. To my surprise he did replied. He was ofcourse angry, but we sorted it out. We again started talking. Now, i wasn't really bothered when he didn't msg me back in a few hrs. But I still had feelings for him. To fool myself to not fall in that trap again, I told him that I want to be his good friend to which he agreed. This play continued for sometime, but he would sometimes flirt with me and confuse me beyond words. That continued for 2 months, until it all started again. He started to reply me back after 2 days. I finally msged him to never msg me ever again. And this time I didn't block him. 

Months went by, I saw and met multiple guys. Never had anything serious with anyone. Never crossed any boundaries and kept my sanity. I starred feeling more in control and learnt about my attachment style. I found out that the way I behaved with this bumble guy, I behave quite similarly in all of my relationship, including my friends and family. So I'd say I finally decided to have a serious inner work done. 
Amidst this, one day I randomly called him. He picked it up. He jokingly said, that I called him by mistake. To which we laughed. We talked a few times and finally decided to meet for the first time ever. Yeas, he cancelled the plans three times. He said sorry and asked me to give him one last chance. And so we met
First impression? Similar to the online one. Additionally I found him really confident and assertive. We went to have some coffee and chatted for 3 hrs straight. We then started talking more , and frequently met. He became so attentive and caring, but this time, it was consistent. To the contrary of what I had in my mind, this guy was a simple guy, a family guy, a really good son, and a really good friend to his friends. He had a packed schedule but never forgot to message me. He introduced me to his friends and cousins. We went on a few trips. He never crossed any of my boundaries. He clearly told me that he believes in physical boundaries but he does find me attractive. Since that day we met, to today, which is two year now, there wasn't a single day we didn't talk. We are now a happy couple. He has apologized multiple times for his behaviour during the online stage, and I have done the same . We are now in a more mature and comfortable stage. We have met our families, our families are friends with each other and I'm so greatful for how things have turned out. 
He and I are working on our attachment styles, my being anxious and his being avoidant. Everyday we love each more and more now. And we know we want to grow old together.



That being said, i sometimes ( the lil insecure girl in me ) thinks that I was so obsessed with this guy, who is now mine. But he wasn't obsessed with me. I wasn't his first choice. What about those 2 years of pain that I suffered, for which I'd blame both me and him, but myself more. It's unfair. I feel I love him more",0,1732811332.0,family,3,0.5,False

(I can actually see the difference in percolation rate etc.) Be sure to do it every couple hundred brews.,"(Use a Moccamaster approved descaling product. Not vinegar or something like that)

I had descaled my machine once before after my approximate 100th brew. But then it went another couple hundred, probably more without doing it. 

The last couple days I noticed my coffee was a little dull and I switched to a different being and it was also though. I realized it was past time to descale. 

Soni descaled it using the powder and then I ran three cycles of water to flush it through as directed on the website. 

After the descaling I immediately noticed that the flow rate the percolation rate was back to what it had been originally. Subtle difference that I didn't notice until I ran it back to back. 

The water temperature will also now be back to $195° Fahrenheit when it hits the water. I didn't actually test it but I'm sure that it had dipped down closer to 190 degrees as a result of all the buildup. 

And most importantly when I brewed the same beans again that I had tried to brew this morning using the same grind size etc, the coffee was much better. Very noticeable, tangible difference in the resulting coffee. 

The change is gradual as the build-up occurs so one doesn't notice the change but after the descale the percolation rate was noticeably back to normal. I was like, ""oh yeah that is better."" 

I didn't bother to test the temperature of the water before descaling but I have no doubt that it was lower. I definitely recommend descaling every couple hundred brews at most.

Even if you don't notice a difference in your coffee now, you probably will after you descale it.",1,1732811125.0,Moccamaster,2,1.0,False

I bought a Breville Bambino Plus last Black Friday.  Earlier this year I also bought a Baratza Encore ESP Coffee Grinder.

I feel like there are so many variables that I can't seem to dial in my shot.  I've included a video of a double shot I just made yesterday (and the same result today). I used 16.5g of espresso beans, and also included a picture of the grinder setting in the comments.

My steps:

1. Measure out the beans on a scale to 16.5g
2. Grind the beans in the grinder
3. Confirm on scale that it is still 16.5g
4. Flip grounds into espresso basket, and pack down with the push-down accessory (no idea what it's called)
5. Attach to Breville and brew.

Feel free to ask me any follow-up questions.  I'm not sure what I am missing.

Edit:

Some more context - the coffee has no Crema and is very acidic.  It's very thin, but maybe thats because of the lack of Crema.  And lastly, and maybe this is a misunderstanding on my end, but It sometimes only comes out of one side of the basket, or switches from one to the other (like in the video), rather than coming out from both consistently like in other videos I've seen on this subreddit.

If you've ever wanted to feel like you're being rained on indoors but in a fancy way, then having a rain shower is great. I first tried one in an AirBnB I stayed at, and decided I had to get one for myself. So, I came across this option from Veken - here's my thoughts on it.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on the Veken shower head combo here:**

[**https://amzn.to/4fSRwWb**](https://amzn.to/4fSRwWb)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

The Veken shower head combo kinda looks like what would happen if a ufo and a watering can had a baby – and I mean that in the best possible way. At 11.8 inches wide, this thing is basically a dinner plate that spits water.

So, you get the main rainfall head, which simulates standing in a warm rain shower (minus the existential dread of actual rain), plus a handheld sprayer that looks like it could double as a microphone for my shower concerts. The chrome finish is so shiny you can check your hair while installing it, which I definitely didn't do multiple times during setup.

# My Favorite Features

**The rain feature.** That massive 11.8-inch rainfall head is basically like having a personal cloud. . The coverage is so wide that for the first time in my life, I don't have to do that weird shower dance trying to get water on all parts of my body. It's like standing under a warm waterfall, really nice.

**The hand sprayer.** There's 5 different spray settings, so it's kinda like a TV remote for the shower. It's got gentle mist, pressure, and some kind of friendly garden hose setting. All pretty useful in the right context.

**Adjustable arm.** The extension arm is like having a really accommodating friend who's always willing to bend over backward for you – literally. It swivels, tilts, and adjusts so much that I'm pretty sure it's more flexible than I am after a yoga class.

**Anti-clog tech.** The Veken has anti-clog nozzles that basically keep your water flowing straight. You can actually clean them by rubbing the silicone tips, which is oddly satisfying in a way I'm not entirely comfortable discussing.

**Flow control system.** There's a little lever that lets you control the water flow, which is perfect for those ""just need to shave my legs"" moments or when you're trying to save water while doing your shower karaoke warm-ups. 

# Pros

**Easy to install.** I once assembled an IKEA bookshelf that ended up looking like abstract art, but even I managed to install this shower head without calling my handy neighbor. It comes with everything you need, including extra washers (because they know we're going to lose at least one under the sink) and enough Teflon tape to mummify a small appliance.

**Good water pressure.** The pressure is strong enough to make you feel clean but not so intense that you feel like you're being power-washed like a deck.

**Decent build quality.** The joints are solid brass, not plastic pretending to be metal, which means it should last longer than most.

# Cons

* The rainfall head is wide enough that if you have a tiny shower stall, you might feel like you're installing an airplane wing in there. 

* The multiple spray settings are great, but switching between them sometimes requires the grip strength of a rock climber. 

* Once you experience the rainfall setting, you'll never want to use a regular shower head again, which makes traveling a disappointment.

# Final Thoughts

**Who should buy this? Anyone who:**

* Values a good shower more than their morning coffee
* Has ever envied hotel bathroom setups
* Wants to upgrade their bathroom without spending too much
* Enjoys feeling fancy while doing ordinary things

**Who should skip it? If you:**

* Are perfectly content with a sad-drizzle shower head
