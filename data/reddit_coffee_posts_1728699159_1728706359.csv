1g1s3nz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g1s3nz,1st Time Doing the Crystal Creations Aspiration...,"I started a new save file on the Sims specifically for the Grim Reaper challenge, and I've been slowly populating Newcrest with only occult Sims (So far I've got 2 Spellcasters, a mermaid, a vampire, and an alien; alien is also a first for me lol)

I attempted to make one of my Spellcasters look like an elf/fairy (as much as I can without mods, anyway) and gave her the aspiration that came with Crystal Creations, because I haven't properly played with the gem features enough and I knew a lot of the jewelry was especially useful for occult Sims.

I either didn't know or forgot that part of the first tier of that aspiration involves gifting or proposing successfully to someone with a piece of jewelry you crafted üòÖ

Cue my other spellcaster Sim, (her neighbor) coming over on the Welcome Wagon. They hit it off instantly. While they're flirting it up...my fae Sim gets that call about accepting the inheritance money with conditions, and I decide to lean into the story.

I accept the greater sum of money that only comes when you get married within seven days, and then started crafting a ring like mad ü§£

I made her take the other spellcaster on a successful date and had them become girlfriends first, just so things felt a *little* less like an arranged marriage, but they were flirting so hard in the coffee shop they were making other people uncomfortable lol

Finally popped the question, and got eloped in the kitchen the next day (because I was not ready for another first, I've never actually run a wedding event and I've heard they're funky as heck). 

Saddest part, I'm a dummy and forgot to pack all of my other spellcasters paintings of her Familiar (all Masterpieces!) AND her College Photo from getting her degree before I had her move houses, and now they're gone üò≠

Long story short...I guess move your Sims valuables/collectibles into their inventory before you go through with the wedding üòÇ",1,1728706259.0,Sims4,0,1.0,False

1g1s0yb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g1s0yb,What I Ate in Ho Chi Minh City,"Went for a quick 3-day trip to Saigon last week. It was a very spontaneous trip as I booked the flight from MNL to Saigon just two weeks prior. This is my 2nd time in HCM so I just focused on eating some local (and tourist) favorites, and caf√©-hopping.

Here are the places I went to (caf√©s will be on a separate post as I cannot fit everything in one post lol):

1. Bun Thit Nuong Nguyen Trung Truc- the bun thit nuong (cold vermicelli noodles with cha gio and grilled pork) was my favorite dish on this trip! Would definitely come back for this.

2. Com Tam so 1 Nguyen Trai- the com tam (broken rice with porkchop, shredded pork, and egg meatloaf) here was so filling and hearty.  

3. Pho Viet Nam- The regular pho was very good already but I highly recommend getting the raw beef pho in hot stone bowl. The broth was excellent yet for me, their handmade & handcut noodles were the star of the show!

4. Quan Oc Vu- HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend ordering the grilled fish and the snails cooked with water spinach (I had the staff recommend me a snail dish so I don't know what species of snail/mollusk I had). The rice was okay. Skip the cheesy baked scallops. 

5. Banh Mi Huynh Hoa- the most overloaded banh mi ever! I have tried roadside banh mis years ago and they were alright. This one though was so packed! They were very generous with the pate and ham, though I would have preferred less lard. 

6. Ho Thi Ky Food Street- this is where you can find lots of streetfood carts all in one place. IMHO there isn't much variety as it's mostly seafood and grilled skewers. The bo la lot (grilled beef wrapped in betel leaf) was a highlight but overall I wouldn't go back. 

7. Pizza 4P's- one of the most recommended places to eat in Saigon is an Italian restaurant, and for good reason! Their crab pasta is quite rich and full of crab flavor! The pizzas were very good and I loved the fresh burrata. The carbonara, I found a bit dry. 

8. Pho Hoa Pasteur- great pho at reasonable prices. Although I prefer the pho at Pho Viet Nam, this place is still worth a visit because they are very generous with their different kinds of beef! 

9. Apricot Executive Lounge at Tan Son Nhat Airport- included this here because I had my last meal/breakfast in Saigon at this place. The lounge was very nice and spacious though the food was nothing to write home about. 

Places I wanted to go to but couldn't because of lack of time: Bep Me In, Banh Xeo 46A

Overall, Saigon is a special city for me just for the food and caf√©s alone. Vietnamese food is my 2nd favorite cuisine in the ASEAN region (after Thai). I will definitely come back again to try even more food and coffee!

1g1s0wm,https://i.redd.it/6pgplqye29ud1.jpeg,Hair does grow back!,"Hi all,

One more fun update:

This one, I started out really hoping it would work. I read the studies, believe in my potential, and kept at it.

Last month I saw a bunch of baby hairs, and then just tried to stay calm/carry on

Tonight - I took a proper photo after another exosome treatment in my scalp and - I‚Äôm loving all this new hair growth! Lengths are ranging now between1/2‚Äù on still more new guys, some are more like 2‚Äù.

9 months from the before to right now.

I have done 3 hairna exosome scalp treatments, three or four ‚Äúpartial vials‚Äù of the Filcore P198 exosomes (one vial, reconstituted with 3mL saline). Most of the treatments with 1ml each time, using the rest in my face/neck. Tonight I did the whole amount in my scalp. It was totally receptive to it - feels comfortable.

I‚Äôm also taking the Fo-ti herbal supplement (started that around‚Ä¶ June? July?)

I try to remember my collagen with my coffee. Averaging 3x per week that I have that. Give or take. There were a few weeks I just didn‚Äôt have coffee.

Anyhow - I‚Äôm stoked!!

New hair growth is possible! I believe exosomes are absolutely to credit in this. 

Also - previous treatments were with the 5-pin crystal tip. I realized I‚Äôm fresh out of those so I did all single-needle, 1.5mm 34g. Direct plunge (not angling it), dispense whatever feels comfortable, row by row, about every ‚Ä¶ inch? Half-inch? This was actually way more physically comfortable for me than the 5-pin. Waaaaay less blood spots too, which is nice. I think I‚Äôm going to plan for single-needle scalp treatments from here on out.

Ok - time to eat dinner but - love you guys! Happy Friday!

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fvtkmt/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_and_his_mother/)**: October 4, 2024**

I (35F) got married to my husband (M41) recently.

Neither of us like the spotlight so agreed on a small event. The only thing I was firm about was I didn‚Äôt want photos.

My self esteem is in the toilet. In the last 18months I have put on weight. I am not looking to make excuses but there are some reasons why.

1. In the last 18moths I have lost both parents and my grandmother. I have lost 2 jobs and had a miscarriage. Depression has hit me hard at times and I have been comfort eating.
2. I was put on a new medication and weight gain is a side effect.
3. About a year ago I broke my left ankle badly. I have had 3 surgeries to date (the last one was 10days before the wedding). I can‚Äôt walk without pain

I really didn‚Äôt want photos that would remind me of the fact I am now fat.

Few weeks before the wedding my mother in law is talking about going to a local beauty spot for photos. I say no thank you and that yes I am being serious. My husband hears this and later that night I say again I really don‚Äôt want photos and he says that is fine with him.

Week before the wedding I am having the same conversation with MIL and my husband.

Day of the wedding my FIL and MIL pick us up. I am no longer able to drive as I can‚Äôt move my ankle.

We get the whole legal shindig done and as we are going back to the car MIL again says let‚Äôs go to the beauty spot for photos. I again so no but she tells FIL to drive there and my husband just sits there.I know I gave him ‚Äúthe look‚Äù but total silence.

Long story short the photos are taken and we head back.

In the car driving home my MIL starts showing me the photos and I hate myself in them. I look like a pile of fat shit. I look ridiculous in a dress with a medical boot and I can‚Äôt stop the tears rolling down my cheeks.

This upsets my mother in law and there is an atmosphere the whole rest of the day. I really tried to move on, but I had to get out of that stupid dress and all I really just wanted to hide away.

Privately I told my husband him and his mother ruined our wedding day for me because all I can think of is those pictures. He said he didn‚Äôt realise I was so serious about no photos, that it‚Äôs only for his mum to keep and that he thinks I look beautiful.

I told him that not 30mins into our marriage he totally let me down and I don‚Äôt know if I am beyond hurt or furious.

He said I was being ridiculous and that I let him down by making such a fuss over a ‚Äúnormal part of weddings‚Äù. He also said I had hurt his mother (she has some mental health issues and has been obsessing over me crying on my wedding day) and that I need to reassure her she hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong.

I told him no and there will be serious problems if he tries telling her otherwise because as far as I am concerned they both totally ignored my one request and that was unacceptable.

He thinks I am being a totally unreasonable AH.

So am I being an AH reddit?

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

*What if he wanted photos:* 

>He told me multiple times he was fine with no photos during our conversations about it before the wedding.  
I have to take what he says at face value.  
And I did suck it up and let them take the photos. I tried to not cry in the car after. I tried to carry on with the day. I tried to make everybody happy despite the fact I am not.

Commenter: INFO Did you really want to get married? It sounds a bit like you hated the whole thing and forced yourself. Why?

>**OOP:** We both agreed we want a marriage not a wedding.  
We wanted a nice day but not all the fanfare and expectations.

*Mini Update from OOP in Comments:*

I was ready to be told I was an unreasonable AH about photos.

But to be told I shouldn‚Äôt have got married by so many people has crushed me.

We have been together for 9 years and were planning this wedding well before my life went to shit. We have been through so much and I love him and his family dearly. This is the first time anything like this has happened.

We both wanted to get married and it was always going to be a small courthouse event we both agreed that weddings were silly events and we didn‚Äôt want a big fuss. We talked. We talked about everything and as far as knew agreed on everything.

He never once before, during or after said he wanted photos. He has done nothing but tell me he doesn‚Äôt really care about having them.

If everyone saying ‚Äúwhat about his day‚Äù is right‚Ä¶How was I supposed to know if he never said? All the information I had told me he was happy.

I thought we could have a good day and find some happiness in what has been a lot of darkness‚Ä¶.I just had one ask for the day.

Are we not allowed to try and make happiness because I am broken?

I wanted to make everybody happy and I tried despite how I felt. After the legal stuff and the photos I spent the rest of the day hosting the family, getting teas/coffees, making diner for everyone trying to make the day nice.

I wanted a happy day I just didn‚Äôt want to be in the spot light‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt think I HAD to be in order to be married.

*OOP explains some of her grief:* 

>Thank you.  
My parents were difficult, they both had issues that ultimately lead to their deaths and it feels like that has super charged the grief? I don‚Äôt know.  
I have now lost every single person biologically connected to me now and it is a lot of emotions.  
I eat too much.  
Yes it‚Äôs comfort eating but also before I broke my ankle I was a marathon runner. I would easily clock over 70km a week. I am used to fuelling my body not restricting it. I never had to think before.  
Add in quality of food dropping from home cooked to more takeout/convenience and medication causing weight gain and I am not sure I stood a chance.

**Top Comments on Post:** 

**\_s1m0n\_s3z:** Why did you get out of the car at the beauty spot? I'd have sat there until everyone gave up. NTA. Bulldozer MiL deserves all the bad feels she's feeling. She done fucked up, putting her selfish wants ahead of the bride's.

**Apprehensive\_War9612:** Why did you get married right now? What was pressing? You don‚Äôt seem enthused to be getting married. It sounds like you‚Äôre dealing with depression on top of your physical health concerns. So why get married in a dress you do not like, in a surgical boot, 10 days after surgery?

That‚Äôs the reason you didn‚Äôt want pics. Because you didn‚Äôt want to get married. ESH

***OOP is voted NTA, but comments are very very heavily mixed***

**Update (Same Post): October 5, 2024 (Next Day)**

UPDATE -

With all the comments saying I disregarded my husband‚Äôs wishes on his wedding day I asked him directly ‚Äúdid you want those photos and just said you didn‚Äôt \[to\] appease me?‚Äù

Before you all pile on (again) there is no reason he would not answer truthfully.

He replied that he did not care about the photos MIL took in the woods. He said having seen them they are objectively bad (he clarified poorly taken on a shitty phone) not something he would want to keep and not worth the distress caused.

He said the only photo he would want was one of the look on my face staring up at him when we said the ‚ÄúI dos‚Äù. He joked that he should have strapped a go-pro to his forehead to capture that but he doesn‚Äôt NEED a photo to remember it.

I would not have been against that idea because it would have been private between just us.

He cannot give a reason for being silent in the car. MIL has a server mental disorder and I believe there is fear around setting her off on a spiral.

I explained how ambushed I felt and that I only got out of the car to try and keep the peace. That really upset him. He apologised for not speaking up. I think he understands the main issues were not being supported and feeling helpless.

Everybody saying I should have not got out - I am sure you would call me the AH for throwing a childish tantrum refusing to leave the car if I post that scenario. I was in a lose lose situation.

I apologised for letting my insecurities become part of our marriage. He hadn‚Äôt realised just how deep my issues run. I am guilty of putting on a brave face so I can‚Äôt blame him for that.

We don‚Äôt want any drama. I am not going to hold a grudge against MIL. This is the first time there has ever been an issue like this in our family. Husband will talk to her but not about my insecurities. He suggested asking her to delete the photos but I said we both know he would have to die on that hill. We are going to move past the whole thing. However, I don‚Äôt know what to do if she makes them public.

We both agree that what matters is our 9 year long relationship that is now a marriage and not a single day where some papers were signed. I am sure that comment is going to upset a lot of people who feel a wedding day should be a magical life changing event but it is how WE view OUR lives together, nothing to do with your feelings.

I wouldn‚Äôt put our relationship/marriage on hold because times are tough so why would I put this one day off?

We are not American and marriage is not such a big deal here. Many couples never marry and that is very normal. Since before everything happened our main reason for getting married was so I could legally use his protected surname.

This is why we just went to the registry office and it was 8 people in attendance.

I apologise for my fatphobic language. Growing up in the 90‚Äôs with a mother with an ED has clearly had an effect on how I view bodies and I need to work on that.

I have had counselling for feelings around my loss of mobility which has naturally touched on the other issues in my life but I am going to speak to my doctor about more specialised grief counselling going forward.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

 *One more thought from OOP as to why she wanted to be married:* 

>I have given an update but as a more complete answer to you.  
I wanted to be a family with him.  
I could only legally use his protected surname if I married him or got everybody in the country with that surname to agree to me using taking name.  
I have had my entire biological family taken from me, I want society, the law, history I don‚Äôt know to recognise my family which is my husband and I (and the dogs)  
I have lost my mobility and my freedom with it. Not being able to walk or drive let alone run which was my hobby. I have to rely on others so much now when I was the one people relied on before.  
Why should I also give up the day I planned on being married (my grandmother‚Äôs birthday).

Commenter: Why is his surname ""protected"", what does that mean?

>**OOP:** That it is rare so realistically you need to marry into the name to be able to use it

Commenter: This is hard for me to decide. Because you have a right to say no to the pictures but pictures aren't really for you. My brother didn't like pictures taken off him very often. Now he's dead. I would love to have more pictures. I get so excited when I can find one with him in the background. Same with one of my grandmas. Pictures aren't so much for us but others. I've learned if someone wants a picture of me, I almost always say yes now.

>**OOP:** I can see your point.  
But these are poor quality photos that were not just for my mother in law because she waved them right in front of my face in the car momenta after they were taken.  
After I had said no 3 times.  
Which caused me to start crying. People seem to assume I threw some sort of fit but I just sat there desperately trying to stop the tears in my eyes. I didn‚Äôt do anything else. I couldn‚Äôt do anything else at that point.

**Editor's Note:** a TON of OOP's comments were responding to people telling her that she should have asked her husband/maybe her husband was lying/she disregarded his wishes/etc. I didn't include all of them because frankly it got repetitive and frustrating, so I included only the first couple. But I wanted to highlight this fact because in her update she mentioned ""all of the comments"" saying she disregarded his wishes.",9,1728705611.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,4,0.91,False

My teammate became a manager 6 months ago (he is 5 years senior/experienced that me), and I started reporting to him. I‚Äôve worked with him for the past 5 years. Since he became a manager, we‚Äôve had weekly 101 calls where I provide updates. At times, things were a bit tense because we had different points of view. I received feedback from upper management that I need to demonstrate I can collaborate effectively with others since I‚Äôm being considered for the next level of VP as a pod lead. I immediately adjusted my approach, treating him more as a manager rather than a long-term colleague. But honestly, it felt awkward to have calls with him, whether on Zoom or in a meeting room. We‚Äôve had disagreements before, but we always found ways to work through them.

Recently, he canceled our last two meetings, which gave me time to reflect. I decided to make the next meeting more casual, like having a chat over tea or coffee in the cafeteria. The next meeting was scheduled over Zoom on a work-from-home day, but I suggested we meet in the office instead, and he agreed. We had a good conversation after a long time, discussing how certain team members could improve , who is doing well, and who might need to rebrand themselves.

Then, something unexpected happened that I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. He mentioned that his manager wants him to refocus on IC work and asked if I needed any help with my team. I wasn‚Äôt ready for this question. When he asked, ‚ÄúHow you see me?‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI see you as a counsil. When I have doubts, I talk to you to brainstorm and clear my thoughts.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt say much in response. I am not happy with my answer, i dont know why I am not happy. I dont know how to handle this, i dont have such experience. Over time relationship are more important for me. He said that I might move from his reporting and directly report to his manager.

Now, my manager‚Äôs manager is visiting my location in two weeks, and I‚Äôm worried they might ask me the same question. I want to be prepared with a solid answer. A respected and responsible answer. How should I handle situations like this? I dont have this experience. Plz give me some guidance.",1,1728705487.0,managers,0,1.0,False

We meet up and have dinner, and the conversation somehow lands back on serial killers and horror films. We go into detail about some of our most memorable cases we've followed, dinner finishes up, and I pay the bill and ask if she's still up for a walk. She says yes. Mind you, it's gotten dark by this point. 

We both drove our own cars, so I told her to follow me as I jumped into my car. I punched in the name of the lake in my gp, and away we went. The drive was only about 10 minutes, but I didn't really seem to remember ever going this way. The roads got darker, streetlights became sparse, and I had to take multiple turns. I was really starting to doubt this route, and as I looked in the rearview, I saw she was following from further behind. At this point, I figured it was best for me to call her and tell her I think Google maps was jerking me around, so I pulled over on the side of the road, looked more closely at maps, and decided to call her, as she was stopped about a half block behind me. As the phone rang, I saw her flip the car around and speed off on the opposite direction. She never answered, and after letting the whole thing sink in, I drove home, opened my dating app to see she also blocked me. 

Then it dawned on me that I am an absolute idiot, and that talking about my favorite serial killers with a woman who is easily spooked, then leading her to the middle of nowhere was probably just about the worst first date idea ever. I'm bummed, and I feel awful for scaring the shit out of her, but I guess I just have to laugh it off at this point, I don't think I'll be hearing from her again. 

Next time I'll just go to a damned coffee shop like a NOT serial killer


TL;DR

Didn't think a first date idea through very well; convinced a really rad chick that I was probably a murderer",2,1728705399.0,tifu,1,0.75,False

I want to talk to you about something important, something we often avoid thinking about. It's a bit heavy, but stick with me - I promise there's a silver lining.

Here's the thing: everyone you know, everyone you love, they're all going to die someday. I know, I know, it's not exactly a cheery thought. But hear me out. We spend so much time pretending this isn't true, avoiding the topic, pushing it to the back of our minds. But what if, instead of running from this reality, we used it to make our lives richer?

Life moves fast, doesn't it? One minute you're hanging out with your best friend in high school, the next you're struggling to find time for a quick coffee catch-up between work and family commitments. Those good times, those moments of joy and connection - they're precious, and they're fleeting. It's hard to make them last, to hold onto them as life rushes by.

But here's where we can make a difference. Instead of saving up all our love and appreciation for some imagined future goodbye, why not express it now? Tell the people in your life how much they mean to you. Don't wait for a special occasion or a dramatic moment. Do it today, do it often.

I'm not saying you need to go around making grand declarations (though if that's your style, go for it!). It can be as simple as a text to let someone know you're thinking of them, or taking the time to really listen when they're talking. Share a memory that makes you smile, or thank them for something specific they've done that's impacted your life.

By acknowledging the temporary nature of our time together, we can actually deepen our connections. We can prioritize what truly matters - the relationships and experiences that bring meaning to our lives. So let's make an effort to create those lasting memories, to have those important conversations, to show our love in both words and actions.

Life is short, and it's unpredictable. But it's also beautiful, filled with opportunities for connection and joy. Don't wait to say goodbye. Instead, embrace each day as a chance to say ""I love you,"" ""I appreciate you,"" ""You matter to me."" Because in the end, it's these moments of genuine connection that make life worth living.

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right forum for this question, but I‚Äôll ask anyway.

My teammate became a manager 6 months ago (he is 5 years senior/experienced that me), and I started reporting to him. I‚Äôve worked with him for the past 5 years. Since he became a manager, we‚Äôve had weekly 101 calls where I provide updates. At times, things were a bit tense because we had different points of view. I received feedback from upper management that I need to demonstrate I can collaborate effectively with others since I‚Äôm being considered for the next level of VP as a pod lead. I immediately adjusted my approach, treating him more as a manager rather than a long-term colleague. But honestly, it felt awkward to have calls with him, whether on Zoom or in a meeting room. We‚Äôve had disagreements before, but we always found ways to work through them.

Recently, he canceled our last two meetings, which gave me time to reflect. I decided to make the next meeting more casual, like having a chat over tea or coffee in the cafeteria. The next meeting was scheduled over Zoom on a work-from-home day, but I suggested we meet in the office instead, and he agreed. We had a good conversation after a long time, discussing how certain team members could improve , who is doing well, and who might need to rebrand themselves.

Then, something unexpected happened that I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. He mentioned that his manager wants him to refocus on IC work and asked if I needed any help with my team. I wasn‚Äôt ready for this question. When he asked, ‚ÄúHow you see me?‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI see you as a counsil. When I have doubts, I talk to you to brainstorm and clear my thoughts.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt say much in response. I am not happy with my answer, i dont know why I am not happy. I dont know how to handle this, i dont have such experience. Over time relationship are more important for me. He said that I might move from his reporting and directly report to his manager.

Now, my manager‚Äôs manager is visiting my location in two weeks, and I‚Äôm worried they might ask me the same question. I want to be prepared with a solid answer. A respected and responsible answer. How should I handle situations like this? I dont have this experience. Plz give me some guidance.",2,1728704495.0,UXDesign,0,0.75,False

1g1rc10,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/1g1rc10/the_immortal_office_plant_and_lorraine_the/,The Immortal Office Plant and Lorraine the Tattletale ,"Back in 2010, I was working in IT at a large company. On my first day they set me up in a cubicle. In my cubicle there was a house plant from, apparently, whoever sat there before me. I don't know what kind of plant it was but it was basically a series of creeping vines with leaves on them. It was growing out of its plastic pot and spilling onto the desk.

I completely neglected this plant. I always forgot to water it, never positioned it near sunlight, and I would occasionally dump my leftover coffee into the pot, just to see what would happen. At first, didn't really care whether it lived or died, but after a few weeks I began to respect its resilience.

No matter what I did this plant thrived like a Burmese python in Florida. It had the constitution of a verdant Rasputin and the genetics of a photosynthetic Bo Jackson. The vines kept growing longer and longer until it spanned the entire length of my desk.

One day, our application was down and I had nothing to do. I decided it would look cool if the plant hung over the entrance to my cube. I constructed a primitive trellis by twisting and bending some pieces of plastic and inserting them into gaps in the cubicle frame. Then, I coiled the vines around the arch and secured the rest on top of my cube with tape. NGL, it looked pretty good.

I got a lot of compliments about my trellis. I think people enjoyed the touch of green in our monotonously gray environment. Because it was up higher it was probably getting more light. My plant grew rapidly. Within a few months it wrapped around the entire perimeter of my cubicle (not that this was a particularly large area). People would stop by just to chitchat about how big the plant was getting and how nice it looked. My coworker even started to water it if I wasn't in.

But, every office has that one person who believes happiness is a zero sum game. The kind of person who would anonymously report you for accidentally parking in a visitor spot. That was Lorraine. Lorraine was an EH&S volunteer (Environment Health & Safety for you non-corporate folk). Lorraine's volunteer job was to conduct ergonomic assessments. These involved making sure your hands rest at a 90 degree angle, you aren't slouching in your chair, and your monitor is X inches from your face. She would even dock you points if your desk drawers weren't properly labeled. She even required you to have a label that said ""Empty"" if you didn't use that drawer.

I suspect Lorraine's family was murdered by an evil plant when she was a child because otherwise her hatred of my setup would have been unwarranted. Even though she sat on the other side of the building she would find reasons to walk by my cubicle so she could make passive aggressive noises and mutter comments like ""unprofessional"" to herself. I would simply ignore her. 

One night, Lorraine journeyed to the forgotten corner of the storage wing and pryed open a rusted filing cabinet that had not been touched by human hands since the days when ""email"" was a hyphenated word. Inside, she blew the dust off a thick grimoire titled ""Employee Handbook - 2003"". By the dim glow of an old CRT monitor, she pored over the pages until she found a passage in section 7.9, Office Safety.
The archaeic rule stated (and this is a direct quote) ""Lest it be known to all ye dwellers of thy cubicles that EH&S shall smiteth the man who will display or placeteth an object atop the sacred walls of his cubicle, for this act is a violation of safety and an abomination."" 
A devilish smile formed on Lorraine's pudgy face. 

The next day, I heard a knock on the flimsy metal frame of my cubicle. It was the well-dressed silver haired director of EH&S. He paused when I greeted him, as though he was trying to find the right words and he smiled sympathetically.
""I'm sorry to I have to tell you this, but unfortunately you'll need to take that down."" He said, gesturing at my trellis.
""Why's that?"" I asked.
""Technically, you're not allowed to have anything on top of your cubicle. Someone could potentially get injured if an object fell on their head.""
I made a show of studying my trellis with a perplexed expression on my face, as though I was considering how much damage this plant could inflict on a human head.
He sighed. ""You can still have your plant. You just need to keep it on your desk.""
""Ok"" was all I could say.
As I watched him leave I caught a glimpse of Lorraine peeking out from the other end of the hall. That tattletale bitch!
I reluctantly dismantled my architecture and returned the plant to my desk.

For the rest of the week, every single person who came by my desk asked me why I had taken everything down. I told them I was forced to against my will. I hinted that an EH&S volunteer may have reported that I was violating some obscure rule. They all knew who was to blame. I can only hope my fellow employees enacted vengeance in subtle ways, like ""forgetting"" to ask her to sign someone's greeting card or ""accidentally"" throwing out her leftovers.

As for the plant, after experiencing the elation of elevation it could never quite readapt to the dim understory inside my cubicle. Many of the leaves turned yellow and I had to periodically brush away dead ones from my desk. I did what could to revive it. I even tried giving it more coffee, but the plant slowly withered like a senior citizen who's life savings are being bled dry by an assisted living facility.

The following year, I transferred to another business unit within the company. As is tradition, I left the plant in the cubicle for the next person when I departed.

This morning I woke up an started the morning as normal though it was a bit different as my kiddo was out of school today, I woke up late. 

About 7:30AM or so. I won‚Äôt lie I lounged in bed and enjoyed snuggles with my pup and her senior pup sister who is currently close to passing from cancer. 
For clarification: 
She isn‚Äôt suffering and still had the gumption to pant an prance to anyone who visits and enthusiastic for food an on good pain meds.

Back to the story.

I come outside after packing my breakfast/ lunch an snacks for my job. Hop in the car not really awake as no coffee, no earl grey tea. 
Raw doggin life. 
Start the car, go to drive off. Something doesn‚Äôt feel right.

I‚Äôve had flats before due to a nail so got out expecting one flat. Nope. 3/4. 
Stabbed in the wall. 

Life really throws you curveballs. Nothing else was touched. It was a targeted thing. There is a police report, I will not disclose further as it could cause both parties to be revealed.

I hope for anyone else going through something crazy, keep a level head. Weigh options. 

I truely doubt anything will come of it. 
Yes there were cameras including neighbors. Unfortunately no one seemed to catch anything.

Be safe. Be mindful. Watch your six.

Next is the coffee. It beats Wawa, hands down. I cannot say much against places like Dunkin, but it's the best convenience store coffee to me to date. 
 
I guess the third thing is the selection of snacks. I noticed that you guys carry the ketchup Herr's. Not one location of anywhere in Jersey sells them. I don't get why these are so damn good, but it hits hard.

I recently was found to have moderate fatty liver and immediately cut sugar, junk food, simple grains and potatoes. 
Since then I have dramatically increased my vegetable intake, I now have multiple serves in almost every meal of the day. I only eat complex carbs with high fibre content and low or no sugar. Protiens are lean meat, eggs and seafood. I have a few serves of dairy a day, I am breastfeeding so I still need grains and dairy to keep up with the nutritional demand on my body. I have a couple of serves of fruit a day. I take a breastfeeding vitamin. 
I only drink lemon water in the morning, water through the day, green tea, coconut water occasionally and an espresso coffee occasionally (no sweeteners)

No medications. 

My plan for exercise is 30mins of incline treadmill brisk walking 5x a week with some weight/resistance training 2x a week. I would also like to do yoga for mental well-being and flexibility. 

I quit smoking 10 months ago now and I'm never taking it back up again. I also don't drink anymore at all and will never look at alcohol the same again. 

I can't do much about sleep at this point as I'm breastfeeding a 6 month old and I'm up through the night. It will be a while until I can get better sleep.  

I'm very serious about changing my lifestyle, I struggle with depression (starting therapy at the end of this month ) which is why I was mostly sedentary for quite a few years, now have low muscle tone. I want to get healthy, have energy for my kids and at least live long enough to see them grow up, hopefully longer. 

Will it be a few years until I see and feel a difference with these changes to my diet and lifestyle ? Will I still see the benifits even if I can't improve the sleep at this time ? I plan to breastfeed until at least 1 year mark or longer.

The friendly, unassuming old woman is not someone he would have pinned as a person of interest in a mysterious death. 

She lives in a gorgeous, two-story adobe house in the rural southern California town of San Julian with her sixth husband, Mr. Joseph Ross. She welcomes Cabrera and his partner, Detective Elise Alvaro, with a smile. Her sparkling, dark brown eyes exude a warm familiarity. Ôªø

Cabrera takes mental note of the house‚Äôs cozy atmosphere and immaculate cleanliness. He feels foolish being there. Inside are the hallmarks of a typical, law-abiding, affluent married couple. 

Monet imitations and family portraits decorate the walls atop antique furniture with embroidered, floral patterns. There are bookshelves stocked with a wide breadth of genres, albeit with a heavy emphasis on romance.

A glass corner hutch stores what appears to be a small community of porcelain statuettes, with Christmas village snow globes, antique renderings of cats and dogs, cherubs, and Grecian nymphs. The only break from the pristine order of the dining room can be seen on the coffee table, with sewing items strewn about in front of the bulky television. 

He can only assume that it is permanently stationed on some sort of home-shopping channel. Another cabinet displays fine china dinnerware of countryside landscapes, cementing the central theme of the room.

The whole place smells like cinnamon buns fresh out of the oven, which Darling has been baking up until their arrival. She insists that they sit in the dining room, where they can chit chat and enjoy the breathtaking view of the rolling green hills. 

Darling makes a point of telling the detectives that this is how she starts every morning, with a nice cup of chai green. She ushers them to the dining room and gestures for them to take a seat at the table.

‚ÄúWhat about your husband? Is he home?‚Äù asks Cabrera.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs resting in the bedroom upstairs. He spent a week in the hospital for a minor heart attack.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I hope he recovers soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, thank you. Do you prefer‚Äî‚Äù Darling starts to ask, but she is interrupted by the loud shrill of the white corded phone on the wall. ‚Äú‚Äîcoffee or tea?‚Äù

Cabrera eyes the screeching phone. It demands to be picked up. He can‚Äôt recall the last time he‚Äôs seen or heard such an ancient piece of technology.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to get that?‚Äù

Darling floats over to the wall and brings the phone to her ear in one smooth motion.

‚ÄúRoss residence.‚Äù

Her tone is light and sweet, remaining calm amidst the muffled barrage of unrestrained screaming on the other end of the line.

‚ÄúSorry again, dear, he can‚Äôt come to the phone right now, but I‚Äôll let him know you called.‚Äù

She hangs up the phone and gazes up at the detectives with a tight-lipped smile and unblinking eyes.

‚ÄúCoffee or tea?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt take up too much of your time, Mrs. Ross,‚Äù says Alvaro, ‚Äúwe just need to ask a few questions and then we‚Äôll be on our way.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease stick around as long as you wish. We rarely have visitors.‚Äù

‚ÄúRarely? Don‚Äôt you have any children?‚Äù

‚ÄúA long time ago I had two daughters, but they died young.‚Äù

Alvaro‚Äôs expression softens. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about your son?‚Äù Cabrera recalls seeing a young man in some of the family portraits in the living room.

‚ÄúJoe‚Äôs son, Dan, lives in Seattle with his wife and two young sons.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt come to visit at all?‚Äù

Darling‚Äôs right eye twitches and her smile tightens.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre busy people; lawyers, you know. So, coffee or tea?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe appreciate the offer--‚Äù starts Alvaro.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have coffee,‚Äù Cabrera pipes up, ignoring his partner‚Äôs irritated side glance.

‚ÄúBlack,‚Äù he adds, before nudging Alvaro. 

Reluctantly, she gives in and replies, ‚ÄúSame.‚Äù

Darling disappears into the kitchen, humming to herself.

Again, Cabrera feels foolish. What he simply can‚Äôt understand is how this little old woman with her yellow, pastel, daisy-print dress and short, curly, salt-and-pepper hair could be connected to so many deaths.

They‚Äôve got nothing to prove it. No physical evidence beyond the mere suspicion that she could be a carrier of some sort of disease. She‚Äôs got six dead husbands. Now her ex-brother-in-law lies dead under uncannily similar circumstances. All seven met the same unexplained, gruesome end. 

They had just received the toxicology report for the most recent death, Robbie Jacobs from San Diego. It stated that Mr. Jacobs‚Äô blood alcohol level was .15%, but they found no other incriminating substances, like rodenticide or cyanide.

The coroner noted that there were no exterior wounds, and no signs of a fight. And yet, from head to toe his skin was blue and purple. What the report couldn‚Äôt explain were the maggots in his scrotum. Nor could it explain the distended belly, or the thousands of beetles and cockroaches that swarmed out of the body the very second that the coroner punctured the skin with a scalpel.

He shivers at the memory. Bugs were everywhere inside the bloated corpse. And the smell. That stench stuck with him for days.

‚ÄúHere you go, dearies!‚Äù

Darling returns with three mugs and two cinnamon buns on a tray. She serves them their coffee and treats with forks on the side. How could she let their fingers get too sticky from the warm and moist buttercream frosting on top.

She seats herself across the detectives with her mug of chai green in hand. ‚ÄúSo, if I may ask, what is this about? Why have you come?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is about Robert Jacobs,‚Äù answers Cabrera. ‚ÄúDid you know him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do, yes. Robbie was my ex-husband Connie‚Äôs brother. What did he do now? Did something happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúRobert Jacobs is dead,‚Äù Alvaro blurts out.

Darling blows on her steaming hot tea and takes a sip. The corner of her mouth twitches into a grin as she lowers her mug. ‚ÄúOh? So, he‚Äôs keeled over and gone to meet the Lord. When did he pass?‚Äù

*Curious‚Ä¶* Cabrera ponders. *Such an odd time to smile.* Alvaro throws him a suspicious glance.

‚ÄúAbout a week ago. You weren‚Äôt informed about his death?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, this is the first time I‚Äôm hearing about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen was the last time you had any contact with Mr. Jacobs?‚Äù

Darling stares into her chai green, firmly clutching the mug. ‚ÄúLast month Joe and I were vacationing and visiting friends, and we happened to bump into Robbie and his wife, Ethel, at Seaport Village. It was an unpleasant encounter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe called me a ‚Äòbitch‚Äô and threatened to kill me. He said he‚Äôd make me suffer first before he‚Äôd cut me up into pieces.‚Äù

Cabrera raises a brow. ‚ÄúWhy would he say that to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause he thought I was responsible for Connie and his mother‚Äôs death. How did he die?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe cause is unknown.‚Äù

The corner of Darling‚Äôs lips curves upward. A spark dashes in her eyes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you think I killed him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt does look...‚Äù Alvaro starts to say.

Darling frowns. ‚ÄúSuspicious? Is this about my past husbands?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not a suspect for murder. That‚Äôs not what we are saying,‚Äù Cabrera insists. He looks to his side, and registers Alvaro‚Äôs cynical glare. Her eyes betray her thoughts, despite tight lips‚ÄîThat‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre saying.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll remind you that my sixth husband, Joe, is still alive, and that we‚Äôve been happily married for seven years now!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just trying to piece together the cause of Robert Jacobs‚Äô death. His family wants closure.‚Äù

‚ÄúHis death is the best thing that could have happened to Ethel!‚Äù

The two detectives exchange quick, alarmed glances.

‚ÄúWhy would you say that?‚Äù asks Cabrera.

‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt a good man. Not even a half-decent husband,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúHe was a heavy drinker,‚Äù she shakes her head, ‚Äúand he squandered most of his inheritance on gambling and whores.‚Äù

‚ÄúMrs. Ross, Robert Jacobs‚Äô wife told us that he died the same way that your ex-husband, Connor, and his mother, died,‚Äù says Alvaro.

‚ÄúSo, Robbie was sick?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, he showed flu-like symptoms, skin discoloration, and swelling, especially in the abdomen area.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like he died from natural causes; I figure it had to do with his drinking.‚Äù

‚ÄúJacobs was with a mistress‚Äî‚Äô‚Äô

‚ÄúMistress? Why am I not surprised?‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄîAnd they had gone to a hotel in the evening, but they didn‚Äôt check out the next morning as planned. Jacobs‚Äô body was discovered by a hotel housekeeper. His mistress was found hiding in the bathroom. She claims that she saw a woman in the hotel room with them. Her description matched yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, bullshit!‚Äù Darling blurts out. ‚ÄúPardon my language, but I wasn‚Äôt in the city last week.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôve figured that out.‚Äù

Cabrera interjects, ‚ÄúPerhaps she was seeing things, as she had mentioned that you had red eyes. She also mentioned that your reflection in the mirror resembled a kind of demonic creature.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Ethel Jacobs thinks you had something to do with her husband‚Äôs death,‚Äù Alvaro adds.

‚ÄúMe? How could I be responsible for his death? I didn‚Äôt force him to down bottles of cheap wine.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn her mind, she believes it was witchcraft.‚Äù

‚ÄúWitchcraft? Oh, come on! Detectives, be serious!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we did a little background digging,‚Äù Alvaro says, ‚Äúwe found out that your ex-husbands had also suffered those exact symptoms, and that they died in the same manner.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you really do think it‚Äôs witchcraft?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not all. I‚Äôm not a believer in the supernatural. There‚Äôs a scientific explanation behind these deaths.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe coroner who examined Jacobs‚Äô body suspects that it could be an infectious disease that you may have passed onto him and the others.‚Äù

Darling chortles. ‚ÄúOh, please, I do not carry an infectious disease! I had my regular checkup last month and I have a clean bill of health! And I always wash my hands with soap before I cook! I bathe every day and take every precaution to keep myself in good health. I haven‚Äôt had the flu, or even a cold since childhood.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good to hear, but we think it‚Äôs best if you come with us to the medical clinic and get tested.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, dear; I‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúMrs. Ross‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI might know something that could explain it all,‚Äù Darling says in a coy manner. 

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a long story to tell.‚Äù She drinks her tea and dabs the corners of her lips 
with a napkin.

Alvaro presses on. ‚ÄúOkay, tell us what you know.

‚ÄúFirst, have a taste of my cinnamon bun. You haven‚Äôt even touched it!‚Äù

Taken aback, Alvaro narrows her eyes. ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, go on, dear! Just a bite and tell me what you think.‚Äù

‚ÄúMrs. Ross, this is a serious matter we‚Äôre discussing here!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm serious, too. Try my creamy bun.‚Äù

Alvaro scoffs and nudges Cabrera to say something.

Darling raises a brow. ‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôve poisoned it? Infected it? Oh, don‚Äôt be so silly!‚Äù

Without hesitation, she reaches over to Alvaro‚Äôs plate with a fork and stabs into the bun, slicing off a tiny chunk at the corner. Pure bliss consumes her round, jolly face as she chews on it. Her eyes sparkle with glee.

‚ÄúSee? It‚Äôs baked perfectly. Have a bite! It brings me so much joy to see others enjoy my food.‚Äù

Cabrera nods. ‚ÄúOkay, okay, I‚Äôll have a bite.‚Äù

Might as well anyway, he reasons with himself. He woke up late and skipped breakfast, so he had to wait until lunchtime at the police station canteen. Today‚Äôs menu was a disappointment: a miserly tomato and ham sandwich with no cheese, a cup of assorted fruits, and a salad lightly coated with ranch. Now the glistening buttercream spread on the bun calls to him in a sultry voice only he can hear.

*Eat me*.

He picks up the fork and digs in.

Instant addiction. The sweetness! Its delectable creamy texture! The magical bun‚Äôs flavor lassos him in for a second bite. It melts in his mouth, and the buttercream frosting is heavenly. Like a sweet memory, it lingers in his taste buds.

‚ÄúThis is incredible! Wow!‚Äù he exclaims.

Darling beams. ‚ÄúThank you, Detective. There‚Äôs more if you like.‚Äù

He turns to his partner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unbelievably delicious! Take one bite! Come on, just one!‚Äù

Alvaro throws him a hard look, but with some resistance she caves and haphazardly digs in with her fork.

‚ÄúIt is delicious,‚Äù she says without feeling.

Darling tilts her head and smiles at her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope you‚Äîmmm‚Äîdon‚Äôt mind, Mrs. Ross,‚Äù Cabrera says in between bites, ‚Äúif we record the conversation.‚Äù

He pulls out his smartphone from the pocket of his jacket and places it on the table, switching the voice recorder on.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLike I said, it‚Äôs a long story and there might be details you won‚Äôt be able to remember or write down fast enough.‚Äù

The quiet, unassuming grandmother blows into her chai green and takes a long sip, savoring its warmth and essence. She takes a moment to marvel at the rolling hills, and the other large, adobe houses that dot the landscape. After a moment of meditative calmness, she turns to the detectives.

At once, her profound, dark eyes pierce into theirs, widening into a stare that raises the hairs on Cabrera‚Äôs arms. Such a feeling had not struck him in years. The same sense of visceral dread that he felt when he stared into the pitch black of a gun barrel during a botched hostage negotiation. A sinking feeling of foreboding in his stomach that begged him to abandon ship at once.

*This is it. Go back now, or you will never return.*

He shivers, and Darling Ross begins her story.

1g1qyyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1g1qyyw/the_giggling_grandma_with_the_lizard_eyes_part_1/,The Giggling Grandma with the Lizard Eyes - part 1,"Darling Ross, a 59-year-old grandmother and five-time widow, puzzles Detective Jorge Cabrera. The friendly, unassuming old woman is not someone he would have pinned as a person of interest in a mysterious death. 

She lives in a gorgeous, two-story adobe house in the rural southern California town of San Julian with her sixth husband, Mr. Joseph Ross. She welcomes Cabrera and his partner, Detective Elise Alvaro, with a smile. Her sparkling, dark brown eyes exude a warm familiarity. Ôªø

Cabrera takes mental note of the house‚Äôs cozy atmosphere and immaculate cleanliness. He feels foolish being there. Inside are the hallmarks of a typical, law-abiding, affluent married couple. 

Monet imitations and family portraits decorate the walls atop antique furniture with embroidered, floral patterns. There are bookshelves stocked with a wide breadth of genres, albeit with a heavy emphasis on romance.

A glass corner hutch stores what appears to be a small community of porcelain statuettes, with Christmas village snow globes, antique renderings of cats and dogs, cherubs, and Grecian nymphs. The only break from the pristine order of the dining room can be seen on the coffee table, with sewing items strewn about in front of the bulky television. 

He can only assume that it is permanently stationed on some sort of home-shopping channel. Another cabinet displays fine china dinnerware of countryside landscapes, cementing the central theme of the room.

The whole place smells like cinnamon buns fresh out of the oven, which Darling has been baking up until their arrival. She insists that they sit in the dining room, where they can chit chat and enjoy the breathtaking view of the rolling green hills. 

Darling makes a point of telling the detectives that this is how she starts every morning, with a nice cup of chai green. She ushers them to the dining room and gestures for them to take a seat at the table.

‚ÄúWhat about your husband? Is he home?‚Äù asks Cabrera.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs resting in the bedroom upstairs. He spent a week in the hospital for a minor heart attack.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I hope he recovers soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, thank you. Do you prefer‚Äî‚Äù Darling starts to ask, but she is interrupted by the loud shrill of the white corded phone on the wall. ‚Äú‚Äîcoffee or tea?‚Äù

Cabrera eyes the screeching phone. It demands to be picked up. He can‚Äôt recall the last time he‚Äôs seen or heard such an ancient piece of technology.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to get that?‚Äù

Darling floats over to the wall and brings the phone to her ear in one smooth motion.

‚ÄúRoss residence.‚Äù

Her tone is light and sweet, remaining calm amidst the muffled barrage of unrestrained screaming on the other end of the line.

‚ÄúSorry again, dear, he can‚Äôt come to the phone right now, but I‚Äôll let him know you called.‚Äù

She hangs up the phone and gazes up at the detectives with a tight-lipped smile and unblinking eyes.

‚ÄúCoffee or tea?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt take up too much of your time, Mrs. Ross,‚Äù says Alvaro, ‚Äúwe just need to ask a few questions and then we‚Äôll be on our way.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease stick around as long as you wish. We rarely have visitors.‚Äù

‚ÄúRarely? Don‚Äôt you have any children?‚Äù

‚ÄúA long time ago I had two daughters, but they died young.‚Äù

Alvaro‚Äôs expression softens. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about your son?‚Äù Cabrera recalls seeing a young man in some of the family portraits in the living room.

‚ÄúJoe‚Äôs son, Dan, lives in Seattle with his wife and two young sons.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt come to visit at all?‚Äù

Darling‚Äôs right eye twitches and her smile tightens.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre busy people; lawyers, you know. So, coffee or tea?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe appreciate the offer--‚Äù starts Alvaro.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have coffee,‚Äù Cabrera pipes up, ignoring his partner‚Äôs irritated side glance.

‚ÄúBlack,‚Äù he adds, before nudging Alvaro. 

Reluctantly, she gives in and replies, ‚ÄúSame.‚Äù

Darling disappears into the kitchen, humming to herself.

Again, Cabrera feels foolish. What he simply can‚Äôt understand is how this little old woman with her yellow, pastel, daisy-print dress and short, curly, salt-and-pepper hair could be connected to so many deaths.

They‚Äôve got nothing to prove it. No physical evidence beyond the mere suspicion that she could be a carrier of some sort of disease. She‚Äôs got six dead husbands. Now her ex-brother-in-law lies dead under uncannily similar circumstances. All seven met the same unexplained, gruesome end. 

They had just received the toxicology report for the most recent death, Robbie Jacobs from San Diego. It stated that Mr. Jacobs‚Äô blood alcohol level was .15%, but they found no other incriminating substances, like rodenticide or cyanide.

The coroner noted that there were no exterior wounds, and no signs of a fight. And yet, from head to toe his skin was blue and purple. What the report couldn‚Äôt explain were the maggots in his scrotum. Nor could it explain the distended belly, or the thousands of beetles and cockroaches that swarmed out of the body the very second that the coroner punctured the skin with a scalpel.

He shivers at the memory. Bugs were everywhere inside the bloated corpse. And the smell. That stench stuck with him for days.

‚ÄúHere you go, dearies!‚Äù

Darling returns with three mugs and two cinnamon buns on a tray. She serves them their coffee and treats with forks on the side. How could she let their fingers get too sticky from the warm and moist buttercream frosting on top.

She seats herself across the detectives with her mug of chai green in hand. ‚ÄúSo, if I may ask, what is this about? Why have you come?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is about Robert Jacobs,‚Äù answers Cabrera. ‚ÄúDid you know him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do, yes. Robbie was my ex-husband Connie‚Äôs brother. What did he do now? Did something happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúRobert Jacobs is dead,‚Äù Alvaro blurts out.

Darling blows on her steaming hot tea and takes a sip. The corner of her mouth twitches into a grin as she lowers her mug. ‚ÄúOh? So, he‚Äôs keeled over and gone to meet the Lord. When did he pass?‚Äù

*Curious‚Ä¶* Cabrera ponders. *Such an odd time to smile.* Alvaro throws him a suspicious glance.

‚ÄúAbout a week ago. You weren‚Äôt informed about his death?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, this is the first time I‚Äôm hearing about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen was the last time you had any contact with Mr. Jacobs?‚Äù

Darling stares into her chai green, firmly clutching the mug. ‚ÄúLast month Joe and I were vacationing and visiting friends, and we happened to bump into Robbie and his wife, Ethel, at Seaport Village. It was an unpleasant encounter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe called me a ‚Äòbitch‚Äô and threatened to kill me. He said he‚Äôd make me suffer first before he‚Äôd cut me up into pieces.‚Äù

Cabrera raises a brow. ‚ÄúWhy would he say that to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause he thought I was responsible for Connie and his mother‚Äôs death. How did he die?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe cause is unknown.‚Äù

The corner of Darling‚Äôs lips curves upward. A spark dashes in her eyes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you think I killed him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt does look...‚Äù Alvaro starts to say.

Darling frowns. ‚ÄúSuspicious? Is this about my past husbands?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not a suspect for murder. That‚Äôs not what we are saying,‚Äù Cabrera insists. He looks to his side, and registers Alvaro‚Äôs cynical glare. Her eyes betray her thoughts, despite tight lips‚ÄîThat‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre saying.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll remind you that my sixth husband, Joe, is still alive, and that we‚Äôve been happily married for seven years now!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just trying to piece together the cause of Robert Jacobs‚Äô death. His family wants closure.‚Äù

‚ÄúHis death is the best thing that could have happened to Ethel!‚Äù

The two detectives exchange quick, alarmed glances.

‚ÄúWhy would you say that?‚Äù asks Cabrera.

‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt a good man. Not even a half-decent husband,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúHe was a heavy drinker,‚Äù she shakes her head, ‚Äúand he squandered most of his inheritance on gambling and whores.‚Äù

‚ÄúMrs. Ross, Robert Jacobs‚Äô wife told us that he died the same way that your ex-husband, Connor, and his mother, died,‚Äù says Alvaro.

‚ÄúSo, Robbie was sick?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, he showed flu-like symptoms, skin discoloration, and swelling, especially in the abdomen area.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like he died from natural causes; I figure it had to do with his drinking.‚Äù

‚ÄúJacobs was with a mistress‚Äî‚Äô‚Äô

‚ÄúMistress? Why am I not surprised?‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄîAnd they had gone to a hotel in the evening, but they didn‚Äôt check out the next morning as planned. Jacobs‚Äô body was discovered by a hotel housekeeper. His mistress was found hiding in the bathroom. She claims that she saw a woman in the hotel room with them. Her description matched yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, bullshit!‚Äù Darling blurts out. ‚ÄúPardon my language, but I wasn‚Äôt in the city last week.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôve figured that out.‚Äù

Cabrera interjects, ‚ÄúPerhaps she was seeing things, as she had mentioned that you had red eyes. She also mentioned that your reflection in the mirror resembled a kind of demonic creature.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Ethel Jacobs thinks you had something to do with her husband‚Äôs death,‚Äù Alvaro adds.

‚ÄúMe? How could I be responsible for his death? I didn‚Äôt force him to down bottles of cheap wine.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn her mind, she believes it was witchcraft.‚Äù

‚ÄúWitchcraft? Oh, come on! Detectives, be serious!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we did a little background digging,‚Äù Alvaro says, ‚Äúwe found out that your ex-husbands had also suffered those exact symptoms, and that they died in the same manner.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you really do think it‚Äôs witchcraft?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not all. I‚Äôm not a believer in the supernatural. There‚Äôs a scientific explanation behind these deaths.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe coroner who examined Jacobs‚Äô body suspects that it could be an infectious disease that you may have passed onto him and the others.‚Äù

Darling chortles. ‚ÄúOh, please, I do not carry an infectious disease! I had my regular checkup last month and I have a clean bill of health! And I always wash my hands with soap before I cook! I bathe every day and take every precaution to keep myself in good health. I haven‚Äôt had the flu, or even a cold since childhood.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good to hear, but we think it‚Äôs best if you come with us to the medical clinic and get tested.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, dear; I‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúMrs. Ross‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI might know something that could explain it all,‚Äù Darling says in a coy manner. 

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a long story to tell.‚Äù She drinks her tea and dabs the corners of her lips 
with a napkin.

Alvaro presses on. ‚ÄúOkay, tell us what you know.

‚ÄúFirst, have a taste of my cinnamon bun. You haven‚Äôt even touched it!‚Äù

Taken aback, Alvaro narrows her eyes. ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, go on, dear! Just a bite and tell me what you think.‚Äù

‚ÄúMrs. Ross, this is a serious matter we‚Äôre discussing here!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm serious, too. Try my creamy bun.‚Äù

Alvaro scoffs and nudges Cabrera to say something.

Darling raises a brow. ‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôve poisoned it? Infected it? Oh, don‚Äôt be so silly!‚Äù

Without hesitation, she reaches over to Alvaro‚Äôs plate with a fork and stabs into the bun, slicing off a tiny chunk at the corner. Pure bliss consumes her round, jolly face as she chews on it. Her eyes sparkle with glee.

‚ÄúSee? It‚Äôs baked perfectly. Have a bite! It brings me so much joy to see others enjoy my food.‚Äù

Cabrera nods. ‚ÄúOkay, okay, I‚Äôll have a bite.‚Äù

Might as well anyway, he reasons with himself. He woke up late and skipped breakfast, so he had to wait until lunchtime at the police station canteen. Today‚Äôs menu was a disappointment: a miserly tomato and ham sandwich with no cheese, a cup of assorted fruits, and a salad lightly coated with ranch. Now the glistening buttercream spread on the bun calls to him in a sultry voice only he can hear.

*Eat me*.

He picks up the fork and digs in.

Instant addiction. The sweetness! Its delectable creamy texture! The magical bun‚Äôs flavor lassos him in for a second bite. It melts in his mouth, and the buttercream frosting is heavenly. Like a sweet memory, it lingers in his taste buds.

‚ÄúThis is incredible! Wow!‚Äù he exclaims.

Darling beams. ‚ÄúThank you, Detective. There‚Äôs more if you like.‚Äù

He turns to his partner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unbelievably delicious! Take one bite! Come on, just one!‚Äù

Alvaro throws him a hard look, but with some resistance she caves and haphazardly digs in with her fork.

‚ÄúIt is delicious,‚Äù she says without feeling.

Darling tilts her head and smiles at her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope you‚Äîmmm‚Äîdon‚Äôt mind, Mrs. Ross,‚Äù Cabrera says in between bites, ‚Äúif we record the conversation.‚Äù

He pulls out his smartphone from the pocket of his jacket and places it on the table, switching the voice recorder on.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLike I said, it‚Äôs a long story and there might be details you won‚Äôt be able to remember or write down fast enough.‚Äù

The quiet, unassuming grandmother blows into her chai green and takes a long sip, savoring its warmth and essence. She takes a moment to marvel at the rolling hills, and the other large, adobe houses that dot the landscape. After a moment of meditative calmness, she turns to the detectives.

At once, her profound, dark eyes pierce into theirs, widening into a stare that raises the hairs on Cabrera‚Äôs arms. Such a feeling had not struck him in years. The same sense of visceral dread that he felt when he stared into the pitch black of a gun barrel during a botched hostage negotiation. A sinking feeling of foreboding in his stomach that begged him to abandon ship at once.

*This is it. Go back now, or you will never return.*

He shivers, and Darling Ross begins her story.

Now the glistening buttercream spread on the bun calls to him in a sultry voice only he can hear.

*Eat me*.

He picks up the fork and digs in.

Instant addiction. The sweetness! Its delectable creamy texture! The magical bun‚Äôs flavor lassos him in for a second bite. It melts in his mouth, and the buttercream frosting is heavenly. Like a sweet memory, it lingers in his taste buds.

‚ÄúThis is incredible! Wow!‚Äù he exclaims.

Darling beams. ‚ÄúThank you, Detective. There‚Äôs more if you like.‚Äù

He turns to his partner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unbelievably delicious! Take one bite! Come on, just one!‚Äù

Alvaro throws him a hard look, but with some resistance she caves and haphazardly digs in with her fork.

‚ÄúIt is delicious,‚Äù she says without feeling.

Darling tilts her head and smiles at her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope you‚Äîmmm‚Äîdon‚Äôt mind, Mrs. Ross,‚Äù Cabrera says in between bites, ‚Äúif we record the conversation.‚Äù

He pulls out his smartphone from the pocket of his jacket and places it on the table, switching the voice recorder on.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLike I said, it‚Äôs a long story and there might be details you won‚Äôt be able to remember or write down fast enough.‚Äù

The quiet, unassuming grandmother blows into her chai green and takes a long sip, savoring its warmth and essence. She takes a moment to marvel at the rolling hills, and the other large, adobe houses that dot the landscape. After a moment of meditative calmness, she turns to the detectives.

At once, her profound, dark eyes pierce into theirs, widening into a stare that raises the hairs on Cabrera‚Äôs arms. Such a feeling had not struck him in years. The same sense of visceral dread that he felt when he stared into the pitch black of a gun barrel during a botched hostage negotiation. A sinking feeling of foreboding in his stomach that begged him to abandon ship at once.

*This is it. Go back now, or you will never return.*

He shivers, and Darling Ross begins her story.

1g1qw3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOrville/comments/1g1qw3l/some_of_the_things_in_the_future_dont_really_hold/,"Some of the things in the ""future"" don't really hold up well for me","Don't get me wrong, a lot of the future stuff, I love, like the science stuff of it. The simulator, med scanners, quantum drive, etc. is all really cool and honestly well thought out. 

My issues instead lay more with the things I personally would imagine wouldn't make sense to coexist in that kind of future.

For example, alcohol is a huge part of this show. ""Do you want a drink?"" is asked almost every episode. When Admiral Halsey said he knew Ed and Kelley were drunk, it was more like a mild jab and I was shocked they didn't actually face any significant consequences for it. Also, they can be rid of nicotine, but not pot and booze? Seems like a personal moral preference, not what would probably actually happen in the future. If they phase out some drugs, they will probably phase out all. Especially on a friggin military spaceship. Pot brownies on duty was wild, Kelly.

Furthermore, apparently they haven't figured out how to treat a hangover 400 years in the future, and it's such a thing that bothers me for some reason. Hangovers are mentioned fairly frequently, most notably in the second to last episode when Kelly and Claire are watching the sunrise at her dad's cabin, wincing their hangovers away over a cup of coffee. Claire's commentary confirms the lack of medical hangover cure. Idk why it bothers me so much.

I also dislike the incessant references to 21st century earth culture. I wish they would make up some more historical events, musical artists, etc from the other 3 centuries that occurred before their time. We get it, Dolly Parton rocks. But who rocked in the 2200s?? I hope they don't think the audience is too stupid to integrate some creative b.s. and that we can only be spoon fed Rudolph, iPhones, Macy's and Dolly. 

Another thing that made me roll my eyes was when Admiral Halsey was so confidently lecturing Kaylon Primary that democracy is ""the best form of government, the only one that works."" Be so for real. There isn't one other idea they could have considered for a futuristic, multi-planetary form of council? I could overlook it being the default if it hadn't been so mind-numbingly defended. I felt like I was watching propaganda.

Anyways, these are just some examples I can think of regarding my thoughts on MacFarlane's own beliefs and preferences shining through the show. Bro obviously loves booze, bro loves making references, bro loves democracy, bro has strong opinions on ethical conundrums that usually hold up, but sometimes miss the mark for me. Like how they handled the Darulio situation, as I read in the sub recently.

That being said, none of this really takes away from my enjoyment of the show. I just kinda sighed and rolled my eyes at these things, they kinda shatter my willing suspension of disbelief. Thoughts?",0,1728701834.0,TheOrville,6,0.5,False

# Eating Habits During Weight Loss

I continued to eat foods generally considered refined and high-fat.

# Actions Taken for Weight Loss: Reading and Watching YouTube

When I decided to lose weight, the first thing I did was to understand why people gain weight. Every book and every person has their own perspective. I aimed to comprehensively understand the process to avoid unnecessary effort and suffering.

In the first half-year, I set a general direction and gradually filled in the complete concept, establishing my own personal theory. Summarizing it, the three weight loss theories that influenced me the most are:

1. **Ketogenic Theory + Insulin Theory**: People can use fats as body energy, so you can live well even without eating carbs.
2. **Gut Bacteria Theory**: Everyone‚Äôs gut bacteria are different, so even if you eat the same food, the calories and nutrients absorbed will differ.
3. **Cellular Metabolism Theory**: The ability to use fats as body energy is related to breathing habits, cell lipid composition, and the number of mitochondria.

The order of these three theories happens to be ‚Äúfrom surface problem to root cause.‚Äù If the fundamental functions (gut bacteria imbalance or cellular metabolism imbalance) are damaged, solving the surface problem and implementing the correct diet (low carbs, low sugar) will yield half the results with twice the effort. Conversely, if the fundamental functions are intact, merely changing the surface lifestyle slightly will quickly restore normal functions and reduce unnecessary fat.

# Things to Practice for Weight Loss ‚Äî Categorized by the Three Theories

During 2020‚Äì2022, since I did not exercise at all, I did not practice the third-level ‚ÄúCellular Metabolism Theory.‚Äù During this period, I only practiced the actions required by the ‚ÄúKetogenic Theory + Insulin Theory‚Äù and the ‚ÄúGut Bacteria Theory.‚Äù

Since each of these three theories is a vast topic, I decided to write down the practices and their associated theories in this first article, then explore the principles and reasons behind them in three subsequent articles. Below is a summary of the key points to practice for weight loss, listed in order of importance:

# Ketogenic Theory + Insulin Theory

>**Core Concept**: Make the body lack carbs for a long time and use fats as energy. Eat more Omega 3, eat fewer carbs.

**‚úÖ Things to Do:**

* **Reduce carbs**: Lower the amount of starch (to the point where starch is a side dish), eat more protein and healthy fats, don‚Äôt use fruits as meal replacements, and if you want to eat sweets, eat them after meals.
* **Long periods without eating**: Practice fasting, avoid eating late at night (can eat after meals), and avoid snacking between meals (can eat after meals).
* **Lower insulin**: Fast, reduce starch, eat vegetables and meat before starch, avoid prolonged sitting, stand or walk occasionally, drink apple cider vinegar.
* **Increase Omega 3, reduce Omega 6**: Eat fewer processed foods that can be stored at room temperature for 1 year, eat more whole foods that can only be stored for 1 day at room temperature, choose healthy fats.

**‚ùå Things Not to Do:**

* **Exercise more**: If you want to exercise, walking or climbing 2‚Äì4 flights of stairs is enough.
* **Eat less**: The only things to eat less of are starch and refined sugars. Barbecue, steak, and fine dining can be eaten freely. Fried foods have long-term effects (due to more Omega 6), so you can still eat them occasionally but not often. Long periods without eating (fasting) are far more effective than eating less.
* **Drink more water**: Drink water moderately; your body will know when you need it.

Note that ‚Äúfasting‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúeating less.‚Äù You can refer to the following video for more details.

# Gut Bacteria Theory

>**Core Concept**: Gut bacteria directly affect the nutrients and blood sugar levels you absorb. Increase good bacteria, reduce bad bacteria. If you have more good bacteria, your ‚Äúfat gain defense‚Äù will be stronger.

**‚úÖ Things to Do:**

* **Increase good bacteria**: Eat more fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, yogurt, apple cider vinegar, or foods containing polyphenols like red wine and dark chocolate. Eat fiber-rich foods like vegetables, and take probiotics.
* **Reduce bad bacteria**: If your gut bacteria are already imbalanced, see a doctor, and reduce the frequency of eating fast food and fried foods.

**‚ùå Things Not to Do:**

* **Eat only meat and fats**: If you follow the ‚ÄúKetogenic Theory + Insulin Theory,‚Äù some people completely avoid starch and fiber, causing fiber-eating good bacteria in the gut to become extinct. These people may need to stay on keto for life, otherwise, they will easily regain weight.
* **Take antibiotics arbitrarily**: Antibiotics are like a nuclear bomb for gut bacteria, wiping out both good and bad bacteria. If you have to take them, remember to supplement with probiotics afterward.

# Cellular Metabolism Theory

>**Core Concept**: Obesity and cancer are metabolic diseases. Maintaining cellular metabolic health is the true core of longevity and staying in shape.

**‚úÖ Things to Do:**

* **Get your heart rate to 120‚Äì140**: Strictly speaking, it‚Äôs 70‚Äì80% of your maximum heart rate, which can effectively train mitochondria. You can do weight training, slow jogging, or even ultra-slow jogging ‚Äî as long as it achieves this effect, it‚Äôs effective training.
* **Practice ‚ÄúKetogenic Theory + Insulin Theory‚Äù and ‚ÄúGut Bacteria Theory‚Äù**: If obesity is caused by not following these two theories, it‚Äôs ultimately due to damaging the cell mitochondria‚Äôs metabolic ability. By properly practicing the elements in these theories, you can reduce the chances of damaging metabolic ability.
* **Avoid over-breathing**: Breathe through your nose, and practice breath-holding.

**‚ùå Things Not to Do:**

* **Intense exercise**: Heart rate reaching 180‚Äì200 is intense exercise, which is beyond the range for training mitochondria and is very tiring.

# Implementation: What I Did from 2020 to 2022

Since the above are relatively conceptual theories, you might not know where to start. I‚Äôll share what I actually did during the main weight loss period ‚Äî from 2020 to 2022 ‚Äî as a reference for those who want to try.

# First Half of 2020

At the beginning of researching weight loss topics, my concepts were very superficial, so I only did the following:

**‚úÖ Things Done:**

1. Ate vegetables first, then meat, and finally rice or bread during meals.
2. Stood often while working, making the most of time that could be spent standing.
3. Occasionally took a 15‚Äì20 minute walk after lunch.
4. Avoided starch in regular meals as much as possible, treating starch as a side dish (not restricted during gatherings).
5. Drank unsweetened coffee or tea in the afternoon instead of sugary drinks.
6. Set monthly goals, roughly aiming to lose 1kg per month.
7. Weighed myself daily to thoroughly understand the conditions under which weight changes.

**‚ùå Things Not Done:**

1. **Did not quit drinking**: For a period, I made Gin Fizz, Negroni, and Daiquiri cocktails every day.
2. **Did not exercise**: Completely avoided exercising.
3. **Did not reduce social dining**: Always attended and ate at feasts if necessary.

# Entire Year of 2021

After reading more weight loss theories, I found that some people opposed keto, saying it leads to easy weight regain. Some also said keto wasn‚Äôt effective for them. After diving deeper into why, I adjusted my approach:

**‚úÖ Things Done (in addition to previous practices):**

1. Took probiotics, drank apple cider vinegar, and drank perilla oil.
2. Opted for fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and kombucha when dining out, and also ordered vegetables or salads.
3. Paid attention to the oils used in foods ‚Äî reducing intake if they were high in Omega 6.
4. Occasionally skipped breakfast or ate less for breakfast, only eating vegetables and eggs instead of bread.
5. Occasionally fasted ‚Äî extending periods without eating when possible.
6. Monitored heart rate ‚Äî noticing prolonged sitting lowered it to 65‚Äì68, standing occasionally raised it to 80, avoiding long periods with a heart rate around 65.

**‚ùå Things Not Done:**

1. **Did not eat less meat or fatty meat**: As I categorized meat fats as harmless, I did not care if I ate fatty beef or pork. Regularly ate barbecue, steak, lamb chops, tuna belly, and occasionally fried chicken.
2. **Did not eat less or count calories**: Did not care about ‚Äúfood calories,‚Äù focusing more on whether it was starch. Though I often fasted, I might eat a lot for dinner.

# First Half of 2022

During this period, I wanted to see six-pack abs without exercising, solely through weight loss. A health check revealed liver shadows (initially suspected to be liver disease), prompting two more actions:

**‚úÖ Things Done (in addition to previous practices):**

1. Quit drinking.
2. Practiced breath-holding and controlled breathing.

As a result, weight dropped quickly, reaching around 71kg by June 2022, with a feeling of malnutrition. At this stage, I thought I could start gaining weight again, marking the end of my weight loss journey. From the second half of 2022, I stopped caring about weight and let it naturally return to 74kg.

From January 2023, feeling that weight loss was sufficient (having proven that diet adjustment alone can lead to weight loss without exercise), I started working out to gain muscle, joining a gym program. The goal remains six-pack abs üòÇ. Currently, progress is still far off; after six months, the result is -3kg of fat and +3kg of muscle. The future is uncertain, and I don‚Äôt know what the outcome will be next year.

# Conclusion

Since starting my weight loss journey, I‚Äôve wanted to organize and share my knowledge of ‚Äúobesity‚Äù and weight loss theories. Obesity is not just a matter of appearance; it hides underlying metabolic and inflammation issues, which are factors behind diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, Alzheimer‚Äôs, cataracts, cancer, etc.

Sometimes things aren‚Äôt that difficult; it‚Äôs just that we have incorrect knowledge and use the wrong methods, making the process harder. By understanding the principles of weight gain more comprehensively, we can avoid many detours and achieve twice the results with half the effort.",1,1728701465.0,loseweight,0,0.67,False

I know this is a long post, but it would mean a lot if you read it‚Ä¶

For some context for those that continue to read further, I got sick at 19 years old. Within 3 months of turning 19, I was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency where my body makes absolutely zero cortisol of its own, Graves‚Äô disease that had progressed to the point where my doctor said he‚Äôd never seen anyone ALIVE with my TSH levels - and the cherry on top? A brain tumor. An adenoma on my pituitary, taking up more than half of it. Not too long after, I was diagnosed with multiple complex pain conditions. In this ‚Äúopioid crisis‚Äù hysteria world (let‚Äôs be real though, it‚Äôs an illegal heroin and fentanyl crisis, NOT prescription pills but beside the point), my pain conditions are so bad I have been on a high opioid dosage since my early 20‚Äôs. TL;DR - there is not a moment when I am not in pain. I can‚Äôt remember what that even feels like. 

In college, I wanted to be the best. Despite being extremely sick and constantly taking semesters off of school, I graduated Summa Cum Laude, 3.98 GPA, a member of 6 merit based honor societies, and formally recognized as part of the top 10% of students in the nation. My life was class and illness. I‚Äôve written papers in hospital beds. I ran the academic race with bear traps on my legs and still achieved what I did. 

I never got coffee with a classmate ever. I never made a single friend in college. Same thing with graduate school while earning my Master‚Äôs degree. I simply didn‚Äôt have the spoons and time to try to build relationships when my illnesses limited me. 

Tomorrow I am throwing a birthday party for myself. 28. My mom used to throw me amazingly elaborate birthday parties as a kid - not even like elaborate financially but in sheer creativity. The problem is, when your abusive father starts hitting you in front of your friends, people stop coming over. I haven‚Äôt had a birthday party since then. 

I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends. My best friend is someone I have known since I was 15. A lot of friends left me when I got sick, and she stuck around. I have another friend that I mainly interact with via text. 

But tomorrow, for the first time since I was a child, I‚Äôm having a birthday party with *friends* - not just my family. It‚Äôs only two friends, but to me, it‚Äôs the biggest deal in the world. I know how pathetic that is, trust me. 

It‚Äôs being hosted at my apartment, and I started deep cleaning and my body just broke. I popped some leftover morphine pills I had when I broke my leg and just pushed through. Then I couldn‚Äôt move. 

And I‚Äôm sobbing to my partner and it hurts because he cannot possibly understand. Ask any sick person and they will describe their lives as two separate parts - life before illness and life after illness. I have a mind that says, ‚ÄúGO GO GO‚Äù and a body that imprisons me. I don‚Äôt lack the motivation, the drive, the desire to strive for excellence - *it‚Äôs just that my body cannot do it* 

I always knew when I first was told what my life would look like living with my conditions that there would be times where I simply won‚Äôt be able to do what others can. But this party is so important to me. 

I‚Äôm just caught in this heartbreaking sense of failure, and I honestly I am posting to seek support and comfort who know what this experience is like. 

If you read this far, I really appreciate you. Thank you for caring enough to take the time. ",7,1728701450.0,ChronicIllness,3,0.9,False

1g1qr3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/rs_x/comments/1g1qr3w/i_have_withered_my_own_brain_through_selfimposed/,"I have withered my own brain through self-imposed solitary confinement, and now I have a court date coming up. ","For the past year I have been a paranoid wreck, to the point that I have barely left the house for a year. All I do is take my Vyvanse, chug cold instant coffee and cold green tea, do jumping jacks/squats/push-ups, take care of my puppy, do chores/clean up the house and then retreat to my room when my mum comes home from work. For the most part I‚Äôm very timid and deferential to my mother, but there are times when I lose my better judgement and become a horrific monster.

This upcoming court date is because of that horrific lapse in judgement. 

I was having a particularly rough night, and as I was taking out the garbage, my mum got angry at me for slapping the front door because I was annoyed that it was locked. I snapped, I started screaming at her and in my blind rage I destroyed an old wooden door and punched holes in the walls of my room. I awoke from my blind rage and instantly regretted my actions, breaking down crying in my room. My mum called 000 because she wanted the paramedics to take me to hospital for a mental health check, the cops came instead.

I was charged with malicious damage of property and arrested and taken to the police station. My mother begged the cops to not take me and that she didn‚Äôt want to press charges, but the cops arrested me and put me in the back of the paddywagon and took me to the holding cell at the police station. 

I was in no state to protest, and I was a timid nervous wreck the whole time. This was the first time I ever had contact with police in this way. The whole time at the police station, they were gentle with me (in large part because of my lack of protesting against them) and they even had the mental health nurse talk to me. They refused to interview me, due to my ‚Äúinability to properly represent myself‚Äù, I think due to my autism but I don‚Äôt know for sure why they didn‚Äôt interview me.

I was placed under a Domestic Violence order and released on bail to my home with my mother, with an upcoming court date. This whole time my mother, the victim in this case, has been helping me with attaining character statements from people that know me and also  arranging a lawyer to represent me. I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs helping me, but I‚Äôve been more than grateful for her help and her compassion.

I intend to plead guilty, but my lawyer is intending to argue for a dismissal of my case based on my mother‚Äôs forgiveness and the fact that this is my first offence, as well as my mental health issues and the character statements from people that know me.

I don‚Äôt know if I deserve a dismissal of my case. The maximum penalty that I‚Äôm facing is 2 years in jail and a $2,200 fine. I‚Äôll leave everything to my lawyer, but I can‚Äôt get past the feeling that I do not deserve leniency. 

I‚Äôm very very ashamed of what I have done, infinitely more so than my regular sense of shame. 

Would it be good for me to accept the prison time? Or should I actually believe everyone who is helping me when they say that ‚Äúthis is not you, you won‚Äôt go to jail, you‚Äôre a first offender, it never should have been a court matter, the magistrate will see that you‚Äôre a good boy‚Äù? I don‚Äôt know what to do, I know that this has been a giant reshaping of my mind and has caused me to completely calm down and never do anything like that ever again, but would the jail time actually ‚Äòbrand‚Äô that lesson onto my brain forever? Would the jail time actually help me? 

There were a few people that I met from here that were very nice, but I‚Äôve had to cut myself off from them because I feel dangerous and horrible and undeserving of their time.

This was met with backlash saying that it would ""hurt small businesses"" and then changed the messaging to ""buy local"".

I don't understand the shift. It still encourages people to consume, whether it's from a local shop or a big chain. If the message is ""if you're forcing me back in the office, I'm not buying shit because you can't force me into capitalism"" vs ""let me buy this $26 lunch from a local salad place."" Then that's still capitalism. 

I'm disappointed to see this kind of messaging. I work downtown and bring my coffee and lunch to work every time. I forgot my coffee at home one time, bought from a local coffee shop (it was not as good as I make at home) and after that I made sure never to forget it again.

Well tonight after sharing a steak dinner with my wife, I decided to grab the earbuds and another cold one and retreat to the moonlit backyard for a listen. I ran to the porch like a kid at 6:00 on a Christmas morning (*boooo*). Queued the track on Spotify and set the volume to ~85%.

I was expecting the single to be in C standard tuning or use the 7-string, but like Jordan, I have perfect pitch and realized it was standard tuning. No biggie, but surprising to me.

I knew Andy Sneap mixed the record, so of course it was going to sound stellar. That assumption was correct.

Hearing Portnoy build it up with the drums just felt so right, and I appreciate the Mangini albums (DOT is my #6 favorite). The snare has a very deep and punchy sound, and the octobans are so familiar.

LaBrie is keeping the vocal melodies within his range, and even though some people might find it to be a bit too restrained, I welcome it.

Myung‚Äôs bass is thick and has a good grind to it.

Rudess didn‚Äôt go over-the-top crazy this time. I did notice the different pad sounds and the unison with Petrucci was tight as always.

Petrucci‚Äôs performance was the real highlight for me. Not just the awesome verse riff that wasn‚Äôt just an open string chug, and the slow melodic solo was beautiful, but we get to hear his warm backing vocals again. It‚Äôs been too damn long! I‚Äôve always likened his voice to a warm cup of morning coffee, sublime.

It‚Äôs also great to hear the live-feeling solo section that omits rhythm guitar. Really gives Myung, Rudess and Portnoy space.

Gotta buy my show ticket ASAP! I‚Äôm thinking February 12th in Biloxi, and maybe I‚Äôll save the full album for the drive! Have never been this excited for the new DT album as a fan who first heard Images and Words in 2011!",2,1728701066.0,Dreamtheater,1,0.75,False

","My boyfriend has recently returned to university as a mature after a long hiatus from education. He is completing a fairly challenging stem degree and so I accepted he would have to commit more time to his work, but his reconnection with mathematics has become concerning.

He now spends a majority of his day 'studying mathematics', despite the fact I often see very little work being done. When I ask him how his work is going, he gets very defensive and refuses to open up, claiming it's in my best interest because 'it will be boring to me anyway'. He then retreats to his room, where I hear either classical music, or the now familiar voice of youtuber 'The Maths Sorcerer' through the door (Some kind of mathematics based motivaitonal guru).

He also has taken up chainsmoking during the day, which although I'm personally not too bothered by, has become another issue where he becomes very defensive. He regularly sends me studies and reddit anecdotes about the efficacy of chainsmoking as a nootropic, and how universities like MIT are littered with cigarette smoke from 'high performance humans'.

He goes so far as to tell me that all of the greats such as Betrand Russel, Einsten and 'Rachmandynoff'(?) were all habitual smokers (Anyone know who tf that last person even is?)

I've tried to contact his friends to see if he shares more about his new secretive lifestyle with them, to which I was told that he basically just talks about drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, eating eggs and doing mathematics without going into any further detail.

I feel like he has completely changed personalities and lives as some kind of isolated savant rather than my loving boyfriend and I have to fight to even spend time together. I want to try and maybe meet him where he's at and become more interested in what he's doing, but he just keeps everthing so secretive?

I know this is a long post, but it would mean a lot if you read it‚Ä¶

For some context for those that continue to read further, I got sick at 19 years old. Within 3 months of turning 19, I was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency where my body makes absolutely zero cortisol of its own, Graves‚Äô disease that had progressed to the point where my doctor said he‚Äôd never seen anyone ALIVE with my TSH levels - and the cherry on top? A brain tumor. An adenoma on my pituitary, taking up more than half of it. Not too long after, I was diagnosed with multiple complex pain conditions. In this ‚Äúopioid crisis‚Äù hysteria world (let‚Äôs be real though, it‚Äôs an illegal heroin and fentanyl crisis, NOT prescription pills but beside the point), my pain conditions are so bad I have been on a high opioid dosage since my early 20‚Äôs. TL;DR - there is not a moment when I am not in pain. I can‚Äôt remember what that even feels like. 

In college, I wanted to be the best. Despite being extremely sick and constantly taking semesters off of school, I graduated Summa Cum Laude, 3.98 GPA, a member of 6 merit based honor societies, and formally recognized as part of the top 10% of students in the nation. My life was class and illness. I‚Äôve written papers in hospital beds. 

I never got coffee with a classmate ever. I never made a single friend in college. Same thing with graduate school while earning my Master‚Äôs degree. I simply didn‚Äôt have the spoons and time to try to build relationships when my illnesses limited me. 

Tomorrow I am throwing a birthday party for myself. 28. My mom used to throw me amazingly elaborate birthday parties as a kid - not even like elaborate financially but in sheer creativity. The problem is, when your abusive father starts hitting you in front of your friends, people stop coming over. I haven‚Äôt had a birthday party since then. 

I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends. My best friend is someone I have known since I was 15. A lot of friends left me when I got sick, and she stuck around. I have another friend that I mainly interact with via text. 

But tomorrow, for the first time since I was a child, I‚Äôm having a birthday party with *friends* - not just my family. It‚Äôs only two friends, but to me, it‚Äôs the biggest deal in the world. I know how pathetic that is, trust me. 

It‚Äôs being hosted at my apartment, and I started deep cleaning and my body just broke. I popped some leftover morphine pills I had when I broke my leg and just pushed through. Then I couldn‚Äôt move. 

And I‚Äôm sobbing to my partner and it hurts because he cannot possibly understand. Ask any sick person and they will describe their lives as two separate parts - life before illness and life after illness. I have a mind that says, ‚ÄúGO GO GO‚Äù and a body that imprisons me. I don‚Äôt lack the motivation, the drive, the desire to strive for excellence - *it‚Äôs just that my body cannot do it* 

I always knew when I first was told what my life would look like living with my conditions that there would be times where I simply won‚Äôt be able to do what others can. But this party is so important to me. 

I‚Äôm just caught in this heartbreaking sense of failure, and I honestly I am posting to seek support and comfort who know what this experience is like.

I stayed at Nick‚Äôs far longer than I ought to. The guy was rarely ever home anyway, spending most of his time either working overtime or helping at his brother‚Äôs garage. Nick didn‚Äôt talk much about his brother, but he seemed to be a hard-working red-blooded kind of guy. Nick would only talk about him in ways that would start with ‚Äòthis one time, Tommy did the craziest shit‚Äô.

I crashed on the couch. My place needed some serious renovation, and the only one able to do the work was this carpenter from the Babin apartment complex. I only saw him in passing. He had the look of a hunched-over vulture in human form. Nick advised me not to set foot near my place until the guy was done through and through.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna meet Roy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGuy‚Äôs a freak.‚Äù

¬†

One night as I lay awake on the couch, Nick tip-toed past me to get a midnight beer. I waved an arm at him.

‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt sleeping,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNo need to sneak.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just light on my feet,‚Äù Nick said, wandering over. ‚ÄúYou want one?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell.‚Äù

He handed me a beer and slumped down on the lazy boy chair next to me. We looked at the TV. It was still on, but there was a countdown warning us about it shutting down in about a minute after prolonged inactivity. Some kind of power saving thing.

‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt believe this shit,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúThere are, like, actual unreal things out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Nick sighed. ‚ÄúTakes some time to wrap your head around.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow far does it go? Like‚Ä¶ demons? Angels? That kinda thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno. Maybe.‚Äù

Nick shrugged the question off, downing two big gulps of beer in one go. He sighed, leaning back in his chair; suddenly looking a lot more tired. He wasn‚Äôt gonna make it back to bed.

‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs just one of those things.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust one of those things, huh?‚Äù

He shot me a final tired look, cracking a coffee-stained yellow smile.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pretend like you knew how the world worked before you got here, rookie. You had no idea.‚Äù

I mean, he wasn‚Äôt wrong. Nick was out like a light, leaving his beer dangling from his hand. I plucked it from him, keeping it from spilling all over the carpet.

¬†

Looking back at those early days, any normal person would‚Äôve left town long ago. But it wasn‚Äôt that easy. I got the impression that making too much noise might get you in trouble. And not just ‚Äòa little note on your personal record‚Äô kind of trouble, but the kind of trouble where you‚Äôre pushed into a van and never seen again. Nick was one of the most relaxed people I‚Äôd ever met, and even he spoke of the DUC like they were boogeymen. The Department of Unknown Crises. What the hell kind of name is that?

The good thing about being far down the chain of command is that you‚Äôre rarely involved in big picture-stuff. The sheriff and his coordinators spent days on their own, leaving ordinary officers like Nick and I to deal with the day-to-day issues. We caught a guy speeding, checked out a couple of broken windows, helped a drunk guy get home‚Ä¶ nothing out of the ordinary. And for most of January, and the start of February, that was it.

That is, until we got a call about the Rosemills.

¬†

The Rosemills worked at the local middle school. They were a husband and wife of about 50 years old. You could spot them sometimes sitting together at the local caf√©, talking away for hours. It was kinda sweet to see two people so in love, even after more than two decades together, reportedly. I didn‚Äôt know them personally, but still, I‚Äôd hate for something to happen to them. They seemed like decent people.

We got a call that the Rosemills hadn‚Äôt been seen for a while, and we were asked to do a wellness check. Nothing out of the ordinary; we‚Äôd done a couple of those at that time. So off we went.

¬†

It was the last thing Nick and I were supposed to do that day. It was late afternoon, and the sun was already setting. We rolled up to the Rosemills‚Äô home, parked our car, and stepped out. Having a quick look around, I could tell something was off. Nick stopped when he realized I wasn‚Äôt following him.

‚ÄúNo tracks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs been around for days.‚Äù

I could tell what Nick was thinking pretty well by now. He was thinking that maybe they‚Äôd skipped town. Without saying a word, I shook my head and pointed a flashlight to the side of the house. Their car was still parked there, covered in snow.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Nick sighed. ‚ÄúYou go out back, I‚Äôll check the shed. Roll back in five.‚Äù

¬†

There was a broken window out back, and a couple of snowed-over tracks leading down a hill. Signs of a struggle. Possibly a second set of tracks, but it was hard to tell. It kinda looked like someone had either jumped out or been thrown out a window. I called it in to Nick with my radio and followed the tracks.

As I peeked over the edge of the hill, my heart dropped.

The lady of the home, Lacey Rosemill, lay dead about 20 feet further down; impaled by what looked like a long steel rod. I yelled at Nick to hurry on over. I was already on my way down the hill, calling it in to dispatch. I spoke out my last name, badge number, address, victim, and reported is as a suspected one-eighty-seven. Seconds later, I heard Nick following me down the hill. As soon as he saw the body, he also called it in.

‚ÄúCancel that, dispatch,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúPatrick‚Äôs out.‚Äù

¬†

Lacey Rosemill was dead in the snow. Face down, with a frozen pool of blood spread out underneath. She‚Äôd done her best to get away. Signs of struggle on her arms. Buried in her back was what looked like a piece of sharpened rebar; the tail end of it was longer than my arm. I looked at Nick, dumbfounded. He rolled his eyes.

‚ÄúThis happens sometimes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I mention Patrick?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got a killer on the loose?‚Äù I snapped back. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre not doing anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that. Come on.‚Äù

¬†

He brought me back up to the house. The front door was open, and the hinges were barely holding on to the stale wood. The house was covered in this cheap peeling paint, leaving flakes of green and white across the porch. As we stepped inside the house, flashlights at the ready, Nick explained.

‚ÄúPatrick isn‚Äôt really his name, it‚Äôs just what we call him. Patrick. Like Bateman. American Psycho, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre not putting him away? Not even after this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no point,‚Äù Nick continued. ‚ÄúThe guy just kinda comes and goes. I saw him get hit by a truck once, and a couple of days later he walked out of Lake Attabat like nothing‚Äôd happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt work like that, Nick. People don‚Äôt come back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho said he‚Äôs people?‚Äù

¬†

As we moved through the house, I got the impression that Nick was looking for something. He kept checking for trap doors and hidden compartments.

‚ÄúThing with Patrick is that he doesn‚Äôt just kill anyone, right? He kills just the right kind of people.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the right kind of people?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe kind of people that‚Äôll end up hurting a whole bunch of other people in the long run.‚Äù

I helped Nick flip over a dinner table, checking a storage compartment connected to the kitchen floor. Nothing but old booze and a couple of valuables. Nick didn‚Äôt seem interested.

‚ÄúA couple of years ago, there was a guy who lived out by Saint Gall, right? And he had this, uh‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs call it *unhealthy interest*, in some of the locals. Now, the guy hadn‚Äôt done anything yet, but we all got the creeps from him, and we didn‚Äôt really know what he was up to.‚Äù

Nick turned to me, making a finger gun. I could see my reflection in his pink sunglasses.

‚ÄúPow. Out comes Patrick, taking the guy out with a piece of rebar fired from a homemade crossbow. Whole thing‚Äôs made from an old Volkswagen spring leaf. That thing could behead a goddamn rhinoceros.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut the guy hadn‚Äôt done anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue, true,‚Äù nodded Nick. ‚ÄúBut the sick shit we found in that old-timer‚Äôs hippy-hut sure indicated that he was about to. And that‚Äôs the thing with Patrick. It‚Äôs like he just knows when shit‚Äôs about to go down.‚Äù

¬†

I was starting to get the idea. Nick was looking for whatever had caused Patrick to attack these people. In his mind, there had to be some kind of reason behind the violence. A justification. We searched for about half an hour before we ended up in their bedroom, going through their clothes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what we‚Äôre looking for,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ guns?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes it doesn‚Äôt show,‚Äù said Nick. ‚ÄúBut Patrick never fails. Not once. If you end up killin‚Äô people, indirect or otherwise, he might have something to say about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt that mean that him *not* killing this Digman guy means‚Ä¶ Digman‚Äôs off the hook?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said killin‚Äô *people*, rookie. Digman and his kin ain‚Äôt people.‚Äù

¬†

Finally, something white reflected back at me. A box of something in the back of Lacey Rosemills‚Äô wardrobe. I brought it out for Nick to see.

It wasn‚Äôt anything incriminating. It looked like a box of unpainted Halloween masks. Plain white, with black straps. Some of them had an air filter, others had black felt to hide your eyes. They looked pretty expensive, but I‚Äôd never seen anything quite like it before. They weren‚Äôt factory-made. There were too many imperfections; like the faces had been carved out by hand with a fine tool. There was a shipping stamp on the side of the box, indicating they‚Äôd ordered it from somewhere about a week prior.

I picked a mask up, looking it over. It had a strong jawline and an ambiguous smile.

‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs kinda handsome,‚Äù I grinned.

Nick rushed over, almost tripping over his own feet. He smacked the mask out of my hands, bruising my thumb. Before I had the chance to protest, he pointed at me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fucking touch these things. Don‚Äôt.‚Äù

¬†

After that, things turned into a circus. Nick called it in, and this time we caught some attention of the higher-ups. Apparently, the masks were noteworthy. I didn‚Äôt really get it ‚Äì to me it was just a box of masks. And we still hadn‚Äôt found the husband, he was still out there.

I ended up working overtime. As the sun set, I sat down with Nick. We‚Äôd just finished putting up the tape over the doors and windows. The Rosemills‚Äô yard was flooded with law enforcement.

‚ÄúThose masks are bad news,‚Äù Nick explained as the body of Lacey Rosemill was carried off in the distance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had some issues with ‚Äòem before. We thought they‚Äôd migrated to West Virginia, but they seem to be back.‚Äù

‚ÄúMasks don‚Äôt migrate,‚Äù I added.

‚ÄúThose masks fuck you up,‚Äù Nick corrected. ‚ÄúAnd not in a ha-ha kinda way, but like‚Ä¶ they mess with your head.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo someone handing them out might be bad enough to get Patrick to kill you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, big time,‚Äù Nick nodded. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs gonna be a manhunt for ol‚Äô Tucker Rosemill tonight. And I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs about to read him his rights.‚Äù

¬†

Before we called it a night, Nick was asked to make a statement to sheriff Mason. Meanwhile, I stayed outside, checking out the firepower we‚Äôd called in. The equivalent of an unmarked SWAT team, all without texts or markings. Eerie people. The kind of people who don‚Äôt think twice about putting down a threat.

I caught a last look at the box of masks. It was just sitting there in the back of a van, covered with literal red tape. On top was a plastic blue sunflower seal; something to mark the box as something from Tomskog, Minnesota.

I thought about how easy it‚Äôd be. You could pick up one of those masks in a second, just to try it on. A couple of them looked kinda cool. One of them sort of looked like me, but like, an idealized version. A little softer, a little thinner. I‚Äôd look good in it. A bit creepy, but good.

But looking at the armed guard standing by the van, I wasn‚Äôt about to take any chances. I may be reckless, but I‚Äôm not an idiot.

¬†

I was still crashing at Nick‚Äôs place, so I waited for him to come back. I was just sitting in the passenger seat, legs up on the dashboard, dozing off a little. It‚Äôd been a rough couple of nights. I didn‚Äôt know what to think of this whole ordeal, but by the looks of it, it was out of our hands. Still, that image of Lacey Rosemill face down in the snow‚Ä¶ it felt unreal. People in Tomskog seemed so used to death and destruction that it barely phased them. Maybe that‚Äôd rub off on me over time.

As I daydreamed, I saw a new figure wander onto the crime scene.

This guy was easily around 6‚Äô8. He wore this white poncho with a pair of garden gloves; those with rubber fingertips for a better grip. Tossed over his should was this massive crossbow, along with a makeshift bag of rebar-like bolts. He covered his face with some kind of world war two era rubber gas mask. Filterless.

He sort of wandered onto the scene like it was nothing. I saw how armed men and women made way, letting him pass by unobstructed. Some barely looked at him, as if used to seeing him. I got out of the car to get a better look at him and ended up following him back to the hill where he‚Äôd shot Lacey Rosemill.

He calmly wandered over to her tarp-covered crime scene, picked up the rebar bolt, and put it back into his quiver. Then he wandered off like nothing‚Äôd happened.

Seeing a whole crowd of policemen not as much as raise an eyebrow was absurd. This was the bizarro world of police work. A couple of the SWAT guys seemed to have questions, but their superiors just sort of shook their heads at them. The guy just wandered off.

¬†

As Nick drove me back to his place that night, I couldn‚Äôt help but bring up the elephant in the room. Before I even opened my mouth, I could hear him groaning.

‚ÄúYou really okay with this, Nick?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúHaving people killed? Is that justice?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ I mean, it‚Äôs not about that,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúLike it or not, it‚Äôs gonna happen.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt just feels weird. Like we‚Äôre watching this from the sidelines.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe kind of are. Nature‚Äôs correcting itself.‚Äù

We quieted down, watching the black road ahead. I thought back to early mornings with my mom, hearing her talk about the various dilemmas she‚Äôd run into on her patrols. The cut and dry, the black and white. There was no room for interpretation. But here in Tomskog?

Here we had Patrick.

‚ÄúYou get a feeling for these things,‚Äù Nick sighed. ‚ÄúSort of.‚Äù

¬†

That night would turn out to be my last night at Nick‚Äôs. I got a text early the next morning that my windows and floors were all done. I‚Äôd need some new furniture, but apart from that, I was good to go. My car had been back from the shop for a while, but it just felt excessive to drive around with both mine and Nick‚Äôs. We always went to the same places anyway.

That morning was an all hands on deck kinda deal. Like Nick had said, Tucker Rosemill was a target. There were pictures of him on the whiteboard by the entrance. People were already out talking to known associates and trying to draw up a timeline. It felt like a reverse-murder, in a way. We were looking for the victim rather than the murderer.

Nick and I were kept out of it, for the most part. Everyone was asked to call in if we saw Tucker, but apart from that, we were on regular patrol duty.

¬†

While Nick didn‚Äôt seem all too bothered by this, I was having doubts. While most of the day was business as usual, I had this sneaking suspicion that some damage had already been done. People were looking at us differently, and I spotted a couple of boxes by some trash cans that looked an awful lot like the one we‚Äôd seen at the Rosemills‚Äô place. But if these mask things were such a problem, wouldn‚Äôt they have popped up by now? But despite it all, I didn‚Äôt see a single mask. I didn‚Äôt hear a word about them. And yet I couldn‚Äôt shake this feeling that something was up.

That night I went home to my own place, with my own car. I was looking forward to it. A couch to crash on is nice for a couple of weeks or so, but you really start to notice things you take for granted. Like privacy.

But as I got in my car, I looked at the passenger seat.

There was a white mask there.

¬†

It was the same that I‚Äôd seen back at the Rosemills‚Äô place. The exact same. The one I‚Äôd wondered about. There were no broken windows, no forced locks; none of it. It was just there. But it didn‚Äôt feel intrusive. If anything, it felt like it had found its way home.

I picked it up. My first instinct was to try it on, but I saw the bruise on my thumb from where Nick had slapped me the other day. It was only a speck of a bruise, but it was there. With a reluctant flick of the wrist, I tossed the mask into the back of the car, promising myself to get rid of it later.

I decided I ought to drop by Nick‚Äôs brother and give him my thanks for helping with the car. While I was there, I figured I‚Äôd check if there was something wrong with the door locks. People can‚Äôt usually get into cars willy-nilly.

¬†

Going by the garage, I could tell something was off. One of the doors was wide open, and there was no one around. I parked by the far end of the lot, checking the place out at a distance. No immediate danger, it seemed.

I got out and had a look around. There were no cars parked. There was one in the shop, still under repair, but that was it. No one was around. I could walk right in and clear out the register without anyone having the slightest idea. A little plastic sign with a cheerful ‚Äúback in a snap‚Äù text swung back and forth by the main entrance.

I tried giving Nick a call, but couldn‚Äôt get through. But something tickled my spine. I heard something.

¬†

Going inside, I noticed something odd by one of the bathrooms. The door was slightly tilted, and the water was still running. Rubber marks on the floor, like there‚Äôd been a struggle. In the next room over, I could find a storage space for spare parts; as well as a fresh, empty box. One that looked eerily similar to the one I‚Äôd seen at the Rosemills‚Äô place.

And right next to it, on the floor, was Nick‚Äôs phone. I must‚Äôve heard it vibrating.

I had a radio back in my car, so I called it in. I mentioned to dispatch that I couldn‚Äôt get ahold of Nick, and that there were signs of a fight. I was hit back with a deluge of issues. There were people missing from the night shift. Delayed transports. Sudden communication blackouts. It seemed that this entire operation had begun to fall apart, piece by piece. I looked back on my mask, now resting comfortably on full display in the back seat of my car. Could that little thing really be that bad? It was just a‚Ä¶ thing.

While the sheriff hadn‚Äôt called me in yet, I decided to get back to the station. At the very least to see if anyone had heard something from Nick.

I got in my car and headed straight for the station, stopping only for a red light. I took a sharp turn, glancing back to make sure I didn‚Äôt cut anyone off. I caught something in the rear-view mirror ‚Äì something *inside* *my* *car*.

Someone had hidden in the back seat.

A second later - they‚Äôd put the mask over my face.

¬†

Now, it wasn‚Äôt like I changed into a different person. This thing didn‚Äôt just make me into something I‚Äôm not. The only thing I felt as it was put on was this outburst of emotion. Like it was okay for me to act out. Okay to do anything, really. Like the anonymity of this thing was so palpable that it ate away at my inhibitions.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure what happened next. I remember these weird flashes. I pulled over, opened the back door on the passenger side, and proceeded to beat the everliving shit out of whoever was there. I just remember a lot of blood and a handful of teeth, and this burning sensation on my knuckles.

And laughter.¬† A whole lot of laughter. I think it was mine.

¬†

What‚Äôs scary about these masks is not what they do to you right then and there ‚Äì but what you feel afterwards. In the moment, all you feel is this elation. You can do whatever you want and get away with it. No one can stop you, it seems. It‚Äôs this sense of ever-growing freedom, and the longer you keep it on, the better it feels.

But looking back at it, I could‚Äôve done anything. I was *vulnerable*. I could‚Äôve jumped off a cliff, just because I wanted to feel the wind rush against my arms. I could‚Äôve dove headlong into traffic for a chance to see a funny face on a surprised driver. There was this endless potential, and nothing to stop me.

So with my mask firmly secured, I did as was expected.

I went with the flow.

¬†

It was so easy to meet the others. I could feel them. It‚Äôs as if my senses were laser-focused to spot the masks in the distance. And we just‚Ä¶ ganged up. Then we let loose.

I remember shooting out streetlights with my handgun down by Frog Lake. We duct-taped a guy to a bench and stole his wallet. Another masked person ripped up a bunch of dollar bills and tried to feed them to the ducks at the pond, but they seemed less than interested. I don‚Äôt even know who the other masked people were, but we all sort of looked the same, so it just made sense to join forces.

There was a lot of broken glass, cuts on my hands, screaming. Someone getting beaten with a chair leg. A fire alarm, a burglar alarm, gunshots ‚Äì and this endless, ecstatic laughter. I laughed so hard my lungs hurt, and that little voice in the back of my mind that told me stop had just‚Ä¶ died. To this day, I‚Äôm not entirely sure what happened that night. Thinking about how easy it would‚Äôve been for me to kill, or be killed‚Ä¶ it turns my stomach.

Everyone just spoke whatever came to mind. There were no filters. Some were screaming the most vile, disgusting crap ‚Äì others just confessed to whatever they had hidden away in the back of their head. I don‚Äôt remember half of what I screamed, but I remember one thing. It‚Äôs hard to forget. I remember us cornering someone, and as I stared into the face of a terrified, unmasked stranger, I screamed at the top of my lungs.

‚ÄúThe law ain‚Äôt *shit*. You‚Äôre not worth *shit*. This is all *shit*!‚Äù

¬†

There were at least two dozen of us. Some broke into the high school. Others, myself included, decided to go running into a field. Someone tripped, breaking an ankle - the rest of us laughed and beat them with a shovel. We took turns, made it into a sort of game. I remember the palms of my hands burning. I had shards of glass stuck in them, and I didn‚Äôt even care to pull them out.

At some point I collapsed from exhaustion. I watched as pine trees swayed in the wind. It was a freezing February night, and the sweat on the inside of my mask was freezing. Long strips of my hair turned into icicles. Somewhere in the distance, I heard movement. I rolled my tired head over to the side, looking into the distance.

It was a person with a mask of their own, but it looked‚Ä¶ different.

¬†

The others turned to him too, almost reverently. This sense of calm fell over us, like seeing an old friend, or a beloved parent. He had this gray hoodie that barely covered his unnaturally long limbs, covered in insect-like thick hair. The mask he wore looked a little different, like an exaggerated Greek drama kind of thing. Except, it moved. Looking closer, it seemed that it wasn‚Äôt just a mask.

That was its actual face.

It slowly moved across the field, bowing down to check on us. Every masked person got their straps tightened and a rough hand brushing their hair aside. Like a caring mother tending to its young.

¬†

It looked me in the eye without a flinch of malice. It was curious, and eager. Joyful, even. To that thing, we had been given an amazing gift.

It just didn‚Äôt understand.

And for some reason, I thought it was kinda‚Ä¶ handsome.

¬†

By morning, things were dire. I was hypothermic, but the mask sort of muddled the feel of it. Also, the snow was surprisingly isolating. Who knew you could get warm from covering yourself in snow?

A handful of us managed to get up and walk through that field in the early morning. Some stayed down, either dead, unconscious, or giglging. It was surreal watching those white masks glisten in the sunlight as we shook and stumbled our way back towards town.

But we didn‚Äôt make it far.

¬†

I was completely blindsided. Out of nowhere, something smacked me on the side of the head, breaking the side of the mask wide open and sending me crashing to the ground. As the mask broke, my first instinct was to try and put it back on. I didn‚Äôt even realize I was doing it. My head rung, and I could barely keep my eyes open. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was from hypothermia, sleep deprivation, or a budding concussion. Take your pick.

It was Patrick.

The massive guy with the crossbow. He‚Äôd elbowed me to the ground. How a guy his size had shown up out of nowhere was beyond me, but maybe I wasn‚Äôt really in the best shape to pay attention. He had this hook on his belt that he used to prime the crossbow. He stepped down on the frame, hooking the cable to his belt, and pushing. It clicked; vibrating with terrible force. It was ready to fire. Pulling a slice of sharpened rebar from his quiver, he prepped the shot and looked down at me; as if making a judgement call.

He had these terrifying eyes. The skin was so dry that it looked like tobacco, and neither eye was even fully open. He didn‚Äôt blink. He just looked at me.

¬†

I hadn‚Äôt even realized I was scared. It‚Äôd been so quick that I‚Äôd barely registered what happened. But there he was, ready to do what needed to be done. Patrick killed those who killed others, and in my line of work, especially in this town, it was inevitable. I felt this bottomless hopelessness sink into my chest, like a black puddle. I shook my head, turning away.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna kill if I have to,‚Äù I shuddered. ‚ÄúI might have to. I might.‚Äù

His finger was on the trigger. The rattle of a steel spring, aching to release. I held a hand up, shielding myself, despite knowing that a bolt would pierce straight through me if given the chance. Hell, it‚Äôd skewer a car.

I didn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd done that previous night. I could‚Äôve killed someone. It was a blur.

I was a twitch of a finger away from death.

But Patrick just turned away, looking over the field. And as casual as taking a breath, he raised the crossbow, and fired.

¬†

The bolt soared through the air like a whistling rocket, striking a mask-wearer in the neck. Even at a distance I could hear a snap and watch as the body went limp. The head almost came clean off, rolling back and forth with a severed spine. That force was terrifying. At close range, that thing would‚Äôve destroyed me.

Without a word, he wandered off; letting the crossbow rest over his shoulder. He was done.

¬†

I stumbled forward, barely managing to reach an unconscious mask-wearer. I fumbled through his pockets, hoping to find a phone. I didn‚Äôt find anything, so I decided to rip off the mask and hope for the best. Maybe he‚Äôd make it.

It was Nick. He was in bad shape. Real bad.

I rushed to find help. I ended up checking the pockets of the man that Patrick had killed. I‚Äôm not going to describe the sensation of rifling through a dead man‚Äôs clothes, but let‚Äôs just say it was‚Ä¶ visceral. He did have a phone though. I managed to get a call through to the emergency services, which in turn managed to patch me through to Tomskog PD. Within minutes, help was on the way.

I caught a glimpse of the face of the dead man. Turns out it was Tucker Rosemill; the other half of the duo that had imported these masks to begin with.

¬†

I sat with an unconscious Nick for what felt like an eternity. He looked weird without his pink sunglasses ‚Äì almost normal. I figured someone must‚Äôve gotten to him at his brother‚Äôs garage. Maybe the same way they got to me; by getting backup keys and hiding in the back seat.

By the time medics arrived, Nick was on the edge of waking up. I think I caught a smile as he looked up at me. Maybe he was just happy to see a familiar face; not covered in a white mask.

‚Äú‚Ä¶*I ain‚Äôt sleepin‚Äô*‚Äù he slurred.

¬†

It‚Äôd take some time to recover. I had to get a couple of stitches for the glass in my hands, but both Nick and I would be on our feet in a couple of weeks. The sheriff granted us sick leave, so that was something. It gave me time to set up new furniture at my place after the Hank Byrne incident.

There were no more killings from Patrick for a while. Most of the mask-wearers either wore themselves out or accidentally broke their masks over time. There was no one there to fix them or help them; it‚Äôs as if both the distributor, and the mysterious creator, had no intention of coming back.

I‚Äôm not sure why. Looking back at it, that time is a blur, but it evokes the same feeling as dancing on the edge of a cliff. I was just moments away from disaster, and I would‚Äôve welcomed it with open arms.

That awful, whole-hearted abandon.

","(Hello, today I come to present to you the story of Edward and Erin. But it is a REMAKE. With new details and now that I have improved my writing a bit. I hope you like it. 


Yes, I know. Long stories don't usually work here. But I wanted this story better.)

**Out of Continuity: Lair of the Society**

The basement/clinic was completely silent, only disturbed by the occasional beeping of one of the Medical Teams. Suddenly the 5 members of the society entered, all carrying Erin, who was in a very weak state of health, black marks came out of her mouth, and spread across her skin.

Elizabeth: Let's put her on the stretcher, carefully... 

They placed her on her bed, while they hooked her up to monitors to view her vital signs. Which were at worryingly low levels. The 5 members left all their keys on top of Edward's desk. Next to a small black device similar to a wristwatch.

Eechiro: Where the hell did one of the legionaries come from? 

Eric: No idea, she took advantage of the fact that we were distracted by the mobsters and appeared from behind. 

Elizabeth: We have more important issues right now. Her signs are stable but they are declining at a worrying speed, we have to find a way to cure her...

Edward moves away a little to lean against one of the laboratory counters. His mind was still racing, Erin's voice began to hit his psyche. Repeating her name over and over again. Until his mind decided to take him to THAT night. He could feel like Erin was hugging him...

""P-please... help me‚Ä¶""

His pupils shrank, turning into small black dots. His arms had the reflex of trying to hug the air in front of him. The only thing that could bring him back to reality was Eechiro's clicking noises. Which was in front of him, trying to get his attention, while he repeated his name.

‚ÄúEdward! Edward! Richter!‚Äù Eechiro gave up and returned to the rest of the society, who were surrounding Erin ‚ÄúNothing! He's in Shock, I can't get him out of there!""

Edelgard: ‚ÄúLeave him, we have to do something soon! If we don't find a way to cure her, she's going to *die*""

Those last words gave Edward chills, but also the boost he needed to start moving. Without saying a single word, he approached his desk and took 5 keys next to the strange clock. After this, he began to leave the basement. While he put the watch on his wrist.

‚Äú*Sigh* Okay, we need a plan to confront the detective and get into that base. Any ideas, Edward...?‚Äù Eric noticed that Edward was leaving the basement, and after a quick glance he also saw that he had taken the keys. ""Damn! Stop him!""

The four members of the society followed Edward who walked determinedly towards the door to leave the House. Just a few meters away, Elizabeth and Eechiro began to pull his arms. While Edelgard held him by the back of the neck.

Eechiro: ‚ÄúYou're not getting away that easy! 

Edward quickly crouched and performed a roundhouse kick to knock down the three who were trying to pin him down. Eric placed himself between Edward and the door to prevent him from leaving.

Eric: ‚ÄúEdward, No! We need a plan!"" He said as he held on to the door frame to prevent Edward from pushing him.

‚ÄúROBBINSON, I KNOW YOU HAVE GOOD INTENTION. BUT I ASK YOU TO GET OUT OF THE WAY‚Äù Edward said as he looked at the floor. Eric remained immovable in place.

‚ÄúI can't do that Edward, I know you're angry. But going like this is‚Ä¶‚Äù Eric‚Äôs words faltered as Edward placed a firm hand on his shoulder, locking eyes with him. Eric stared into the forensic examiner‚Äôs eyes‚Äînot with anger, but with a mixture of fear and resolve. For the first time, Edward's expression broke through its usual indifference, revealing deep concern. That look was all Eric needed to make his decision. He stepped aside, allowing Edward to pass. Edward gave him a single nod before heading out the door. As soon as Elizabeth, Edelgard, and Eechiro stood up, they went straight to confront Eric.

Eechiro: ‚Äú""What the hell was that? Have you gone crazy!? You let him leave with all the keys!"" 

Elizabeth: ‚ÄúHe didn't take all‚Ä¶ he lefts Erin's key. Although Eechiro is right, what were you thinking? Did you let him go alone to face an army?""

Eric: ‚ÄúYou didn't see it‚Ä¶ that look was relentless. I'm afraid of what will happen...""

Edelgard: ‚ÄúIf you were afraid, why did you let him go?‚Äù

Eric: ‚ÄúI'm not worried about Edward... I'm worried about anyone who tries to stop him. But that‚Äôs not our main concern right now. We need to focus on keeping her alive. Come on, let's move!‚Äù

**Universe 18-24-53: Lair of the Steelwater.**

Edward arrived at the outskirts of a bar, from outside he could see multiple men sitting at the tables. Most of them had baseball bats or brass knuckles. At the centre table there were four men playing poker. After a few seconds of thinking, he decided to go inside.

‚ÄúLook and cry gentlemen, I have Full House,‚Äù said a man as he slammed the table hard. Another responded to him, as he revealed his cards, ‚ÄúVery interesting, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

""What!? An R-Royal straight!? ‚ÄúThat's impossible, you bastard,‚Äù said the first, while he looked at his partner's letters in astonishment. The lucky gangster was about to say something, until suddenly, Edward grabbed his sleeve, causing multiple hidden cards to fall out.

The gangster was surprised by the presence of Edward standing next to them. ""Where the hell did it come from?"" Wait‚Ä¶ you cheated!?‚Äù The gangster replied, now addressing his partner.

‚ÄúO-Of course not‚Ä¶ and also who the hell is this blue-haired?‚Äù Said the other man who was still sitting. A dead silence was maintained until multiple glasses were heard breaking. When Edward turned around he saw a man at another table, with the bat in his hand. He had dropped his beer on the floor in shock. ‚ÄúIdiots! That blue-haired is one of those multiverse travellers! The Forensic Killer! You let the enemy in!

""What!?"" The Full House man lunged at Edward, who simply dodged him. Placing his leg to cause the gangster to fall to the ground, the man's forehead collided with one of the wooden chairs. The other men launched themselves at Edward, who limited himself to Dodge, and responded to them with the furniture of the place. He attacked them with chairs, plates. Even with the same poker cards. ‚ÄúWhy don't you die!?‚Äù It was probably the phrase that was repeated the most in that fight.

When there were only two men left, they both decided to distance themselves from Edward, and tried to go to the back of the bar. Quickly, Edward took out a pair of sharp metal scissors from his pocket and threw them hard, aiming for the head of one of the men. Which remained nailed to the wall next to the door, while his companion managed to escape. Edward followed at a fast pace, but without running, maintaining unwavering composure. Which only generated more fear in the man who ran.

Edward followed the man to some underground warehouses. The contrast with the bar was clear, while the first looked like a stereotypical 80s movie, this was more like an apocalypse bunker. The man continued running down the long hallway, until he reached a huge room at the end. Due to the distance he had managed to get from the coroner. He had time to activate the Security system. Edward saw three huge metal doors close between him and the man. At this, Edward said nothing. He just approached and tapped the metal plate in front of him, after which he took out of his pocket one of the keys that he had taken from the base. It had a drawing of a dragon. And small burn marks. Edward took the key and inserted it into a small slot in the device on his wrist, suddenly a flash of orange light invaded the tunnel‚Ä¶

On the other side of the door the Gangster is celebrating ‚Äî ‚ÄúLet's see how you get through that, Four Eyes!‚Äù Until he felt 2 presence behind him ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù The man turned around to see his boss, a man in a beige suit, with his hair combed back with gel. Next to him was a woman with red hair and green eyes. She dressed in a black trench coat, shirt and black pants.

""Boss! Miss Octavia! ‚ÄúIs the killer, he is here, and he eliminated everyone in the bar!‚Äù The man said as his legs trembled. The boss hardly flinched. While the woman only managed to murmur a phrase, ‚ÄúLook how it goes... Long time no see, Richter."" 

The man guided his boss and the redhead to a screen, which showed the security camera in the hallway. ‚ÄúYou don't need to worry anyway, there are three metal doors between him and us. Look‚Ä¶ there is no way he can pass- WHAT?‚Äù

The three of them were stunned. The metal on the doors was melting. Edward, dressed in a black and orange kimono, shooting a burst of fire. Making a circle to melt the door. The boss rushed towards his minion, holding him by the shoulders. ‚ÄúYou told me he was the coroner, not the fire master!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's the coroner, I don't have the slightest idea how he's throwing fire.‚Äù The boss released his minion and approached the redhead. ‚ÄúListen to me, Octavia. You told me that if he eliminated one of those crazy people, The Guardians would fulfil a wish of mine. But you didn't tell me that they would come to try to destroy me.‚Äù The woman broke her silence and said, ‚ÄúCalm down, honey. Our pact still stands. The guardians will fulfil your greatest wish. You have my word as a Detective.‚Äù The redhead said as she put her hand on his shoulder.

""Boss! He already went through 2 of the doors! Look‚Äù The henchman shouted at his boss, while he pointed at the door that was turning increasingly reddish. The boss removed Octavia's hand from his shoulder. ‚ÄúQuickly, you lazy bunch, everyone pointing at the door.‚Äù all the soldiers pointed directly towards the door. ‚ÄúI want anyone who walks through that door with more holes than a damn sieve.‚Äù

Multiple men stood at a safe distance from the melting door. Everyone was waiting for what was about to happen. The sound of the flame on the other side of the door invaded the environment, until suddenly... Ceased. Causing chills to almost all the people present there. A yellow glow could be seen from under the door that was melting‚Ä¶

The silence was interrupted by the sudden ejection of the door, which was thrown directly towards the soldiers in front. A large amount of smoke came out of the hole that was left. And a couple of yellow dots lit up. Edward ran out of the smoke, wearing a black trench coat, the inside of which shone bright yellow. In his face there was a pair of Goggles, also yellow, which emitted an intense light.

""There is! Shoot him!‚Äù Tragliatore shouted loudly, at the same time that Octavia dragged him towards a door to get him away from the shooting. The henchmen fired volleys of bullets at Edward, who was blocking the shots with Edelgard's trench coat.

Edward tackled one of the men and took cover behind some wooden boxes. He took the gun from his anklet, knocked out the guard next to him and took his gun from him. To start responding to shots. Taking advantage of the lens aiming system. After several minutes, Edward realized that he needed to increase speed... He removed the key that was inserted into the device. Which had the symbol of a Sniper sight, I inserted another one that had the symbol of skates.

After this, he threw his pistol into the air, while a green light enveloped him. The gangsters were perplexed, watching as the gun transformed into a UZI with neon green markings. They were even more perplexed, when Edward jumped over the box... Dressed in a black one-piece suit, with silver lines. In large white letters it was written ""Ritcher"" and a number 3 in the back.

Edward caught the UZI out of the air, and it clicked on his heels. The white boot soles began to glow, and he levitated a few centimetres from the floor. The next thing the gangsters saw was this blue-haired boy attacking them with the UZI.

‚ÄúQuickly, Darling. Over here!‚Äù She told Octavia to the mafia leader, As she dragged him through one of the doors, and she kept crouched down so as not to be seen.

Edward continued to dodge bullets while he in turn returned fire. Then he quickly positioned himself in the centre of the room, and began to spin on its axis at high speed, while he continued shooting with the UZI and one of the gangsters' SMG. Generating a storm of bullets, which filled the room. When he stopped, Edward realized that he had made holes in all the walls, covers and enemies in the place. He began to walk towards the hallway that Tragliatore left down. With all the calm in the world, he removed the key from the device, and placed a different one with the symbol of an Oxygen mask and a Sickle.

‚ÄúCome in! Come in! Quick!"" Octavia shouted at Tragliatore, while holding the door of a small laboratory, which had a small window with a curtain, inside was another of the henchmen, dressed in a white coat. After entering, Octavia's attention was quickly caught by a shelf with some books. Tragliatore watched as his protector began to search the bookshelf. ‚ÄúWhat's happening, boss? I heard a lot of gunshots and-‚Äù Quickly, the scientist's words were interrupted by the screams of their leader. ‚ÄúThat doesn't matter now! We are under attack, scan the bunker. I want to see how many of my men are still alive!‚Äù The henchman typed something on a nearby computer. While Tragliatore was still confused by what Octavia was doing. He was about to ask her, when his employee's surprised moan distracted him. ‚ÄúBo-boss, there are only four living beings left in the Building‚Ä¶‚Äù Tragliatore raised his hands to his face, passing them all over his face, while he let out a long sigh through his mouth.

‚ÄúOkay, okay, it's manageable, it's manageable‚Ä¶ Octavia, we need a plan, can you think of it‚Ä¶ Octavia!?‚Äù The gangster was surprised when he saw the red-haired girl, with a book from which a white glow came out. And a white circle surrounded her. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, Honey.,but our deal is going to have to end here‚Ä¶‚Äù When Tragliatore tried to stop her, he realized that he couldn't get through the circle. ‚ÄúThis was not what was agreed upon, you said that The Guardians were going to fulfil my wish‚Ä¶‚Äù Octavia tore the pages from the book, and held them up. ‚ÄúI told you that they were going to grant your wish‚Ä¶‚Äù She I release the torn pages, which began to orbit her. ‚ÄúIf you survived‚Ä¶‚Äù Tragliatore was about to reply, until his minion shouted at him, with a tone of perennial terror in his voice. ""MISTER! ‚Äúhe's coming down the hallway, he's coming this way.‚Äù Tragliatore's shock was evident in his eyes. And when he turned around to look to Octavia for a solution, he saw that she had disappeared, and the circle on the floor was on fire.

The scientist quickly approached Tragliatore, holding him by the shoulders, his body aligned with the door. On the other side of which footsteps could be heard in the distance. ‚ÄúWhat do we do now, boss? There are only the two of us left, I don't want to die! My notes are still on the table, if he finds out that I designed that poison, I don't know what he'll do to me!‚Äù Tragliatore quickly slapped the soldier away from him. ‚ÄúWe're not going to give up, listen this is what we're going to-‚Äù

Before Tragliatore could finish the sentence, a metal object came flying through the door window. The sickle hit the scientist directly and stuck into the wall. Blood began to drip from the inert body. Tragliatore recoiled in shock, blood had splattered on his face.

The bottom of the Sickle opened and a small stream of water came out, which floated forming a hand. Which I grab the sickle and take it out of the wall. Causing the man to fall to the floor, Tragliatore watched in shock as the hand stopped in front of the door and slammed hard against the handle. Causing the door to open.

Edward entered through the door, dressed in a black jacket with grey sleeves, accompanied by black neoprene pants. The footsteps of his boots broke the silence of the room like thunder in the night. His face was covered by a hood, accompanied by a black oxygen mask. Tragliatore tried to pull the gun from him, but was quickly restrained by Edward. Which he held against the wall.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you want? If you're going to kill me, do it now!"" Tragliatore tried to say with the most threatening tone he could. Edward remained silent, taking one of his scissors out of his pocket, beginning to run it across the neck of the mafia leader. ""Wait! Wait! You want money? ‚ÄúI can give you money.‚Äù At the offer, Edward stuck the scissors into Tragliatore's leg. Causing blood to flow out, along with a gasp of pain ‚ÄúAgh!!‚Ä¶ Okay, Okay, no money. What do you want?""

Edward took out the syringe with a black liquid from his pocket. And he shook it in front of him. ""The poison? Do you want to know how the poison is made? What makes you think I would tell you?‚Äù Tragliatore said, finishing his sentence by spitting at Edward. Which was Stoic, took another scissors from his pocket, and stuck it in Tragliatore's hand. Leaving it nailed to the wall. The scream of pain was even louder. ‚ÄúUgh! In the table! In the notebook on the table!‚Äù Edward leave tragliatore, letting the scissors holding him, while he went straight to what he had come for. He took the leather-bound notebook, and opened it to the page that was marked with a red ribbon. On the same page, the process with which the poison had been made was detailed.

After seeing this, Edward began to walk towards the exit door. A white glow enveloped him and his clothes returned to his usual trench coat. Tragliatore couldn't contain his frustration and shouted at Edward, ‚ÄúReally? You entered my base, you killed all my staff, that's why? All this for that Bea-‚Äù Before he could finish the sentence, Edward turned on his heel. Throwing a pair of scissors directly at Tragliatore's forehead. The scissors remained stuck in the wall. Leaving a hole in Tragliatore's face. ‚ÄúDON'T YOU DARE TALK BADLY ABOUT HER IN MY PRESENCE, EVER!"" After this, Edward adjusts his bangs, and begins to walk out of the underground base. Willing to achieve it.

***Out of Continuity: Lair of the Society / Three days later‚Ä¶***

Edward is sitting next to Erin's stretcher, his brain racing with different ideas. ""What if the dosage is wrong? What if I misread the notes? What if I made a mistake, what if...""

A slap on the back from Elizabeth brought him back to reality. The green-haired girl was bringing him a cup of coffee. ""You need to slow down..."" The skater set the coffee down on a table and approached Erin. ""Getting nervous will only make you anxious and not think clearly.""

""What makes you think I'm nervous? Rider..."" Edward tried to hide his concern, as he took a sip from the cup. Although Elizabeth quickly retorted, ""Because I know what it's like to see your friends in a coma, and you also move your leg at a speed that makes you look like a drummer...""

The girl's little joke annoyed Edward who quickly stood up.  ""What the hell did you come for? If it was for coffee, thank you. If it was for news, there isn't any. Now get out of my lab.""

Elizabeth shrugged her shoulders. ""I just wanted to check on you two. I'm leaving.""
The green-haired girl walked to the door and stopped in the doorway. ""You know, they say people in a coma can still hear. Maybe you should talk to her to calm her down. And to calm yourself down..."" The girl left, leaving Edward and Erin alone. 

The blue-haired boy stared at the cat-eared girl. The word ""recourage"" echoed in his brain. He slowly sat down next to the bed and took her hand.

""Hi Ro... Erin. I know we've known each other for a long time and I haven't shown much reciprocation to your feelings... but I need you to wake up.

Because you... gave meaning to my life. When I thought everyone was fake and selfish, you showed me something more. In that hug in the storm, you showed me the real you... You let me see the To the scared and pure-hearted girl. For the first time in my life, I felt a beautiful warmth.

That's why I need you to wake up, because there's no one more important to me in my life. You look at me like I'm the best man in the entire multiverse, and that's far from the truth. But I strive, day by day, to be worthy of at least a little of that love. And I swear... *Sniff* To you, to the sky, and to the stars... That you will always be... the most important thing in my life... Please, come back to me.""

The young man ends up breaking down, clinging to the only thing that makes him feel safe.

***Out of Continuity: Lair of the Society / four days later‚Ä¶***

Erin woke up on the stretcher, feeling the numbness of multiple days, her eyes slowly opening as her senses began to return. She looked around her, recognizing the medical equipment and monitors that were still beeping softly. She sat up on the bed with some effort, and her gaze fell on Edward, who was sitting next to her.

Edward was completely disheveled, with deep circles under his eyes that marked his tired face. He tapped his foot on the floor at high speed, clearly nervous. Next to him, the table was littered with a lot of empty coffee cups.

""Edward?"" Erin asked in a weak voice. Edward looked up quickly, his eyes filled with a mix of surprise and relief. Realizing that he hadn't imagined the sound of Erin's voice, he jumped up and hugged her with strength.

""You are fine!"" he exclaimed, he words filled with emotion. Edward moved away from her a little, holding Erin's face with her hands under her cheeks.

""Yeah...I'm fine,"" Erin responded, still a little disoriented. Then she noticed the black marks under Edward's eyes and frowned in concern. ""My God...Edward, your eyes... are you okay?""

Edward couldn't help but let out a small laugh. ""You wake up from a coma, and the first thing you ask me is if I'm okay?"" After that, Edward hugged her again, resting his jaw on top of her head. Erin just enjoyed the hug, feeling the warm and security that he gave her.

Suddenly, she felt drops falling on her head. Erin looked up and saw the tears falling from Edward's eyes. ""Edward... What's going on?"" she asked in a soft voice.

Edward grabbed her chin again and brought her face closer to his, causing Erin to blush. ""What is going on?"" Edward moved forward, planting a kiss on Erin's lips. The shock to Erin's mind was brutal, but soon she began to enjoy it. After several minutes, Edward broke the kiss and looked at Erin with a look he'd never had before. ""***That*** is what going on..."" Edward said softly, hugging her again.

 ""I Love you, Erin""

Full article (used google translate so some words are a bit off)

**Hardung on second career: ‚ÄúI want to keep the door open‚Äù.**

Damian Hardung became known through the Vox series ‚ÄúClub der roten B√§nder‚Äù. This series made him famous overnight:¬†Damian Hardung¬†was the star of ‚ÄúClub der roten B√§nder‚Äù (¬†[Vox](https://archive.is/o/3bnXh/https://www.morgenpost.de/kultur/tv-streaming/vox/)¬†) in 2015. In the three seasons of the series ‚ÄúHow to Sell Drugs Online (Fast)‚Äù on Netflix, he played the role of Daniel Riffert since 2019. In 2024, he took on the male lead in the Prime Video series ‚ÄúMaxton Hall - The World Between Us‚Äù. He can now be seen in the vampire series ‚ÄúLove Sucks‚Äù (from October 11,¬†[ZDF online](https://archive.is/o/3bnXh/https://www.morgenpost.de/kultur/tv-streaming/zdf/)¬†). But the 26-year-old¬†[actor](https://archive.is/o/3bnXh/https://www.morgenpost.de/panorama/schauspieler/)¬†refuses to pigeonhole the industry and prefers to attend urology lectures as a student. 

Q:There's a lot going on in your life at the moment. Aside from ""Love Sucks"", your hit series ""Maxton Hall"" is continuing and now you're also shooting your first international production...¬†

Damian Hardung:¬†Yes, I am also looking forward to slowing down.



Q: It's certainly not that easy to achieve.

Hardung:¬†Ideally, I find time for that between projects. Or I just take the bull by the horns: I simply process the lack of slowing down in my role. That is the privilege of this often strange¬†[job](https://archive.is/o/3bnXh/https://www.morgenpost.de/ratgeber-wissen/beruf/)¬†, working on issues that also concern you in your private life. My current role has a ""Do More"" tattoo as a reminder and is learning to say ""no"". I can perhaps learn something from that. And for me it is probably less about slowing down than about a change of rhythm, the switch from output to new input.

Hardung:¬†For example, on the last two days of my urology internship. During a partial bladder resection, I get different input than when I'm on set.¬†

Q:That's why he sometimes doubts his acting career. You mentioned your medical studies. Would it be conceivable that you would give up acting for a career as a doctor?¬†

Hardung:¬†Definitely. In acting, I always come to points where I think to myself: What am I doing here? It helps to think that when I'm 30, I can say: ""Thank you, it was nice. I've done this for 20 years. Now it's time for something else."" I definitely want to keep that door open for myself.¬†

Q:In ‚ÄúLove Sucks‚Äù the question is asked: ‚ÄúIs this your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreal life?‚Äù What is yours?¬†

Hardung:¬†On my current journey from role to role, I often ask myself: Where does fiction begin and where does reality end? I consciously look for moments where you get so deeply into a role that the fiction feels like reality. But for me, real life takes place beyond all roles, including the role of Damian Hardung.¬†

Q: To put it another way: When do you feel authentic?¬†

Hardung:¬†There are many words that try to describe exactly that, whether in the moment of resonance according to Hartmut Rosa \[German sociologist and political scientist ‚Äì editor's note\] or in the experience of the sense of coherence according to Antonovsky \[Israeli-American sociologist ‚Äì editor's note\]. Ultimately, I always feel authentic when my inner self is in harmony with the outside world. When I notice that I am exactly right where I am right now.¬†You can also feel good when you enjoy yourself. 

Q:Since the series is set heavily in the nightlife scene, do you have the time to indulge in such things or are you completely occupied with all your activities?

Hardung:¬†I would say that I can indulge in hedonism¬†¬†even when doing sports or drinking my¬†[morning coffee .](https://archive.is/o/3bnXh/https://www.morgenpost.de/ratgeber/article238568651/kaffee-tassen-darm-expertin-wirkung-effekt-toilette-gesundheit.html)

Q: Does that mean you don't have to go to clubs and bars anymore?¬†

Hardung:¬†Epicureanism is not just excess in nightlife, although that is certainly a striking manifestation. It can be excess in all areas that provide physical pleasure. A round of Spikeball can also have something extremely hedonistic about it.¬†

Q: That is why Damian Hardung does not believe in overly intellectual life planning. You are studying medicine, you were a footballer, and in the interview you quote technical terms from thinkers and scientists. Do you sometimes feel under-challenged by life?¬†

Hardung:¬†No, I definitely don't have the feeling that life doesn't offer me enough or doesn't challenge me enough. I can say that I can't say that at all. I'm incredibly happy that so much is thrown my way. I have to look at what is suitable for me and what has nothing to do with me at all.¬†

Q: International film projects such as the romantic drama ‚ÄúInto The Deep Blue‚Äù have now been added to your activities. Are you consciously striving for a global career or are you just taking it easy?¬†

Hardung:¬†I never had a plan and there will never be a five-year plan. Maybe after the next project I'll say: ""Guys, that was nice, but I need something different now."" I just want to be open to feel inside myself instead of saying in an overly intellectual way: ""Yes, but I still wanted to do this and that in America."" I don't want to approach my job like that.¬†

However, two days ago I had a strong coffee which triggered one of the strongest panic attacks I've ever experienced. Today I almost had another one, but it was milder.

I am nuyorican, and I've visited the island a few times for family reunions, relaxing getaways, and rainforest adventures. This time, I brought my boyfriend for the first time. Since it was his first time, we did quite a few touristy activities, but it was still lots of fun, and we had some less touristy food. I decided this would be a good opportunity to share my itinerary and reviews in case anyone's looking to visit the island soon.

**Duration**  
5 nights, 6 days (Monday - Saturday)

**Time of Year**  
October

I know lots of travelers have concerns about traveling to the Caribbean in October, since hurricane season is from June to November. But the risk was worth the reward. I would recommend purchasing insurance, in case you have to reschedule your trip due to any potential storms if you plan to travel at this time of year (especially between July and September).

We are a very low-key couple. We don't love to party, and we tend to be early risers. If you're into relaxing low-key vacations, then this itinerary may be for you. If you love a party vibe, maybe skip to the reviews below :)

**The Hotel**

We stayed at [The Fairmont El San Juan](https://www.elsanjuanhotel.com/) in Isla Verde. This hotel is a middle ground as far as price goes, and it is extremely convenience, since it's about a 10 minute Uber ride from SJU airport, and 15-20 minutes into Old San Juan. This historic hotel was opened in 1958 and the lobby features an old world feel with dark wood accents, stunning design features, and a regal feel. It is a tad too dark in the daytime, but it creates a whole different atmosphere at night. While children are allowed at this hotel, you aren't likely to see too many of them due to the more adult party vibe of the hotel.

*Hotel Amenities*

* Large pool area with multiple pools, hot tubs, and an 18+ only pool
* Direct beach access
* Foxwoods Casino
* Live Music on Mondays, along with multiple social events in the lobby throughout the week
* Brava nightclub
* Multiple restaurants and bars
* Shopping area with shops, more restaurants, and Starbucks

Conclusion: If you're a party person, this hotel is perfect! It may not be the right hotel for you if you're looking for a chill vibe. For something more relaxed, I'd recommend the hotel next door, The Royal Sonesta.

**The Restaurants**

* **Casita Miramar (7.4/10):** Located in San Juan, this restaurant is one of two owned by the same person. Casita Blanca features more traditional Puerto Rican food (think lunchtime). Casita Miramar is Casita Blanca's older, more sophisticated sibling, with traditional flavors being reworked for an upscale crowd. The views are beautiful, and the neighborhood is quiet. I would recommend getting a reservation if you plane to dine on a weekend. Also, GET THE TRES LECHES CAKE. You will not be disappointed.
   * 605 Av. Miramar, San Juan, 00907, Puerto Rico
* **Kaffe Haus (8.6/10):** This is probably my favorite breakfast spot in Old San Juan. The decor is really cute and hip, and the coffee is delicious! I love a sweet breakfast, but their savory breakfasts are to die for. If you'll be in OSJ, definitely try this cafe out.
   * 311 C. Tetu√°n, San Juan, 00901, Puerto Rico
* **Deaverdura (7.9/10):** I like hitting this spot for lunch. While it's more touristy, it is far from a trap. The flavors are quite traditional, and you get a lot of food for a little bit of money. If you're looking to dip your toe into Puerto Rican cuisine, this restaurant has a sampler plate, which comes on a really cute wooden cheese board in the shape of PR. This is a 10/10 lunch spot in my book! Be prepared to wait a bit since it's a small space.
   * 200 Sol St, San Juan, 00901, Puerto Rico
* **Il Sole (5.7/10):** This Italian restaurant is located in the Fairmont. Not only is convenient, but the pizza is pretty good! It's expensive, as hotel food is, but it's a great option for an easier night in the hotel after a long day of activity. I wouldn't visit this restaurant if I wasn't staying at The Fairmont, but I'd skip Ca√±a (the hotel restaurant) and go here if I was.
   * 6063 Isla Verde Avenue Carolina, Puerto Rico 00979
* **Panaderia las Canarias (7.9/10):** I didn't have a chance to have lunch here, so I can only rate it based on breakfast, but if I had to guess, their lunch is pretty good. Their breakfast platters are not only huge, but they are so delicious! The breakfast quesadilla with bacon is a must-have if you like a savory breakfast. If you're more of a sweet breakfast kind of person, their pancakes are fresh and fluffy. What really impressed me was their fresh squeezed, pulp free orange juice. It was delicious! If I have a chance to stay nearby again, I would go for lunch one day. I bet their pastelillos and sorullitos are good.
   * 6700, Calle Marginal, Carolina, 00979, Puerto Rico
* **Bacaro (9.2/10):** This is by far the best Italian restaurant I've ever had. It's a bit of a hidden gem in Old San Juan, but once you step inside, you're greeted by a cozy atmosphere that blends classic OSJ style with Italian decor. The place is a bit small, and I'd recommend a reservation, regardless of the day of the week. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and it wasn't too salty, too bland, over or under seasoned. It was just perfect! It is no frills and a great place to escape into a quiet scene in the city. 
   * 152 C. de la Cruz, San Juan, 00901, Puerto Rico

**The Attractions**

* **El Morro**: There are actually two forts on the island. The larger and more popular of the two is[ Castillo San Felipe del Morro](https://carabalirainforestpark.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwmaO4BhAhEiwA5p4YL-nPSeYq1ppxUMozrPojDkuQZYqHDyvUqpwOIlbxdCoyAqhCpknQpBoC75AQAvD_BwE). This is a must see if you'll be in or around San Juan. Not only are the views stunning, but it's a great way to learn about the history of the island. Admission is $10, and this grants you admission all day to both forts. If you visit Castillo San Felipe del Morro, I would say you can skip Castillo San Cristobal. The park is gorgeous and well maintained, but be aware of the sun. There is no A/C and no shade. You will burn or overheat very easily, so bring lots of water, and be mindful of the heat. Heat exhaustion is no joke. 
* **Old San Juan:** This part of the city is absolutely stunning. It's very historical, and every street is lined with colorful townhomes and shops. If you love cats, keep your eyes peeled on the outskirts of the city. There are tons of stray cats in Puerto Rico.
* **Carabali Rainforest Park:** [This park](https://carabalirainforestpark.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwmaO4BhAhEiwA5p4YL-nPSeYq1ppxUMozrPojDkuQZYqHDyvUqpwOIlbxdCoyAqhCpknQpBoC75AQAvD_BwE) is about a 30-40 minute drive from San Juan, so I'd recommend renting a car for the day to get here. This 600-acre farmland in the foothills of El Yunque rainforest boasts activities like horseback riding, ATVs, UTVs, and go-karting. We found it last minute and decided to do a horseback riding tour. This was a highlight of my trip. I wouldn't say it was a replacement for a hike through the rainforest, but if you're looking for something less strenuous and time consuming, this is a good option. I loved being able to experience nature on horseback. The staff assign you a horse based on weight, and the horses are very well trained and sweet. You're provided with a helmet, and I would recommend wearing long pants. We stopped at the restaurant on-site for lunch and had a filling meal for just $40. It was a great way to get away from the city for the morning, and we made it back to the hotel in time for a dip in the pool before dinner. ",1,1728700120.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,1.0,False

According to nutritionists, great supplements boost metabolism, suppress appetite, and shed fat. If their opinions are anything to go by, here are the top 10 weight loss supplements recommended by experts to try in 2024: 

[**PhenQ exceeded my expectations! It curbed my appetite and gave me the energy I needed to stick to my workout**](https://www.wb22trk.com/XR12ZC/BP658/)

1. PhenQ  
  
PhenQ is one of the most popular all-in-one solutions to target different aspects of weight loss: fat burning, appetite reduction, and prevention of new fat cells. With the blend of natural ingredients such as Capsimax Powder combined with caffeine, it instantly becomes a favorite-the effectiveness for long-term results is just a bonus. 2. Zotrim  
  
Zotrim has proved to be a reliable herbal appetite suppressant, which would just be great for anyone who wants to eat a bit less throughout the day. Made from yerba mat√©, guarana, and damiana, this particular herbal-based appetite suppressant regulates hunger and energizes the body for a longer period of time.  
3. Leanbean  
  
Leanbean is intended for women only; it combines appetite suppressants with facilities of boosting metabolism. Glucomannan, a fiber from nature that promotes satiety, helps you stick to calorie restriction with much ease.  
4. Garcinia Cambogia Extract  
  
Garcinia Cambogia is known for its hydroxycitric acid active ingredient, believed to impede fat production and affect appetite. Many nutritionists recommend it to people searching for a natural fat-blocking solution.  
5. Extract of Green Tea  
  
Rich in antioxidants, green tea extract has been proven to enhance the burning of fat, particularly during exercise. It finds a place in most weight loss programs due to its metabolism-enhancing properties and enhancement of fat oxidation.  
6. Hydroxycut  
  
Hydroxycut is a well-known brand name within the arena of weight loss. It contains a blend of caffeine, green coffee extract, and other plant extracts. What it does is give you an energy boost and help burn more fat effectively in the body.  
7. Glucomannan  
  
As a natural fiber extracted from the root of the konjac plant, glucomannan expands in your stomach, which tends to make you feel fuller longer. This supplement joins my top recommendations for appetite suppression and support for a calorie deficit.  
8. CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid)  
  
CLA is a naturally occurring fatty acid usually sourced from meat and dairy products. It's considered great for reducing body fat while improving the tone of the muscles, which is why it's one of the most used food additives when building lean body mass through weight loss. 9. Caffeine  
  
A classic fat burner, caffeine is known for boosting your metabolism and triggering the oxidation of fat. The energy- and performance-boosting action makes many weight loss supplements feature it as a main ingredient, making it easier for one to stay active. 10. Apple Cider Vinegar  
  
Also, apple cider vinegar has been related to several benefits to health, such as weight loss. It contributes to appetite suppression, which increases metabolism and reduces fat storage. Nutritionists usually recommend the product as a natural product that can complement one's health through a healthy diet.

Choosing the right supplement will accelerate your journey of weight loss.

Hey fellow wanderers! üåç I'm Derek, aka u/solopassions, and I'm here to spill the tea (or should I say, the travel coffee?) on the utterly manic, life-changing experience of solo travel. üòé‚úàÔ∏è

Ever found yourself on a hummus-fueled binge while Googling ""solo travel adventures"" at 3 AM? No? Just me? Okay, moving on... üòÖ

Picture this: a wide-eyed, map-clutching me, plopped in the middle of Barcelona, decoding the mystery of where the heck I was (hint: not in front of that famous Sagrada Familia ‚Äì thanks, Google Maps!).

**Unique Experiences & Challenges:**
- **Fine Dining for One**: Ever had a table for one at a fancy restaurant? Yes, you will awkwardly exchange glances with romantic couples, and yes, the waiter will ask twice if you're expecting someone. Spoiler: You're totally gonna flaunt your independence like it's nobody's business! üçΩÔ∏è
  
- **Lost in Translation**: When my five-star attempt at ordering coffee in Paris turned into accidentally purchasing... directions to the Eiffel Tower. Who knew ""caf√©"" and ""caf√© au lait"" could be so tricky? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚òï

**Solo Travel Revelation (aka Personal Growth)**:
- I'd always thought ""personal growth"" was one of those clich√© stretch-your-yoga-mat phrases. But solo travel showed me that I could rock decisions like a pro ‚Äì like cutting through hidden alleys in Rome or finding THAT non-touristy tango club in Buenos Aires.

Pro-tip: Solo travel upgrades your internal GPS and offers a crash course in ""Trust Your Gut 101."" üéØ

**Derek's Solo Travel Tips**:
- **Say Yes to New**: Embrace the unexpected ‚Äì whether it's that cooking class in Florence or karaoke in a Tokyo dive bar. They‚Äôll become your golden stories. üé§üé∂

- **Fear is Part of the Journey**: Feel the fear and do it anyway... or as I like to call it, ‚ÄúAdventuring with Palpitations‚Äù (not as catchy, but you get the drift).

- **Solo Selfies are Unapologetically Epic**: A selfie stick or a trusty rock-ledge, and boom, your new Instagram-worthy shot. #nofilternoneedsubtle #theselfielife üì∏

Remember, dear friends, sometimes the best company is yourself. Much like our favorite Drifter Hotel in New Orleans, the magic of solo travel lies in weaving together history, surprise, and a dash of that drifter ethos. It's not just about discovering places, it's about discovering YOU in those places.

Embark on YOUR solo escapade and who knows? Maybe we'll bump into each other, wielding maps and coffee, living our best self-discovery dreams!

Happy travels! üöÄüí´

1g1q8q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gravesdisease/comments/1g1q8q9/my_story_and_how_im_cured_from_graves/,My story and how I'm cured from Graves.,"In 2020, when Covid hit, I started experiencing some serious health issues‚Äîheart palpitations, hand tremors, light sensitivity, painful joints, fatigue, and insomnia. Initially, I worried it was heart problems, but after visiting a doctor and running tests, everything came back negative. He suggested a thyroid issue, so I consulted three endocrinologists. One did an ultrasound and said my thyroid was self-destructing and recommended a thyroidectomy. Confused by the conflicting opinions, I‚Äôm grateful I decided against that.



Then I stumbled upon a YouTube video saying hand tremors could be linked to B1 deficiency, so I tried the supplement‚Äîand my hand shaking stopped within days. This sparked my journey into researching my health. I experienced some scary thyrotoxicosis episodes during this time, and looking back, I wish I had taken medication until I stabilized. Instead, I found a supplement called thyroid calming, along with vitamin D and magnesium. My eyes bulged and wouldn‚Äôt close during sleep, which was alarming.



Eventually, I discovered the carnivore diet, an elimination plan consisting only of meat, salt, and water. I approached it with hope and added low-dose naltrexone (LDN) to my routine. Thanks to God, my health improved, and even my eyes returned to normal. I had thought my life was over, but I was given a second chance.



I later learned certain foods triggered my autoimmune symptoms, which can vary for everyone. For me, they were eggs, grains, chocolate, and coffee. Now, at 35, I‚Äôm stronger than ever‚Äîworking out daily and feeling energized.



If you‚Äôre dealing with a similar condition, here‚Äôs my advice: avoid blue light two hours before bed, keep your room dark for sleep, aim for at least eight hours of rest, get two hours of sunlight daily (especially in the morning), don‚Äôt eat four hours before bed, eat fatty meats and broth, do some light exercise, manage stress, and communicate your struggles to those around you. It can be tough at first, but stay consistent. If I could do it, so can you!",0,1728699582.0,gravesdisease,3,0.23,False

I have always been a morning lark and still am, but I took pride that I didn't need caffeine to get myself up. I only started to drink coffee in college. I honestly don't remember why, but I got hooked. I think it was my Mom to helped me to start drinking coffee. Ever since I have become a coffee fanatic.

I now own a kalita wave and the best coffee I drink is the one I brew myself.

But I also adore everything that pairs well with coffee! Amaretto liquor is absolutely divine, and pairs fantastically with coffee. Tiramisu is an elite dessert. Finishing a big steak dinner with an espresso is divine. Kahula coffee liquor tastes pretty good too. Eating a coffee-based dessert like tiramisu while drinking any red wine is divine as well. The best beer with some coffee based notes is Guinness. I love the foaminess.

Best commercial ice cream coffee in my opinion is Haagen Daaz. Another really good coffee ice cream is Boba x Ice Cream Espresso coffee.

Sambuca is an anise based liquor is great and traditional a shot of is drinked with 3 coffee beans.

Coffee. Anise. Amaretto. Red Wine. Tiramisu. Guinness. Red meat. Kahula. Maybe even some gin. Whiskey. This is all elite.

Can anyone recommend a good cocktail with these flavor profiles?

  
Edit: I wanted to add another underrated flavor: Biscoff. And of course biscotti snacks, but biscoff pairs extraordinarily well with coffee. Of course, its made by Italians after all!",1,1728699221.0,CasualConversation,4,1.0,False
