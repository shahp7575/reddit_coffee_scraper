Then using the Breville ""The Razor"" tool, I was able to work out the minimum clearance and therefore maximum depth.

For the 54mm basket provided by Breville, I found that the weight was 20.06g for a well-known dialled in coffee. For that 18g also produced a delicious tasty beverage.

But is there a rule of thumb for the \*minimum\* amount of grounds that can reasonably be put into a basket before it gets sloppy? (

*Sorry in advance English is not my first language.*

 TL;DR: Friend acts like a bf in a fwb arrangement, don’t know what to do about our future.

We met in uni and its been 3 years since we met. Last relationship I had was kinda traumatic (he broke up w/me bc of long distance and he was the first guy I got intimate with) for me so I was reluctant to get into another relationship. I’ve been single for 3 years and I only went 4 dates to coffee shops. 

For the past few months we were kinda joking with each other platonically (or so I thought) but he said he was serious all this time and he was attracted to me. I told him I understood his moves as a joke because he was talking/hooking up with other girls and I have no interest to guys like that. I told him that I didn’t want to get into a relationship and he already knew that but he said our friendship dynamic was kinda distorted and we both wanted someone to get close with (like kissing and stuff). We stopped meeting for two months because of this issue and only talked in messages. 

Few weeks ago we met after a while and decided why not go on with this arrangement since we were both craving physical intimacy. 

The problem is I feel like he is in love with me and only agreed to be FWB because I am not interested in relationships. He knows I am a virgin (only got intimate with other stuff with ex bf) but he is confident that it will change. I have strict rules about intimacy and not comfortable with doing it. But he says it’s okay and we will see when timing is right. We setup some rules to not hookup w/other people or talk with them, or if we met someone we will stop talking immediately and go back to being friends. No dating apps or whatsoever. But ofc if we decided to find someone we will tell each other and stop this thing right away. He says that he is not interested in anyone rn and has no intention downloading dating apps. I told him I might want to meet someone if I am ready for a relationship and he was kinda hurt and got weird that I am thinking about downloading dating apps etc. He said that I can make any rules and he is fine with anything because he feels like I might stop this if I get uncomfortable. So he told me to be the decision maker for everything and he will just follow my lead (He said bc I was talking about negative scenarios of what might happen, he thought I wanted to end things with him).

He started talking more about relationship stuff and he started to messaging me more than usual (we mostly send each other funny stuff on ig and tw). He recently bought a bike and he said he wanted to get me a customized helmet only for me to use with cute stuff but I said to him he doesn’t need to spend his money on something like that just for me and he insisted for a while and eventually stopped asking for it for now. But he was kinda sad when I turned him down. He is also studying for masters program and he said that he is not going to have a relationship for that time period (for two years). 

I feel like he is trying to make me convince to be in a relationship with him in the future and thats why he is making these plans and commitments. Maybe he is hoping that we might be in a relationship if we get intimate and spend more time together but I don’t feel that way. We already agreed on to not catch feelings but I feel like he likes me romantically.

1jytnyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1jytnyn/ive_changed_my_mind_smash_weapons_are_awesome/,I’ve changed my mind; Smash weapons are awesome,"When I first played engage, I thought smash weapons were gimmicky and impractical. They were expensive, couldn’t follow up, heavy enough that they sent most characters down to doubling range for enemies, and their effects were gimmicky at best and actively unhelpful at worst. High might is always nice, but getting hit with what’s essentially Vantage++++ when used in player phase just to knock an enemy back a space felt like a complete nothing burger. So in my first playthrough, I ditched them.

But then I recently played through engage for a second time, and a certain realization was illuminated upon me by a cup of ice coffee on YouTube…

Smash weapons basically have no downsides in engage attacks.

And suddenly, it clicked.

A lot of engage attacks (Loadstar Rush, twin strike, override, Great Aether, blazing Lion) boil down to once per map nuke buttons. Enemies can’t counter attack, and you can’t double, so all that really matters is raw numbers. And smash weapons happen to have the most raw of numbers there is.

So I went out of my way to make use of them. And suddenly it all made sense. Berserker Diamant is hitting 82 goddamn physical attack with a Roy engraved Ukonvasara. 82, EIGHTY-TWO, I feel like I need to impress upon you just how big the number 82 is. I’m 90% certain that number is straight up unreachable in Fates no matter how much you forge a ridiculous berserker axe and use eugenics to make a monstrously high strength kid. That’s late game 3houses numbers. Eighty-fucking-two. If you have 60 Hp and 20 defense, pretty reasonably bulky, you’d be dead. And that’s at +1 for forges, and I don’t even have axe power or anything on that!

Do I think smash weapons would work in a game outside of engage considering just how effective emblem attacks are at making them more viable? ehh, not really? They’d make cute enemy only weapons like the GBA venim weapons I think, messing with your formation in enemy phase and giving enemies a little extra damage kick, but on the player they’re still pretty niche and gimmicky.

But in engage? Pure cinema. I’ll take 6 enemies hit by great aether for 82 physical attack with an additional +5 damage from blue skies+ and +10 from axe power 5 and a Diet Coke please, TO GO.",3,1744618209.0,fireemblem,0,1.0,False

The Place: Grand Emilia Hotel

When I checked in I was told i will be staying at the 3rd floor of the building which was fine until i was told there were no elevators. Sucks but can't do anything about it since the room has been paid for in advance. It was also already night time when i checked in and it was pouring. So up the stairs i went and checked the bath and made sure there was a tub because this is the 1 thing i am looking forward to in all of my stays. 

The tub wasn't as impressive as the one in Cebu R in Mabolo. This tub is deep but a little cramped If i stretch to my full length -I'm 5'0"". I noticed that the drain in the tub doesn't have any cover so i couldn't fill it with water. Went to dial 0 for front desk but no one was picking up. I didn't have any choice but to put my clothes back on. No one was at the counter but the security guard noticed me and he called the front desk lady. I told her there was no cover for the drain in the tub and she gave me this ""green stopper thingy"" you can see in the tub photos. 

Before I went back, I asked if 0 is the number for front desk (like in every hotel I've stayed at) but she said it's not. She then gave me a 3 digit number to dial for front desk. This got me frustrated because in other places the front desk personnel will tell you to dial 0 if you need anything but this girl didn't bother to share that info upon check in. Dumb me didn't ask and just assumed it was 0. Their room phone didn't have any instructions either. I also noticed there weren't any complimentary water in the room so i asked if there was free water and she pointed me to the water dispenser but lo and behold right beside it is a trash bin. 😱 I went back to my room to soak my frustration in the tub. 

Some of the other things I noticed in the room is the bed. The room is good for 2 people but it has a small bed. I don't know what size this is but it is small. I'm used to seeing a queen sized bed in rooms for 2 people. Like Cebu R Mabolo there were only 2 pillows on the bed too. The comforter is shorter than me so i had to remove it from being tied to the bed and use it lenghtwise.

The room has its usuals: table, chair, mirror and tv. There are no bottled water and no coffee making facility. The sleepers weren't ""hotel slippers"" but at least there was one (or two 🤭). The shower is not separate from the tub and the sink is tiny.

I was getting ready for bed and brushing my teeth when i noticed shaved hairs on the white faucet. I then wondered what else was not cleaned in the room.

It was my treat, I went their earlier and ordered food and the coffee (it was in a mug). When they arrived the food was almost ready. 

I know that his girlfriend doesn't like coffee, at all. I remevrr her saying ""smelling it make me wanna puke"" but she said it in a non serious way. She didn't say she was allergic so I thought she just didn't like coffee. She had a very weak sense of smell, so her smelling the weak scent of coffee is impossible. I don't know why though, I'm not a healthcare worker so I don't know if it was a result of infection or something, I didn't ask her either. 

She asked me what was in the mug and I said to just try it and see. She seem like a chill woman so I expected her to be disgusting but not mad. But, shockingly, she started vomiting right away, she didn't even take a second sip. It was sudden and no one knew what to do so one of our friend took her to the restroom. It didn't make sense, I don't know any allergic reaction that elicits spontaneous vomiting. I asked my friend if she was allergic, he said ""kinda, it's complicated"". He wasn't mad right away but after a couple of minutes he because mad at me. He said that im an ass. 

I meant this as a small prank, I know not to take allergies or any health issue lightly, my own girlfriend has diabetes. But my friend made me feel that I don't care at all. They didn't even came back to set. He went to the restroom and they both left.

Here is my first 5 books finished roundup for this years bingo card.  Im going for a full hardmode card like i did last year and this year i want to make a concerted effort to fully review and rate each book on the subreddit.  Normally im 100% a grimdark edgy boi but ive really been trying to branch out and read as much from as many different genres and styles as I can so i can experience as much different fantasy as I possibly can

**High Fashion****:** Read a book where clothing/fashion or fiber arts are important to the plot. This can be a crafty main character (such as *Torn* by Rowenna Miller) or a setting where fashion itself is explored (like *A Mask of Mirrors* by M.A. Carrick). **HARD MODE**: The main character makes clothes or fibers. 



**Spin the Dawn by Elizabeth Lim:** 4 / 5 

Y’know, while I was reading this I was thinking “eh this is kinda YA-ish for me and not really my thing” but damned if it didn't keep me moderately entertained throughout.  The worldbuilding is nice and simple, the main character’s quest and story is about as cookie-cutter YA as it gets and the romance is very…..there, but the book never felt like a chore or boring to get through.  The book picked up considerably in the “quest” portion of the book and I was really hoping for some more fleshing out of the world, the theme seems to be imperial china but honestly outside of the main palace i didn't get a whole lot of that coming through and the world kind just fell to “generic fantasy locales’.  I was not very interested in continuing the series though and to me that's usually a signifier that a book cannot go higher than a 4 out of 5 for me. 



**A Book in Parts****:** Read a book that is separated into large sections within the main text. This can include things like acts, parts, days, years, and so on but has to be more than just chapter breaks. **HARD MODE:** The book has 4 or more parts. 



**Untethered Sky by Fonda Lee:3** 3.25/5

This was a really cool world and idea for a book that was just too damn short imo.  I kind of slotted this into my book in parts square on a whim after realizing the book is technically broken into 4 sections while reading, and this is my first introduction to Ms. Lee and I would definitely be interested in reading more of her work (ive neglected the Jade City series for FAR too long it sounds right up my ally), and the little mongolian steppes-esque vibes are really strong and neat it just….feels like there wasnt enough material for a fully fleshed out story.  All the plot threads kind of just stop abruptly towards the end and there was so much more I was expecting with the setup with the emperor and his great hunt but it kinda just…happens and then it works.  One thing I really enjoyed was how it was a book about animal handling where the animal in question is undeniably still a wild animal the whole time and the book never went schmaltzy with any ‘true bond’ or ‘animal-man friendship’.  Animal companions are all well and good, but having a book about working with apex predators that actually feels like people working with legit apex predators made it a lot more interesting and fresh to me, I just wish we kinda had more of an arc at the end. 



**Elves and/or Dwarves**: Read a book that features the classical fantasy archetypes of elves and/or dwarves. They do not have to fit the classic tropes, but must be either named as elves and/or dwarves or be easily identified as such. **HARD MODE**: The main character is an elf or a dwarf. 



**Orconomics by J. Zachary Pike:** 3.25/5

Man, this was a real letdown for me personally, I’ve heard great things about this book and was all set for a great comedy and an irreverent parody of quest fantasy and what I got was a surprisingly kinda downerish book with 3 standout funny sequences I can think of.  As i rule i greatly dislike most litrpg elements in books as all it does is immediately break immersion by making reference to real world game systems and while orconomics didnt go overboard with them the whole concept of ‘adventuring as a business’ felt a lot more gimmicky than anything and didnt have the more naturalistic implementation like say Dungeon Meshi (one of my favorites) or the absolute full on cards on the table balls out parody of a Dungeon Crawler Carl.  I guess that brings me to another issue I had: pretty much everything that this book was trying to do (humorous scenes in an overall fucked up dark warped world, satire and parody of fantasy tropes, litrpg elements, kind of a loveable loser hero) was done cranked up to 11 in Dungoen Crawler Carl whereas Orconomics really never left second gear for me.  There are points where I legitimately had to pause the audiobook in DCC because I was laughing so hard I was crying and parts in it that I was just straight up crying, that tonal back and forth is just done SO much better imo, whereas in Orconomics there was about a solid 3 scenes that legitimately made me laugh a little, and the only part that really somewhat got to me emotionally was the elf’s story as someone whos gone through addiction issues before.  Overall this book was NOT the terry pratchett light hearted funny romp nor the irreverent parody that goes from making the most outrageous jokes to tearing your heart out like DCC, it was just…..a kind of downer light litrpg with some punch up jokes in it.  I feel really bad going so hard on the book but honestly it was just so underwhelming to me :/.   



**Cozy SFF****:** “Cozy” is up to your preferences for what you find comforting, but the genre typically features: relatable characters, low stakes, minimal conflict, and a happy ending. **HARD MODE:** The author is new to you. 



**Legends and Lattes by Travis Baldtree:** 3.75/5

This was….good not great. Cozy has never REALLY been my thing since as a closeted massive edgelord and lover of all things grimdark, I really like a bite to my stories or some grit/realism.  But, I have been making a real effort recently to broaden my reading horizons, and there have been a few ‘cozy’ coded works that i have really quite enjoyed lately, namely Dungeon Meshi, Frieren and Long Way to a Small Angry Planet, but while all of those had cozy elements or were nice and fun….all of them had at least some sort of….stakes?  I never once in this entire book felt that the coffee shop was in like ANY danger, and while I get that that might be why some people love it due to low stress….it really never felt like Viv was really in any peril.  Theres just so many situations shes put in that kinda just….magically solve themselves for no real reason and that, to me, is kind of a mood killer.  Like in Long Way or Dungeon Meshi, all the characters are (mostly) reasonable and the mood is comfy for most of it, but the characters do meet adversity and problem solve their way through it and its very nice to see them do so.  It just feels like a lot of Viv’s problems are kinda just stuff shes gonna breeze through because shes a cool awesome protagonist and everyone loves her coffee shop…..a beverage that literally noone has ever tried or had a culture built up around it (like seriously, a major reason coffee shops became popular was it was a non-tea import from the new world that contained caffeine and wasnt hit with tea tariffs and like….the fact that its caffeinated is NEVER brought up as a marketing point….this might just be a me thing but that kinda bugs me).  Oh and the romance was….underwhelming in my opinion. The rat baker was awesome though, he was the carry.  



**Pirates****:** Read a book where characters engage in piracy. **HARD MODE:** Not a seafaring pirate. 



**Retribution Falls by Chris Wooding:**  4.5/5  Now THIS was a treat, ill admit the execution might have been a tad shaky but honestly this was just a fun ride for me, very much scratched that firefly itch i've had since like 2007.  You can definitely tell a lot of the crew’s stories are taken directly from other stuff but as a package, the pacing was solid, the action was fun, and I really feel like I cared a lot about each member of the crew.  I really like how the author gave shine to each crew member and still managed to keep the momentum throughout, the amount of character development was decent without ever feeling like it slowed down the story.  As soon as I finished the book, I was genuinely excited to start the next in the series, especially hearing as the series only gets better after the first book, and for someone who has chronic ‘drop one series after a few books and go on to a different series’ syndrome that is a very good sign that a series will be one of my favorites .",7,1744617347.0,Fantasy,1,1.0,False

I’ve successfully completely my first week with 2.8kg loss. I’m absolutely wrapped and also little floored at that number. (More to come of details in a sec)

Firstly though - I will share my first mistake! I ended up taking double the starter dose 2.5mg 🤪
Not ideal I know. But my pharmacy sent over tutorial vid for injection and the video missed part where you don’t just “push” the needle on you also need to screw it. I primed and only small amount of peptides came out so I jabbed anyways. Didn’t hurt at all, and no blood. Absolutely painless. Cleaned up chucked it in fridge went on … Then I read the leaflet and realised I was meant to screw the needle. Panicked I didn’t receive the dose I jabbed again (this time screwed on needle properly, and priming lots came out) and then went to bed. 

Next day watching more videos / posts I realised to check the clear window to see if I had taken both and for sure I def had two doses. 

So my results are based on starting Wk1 on 5mg! I had minor symptoms thankfully - dry mouth headaches, some constipation and only nausea after I had butter chicken serve made with coconut milk, clearly too fatty. 
Otherwise I’ve been ok. No hunger, some insomnia. 

Past History update: Weight loss world is not new to me, I had a gastric sleeve in 2021 and lost my entire excess body weight in 6months. 

Only reason for regain-  I was in horrific car accident Dec 2023 - truck hit me from behind and pushed me into freeway causing me to hit 5 other cars. My injuries and lack of movement meant I regained 15kgs. So.. here we are. 

My goal is to lose 23kgs putting me in healthy BMI again ideally in 4-5 months before I need more surgery. Not being able to move / train like I use to means diet is key for me.

I know the science behind weight loss I just needed the hunger suppression and inflammation reduction.

Wk 1 - Calorie Goal 1050 w/ 80g Protein, super clean no processed foods, minimum 3.25L water (not including electrolytes and milk / coffee), two walks one hydro therapy. 

Had constipation straight away but felt urge to go so Day 2 added in Osmolax and extra fiber / calcium gummies. 

I weigh daily to track patterns. Results below. 
Best part is - I’ve hit my daily target each day and I’m out of Obese 1 and into Overweight - Massive for me! 

Starting week two today on correct dose 🤦🏼‍♀️ 2.5mg let’s hope the hunger stays away.

Hope this is helpful to any other new starters

I’m a detective, and for the past 3 years, my department and I have been chasing a ghost, a monster — and now I think he’s coming for my family. 

I don’t have concrete proof yet, I'm not sure if it’s him… But If something happens to me, or to them, I need someone to know it wasn’t random. It was him.

Three years ago, the town of Silver Creek was terrorized by a serial killer. It began when a girl named Kristine went missing. She was out with some friends at a local concert, but unfortunately never came home. 

Her parents filed a missing persons report, and despite numerous searches and interrogations, nothing came of it. About 2 weeks after she had gone missing, a hiker had found a mangled body in the woods. After extensive DNA testing, it was revealed to be Kristine.

Theories began to fly, from people saying she had fallen off the trail, to people saying she had been attacked by a wild animal, nobody was sure. Just months after Kristine was found, police were called to investigate a case of home invasion. 

When they arrived, they found Cathy missing, and her parents dead. That’s when the city realized what was happening: A killer was on the loose. I originally was assigned to the case of Cathy’s parents, to figure out what had happened. 

The crime scene was one I will never forget. Cathy’s mother had died of blunt force trauma, and the father had been cleaved with what we assumed to be an axe.

Despite searching the scene, we found no prints. The back door was open, the killer probably slipped in when nobody was looking. After talking to the neighbors, they said they had heard screaming, but saw nothing.

For the next year, we tried our best to find the killer as he got bolder. A couple had been hacked, a car was found crashed with a bloody trail leading to a man’s body, and a group of teenagers camping were all found dead, with a few of the bodies having been dumped in a lake. 

We spent so much goddamn time trying to find the monster, but he was always gone by the time a call was made.

Some people around the office began to say he was a ghost. No evidence, seemingly able to travel great distances fast, and almost invisible. As panic began to rise, our mayor held a press conference giving a name to the monster: The Silver Creek Slasher.

Headlines ran wild with the name, plastering it everywhere, which only instilled more fear in the town. They didn’t care though, it had people talking, and that’s what pays. 

After the carnage the monster had made, we finally had a break. Another missing person, Leanne, was spotted on the side of the road a few days after she had been reported missing. A trucker had seen her, visibly shaken and injured, as well as looking thin. 

According to the driver, she was emotionally distraught, sobbing and begging the driver to take her to the police, as she kept looking outside fearfully.

After she had calmed down and was safe, me and my partner, Damon, went to talk to her. She had said that a tall man had put a rag with what I guess was chloroform over her mouth, causing her to faint. 

When she woke up, she was in a small padded room, restrained to a chair. After a few days, she had been able to undo the restraints, and ran into the woods. 

She said for a few days, she hadn’t seen or heard anything. When asked to tell us the location she had escaped from, she mentioned an abandoned shipping container in the woods.

When officers arrived, they found a rusty old shipping container. When they opened it, they found what we had dubbed ‘The Toybox’ — a padded room with a chair for restraining people, and an assortment of surgical tools and weapons. The room was covered in dried blood, presumably from the other victims.

With the killer’s hideout found, it was only a matter of time before we caught the bastard. But when the news made the headline, the killer vanished. And for the next 2 years, nothing happened. No home invasions, no kidnappings, no murders, nothing.

Even though the killer had stopped, the town never rested. He was a stain on Silver Creek, and even 2 years later, going over the evidence, it’s unbelievable how he got away. There was nothing to give even a hint to his identity. It was bizarre.

But, as you can probably guess, something has changed recently. Yesterday I was asleep when I woke up from my cell phone ringing. When I answered, I heard Damon’s voice. 

“Jasper, you need to get down here.” 

“What happened, Damon? Did your car break down agai-"" 

“A body was found. They think he struck again.” Damon interrupted, his voice stern. 

“You’re shitting. I’m on my way. Tell the chief I'll be there in 10.” I said, throwing on my jacket and hopping in my car.

As I floored it through the dark streets, gliding past the pine trees and rain-soaked hills of Silver Creek in the spring, all I could think about was the fact that he was back. He couldn’t be, right? A copycat, or a freak accident, or just another unrelated homicide. But, it wouldn’t surprise me.

I sometimes wonder if I'm cursed. Everything good that happens is followed by something terrible, that keeps piling on until I'm at my limit once again. 

Last summer, my wife passed away from a stroke. Our children were devastated, my oldest, Lucas, couldn’t attend any events for a while. He had cut off everyone, missed days of school, and fell into a depression. 

My youngest daughter, Stephanie, was just turning 12, and was also devastated, to the point where she was seeing a children’s therapist, one who she still visits today.

Lucas has somewhat healed. Although her memory still brings pain, the surface level wounds have healed. Why am I telling you this? Maybe to vent, or maybe to give a better understanding of my mental state. Even as I write this, I think about her.

When I got to the station, I read the report. The victim was a male, about 32, and had a major gash in the head, and was dumped on the side of the highway. 

The man was identified as Mr. Perlman, and the culprit was once again unknown. “So, what makes you think it’s him?” The Chief said.

“Most of his victims had been struck in the head with an axe. Seemed to be his weapon of choice. Either this is a copycat, or the Silver Creek Slasher is back in business.” Damon said.

“Don’t even say that shit” I said, picking up a folder and sitting at my desk. 

“Are there photos of the scene?” I said, logging in to my computer so I could begin writing a case report.

I didn’t get home until around 3pm the next day. It was miserable, I felt like shit, and after being souped up on coffee and five-hour energy, I was ready to crash. 

When I got inside, a few minutes later the bus dropped off Stephanie, and Lucas pulled his car into the drive a bit later.

I ended up falling asleep, and told the kids to order something for dinner, as I'll eat when I wake up. A while later, I woke up. 

The clock read 8:30 pm, and I got out of bed to go downstairs. After finding something to eat, I crashed again. Morning came, and when I came downstairs, I saw my daughter, Stephanie, pissed off.

“Hey Steph, everything alright?” I said.

 “Look at this dad!” Stephanie said, gesturing me outside. When I stepped out, I saw something strange. On our porch laid Stephanie’s bike. 

But it was destroyed. The paint had been scraped off, the tires slashed, and the handle broken. 

“What in the..?” I looked up, and noticed my car had been scraped too. 

“Hey, what the hell?” I said, running over to my car.

As I grabbed the door, it was unlocked. This struck me as odd, as I know I had locked it when I got home yesterday. Inside, everything was trashed, my radio had been cut, papers everywhere, and a marker on my window spelled out ‘Father Of The Year’ in large, red letters.

My son’s car had been vandalized too. The words ‘Missed A Spot’ were scribbled on his windows. 

“What the hell could that mean?” I said. After going back inside, I questioned Lucas to see if the phrase meant anything to him, or if his friends had played a prank on us.

“What kind of friend would do that? They’re not morons, dad.” 

“Kids these days have sick ideas of what’s funny. Any classmates you know that are troublemakers?” I said. 

“How about instead of people I know, look into people you know. Maybe someone you locked up got angry and decided to screw with you.” Lucas remarked.

“Besides, doesn’t that old lady across the street have cameras?” Lucas said. I stopped, realizing that he’s right. 

“I can’t stand her, she’s so rude, even by old lady standards.” I said, getting up and heading towards the door. 

“Get your stuff ready, the bus will be here soon.”

“Dad, it’s Saturday.” Stephanie said.

 “Is it? Shit, my bad.” I said, turning around and heading across the street. After talking to Beth, and helping her use her smartphone, we were able to pull up the video from last night.

At 2:43 AM, the cameras picked up a silhouette slipping from the treeline. It moved slowly, almost alien, pausing to scan the yard before locking onto the front door. 

The figure just stood there… motionless, staring, for what felt like forever. Then it crept toward the window, its face just out of view, peering into the living room.

A minute later, it vanished around the back of the house. I balled my fist, waiting, my pulse pounding. When it returned, it didn’t hesitate — painting the car windows, kicking over my daughter’s bike, tearing into anything it could reach. 

Then, just like that, it turned and vanished into the woods, as quickly as it had come.

“What the hell? What’s going on?” The old lady said, looking at me. 

“We had someone vandalize my shit. I’m letting the force know. Any way you can send the footage to me?” I said, standing up.

“I think I know how to. Just make sure they don’t get my car as well.” Beth said, in an almost snarky tone.

 “He won’t,” I said, annoyed.

I just emailed the report to my chief, as well as Damon, and I'm currently waiting on a response. I could head to the station, but I want to stay home. I’m not a deeply religious person, but I prayed that it was just a kid playing a prank. 

But with another person dead, and how strangely the figure moved, it’s too much of a coincidence. I think the Silver Creek Slasher is back, and he has begun targeting my family.

Is this an okay apology?



I’ve been thinking about doing this for a long time, but didn’t know what to say or how to say it, I didn’t know how to explain my actions without blaming them on other people and to be perfectly honest I still don’t but I’m sorry, what I did to you (blank) and (blank) back then was shitty and wrong, so stupidly wrong and from the moment it all happened I regretted it. I created this huge rift in the family at a time when it was important that we stuck together, I don’t expect you to forgive me straight away, I can’t even begin to imagine the amount of pain I caused on top of the grief you were already going through and that was absolutely disgusting of me to do. Like I said I don’t expect you to forgive me straight away and it’s okay if you never do forgive me, I would understand, I just wanted to apologise.

There's a *very popular* café nearby—famous for their banh mi, solid coffee game, and those *flavoured* iced Vietnamese coffees (you know the one). It's right next to a well-known glasses store with fun seasonal displays and an in-store dog.

Now, I won’t name names (Reddit rules and all), but here's your warning: **this café has a serious rat and mice infestation.** I tried reporting it directly to the owner, and his response? He’s known about it for **over six years** and ""can't fix it."" Right.

If you want to see it for yourself, stroll past after sunset and look closely at the ground—you’ll likely spot the furry residents having their nightly meeting.

Unfortunately, this isn’t an isolated issue. I’ve started paying attention to other spots, and I’m seeing the same problem pop up at several QV restaurants. Wouldn’t be surprised if the newly opened restaurant next door is in on the action too.

And that fresh “No Dogs Indoors” sign? Hmm. Could it be because a curious pup might expose something skittering in the corners?

I feel especially bad for the families and kids eating there, totally unaware. Just something to keep in mind next time you’re deciding where to grab lunch.

I’m a 32 yr old female coffee shop owner and barista. I specify on “female” since it presents differently; but any insight really helps. 

I have ADHD and I’m medicated with Vyvanse. But ever since I’m medicated I feel my sensory issues are through the roof!!! Im actually thinking I also have autism. 

In the 2 years of operation I have been able “to work on” or maybe mask?¿ my sensory issues. They don’t affect me right there and then like it used to in the beginning (I would get angry, make careless mistakes in order to just get it over with, be mean to my husband or being snippy with customers) now I’m able to stay calm and do things right even if I’m overwhelmed. But afterwards I collapse.

I work around 23hrs a week on bar but as an owner I sometimes stay 1 or 2 hours after I finish my shift, doing lots of things. Our business is picking up A LOT and the weekends are usually non-stop, high demand, from 7am-noon. Also at home I work on admin stuff for the business.. etc..

By around 10am I’m ready to take my skin off. I start getting irritated, overwhelmed, it’s just chaos in my brain. I literally feel like screaming and crying, all at once. My back pain drives me crazy. I recently “injured” myself and I have been struggling with *extreme* SI Joint pain. 

But even whenever I get home I’m OVERLY overstimulated and overwhelmed. I even feel my body buzzing and I get the feeling like when you go to a nightclub with really loud music and then you go home at night and your ears and hearing is all weird?¿ (does that make sense).. anyways…I go right into doom scrolling, hair pulling and skin picking for the rest of the day. Feeling wired but tired. Executive dysfunction is also through the roof! 

This repeats itself EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I have Sunday and Monday off, but on Saturday’s I usually have a breakdown.. from all the stress of the week and just feeling like I’m “stuck” because next week is going to be the same. So, even on my days off I’m still breaking down and not being able to even rest. 

I also have lots of guilt because I feel I’m not doing enough. My husband does most of the stuff. I feel that no matter what I do I’m always struggling with my mental health or physical health. I get into depressive episodes and really just think of *unaliving* myself because this can’t be life!!

£8.50 per gram 

Non irradiated 

Indica hybrid 

First class funk X grape gasoline 

Evening strain for pain relief and sleep 


No need for a first impression with this one. I've been wanting to try this strain for a long time now but it's either been out of stock or the price was over my budget at £10 per gram. So when it went back down to £8.50 I had to try it.

I've had this since Saturday and used it for two nights so far, using my arizer extreme Q 4 with the bag and 0.2g each session. Starting around 7pm until 10pm, I had 3 sessions over 3 bags...

Even though I've been a bit bunged up. On opening the tub I'm hit with a fruity/berry gassy smell. This really does smell, it's especially noticeable after vaping too. 

The buds are all a decent size and not too dry, certainly not as dry as farm gas when I had it. Or most other Aurora strains I've tried.
They are well trimmed,covered in trichomes and have a bit of bounce when squeezed.
After a couple of days with a boveda in a glass jar they are spot on for me, just the right amount of moisture content for a smooth vape and no coughing. I'm vaping at 195oc the first two bags then 200oc on the last bag. 

The taste is unusual it's kind of like how it smells,but less berry and more gassy. I'm not really getting any grape. It's a nice taste and it's improving each day.

The effects took me by surprise. I'm not sure what I was expecting really but I'd read the reviews and comments and how much of a knockout strain it is. 
So after my first bag I felt relaxed but not sedated, after each bag the effects got better and better but not a knockout sedating strain for me, however my pain was melted away ,my eyes were heavy and I felt good. 
Session number two an hour later and I could really feel it and by session three I was ready for bed by 10pm yawning away and struggling to get out of my chair to go to bed. 
I slept right through until 6am with no pain and in a good deep sleep state.
The downside both mornings I've woken up with that heavy weed hangover type feeling and it's taken two cups of coffee to clear it.
It also made me feel really hungry so be prepared.
i would really liked to have tried this strain when it first got released because people are saying it's not as good as it used to be. For me this strain is really good and I'd most definitely get it again if it stays at £8.50. In my opinion I think it's much better than farm gas and the quality is better than most Aurora products I've tried in terms of dryness and effects. 
I still wouldn't pay £10 a gram but £8.50 I'm more than happy with.🤜💚",1,1744615004.0,mcukmedicalcannabis,0,1.0,False
1jysyfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HellsKitchenFanFics/comments/1jysyfb/hells_kitchen_hollywood_episode_six_part_one/,Hell's Kitchen: Hollywood (Episode Six) (Part One),"**Previously, on Hell’s Kitchen…**

After a heart to heart with an emotionally compromised Sonja, Ramsay hit the reset button and tasked the chefs with the old-school feeling of grilling up some delicious dishes. In a hard-fought battle that saw many impress…

*Kiki: “You clearly know how to work a grill…”*

*Maddie: “It looks very traditional…”*

*Kiki: “It’s like an expensive painting almost…”*

…it was ultimately Sonja who would break the tie and break the red team’s losing streak, earning them a trip to a rooftop pool, as well as some new grills. While on the reward, Aisha’s heart would start to yearn for one Heather, while during the punishment, dreams were crushed as a sudden injury to Dante forced him out of the competition. With the blue team dropping quickly, Ramsay made the decision to send the promising Deonna over.

*Deonna: “I have to show Ramsay that his trust isn’t misplaced.”*

During dinner service, Heather and River pulled off a strong performance on the appetizers station, and Sonja would impress with her leadership...

*Ramsay: “That’s the voice I want to hear young lady!”*

But it wasn’t enough to prevent Jessie from struggling on fish….

*Ramsay: “Wayne Gretzsky wouldn’t even play with this!”*

…Vicky’s leadership causing a ripple effect in the kitchen…

*Sonja: “Vicky, I have it!”*

And Beth forgot the VIP table order…

*Ramsay: “I asked you to do one thing, one simple thing!!”*

While both teams completed service, it was Deonna’s strong leadership that resulted in a win for the blue team, although Sonja also gained praise. At elimination, the nominees were…

*Sonja: “Beth.”*

And…

*Sonja: “Jessie.”*

In the end, Ramsay would cut the Boston native, Beth loose, ending her dreams of the head chef position and a $250,000 salary at Gordon Ramsay Steak in Hollywood, Los Angeles.

[Remaining Chefs \(13 Chefs Compete\)](https://preview.redd.it/4obkytcr1rue1.jpg?width=1891&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bbd37b5ac9f97e1648a07d8beda48125b99c9ee)

***And now, the continuation of Hell’s Kitchen…***

After the elimination of Beth, both teams would head back to the dorms. As they did so, Jessie would say in her confessional that being on the chopping block again didn’t worry her, as even the best winners had a bit of a rocky start. In the dorms, the red team chefs were talking about how they could improve on last service, with Sonja asking Jessie why she was struggling so hard despite being taught by Meghan, to which Jessie said she had no idea. Unamused with this answer, Sonja would say in her confessional that being trained by a winner was something that she’d give her left arm for, and yet Jessie was coming off as the kid who slacked off a lot and still somehow came away with a passing grade. At one point, the talk of leadership came up, with Aisha saying that it seemed that no one could trust one another to lead. River seemed to be in agreement with this, saying in her confessional that Aisha had a point, and that everyone had a general idea of how they were on a professional level, but trust came from a personal level, so maybe it would be a good idea to get to know people on a deeper level. River had managed to gather Aisha, Heather, and Sonja into the red bedroom, ignoring the uneasy look Aisha had on when Sonja was present, and while they were talking about the previous service, River started to rib Heather about the looks she was giving Cassandra. In response, Heather would put her pillow over her head much to the amusement of the others. In her confessional, Aisha would say that she had to admit, it would be nice to get to know the real Heather, especially after she’s been stoic for so long, and her gushing over Cassandra was kind of cute in a way. River would ask Heather if she had any other crushes aside from Cassandra, and Heather would start to name the many…many crushes she had growing up, such to the extent the others in the room were surprised. River would say in her confessional that she initially asked her crushes simply to get to know her and maybe play a bit of matchmaker between Aisha and Heather, but she did not expect Heather’s crush list to be so diverse. Sonja meanwhile would say in her own confessional that Heather was not just any regular lesbian, she was downright thirsty. As Heather finished off her extensive list, the simple response was River telling her that she asked for some crushes, not an encyclopedia of every moderately attractive Disney character.

Meanwhile, the blue team was once more lacking their usual service discussion from Brian, instead being replaced by a conversation between Drew, Ted, and the newest member of the blue team in Deonna. The three were talking about their experiences, with Ted talking about the first time he cooked for his boyfriend and nearly burnt down the kitchen, saying in his confessional that Deonna and Drew have kind of become his closest friends up to this point, and with them being very strong chefs, he had a feeling they were going to all be in black jackets. At one point, Joey walked by, and Drew asked him if he wanted to join in. Joey would decline, and as he walked away, he said in his confessional he was disgusted with how the blue team accepted her so easily, especially after she took a spot that so rightfully belonged to someone else. Joey would talk with Kurt and asked if he agreed with Deonna coming off as too overbearing, to which Kurt said he wasn’t sure, but no matter what, he was going to win over her. Kurt would say in his confessional that he always respected a girl who could hold her own in the kitchen, but it didn’t matter if she was Amy Bouzaglo or Julia Child, he was going to beat her bad…before quickly adding on in challenges and service, not actually beating her. Back with the trio, Deonna would say she got into cooking to sort of keep herself busy, and to see if she can sort of settle back down into civilian life and maybe start a family. Deonna would say in her confessional that she was a bit late to the party when it came to settling down, but for so much of her life, it was nothing but work, and it’s all she’s known. Deonna would ask Drew his family situation, only for Drew to go quiet for a bit, before saying he was heading to bed, as he needed to be in tip-top shape to impress Ramsay, confusing both Ted and Deonna.

**Challenge**

The next day, the chefs would arrive downstairs to meet Ramsay in the dining room, who was standing on what seemed to be a red carpet. Seeing this, Jessie would ask in her confessional why the red carpet was out, before guessing it was probably for an important judge. As they finished lining up, Ramsay would greet them good morning and announce that tonight was steak night. Hearing that, Connor said in his confessional that he’s never been so excited for service before, as he’s said it before, and he’ll say it again, he loved meat. Ramsay would tell them that as part of their next challenge, they would each be challenged on their creativity with steaks, before stepping off the carpet and having it be rolled away to reveal a board with several stars on it with names written on it. Ted would note in his confessional that there were names on there like Stan Lee, Millie Bobby Brown, Whoopi Goldberg, all of whom were big names and Tatum O’Neal. Ramsay would say that these names on the stars were some of Hell’s Kitchen’s most famed guests, and not only that, but on the back of these stars would be the steak they would be cooking with. He would then address the blue team, as since the blue team had an extra member, two of them would be cooking with the same protein, and then their team would decide which dish to send up. Hearing that, Joey said in his confessional that he hoped he didn’t have to fight against one of them, not that he didn’t stand a chance, but because he felt like he shouldn’t have to argue to be taken seriously.

Ramsay would announce that with the blue having won the previous service, they would get to choose their opponent, and then the opponent they chose would choose a star. Ramsay would then call on Drew, asking him to choose his opponent, and Drew took little time before deciding on Heather, saying in his confessional that Heather was a solid chef, and if he wanted to get the blue team back on top, they needed someone who was one of the best, I.E., himself. Heather would think for a moment about a star to choose, before selecting Dita Von Tese, leading River to snidely ask in her confessional if Dita was also a crush, before thinking for a moment and deciding that she honestly wouldn’t be surprised. Under the star was filet mignon, and Ramsay would ask Aisha who she would love to go up against. Aisha would think for a moment, saying in her confessional that she wanted to prove that she could hold her own, and the best way to do that was to beat someone at their own game. With that, Aisha chose Connor, and Connor would select Jeff Dunham, under which would be hanger steak. Deonna went next and chose to go up against Vicky, and Vicky would select Kris Jenner, under which would be porterhouse. Sonja was next, and selected Kurt, and Kurt would choose Flo Rida, saying in his confessional he remembered when he showed up on Raw and got destroyed by the Social Outcasts, and he was about to repeat history when he smoked Sonja. Joey was next, and before he chose, Ramsay reminded him that his decision would also decide the last pairing. As Joey thought for a moment, he said in his confessional that while he knew he could win against any of them, he had to pick someone he knew he could win against. Joey would decide to go up against Jessie, saying that he felt like he could beat her. Jessie would say in her confessional that Joey was really gutsy, but there was no way he was beating her, especially with her training. Jessie would choose Lil Jon, revealing it to be T-Bone, leaving both River and the duo of Ted and Brian to face off, and River would be allowed to choose the star. River would select Stan Lee, and on his star would be ribcap. With the combinations decided, Ramsay told them that they each had 45 minutes, and their time started now.

With the chefs rushing into their kitchens, Ted would say in his confessional that being up against not only Brian, but River as well was a bit daunting, seeing as the former was a strong chef and the latter was one of the stronger chefs in the red team, so that meant he had to bring his A-game. In the blue kitchen, the chefs were already hard at work preparing their dishes, but one chef that seemed to have a bit of trouble with their dish right off the bat was Joey. Joey would say in his confessional that he knew his steaks well, but he’s never actually worked with a T-Bone before. Joey would ask Connor for a bit of help, saying that he’s never worked with a T-bone before. Drew, who overheard this, asked in his confessional how anyone could’ve never worked with a T-Bone steak in their lives, as when you come to Hell’s Kitchen, you come prepared. As Connor helped Joey prepare his steak, Ted and Brian were hard at work with their own ribcap dishes. The two would exchange a bit of friendly banter, but while it seemed all fine, Brian was a bit more determined, saying in his confessional that right now, he’s been on a bit of a spiral, but he had to prove that he should be taken seriously by having his dish be chosen.

Meanwhile in the red kitchen, the chefs were hard at work with their steak dishes. Sous Chef Michelle would come over to Sonja and asked what she was planning on for her new york striploin, to which Sonja said she wanted to make an anchovy chimichurri, something that interested Michelle. Sonja would say in her confessional that from where she comes from, anchovies were looked at as something you put on a pizza if you were crazy enough, but she’s had enough anchovy to be able to bring around even some of the anchovy haters. Meanwhile, Aisha was hard at work on her dish and even received a bit of help from Heather as she bounced back and forth between making sure her dish was good and bouncing ideas off her. However, it was also clear that while Aisha was still focused, her attention was waning whenever Heather came over. Aisha would say in her confessional that she was trying to focus on her dish, and she appreciated Heather’s help, but at the same time she just couldn’t focus when she was around. River seemed to have taken note, and told Heather to focus on her own dish while she helped Aisha. Vicky, seeing this all go down, said in her confessional that River was acting like she was mother hen or something, and Aisha clearly still needed help, meaning her punishment pass was nothing but favoritism.

As the time wound down, each chef would get their dishes plated and sent up to the pass. With all the dishes up, Ramsay would turn to the blue team and told them that since Ted and Brian both had ribcap dishes, they would have to choose one to send up. As the team started to discuss and Brian and Ted pleaded their cases, Brian said in his confessional he wanted every opportunity to prove to Ramsay as to why he should be his next head chef. However, while Ted explained his dish in a simple manner, much of Brian’s pleading came down to his record in challenges, to which Kurt said in his confessional meant jack shit considering Ted’s been just as strong in challenges, and he wasn’t waving around his challenge record, he was just letting his dish speak for itself. In the end, Deonna made the call to choose Ted’s dish, much to the chagrin of Brian.

Ramsay would start off with the battle of the T-Bone, as Jessie and Joey would face off. As they stepped forward, Jessie said in her confessional she had full confidence, and if it were against anyone else, she’d be maybe a bit less confident, but against Joey, it was essentially a free point. Jessie would start first, presenting her T-bone with miso, black garlic, asparagus, and onion carmel. Ramsay would note that when it came to dishes that were very simple, the presentation was something that had to carry the dish, and unfortunately, the presentation was not exactly eye-catching. Tasting the dish, Ramsay would say that it was seasoned well, the steak was cooked perfectly, but the dish wasn’t exactly anything that special. Moving onto Joey, he would present his T-bone with roasted carrots and red potatoes. Ramsay, upon looking at this dish, said that what he said earlier about presentation mattering when it came to simple dishes was justified, because although this dish was simple, it looked beautiful, and it was probably the best looking dish Joey made. Slicing the steak open, Ramsay said it maybe could’ve done with a minute more, but overall it was a solid effort, and worthy of a point. As the two went back in line, Joey said in his confessional he was happy to have finally scored a point, and from this point on, there was no bimbo who was going to stop him from reaching the top.

Up next was the battle of the filet mignon, as Heather would face off against Drew. As they approached, Heather said in her confessional that she was admittedly taking a bit of a risk in her dish, but against someone like Drew, risks had to be taken if she wanted to win. Drew would present first, showing off his seared filet mignon with a blueberry cabernet reduction, garlic mash, and grilled asparagus. Ramsay would note that the presentation was very clean and well put together, and when tasting the steak, Ramsay said that the steak was cooked to perfection, and the flavors were good, calling it a strong effort. Moving onto Heather, she would present her filet mignon with sweet potato, crispy Kale, and coffee sauce. Immediately, Ramsay was confused by the coffee sauce, asking why she would even think putting coffee sauce over the filet was a good idea. Heather admitted she did it to take a risk, but Ramsay said there was a difference between taking a risk and jumping without a parachute, and she did the latter. To make matters worse, Ramsay said that while the filet was perfectly cooked, the sauce was bitter. Ramsay would easily award the point to Drew, giving the blue team a bigger lead 0-2. As they went back in line, Heather said in her confessional that she was going to be mentally beating herself up over this for the rest of the day.

Up next, it would be former teammates facing off, as Vicky and Deonna took each other on in the battle of the porterhouse. Vicky would start first, presenting her porterhouse steak with chimichurri sauce, grilled asparagus, and garlic mash. As she presented, Vicky said in her confessional that with no one getting a point so far, she was going to do something that no one else on this team has done yet, and that was lead by example. Ramsay would say that the presentation was very classical, and he could see this dish in Michelin star restaurants. Tasting the dish, Ramsay said that the dish had that wow factor, and called it a solid effort. Moving onto Deonna, Deonna would present her porterhouse steak with a teriyaki glaze, green haricot verts, and jasmine rice. Ramsay would however quickly point out that rice looked mushy, to which Deonna admitted she overcooked it. In her confessional, Deonna stated she hated rice so much, because she could never get it right. Ramsay would say that it was a shame that the rice was overcooked, because the steak was cooked perfectly, but he had to give the point to Vicky. With the red team slowly clawing their way back up 1-2, Vicky would say in her confessional that she set the bar, and it was time to see if anyone else could match her high standards.

In the battle of the new york striploin, it was Sonja taking on Kurt, and Sonja would present her new york striploin with anchovy chimichurri, and smoked pomme puree. Ramsay would admit the idea behind the chimichurri was interesting, but it actually tasted quite nice. Meanwhile, Kurt’s cajun spiced striploin with chanterelle mushrooms and shallots was praised for having a good cook and great flavor, and after a bit of a tough decision, Ramsay elected to give both of them points. Then in the battle of the hanger steak, Aisha’s Indian spiced hanger steak with masala roasted potatoes and cucumber and yogurt raita was praised for the seasoning and the perfect cook, while Connor’s hanger steak with carrots, broccoli, potato, and blackberry rub was praised for a perfect cook, but criticized for a foul tasting rub, resulting in Aisha gaining another point for the red team and tying the score up 3-3.

In the final round, it was River and Ted facing off in the ribcap round, and as they approached, Ted said in his confessional that everything was coming down to the wire, and he knew that River was going to be no pushover in the slightest. Ramsay would start out with Ted, and Ted would present his seared ribcap with creamed spinach, black garlic, and shallots. Ramsay would say that the presentation had a rustic vibe to it, and upon slicing open the steak, he said it was cooked to perfection. Hearing that, Ted said in his confessional that he wasn’t a betting man, so it was why he wasn’t going to hedge his bet on beating any dish River made unless it somehow wasn’t as good. On that note, River would present her rib cap with a balsamic reduction, cumin, and grilled corn salsa. Ramsay would note there seemed to be a lot going on, and said that the dish looked a bit clumped together. Tasting it however, Ramsay said that the flavors were phenomenal, and the ribcap was cooked perfectly. Ramsay would say this was a tough decision, and as he thought, River said in her confessional that she was begging for a win right now, and she didn’t want the red team’s previous challenge win to be a fluke. After a bit of deliberation, Ramsay said that the winning dish belonged to…

\*

\*

\*

\*

\*

…Ted, ending the score at 3-4 and giving the blue team the win! As the blue team celebrated and Ted received a high five from Kurt and Drew, Ted said in his confessional that winning the challenge for the blue team was a phenomenal feeling, and it was about time they got back to their winning ways in challenges.

Ramsay would congratulate Ted on having the winning dish, saying that was his best dish yet, and as a reward for the blue team getting back to their winning ways, he was going to reward them with a taste of Hollywood, as they were going to be having a night in their very own palatial mansion. Hearing this, Kurt said in his confessional that he didn’t know what palatial meant, but all he needed to hear was the word mansion and he knew it was going to be great. In addition to that, they would also be served dinner by a dear friend of his, Aaron Sanchez. Upon hearing that, Connor said in his confessional that being served by Aaron Sanchez was huge, and he was a master of several cuisines. Turning to the red team, Ramsay announced that while the blue team were going to be eating steak, the red team were going to be cutting steak, as they had to bring in and break down a whole cow. Hearing this, River said in her confessional that this was going to suck, as while she may be nothing but meat, she’s seen how big cows get, and they’re no match even for her. Before sending both teams on their way, Ramsay reminded Aisha that she had her punishment pass and asked if she wanted to use it. Almost immediately, Aisha said she would love to use it, prompting Vicky to say in her confessional that Aisha was being selfish as hell, as she failed just like the rest of the team, and if anything, the better thing would be to let her take the pass. With Aisha using her pass, Ramsay would ask Aisha who she was swapping places with, and as Aisha took her time to decide, Joey said in his confessional he hoped it wasn’t him, because he proved his dish was good, so he shouldn’t be pushed for it. Ultimately, Aisha decided that Kurt should take her place in the punishment, and as the two went over to their opposing teams, Kurt said in his confessional that he was pissed off because he had a good dish, but he wasn’t going to act like a crybaby. With that, Ramsay told the red team and Kurt to get to work, and the blue team and Aisha to get dressed.

As the red team and Kurt went upstairs and waited for the truck to arrive, one chef was particularly upset about their loss, and that chef was Heather. Heather would say in her confessional that she felt awful about putting up that dish, as if she didn’t dump that coffee sauce over the filet, they could’ve had a real chance at winning, and she felt like she was responsible for that loss. River noticed Heather’s downtrodden expression, and told her that she didn’t score either, so if she was blaming herself for the loss, then she shouldn’t. Heather would say at least River’s dish was good, but she messed up her own dish with that coffee sauce and just hated how she took what could’ve been a damn good dish and butchered it. Hearing that, River would say that Heather’s dish was good, it was just that coffee sauce that hurt it, so it wasn’t like the dish was irredeemable, and that they were going to bounce back from this. Heather accepted those words, and they would join the others, with River saying in her confessional that she’s glad that Heather got that out of her system, because she was a good chef, and Hell’s Kitchen was something that took you to the limit and brought out the worst in you, so for all intents and purposes, they possibly avoided another Sonja incident.

Meanwhile, the blue team, joined by Aisha, had just arrived at the mansion, and as they walked up, Deonna said in her confessional that the mansion looked absolutely beautiful, and she’s never been in a place that was this high class before. The chefs would start looking out over the balcony, taking in the sights, and Connor would say in his confessional that these sights were sights he’d never thought he’d see in his life, and he was grinning like a pig in shit. Later on that night, the chefs were being served steak dinners by Chef Aaron Sanchez, and every chef seemed to be grateful towards Aaron for the meal, with Drew saying in his confessional that being served by Aaron Sanchez felt like a fever dream. However, one chef was noticeably subdued about their reward, and that chef was Brian. In his confessional, Brian said he wanted to be happy and talk with his team, but having his dish dropped from the challenge stung, especially when it was Deonna making the final call. Joey seemed to notice this and said in his confessional he wasn’t sure why Brian was being such a bitch, but whatever the case, it wasn’t his problem. Later on, as the chefs were continuing to hang out in various places throughout the mansion, Aisha and Ted would be alone together, and Aisha would ask Ted if he could give her some advice, as he seemed to be the only gay guy here. A confused Ted said sure, and Aisha would ask Ted how he came to terms with being into guys. Ted would reveal that his whole acceptance of being into guys came pretty quickly, but it can take longer for some people based on a few factors, and asked why. Aisha would admit that she might be the same way and didn’t know how to go about it. In her confessional, Aisha admitted that ever since the first reward she went on, she’s been thinking about the possibility of her liking Heather, and that possibility was looking more and more likely, so she wanted to just know how to handle this. Ted seemed to understand where she was coming from as it was a new experience to her, and told her to go with what made her happy, and said in his confessional that he knew many people who didn’t have the ability or safety to come out, and he himself has lost a few close friends after he told them he was gay, so he might as well show Aisha that no matter what, there was going to be someone who accepted her. Aisha would thank Ted for the talk, and jokingly said to show her appreciation, she’ll hire him as a dishwasher once she won Hell’s Kitchen.

Meanwhile, back in Hell’s Kitchen, the red team and Kurt were doing their own team bonding, as the truck had just arrived, and Jessie had opened the door to see the cow carcass there. Jessie said in her confessional that she wasn’t someone to feel dread, but the moment she got a look at that cow, it was like her blood ran cold. The chefs would start to lift up the cow, with River and Kurt mostly taking a lot of the heavier parts, and Kurt would say in his confessional that picking up the cow was easy, and he’s slammed jabronis heavier than this. As the chefs started to get the cow inside however, one chef was taking their time in helping out, and that chef was Vicky. Vicky was noticeably putting in less effort into carrying the cow, mostly sticking near Kurt and River to act like she was holding up her side. Vicky would say in her confessional that she refused to be punished for the failings of her team, and that was why she was going to work smarter, not harder. The chefs would eventually get the cow inside and started to break it down, where Vicky once more annoyed her teammates by refusing to help break down the cow. Sonja would notice this, and said in her confessional that Vicky was the type of person who jumped into any position thinking everything was going to be handed to them, but the moment the dirty work was presented to them, they would bitch out. Sonja would demand Vicky to help out, only for Vicky to sarcastically tell her to ask nicely and she’ll consider joining in with the weak links. Sonja already looked to be on the verge of exploding, but River would chime in and asked if Vicky scoring a point meant she was better than all of them, to which Vicky said it did, and they didn’t have to like it, but they had to accept it. In her confessional, Vicky said that they were acting like kids because they couldn’t handle the truth, and was sure as shit that the moment they tried to get rid of her, they would regret it. Before an argument could break out, Heather told everyone to calm down and work on the cow, because they were wasting time. As the chefs begrudgingly got back to work, Kurt asked if this was what the red team was usually like, to which Heather dryly said Vicky being lazy was new.

The blue team and Aisha would eventually return from their reward and got to work on prepping for Steak Night. As both teams looked over their menus in the midst of prep, Connor said in his confessional that tonight should be easy, as he was going to be working meat, and tonight was steak night, so if anything, it was a match made in heaven. Ramsay would call both teams forward and told them to line up. Once the teams lined up, Ramsay told them that with tonight being steak night, he was expecting a lot out of them. For the blue team, he expected them to do everything in their power to keep their streak alive, and for the red team, he noted that they have not won service yet, so he was hoping to see them finally win. With that, Ramsay turned to Marino, and told him to open Hell’s Kitchen.

I’m a guy in my early 30s and I’m finally ready to retire the beat-up canvas backpack I’ve been hauling around for years. I’m looking for something a bit more polished but still practical for day-to-day use. Mainly, I want a bag that works for commuting to work, running errands around the city, and maybe the occasional coffee shop work session.

Ideally, it’d be something that:

* Has a clean, minimal look (not flashy logos)
* Can fit a laptop, charger, water bottle, and a book or two
* Is made of quality material (leather, waxed canvas, or something sturdy)
* Is comfortable to carry (I’m open to tote, messenger, or crossbody)
* Can take a bit of wear without looking destroyed after a few months

I’m aiming to keep the budget under $200, but if there’s something really worth stretching for, I’m open to it. I’ve looked at a few options from Bellroy, Troubadour, and even some on Etsy, but I feel like the community here probably has some great under-the-radar recs.",1,1744614987.0,handbags,1,1.0,False

Was I groomed?","I 21 F met a really attractive man 30 M at a club about 2 months ago. I was wasted, he was sober (he had 3 drinks throughout the night and then was able to drive home). I found myself swooned by him. I really thought this was gonna go nowhere and he’d just ghost me the next day. We obviously exchanged numbers. At the club, he immediately was touching my ass and making out with me. I was truly captivated by him. We sat in his car and just talked. I laid my head on his lap and he just listened to me. I can’t even remember what I was saying. I learned some hard stuff about his past. My past certainly contains abandonment, so I have some issues with this. 

I was a very lukewarm Christian at this time. Anyways. He had told me he broke up with his ex a week before he met me. Red flag, I know. Also my body count at the time was 2, his was 23… he claims none of them were hookups. So I text him the next morning and I apologized for reciprocating the romance since I wanted to be sensitive to his emotions and the recent breakup. He essentially said don’t sweat it and wanted to go on a date. So we played pool and he was just amazing. The way he laughed and how he just captivated me. I can’t explain it. We go back to his place and I get cozy (not like he hadn’t been grabbing my ass the other night). Then we start making out and he says “I only want this to go as far as you want it to”. We had sex. He said he couldn’t use a condom. Stupid because anyone can. 

After this though I had to travel home 8hrs away since I had really just been visiting family in my hometown. Ironically he was headed south for some training for work. We spend two incredible weeks together. We went on some dates and I was head over-heels. He seemed to be smitten as well. We had sex a few more times and it was okay. I’ve never really liked sex. But he was respectful. He just kept saying “who are you?” With amazement at my hobbies and quarks. He told me I deserved the world. Then things kind of got rough after he left. He just wouldn’t text often. I thought this was because he’s a millennial. But I came back home and we spent a coffee together (he was 20 minutes late) but we seemed to be on the same page. 

He was caring, he even went to my dad’s grave with me and just let me cry to him. Anyways, he didn’t text me for 2 days. We had plans and he ignored me. Then he comes in with a text after those two days saying he was so sick he couldn’t text. And you know, I was worried for him for those 2 days and I called maybe too much and texted maybe too much. It was pathetic. But I just can’t get over him. He said he shouldn’t have jumped in and disregarded my feelings by being physically intimate. And he told me he needed to work on himself since he tends to jump from woman to woman. Why did I have to be another precisely for him? He hasn’t texted me for weeks and we agreed we’d talk at the end of the month. Not a word. 
I feel like shit. I know so many red flags. But I love the way I want to be loved and accept what I think I deserve. I feel so stupid for trusting him. He said he wouldn’t ghost me. And here we are. My past is just too much, and people run. I want him, I can’t think about anyone else. I don’t want anyone else. But I can’t help but think I was maybe taken advantage of. I’m responsible for my own choices, I just feel so lost on this.",1,1744614983.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I gave him a disclaimer that I’ve just started my period and am just probably getting into my own head - but that I felt like he had clicked off his social media quickly when we were in the room together that day.

We’ve had issues with me feeling insecure and unsure in the past, mostly because I had a tough upbringing with the men in my life and past relationships. He doesn’t like when I express uncertainty to him because he says he wants to feel trusted. He also says that me not feeling trusting has led him to do things like hangout at his female coworker’s house for a bonfire without telling me before hand and showing up at home at 4 am, (I had expressed to him that I’d feel more comfortable hanging out with her and him together before I’d be able to say I’m okay with them hanging out one on one).

Also, he slept over at a female friends house one night when he was upset with me for not being comfortable with him going over to her house at night after he had just told me that my insecurities bother him.

Another time he had told me he was going to go hangout with a guy friend when I looked on his phone and he hadn’t even messaged the guy friend but had plans to hangout with a female friend of his. He told me that he still was going to reach out to the guy friend but that he didn’t want to say that it was the female friend off the bat because I might ask him questions he doesn’t feel like answering.

Anyways, we had just recently had a deep conversation about how I will not accept him blowing up angrily at me anymore and cussing at me etc. . He expressed to me how he’s very remorseful for not controlling his emotions more and that it’s never his intention to be that way. He’s often very kind but he definitely has a temper.

So I asked him tonight if his phone is private to him or if he feels like it’s something that I’m welcome to be on. If there’s anything on there that he wouldn’t want me to see, or if he’s been discussing anything that he wouldn’t want me to read. I understand that I *should* have this basic trust in him, and I do believe that he is faithful, but sometimes these fears creep up on me and I feel like I need to speak on them and ask for reassurance.

He called me selfish for asking him before he has to leave for work, he called me an unhelpful partner (how come I didn’t help him make himself lunch before work, yet I have time to make his day harder with heavy questions)? Which, I get it now that it was probably bad timing but I had been up since 3 am to go to work myself and spent the rest of our day taking care of our daughters. He was home all day, why should I have to make his lunch for him for me to be a helpful partner? He says I pick and choose what I do to be a helpful partner.

I told him that I just want a partner whom I can safely communicate my worries to even when I’m just getting into my own head. He said he’s tired of going over this BS over and over again but almost every time I bring it up he shuts it down like this so I never really feel concluded. I felt he was unkind and harsh with me, even though I was already in tears telling him that I shouldn’t have brought it up in that way/at that time. He continued to blame me for being the reason he now has to go to work upset or not show up at all.

What really got me what the fact that not even a week ago he had gotten angry with me when we were supposed to be on a coffee date before I left for work over my mom having his Xbox passcode. I had to spend the first half of my day fighting back tears from what he said. But now he is so upset that I would bring this up before he has to leave for work. It felt like a double standard to me and I hadn’t even said I thought he was cheating just that I felt emotional over the possibility that he could hide something from me.",1,1744614975.0,RedditRewinds,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 11: The Agent Was Tall, Actually**

 

Jack did an incredulous double-take at the question. “Are you serious? Coffee? Did you really say coffee?”

The secretary smiled widely. “How would you like it?”

“Black with two sugars.” It came out like a rote, and he smiled at how happy he was to say it again. How long had it been? *Two years. The pocketbook had to accept reality.* “Ma’am. Thank you.”

“No problem at all. Coming right up, Mr. Laker.” She exited, closing the door behind her.

*Mr. Laker? How about that? She says it like she likes to say it. Or maybe I’m imagining that. Yeah. Be real — she’s just really nice.*

Jack did not sit, instead taking a walk around idly. He got some refreshing chilled water in a little paper cup, gulped it down, and got some more. Eyeing the camera corner, he smiled and raised his cup. “Cheers, my watcher. Not taking a nap, are you? I wouldn’t sleep on *Mr. Laker*. Hehe.”

The secretary was exceptionally prompt, coming back through with coffee in a heavy-duty, insulated paper cup complete with a plastic sip lid. Jack set down his water to receive it in two hands, like a holy chalice, while the secretary obliged his reception with an air of amusement.

Jack took a glorious, *holy* sip and sighed immediately after, closing his eyes as the experience gave him literal goosebumps. He took another sip and was sure it was too much and would burn his tongue… nope. Not allowed!

*I can’t burn my tongue on hot coffee?! An incredible superpower!*

With tremendous, heartfelt gratitude, Jack said, “Thank you. Thank you so, *so* much, Madam Secretary.”

She laughed and shook her head. “Alice is fine.”

Jack’s eyes widened. “No way. Your name is Alice?”

She nodded with a raised eyebrow. “Does it mean something?”

“Oh. Well. Kind of. I-I like it!” *No way am I telling her it's my car’s name.*

“Good to hear. Well, I need to go and print some things out. Paperwork, as always. Doing okay, here?”

Jack waved his hand, having to swallow another sip of coffee quickly — *which didn’t burn!* “Oh, no, no, I’m fine. Yep. You’re good. Print away!”

She smiled and nodded as her eyes slid away, and she departed once more with the sound of heels clicking down a hallway behind a closed door.

*Alice The Secretary. Quite a woman. A bombshell, really. A little older? Hard to say, but probably. I should flirt more, maybe- no, no. Get it together, Jack! This is Serious Time. She’s just really nice. But ‘Alice’? Isn’t that destiny calling? Probably has a boyfriend. Husband. Naaah.*

In truth, the whole experience was surprisingly mundane and ultimately held a vague familiarity. Like coming in at two in the morning to a little, quiet base with just a few yawning sentries, shipping department personnel, and of course — somewhat like Alice, he figured — the chatty night shift admin.

*The only difference is I’m waiting around to be grilled by a government agent. But that does kind of fit into my paradigm, unlike pretty much everything else that happened tonight.*

Jack waited around, enjoying a few more powerful and needed sips of delicious coffee, then forced himself to set it down to ration it. He paced. Paced and waited some more.

*The hell is taking so long? Isn’t this a priority issue? I guess I’m not so damn special, after all. Ha. Just another schmoe waiting on the government. Everything is a procedure! Take it slow, slow, so damn slow, slow and safe, so slow we move at microscopic speeds! Especially if there is ‘Change.’ That’s a no-no word. We come up on Change, we stop dead and contemplate how we can go around it.*

Change did finally come for Jack, though — the change of an opened door. An exceptionally typical, military-suited agent walked in, face like every other, hair like every other, manilla folder in his hand like every other. The military suit was not a serviceman uniform — it denoted a military intelligence agent. A top cop. It was black over white and very similar to the Old World stereotype, but the white shirt had a heavier, higher collar, the vest was bigger and less stylish, and they never had ties. The jacket was also never closed and had no buttons.

In a voice like every other, the agent asked, “Mr. Jack Laker, correct?” as he closed the door shut behind him.

Jack simply nodded, steeling himself. The agent had on a pair of thick, black, wrapping mirrored shades, something Jack understood was high-tech. HUD, augmented reality visuals, so on. Any sort of elite or key personnel had it, one way or another.

“Have a seat, please, Jack,” the agent commanded, as he pulled a chair out himself. “I’m Agent Cancun. You may address me as that, Agent C, or sir, as you prefer.”

“Yes, sir.” Jack and the agent sat down roughly at the same time.

Agent C opened his folder, moving the first page to his left, but it didn’t seem like he was studying it. “Mr. Laker, I am charged specifically with understanding your *situation* leading up to your questionable decision point. You are aware, and were aware, that the subject you came into contact with was an unknown, anomalous, inhuman being from outside Memorial-controlled territory?”

Jack swallowed the sip of coffee he had in his mouth. He took a deep breath after. “Yes. But-”

“And you understand that such beings are universally Kill-On-Contact and to not be interacted with in any other way?”

“I’m not military. Even when I was, I was a *pilot*.”

“Yet you were under the same provision of duties and orders as everyone else in this regard. All citizens serve and are considered reserve members of the military for defense, with required training and drill dictates, whether excused in technicality or not. So you were not aware of your own process of orders and conduct, is that correct, Mr. Laker?”

Jack fought off a grimace. “I was not at all aware that Neex was a foreign alien until long after the rescue. I did not have the intel. At first, I thought she was just a modified human. Does she look like a monster to you?”

The agent didn’t answer, just waited placidly and stared.

Jack sniffed. “Well, she didn’t to me. She just seemed like a *human being* who was scared ten ways to Sunday — terrified, really — and running for her life from the Bad Guys. Excuse me if my *programming* tells me to help instead of shooting her between the eyes.”

“And this ‘programming’ also dictated your behavior after you *did*, in fact, realize what she was?”

“If you want to see it that way. There was no way I could do what you’re suggesting after interacting with her to that point. She’s a gentle soul, basically… even after being rather abused by those who found her first. She never even seemed to hold a grudge. I think it's because she’s a scientist. She regards their behavior animalistically — or anthropologically. She remains impartial even after suffering and losing her friends.”

“Did you ever consider this could be the cold and calculating maneuvering of a relative sociopath? A manipulator? She had reason to bring you into her confidence, correct?”

Jack shook his head. “Not one sign of this. Not one. Even her modes of expression seem honest. It’s obvious when she’s sad or embarrassed. Sure, it could be some grand act, I guess. But she was ready to die, even. She wasn’t trying to manipulate me. She *thanked me* and tried to pass on a message of *peace*, though communication was difficult. Like… she forgave us for getting her and her friends killed, dude. Er, sorry — Agent C.”

After clearing his throat, Jack continued, “I only saved her due to piecing together that I might have the ‘heart’ she needed. She wasn’t even asking me to get it. She thought it was lost completely. I know she thought those were her last moments. There’s no fraggin' way to fake *that*. And she remained the pinnacle of grace.”

The agent said nothing immediately, just looked down, slowly turning the pages. Jack expected questions to advance to the ‘choice’ part, but perhaps he’d already damned himself with his long ‘Mem-mail’ message sent on the subject. In fact, Jack thought the agent might even be reading it right then.

Agent C looked up, finally, and asked, “Why did you not report to Memorial territory or to her agents at any point in this situation? Do you not trust your own, even as you trust this *nicknamed* anomalous foreign agent?”

Jack was sure he had a sour expression as he fought off a scowl. “Memorial agents cultivate an aura of mystery and fear, sir. You *must* know that much. Logically, you have to take the pluses and the minuses. One of the latter being your own people being afraid of reporting things.”

“Please answer my questions, Mr. Laker.”

“I primarily didn’t report initially due to not knowing her desire, as a presumed human being with *rights*, with where to go and what to do. She was unconscious. I kept her out of the territory not knowing her status with you sorts.”

“Are you saying that you deliberately obstructed Memoria from knowing about something clearly anomalous, whatever you thought she might be?”

“Look, I could’ve violated the protocols of her citizen status on some other platform. Agent C. Would someone from some independent Boonieville approve of being carted right to the Mems they despise? That’s just my taxi-man instincts, not my bleeding heart. Hell, I could get in trouble for that based on some bullshit treaty violation I triggered! And then I’d be sitting here for a whole other reason, right?”

“Isn’t it true, though, Mr. Laker, that this Neex was willing and even wanted to contact Memoria, and you were well aware of this before making your questionable decision? It wasn’t even you or her that ended up making contact, but your uncle. If agents had arrived sooner, casualties may have been avoided.”

Just when Jack was feeling pretty confident in his answers, the armor-piercing bullets dropped. *People died.* Guilt hit him in the gut and he looked down at the table, not responding at first. “We were going to. I did make a… judgment call. If I’m honest, I don’t know the timing or if things would’ve been different. I guess you do. Frag me, I made the calls I made. I never would’ve thought they were tracking us or would come like that. I thought I did everything right in that respect. Sir.”

“Why did you delay, Mr. Laker?”

“I guess we wrap around back to the point, eh? Trust. I was afraid of exactly the protocol you sat there and chirped right in my face about. That you’d kill her first and ask questions later. And that leads right into my ‘questionable decision,’ doesn’t it? I wanted it as proof and clout before we did the introduction.”

“And is that the only reason, Mr. Laker?”

Jack didn’t bother answering. He felt like Agent Cancun knew everything from the start and was just getting it on record from the horse’s mouth. The Mems were thorough. They liked the ‘full dimensionality of the truth.’ He remembered that term, from a lecture at military school. Once upon a time, he considered his chances of being one of them. But he’d simply gone a different way, for the Wonder and Wander of the free and open airways. Flying had turned into his drug, he supposed.

Agent Cancun pulled a little stapled bundle out of the folder, placed a pen on top of it, and slid it over to Jack. “Your statement of events, from the top.” He collected up his manilla folder, stood, and pushed his chair in. “I’ll return shortly. I need to go take a shit.”

Jack stared incredulously as the agent exited. *Seriously?*

Shaking his head, Jack sighed, took another swig of coffee, and took up the pen to begin writing.

A few minutes after he started, Alice brightened the room by entering. Smiling apologetically, she placed a huge packet of papers in front of him. “I am so, *so* sorry, Mr. Laker! I need like ten *billion* signatures. I’ve highlighted them, though. Routine acknowledgments. Procedure, procedure, procedure.”

“Oh, great,” Jack said as he sat back and briefly returned the smile. *Such a nice perfume.* “Guess you want me to get this over with now?”

She winced, nodded, and smiled all at the same time somehow, holding one hand in the other. Jack couldn’t help finding it adorable.

He glanced at the document’s first page. Generic ‘I swear I am who I say I am and am being truthful’ sort of stuff. He signed. The second page… a whole lot of nothing new. Signed. Third page, he stifled a sigh of annoyance even trying to scan it. Signed.

“This shit is… like a textual brick,” Jack muttered.

“Yeaaah…” Alice agreed breathlessly with another apologetic expression.

He went page by page with brief review, struggling not to give up and chain-sign against the power of the mountainous climb to understand even one percent of the tome in front of him. Especially with Alice waiting there so patiently and sympathetically. Some last shreds of paranoia and stubbornness kept him from doing it, though — kept him scanning over it somewhat, even as it made him feel like an asshole.

Almost carbon copies of his military service agreement showed up, as between ‘Archon Memoria’ and a ‘licensed agent.’

“Alright, so- okay,” Jack mumbled. “This is in here, too, then. Okay. Fine, I guess.”

“I’m sorry?” Alice asked.

“I just wasn’t expecting a service contract in here. I guess that’s a good sign? Do you… do you… know? About…” He trailed off.

“That you’re slated as an Agent Nonpareil, beginning as a Junior Agent Exemplar? Of course, Mr. Laker. I should think it a good sign, certainly, especially considering any trouble you’re in would have to acknowledge your new status first.”

“Ah. Right! I can see how that would be beneficial. Guess I better get this signed before I’m tossed over the platform, then!” He laughed, knowing he was a bit hysterical and a whole lot strained but unable to stop himself.

Alice smiled politely and mildly, not quite showing teeth.

Jack shifted uncomfortably as he looked back down at the… contract. *It is what it is. Come on, I can get through this… how many was that? Twenty? There’s like a hundred here! And I need to write this stupid statement, too. Frag me, man…*

Not quite halfway through, his eyes caught on something on the document page, even as he was poised to sign. He re-read the block of text.

>3. The licensed agent agrees to submit consideration to all individually assigned situational rulings as dictated by Archon and written for agreement, or suffer punishment as infractions befitting the severity of non-participation. Archon will acquire approval from no less than three licensed Homo Sapien magistrates and the PM for amended situational rules (such as removal or subtraction of a rule). Initial situational rules require PM approval and consist of the following:

>(a) Development and training upscaling due to age abnormality. The licensed agent will be expected to be mission-ready within months rather than the customary 4-7 year period. Reasonable additional hardship is expected.

>(b) Probational communication restrictions enforced for a period no longer than (1) year or attainment of full Agent Nonpareil license and mission-ready status, whichever comes first. Restrictions are subject to Archon fiat and intended to mitigate breach risks from a more culturally entrenched individual than is typical.

>(c) Mandatory class/powerset selection coaching and forfeiture of class/powerset selection in lieu of potential non-optimal preferences.

>(d) Additional fitness training. The licensed agent requires significant fitness improvement, and will need to surrender the majority of off-time to customized regimens until meeting the proper standards.

>(e) The licensed agent will act as an advocate for Archon with all alien elements (such as those they are already in contact with), where necessary, and refrain from security breaches, improper alien prioritization over Archon interests, or harmful criticism. These refrains are strictly in an ‘out of house’ sense (as though public). Concerns in-house, under standard confidentiality protocols, may be taken up or expressed normally.

Frowning, Jack tapped the pen on the paper and felt his stubborn tendencies rising up into critical. He held up the paper to Alice and pointed. “There, part C. What is that about?”

Alice leaned down, read it, and shrugged. “I’ve seen it before. Potential agents are, regrettably, sometimes a risk for improper value priorities when there are particularly needed roles. Understand, Mr. Laker, this is all for the greater good of humanity.”

“Uh-huh. And how old are most potential agents when they sign one of these?”

She blinked. “Well. Just after puberty. But-”

“And how old am I? Around the same?”

“You know your own age, Mr. Laker.”

“Twenty-five. Twenty-five, a grown-ass man, and I can’t make my own choices? I think whoever drafted this might be a little confused.”

Alice frowned at him, which suddenly felt like he was being exactly the sort of middle school problem child he’d just denied being. But he refused to bow to that externally levered feeling — trusting a deeper dissatisfaction in his gut — and stared right back. Watching her so closely, he noticed her eyes slip just slightly, as if they wanted to glance upward to the side. The corner. The camera.

It was the tiniest flinch, though, and she finally put on a polite smile and replied, “Your situation has been carefully considered, Mr. Laker. You should see that in the outline of the training changes. It is not a factor of simply age or maturity, but a complete profile, including temporary issues of altered perception. This is the result of an assessment and certainly not meant to insult you, nor is there anything to be ashamed of.”

Jack leaned back to give her a level look, then deliberately turned to look at the camera, before turning back to pour over the contract. He read back a page, forward a page, but he was finding it difficult not to simply dwell on the ‘custom rules’ part, and how much the whole thing smelled like a trick. A hoodwink.

*Not hard to pull on younger people, or most families with their eyes turned into the big zeros that were going to get added to the end of their income.* It was something of an open secret that the families of Nons were taken very good care of. There were some rare known families of public figures, and those rumored or expected to be of an unknown one. Ostensibly, it was supposed to be kept secret but it wasn’t ruthlessly upheld. Probably yet another calculated measure.

He turned back to eye the rules again and thought about the ‘B’ part dealing with communication. How would it relate to him and Neex? ‘E’ did show some expectation of communication, but obviously under Memoria’s fiat rules. Just as he — right then, apparently out of contract and limited — couldn’t talk to her and was blocked.

*Well. This is a contract. They need me to sign it. And what if…?*

Jack tossed the pen down on the contract, folded his hands on the table, and smiled politely up at Alice. “I’m not signing this, as it stands. I’m going to need some changes. So. Now what?”

I do it for a few weeks, mostly half-ass it because no results or progress or validation, then i quit.

The only habit i successfully managed to create in my 25 years of existence is going to gym

interesting part is that it wasn't intentional, the habit was engineered into my brain accidentally. And I was hoping you guys could offer some inputs in replicating it for other habits

For 3 years i went on and off to the gym, go for 3 weeks, don't go for next 2 weeks, 2 months in, 3 months out.

until around 1year ago, i started walking to this cafe to get some black coffee before heading to gym

every day the cafe had new people, novelty, after which i headed to gym

over time, it became a habit to visit this cafe for coffee everyday and since i liked it, i never missed a day, and since the gym was near the cafe, i automatically went to the gym after as i wore gym clothes and took workout gears to the cafe.

so the cue forced me to stay at the task everyday until i saw visible progress in the gym and now my ADHD brain makes me hit the gym automatically at 7pm every. single. day.

I also enjoy being watched and since i could lift better, even more reason to stay in there.

I need to apply this habit to work - i wish to work on my projects on laptop from 10 am - 4 pm everyday - 6hours straight

i tried pomodoro, adding music as cues, and rewarding with food but i am not interested in any of those.

my dopamine triggers include external appreciation, being watched or observed, or validation. I need results and i can proceed.

but for results to happen, you got to stick to the task for at least 1-2 months every single day. I need some cue like the cafe here to do this 4-6 hour sessions everyday until it becomes a habit or until there is a visible result in what i do.

I 25F am 1,63m tall and started at 77kg about two months ago, and I'm barely down to 74.6kg now. I'm really struggling with the acid reflux side effect. I already had GERD prior to Ozempic, I am on 80mg of Ezomeprazole daily for it. I'm having at most one meal a day, but no matter what I eat I spend the rest of the day with horrifying acid reflux. I can't afford to go higher with the dose, and frankly the side effect of even more reflux than usual is killing me. I'm very frustrated TBH, I'm getting married in November and I just want to be beautiful for one day in my whole life, but I'm barely loosing any weight at all despite working out really hard and having only one small meal a day. Before I just quit Ozempic entirely, in anyone on any specific diet that seems to help? I have cut out coffee, tea, soda, cítrics, condiments, tomatoes, onions, garlic, dairy, any flour (all kinds) and sugar, the usual GERD diet. I'm also not eating anything after 4pm and I sleep on a special GERD pillow but none of that seems to help. It gets way worse right before my period for some reason. Should I just quit?

I gave him a disclaimer that I’ve just started my period and am just probably getting into my own head - but that I felt like he had clicked off his social media quickly when we were in the room together that day. 

We’ve had issues with me feeling insecure and unsure in the past, mostly because I had a tough upbringing with the men in my life and past relationships. He doesn’t like when I express uncertainty to him because he says he wants to feel trusted. He also says that me not feeling trusting has led him to do things like hangout at his female coworker’s house for a bonfire without telling me before hand and showing up at home at 4 am, (I had expressed to him that I’d feel more comfortable hanging out with her and him together before I’d be able to say I’m okay with them hanging out one on one). 

Also, he slept over at a female friends house one night when he was upset with me for not being comfortable with him going over to her house at night after he had just told me that my insecurities bother him. 

Another time he had told me he was going to go hangout with a guy friend when I looked on his phone and he hadn’t even messaged the guy friend but had plans to hangout with a female friend of his. He told me that he still was going to reach out to the guy friend but that he didn’t want to say that it was the female friend off the bat because I might ask him questions he doesn’t feel like answering. 

Anyways, we had just recently had a deep conversation about how I will not accept him blowing up angrily at me anymore and cussing at me etc. . He expressed to me how he’s very remorseful for not controlling his emotions more and that it’s never his intention to be that way. He’s often very kind but he definitely has a temper. 

So I asked him tonight if his phone is private to him or if he feels like it’s something that I’m welcome to be on. If there’s anything on there that he wouldn’t want me to see, or if he’s been discussing anything that he wouldn’t want me to read. I understand that I *should* have this basic trust in him, and I do believe that he is faithful, but sometimes these fears creep up on me and I feel like I need to speak on them and ask for reassurance. 

He called me selfish for asking him before he has to leave for work, he called me an unhelpful partner (how come I didn’t help him make himself lunch before work, yet I have time to make his day harder with heavy questions)? Which, I get it now that it was probably bad timing but I had been up since 3 am to go to work myself and spent the rest of our day taking care of our daughters. He was home all day, why should I have to make his lunch for him for me to be a helpful partner? He says I pick and choose what I do to be a helpful partner. 

I told him that I just want a partner whom I can safely communicate my worries to even when I’m just getting into my own head. He said he’s tired of going over this BS over and over again but almost every time I bring it up he shuts it down like this so I never really feel concluded. I felt he was unkind and harsh with me, even though I was already in tears telling him that I shouldn’t have brought it up in that way/at that time. He continued to blame me for being the reason he now has to go to work upset or not show up at all. 

What really got me what the fact that not even a week ago he had gotten angry with me when we were supposed to be on a coffee date before I left for work over my mom having his Xbox passcode. I had to spend the first half of my day fighting back tears from what he said. But now he is so upset that I would bring this up before he has to leave for work. It felt like a double standard to me and I hadn’t even said I thought he was cheating just that I felt emotional over the possibility that he could hide something from me.

A few hours later we matched, and she was flirty, calling me handsome etc and we were going back and forth. We were talking about what we were looking for on hinge and I said nothing serious, just something casual/fun over the summer while I'm on a break from school. And she said she was looking for something similar and that we're ""on the same page ;)"". So we didn't flat out say it, but it was undeniable the two of us were communicating that we were DTF.

So we agreed on a day to meet up for coffee/drinks. I told her I'd look up some places and let her know. However, I was unfamiliar with the city, and was struggling to find a good place that isn't starbucks. And although a big part of me thought the idea was hot, a small rational part of me was saying ""dude whats wrong with you, she's twice your age!"". I also know a lot of people that live in that area and was low key paranoid about being seen with her (because of the taboo age gap thing etc). As the day got closer and not being able to make a solid plan, I chickened out and unmatched her without saying anything like a bitch.

Anyways, part of me is glad I didn't go through with it. I've never really done a FWB type of thing and I've never been that type of person, especially with an older woman. But another part of me always regretted it too, wondering how it would've been lol. 2 years later, I think about it still. I've started taking salsa classes and there are a lot of attractive older women there too, and lately its gotten be thinking about the lady from Hinge. 

So I looked, her profile is still there, new photos/prompts etc so she's still active. Lately, I've been feeling like trying it out again. Maybe just straight up telling her that I chickened out but I'm ready to try it again if she's down lol. But then, I still have the same fears from two years ago. So I don't want to waste anyones time and want to make sure that if I DO reach out, I actually follow through with it.

Mondays... We've All Been There! 😴  
Ah, Monday. That familiar feeling of the weekend slipping away and the weight of the week looming. We get it! It's okay to feel a little draggy after a good weekend.  
But here's the thing: you've got this! 💪 You just spent a couple of days doing things you love, recharging your batteries, and filling your cup. Tap into that positive energy!  
Think of it like this: the weekend was like a supercharged battery pack for your soul. Now, let's use that power to tackle the week! 🚀  
Here are a few tips to get you started:  
\* Start small: Don't try to conquer the whole week at once. Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.  
\* Reward yourself: Plan a small reward for getting through the day. It could be anything from a cup of coffee to a few minutes of meditation.  
\* Remember your weekend wins: Take a moment to reflect on the positive experiences you had over the weekend. Let those good vibes fuel your Monday.

1jysihi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jysihi/i_23f_want_to_reach_out_to_an_old_flame_26m_after/,"I (23F) want to reach out to an old flame (26M) after 4 years for closure, even though he might be in a relationship?","Hi Reddit,

  
I (23F) need some advice on something that’s been sitting on my heart for a long time.

About 4 years ago, I had a brief but incredibly intense connection with a guy I met in my hometown. We only talked for a few months, but it was the kind of connection that stays with you. We clicked right away! same humor, deep conversations, constant texting, long walks, dates, and genuinely sweet moments. There were kisses, laughter, teasing, and warmth. It felt real and mutual. I genuinely started falling for him.

Then, suddenly, things shifted. He became distant. He went from texting daily to disappearing for days, eventually telling me he “chose to leave” and didn’t want something serious. It was so abrupt that I never truly understood why or what changed. I never got closure. Just silence.

Don't get this wrong, he is actually a good guy, not a player who goes around hurting girls, he had some problems to deal with, but I admit that he did not handle this the correct way and really hurt me by leaving like this, it's a very deep scar I carry around to this day.

I moved cities for school shortly after, started a new chapter of my life, and even entered a long-term relationship (which turned out to be toxic and draining). That’s now over. But this guy—this *first one*—has stayed on my mind for years. I’ve dreamt about him randomly, thought of him during quiet moments, and have always carried the weight of everything that was left unsaid between us.

A couple of years after things ended, I ran into him unexpectedly at a bar. We spoke briefly, caught up, and even hugged. He was kind, and it brought back all the emotions, I was truly happy to see him again, and sad about how things turned out to be. Since then, I’ve seen him once or twice—always casually, always in public. He always says hi casually, we have a small talk conversation and then we go our separate ways. He seemed to be in a relationship during those sightings, I saw him with his girlfriend once, they looked intimate, she was laying on his shoulder, laughing etc, he said hi to me, and I’ve never said anything. Whenever we meet, he acts casual and indifferent, but he always says hi and hugs me, like i'm just another ""friend"" he met, not someone he had something with and it always bothers me ! Yes, it's been 4 years, yes, we only had a thing for 3 months but were never official, but why do I still cherich that memory ? why was he that special to me and I was not to him ?

Now I’m back living in the same city, and I still feel this deep, unresolved energy about it all. I’m not looking to start anything or ruin anyone’s relationship. I just really want a chance to talk to him—just once—to ask some questions, to understand what happened, and maybe finally let go for real. I’ve grown a lot since then, and I don’t want to carry this “what if” forever.

I could never forget him, and I truly want to reach out and meet him again, I don't know where he lives, but I know where he works, and I only have his old number that he probably changed, not sure. The problem is I'm not sure if he is still with his girlfriend, and I think I have no way to find out, I have done a lot of stalking on socials and could not find signs of them being together, nor broken up. 

I have him on Instagram (we still follow each other), and I know the general area he works at, and he occasionally posts at spots around the city. I last saw him with her last summer, 8 months ago, and he is not the type to post his girlfriend, but they still follow each other. I don't know how I can kow if he has a girlfriend or not, because if he does, that would make it difficult, as I truly don't want to cause them drama or look like I want to break their couple.

I’m torn between just messaging him casually to ask for a coffee and feeling like it might be too much, especially if he’s still with someone. 



**So my questions are:**

* How can I know if he still has a girlfriend ? I need smart ways, and not like ""ask him from another number"", or the classical ways, I need a great idea that would give me my answer without being caught.
* Is it worth it after 4 years ? i'm afraid I was nothing for him and would be treated as a burden if I talk, and maybe he would laugh at me about this, even tho he is actually a good person.
* I always think that this is an unhealthy obsession, but they are also my feelings, what do you think ?
* If he turns out to have a girlfriend, is there a way for me talk about this without me causing trouble for him or the girl ? Believe me, as much as I truly like him and want to talk to him, I have no intention of breaking the couple nor hurting the girl, I just feel like I need my closure and have a lot of unsaid things between us, and would love to talk and have a conversation about it. 

I’m not expecting a fairytale or a reunion, even if I would love to. 

But again, I only want to talk about what happened, know his side of the story, and get my closure. 

I want to know if I ever crossed his mind after, was I just a distraction he entertained because he was bored, and if my feelings are valid, because sometimes I feel crazy. But I truly need this, and feel like If I don't, I'll carry these emotions with me many other years, I'm the type who can never move on without a closure !

It's maybe too late and probably would make him feel very creeped out to see that someone he only knew for some months still has all these feelings for him, but I feel like I truly need it to move on, I just want to stop carrying this emotional weight that’s been with me since I was 19, it has been really hurtful.

Any advice or similar experiences would mean the world ! Thank you guys !

I was sitting on the couch with my feet on the coffee table, with my girlfriend at the time.  I saw something out of the corner of my eye and looked down at my feet on the table.  A thick, white smoke was coming out of the end of my foot, you know how a cigarettes smoke behaves, almost exactly the same consistency as well.  Anyways, it collected into a oblong circle shape and then just POOF it was gone.  It lasted all in all probably 15 seconds.

1jyse4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/WebDesignHive/comments/1jyse4s/american_wordpress_website_developer_in_florida/,American WordPress Website Developer in Florida: The Complete Guide,"The WordPress development landscape in Florida has evolved dramatically over the past decade. From Miami's bustling tech scene to Tampa's growing digital community, WordPress developers across the Sunshine State are creating innovative digital solutions tailored to local businesses. As of early 2025, Florida hosts over 7,500 active WordPress professionals ranging from solo freelancers to established agencies.

Local developers have become increasingly valuable for Florida businesses seeking to establish meaningful online presences that reflect regional nuances and address specific market needs. When a tourism operator in Key West or a healthcare provider in Orlando needs a website that truly connects with their audience, having a developer who understands the local context makes all the difference.

According to recent market research, WordPress powers approximately 43% of all websites in the United States, with Florida businesses adopting the platform at an even higher rate—nearly 47% of Florida-based websites use WordPress. This prevalence creates a thriving ecosystem for developers who specialize in this versatile content management system.

#  <<< [Professional WordPress Solutions | ⚡ Start Your Free Consultation Today](https://coderlift.com/services/wordpress-development/) >>>

# The Florida Web Development Scene

Florida's web development landscape is uniquely positioned at the intersection of tourism, retirement communities, international business, and emerging technology. Currently, the state boasts over 450 web development companies with a significant concentration in South Florida, Tampa Bay, and the Orlando corridor.

Unlike traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley or New York City, Florida's development community is more distributed across multiple cities and serves a more diverse set of industries. While Silicon Valley focuses heavily on startups and enterprise solutions, Florida developers often specialize in tourism, real estate, healthcare, and small business applications.

What truly sets Florida apart is its combination of geographical advantages and industry specialization. Developers here have cultivated expertise in multilingual websites (particularly English/Spanish), hurricane-resistant hosting solutions, and seasonal business adaptations. Additionally, the lower cost of operations compared to other tech centers has allowed many Florida WordPress agencies to offer competitive pricing while maintaining high-quality output.

# Why Choose a Florida-Based WordPress Developer

Working with a local Florida WordPress developer offers tangible benefits that remote or out-of-state developers simply can't match. Local developers bring an intuitive understanding of Florida's diverse markets—they know that a website for Naples customers might require a completely different approach than one targeting Miami Beach or Orlando visitors.

This regional expertise extends to understanding business patterns unique to Florida, such as seasonal tourist influxes, snowbird populations, and weather-related business considerations. A Florida developer knows that your website needs to perform flawlessly during peak season and may suggest strategic updates during slower months.

The convenience of sharing a timezone cannot be overstated. When urgent updates are needed—perhaps due to a sudden tropical storm warning affecting your business operations—having a developer who's available during your business hours is invaluable. Face-to-face meetings, whether at your office or a local coffee shop, foster clearer communication and stronger working relationships that ultimately lead to better websites.

Florida developers also navigate the state's specific business regulations with ease. From tourism licensing requirements to Florida-specific privacy considerations, local developers have encountered these challenges before and can build websites that maintain compliance while achieving business goals.

# Services Offered by Florida WordPress Developers

# Custom WordPress Website Development

Florida WordPress developers excel at creating custom solutions beyond basic templates. These tailored websites incorporate regional design aesthetics, functionality specific to Florida markets, and optimizations for local users.

# FAQs

# Common Questions About Hiring WordPress Developers in Florida

**Q: Do I need a Florida-based developer if my business serves customers nationally?**

A: While not strictly necessary, a Florida-based developer brings valuable insights into whether your business has physical locations in Florida or if a significant portion of your customers are in the state. Their understanding of local search patterns, regional preferences, and business regulations can provide advantages even for businesses with national reach.

**Q: How does hurricane season affect website development timelines?**

A: Experienced Florida developers build hurricane season considerations into their project timelines. Most avoid scheduling critical launches or major updates during peak hurricane season (August-October) and build extra buffer time into projects that span these months. Additionally, they implement more frequent backup points during development during hurricane season.

**Q: Can Florida developers effectively serve businesses in specific regions like the Panhandle or the Keys?**

A: While many WordPress developers can serve clients statewide, there are regional differences within Florida that might make a local developer more effective. The business environment in Miami differs significantly from Pensacola or Key West. For businesses deeply embedded in specific local markets, a developer familiar with that particular region may provide additional value.

# Pricing Concerns

**Q: Why do WordPress development costs vary so much among Florida developers?**

A: Price variations typically reflect differences in expertise, specialization, and service depth. Factors affecting pricing include:

* Agency size and overhead costs
* Specialized industry knowledge (tourism expertise commands premium rates)
* Technical specialization (e-commerce or custom application development)
* Support and maintenance offerings
* Geographic location within Florida (Miami and Naples typically have higher rates than smaller markets)

* Progress payments at key project milestones
* Final payment prior to or upon launch Maintenance agreements are typically billed monthly or quarterly, often with discounts for annual prepayment.

# Timeline Expectations

**Q: How long does a typical WordPress website development project take in Florida?**

**Q: When should I start a website project to launch before Florida's peak tourist season?**

A: For tourism-related businesses, plan to start development at least 3-4 months before your intended launch date. Ideally, major website launches or redesigns should be completed during shoulder seasons—April/May or September/October—allowing time to resolve any issues before peak visitor periods.

**Q: How quickly can emergency updates be implemented during crisis situations?**

A: Reputable Florida WordPress developers maintain emergency response capabilities for situations like hurricane warnings, red tide alerts, or other regional events affecting their clients.

I’m writing this not to change your mind, not to chase after something you’ve already asked to step away from but to express ang mga bagay na dapat nasabi ko sayo pero di ko na nasabi

It’s been days (mag 2 weeks na sa Thursday) since nag message ka, and paulit ulit kong binabasa. Hindi ko na din alam kung bakit. I’ve held on to your words because they came from a place of honesty, and I respect that, truly. Choosing to heal alone takes strength, and I want you to know na sinusuportahan ko at nir'respeto ko ang desisyon mo, even if it hurts on my end. Your peace is important, and if distance is part of how you find that, then I want you to have it.

But in the quiet moments, when I miss your voice, paulit ulit kong pinapakinggan yung mga voice messages mo. tapos naalala ko yung mga times na kung paano mo ako tignan, like I was worth seeing. Everytime na may napupuntahan akong bagong coffee shop na may magandang view, ikaw kaagad ang naiisip ko. Palaging may thought na ""*Mas masaya siguro kung kasama ko si N... kasi gustung gusto nya ng mga ganitong lugar.*"" 

I can’t help but feel the weight of what could’ve been if nagkakilala tayo na fully healed ka na. siguro nag p'plano na tayo kung saan tayo mag c'car camping. I still carry the memory of our breakfast and dinner date, the songs I promised to sing, the camping trip we never took. I remember how you told me your ideal day was us cooking together (yung Pork Sinigang na iluluto mo dapat sakin), eating chips, siopao then p'parter-an mo ng favorite mong Mogu-Mogu sa kwarto lang habang mag N'Netflix and just being simple and soft. I imagined and wanted to do life with you, even on the mundane days. And maybe that’s the reason kung bakit mahirap sa akin ang lahat kahit na what we had only lasted about a week. Because it wasn’t just the idea of you I fell for, it was who you really were.

Maybe we were the right people at the wrong time. nagkakilala tayo while you were still carrying the weight of your past, still healing from the pain you never deserved. naiintindihan ko na, no matter how much I wanted to hold your hand through that healing, it wasn’t mine to fix. You needed to walk that road on your own. I get that now. And I respect it.

I don’t know if I’ll ever feel this kind of connection again. You made me feel seen, like I was enough as I was. hindi ko na kailangan magpaka try hard na magpa impress sayo. nakikita mo yung pure na ako and you still chose to embrace it wholeheartedly. at dahil sayo, nagsisikap ako na iimprove yung sarili ko at nagugustuhan ko yung version ng sarili ko kapag magkasama / magkausap tayo. That’s something I’ll always be grateful for, no matter where life takes us.

So this letter… hindi ito request na bumalik ka na, agad agad. It’s just my way of telling you that you mattered. You still do. And habang binibigay ko yung space na hiningi mo, I want you to know na if ever you find yourself healed, buo na ulit and looking back—if our paths ever align again—I’ll still believe in what we could be.

Until then, take all the time you need. Take care of yourself. ingatan mo ang puso mo, nag iisa lang yan. wag na wag mong hayaan na masira ulit yan. hindi man ako ang makakapag bigay pero deserve nyan ng totoong pagmamahal

1jysbdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1jysbdb/too_hungover_to_open_the_store_and_use_me_as_your/,Too hungover to open the store and use me as your stand in manager? Not my problem goodbye!,"So story is based on my retail days. Now I told the story of how I became a retail consultant [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1juz6sk/steal_my_commission_fine_enjoy_doing_my_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This happened after I sorted out my  college Uselesso and moved on to supervising managers.

So retail can be a hot mess at times. This hot can be compounded by incompetent and just useless managers.

This story takes place **6 months after** the Uselesso incident.

So I was told by corporate to help / advise / keep tabs ( insert jargon here) of a manager called **Donovan.** Again he is called Donovan because that's his actual name.  Now Donovan was just clueless as a manager. He didn't know his earhole from his arsehole and couldn't distinguish between a profit or a loss let alone what profit margin was. He also hated me because of my job and what my position was. If you read the previous story, I forgot to mention that he was the one who signed over my commission to Uselesso as a sales manager. He got reprimanded for that which pushed back his Store manager promotion by a few months. He didn't like me very much.

Now the issue that I had to help with or observe , was the fact that the stores turnover on Tuesdays was very low. For example when stores were making $10000 daily targets, this store was making $3000 daily dollar targets.  So I get told to come in on the Mondays and see what is happening. Now Mondays is where sales people prep the store for the weekly sale which runs Tuesday to Monday the following week. So it was the opening day of sales basically.

I arrive at 7:30am on Monday expecting the store to be open for employees to set up for the day ( Customer hours started from 8:30. Dunnowherevan is nowhere to be found. I message and call him. Nothing. It hits 8:30.... nothing... at 9 he opens the store looking worse for where. Basically he just opens the store, ignores customers and just tells everyone to get to work... No briefing no nothing. He doesn't greet me.

So basically I spend the time helping the salespeople and figuring out what they have to do. The poor sales people are freaking out. One guy even quit on the spot ( understandable). So I jump in. I guess my gaming and coffee session will have to wait.  
I help them change prices, shift displays, hell I even dealt with yelling Karen's. All this is happening while DunnoWhereVan is passed out in the office.

Now Monday is critical as the store launched sales on Tuesdays. Managers always brief sales people on price changes, how to set up displays etc. So as I am helping doing this, the regional manager ( RM) comes in. He and I have a very frosty relationship ( another story for another day).   This is 12pm. Like 3 hours after opening.

RM demands to know why I am doing this. To be fair I bluntly told him that I am trying to help the sales people set up for the upcoming sale and DunnoWhereVan is "" busy in his office"".

The RM storms into DunnoWhereVans office and fireworks flew. Basically RM saw that DunnoWhereVan was hungover and not doing his job.

I report my findings to RM and he tells me to finish helping out until 2pm ( my contracted hours). He weirdly thanks me profusely ( RM doesn't usually thank people ).

I finish up and go home.

This is where the petty revenge comes in. DunnoWhereVan says he gave me the job because he signed off my commission to Uselesso and ""helped me set myself up"" as a consultant. So basically he tried to throw me under the corporate train because he wasn't doing his job.

Now Donovan was also hungover and was like this every Monday. He thought that he could get me to do his job for a couple of weeks while he could have some blowout weekends with the boys.

After a long legal process, DunnoWhereVan was fired. He even had the gall to ask me for a job!

TLDR: Dude where's Donovan?

1jys7ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/aistory/comments/1jys7ww/the_devils_retainer/,The Devil's Retainer,"When bad things happened—war, famine, pop-up ads—the Devil got blamed.

It didn’t matter that humankind had taken the wheel long ago and was doing donuts in the parking lot of moral ambiguity. Lucifer still got the Yelp reviews. One star. “Summoned him once, ended up with three ex-wives and a gluten allergy. Would not recommend.”

Tired of being the universal scapegoat, Satan hired a lawyer.

And not just any lawyer.

Leonard P. Bramble, Esq., had defended pharmaceutical companies, reality TV stars, and once, a haunted mattress. His business card simply read: “Leonard Bramble – If You’re Evil, I’m Legal.”

Lucifer met him in a café that smelled of scorched coffee beans and broken dreams.

“I need someone to represent me,” the Devil said, stirring his espresso with a fiery finger. “Every time a child trips on a LEGO or someone runs for political office, it’s somehow my fault.”

Bramble adjusted his tie, which was the color of an overdue tax bill. “Classic defamation. We’ll countersue humanity. Maybe God too. He's overdue for a deposition.”

The Devil grinned. “Excellent. I’ll pay you handsomely.”

Bramble arched a brow. “Let’s see the contract.”

Lucifer slid a crimson scroll across the table. “Standard demonic retainer. I own your soul when the job’s done.”

Bramble didn’t flinch. “I once signed a lease on a timeshare in New Jersey. I’ve seen worse.”

They shook hands, causing a small earthquake in Ohio.

Within weeks, Bramble had rebranded the Devil.

“No longer Prince of Darkness. He’s now The Uninvolved Observer of Human Choices™,” Bramble told the press.

He ran a PR campaign: “Don’t Blame Satan—You Bought the AR-15 Yourself.” He aired infomercials where the Devil wept into a handkerchief, saying, “I didn’t tell you to text your ex at 2 a.m.”

Public opinion shifted. CNN ran a poll. “Do you believe the Devil is just misunderstood?” 64% said yes. 12% said “Wait, is this about the IRS?”

Lucifer was overjoyed. “You’ve done it, Bramble. My name is cleared.”

“Just doing my job,” Bramble said. “Now, about the payment.”

Lucifer’s grin returned. “Yes. Your soul.”

But Bramble pulled out a second scroll.

“I amended the contract,” he said smoothly. “Standard legalese: ‘In the event the client is a supernatural being, the lawyer's soul shall be considered off-limits in perpetuity, unless forfeited voluntarily in writing and notarized by a neutral third-party cherub.’”

The Devil blinked. “You… edited my contract?”

“I’m a lawyer,” Bramble said. “Editing contracts is how I summon rent.”

Lucifer looked annoyed. “Fine. You keep your soul. But I will see you in Hell eventually.”

“Oh, I already lease an office there,” Bramble replied. “Great view of the Lake of Fire. No HOA fees.”

And with that, he strolled out, briefcase in hand, leaving behind a Devil who—for the first time—felt like he’d been out-deviled.

Was walking an average of 17k steps a day over the 3 days due to my work along with resistance training.",12,1744611455.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False
1jys4j5,https://i.redd.it/7xz3knjitque1.jpeg,Cleaning Pixie (black stuff in water),"I have a 10+ year old Pixie machine. When I run a cycle with no pod in it, it is constantly letting out black specks, which I am assuming at best are old coffee grinds. I have run multiple cycles of running both water and the cleaning agent through the flushing cycle (where it just runs non-stop until you turn it off),
 and have run hot water directly through the nozzle of the Pixie, but no matter what I do, small black particles continue to come out. Any idea how to clean this?  Do I need to dismantle and do a deep clean?",3,1744611439.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False
