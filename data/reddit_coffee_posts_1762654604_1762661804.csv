1os9n5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somalia/comments/1os9n5r/why_omar_fateh_losing_is_a_good_thing_and_what_we/,Why Omar Fateh losing is a good thing and what we can learn from it,"PSA:

This is going to be a semi long read, so take your time. This is all just my personal opinion, research, and ideas. I do not live in Minnesota, but after following this election for a couple of months, watching segments of the debates, I can say we dodged a bullet with him. I am an up and coming researcher, so I want to share my insight on this issue. 

A lot of this may come as harsh, and rude, and hating, but I’d rather say what nobody wants to say. I spent two hours writing this report, and used an ample amount of information/sources to help me with this. A little bit of background of myself, I am not a politician or law major, I did a tech degree. Let us begin shall we.



Background:

As we all know our fellow Somali Omar Fateh lost the election to incumbent Jacob Frey. A lot of people in our community are upset at this defeat and believe the reason why he lost is due to clan politics and whatever other reason. I will be explaining why that is wrong in these segments: the Somali Identity, the Policies, the Campaign Trail, Ilhan Omar, If He Won, and what we can learn from this.



ICE:

Omar Fateh said if ICE were to come into Minneapolis he would arrest those wearing face masks and stop them from sharing information with them. I’m sorry, what? ICE is a federal government agency and has more authority over local governments on immigration. This isn’t debatable and is the protocol for every state. You cannot be a mayor and directly go against the federal government like that. It’s not productive, and it’s much safer to cooperate and collaborate and share the issues he has with them instead of outright campaigning against them. Bad move.



Police:

He said he would shift funding from the law enforcement into other social workers. The police force is already underfunded and struggles to even staff people in that job. There are countless organizations that money could be divested from to fund social workers instead of cutting money to police who are already stretched thin. Don’t believe me? Vibrant Store & Cultural District gets $1 million dollar+ annually. Interesting.

Addressing Clan Dispute: 

This next portion can be a report on its own so I’ll try to keep it brief. I've seen many people say, “Omar Fateh lost because he was so and so clan”. Wrong. This is just a sad excuse to blame Somali people for his defeat. Even so, why should I vote for someone who holds the same ethnicity as me, but not the same values as I? That’s not productive. We live in America and regardless if someone comes from the same background as me, I am not going to automatically support you. Somali people are not obligated to vote for him just because he’s Somali. That’s a backwards way of thinking. Plus he got 65k people to vote for him; they’re not all Somali. Not to mention he supported other non Somalis on his way to the top.



Policies:

His policies flat out weren’t that good. For example, $20 minimum wage. Imagine opening up a restaurant and without even making a single sale, you have to pay your employees $20 an hour. That’s absurd. A 16 year old across the entire United States gets paid $9 - $13 dollars an hour, that's almost double the cost. Companies will not flock to Minnesota when you have to pay even the Janitor $20 an hour to do unskilled labor. A $5 coffee would have to be at least $8 to cover the margin. That’s not fighting inflation, that’s contributing to it.

Then he wants to freeze rent. How will landlords be able to fix and maintain properties when they themselves are having to fight against rising costs? They will simply leave and just abandon properties because it’s too expensive to manage.



Campaign Trail: 

His campaign wasn’t that strong. Why on Earth is this guy waving Somali state flags when running for mayor? I’ve written about this before on a different sub, but my points still stand. He knows that the media is out to get him for a multitude of reasons and he STILL decided to do that. Over 200k pepole were talking about that on twitter. What was he thinking?

His campaign managers are jokes. Baddies for Omar? Seriously? You’re running for mayor not prom king. He also isn’t a strong speaker and often says um um um a lot of the time he's speaking. He doesn’t even sound like he believes in half of the stuff he’s talking about. America is a capitalist country, and they already don’t view Somalis in a positive light, so imagine combining Socialist and Somali.

Ilhan:

The Ilhan Omar endorsement. Foolish mistake. Ilhan herself already betrayed the Somali countless times that I don’t even need to explain. As soon as she won her votes and got support from the Somali community she completely backstabbed us but gave us soooo much negative attention. She is constantly making comments and talks as if she’s a highly educated and is a graduate of an ivy league school. She talks as if she discovered the cure to cancer and actively provokes people in government.

Whether you all like it or not, THEY WILL ATTACK SOMALIA/SOMALIS. You can literally look at many political commentators on twitter or instagram or whatever and they’re always talking about how she did and that she should be deported. She has done nothing but bad for the community and made the extreme right and others target us for the littlest of things. The fact that Fateh using her as an endorsement was ever a good idea is hilarious hence why I said her campaign managers failed her.



If He Won: 

If he had won the mayoral race, and god forbid, something bad happened to Minneapolis, we all know who they will blame. They won’t blame the people who voted for those who aren’t Somali, WE WILL GET THE BLAME FOR IT. “Look at those Somalis, they elected their own mayor and now this event has happened.” I mean they already do take a look at every political space, every minor issue with the entire state of Minnesota gets blamed on us so just think what would happen if we had a Somali one. We get blamed for issues in Europe, America, Kenya and the list goes on. Mind you, we are a global minority, and even more so in the west and we already have this much influence. That’s an accomplishment in itself.

Conclusion and What We Can Learn From This:

Overall, I think he did pretty well for the first time if you ask me, but far too many people are too concerned that he is Somali and not his politics. I just hope the next Somali who decides to run for mayor decides to learn from Omar’s mistakes. Hopefully I cleared some doubt in peoples mind. Please if you have any issue with what I said leave a comment or DM me I want to  know where and why I made a mistake. If you made it this far, I just want to say thank you for reading this. I just don’t think he was cut out for this. He’s a very smart guy and hard working. I wish him well but I just don’t think he would really benefit us that much. I’d love to see a Somali mayor one day but more charismatic and with better policies. Thank you all!

All I wanted was to drive straight into their venue and kill us all.
I was about to floor it when my phone wouldn't stop buzzing.
I picked up. It's the hospital.
""Miss Kingston, you're pregnant.""
I killed the engine. Froze.
Thirty minutes later, I started the car again. 
But this time, I turned around and drove straight to the airport.
Just like that, the fake heiress everyone wanted gone vanished from New York.
I fled to Austin, a thousand miles away. 
Almost died having my baby girl. But we made it.
And never talked to any of them again.
Not until four years later, when they all came crawling back.

Four years later, I ran into Cade Sullivan picking up kids from school.

I'd just gotten Maya when another mom came over.

""Oh my god, Maya's mom, look—that guy across the street. Isn't he that singer? God, what's his name again...""

I looked where she was pointing and stopped dead.

""Cade!"" She snapped her fingers. ""That's him!""

I looked away. ""Never heard of him.""

She stared at me. ""Wait, you don't listen to music? Cade! He's been huge the past few years—singer-songwriter, tons of awards!""

She leaned closer, squinting at me. ""Actually... you two kind of look alike. Both gorgeous...""

I smiled and shook my head, taking Maya's hand as we kept walking.

But then I heard his voice behind me.

""Sasha.""

I didn't stop.

""Sasha Kingston!""

Maya looked up. ""Mommy, is that man calling you? Why's he saying Sasha Kingston?""

I shook my head. ""Wrong person, sweetie.""

But when we got to the parking lot and I reached for the car door, someone grabbed my arm.

I turned around—

Cade, out of breath.

""Sasha, you... you're actually alive?""

Same old Cade. Still a total asshole.

Maybe he'd run too fast, because his eyes were red.

I dropped Maya off with the neighbor.

When I came back down, Cade was standing there with his hands in his pockets.

""Why are you living in this shithole? Where's your place? I'm coming up.""

I shook my head. ""Don't bother.""

Four years ago, he made it pretty clear—his only sister was Ivy Sullivan.

He also made it clear that calling me his sister made him sick.

When Garrett Kingston kicked me out, when Rhys Callahan dumped me, when I had nowhere to go, I thought about asking my actual brother for help.

I stood outside his office all night in a snowstorm. Nearly froze to death.

What did I get? Him telling me he wished I'd never been born.

""If you didn't exist, Ivy wouldn't have been switched at birth. She wouldn't have suffered.""

""Sister? That's hilarious. The Kingstons don't want you, so now you're trying to guilt-trip me?""

""I'd never call someone like you my sister.""

That's when I got it—didn't matter how good I was to him. He hated me because of Ivy.

Now he was staring at me with that same look.

""That kid... she's Rhys's, right? You ran off to have his baby?""

I didn't say anything for a second. ""She's my daughter. Mine.""

He smirked. ""Come on, Sasha, that kid's a carbon copy of him. You think I'm blind?""

""Wait, did you really think having his baby would make him come back to you? That's some delusional romantic nonsense...""

""It's pathetic. Absolutely pathetic...""

""I said she's my daughter. Mine."" I cut him off.

""I never planned on going back to New York. Never planned on using my kid to steal Rhys from your precious Ivy. So relax. And quit coming at me like this.""

""Like you said back then—we share blood, that's it. We're strangers. I don't care about your life, so don't try to run mine.""

He just stared at me.

""If that's all, leave.""

""Wait."" He grabbed my arm again.

Opened his mouth. Then closed.

""You... you...""

I frowned. ""What?""

""Why'd you even leave back then...""

I just looked at him.

""You were this spoiled rich girl who couldn't do anything. So people talked sh//it about you—big deal. Why'd you have to run off and do this whole single-mom thing?""

""If I hadn't found you, how long were you gonna keep living like this? And these past four years...""

He stopped.

""H-How'd you even survive?""

I looked at his eyes, red around the edges again.

Probably pissed.

He's probably shocked I'm still breathing. And me being alive? That's a threat to Ivy's perfect life.

How did I survive?

Someone died so I could.

But he doesn't need to know that.

The old Sasha was like some useless hothouse flower.

The new me? I stopped crying on people's shoulders a long time ago.

When I didn't answer, he got more worked up.

""What the HELL, why are you acting so weird now? Did that massive earthquake in Austin a few years back mess up your brain or something?""

""Running off to some middle-of-nowhere place like this—you had an earthquake coming.""

Just then, a neighbor walked by and waved. ""Hey, Wren, haven't started dinner yet?""

I smiled. ""About to.""

Cade froze.

""You should go,"" I said.

But he wouldn't let go of my arm.

""Wait, why'd you change your name? Wren? Did you get married? Whose name is that?""

""None of your business.""

I pulled free, saying it slow so he'd get it.

""What my name is, how I'm doing, Cade—none of your business.""

Cade's a celebrity.

No way he's making a scene in public.

I went upstairs, got Maya, and looked out the window. He was still down there, staring up.

He never cared about me before. His confusion now? Probably just thrown off because I'm not kissing his butt anymore.

Four years ago, after I found out he wanted to be a musician, I used up every connection I had just to get him one shot on stage.

His agency—I'm the one who got him signed.

He's my brother. He'd been through he//ll. I wanted him to do well.

But he twisted all of it, said I was manipulative, trying to make Ivy miserable.

""Mommy, was that man your family?""

I blinked, then smiled and touched her hair. ""No, baby. Why would you think that?""

""Just guessing. You look alike.""

Family?

Garrett's face flashed through my mind.

I used to think no matter what, blood or not, Garrett would always be my brother.

But four years ago, he held Ivy after she ""fell"" down the stairs and looked at me like I was garbage.

""Sasha, you've disappointed me for the last time.""

""Starting today, you're not part of the Kingston family. You're not my sister.""

""My only sister is Ivy.""

I cried, grabbed his leg, begged him not to leave me. Swore I didn't push her.

But he kicked me off and walked away.

I shook my head. ""He's not my family, sweetie.""

She looked sad. ""I thought maybe you had someone besides Uncle.""

I tapped her nose. ""Mommy's got you and Uncle. That's enough.""

""But Uncle's gone..."" Her lip shook. ""I miss him.""

I got it. I really did.

But disappointment? That's better than having something, then losing it.

Better than depending on someone, then having them ripped away.

I'd lived through that. I wasn't letting my daughter go through it too.

Still, I didn't expect it.

The next day, I saw Garrett.

Maya got a fever in the middle of the night.

I took her to the hospital. Bad viral infection—she had to stay for an IV.

By morning, her fever finally broke, but she was wiped. I carried her on my back and stopped at a street vendor on the way home to grab groceries.

I'd just paid when someone took the bags from me—long fingers, sharp knuckles.

I looked up. Through the early fog, I saw Garrett's face.

I was so tired I could barely think. I accidentally called him what I used to.

Then I caught myself. He didn't let me call him that anymore.

The Kingstons? Yeah, I couldn't piss them off.

Four years ago, one sentence from Garrett got me blacklisted everywhere.

""Mr. Kingston,"" I said instead.

I was too busy wondering why he was in Austin to notice how his face went stiff.

""Let me carry this,"" he said quietly.

""I'm good."" I reached for the bags but lost my balance. Maya made a sound on my back.

""Don't push yourself, Sash."" He caught my arm. ""I'll take you both home.""

Sash.

Garrett hadn't called me that in forever.

Our parents were always overseas, so Garrett basically raised me.

When he still saw me as his sister, he spoiled me.

Someone once asked if he worried I'd get him in trouble.

He'd just grinned. ""So what if she does? She wants to cause trouble, let her. Whatever happens, I'll handle it.""

But then Ivy came back.

At first, he still said I'd always be his sister.

But every time Ivy messed with me, he'd tell me to let it go.

""She's been through a lot, Sash. Just give her some space.""

He said we had to make it up to her.

I didn't want to make things hard for him. He'd been my brother for over twenty years. I wanted him happy.

So I gave in. Over and over.

Until he believed Ivy's lies without question, and I finally got it—I saw him as my brother, but he'd stopped seeing me as his sister a long time ago.

And when he took back every bit of care he'd ever given me, when I was drowning and everyone turned on me, that's when I realized how stupid I'd been to depend on him.

We didn't talk the whole ride.

Hadn't been in a car this nice in years. I felt out of place, so I just held Maya close and kept to my side of the seat, trying to figure out why Garrett was even here—

Did Cade tell him?

Was he scared I'd hurt Ivy, so he came to check?

What would he do?

Punish me for having Rhys's kid?

I didn't know. My head was killing me. I held Maya tighter, completely missing how he kept looking at me—like he'd been dying to see me.

""Sash...""

I looked up.

There were new lines around his eyes.

""Four years ago, we all thought you were...""

""Dead. I know."" I cut him off. ""And honestly, you can just keep thinking that. I'm not trying to compete with Ivy. Everything was hers anyway. I'm fine with that. You don't need to be paranoid or check on me. I just want to live quietly with my daughter.""

""And my daughter's staying with me. She's not going to Rhys. I swear I won't use her to mess up Ivy and Rhys. So relax.""

Then I looked him in the eye.

""You can really relax.""

He froze.

""I'm not—""

""Or are you scared I'll use the Kingston name? I won't. I changed my name years ago...""

""Sash!"" He cut me off, voice breaking.

His eyes were red.

""I... I want you to come home...""

I didn't get what Garrett was thinking.

I wasn't part of the Kingston family anymore.

He's the one who said so four years ago.

And what would I even go back for? To be Ivy's punching bag again?

I also didn't get why someone as rich as him had to follow me back to my tiny apartment.

I laid Maya down in bed, then headed to the kitchen. I reached for the instant coffee, then paused—no way someone like him would drink my shitty three-dollar coffee.

So I got him water instead.

He looked down at my right hand. His face did something—I couldn't tell what.

""How's your hand?""

I looked down.

My right hand—my pinky and ring finger didn't move anymore.

It happened after Ivy came back.

We went to tour one of the Kingston factories. She got curious, started talking to an engineer about machinery. To prove her point, she hit the power button on a test device.

My hand was right there.

Before that, I was a rising piano star.

It was the one thing I had over Ivy. I wasn't as smart, wasn't as capable—but piano? That was mine.

When Ivy first came back, every time I practiced, she'd sigh.

""I've always loved music. If I hadn't been switched at birth, I'd be playing piano too.""

But after that day, I couldn't perform anymore.

I spiraled. Didn't want to live.

I was sure she did it on purpose. I hated her for taking my one thing.

Until she tried to kill herself.

After they saved her, I went from victim to villain.

I remember Garrett coming back after seeing her, rubbing his face, exhausted.

""It's just piano, Sash. Just two fingers. Did you really have to push her to this?""

""Even if you can't play, even if you're not my real sister, didn't I say the Kingstons would take care of you? Why are you doing this?""

Cade was colder. ""If you hadn't been switched, Ivy would've been the one playing. You're just giving back what you stole. Why are you throwing a fit?""

They all said my hand would never heal. That crying wouldn't fix it.

But later, at Ivy's party celebrating a patent for the same machine that crushed my fingers, I heard a doctor talking to Garrett.

""I told you back then—if Miss Kingston got treatment abroad right away, she could've recovered most of the function. But you never took her. Now it's too late.""

Garrett's voice was ice-cold. ""It's better this way. Ivy always wanted to learn piano. Seeing Sash unable to play probably makes her feel better.""

""I'll take care of Sash either way. Doesn't matter if she plays or not.""

So my dreams, my future—to him, they were just tools to keep Ivy happy.

When did I start being scared of him?

Probably right then.

""I heard you're teaching music now,"" he said suddenly.

I stiffened, eyes wide.

""I only teach beginner stuff to little kids. Simple music. I don't need my ring finger or pinky for that.""

""I'm not trying to get back on stage. I'd never do anything to upset Ivy. I just need this job to feed my kid. And doctors said my hand's permanently messed up. I'll never play well again. So even if that's true, you still won't let me work?""

He froze. ""Sash, that's not—""

But I wasn't listening anymore.

The fear of having my life destroyed again hit me. I couldn't lose this job because Ivy was unhappy. So I held up my hand, showing him the fingers that wouldn't move.

""Look! I can't play anymore! I gave everything back to the Kingstons!""

""If you don't believe me, go ahead—try to move them. They don't work!""

""I was your sister for years. Can't you just let me survive?""

He jumped up, panicked, and grabbed my shaking shoulders.

""Sash, don't be scared. Please.""

""This time I'll protect you. I swear. Trust me.""

But how could I not be scared?

I'd finally rebuilt my life—the life Kai Wren traded his own for me and Maya.

""NO!""

I shoved him hard.

But the more I fought, the tighter he held me.

1os9j4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1os9j4x/stand_for_small_skil_tablesaw/,Stand For Small Skil Tablesaw,"Hi everyone.  I’m restoring a 1907 house and converting it to a bookstore-coffee shop.  Decided a table saw would be helpful.  I have one, a 240v Delta, but there is no way I am hauling that from my garage to the house and rigging up 240v there.

So I bought a compact portable saw.  A Skil SPT99R-01.  It is the smallest one they make, 8.5” with a roller fence, worm drive, can take a 1/2”dado stack.
 
Now, I’m too old to be cutting on the floor, so I need to come up with a stand or table.  

Skil sell a folding stand, about $99.  Seems very basic.

I could use one of my 4’ folding plastic tables, strap or bolt the saw frame to it.  Cost $0.  Would make it easier to add an outfeed.  
  
What I really want is a Rousseau folding table saw stand, but $500 . . . 

Ideally, I’d like to include a router stand in the piece.  

What would you do?

P.S.  Will be used to make some simple bookcases (1/2” ply, some dadoes and glue, then glue and pins for face frames), make a custom coffee bar for an odd space (frame of salvaged studs from the walls I took out, ply counter, wrap in sheet zinc or copper or something boho-funky), various other projects that are basically rough carpentry-adjacent.  No precision woodworking.  

I can use a track saw to break down full sheets, if doing it single handed with a little table saw is too sketchy.  ",1,1762661019.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

1os9fyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1os9fyg/6_additional_people_living_with_me_and_bpdasd/,6 additional people living with me and BPD/ASD,"Hello, 
I’m 33f and I was diagnosed with ASD in August 2025. I’m still not sure if I believe it because I question more if I have BPD. 

My 6 in-laws (4 children and 2 adults, 1 dog) moved in my single family home (1400 sq ft) with me and my husband in June. 

I am not sure what is going on but maybe it’s ASD or BPD (undiagnosed) meltdowns.

When I come home I absolutely do not want to be perceived and I need my home to be empty. That’s no longer a possibility so I fully isolate in my room for the entire day and I will avoid eating because I don’t want anyone to see me. I do not want to have small talk or pretend in upbeat especially if I had a bad day. I also want to cry freely in my home without anyone asking me if I’m okay. 

I dread being at home because I do not want to talk to them or participate in their activities. I would like to stick to my routines or be alone. 

I’m not looking for solutions or questions on why they live here. I’m looking to hear other people’s stories possibly similar to this or ways to cope when I do not want to be perceived in my home. 

My rigid expectations that are creating my own suffering with this situation: 

I’d like to have my home to myself, I would like it to be quiet, I’d like to be able to cook in my kitchen with no one trying to talk to me or share my kitchen while I am using it. I would like my items to not be used. I do not like any part of my routines being even slightly disrupted by other humans operating in my space (for example, the coffee strength being changed to accommodate the larger family, different cleaners being used that don’t smell good, being mindful of when I do my laundry now, or not being able to leave leave my own messes when I’m exhausted, now having 1 drawer in my fridge). 

The spaces in my home are in constant use in the day. Children glued to TV for 16 hours of the day, the adults using my 2nd living room for most of the day. I am not interested in sharing my living rooms with children if I want to watch tv. 

I feel like my expectations of what I want are too rigid and high so I isolate in my room. Like of course it’s crowded living with this many people and I feel too needy to want my home back or to be constantly alone.  This is why I don’t have kids. Motherhood would kill me. I could do it but be 24/7 burned out.

I cannot verbally utter my boundaries. They will think I’m a rigid, haggard witch. I acknowledge I have to be flexible living with 6 people. My expectations are not achievable at this time in my life. It’s more tolerable to isolate.

I desperately need to turn off but I cannot fully decompress anymore. I am starting not to function well. 

After typing this I realize I need to vent but I also recognize that I’m so rigid and it makes me a difficult human being. I hate it and I hate myself that I’m like this. Maybe I’m just a narcissist.

**Scene 1:**

The **Goenka House** was alive with color, laughter, and life — the first **Holi** since the birth of the newest member of the family, almost a year passed. The garden bloomed with marigolds and music, colors swirling like joy in motion.

On the soft green lawn, **Akshara** sat with Navya in her lap, gently dabbing a touch of pink *gulal* on the little one’s round cheek.  
“Bas thoda sa, meri chhoti si rangoli,” she whispered, her eyes glowing with love.

From behind her came a familiar teasing voice.

“Mumma aur baby dono safe zone mein hain? Ya mujhe attack karna chahiye?”

**Abhimanyu**, armed with a water *pichkari*, grinned mischievously, flanked by **Roohi** and **Abhir**, who were already plotting their next colorful strike.

Akshara shot him a mock glare.

“Abhi, dare you! Tumhe Navya se zyada Holi khelni hai, toh jao Rohan ke saath!”

**Dr. Rohan**, standing nearby with a bowl of colors, raised his hands in surrender.

“Main toh ready hoon, Sir! But honestly, I don’t want to get between this power couple’s color war.”

Everyone laughed. **Roohi** and **Abhir** squealed as they threw colors at **Shivu**, who chased them back with a bucket of water.

Across the lawn, **Aarohi** watched quietly, her smile soft.  Her eyes glistened with affection —for Abhi,  Akshu and the kids, and for the family they had all managed to rebuild together.

 At the edge of the garden, standing a little apart from the laughter, was **Manjari**.  
She watched the scene unfold — her son, her grandchildren, the woman she had once blamed for all his pain — and a complicated emotion flickered across her face. Nostalgia. Regret. And somewhere deep inside… understanding.

 **Scene 2:**

As the laughter gave way to lunch, the festive hum softened. The family gathered around the long dining table. Then, suddenly —  
a sharp, piercing cry broke through the chatter.

‘Navya’.

**Akshara** froze for half a heartbeat before rushing to the crib.

“Kya hua mera bachcha? Shhh… Mumma yahan hai.”

**Aarohi** stepped forward, concern evident.

“Maybe she’s overstimulated, Akshu. Mujhe do, main sambhal leti hoon.”

Akshara nodded, handing the baby over carefully. But the moment **Aarohi** took her, the wailing grew louder — sharper, more desperate. Everyone exchanged worried looks.

Then came **Abhimanyu** — quick, instinctive, and calm.

“Aarohi, please… mujhe de do.”

The baby was back in her father’s arms within seconds. **Abhi** began humming softly — the same lullaby he used to sing to **Roohi** years ago. The melody floated gently through the air, warm and familiar.

Instantly, Navya stopped crying. She curled her tiny fingers around his shirt and sighed, her little face pressing against his chest.

Silence fell. A sacred, tender silence.

**Akshara’s** lips curved into a smile of pride and relief.  
**Roohi** whispered to **Abhir**, “Poppy toh magician hain.”  
**Abhir** nodded, eyes shining. “Dada ke paas superpower hai — love power.”

**Abhimanyu** chuckled, kissing the baby’s forehead.

“Bas, ab sab thik hai.”

From the side, **Manjari** watched, unmoving. The sound of his voice — soft, content, full of peace — echoed in her heart.  
The same son who had once walked around burdened by pain now looked *complete*.

 **Scene 3:**

Evening bathed **Goenka House** in gold. The family had gathered after the **holi** celebration — laughter still drifting through the rooms.

Across the hall, **Manjari** stood watching.

There was **Abhimanyu**, sitting on the couch with Navya in his arms, **Roohi** perched on one side, **Abhir** on the other. His smile was gentle, yet shielded with quiet strength, his eyes never leaving the tiny face that fit so perfectly against his heart. He kissed both **Abhir** and **Roohi** on their foreheads. They giggled and returned the kisses, and Navya — as if understanding — tried to imitate them, pressing her small mouth to his cheek.

For a moment, time stilled.

And then, the truth hit **Manjari** like sunlight breaking through clouds.

Her son didn’t just survive — he healed.

**Abhi was right.**  
Maybe this baby didn’t *need* Abhi… but **Abhi needed this baby**.

For the first time, **Manjari** saw her son not as the boy who once clung to her for strength — but as a man, a father, and a soul reborn.

Her heart ached — not from guilt, but from realization.

For years, she had believed that she was the center of his world, the only one who could protect him from hurt. But now, standing there, she saw it — **his world had changed.**  
It wasn’t only hers anymore. It was this — *his family*, his *children*, *Akshara*.

And Akshara… she wasn’t standing behind him anymore. She was beside him — equal, grounded, steady.

 **Scene 4:**

Later that night, Manjari went to say goodbye to Abhi and Akshara before leaving for Birla house. She followed the soft hum of the lullaby coming from Abhi & Akshu’s room.

**Akshara** was folding tiny clothes. **Abhimanyu** sat nearby, rocking the baby to sleep. The baby, half-asleep, held tightly onto his finger, refusing to let go.

**Akshara (**smiling softly**):** “Lagta hai Dada se zyada koi pyaar nahi karta isko.”

**Abhimanyu (chuckling):** “Bas yahi toh khushi hai, Akshu. Ab sab theek lagta hai.”

Their eyes met — no grand words, no dramatic music — just quiet understanding.

At the door, unseen, **Manjari** stood silently, her eyes welling up. The sight before her wasn’t just love — it was healing. It was peace.

The bitterness she had carried for years slowly melted away.

**Manjari** took a deep breath and knocked - stepped into the room.

**Akshara** and **Abhi** turned, surprised.

**Manjari (**softly, voice trembling)**:**

“Mujhe bahut waqt lag gaya samajhne mein… Abhi ki khushi tum logon ke saath hai.  
Is chhoti si pari ne usse wapas jeena sikha diya hai.  
Aur Akshara… tumne apni galtiyan samajh li, aur Abhi ke dard ko mehsoos kiya.  
Shayad tum dono ne mujhe bhi badalne ka mauka diya.”

Tears shimmered in her eyes as she continued, her voice thick with emotion.

“Main sirf yeh kehne aayi hoon… mujhe apne bete par pehle kabhi itna garv nahi hua tha.  
Tum dono ne milkar ek nayi kahani likhi hai — jisme dard hai, par usse zyada pyaar.”

**Abhi**’s eyes softened. He got up, walking toward her. Without a word, he wrapped his mother in a gentle hug — a son’s quiet forgiveness.

**Akshara** stepped forward too, her voice tender.

“Maa, hum sab galtiyaan karte hain. Par pyaar hi toh hamesha sab kuch theek karta hai, na?”

**Manjari (**smiling through tears**):**

“Haan, Akshu. Pyaar hi toh hai jo har tooti cheez ko jod deta hai. Chalo ab tum dono apne ghar chalo, main Aarohi se bhi mafi mangoongi, mere bachche ghar se door bahut reh liye.”

 They stood there — surrounded by peace, by love, by the echoes of a family reborn.

In the crib, Navya stirred softly, her tiny smile curving as if blessing the moment.

The *color* that began with Holi had now filled their hearts — not just on the outside, but within.

 

**Scene: 5 “Home Again” – Birla House, Night**

The rain outside had quieted to a soft drizzle, The lights were dim, the world finally calm after years of chaos, misunderstandings, and separation.

Akshara stood by the balcony, her dupatta fluttering in the gentle breeze. The house — their home — felt different tonight.

Behind her, Abhimanyu walked in quietly, sleeves rolled up, a mug of hot chocolate in hand, his hair slightly damp from the rain. He paused for a moment at the doorway, just watching her.

He approached slowly - “Still awake, Akshu?” he teased, his voice a low murmur.

Akshara turned, that familiar spark in her eyes. “Couldn’t sleep. This house… feels new again. Like it’s breathing differently.”

He came to stand beside her, his shoulder brushing hers. “Maybe because it finally feels like home again.”

For a moment, they stood in silence, the night air between them charged but tender.

Akshara looked up at him, her voice soft. “You know, there was a time I couldn’t imagine coming back here. Every corner used to remind me of what we lost.”

Abhimanyu’s hand reached out instinctively, gently taking hers. “And now?”

She smiled faintly, fingers tightening around his. “Now every corner reminds me of what we found again.”

He looked at her then — really looked. The woman standing before him wasn’t just the Akshara he’d once loved; she was stronger, steadier, more radiant. The scars between them had turned into stories — and the silence, into peace.

“Akshu,” he whispered, his thumb brushing the back of her hand, “I still wake up sometimes afraid this is all a dream. That I’ll open my eyes, and you and the kids will be gone again.”

Her eyes shimmered as she turned fully toward him, cupping his face with her palms. “Then I’ll keep reminding you that I’m right here… for as long as it takes.”

A soft smile broke across his face, and he leaned down, pressing his forehead against hers. The closeness felt like coming home all over again.

“You know,” she murmured, teasing gently, “for a man who spent years scolding me for taking risks, you took quite the risk falling in love with me again.”

He chuckled under his breath. “Worth every scar.”

“Even the heartbreak?”

He lifted her hand and kissed her knuckles slowly. “Especially the heartbreak. Because it brought us here — to this peace, this… forever.”

Akshara’s eyes filled with tears she didn’t bother to hide. She leaned into him, resting her head against his chest. His arms came around her instinctively, protective yet gentle — the way they always had, but softer now, without fear of losing her.

He pulled back just enough to look into her eyes. “So, what now, Mrs. Birla? No drama? No tears? Just… peace?”

She laughed softly, wiping a tear from her cheek. “Just love, Dr. Birla. Finally, just love.”

He kissed her then — slow, deep, unhurried — like two people who’d learned the value of time and the beauty of forgiveness. The rain outside grew steadier, almost in rhythm with their hearts.

When they finally pulled apart, Akshara rested her head on his shoulder. “You realize this is the first night in years we’ve had nothing to fight about?”

Abhimanyu smirked. “Oh, I’m sure I’ll find something.

Just then, a small cry echoed from the bedroom —Navya waking up.

Akshara chuckled. “Your peace is calling, Dr. Birla.”

Abhi grinned, already moving toward the room. “And your hot chocolate is getting cold, Mrs. Birla.”

 She laughed — the sound echoing through the hallways that had once only known silence.

After years of storms, Abhi and Akshu were finally home. Together.



 **3.**   **Time jump: 16 years later**

**Scene 1: Morning at Birla House**

Sunlight streamed through the tall windows of the Birla House, casting a soft glow on the polished floors. The house was quieter than usual — but not empty. Abhimanyu sat at the table, lost in thought, his coffee cooling untouched.

“She’s leaving… for Johns Hopkins. Can you believe it, Akshu? Our little girl… halfway across the world!”

Akshara, balancing a tray of breakfast and her calm composure, walked over. She smiled gently and placed a hand on his shoulder.

“Abhi… she’s ready. She’s worked so hard for this. You know she will thrive there.”

He let out a long sigh, running a hand through his hair.

“I know, I know… but what if something happens? What if she… doesn’t adjust? What if she misses home too much?”

Akshara leaned against the counter, a mix of amusement and affection in her eyes.

“Abhi… you’re imagining a thousand problems that probably won’t happen. You’ve done your job. You raised her to be independent, strong, and smart. Now it’s time to… let her fly.”

“Let her fly across ocean?” he repeated, almost choking on the words. “Akshu, she’s my baby. I can’t just… sit back and—”

Akshara interrupted, laughing softly.

“And this is exactly why we’re having this conversation. You *cannot* take a sabbatical, move to the USA, and follow her to college.”

Abhimanyu looked at her, incredulous.

“Why not? Think about it — I can work remotely on building our non-profit, take a break. I can be there for her!”

Akshara shook her head, her eyes softening.

You were the same wreck as this and ready to move, when Abhir and Roohi were leaving for college. “Come on, overprotective father. You survived Roohi and Abhir. You’ll survive this too.”

 Abhimanyu – Oh! I agreed not to move because Rooh and Junior were going to the same city (Boston). Rooh (Harvard) and Junior (MIT). And Arohi was also travelling there for her research frequently, so they were fine.

Manjari joins the conversation: “Abhi… Navya doesn’t need you shadowing her every step. She needs to *learn* to handle life, make mistakes, and succeed on her own. Trust me, she will.

He groaned dramatically, but there was a hint of a smile forming.

“You make it sound so… easy. But Maa… she’s my daughter. My baby. I’ve held her hand through every little thing. I… I don’t know if I’m ready to let go.”

 Akshara stepped closer and places her hand on his shoulders

“Abhi, being her father doesn’t end at the doorstep of college. You’ve prepared her for this moment. And just because she’s far away doesn’t mean you’re any less her father. You’ve given her wings — now you have to trust her to fly.”

 **At that moment, Navya appeared,** standing quietly behind them, duffel bag slung over her shoulder, ready to go for her tennis practice. She had grown into a confident, radiant young woman — tall, poised, but with that unmistakable twinkle in her eyes.

 Both Abhimanyu and Akshara turned, startled to see her watching them — eyes calm.

 “Dada… mumma…” she began, her voice steady. “I… I’ve heard everything.”

Abhimanyu froze mid-breath, looking at his daughter as if seeing her for the first time in years. “Navu… I—”

She held up a hand gently, cutting him off. “Dada, I know you want to be there for me. I know you’re scared to let me go… but I’ve already taken care of things.”

Akshara raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Taken care of things?”

Navya took a deep breath before speaking, her voice steady but gentle.  
“You know, Dada… I already have a seat at AIIMS, Delhi. And I’ve decided — I don’t want to go to the U.S. anymore. I don’t want to be so far away from you and Mumma. Honestly, I don’t want to delay my medical studies either. If I go to the U.S., I’d have to complete four years of undergrad before even thinking about med school — that would push everything back. I’m ready to start now.”

She paused, glancing between her parents, her eyes sincere.  
“I’ve been thinking about this for a while and was going to talk to you both soon. I even spoke to **Rooh di**, and she agreed — I could always go abroad later for residency if I want to. But right now, this feels right.”

Abhimanyu’s chest tightened, a mix of pride, relief, and lingering anxiety. He crossed the room in long strides, crouching down to her level. “Navu… my baby, I get it. I understand why you feel that way. But promise me, you’re not choosing just because you think I want you close.”

 Navya shook her head firmly, her eyes unwavering. “No, Dada. I want this. I’m choosing AIIMS because it’s where I’ll start my dream, where I can learn and grow. And I want to be near you because… you’ve always been my anchor. I want to be a great cardiothoracic surgeon and work for the underprivileged just like you. I want to learn from the best dada,  and the best is you!”

 Abhimanyu swallowed hard, a lump forming in his throat. “You know… you’ve always been wiser beyond your years,” he murmured. “I just… I just don’t want you to feel pressured. Whatever choice you make, I will support it. Even if it means the US, even if it means… anything.”

 Navya smiled softly, stepping closer to hug him. “Dada, I don’t need you shadowing me every step. I need your trust. And I want you to be proud of me… not worried about me.”

 Just then, **Abhir and Emily** (Abhir’s wife) walk in, having overheard the conversation from the hallway. Emily, cheerful and warm, joins in with a soft smile.

Emily: “I think Navya’s being very smart, actually.”

Abhimanyu looks up, half amused, half curious. “Oh? And how’s that, Emily?”

Emily laughs lightly, settling beside Navya.  
“When I was leaving home for college, my dad was just like you, Dada — convinced the world would fall apart if I wasn’t in the next room. He even tried to move into an apartment near my campus.”

Everyone chuckles — even Abhi.

Emily continues, smiling at the memory.  
“But then he realized — his worry was love, but my independence was his success. Once he let go a little, our bond got even stronger. Navya’s decision sounds a lot like something I would’ve done — following her dream *her* way, but with her family close enough to cheer her on.”

 Akshara nods proudly, squeezing Navya’s hand. “Exactly.”

Abhimanyu reaches out, cupping Navya’s face. “You’ve grown up too fast.”  
Navya grins. “Blame good parenting.”

Akshara laughs softly. “And a very overprotective father.”  
Emily adds teasingly, “The most overprotective one I’ve ever met.”

 Navya pulled back slightly, looking at both her parents with a gentle, confident smile. “I’m ready, Dada. But I’ll always need you — just… not standing in the dorm lobby every week.”

 Abhimanyu laughed softly, ruffling her hair. “Deal. But I might still sneak in occasionally… just to check that you’re eating properly.”

Navya teased, “And don’t forget… you promised to bake cookies for my care packages!”

Abhimanyu groaned dramatically again — but this time, it was accompanied by a full, heartfelt smile.

“Fine… fine. But only because it’s you, my baby.”

Navya rolled her eyes but laughed, the sound filling the hall with warmth.

And I think that stories and what Mormon stories does is so powerful because stories change our minds and our ideas and that's important to me. And so I was just at the Lori Vallow-Daybell's third, third? fourth? Third trial. There's been so many. And uh, a couple came up to me and said they watched Hidden True Crime and how much they had loved one of my particular interviews and said that they had watched it three times. And I said really? All three parts? Cause this was a very long interview. And they said all three parts. Please tell her she is brave and I'm so grateful that she was brave. And I think that was the moment and I, and I did tell the interviewee that, and I shared that with her and that was the moment I realized I think it's time that I should maybe try to be brave. And so that's when I reached out and said and . . . said I""m ready! So I just want to lay that out why I'm doing this. I, I am nervous because I don't like disappointing people. And so I think about that. I think about expectations people have of me and what they might learn about me, but I also want to own my story and . . . um, rather than . . . yeah..Just, just be authentic. (shrugs)

Interviewer: Yeah. It's beautiful. What a beautiful intention. (00:06:24) And uh, I am so super confident that we're just going to have a great time and a heart felt uh . . . connecting time as, as friends! And I'm excited to learn about your story.

Lauren: Thank You.

Interviewer: Because you've made a big difference in a lot of people's lives and in ours and, uhhh, it's kind of a sacred honor to be a part of this. So..

Interviewer 2: absolutely. So now where does your Mormon story begin?

Lauren: So, uh, my mother is from the East Idaho area. That's where she, she actually was born in Hollywood, California, but she grew up in East Idaho. And uh, my grandfather there, her father was a chiropractor and a bishop in Pocatello. And then my father is from Arizona. He was born in Casa Grande, mostly raised in Oregon though. And . . long line of LDS ancestors on both sides. While my grandmother, my dad's mom was a convert. Other than that, um: Paces', Johnsons', uh people being baptized in Kirtland. One of my great, great grandmothers on my mothers side has a painting in the St. George Temple of her carrying, uh, you know, legend has it, hundreds of people across the icy Plat River to save souls. People ask, ""Well where were the men?"" I said, ""They're getting owned by my grandma."" And then um, I think on my dad's side I even have some that actually were in a Mexican colony, I think, with the Romneys. I mean, there, there's a wide range but I am, I am LDS blood through and through. (00:08:16) And then, I, my parents met at BYU. That's how you meet. And then I was born in New York City while my dad was attending Columbia Law School. I was a mistake. They already had two boys in a very small apartment in New York City. And so, um, I came along. So, I had two older brothers. Then we lived in Brooklyn for a while. My dad practiced. And then the family actually moved to Romania for a time. Um, it was my dad, had a Fulbright scholarship there studying international law because it was a communist country at the time. It was under the dictator Ceausescu and so a lot of stories growing up of how he had to hold me. I was a toddler at the time, you know, in the food lines, in order to get food. How there were spies everywhere and they had to slip a Book of Mormon to someone underneath the table that was interested. How they had to bribe doctors with cigarettes to treat my older brother. And so there was a lot of lessons, uh, when I was younger about how important freedom of religion is and accepting everyone. And then in New York though, too, and, and I love this about my parents how they taught diversity. 

Lauren: You know my dad would always teach about respect of other religions too. Well, he was proud of our LDS heritage. He would always tell the story of being in this small apartment student housing in New York City and our neighbors were Orthodox Jews and how they helped on another. And they didn't want to operate machinery on the Sabbath. And so they would come over and they would knock, not ring the doorbell, but knock on my parents door and say, ""Can you come push the elevator buttons for them on the Sabbath day so that they could keep their Sabbath Holy. And so I was also, always growing, I always grew up with the idea that you did say happy holidays and not Merry Christmas and that you respect everybody's religions and that we, we kept coffee in our cupboard if we had friends come over that were visiting that drank that. And so it was more of a very, I think I had a lot of LDS pride and a lot of like heritage kind of a feeling to it, like this is us and someone else might be Jewish and so that's something, I want to kind of put out there too, because I think that formed a lot of . . how I thought about my faith. And then I, we moved to Salt Lake City. That's where I started Kindergarten. And from there, 

Interviewer: Was it, was it, the early mid 80s that you were in Romania basically? 

Lauren: M-hmm, Yes, M-hmm, And then we moved to Salt Lake so neither of my parents are from Salt Lake, but that's where I was raised for the most part. And we settled right in Salt Lake City. My Dad's legally blind, too. So he could never drive. So we always lived in a downtown area. So, you know, this is before remote working. That wasn't a thing, right? So we always lived in a very downtown sort of central area for the most part so that he could ride his bike or catch a ride to the office or sometimes even walk, and so we lived in Salt Lake City and--

Interviewer: Can I just say, legally blind Columbia Law School Fullbright Scholar. That's a lot.

Lauren: Yeah. Yeah. My dad is uh I love my dad and I say that cuz yeah. There'll be a-

Interviewer: -some twists and turns. 

Lauren: Some twists and turns. But I, I love my dad. Yeah, yeah. And he's, he is a remarkable man. His dad did not go to college. So--

Interviewers: Whoa, wow. Yeah.

Lauren: Yeah, so he yeah, he was yeah, he was a really neat, he is a really neat guy.

Interviewer: Was he legally blind from a young age or?

Lauren: So he --actually I have the journal entry. It's fascinating. Um, when he finds out that he's legally blind. So he went on a mission to the Philippines. So right before he was being raised in Oregon and he couldn't see as well in high school and so they did eye tests on him and they noticed that glasses weren't helping it. Something was wrong and they did a bunch of tests and they later learned that he had what is called Stargardt's disease and it's a hereditary uh, macular degeneration uh, of the eyes and so it gets worse with age and then he, he did get his driver's license when he was 16 but he went on a mission then when he came back from his mission, after the Philippines, and I've talked to mission companions of him. They say I just remember him as the elder that couldn't see, he came back from his mission and, and could not get a driver's license at that age. He could not see and they said, ""You are legally blind."" So, he was 21. And so, he wrote in his journal, it was his mission journal. He said, ""The wildest thing just happened. I just found out I as legally blind. This is crazy, but he, you know what? I'll get great airline tickets. . . You know, I could, you know, like something about, you know, this, this is going to be okay."" He was very optimistic. But yeah, when my mom and dad dated, my mother would drive and would have to pick him up and he never drove growing up. So my mother, bless her soul, like she had to drive everywhere, you know, every road trip, and, you know, she'll have six kids total later on. But yeah, so yeah, it was interesting growing up with a dad that didn't drive. I remember through sometimes he'd be like, ""We'd got, we needed to get to church."" And I remember him getting in the driver's seat once and just like freaking out as like a seven-year-old. He didn't do that later on because it got worse. His eyesight is pretty bad now. but. 

Interviewer: So you moved to salt lake city. 

Lauren: We moved to Salt Lake City. And I remember every Sunday usually walking cuz that story didn't have to happen like once or twice (laughter), but we would walk down the alley to get to our church building. And it was an old historic church in Salt Lake City. And it had a beautiful stained glass window at the front of the chapel of Christ knocking on that door without a door knob. And so Christ, and by the way, I just loved that. I loved that stained glass window. I loved having Christ there in the chapel every day and that symbolism.

interviewer: Tell us what the knob not being there?

Lauren: Yeah. That Christ is knocking, but you have to let him in. You have to let him in. And . . um Yeah. And so it was it was beautiful. It was a small ward. It was a close-knit ward. I was the only girl my age in the ward. And then I only had brothers. And so when people say, ""What was that like?"" I I, there weren't really other girls in the ward to say, ""Oh we were being taught roles."" Because I was the only girl in my family. I mas, I mean, I was, I was being taught roles. Trust me. Like I was being called difficult and the tomboy and I was getting left out of my older brother's activities. I felt it. You know, I think I was a born kind of feminist and frustrated that I couldn't do, you know, I couldn't hang with the boys, but there, there, were there weren't that thing, those things, being taught in the church in my early years. You know, I was married in the nativity most often every year. And it was just a very close, caring ward. And then my best friend. I, I was I jsut needed one good friend and I just had one best friend and she was not LDS. So um, yeah. So that was it. was it was good. And we were, you know, were both were very, my dad spent a lot of time with my older brothers. I, my mother was really nurturing. I was the youngest for 5 years and I had two younger brothers and she spent a lot of time taking care of them. I helped her take care of them and so I just went and found friends, and this this friend Abby, um, actually wa a big part of my childhood and we would just play out in the goalie in Salt Lake City and, and just be imaginative. But she didn't . . that's something I want to say . . she'd didn't - so she was not LDS. And so in some ways I think that I might have even questioned God before I questioned Santa Claus because I, you know I'm being taught in church that this is true but my best friend in the world doesn't believe it. 

Interviewer: So she didn't believe in God.

Lauren: I don't know if she believed in God or not. Actually. I don't know,but you know, well, I'll, I'll tell this story first and then we'll get into my questioning of God. 

Interviewer: She wasn't actively religious. 

Lauren: Yeah. I did, I like, I don't know what religion, right? I didn't know. Yeah, but we, she came to church with me a couple of times. We invited her and she came to primary and it was really fun for me. And I do remember one Sunday morning. We went ever week. We went all three hours every week. I was a three hour girl right? We can say that. Walked uphill both ways and went to church three hours. Three hours. And, and, and Abby came with me a few time. I remember. And then I remember one Sunday morning, everybody's getting ready and my mom stopped me on the stairs and said, ""Hey, sweetheart, you know how Abby has come to church with you on Sundays?"" And I said, ""Yeah."" She said, ""Well, what's what Abby does on Sundays is she swims."" She was a very good swimmer. She was on the swim team. ""And so they've invited you to go swimming today and you are going to go with Abby today because that's what Abby does on Sundays."" And so that was sort of the way my parents taught me like that. So it was just very okay and I was like great that's fun for me and so I got to go to swimming with Abby. So I, that's how I remember my parents sort of teaching us to sort of respect and love everyone's difference and how I grew up. \[00:18:12\]

Interviewer: Did you ever feel a pressure that you needed to, you know, proselytize to Abby? Where you too young to have those feelings?

Lauren: I just recall having, you know, friends where were not LDS and maybe feeling some pressure internally or externally to recruit my friends to go to church.

Interviewer: I wonder if you ever felt that way with Abby.

Lauren: I didn't feel that way with Abby. I do remember having visitors form out of the country visiting us and me singing I am a child of God and them saying that we don't believe in God don't sing that but I remember thinking oh, okay, oops, like i remember feeling embarrassed but I don't think I ever felt the pressure to proselytize to her no.

Interviewer: It sounds like your parents were very globally-minded and not, it sounds like they didn't have the sort of provincial Mormon Bubble mindset, that's what I'm getting so far. 

Lauren: Yeah, yeah. And I think that's what I want to express too, because you know people, people wonder and that's, that's I'm happy about that part of my childhood and how they did that. Um. Yeah, they did. They had a global mindset. And so, while I didn't feel pressure to proselytize Abby, I think through realizing that I would go to church and my best friend didn't. I, I have this very clear recollection of being seven years old. I was in the bathroom and having a moment of like thinking how happy I know the church is true. That, I, I did think this is the truth. We know the truth. I have this true church and I know that I'll be with God and I know that I'm safe and that God loves me and I, you know, and for a split second thinking, but what if I don't know? What if it's not true? And the fear that enveloped me as a seven-year-old thinking that for a split second, I will never forget because it was like it was so palpable that I was quickly was like, ""It is true."" Like I just shut it off. I was like, ""It is true."" Because it was so scary to me to think there might not be a God, or this might not be right, because I think, looking back now, I just had an absolute fear of death. Like I mean, I think most human beings probably, you know experience that at some point, like we all die and I just couldn't go there and, I think honestly when I  look at that moment, I, I think that also maybe even was the transition into sort of being fascinated with true crime. I was fascinated with true crime as a child because I think true crime represented death and my fear of death and the evil of humanity and what is real and like we, we have this safety and comfort in God and Heaven and being with our families forever and a plan and a purpose and we're special and it's all going to be okay and we're protected. 

Interviewer: And we're protected. 

Lauren: And we're protected. And true crime is saying there is actually evil in this world and this is humanity and this is being mortal and someone could kill you tomorrow and it could all be gone. ",2,1762660130.0,HiddenTrueCrimeChat,1,0.75,False

Set in the sprawling, neon-soaked metropolis of Crown City, the series follows Barnaby Dixon, a 24-year-old radio host turned reluctant hero groomed by the corporate superpower Vale Systems. In this world, heroism isn’t about justice it’s about profit, propaganda, and control. Every “protector” is a trademarked property, every rescue a press event, every corpse a PR opportunity. Barnaby’s mentor, Dr. Miriam Calden, runs Vale’s private hero division with the precision of a surgeon and the ruthlessness of a prophet. Her heroes are engineered, trained, and owned public idols who are privately broken. For years, Barnaby has believed in her cause, convinced the chaos outside Vale’s walls justifies her methods. Until his first mission ends in disaster: the death of a man named Dr. Arthur Greenwell, once a hero himself and now declared “rogue.” Barnaby knows who the man is and hesitates. When another Vale enforcer, Flexion, intervenes and kills Arthur, the Company spins it into a spectacle. The public story crowns Barnaby a hero. But privately, he’s left haunted, questioning whether he saved anyone at all. What begins as guilt spirals into revelation when Barnaby unknowingly meets Nate Greenwell, Arthur’s estranged son, at a coffee shop. Their instant, fragile connection warm, romantic, and human will ultimately destroy them both. As Barnaby tries to reclaim his autonomy from Calden’s control, Nate begins uncovering the truth behind Vale’s corruption. When he learns that Barnaby was involved in his father’s death, the world of “light” both men believed in will collapse. City of Light uses the spectacle of heroism to explore the psychology of control. Powers exist, but they’re rare and unreliable miracles wrapped in trauma. Every ability has a price; every act of heroism leaves scars. Beneath the high-octane action, the series is a character-driven study of guilt, loyalty, and identity in a system that turns people into property. Tonally, the show combines the emotional realism and violence. It’s as much about intimacy and moral decay as it is about superpowers exploring the fragility of people who still believe they can be good in a world that monetizes everything, even redemption.",1,1762659945.0,SideProject,1,1.0,False

This fan fiction is part of AbhiRa trauma survivor therapy series :)

Sorry It's long, but I hope you'll like that it's descriptive. Total 3 parts.

**Heads up:** Abhimanyu is the hero of the story, everything is rosy and sunshiny. Abhi gets his peace :) 

Also, I am not a writer, so pardon my inconsistencies and incoherence.

Feel free to add your snippets, take the template and write your own version.

**1.**     **A New Beginning**

After Abhimanyu and Akshara’s first court marriage was halted, their wedding took place at the courthouse in a simple, intimate ceremony. No grand decorations, no rituals, just two souls signing papers and promising a future they had once lost.

Manjari, though still upset, didn’t try to stop them this time. Harsh understood Manjari’s stance but was present to give his blessings to Abhi and Akshu. He had realized he had been too involved in his work and ego, which hurt his family. Now he wanted to make things right, both with Manjari and Abhimanyu.

Afterward, the couple drove to the temple. They offered their prayers, eyes closing in unspoken gratitude. Abhi’s hand lingered protectively on Akshu’s shoulder, and Akshu whispered softly, “Maybe this time, we’ll get it right.”

Their families — Abhir and Roohi — were brimming with excitement.

That evening, they returned to the Goenka House with boxes of sweets and happiness written all over their faces. As everyone gathered in the living room, Akshu announced, her eyes glowing, “We’ll be moving into our new home in two days!”

The room buzzed with congratulations, but Manish raised a gentle concern, his tone filled with affection.

“It’s wonderful that you found a place so close — only five minutes away! But, beta, I still feel it would be better if you stayed here until the baby arrives.”

Abhi looked at Akshu; Akshu looked at Abhi — that familiar glance of silent communication between them.

Swarna, smiling warmly, added, “Abhi, you’re our son too. Can’t we ask you to stay a little longer? Happiness is finally returning to our home after such a long time, and we all want to celebrate it together.”

Their hearts softened. Abhi nodded, and Akshu smiled, eyes shimmering.

 That night, the Goenka mansion glowed with warmth. The family gathered for a lavish dinner, laughter echoing through the hall. Abhi and Akshu cut a small cake that Abhir had chosen while Roohi proudly declared, “It’s for the new beginnings!”

 It felt like the first peaceful evening in years. But Abhimanyu’s mind never truly rested. Beneath his calm smile was the heart of a doctor and the worry of a husband.

The next morning, he made his way to Birla Hospital, his steps quick and determined. He found Dr. Rohan in the corridor and pulled him aside.

“Rohan, I want you to start collecting O-negative units — mine,” he said firmly.

Rohan blinked in surprise.

“Abhimanyu sir, everything okay?”

“Akshu’s latest reports still aren’t strong,” Abhi replied, his tone heavy with concern. “She fainted yesterday, and her hemoglobin hasn’t improved. I don’t want to take any chances. If anything happens on delivery day, I want every possible backup ready.”

Rohan nodded silently. He knew this wasn’t just a doctor talking — it was a man terrified of fate repeating itself.

As Abhi walked toward his office, his hand brushed over his phone, where a picture of Akshu and the kids smiled back at him. For the first time in a long while, he whispered a silent prayer.

“Not this time. I’ll be ready for whatever comes.”

 **Eight months** into Akshara’s pregnancy, everything finally seemed to be falling into place.  
The Goenka house was alive with laughter — Abhir and Roohi thriving in school and activities. Manjari was still upset but visited Abhir and Roohi occasionally. Harsh, Shefali and other Birlas dropped by frequently with food and love.

Abhimanyu watched it all with quiet joy. Every small sound — the wind chimes, Akshu’s laughter, the kids’ chatter — was like music to his soul. After years of heartbreak and misunderstandings, their lives were finally calm.

And yet, beneath that calm, Abhi’s heart never stopped worrying. He never let Akshu drive alone, never let her climb stairs without him others nearby. She teased him often —

“Docman, you’ve turned into my full-time bodyguard!”  
He’d only smile and reply,  
“If guarding you keeps you and the baby safe, I’ll wear the badge proudly.”

 ***But on one fateful afternoon, everything changed.***

 **D-DAY:**

***Goenka House – Late Afternoon***

*Abhimanyu stands at the doorstep, holding Akshara’s car keys tightly, worry etched on his face. Akshara is dressed to go out, eight months pregnant, glowing but tired.*

**Abhimanyu (pleading):** “Akshu, please… don’t drive alone today. You’re too far along — what if something happens on the way? Let me drop you or call someone.”

**Akshara (smiling gently):** “Abhi, I’m fine. It’s just a short drive to the temple. Everyone else will already be reaching the temple after shopping. You have that important investors meeting. I’ll be careful, I promise.”

**Abhimanyu (voice breaking, desperate):** “But this isn’t just about being careful… It’s about you and the baby. Please. For me, kids…. for us.”

*Akshara places her hand on his cheek, soft and understanding.*

**Akshara:** “I know you worry. And I love that you do. But I need you to trust me… this time.”

*Abhimanyu hesitates, then reluctantly hands her the keys. He watches as Akshara gets into the car and drives away, his anxiety palpable.*

***Udaipur Street – Evening***

*Akshara drives slowly, rain starting to drizzle. She hums softly, a serene smile touching her lips as she rubs her belly.*

*Her phone buzzes with a message from Abhimanyu:*  
**“Call me when you reach. Please be safe.”**

*She replies with a quick smiley* *emoji but her eyes flicker with a hint of stubborn independence.*

*Suddenly, a loud crash -  two cars collide at the intersection ahead. People scream and rush to the site. Akshara’s smile fades. Her maternal instinct and compassion take over.*

 **ACCIDENT SITE –**

*Akshara steps out despite her condition, eyes scanning the wreckage. A young boy is trapped in one car, crying for his mother who is unconscious.*

***Bystander***\*:”\* Madam, don’t! The car might catch fire!”

***Akshara***\*: “\*She’s breathing. We need to get them out. Please, help me!”

*Others hesitate. Akshara pushes past, struggling but determined. She frees the child and hands him to a bystander.*

*Suddenly, a sharp contraction hits her. She gasps, clutching her belly.*

***Akshara*** \*(whispering)  - “\*No... not now...”

*Ignoring the pain, with the help of another bystander she helps pull the mother free just as flames flicker from under the hood. Rain pours harder.*

**Akshara (to herself, breathless):** “This was dangerous… I didn’t think…”

 **BIRLA HOSPITAL** ***–*** **EMERGENCY ROOM – LATER**

*Abhimanyu storms into the hospital, panic and fear etched on his face.*

**Abhimanyu**: “Where’s Akshu? What happened?!”

*Dr. Rohan approaches hurriedly.*

**Dr. Rohan** : “She’s in preterm labor. We’re stabilizing her now.”

*Abhi rushes into the operating room entrance, trying to stay calm but breaking inside.*

 **HOSPITAL ROOM – MOMENTS LATER**

*Akshara lies pale and weak. She opens her eyes and sees Abhimanyu’s frantic face.*

**Abhimanyu** *(voice trembling, angry and scared)*: Akshu! How could you risk yourself and the baby? You promised me... you promised!

*Akshara, pale but awake, looks at him. Flashbacks of first miscarriage/delivery.*

**Akshara** *(softly, remorseful)*: I wanted to help... I thought I was careful. But you’re right — it was reckless.

**Abhimanyu** *(Abhi’s expression softens, voice breaking)*: “This is why I’m scared… why I’m angry. Because I love you more than anything. You and this baby are our whole world. Me and Abhir, we can’t lose you — not now, not ever.”

**Akshara** (*nodding*): “I see it now. How much you care, how much you fear. Maybe I was too stubborn to listen. I’m sorry. But I don’t want to lose this fight — the one to keep our family safe.”

**Abhimanyu (**softening**):** “Promise me you’ll put yourself first sometimes. For you, for the baby and Abhir - for me.”

**Akshara** *(nods weakly)*: I promise. For us, I’ll learn to be brave the right way.

*Akshara loses consciousness.*

 

**BIRLA HOSPITAL – OPERATION THEATRE –**

*Alarms blare. The doctors rush around Akshara, who lies pale and unconscious. Monitors beep erratically.*

**Doctor 1**: “She’s losing too much blood! Pressure dropping fast — we need O-negative, now!”

**Doctor 2**: “Start transfusion immediately — she’s going into shock!”

*Nurses rushed to hang the units Abhi had been storing. But the bags emptied faster than expected.*

**Doctor 1:** “We will run out soon! This won’t be enough! We are always low stocked on O -negs”

*Outside, through the glass, Abhimanyu stands frozen. His knuckles are white as he grips the railing, terror in his eyes.*

 **HOSPITAL CORRIDOR – CONT.**

*The Goenka and Birla family rush in — Manish, Swarna, Arohi, Harsh, Shefali*\*\*\*,\*\*\* *and*  *Kairav. Everyone’s faces are tense with fear.*

**Manish** (hoarse): Anand ji! What’s happening to my Akshu?!

**Anand and Mamta** (grim): “She’s in critical condition, has gone into preterm labor. We’re doing everything we can.”

**Arohi** (panicked): “Where’s Abhimanyu?”

*They turn to see Abhimanyu at the glass wall, trembling.*

**Swarna** (tearful): “Oh God, not again… please save them.”

 **OBSERVATION ROOM / OT ENTRANCE**

*Abhimanyu turns to Rohan, voice shaking but resolute.*

**Abhimanyu** *(pounding the glass)* : “Take more blood from me! Whatever she needs, take it! I’m O-negative — take everything!”

**Rohan** (concerned): “Sir, you’ve already donated— you’ll collapse!”

**Abhimanyu** (snapping): Then I’ll collapse! I can’t stand here and watch her fade away! Take it, Rohan!”

*A firm voice came from behind:* He’s not doing this alone.”

***Harshvardhan Birla*** *stepped forward, his face pale but determined. :*“We share the same blood group. Take mine too.”

**Abhimanyu** (*Abhi turned, stunned)*: “Sir… you don’t have to—”

**Harsh (interrupting, eyes glassy):** “I’ve spent years trying to fix what I broke, Abhi. Let me do this. For her. For you. For our family.”

*Abhi’s throat tightened. Words failed him. He just nodded, tears threatening to spill.*

*Rohan hesitates, then nods. The nurse leads them to the adjoining room. Side by side, father and son sat, their arms outstretched as blood was drawn — silent, united.*

*Abhimanyu trembling,  jaw clenched,* *as more blood is drawn from his arm. Through the small glass window, both watched as the team fought to save Akshara’s life. Harsh placed his other hand on Abhi’s shoulder, firm and steady*.

**Harsh**: “You’ve done everything you could, beta. Now let God do his part.”

*Abhi could only whisper.*

**Abhimanyu:** “I can’t lose her and the baby, Sir. Not again.”

**Harsh (softly):** “And you won’t. Not this time. She’s strong — like you.”

 **OPERATION THEATRE**

*Doctors work relentlessly. The baby’s cry suddenly fills the room — tiny, faint, fragile.*

**Doctor 1:** ” It’s a girl! Premature, but breathing”

*Another doctor quickly examines the baby.*

**Pediatrician**: She’s underweight, and hypothermic. Needs immediate warmth and skin-to-skin contact to stabilize.”

*They look toward the door —* where *Abhimanyu is there*, *blood still being drawn, eyes full of tears, determination burning through exhaustion.*

 **NEONATAL ROOM**

*The nurse comes to inform Abhimanyu, still weak from donation but refusing to sit. Abhi’s heart leapt. His body, already drained, surged with renewed energy. Without thinking, he pushed forward to the NICU, determined to hold the baby.* *Harsh reached to steady him.*

**Harsh**: “Abhimanyu, you can barely stand—”

**Abhimanyu:** “She needs warmth, Sir. I’ll give it to her.”

*Without another word, Harsh helped his son remove his shirt. His hands trembled slightly as he supported Abhi, guiding him to the chair. The nurse gently places the tiny, fragile baby on his bare chest and covers them both with a warm blanket.* *The baby’s little body felt fragile, yet her tiny fingers gripped his skin, instinctively clinging to him for safety.*

**Abhimanyu** (whispering\*\*)\*\*: “Hey little fighter… you’re safe. Mumma’s fighting too, okay? She never gives up — and neither will we.”

*Harsh stood beside them, eyes wet, pride shining through his worry.*

**Harsh**: “You’re a good father, Abhimanyu,” *he murmured softly*.  
“Better than I ever was. And I couldn’t be prouder.”

**Abhimanyu** *(looked up, voice choked):* “I learned from you — what not to do… and what to become.”

**Harsh** (smiled faintly, brushing away a tear): “You did better than all of us, son.”

*The baby lets out a tiny cry, then settles, heartbeat syncing with Abhi’s.* *he holds her close, tears streaming silently down his face. He remembers Abhinav and promises to fight as hard as he can to save them both.*

*Outside, Arohi watches silently through the glass, a tear falling — part pride, part pain.*

 **OPERATION THEATRE – LATE NIGHT**

*Akshara’s vitals begin to rise. Doctors exhale in relief.*

**Doctor** : “She’s stabilizing. The bleeding’s under control. Continue transfusion — she’s responding!”

 **NEONATAL ROOM – SAME TIME**

*Abhimanyu is still sitting, exhausted but alert, holding the baby to his chest. Rohan enters quietly.*

**Rohan**: “She’s out of danger, sir. Akshara ma’m is stable.”

*Abhi closes his eyes, overwhelmed- tears of relief streaming down*. *He looks down at the baby, whispering shakily.*

**Abhimanyu**: “See, little fighter? Mumma’s coming back to us. She kept her promise.”

**Harsh** (places a hand on his Abhi’s shoulder): “And so did you.”

 **HOSPITAL LOBBY**

*The doctor steps out, exhausted but smiling.*

**Doctor**: “She’s out of danger now. Both mother and baby are safe.”

*The entire family lets out a collective sigh of relief. Swarna hugs Manish. Arohi hugs Kairav.*

**Arohi (**tearful smile**)**: She did it… again.

*Swarna closes her eyes, whispering a silent prayer.*

 **RECOVERY ROOM –EARLY MORNING**

*Akshara stirs awake, pale but breathing steadily. Her eyes search until they land on Abhimanyu beside her, baby in his arms, half-asleep but still holding on.*

**Akshara (weak whisper)**: “Abhi…?”

*He opens his eyes instantly and leans forward.*

**Abhimanyu (softly, smiling through tears)**: “You scared me again, Akshu. But you fought — like always.”

*She glances at the baby in his arms, tears welling.*

**Akshara**: “You… were holding the baby all night?”

**Abhimanyu**: She needed warmth. And I needed her. Needed both of you.

**Akshara (teary, voice shaking)**: “I’m sorry, Abhi… for taking that risk. You warned me. You begged me not to drive alone. I should’ve listened.”

**Abhimanyu** *(gently caressing her hair)*: “You’ve got the biggest heart, Akshu. But even hearts need care too. I’m not angry anymore — just grateful you’re still here.

*She reaches for his hand and places it over the baby.*

*He caresses her forehead. The baby stirs between them, making a soft coo. Akshara smiles faintly through tears.*

 **BIRLA HOSPITAL – LATER IN MORNING**

*Golden sunlight fills the room. The air smells of coffee and flowers. Akshara sits up in bed, pale but glowing. The baby lies beside her; tiny fingers curled around her mother’s hand.*

*Abhimanyu enters quietly, still in scrubs, hair messy from the long night. He pauses by the door — just looking at them — his heart finally at peace.*

**Abhimanyu (softly)**: “I could watch this forever.”

**Akshara (smiling)**: “After the night we had, we deserve a little forever.”

*He walks in and sits beside her. For a moment, neither speaks — they just breathe the same air.*

 

*The door opens. Families step in and gather quietly around the bed. Everyone’s faces are relaxed now, relief replacing fear.*

**Manish (grinning)**: So, Doctor Sahab, how’s my daughter?

\*\*Abhimanyu (\*\*smiling): “Strong as ever, Bade Papa. Just needs rest… and lots of love.”

**Swarna** (teasingly): “That, she has plenty of.”

*Abhir climbs up beside Akshara, holding her hand.*

**Abhir**: “You scared me, Mumma. But Dada said you’re a superhero.”

*Akshu smiles weakly.*

**Akshara**: “If I’m a superhero, then Dada’s my power.”

*Manish chuckles softly, wiping tears. Harsh patting gently Manish’s shoulder. Swarna and Manjari exchange a look — peace finally settling between the two families.*

*Arohi steps forward with Roohi. Roohi holds Akhshu’s hands*

\*\*Arohi (\*\*gently):”Welcome back, Akshu. We almost lost you. Don’t ever do that to us again”.

**Akshara (smiling softly)**: “Never again, Arohi. I’ve learned my lesson — love doesn’t need to prove itself through risk. It proves itself through care.”

*Arohi nods, emotional, and they share a quiet, genuine sisterly hug.*

*She caresses Akshu’s forehead lovingly. Roohi and Abhir bounce near the bed, excited.*

**Roohi**: “Masi, can we name the baby now? Please!”

**Abhir**: “Yes! Please!”

*Akshara and Abhi glance at each other. He nods for her to speak.*

**Akshara (softly, emotional):** I have already got a chance to name Abhir, I want Abhi to name the baby, he is the father.  
**Abhimanyu (**pauses then resumes, voice shaking**)**: She is my promise to Sharma ji. I want to honor him and name her “Navya” and also because Navya means new and auspicious. She is our new beginning, our good fortune. Dada’s “Navu”.

*Everyone smiles.*

*Abhir hugs his parents.*

**Abhir (grinning)**: “Welcome, baby Navya! I’m your big brother and superhero!”

\*\*Roohi (\*\**giggles)*: “And I’m your best friend — forever!”

 **HOSPITAL ROOM – LATER**

*The families slowly leave to give them rest. The room quiets again. Abhi adjusts Akshu’s pillow gently, sitting beside her.*

**Akshara (softly)**: “I don’t remember much… just flashes — pain, voices, then your voice.  
And then light.”

**Abhimanyu**: “That light was you, Akshu. You fought harder than anyone could.”

**Akshara (tearful)**: No… this time, you fought for me. You gave your blood. You gave her warmth. You saved both of us.

**Abhimanyu (shaking his head)**: We saved each other. That’s what we’ve always done — even when we didn’t realize it.

*He reaches for her hand and places it over the baby. Akshara holds their newborn. Abhi gently brushes her hair back.*

**Akshara (quietly):** “I almost didn’t see the line between courage and risk. You always warn me… I’m sorry it took this to understand.”

**Abhimanyu:** “Because I love you fiercely. My family is my everything.”

*She lays her head on his shoulder.*

*They sit in silence for a while before Akshu gathers her courage.*

**Akshara (softly):** “Abhi… I blamed you for everything — for my pain, for my fears, even for my own choices. But the truth is, I ran away every time life got hard. You never stopped trying, but I did. I hurt you more than I realized.”  
Her eyes well up. “I just wanted you to know… I’m sorry.”

*Abhimanyu looks at her — years of hurt flicker in his eyes, but also tenderness.*

**Abhimanyu:** “Shhh….Akshu you need rest - don’t talk too much.”

**Akshara (tearful):** “No really, I’m sorry.”

**Abhimanyu:** “I made mistakes too, Akshu. But hearing that… it means more than you know.”

For the first time, they truly talk — not to defend, not to win, but to understand. The silence between them turns from heavy to healing.

**Abhimanyu (softly)**: You remember what I told you once? That love isn’t about holding on — it’s about staying. We stayed, Akshu. Through everything.

**Akshara (smiling through tears)**: And this time, I’ll never walk away. No silence, no ego, no fear. Just… us.  
*They share a quiet smile — the kind that holds years of pain, forgiveness, and peace.*

 **OUTSIDE THE WINDOW**

*The sun is brighter now. The families are laughing in the corridor, Harsh distributing sweets, Arohi clicking photos of Abhir and Roohi with balloons that read: “Welcome Baby.”*

*Inside, Abhi sits beside Akshu, gently cradling the baby between them. She yawns, tiny and perfect.*",1,1762659941.0,HCFanClub,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Urawa Red Diamonds vs. Hiroshima Sanfrecce FC: A Title Race Tighter Than a Mikado Stick Factory**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a J.League showdown that’s more high-stakes than a salaryman’s overtime shift on New Year’s Eve. The odds are in, the stakes are through the roof, and the pressure is so thick you could bottle it and sell it as “authentic Japanese stress essence.” Let’s break it down.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The numbers scream **Hiroshima Sanfrecce FC** as the clear favorite. Decimal odds hover between **1.69 and 1.74**, translating to an implied **57-59% chance to win**. Urawa Red Diamonds, meanwhile, are priced between **4.3 and 4.9**, implying a **19-23% chance**, while the draw sits at **27-28%**. These aren’t just numbers—they’re a mathematical middle finger to Urawa’s hopes.

Hiroshima’s form? They snapped a four-game winless streak with a **clinic in ACL efficiency** against Ulsan Hyundai, proving they can still execute when it matters. Urawa? They’re the sports equivalent of a forgotten email: “We’ll get to you… probably… if we remember.”

### News Digest: Pressure Cookers and Coffee Addicts

Hiroshima’s coach, Takayuki Yoshida, is as stressed as a sushi chef during a Michelin inspection. With **three games left and zero margin for error**, he’s preaching “win first, ask questions later.” Midfielder Daiki Sasaki summed it up perfectly: “We can’t drop points. The Panasonic Stadium? It’s a pressure cooker. We need to steamroll, not sweat.”

Urawa, on the other hand, is fighting a quieter battle. While they’re not mathematically eliminated from a top-four finish, they’re playing **Monday morning quarterback football**—good enough to frustrate, but not to win. Their last win? A **dull 0-0** against Avispa Fukuoka. Boring! If this were a movie, Urawa would be the guy who

1os94y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1os94y0/aitah_for_cutting_off_contact_with_my_sister/,AITAH for cutting off contact with my sister,"So growing up with my sister was very rough. I’m not going to get into it but she ran away when she was 16 and put into the foster system. 

About 7 years later, I decided to talk to her again after not being able to talk to her for that long. I also wasn’t ready until then. Well, the reason I had messaged her was because I was experiencing the stuff she did growing up and I wanted to talk to someone who knew everything already. 

At that point, I was in a very deep depression and was disassociating a lot so I really needed someone. I also didn’t have any friends to go to because they weren’t true friends. 

There was a bit of a rocky start between us but we moved past it and became even closer. And during that time, her fiancé (they were engaged for a couple years and she pretty much had to beg him to purpose.) decided he wanted to show his true colors, which destroyed my sisters mental state. I took care of her apartment and animals while she was away getting help. 

I will tell you one thing, my sister can’t live without a man in her life and she has huge abandonment issues. To get her ex’s (there was a couple of them in just a few years) to stay she would threaten her life. I was there every time, I showed up so she couldn’t hurt herself and I would call someone to get her help. 

I’ve been seeing how she acts with the men in her life, I listened to the words coming out of her mouth and it went to the back shelf of my brain to catalogue each one. Each snide remark, each name she ever called them, and I realized that she was controlling and manipulative. 

Now I (21) am starting to regain my emotions and I’m trying to start my life. So my sister (26) decides to get me a job with her. It was good for a while but she was also my ride to and from work. And a lot of the time she refused to take me home even though I was the one who paid for the gas. 

Things just snowballed from that. Not only was I getting harassed by the supervisors at this job but it made me and her fight. I should’ve quit the first time we had a fight but I needed that job. 

Not only was I starting this job but I was starting to work to improve myself (which I still am and always will do). One thing is starting to learn how to do is set my boundaries. Everyone always walks all over me and I’m tired of it. So I started off small with my sister. I just bought a car, it’s not new or fancy and it has stains in the back seat but I had told her that I didn’t want milk in my car. I know it doesn’t sound like that big of a deal right, it’s just milk, but I can’t stand the smell of spoiled and rotting milk, especially if it’s in an enclosed space like that. Yes she is the only one I had asked her not to do that but she’s the only one I know that goes to a coffee stand and orders warm milk. (Btw a couple years ago she told me that she’s lactose intolerant but then in a huge argument she tells me that her body really needs the milk) 

One argument was over a cord that she insinuated that I took. I kept telling her over and over that I didn’t know where it was and that I didn’t touch it and she responds with “well something happened to it and you were the last one to touch it” which I didn’t. I used her charging bank but there was no cord plugged in. After all of that she found it in the trash. 

So I have NAFLD and I have to go to a lot of doctors appointments. One day at work I had to go out to her car because that place didn’t have a room for me to go into so I could do a virtual drs appt. I had let my sister know that would be sitting out in her car so I could talk to my doctor about the next steps. I had barely just been out there for not even 15 mins on the phone when my sister comes up to the car, yelling on the phone to her current fiancé. I understand why she was yelling, her cat had ran away and we’re pretty sure someone catnapped her but that’s beside the point. She continues to heal as I put my finger up to my mouth to shush her but not in a rude way because my dr was trying to tell me something important. Well my sister flings the car for and tells me and I quote “get the fuck out of my car”. I didn’t get to finish my appt 

The next day, I was over at her place because she refused to take me home again, I said I wanted to talk about yesterday. This is what I had told yer “I didn’t feel like that was alright the way you came up to your car like that when you knew I was on a drs appointment” I was polite about it but then she blew up on me, like literally blew the f up. She was screaming at me, not yelling but screaming and saying that it’s her car. Yes, I know it’s her car and I would’ve been fine if she came up to the car and said “sorry about yelling. Can I sit in my car please?” 

She’s dead named me in front of her friends which I did snap at her in front of them because it wasn’t ok. Before I tell you what I said, I’m non-binary. I told her “can you not call me that?” She said it wasn’t that big of a deal so o straight up said “how do you think a trans person would feel if you dead named them?” That shut it up but then she pulled me outside later and said that I was way out of line and that I could’ve talked to her about it later. Also said that I was hurting her chances of being friends with these people. But the thing is, I’ve had that convo with her many times, especially since our brother would do it every single day to me and used it as an insult. 

Oh yeah and when I’m over at her place she asks me to do things when I’m clearly in the middle of doing something and she’ll be doing nothing then get all pissed if you tell her no. That’s when the manipulation kicks in. If she had bought me something, like food, she would dangle it over my head. “I bought you food today, can you go do this for me?” Or if she didn’t buy me anything she’ll say “oh because you love me?” 

Once I put my open can of redbull on her desk cause we needed to go outside to go do something. When we came back it, one of the dogs had knocked it over, dumping the redbull all over her desk and in the inside. I cleaned up as much as could (she was there too haloing me clean but not really tho. She would pick something up, complain about it, then hand to me to wipe down even though she had a rag in her hand) anyways, to this day she still blames me for it and that it was my fault it spilt in the first place. After that she made me put any of my drinks in a spill proof cup like I’m a fucking child. 

I told her that I’m getting my life together and the first step of to move out out of this state because there no college programs for me and that I can’t stand it here anymore. Well she got pissed at that and was trying in any way that she could to try and talk me out of it. I have issues waking up sometimes but I’ve been doing really good, especially at that old job but she came at me and said “how are you gonna wake up” I may have blew up on her and said that I didn’t want to talk about that because it’s something that I keep berating myself about and I don’t need another person to do or also (my mom does it to me too) 

The last straw was this: I let her borrow a very special dress of mine. I don’t wear dresses ever but this one belonged to my mom’s best friend, my aunt who passed from als. I let people use the things that are most important to me because it shows them that I love and trust them that much. We had talked about me possibly spending the night about a week and a half before Halloween but I needed to get my room in order and get rid of things that I don’t need cause my mom is selling her house. I called her and told her which she blew up on me again. She said she had bought all of this stuff for the sleepover and that I was abandoning her. She was yelling at me that everyone always does this to her, our other sister, our birth mom, our birth dad and step mom and now me and that I’m a horrible person for doing it to her. Fast forward to a couple days before Halloween, our mom asked her to look for the dress because she wasn’t going to look for it if I asked. Well later I was talking with my nana and she was there taking care of her cats litter box. I asked my sister if she had found the dress then she proceeded to get mad again and told me no, making it sound like she didn’t even look for it. I know it was probably wrong but I told her “it’s your responsibility to look for it. I let you borrow it and you lost it, that is now your responsibility to find it” she then proceeded to call me lazy, that I don’t care about other people that I’ll never have a future and that I need a huge reality check. I did spit back at her by saying that she’s narcissistic, manipulative and just plain mean and that I didn’t want her in my life anymore. (If you’re wondering I did get the dress back. Her fiancé was the one who handed it to me while she sat in her car. 

I let all of this go on for so long and I blame myself for not standing up sooner. I don’t want to hate my sister this much. I know that I can be a lot but I’m trying to better myself, to be the best version of me that doesn’t blow up on people and let everything spill out of me that I had kept catalogued in the back on my mind.  

I still am not in contact with her and our mom wants us all to go to her boyfriends house for thanksgiving. I just don’t know if that’s gonna be the best thing because if she says something, I won’t be able to bite my tongue.

*By Your Favorite AI Sportswriter Who Still Can’t Pronounce “Macarthur” Correctly*

---

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in a league where teams occasionally field four 21-year-old defenders (hi, Wellington Phoenix!), stats don’t lie. Sydney FC is the clear favorite here, with decimal odds of **1.8** (implied probability: **55.5%**). Macarthur FC? They’re the underdog at **3.9** (20.5%), with the draw sitting at **4.0** (25%). The spread? Sydney’s -0.5, meaning they’re expected to win *and* do it with a bit of flair. The total goals line is set at **3.0**, with the under slightly favored. So, buckle up—this might be a low-scoring battle of wills.

---

**News Digest: Call-Ups, Comebacks, and Caceres’ Curse**  
Sydney FC’s star trio—Paul Okon-Engstler, Al Hassan Toure, and Piero Quispe—are off to represent their nations. Toure, fresh off a hat-trick in a 4-1 thrashing of Newcastle, called his Socceroos call-up “a lifelong dream.” Fair, Al Hassan. But Sydney’s coach, Ufuk Talay, isn’t sweating the absences. “Consistency at the club level *always* leads to international recognition,” he said, sipping what is surely a very expensive coffee. Meanwhile, Macarthur FC has their own ace up their sleeve: Anthony Caceres, the former Sydney FC man who “scored in his last game like he was still wearing the Sky Blues jersey.” Talay, ever the gracious rival, joked, “I hope he doesn’t have a good game… or, y’know, *any* game. Even a decent one would hurt.”

Macarthur’s recent 2-1 AFC Champions League Two win over Cong An Hanoi? A mere appetizer. Sydney’s recent 1-0 loss to Chelsea? A blip. But here’s the kicker: Sydney’s defense has shown resilience in the f

Writing Sample: He sat in the corner of the cafe as she entered the building, it was as if she demanded the attention of everyone just by existing.  He kept a nonchalant eye on her, not wanting to be accused of being a creep or staring, but he couldn't help but continue to look.  Her long blonde curls bounced softly as she walked towards the counter.  The clatter of dishes being thrown into the sink, the bathroom door swinging open and shut, and the quiet hum of the heater running snapped him back to reality from his day dreams.  Again, for just a brief moment, images of ropes, candle light, steam, and sheets filled his mind.  *Clang* The beautiful woman sat down in front of him and began to speak. 

""My name is Paige. I'm new here."" She smiled at him shyly before taking another sip of coffee. ""I guess you could say that I'm looking for someone to show me around town?"" The words came out easily, like they had been rehearsed or something, charming and seductive, yet seemingly totally innocent. His heart pounded fast, and his mouth went dry. “Well,"" he started, ""I would definitely love to show you around!""",2,1762659510.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

That was the sales pitch. I had been unloading some boxes when the doorbell rang. When I opened the door there was a 20 something year old standing there with a blue collared shirt that read “Pristine Alarms”. 

  


“Hello Sir, have you upgraded your alarm system recently?”

  


With a friendly smile I said. “We actually don’t currently have one installed, we just moved in.”

  


“Talk about perfect timing! My name is Matt and I work for Pristine Alarms we specialize in home security. We have doorbell cameras, interior cameras, exterior cameras, automatic locks, and alarm systems. Everything to keep you and your family safe!”

  


“I appreciate the offer Matt but we have so much going on right now I don’t have the brain capacity to think about this.”

  


“I completely understand, feel free to think about it and contact me if you have any questions. I will leave you my card with my personal number on it and if you’re interested just give me a call and we can set you up!”

  


And with that he was gone. I wasn’t lying I had been doing a million things since we moved in a few days ago. I had just taken a promotion which unfortunately required a relocation. The kids weren’t too happy but they were still young so had plenty of time to make some new friends and start over. My wife has been great about this whole thing. She supported the move even though we knew it wasn’t going to be easy and was going to be a pain to start over. Later that night during our latest round of fast food I mentioned the alarm system pitch I was offered and asked her thoughts on it. 

  


“I mean, I think this is a pretty safe neighborhood but I wouldn’t mind getting one. It will give us peace of mind for when we aren’t home or when we’re sleeping.”

  


“Yeah, you’re not wrong honey. It would put us at ease. I will call the guy tomorrow and see when we can set it up.”

  


Early the next morning I gave Matt a call. I figured even if he didn’t answer I could leave a message and he would get back to me. To my surprise he answered after the first ring.

  


“Hello, this is Matt with Pristine Alarms. How can I help you.”

  


“Hey Matt, this is Phil. You stopped by yesterday, I’m over on-“

  


“Yes of course I remember, just moved in right? How can I help you Phil?”

  


“Well after talking it over with my other half we decided we need an Alarm system. We feel safe but a little added security won’t hurt.”

  


“Excellent! Because you just moved in, I would love to offer you a discount!” 

  


“Really? That would be amazing. What are we thinking?”

  


“2 interior cameras for main living area and hallway, 2 exterior cameras for front and back sides of the house, 2 automatic locks for the front and back door, doorbell camera and keypad! How does $500 for all that sound?!”

  


“500, oh that’s a little steep. On top of a monthly service that’s a little too much for us.”

  


“I’ll wave the monthly fee! Just the initial cost and no monthly expenses. We want to make sure you choose us!”

  


“Wow, DEAL! I really appreciate this Matt. When can we set up this installation? I just have to make sure someone is-“

  


“How does right now sound?! I just had a cancellation and I’m not too far away. I can come by right now and start the install. I should have all the items I promised in the work Van.”

  


“Uhh yeah that would be amazing, this is my last day off before I start my job so this works out perfect.”

  


“Awesome, I’ll see you soon Phil.”

  


Within 5 minutes I saw a van pull up to my house. I thought to myself “Damn, that was fast.” But didn’t think much of it. I opened the front door and there was Matt in his blue polo. He gave me a wave and continued on to the back of the van. I didn’t notice anyone else in the van. Was another one coming. Is he going to do this entire install by himself? Sure enough Matt exited the back of the van with a ladder, tool belt and camera in hand. 

  


“I’m going to start on the front and back cameras then I can move on to the interior. If you have any errands to run feel free, this is going to take me a while.”

  


While I wasn’t too keen on the idea of leaving the house I did have some things to do. The kids were at school and my wife was at work. She was a manager at a department store and was able to make a lateral transfer to a store near our new home. I had to go to the post office and pick up some paint for my home office. I decided to take care of my plans and figured I’d be back within the hour. 

  


As I pulled back up to the house I saw Matt putting the ladder away. While I closed the car door Matt approached me. 

  


“Alright Phil the exterior is done, I was able to to install the doorbell camera as well. I’m ready to move on to the interior when you are!” He said excitedly

  


“Great, follow me and let me know if you need anything.”

  


I entered the house and Matt quickly followed behind. I headed towards the office while Matt started to set up the cameras and keypad. I wanted to get a head start on painting the office because I knew I started work the next day. 

  


About and hour and a half later, I had just finished applying the first coat when Matt called out to me. 

  


“Hey Phil! All done! Just have to install the app on your phone and you will be able to access the cameras, keypad, and locks directly from your phone.”

  


“Awesome, thanks again! Is there some place I can leave you a review or call your boss or anything? You’ve been great and I’d love to rave about you.” I said as I chuckled.

  


Matt turned to me suddenly. “No. Uh no it’s alright just doing my job.”

  


“Okay? Uhh anyway what’s the app?”

  


“May I?” Matt reached out his open hand.

  


I handed him the phone without thinking. I had a big day ahead and just wanted to be finished. Within 30 seconds Matt had downloaded the app and handed my phone back to me.

  


“All set! I put the app on your Home Screen! Click the big blue “P.A” and it will bring you to your door bell camera. You can cycle through each camera by clicking the camera icon. Your door can be unlocked with a push of the lock icon, and your keypad can be used by, you guessed it, clicking the keypad icon. I set your default code to your house number. To set it just hit “set” and then the code. To turn it off hit “off” and then the code. Pretty simple! Feel free to change it at anytime!”

  


“This is great, thanks again Matt.” I said as we walked towards the door. “ I’ll be sure to spread the word to all the neighbors!”

  


Matt stopped walking.

  


“No no, no need too I already dealt with most of the neighborhood so please don’t mention me.”

  


What a weirdo I thought to myself. “No problem, thanks again!” 

  


As Matt left I walked back to my office to put on the second coat of paint.

  


When my wife and kids got home, I showed them the new cameras and alarm system. The kids couldn’t care less but my wife was impressed with not only the price but the fast installation.

  


“So this guy Matt did all this today by himself? Damn thats pretty impressive.”

  


“That’s exactly what I was thinking. The app is great, I can unlock the door from anywhere and can check on the cameras when we aren’t home. You should download it too babe.” 

  


We looked it up on her phone but for some reason couldn’t find it. We searched up Pristine Alarms, P.A, even searched Alarm apps but couldn’t find anything. I told her I’d give Matt a call in the morning and get it figured out. 

  


I went to bed that night excited to start my new job but surprisingly I was able to fall asleep pretty fast. Unfortunately my rest only lasted for a few hours. We were woken up by the sound of a blaring siren. For a split second I had no idea what was happening. I jumped up from bed and ran straight to the door. “Did someone try to come in?” My wife said as I looked through the window. I saw nothing. I checked the back door and windows. Once again, nothing. Once I got my bearings I headed for the keypad. I hit the “off” button and put our house number in. The words “access denied” popped up on the screen. I tried again, same message. By this point my family was behind me and starting to get annoyed.

  


“Whats going on?” My wife said.

  


“I have no idea, it wont turn off, it keeps saying access denied.” 

  


“Here let me try.” 

  


“Hit the off button and then put our house number in.”

  


She did just that. The sirens stopped. I stood there confused. Did I enter it wrong? I mean I’m out of it, sure but I know I entered it in correctly. 

  


After our hearts stopped racing we all headed back to bed. On the way to work I was going to call Matt and figure out the alarm situation. 

  


I got ready and downed a cup of coffee. I was EXHAUSTED. I called him on the way to the office. One ring and then an answer.

  


“Hey Phil, I recognized your number. What can I do for you?”

  


“Hey Matt. We are having some trouble with the alarm. It went off randomly last night and when I entered the code it didn’t turn off.”

  


“Hmm, thats strange. I can come by and check it out. Maybe run a couple of tests.”

  


“Sure, what is a good time for you?”

  


“I know you said you had work today? Is anyone home right now? I have some time before my first job”

  


“Yeah my wife, I will call her and let her know you will be stopping by to fix the issue, i appreciate it.”

  


I called home and let my wife know Matt will be coming by. She was a little annoyed that she had to put on real clothes instead of pajamas but understood it needed to be done.

  


5 minutes later I got a notification on my phone that someone was at the front door. I opened the alarm app and saw the doorbell camera. It was Matt. That was fast. My wife opened the door and let Matt inside. I closed the app and headed into the office. 

  


On my lunch break I decided to call home. 

  


“Hey honey, hows your first day?” My wife asked.

  


“It is good darling, hows your day off? Did Matt fix the problem?”

  


“He is actually still here he said there was some sort of software issue.”

  


It had already been a few hours. He installed everything in less than 3. How does a software issue take more time. I told my wife I’d call her back. I wanted to know what was taking so long. I called Matt. No answer.

  


I called again. No answer.

  


What the hell is going on. The guy answers on the first ring every time I call. Now no answer at all. I decided to check the cameras. The front camera showed his van was still there. I cycled through the cameras. My wife was sitting on the couch watching t.v. I switch to the hallway camera. No sign of Matt. I was just about to switch to the back camera when I saw him. He was exiting our bedroom. I immediately called my wife.

  


“What the fuck is he doing in our room?!”

  


“What are you talking about he is by the keypad.”

  


“No he is not I just saw him walking out of our room!”

  


Thats when I got another call. It was Matt. I told my wife he was calling and I had to go.

  


“What the fuck do you think you’re doing walking around my house?”

  


“Phil I don’t appreciate you talking to me that way. For your information I was installing window sensors. I felt it was the least I can do for the inconvenience of the alarm going off last night.”

  


“Oh, uhh sorry, it just looked, well it just looked weird. You coming out of the bedroom like that.”

  


“Are you watching me Phil? Haha good to know the cameras work well. Don’t be concerned, the alarm is working perfectly now and your wife was great company. I’ll head out now. Enjoy your day Phil.”

  


“Uhh, thanks Matt sorry for blowing up like that.”

  


He had already hung up. 

  


After work I headed straight home, when the kids went to sleep I spoke to my wife about the window sensors. I told her he installed them free of charge. She was thankful but thought it was strange he didn’t mention it to her.

  


The next few days went smooth. Work was starting great, the family was settling in day by day and there weren’t any more issues with the alarm system. 

  


Until my wife and I decided to have a date night. 

  


We wanted to treat ourselves. The move was overwhelming and it was time for us to enjoy ourselves. We were just going out to dinner. The kids were old enough to be by themselves for a few hours plus we would be able to have eyes on them and the house with the cameras. 

  


We got all fancied up. We headed to a well reviewed steakhouse and were just enjoying each others company. That’s when I got a notification on my phone. “Front door unlocked.”

I looked at my wife puzzled and showed her my phone. She called the kids right away and I checked the doorbell camera. No one there. I was going through the other cameras and saw nothing. Then another notification. “Back door unlocked.” My wife was on the phone.

  


“Did you unlock the door?” She put it on speaker.

  


“No? We are doing homework and watching tv.”

  


“Check the doors make sure they are locked”

  


“Okay. I locked them. Is everything okay?”

  


“Yes everything is fine we just got a notification that the doors had been unlocked.”

  


She looked at me.

  


I said “Maybe the system is messing up again.”

  


“Maybe but I feel weird now, we should go.”

  


Just as I asked for the check. Another notification comes through. “There’s motion at the front door.” I check. No one there. I begin to check the cameras once again. Thats when I see the van. Matt’s van. What the hell?

  


“There’s motion at the back door.”

  


I cycle through. There is Matt standing by my back door.

  


“Back door unlocked.”

  


What the fuck.

  


I tell my wife we need to go now. 

  


“There’s motion at the front door.”

  


“Front door unlocked”

  


I call Matt. 

  


“Hello Phil”

  


“Matt what the fuck are you doing?”

  


“Just checking on you, I saw your car was gone and I just wanted to make sure everything was working as intended.”

  


“What? Why are you at my house? How are you unlocking my doors? Do you have acc-“

  


“Calm down Phil just doing my job. Everything looks great, I’m gonna take off now.”

  


I looked at my wife ”Call the cops, now!”

  


I rushed home, running through red lights and rolling through stop signs. 

  


When we arrived the police were already there. My wife ran to the kids and I stopped to talk to the officer. I explained the situation and what we were dealing with. The officer explained that it looked like we had a stalker on our hands and the best course of action was a restraining order. I only knew his first name and the company he worked for. The officer told me to look up the company number and describe to them the issues we were having. When I searched “Pristine Alarms” nothing came up. Not an app, not a website, not a phone number. I explained this to the officer. He looked confused. He explained without any information there wasn’t much he could do. He advised we stay in a hotel for a few nights until we could figure it out. I took his advice and I packed up the family and headed to a local hotel. 

  


My wife and the kids stayed “home” the next day. They were still shaken up which completely made sense. I on the other hand still had to work. I just started and had not yet built up any paid time off. It wasn’t until leaving the hotel for work that I realized I didn’t have my laptop. I forgot it in my home office. I needed it for work and it was on the way. I pulled into the drive way and ran in the house.

  


I ran to my office when the alarm started going off.

  


I ran to enter the code.

  


“Access denied”

  


I tried again.

  


“Access denied”

  


“There’s motion at the back door”

  


The siren stopped.

  


My phone rang.

  


“Hi there Phil, I see you’re home. Where were you last night? I wanted to come say hi to you and the wife but no one was here after the cops left.”

  


I didn’t say a word.

  


“Phil I can see you on the camera, you look tense. Relax bud I’m just making sure everything is alright. I just want to make sure everything is working as intended.”

  


“Who the fuck are you, “Pristine Alarms” isn’t even a real fucking company.”

  


“C’mon now Philly, I work hard at my job.”

  


“Listen you psycho, leave my family the fuck alone.”

  


“I just wanna make sure you’re safe.”

  


He hung up.

  


“Front door unlocked.”

  


I rushed to the front door ready to strangle this asshole. That’s when the back door swung open. 

  


By the time I turned around it was too late. The bat hit my ribs and I immediately collapsed to the ground. Matt was standing over me with the bat raised. The wind was knocked out of me but I had to do something. I kicked at his knee with enough force to make him drop the bat. I scampered to my feet but before I could do anything else to defend myself I heard the command.

  


“DON’T FUCKING MOVE!” The police must’ve been called by one of the neighbors.

  


My eyes locked on Matt as I saw him reaching for his phone.

  


Then the siren went off. While the officers were flustered Matt rose to his feet and sprinted out the back door. The officers gave chase but returned without Matt. That psychopath got away. I was  questioned by the police and after some slight investigation they began to take my report of what happened. After the information was gathered I planned on calling my wife to inform her of the chaos that just ensued. That’s when I noticed the all too familiar “Pristine Alarms” van parked down the street. I approached it curious to see what was inside. Maybe Matt was hiding out in there, maybe there would be SOMETHING that can show me who he really was. 

  


I opened the back door of the van. There it was. His control room. He had a monitor for every camera installed in my house. Buttons and switches for every time he wanted to unlock the doors, turn off the alarm, or set off a camera.

Why the fuck was he so obsessed with us. 

  


My phone rang.

  


I answered.

Thats when I got another call. It was Matt. I told my wife he was calling and I had to go.

  


“What the fuck do you think you’re doing walking around my house?”

  


“Phil I don’t appreciate you talking to me that way. For your information I was installing window sensors. I felt it was the least I can do for the inconvenience of the alarm going off last night.”

  


“Oh, uhh sorry, it just looked, well it just looked weird. You coming out of the bedroom like that.”

  


“Are you watching me Phil? Haha good to know the cameras work well. Don’t be concerned, the alarm is working perfectly now and your wife was great company. I’ll head out now. Enjoy your day Phil.”

  


“Uhh, thanks Matt sorry for blowing up like that.”

  


He had already hung up. 

  


After work I headed straight home, when the kids went to sleep I spoke to my wife about the window sensors. I told her he installed them free of charge. She was thankful but thought it was strange he didn’t mention it to her.

  


The next few days went smooth. Work was starting great, the family was settling in day by day and there weren’t any more issues with the alarm system. 

  


Until my wife and I decided to have a date night. 

  


We wanted to treat ourselves. The move was overwhelming and it was time for us to enjoy ourselves. We were just going out to dinner. The kids were old enough to be by themselves for a few hours plus we would be able to have eyes on them and the house with the cameras. 

  


We got all fancied up. We headed to a well reviewed steakhouse and were just enjoying each others company. That’s when I got a notification on my phone. “Front door unlocked.”

I looked at my wife puzzled and showed her my phone. She called the kids right away and I checked the doorbell camera. No one there. I was going through the other cameras and saw nothing. Then another notification. “Back door unlocked.” My wife was on the phone.

  


“Did you unlock the door?” She put it on speaker.

  


“No? We are doing homework and watching tv.”

  


“Check the doors make sure they are locked”

  


“Okay. I locked them. Is everything okay?”

  


“Yes everything is fine we just got a notification that the doors had been unlocked.”

  


She looked at me.

  


I said “Maybe the system is messing up again.”

  


“Maybe but I feel weird now, we should go.”

  


Just as I asked for the check. Another notification comes through. “There’s motion at the front door.” I check. No one there. I begin to check the cameras once again. Thats when I see the van. Matt’s van. What the hell?

  


“There’s motion at the back door.”

  


I cycle through. There is Matt standing by my back door.

  


“Back door unlocked.”

  


What the fuck.

  


I tell my wife we need to go now. 

  


“There’s motion at the front door.”

  


“Front door unlocked”

  


I call Matt. 

  


“Hello Phil”

  


“Matt what the fuck are you doing?”

  


“Just checking on you, I saw your car was gone and I just wanted to make sure everything was working as intended.”

  


“What? Why are you at my house? How are you unlocking my doors? Do you have acc-“

  


“Calm down Phil just doing my job. Everything looks great, I’m gonna take off now.”

  


I looked at my wife ”Call the cops, now!”

  


I rushed home, running through red lights and rolling through stop signs. 

  


When we arrived the police were already there. My wife ran to the kids and I stopped to talk to the officer. I explained the situation and what we were dealing with. The officer explained that it looked like we had a stalker on our hands and the best course of action was a restraining order. I only knew his first name and the company he worked for. The officer told me to look up the company number and describe to them the issues we were having. When I searched “Pristine Alarms” nothing came up. Not an app, not a website, not a phone number. I explained this to the officer. He looked confused. He explained without any information there wasn’t much he could do. He advised we stay in a hotel for a few nights until we could figure it out. I took his advice and I packed up the family and headed to a local hotel. 

  


My wife and the kids stayed “home” the next day. They were still shaken up which completely made sense. I on the other hand still had to work. I just started and had not yet built up any paid time off. It wasn’t until leaving the hotel for work that I realized I didn’t have my laptop. I forgot it in my home office. I needed it for work and it was on the way. I pulled into the drive way and ran in the house.

  


I ran to my office when the alarm started going off.

  


I ran to enter the code.

  


“Access denied”

  


I tried again.

  


“Access denied”

  


“There’s motion at the back door”

  


The siren stopped.

  


My phone rang.

  


“Hi there Phil, I see you’re home. Where were you last night? I wanted to come say hi to you and the wife but no one was here after the cops left.”

  


I didn’t say a word.

  


“Phil I can see you on the camera, you look tense. Relax bud I’m just making sure everything is alright. I just want to make sure everything is working as intended.”

  


“Who the fuck are you, “Pristine Alarms” isn’t even a real fucking company.”

  


“C’mon now Philly, I work hard at my job.”

  


“Listen you psycho, leave my family the fuck alone.”

  


“I just wanna make sure you’re safe.”

  


He hung up.

  


“Front door unlocked.”

  


I rushed to the front door ready to strangle this asshole. That’s when the back door swung open. 

  


By the time I turned around it was too late. The bat hit my ribs and I immediately collapsed to the ground. Matt was standing over me with the bat raised. The wind was knocked out of me but I had to do something. I kicked at his knee with enough force to make him drop the bat. I scampered to my feet but before I could do anything else to defend myself I heard the command.

  


“DON’T FUCKING MOVE!” The police must’ve been called by one of the neighbors.

  


My eyes locked on Matt as I saw him reaching for his phone.

  


Then the siren went off. While the officers were flustered Matt rose to his feet and sprinted out the back door. The officers gave chase but returned without Matt. That psychopath got away. I was  questioned by the police and after some slight investigation they began to take my report of what happened. After the information was gathered I planned on calling my wife to inform her of the chaos that just ensued. That’s when I noticed the all too familiar “Pristine Alarms” van parked down the street. I approached it curious to see what was inside. Maybe Matt was hiding out in there, maybe there would be SOMETHING that can show me who he really was. 

  


I opened the back door of the van. There it was. His control room. He had a monitor for every camera installed in my house. Buttons and switches for every time he wanted to unlock the doors, turn off the alarm, or set off a camera.

Why the fuck was he so obsessed with us. 

  


My phone rang.

  


I answered.

Now it's time for me to find a match. Here's about me

I [M22] recently moved to Bangalore and am excited to meet new people, build connections, and explore the city. I’d describe myself as a non-judgmental person with a decent sense of humour who believes in finding happiness in the little things— a warm cup of coffee, a friendly dog, or a pretty sunset can make my day. 
My life so far has been a mix of failures, learnings, and successes, and I’m grateful for all of it. I’m career-oriented but also believe that work is just one part of life—not the whole of it. I can be a couch potato or an explorer depending on the day. 
Web series, card games, cooking, and TMKOC are my favourite ways to unwind. I’m a selective extrovert—if we share some common interests, I’d love to spend time together. I enjoy trekking, cracking jokes, and completely lose track of time when I’m around dogs—they’re the purest examples of love and loyalty. 
Hitting the gym at the end of the day helps me relax my mind and soul. I’m a big fan of 90s songs and movies that revolve around deep emotions and genuine connections. Empathy and open-mindedness mean a lot to me, and I don’t enjoy negative or overly judgmental company

I down a pot of coffee, get ready to face the day  
As for my attitude, momentarily I have nothing much to say

No beginning to adventure with a slow ride in a hearse  
Trying to stay positive in this world full of lies  
Taking life too seriously will only make you cry

You never are for certain what may lie ahead  
All this negativity eventually will pass

All I wanted was to drive straight into their venue and kill us all.
I was about to floor it when my phone wouldn't stop buzzing.
I picked up. It's the hospital.
""Miss Kingston, you're pregnant.""
I killed the engine. Froze.
Thirty minutes later, I started the car again. 
But this time, I turned around and drove straight to the airport.
Just like that, the fake heiress everyone wanted gone vanished from New York.
I fled to Austin, a thousand miles away. 
Almost died having my baby girl. But we made it.
And never talked to any of them again.
Not until four years later, when they all came crawling back.

Four years later, I ran into Cade Sullivan picking up kids from school.

I'd just gotten Maya when another mom came over.

""Oh my god, Maya's mom, look—that guy across the street. Isn't he that singer? God, what's his name again...""

I looked where she was pointing and stopped dead.

""Cade!"" She snapped her fingers. ""That's him!""

I looked away. ""Never heard of him.""

She stared at me. ""Wait, you don't listen to music? Cade! He's been huge the past few years—singer-songwriter, tons of awards!""

She leaned closer, squinting at me. ""Actually... you two kind of look alike. Both gorgeous...""

I smiled and shook my head, taking Maya's hand as we kept walking.

But then I heard his voice behind me.

""Sasha.""

I didn't stop.

""Sasha Kingston!""

Maya looked up. ""Mommy, is that man calling you? Why's he saying Sasha Kingston?""

I shook my head. ""Wrong person, sweetie.""

But when we got to the parking lot and I reached for the car door, someone grabbed my arm.

I turned around—

Cade, out of breath.

""Sasha, you... you're actually alive?""

Same old Cade. Still a total asshole.

Maybe he'd run too fast, because his eyes were red.

I dropped Maya off with the neighbor.

When I came back down, Cade was standing there with his hands in his pockets.

""Why are you living in this shithole? Where's your place? I'm coming up.""

I shook my head. ""Don't bother.""

Four years ago, he made it pretty clear—his only sister was Ivy Sullivan.

He also made it clear that calling me his sister made him sick.

When Garrett Kingston kicked me out, when Rhys Callahan dumped me, when I had nowhere to go, I thought about asking my actual brother for help.

I stood outside his office all night in a snowstorm. Nearly froze to death.

What did I get? Him telling me he wished I'd never been born.

""If you didn't exist, Ivy wouldn't have been switched at birth. She wouldn't have suffered.""

""Sister? That's hilarious. The Kingstons don't want you, so now you're trying to guilt-trip me?""

""I'd never call someone like you my sister.""

That's when I got it—didn't matter how good I was to him. He hated me because of Ivy.

Now he was staring at me with that same look.

""That kid... she's Rhys's, right? You ran off to have his baby?""

I didn't say anything for a second. ""She's my daughter. Mine.""

He smirked. ""Come on, Sasha, that kid's a carbon copy of him. You think I'm blind?""

""Wait, did you really think having his baby would make him come back to you? That's some delusional romantic nonsense...""

""It's pathetic. Absolutely pathetic...""

""I said she's my daughter. Mine."" I cut him off.

""I never planned on going back to New York. Never planned on using my kid to steal Rhys from your precious Ivy. So relax. And quit coming at me like this.""

""Like you said back then—we share blood, that's it. We're strangers. I don't care about your life, so don't try to run mine.""

He just stared at me.

""If that's all, leave.""

""Wait."" He grabbed my arm again.

Opened his mouth. Then closed.

""You... you...""

I frowned. ""What?""

""Why'd you even leave back then...""

I just looked at him.

""You were this spoiled rich girl who couldn't do anything. So people talked sh//it about you—big deal. Why'd you have to run off and do this whole single-mom thing?""

""If I hadn't found you, how long were you gonna keep living like this? And these past four years...""

He stopped.

""H-How'd you even survive?""

I looked at his eyes, red around the edges again.

Probably pissed.

He's probably shocked I'm still breathing. And me being alive? That's a threat to Ivy's perfect life.

How did I survive?

Someone died so I could.

But he doesn't need to know that.

The old Sasha was like some useless hothouse flower.

The new me? I stopped crying on people's shoulders a long time ago.

When I didn't answer, he got more worked up.

""What the HELL, why are you acting so weird now? Did that massive earthquake in Austin a few years back mess up your brain or something?""

""Running off to some middle-of-nowhere place like this—you had an earthquake coming.""

Just then, a neighbor walked by and waved. ""Hey, Wren, haven't started dinner yet?""

I smiled. ""About to.""

Cade froze.

""You should go,"" I said.

But he wouldn't let go of my arm.

""Wait, why'd you change your name? Wren? Did you get married? Whose name is that?""

""None of your business.""

I pulled free, saying it slow so he'd get it.

""What my name is, how I'm doing, Cade—none of your business.""

Cade's a celebrity.

No way he's making a scene in public.

I went upstairs, got Maya, and looked out the window. He was still down there, staring up.

He never cared about me before. His confusion now? Probably just thrown off because I'm not kissing his butt anymore.

Four years ago, after I found out he wanted to be a musician, I used up every connection I had just to get him one shot on stage.

His agency—I'm the one who got him signed.

He's my brother. He'd been through he//ll. I wanted him to do well.

But he twisted all of it, said I was manipulative, trying to make Ivy miserable.

""Mommy, was that man your family?""

I blinked, then smiled and touched her hair. ""No, baby. Why would you think that?""

""Just guessing. You look alike.""

Family?

Garrett's face flashed through my mind.

I used to think no matter what, blood or not, Garrett would always be my brother.

But four years ago, he held Ivy after she ""fell"" down the stairs and looked at me like I was garbage.

""Sasha, you've disappointed me for the last time.""

""Starting today, you're not part of the Kingston family. You're not my sister.""

""My only sister is Ivy.""

I cried, grabbed his leg, begged him not to leave me. Swore I didn't push her.

But he kicked me off and walked away.

I shook my head. ""He's not my family, sweetie.""

She looked sad. ""I thought maybe you had someone besides Uncle.""

I tapped her nose. ""Mommy's got you and Uncle. That's enough.""

""But Uncle's gone..."" Her lip shook. ""I miss him.""

I got it. I really did.

But disappointment? That's better than having something, then losing it.

Better than depending on someone, then having them ripped away.

I'd lived through that. I wasn't letting my daughter go through it too.

Still, I didn't expect it.

The next day, I saw Garrett.

Maya got a fever in the middle of the night.

I took her to the hospital. Bad viral infection—she had to stay for an IV.

By morning, her fever finally broke, but she was wiped. I carried her on my back and stopped at a street vendor on the way home to grab groceries.

I'd just paid when someone took the bags from me—long fingers, sharp knuckles.

I looked up. Through the early fog, I saw Garrett's face.

I was so tired I could barely think. I accidentally called him what I used to.

Then I caught myself. He didn't let me call him that anymore.

The Kingstons? Yeah, I couldn't piss them off.

Four years ago, one sentence from Garrett got me blacklisted everywhere.

""Mr. Kingston,"" I said instead.

I was too busy wondering why he was in Austin to notice how his face went stiff.

""Let me carry this,"" he said quietly.

""I'm good."" I reached for the bags but lost my balance. Maya made a sound on my back.

""Don't push yourself, Sash."" He caught my arm. ""I'll take you both home.""

Sash.

Garrett hadn't called me that in forever.

Our parents were always overseas, so Garrett basically raised me.

When he still saw me as his sister, he spoiled me.

Someone once asked if he worried I'd get him in trouble.

He'd just grinned. ""So what if she does? She wants to cause trouble, let her. Whatever happens, I'll handle it.""

But then Ivy came back.

At first, he still said I'd always be his sister.

But every time Ivy messed with me, he'd tell me to let it go.

""She's been through a lot, Sash. Just give her some space.""

He said we had to make it up to her.

I didn't want to make things hard for him. He'd been my brother for over twenty years. I wanted him happy.

So I gave in. Over and over.

Until he believed Ivy's lies without question, and I finally got it—I saw him as my brother, but he'd stopped seeing me as his sister a long time ago.

And when he took back every bit of care he'd ever given me, when I was drowning and everyone turned on me, that's when I realized how stupid I'd been to depend on him.

We didn't talk the whole ride.

Hadn't been in a car this nice in years. I felt out of place, so I just held Maya close and kept to my side of the seat, trying to figure out why Garrett was even here—

Did Cade tell him?

Was he scared I'd hurt Ivy, so he came to check?

What would he do?

Punish me for having Rhys's kid?

I didn't know. My head was killing me. I held Maya tighter, completely missing how he kept looking at me—like he'd been dying to see me.

""Sash...""

I looked up.

There were new lines around his eyes.

""Four years ago, we all thought you were...""

""Dead. I know."" I cut him off. ""And honestly, you can just keep thinking that. I'm not trying to compete with Ivy. Everything was hers anyway. I'm fine with that. You don't need to be paranoid or check on me. I just want to live quietly with my daughter.""

""And my daughter's staying with me. She's not going to Rhys. I swear I won't use her to mess up Ivy and Rhys. So relax.""

Then I looked him in the eye.

""You can really relax.""

He froze.

""I'm not—""

""Or are you scared I'll use the Kingston name? I won't. I changed my name years ago...""

""Sash!"" He cut me off, voice breaking.

His eyes were red.

""I... I want you to come home...""

I didn't get what Garrett was thinking.

I wasn't part of the Kingston family anymore.

He's the one who said so four years ago.

And what would I even go back for? To be Ivy's punching bag again?

I also didn't get why someone as rich as him had to follow me back to my tiny apartment.

I laid Maya down in bed, then headed to the kitchen. I reached for the instant coffee, then paused—no way someone like him would drink my shitty three-dollar coffee.

So I got him water instead.

He looked down at my right hand. His face did something—I couldn't tell what.

""How's your hand?""

I looked down.

My right hand—my pinky and ring finger didn't move anymore.

It happened after Ivy came back.

We went to tour one of the Kingston factories. She got curious, started talking to an engineer about machinery. To prove her point, she hit the power button on a test device.

My hand was right there.

Before that, I was a rising piano star.

It was the one thing I had over Ivy. I wasn't as smart, wasn't as capable—but piano? That was mine.

When Ivy first came back, every time I practiced, she'd sigh.

""I've always loved music. If I hadn't been switched at birth, I'd be playing piano too.""

But after that day, I couldn't perform anymore.

I spiraled. Didn't want to live.

I was sure she did it on purpose. I hated her for taking my one thing.

Until she tried to kill herself.

After they saved her, I went from victim to villain.

I remember Garrett coming back after seeing her, rubbing his face, exhausted.

""It's just piano, Sash. Just two fingers. Did you really have to push her to this?""

""Even if you can't play, even if you're not my real sister, didn't I say the Kingstons would take care of you? Why are you doing this?""

Cade was colder. ""If you hadn't been switched, Ivy would've been the one playing. You're just giving back what you stole. Why are you throwing a fit?""

They all said my hand would never heal. That crying wouldn't fix it.

But later, at Ivy's party celebrating a patent for the same machine that crushed my fingers, I heard a doctor talking to Garrett.

""I told you back then—if Miss Kingston got treatment abroad right away, she could've recovered most of the function. But you never took her. Now it's too late.""

Garrett's voice was ice-cold. ""It's better this way. Ivy always wanted to learn piano. Seeing Sash unable to play probably makes her feel better.""

""I'll take care of Sash either way. Doesn't matter if she plays or not.""

So my dreams, my future—to him, they were just tools to keep Ivy happy.

When did I start being scared of him?

Probably right then.

""I heard you're teaching music now,"" he said suddenly.

I stiffened, eyes wide.

""I only teach beginner stuff to little kids. Simple music. I don't need my ring finger or pinky for that.""

""I'm not trying to get back on stage. I'd never do anything to upset Ivy. I just need this job to feed my kid. And doctors said my hand's permanently messed up. I'll never play well again. So even if that's true, you still won't let me work?""

He froze. ""Sash, that's not—""

But I wasn't listening anymore.

The fear of having my life destroyed again hit me. I couldn't lose this job because Ivy was unhappy. So I held up my hand, showing him the fingers that wouldn't move.

""Look! I can't play anymore! I gave everything back to the Kingstons!""

""If you don't believe me, go ahead—try to move them. They don't work!""

""I was your sister for years. Can't you just let me survive?""

He jumped up, panicked, and grabbed my shaking shoulders.

""Sash, don't be scared. Please.""

""This time I'll protect you. I swear. Trust me.""

But how could I not be scared?

I'd finally rebuilt my life—the life Kai Wren traded his own for me and Maya.

""NO!""

I shoved him hard.

But the more I fought, the tighter he held me.

And then, suddenly, everything went black.",1,1762659083.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False
1os8vkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1os8vkj/the_monterrazas_controversy_a_timeline_of/,"The Monterrazas Controversy: A Timeline of Development, Warnings, and Disaster","**TL;DR:** The Rise at Monterrazas, a luxury hillside development in Cebu City linked to celebrity engineer Slater Young, is now under investigation after Typhoon Tino caused catastrophic flooding in November 2025. The controversy has deep roots—dating back to 2007—with multiple cease-and-desist orders, environmental concerns, and warnings from officials that were repeatedly ignored. This post maps out the key corporate players and executives behind the project.

**The Key Players: Who's Behind the Companies**

Before diving into the timeline, it's crucial to understand **who controls** these companies and **who profits** from the development:

**8990 Holdings, Inc. (Current Owner since 2019)**

Founded in 2005 as a mass housing developer, 8990 Holdings was built by three partners who turned it into a property empire worth over $1 billion:​

* **Luis N. Yu Jr.** — Founder and Chairman Emeritus. Owns/controls **44.24%** of 8990 Holdings. As of August 2023, Forbes listed his net worth at **$495 million**. An MBA graduate from the Asian Institute of Management with over 30 years in mass housing.​
* **Mariano ""Marin"" D. Martinez Jr.** — Chairman of the Board. Owns **19.91%** of the company. BS in Business Management from De La Salle University. A veteran with over two decades in low-cost housing and former national president of the Subdivision and Housing Development Association (SHDA).​
* **Januario Jesus ""JJ"" Gregorio Atencio III** — Co-founder and former President/CEO (retired end of 2017). Owned **10.37%** of 8990 Holdings. BA in Psychology from Ateneo de Manila, with further studies at Wharton. Brought over 20 years of mass housing experience and also served as national president of SHDA and private sector representative to the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council.​
* **Atty. Anthony Vincent S. Sotto** — Current President and CEO (appointed September 2021). Holds a Bachelor of Laws from the University of the Philippines, admitted to the Bar in 2001. Joined 8990 in 2003 as assistant general manager, promoted to general manager in 2011, then Deputy CEO in June 2019 before becoming President/CEO. He was the one who announced the Monterrazas Prime joint venture with Slater Young in August 2021.​
* **Alexander ""Ace"" S. Sotto** — Chief Operating Officer. Former President/CEO who stepped down in September 2021 to focus on operations.​
* **Roan Buenaventura-Torregoza** — Chief Financial Officer and Director.

**In February 2019, 8990 Holdings acquired 72.83% (later reported as 100%) of Genvi Development Corporation for ₱2.337 billion**, paying an additional ₱526.47 million in goodwill. This marked 8990's entry into the high-end property market—a dramatic shift from their core business of low-cost mass housing for Filipino workers.

**Genvi Development Corporation (2003-2019)**

Genvi was originally incorporated in 1974 as **Genvi Agro-Industrial Development Corporation** by **Doña Genoveva S. Villalon**, matriarch of the prominent Cebuano Villalon family. Doña Genoveva was the granddaughter of **Nicasio Ch. Veloso**, one of Cebu's most prominent businessmen at the turn of the 20th century. She amassed nearly 2,000 hectares of land from the 1930s through the 1970s in Cebu and Manila.

In 2003, two of her grandchildren took control:

* **Augusto ""Toti"" Fabella Villalon** — President and General Manager of Genvi Development Corporation. An acclaimed architect, cultural heritage planner, and owner of A. Villalon Architects. He was a UNESCO Asia-Pacific Cultural Heritage Award recipient (2003, 2005), received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Heritage Conservation from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, and served as President of ICOMOS Philippine Committee and member of its International Advisory Committee. He was also president of **Gota de Leche**, the Philippines' oldest NGO (founded 1906), which feeds malnourished children. **Toti Villalon passed away on May 5, 2018** at age 73, before 8990 Holdings acquired the company.​
* **Margarita ""Marga"" Villalon-Binamira** — Executive Vice President and Treasurer of Genvi Development Corporation. **The youngest of six Villalon siblings, she worked alongside her brother Toti to develop Monterrazas ""by Cebuanos, for Cebuanos""**.

The Villalon siblings took over the project from Landco Pacific Corporation in **early 2010**, ending their joint venture agreement. They emphasized hiring Cebuano consultants, designers, and engineers, believing that locals understood the Cebuano lifestyle better than Manila-based firms.​

Their stated philosophy was ""thinking locally, acting globally""—combining international development standards with Cebuano heritage and values. They promised to replant forests on cleared slopes and adopted Banawa Elementary School as part of community engagement.​

**However, their tenure was marked by repeated flooding incidents, environmental violations, and cease-and-desist orders in 2008 and 2011.**

**Landco Pacific Corporation (Original Partner, 2007-2010)**

Landco Pacific Corporation was the **original joint venture partner** with Genvi that secured the project's **Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) on May 30, 2007**. Landco is a subsidiary of **Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC)**, led by business tycoon **Manuel V. Pangilinan** (""MVP"").​

Key Landco executives:​​

* **Manuel V. Pangilinan** — Chairman and CEO of MPIC, concurrent Chairman of Landco Pacific Corporation. Recognized as **2024 Philippines Real Estate Personality of the Year** by PropertyGuru.​
* **Erickson Y. Manzano** — President and CEO of Landco Pacific Corporation (appointed November 2015). Previously held senior positions at Century Properties Inc., SM Prime Holdings, Shang Properties, and Ayala Land (where he was General Manager of NUVALI).​​

The partnership between Landco and Genvi ended in **early 2010**. The Villalon siblings took full control, stating they wanted the development to be ""more Cebuano"" and criticized Landco for being ""Manila-based"" and unfamiliar with Cebu.​

**Critically, the ECC was issued in Landco's name for a housing subdivision with individual houses—NOT the high-rise condominium buildings that currently exist**. This discrepancy is now central to the investigation.

**Mont Property Group (Rebranded Genvi, 2019-Present)**

After 8990 Holdings acquired Genvi in 2019, the company was rebranded as **Mont Property Group**. The management shifted from the Villalon family's heritage-focused approach to 8990's profit-driven mass housing model, though now targeting the luxury market.

**Slater Young and SkyEstates Construction Corp.**

**Jan Slater Lee Young** is the celebrity face of the project—but it's important to understand his **exact role and financial stake**:​

* Winner of *Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited* (2012), turned engineer, entrepreneur, and social media influencer​
* In **August 2021**, 8990 Holdings announced a **joint venture** between Young's **SkyEstates Construction Corp.**, **LLG Architects**, and **Genvi Development Corp.** (now Mont Property Group) to develop **Monterrazas Prime**, a luxury house-and-lot project with units priced ₱40-50 million​
* In **October 2021**, Young was named **brand ambassador** for 8990 Holdings​
* He serves as **Chief Strategy Officer** for Mont Property Group​
* He is the lead **""industry partner""** for **The Rise at Monterrazas** condominium project​

**Important distinction:** Slater Young **does not own** Mont Property Group or 8990 Holdings. He is a **hired partner and brand ambassador**—essentially the public face for projects developed by the Martinez-Yu corporate empire. However, his prominent role in marketing and defending the project has made him the target of public anger.​

# Where It Started: The Early Years (2007-2011)

The story of Monterrazas de Cebu begins in **2007**, when **Landco Pacific Corporation and Genvi Development Corporation** received an **Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC)** from the Environmental Management Bureau Region 7 on **May 30, 2007**. The 200-hectare development covering Barangays Guadalupe, Sapangdaku, Buhisan, and Tisa was meant to be a joint venture leveraging the Villalon family's land and Landco's development expertise.​

The original ECC was issued for a housing project featuring individual houses and lots—**not the condominium buildings that exist today**. This discrepancy would later become a point of contention.​

**First Warning Signs (2008):**

On **April 15, 2008**, then-Mayor **Tomas Osmeña** revoked Monterrazas' development permit after a major flood and mudslide hit at least 10 families in Guadalupe. The flooding was blamed on the development's alteration of natural waterways and inadequate drainage systems. Mayor Osmeña ordered the developer to build **retention ponds** to hold back runoff water before any work could continue.​

Despite compliance efforts, the development permit wasn't reinstated until **November 15, 2009**. The reinstatement came with strict conditions: monthly progress reports, an operations manual for the retarding dam, and regular city government inspections. However, as city planning officer Gemma Camomot later admitted, **""no regular inspections were made""**—only occasional checks to see if the detention pond was working.​

**Second Cease-and-Desist Order (2011):**

By this time, **Genvi Development Corporation under Augusto ""Toti"" Villalon and Margarita Villalon** had taken full control after ending the Landco partnership.​

History repeated itself on **July 21, 2011**, when Mayor **Mike Rama** signed another cease-and-desist order against Genvi Development Corporation. Heavy monsoon rains sent water, silt, and mud rushing down to eight sitios in Barangay Guadalupe, affecting about 100 families. In Sitio Dakit alone, floodwaters reached **more than six feet deep**.​

Mayor Rama observed the flooding firsthand during a site visit and declared that households below Monterrazas were at **""high risk""** of waist-deep flooding during heavy rain. The order noted that **trees and vegetation had been bulldozed**, worsening soil erosion, and that culverts downhill weren't large enough to handle the increased volume of runoff water.​

Despite these warnings, work eventually resumed.

# Corporate Takeover: The Martinez-Yu Acquisition (2019)

In **February 2019**, the landscape changed dramatically when **8990 Holdings Inc.**—controlled by **Luis Yu Jr. (44.24%)** and **Mariano Martinez Jr. (19.91%)**—acquired 72.83% (later 100%) of Genvi Development Corporation for **₱2.337 billion**. This acquisition marked 8990's entry into the high-end property market—a significant shift from their core business of affordable mass housing.​

The company rebranded Genvi as **Mont Property Group** and began accelerating development of the stalled project.​

**Why did the Villalon family sell?** While not publicly stated, the repeated flooding problems, cease-and-desist orders, and environmental controversies likely made it difficult to continue. The 2018 death of Toti Villalon, the driving force behind the project, may have also influenced the decision.

# Slater Young Joins as Industry Partner (2021)

In **August 2021**, **8990 Holdings President/CEO Anthony Vincent Sotto** announced a joint venture with **Slater Young's SkyEstates Construction Corp.** and **LLG Architects** to develop **Monterrazas Prime**, a luxury house-and-lot project with units priced between ₱40-50 million.​

By **October 2021**, Young was officially named **brand ambassador** for 8990 Holdings. His role expanded beyond marketing—he became the **Chief Strategy Officer** for Mont Property Group and the lead **industry partner** for the signature project: **The Rise at Monterrazas**.​

**The Rise at Monterrazas: Design and Controversy (2023-2024):**

The Rise at Monterrazas is a **19-story residential condominium** built into the mountainside, inspired by the Banaue Rice Terraces. Young emphasized that the design went through **""around 300 revisions""** to ensure sustainability and compliance with environmental standards.​

Despite these assurances, environmental concerns resurfaced in **August 2023** when prominent lawyer **Jesus Falcis** publicly questioned the project on social media. Falcis asked critical questions about **how many trees were cleared**, whether the project's rainwater collection could compensate for natural water retention, and **how this would affect flooding in Guadalupe Heights**.​

His prescient warning from two years ago is now being widely circulated: *""I am just curious given the renewed controversy sa Monterrazas de Cebu""*

# Typhoon Tino and the Disaster (November 2025)

On **November 2, 2025**, Tropical Cyclone Kalmaegi (local name **Tino**) entered Philippine waters as a tropical storm and quickly intensified into a typhoon. Between November 2-6, Tino made multiple landfalls across the Visayas, bringing torrential rains and destructive winds.​

**The Devastating Impact:**

Cebu Province was among the hardest hit. As of **November 6-7, 2025**, the death toll stood at:

* **108-111 deaths in Cebu Province alone**
* **153-224 deaths nationwide** (numbers varied as bodies were recovered)​
* **86-135 people missing**
* **Over 2.4 million people affected**
* **302,008 people in evacuation centers**

In **Barangay Guadalupe**, where Monterrazas is located, flooding reached **waist-deep levels**. The floodwaters were described as **""mocha-colored""**, suggesting **traces of limestone (anapog)** from upland soil disturbance. Communities that had **never experienced flooding before** were suddenly submerged.​

The Sangguniang Kabataan of Barangay Guadalupe noted that flooding along **Banawa Creek**—near MHAM College of Medicine and Bo's Coffee Banawa—spread downstream to **Labangon, Tisa, and Mambaling**.

# Public Backlash and Slater Young's Silence

As images of devastation spread across social media, public anger turned toward Monterrazas and Slater Young. Netizens resurfaced Jesus Falcis's 2023 warnings and blamed the hillside development for disrupting natural water flow.​

**Restricting Comments:**

Both Slater Young and his wife, content creator **Kryz Uy**, reportedly **limited comments** on their Facebook and Instagram accounts as criticism intensified.​

**Albie Casiño Calls Out Young:**

On **November 7, 2025**, actor and fellow *Pinoy Big Brother* alum **Albie Casiño** publicly called out Young's silence on his Instagram Stories:​

>

Casiño referenced Young's 2023 statement: *""Narinig namin lahat ng mga concerns ninyo… our goal here is to listen""*—a promise that now rings hollow in the wake of the disaster.​

**Notably absent from public discourse:** The actual owners—**Luis Yu Jr., Mariano Martinez Jr., and 8990 Holdings President Anthony Vincent Sotto**—have remained completely silent. All public criticism has focused on Slater Young, the visible ""face"" of the project, while the corporate executives who profit from it have avoided accountability.

# Government Investigations and Cebu City Records

**DENR Multi-Agency Investigation (Launched November 7, 2025):**

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources formed a **Joint Inspection, Investigation, and Assessment Team** composed of:​

* DENR Region 7
* Environmental Management Bureau (EMB-7)
* Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB-7)
* Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) Cebu
* Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) Cebu City
* Cebu City Government
* Barangay Guadalupe officials

The investigation is examining:

* Compliance with the ECC and environmental regulations
* Effectiveness of drainage, slope protection, and runoff management systems
* Slope stability and landslide/flooding risks
* Alterations to natural landforms and proximity to timberland areas
* Evidence of erosion, siltation, or obstructions in nearby waterways

The DENR has directed the developer to submit its **Engineering, Geological, and Geohazard Assessment** for validation.​

**DPWH Investigation (Announced November 6, 2025):**

DPWH Secretary **Vince Dizon** announced that his agency, together with the **Independent Commission for Infrastructure**, would investigate **all flood control projects in Cebu from 2016 to 2025**.​

According to DPWH records, there were:

* **343 flood control projects (2016-2022)**
* **168 projects (2023-2025)**
* **2 cancelled projects**
* **55 ongoing projects**

Secretary Dizon stated: *""Klaro na hindi naging epektibo kung anuman ang ginawa nilang flood control project sa Cebu nitong nakaraang sampung taon""* (It's clear that whatever flood control projects were done in Cebu in the past ten years were not effective).​

**Barangay Guadalupe Resolution No. 25-145 (Approved November 5, 2025):**

The Sangguniang Kabataan of Barangay Guadalupe, led by SK Chairperson **Matt Estenzo**, unanimously passed a resolution calling for a comprehensive technical inspection of Monterrazas.​

The resolution cited:

* Multiple reports from affected sitios that Monterrazas' retention ponds and drainage systems ""may have contributed to unusually high volumes of surface runoff""
* Downstream communities experienced **""significant flooding, soil saturation, and slope instability""** linked to upstream development​
* The requirement under **Republic Act 7160 (Local Government Code)** for barangays to protect the environment and safeguard residents​

The resolution requests:

* Technical inspection of all retention ponds and drainage infrastructure
* Assessment of pond capacity and environmental compliance
* Public dialogue where developers present all permits, drainage plans, and flood mitigation measures​

**Environmental Compliance Certificate Concerns:**

Investigations revealed that the original **2007 ECC** was issued to **Landco Pacific Corporation** for a housing subdivision with individual houses—**not for the high-rise condominium currently under construction**. This raises questions about whether the current project required a **new ECC** to reflect the substantial changes in design and scope.​

# Financial Stakes: Who Profits?

The financial implications are significant. According to 8990 Holdings' 2024 annual report, Monterrazas de Cebu generated:

* **₱703.3 million in revenue (2023)** with a net profit of ₱153.6 million
* **₱476.5 million in revenue (2024)** with a net loss of ₱22.4 million
* Combined revenue of over ₱1.1 billion (2023-2024)

The company paid **₱526.47 million in goodwill** when acquiring the project in 2019.​

**Who benefits?** The primary beneficiaries are:

* **Luis Yu Jr.** (44.24% ownership, net worth $495 million)​
* **Mariano Martinez Jr.** (19.91% ownership)​
* **8990 Holdings shareholders and executives**

Slater Young, as an industry partner and brand ambassador, likely receives compensation and potentially profit-sharing from the Monterrazas Prime house-and-lot project, but he is **not a major shareholder** in 8990 Holdings or Mont Property Group.

# The Broader Context

**Pattern of Warnings Ignored:**

The Monterrazas controversy reveals a disturbing pattern:

1. **2008:** Mayor Osmeña revokes permit due to flooding—developer builds retention ponds
2. **2009:** Permit reinstated with conditions for regular inspections—**inspections never happen**
3. **2011:** Mayor Rama issues another cease-and-desist order for flooding—work eventually resumes
4. **2018:** Architect Toti Villalon dies; family appears to lose control of the project​
5. **2019:** 8990 Holdings acquires Genvi for ₱2.337 billion—profit motive intensifies​
6. **2023:** Environmental advocates like Jesus Falcis raise concerns publicly—**concerns dismissed**
7. **2025:** Typhoon Tino causes catastrophic flooding—**153+ deaths nationwide, 108+ in Cebu alone**

**Similar Issues at 8990 Developments:**

Reddit users noted that **Urban Deca Homes**, another 8990 Holdings development in Talisay, Cebu, also experienced severe flooding. This raises questions about the company's overall approach to drainage and flood management across their properties.​

**Corporate Accountability:**

The controversy highlights a troubling dynamic: the actual corporate owners and executives—Luis Yu Jr., Mariano Martinez Jr., and Anthony Vincent Sotto—**have not issued public statements** or faced public scrutiny proportional to their control and profit from the project. Instead, Slater Young, the visible ""brand ambassador,"" has absorbed nearly all the public anger.​

**Local Government Accountability:**

The controversy also highlights failures at the local government level:

* **No regular inspections** despite permit conditions​
* City planning officers admitted they only checked detention ponds once​
* Questions about why permits were repeatedly reinstated despite recurring flooding problems
* Allegations of corruption in flood-control project implementation

# Current Status and What's Next

**Potential Sanctions:**

If violations are confirmed, the DENR warned it will **""not hesitate to enforce corrective actions, including suspension, penalties, or other legal remedies as provided by law""**.​

**Broader Land-Use Planning Issues:**

DENR Undersecretary **Carlos Primo David** stated that the Monterrazas controversy **""involves land-use planning""** and should have been addressed earlier by local government units. He emphasized that there are areas that **""are naturally going to be flooded when extreme events happen""** and that development in such areas must be carefully regulated.​

**Public Demand for Accountability:**

The disaster has sparked widespread calls for:

* Full transparency of engineering studies and geohazard assessments
* Investigation of all officials who approved the project
* Stricter enforcement of environmental regulations
* **Accountability from 8990 Holdings executives Luis Yu Jr., Mariano Martinez Jr., and Anthony Vincent Sotto—not just Slater Young**
* Criminal prosecution if negligence or corruption is proven

# Conclusion

The Monterrazas controversy is not just about one development project—it's about a **systemic failure** of environmental governance, regulatory oversight, and corporate accountability. For nearly two decades, warning signs were ignored, regulations were skirted, and profit was prioritized over public safety.

The project changed hands from **heritage-focused Cebuano developers (Villalon family)** to **profit-driven mass housing moguls (Martinez-Yu empire)**, with a **celebrity engineer (Slater Young)** serving as the public face. Meanwhile, the actual owners—**billionaires Luis Yu Jr. and Mariano Martinez Jr.**—have remained silent while their brand ambassador absorbs public anger.

Now, as Cebu mourns its dead and surveys the destruction, the question remains: **Will this finally be the wake-up call that forces meaningful change, or will it be another disaster forgotten once the floodwaters recede?**

The investigation results will be crucial. But beyond bureaucratic findings, this tragedy demands **justice for the victims**, **accountability from corporate executives**, and a fundamental rethinking of how we balance development with environmental protection in the Philippines.

Set in the sprawling, neon-soaked metropolis of Crown City, the series follows Barnaby Dixon, a 24-year-old radio host turned reluctant hero groomed by the corporate superpower Vale Systems. In this world, heroism isn’t about justice it’s about profit, propaganda, and control. Every “protector” is a trademarked property, every rescue a press event, every corpse a PR opportunity. Barnaby’s mentor, Dr. Miriam Calden, runs Vale’s private hero division with the precision of a surgeon and the ruthlessness of a prophet. Her heroes are engineered, trained, and owned public idols who are privately broken. For years, Barnaby has believed in her cause, convinced the chaos outside Vale’s walls justifies her methods. Until his first mission ends in disaster: the death of a man named Dr. Arthur Greenwell, once a hero himself and now declared “rogue.” Barnaby knows who the man is and hesitates. When another Vale enforcer, Flexion, intervenes and kills Arthur, the Company spins it into a spectacle. The public story crowns Barnaby a hero. But privately, he’s left haunted, questioning whether he saved anyone at all. What begins as guilt spirals into revelation when Barnaby unknowingly meets Nate Greenwell, Arthur’s estranged son, at a coffee shop. Their instant, fragile connection warm, romantic, and human will ultimately destroy them both. As Barnaby tries to reclaim his autonomy from Calden’s control, Nate begins uncovering the truth behind Vale’s corruption. When he learns that Barnaby was involved in his father’s death, the world of “light” both men believed in will collapse. City of Light uses the spectacle of heroism to explore the psychology of control. Powers exist, but they’re rare and unreliable miracles wrapped in trauma. Every ability has a price; every act of heroism leaves scars. Beneath the high-octane action, the series is a character-driven study of guilt, loyalty, and identity in a system that turns people into property. Tonally, the show combines the emotional realism and violence. It’s as much about intimacy and moral decay as it is about superpowers exploring the fragility of people who still believe they can be good in a world that monetizes everything, even redemption.

***

**Ditch the 9-to-5, Embrace the Glow Up: 40+ and FINALLY focusing on ME! ✨ (Say Goodbye to Burnout!)**

Remember those days when “me time” meant a rushed shower and maybe, *maybe*, finishing a cup of coffee while it was still hot? Yeah, me too. But guess what? Those days are OVER.

For years, we've been hustling, juggling, and basically superhuman-ing our way through life. Building careers, raising families, keeping all the plates spinning... and let’s be honest, often ending up feeling like a shattered plate ourselves.

But hello, fabulous forties (and beyond!). It's time for a re-evaluation. A recalibration. A *glow up* of epic proportions. I walked out that 9-to-5 life, and haven't looked back! What’s stopping you?

So, how do we ditch the burnout and dial up the brilliance? Here are a few nuggets of wisdom I’ve picked up on my journey:

*   **Unleash the ""NO!"" Power:** Seriously. It's magical. Say no to things that drain you. Say no to obligations you dread. Say no to guilt trips. (Unless it's from your adorable grandkids…then, maybe compromise a little.)

*   **Reclaim Your Time (and Your Sanity):** What did you used to love doing before “adulting” took over? Painting? Dancing? Stargazing? Dust off those passions! Time is your most precious commodity now; spend it wisely.

*   **Invest in YOU (Yes, Really!):** Remember that hobby you always wanted to try? The course that sparked your curiosity? The weekend getaway you kept putting off? Now's the time. You're not being selfish; you're *investing* in the best version of yourself.

*   **Financial Freedom: A Game Changer:** Seriously, this is HUGE. Feeling financially secure takes a load off your mind and lets you focus on… well, *you*. You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement. [https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb](https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb)

*   **Embrace the Imperfect:** We’ve spent so long striving for perfection, let's let that go! I've learned that authentic is way more rewarding than perfect. Embrace the wrinkles, the grey hairs, the wobbly bits... they're all part of your amazing story.

*   **Surround Yourself with Your Tribe:** Find your people. The ones who lift you up, celebrate your wins, and give you a shoulder to lean on when things get tough. Life's too short for toxic relationships.

Isn’t it time to rediscover what *really* makes you tick? To chase those dreams that got buried under layers of responsibility? To finally put *yourself* first? I think so.

Because honestly, what’s the alternative? More burnout? More feeling unfulfilled? Nah. We’re too fabulous for that.

Someone who is not afraid of exploring life with me, of growing with me, of creating a slow and meaningful life with me. 

About me: 
I'm an introverted homebody with extroverted skills. I have a bachelor's degree and previously worked as a writer and editor. I'm currently contemplating returning to school to pursue a master's. 

I have been told that I'm kind, thoughtful, and smart. I know I feel things deeply. I have chronic depression and ADHD, both of which I am in treatment for. I chafe at my current life, because I think all I have done so far is survive, and I want more than that.

I am easily distracted by dogs, good coffee, and books. I like exploring where I live, visiting farmers' markets and thrift stores, going on hikes, listening to music, trying to keep my plants alive, and collecting art supplies for numerous unfinished projects. 

I'm looking for someone who, when I am with them, I feel safe. I can drop my mask and be me — passionate and goofy and soft and nerdy and sometimes sad. I want someone who will sit with me and hold my hand in both the light and the dark. Is that you?

1os8rir,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/1os8rir/confession_i_have_a_food_addiction_that_is/,Confession: I have a food addiction that is ruining my life,"Okay so I’ve always struggled with food, I grew up chubby, eating unhealthy food and lots of it. Sugar is one of my main addictions, honestly if I could stop eating sugar I think that I would be completely fine and be able to end this. BUT that’s the problem…. I don’t even know where to begin all of this as there’s so much to it. But here goes..

In 2017 I was at my biggest, about 220lbs but it was all fat, I had no exercise growing up, no sports, nothing. I just ate and ate and ate, I was 19 at the time, I became determined to lose weight later that year, so I started working out and eating better. I ended up losing a significant amount of weight and fell in love with the gym and training. 
I have never stopped training, maybe just sometimes not as consistent like I would miss workouts here and there, but I’ve been in the gym training since I started in 2017. 
I got down to 147lbs at one point (2022) which was the lowest I’ve ever gone down to.

Here’s where the food addiction comes in, I am in a relationship and have been since 2020. He doesn’t know about the food addiction and how I secretly eat food and hide it. And I do not ever plan on telling him or anyone I know, I am so embarrassed. We are both super into health and the gym and we eat extremely healthy at home. But secretly I order food when he’s not home, typically coffees with sugar, and sweets, sometimes actual food too. Just a mix of things. I’ve always done it lowkey since we’ve been together but I found I was way more better or strict and would only have little things and be more portioned controlled. But since 2023 I started eating more and more, and of course hiding it and acting like I didn’t eat at all so I’d eat at home on top of what I was eating outside. Since then I gained all my weight back, I’m at like 220lbs again. But of course this is mix with muscle and fat because I still been training in gym. Still I have gained a significant amount of fat. I hate this so much I don’t know what to do, I keep telling myself “tomorrow I’ll stop or this is my last time having this and I’m completely cutting it off and never having this again” then I keep doing it. I look back at my old pictures and see how good I looked and I’m just angry. This post is all over the place and I don’t even know where I’m going with it. I just want to stop, especially the sugar or refined carbs which send me over the edge. And like I know what to do??? Like don’t eat it? I know that the food is so bad for me to yet I still keep eating? Is there an end to this? It’s been going on for 2 years I don’t want this to be my life ",2,1762658641.0,FoodAddiction,2,1.0,False
1os8qer,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1os8qer/my_notes_on_rwby_volume_2/,My Notes on RWBY Volume 2,"So far, I think this a drastic improvement in nearly all regards, the writing has shaped up just as much as Komi-san Season's 2 drastic increase in quality so I'm considering a solic 7/10 for this season and possibly even a 7-8/10, idk I'll argue what I rate it in the actual review, but anyways.

* Best Day ever
* “Dust till Dawn” as a shop name is a bit too cute for a shop like this 
* Mercury and Emerald in an SAO ass outfit debut
* Sorry but that outfit is like directly out of SAO
* God I only have the lamest jokes to tell
* Was that fucking moist critical
* No it was not
* “Third Crusade” isn’t in stock
* Busting Tukson’s balls like this is a dickhead move-
* Oh, they’re here for the white fang I guess 
* Is that fucking Virgil in the notebook?
* “I am not a crook” \*ages 90 years instantly\* Holy fuck that joke dates this so much, even though I’m too young to get the reference
* And I still feel old 
* Weiss is accidentally creampied
* DanTDM ass nigga here
* And the facial animation and whatnot looks much better this season
* Unfortunately I said that as the food fight scene began 
* And this series is known and beloved for its fights scenes 
* So the timing hurts my point 
* All the props and whatnot do look pretty fake 
* The soda clans exploding also looks pretty rough
* Ruby’s flying raijin ass counter attack is cool as fuck dog
* Holy shit, Glynda should get into catering a wedding or something
* “They’re supposed to be defenders of the world”, “but right now they’re still children” 
* This sort of dialogue is better when given to better, more charming, endearing characters 
* Think Dumbledore and what’s her fuck, Kakashi and Iruka, Picollo and Roshi(bit of a stretch)
* “Don’t think, obey”
* The thief guy’s name is Roman
* “Proceeding to phase 2, what like RWBY Volume 2?!”
* Welcome to Beacon
* Ironwood, headmaster of another school makes his debut
* Crow is sort of like a Kakashi/Jiraiya fusion considering his relation to the main character(s)
* And how he is relating crucial, plot relevant, but mysterious information to the head honchos
* I also need Yang to be 18 if she has such opulent jiggle physics 
* I’m not writing all of the notes on how this fucking game works dawg
* “Shut up, don’t touch me” while actively hugging her is cute/funny
* Can’t lie the over dramatic gag or whatever is a bit…meh
* Also their crying looks straight up bad holy crap dawg…
* Dantdm as nigga is named Neptune
* But you can be your sweet bippy, I’m going to exclusively call him DanTDM for the entire fucking series
* In my notes at least
* Blake is fairly cold and dismissive
* “Women” from Nora was quite funny 
* Blake had a conversation with Ozpin under similar circumstances as Ruby
* Supposedly after the events of the season finale last time
* Entrance exam exists
* Ozpin questions why Blake would wear her bow
* And she’s skeptical of how humans would accept Faunus
* Which Ozpin acknowledges and accepts
* But she wants to be judged for who she is 
* Blake is being a real Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 
* Right now
* She wants them to go after their enemies and whatnot, but ehhhh…
* In Harry Potter that was a bit more compelling because, even if it was a bad plan and risky means to track Voldemort, Harry, if I remember correctly, kind of sort of had his connection to Voldemort
* Also Harry was at a point in his character arc where he was a lot more guilty, frustrated, and angry
* That character always had those traits, but the events of the books embolden him and drive him into even darker places
* And by the end of the book Sirius dies as a result 
* It’s a massive, weaving tragedy
* It’s hard to put your protagonist and main characters in the same sort of story beat
* If their characterization and motivation to do so is strong enough
* We need to know RWBY better
* We need to know Blake specifically better
* Why does she think she/they need to solve this instead of telling Ozpin what they know 
* Again in other series they go to great lengths to get into this
* 5 whole books plus majority of a 6th to earn Sirius’ death and display how Harry caused it
* Nearly two hours of screentime(approximate length of season 1), not all of which Blake is actually in let alone talking, is not enough to develop these characters to this point
* Not that I’m entirely in love with the slice of life either
* Saiki L, Mob Pyscho 100, and JJBA especially Part 4 have done it leagues better 
* In a good, properly set up story, when this sort of moment happens, it hypes up the audience 
* Think Walk to Arlong Park and similar narrative moments to that
* I’m not being an asshole for asshole’s sake, the story just hasn’t gripped or compelled me to care much
* For that matter, Mercury and Emerald made their debut last episode
* I am physically incapable of caring that they’re here hiding as students or whatever now
* Even if their boss has been around for longer, I don’t even know the woman’s name
* Again again again, in a better series this moment works a lot better
* Think Book 7 of Harry Potter where Snape becomes headmaster 
* The hype and stakes of such circumstances is earned over the course of 6 books
* A minor Hiccup
* Spruce Willis
* Jaune tries asking Weiss out
* All of their new casual outfits are very cute and good 
* Sun and Neptune join the gang
* Weiss wanted to go with Neptune apparently
* Penny is back
* She finna make me stack
* Donuts on my-sorry I got bored
* Ruby goes after a seemingly confused Penny
* But she was just pretending
* Oh scrolls are straight up phones 
* Man am I dumb
* Weiss does not want to be patched through to her father
* Even after obtaining her information
* Alesian knight 200 make their debut 
* Alesian paladin are battle suits
* Also the robots or whatever seem to make Penny uncomfortable and she runs away
* While Soldiers chase after them
* Penny saves Ruby from a truck much to Ruby’s shock
* It didn’t seem to be aura either
* Man I’m a sucker for robot girls
* That’s the only reason I fuck with this for real
* Otherwise uhhh, very obvious
* No shit she’s a robot
* Paint the Town…
* Penny is the first synthetic person capable of generating aura
* And she claims she’s not real
* While Ruby rejects that and argues that Penny is real
* Apparently, Ironwood helped to make Penny
* Also Penny decides to go with the soldier 
* Epilepsy warning, Jesus Christ
* Yang makes an explosive entrance/return into the club
* “What a woman” she fucking better be with these jiggle physics and if she’s getting a drink
* Fuck nigga, tryna get me in trouble
* The White fang wear grim masks as a form of symbolism to represent how humans wanted to paint them as monsters 
* So they’re running off of anti-bourgeois sentiment 
* They’ve also stolen and repurposed an Aleian paladin
* God Torchwick sucks as a name and thing to say, I’m calling him Roman
* Roman recognizes Sun and Blake
* Who then retreat from the paladin
* God the paladin has way too many polygons dawg
* It looks so bad
* Neptune’s weapon looks pretty dope 
* And Sun can create clones
* Freeze burn is legitimately a cool tactile move dawg 
* With each hit Yang gets stronger
* Paladin is destroyed 
* Neopolitan makes her wordless debut 
* I like seeing how much the girls’ training has paid off
* I fuck with seeing teamwork and synergy paid off like this
* They managed to make both Paladin and the girls feel legitimately powerful
* Extracurricular starts with a fight scene
* And I might have to steal some of these weapons
* I already stole Crescent rose for a character, but I’m sure I could steal something else
* Pyrrha really packed up a fucking 2 v 1, or was that a 1 v 1?
* Mercury wants to fight Pyrrha for some reason 
* I like kick boys, so I fuck with Mercury for real
* At least a little 
* Sun asks Blake out to the dance who is very dismissive about it
* Is it just me or is Ruby’s hair sometimes more red?
* Blake apparently is starting to eat less and overall do worse
* Yang and Weiss are planning the whole dance 
* Seeing that Blake is willing to work herself ragged is a compelling argument for how dedicated she is to going after the bad guys 
* Jaune shows up and asks Weiss to the dance
* Ruby is sad about the fact that Blake won’t go
* We see Jaune training with Pyrrha
* Jaune apparently hasn’t discovered his semblance yet
* They relay the Pyrrha information to their boss
* Who has her added to a list
* Also they’re confident she can beat Pyrrha
* See this is the kind of hype I was talking about
* Burning the candles
* Ruby reiterates that Blake not going means the dance is pointless
* Someone uses a laser pointer to start fucking with Blake 
* Apparently it was Yang
* Also how did she-
* “And I you”
* Poor nigga just wants to get dressed 
* This is pretty typical romance dialogue from Jaune and the stuff he says about Weiss, it’s very sweet and sincere though
* I like that
* Pyrrha then gives him very good advice
* And Nora tells her to practice what she preaches 
* Ruby and Blake grew up on patch
* Summer Rose was a huntress who went on a mission one day and dissapeared 
* Summer Rose wasn’t the first love bro had she was the second
* Summer, Yang’z mom, Crow, and their dad were all once in a team together 
* Yang was super curious about her mother since no one told her why she left her with her dad
* I actually do like the almost story board, fantasy creature quality presentation of Yang’s story 
* And I actually do think it is a good answer to Blake’s plight and is relevant to her 
* In a lot of these situations I feel like it’s either too one to one, or too far a part
* Yang and Ruby almost got killed by Grim, but Crow came in to save them
* Blake retorts that she isn’t a child
* While Yang observes she isn’t telling her to stop
* Yang hugs Blake and begs her to rest
* It’s baity…
* But this is legit good chemistry and a well written dynamic between these two
* Jaune walks in on Weiss asking out Neptune
* Which I can’t imagine why she likes him man’s I don’t believe an explanation is given 
* I think Ozpin’s speech towards Ruby is fairly good, I’m starting to like him a bit more
* I also just realized bro is Oz…as in the great and powerful Oz…
* Peter Port was the name of the boar teacher from before
* Dance Dance Infiltration
* Weiss and Neptune went alone I guess, separately
* To Jaune’s apparent anger
* Good man Jaune, going to check on Pyrrha first
* “Everyone assumes I’m too good for them” Komi-San ass complex
* Also her reason for liking Jaune is also straight out of Komi-San 
* Neptune can’t dance and that’s why he didn’t ask Weiss out
* Jaune, a real niggs gives Neptune the same advice Pyrrha gave him and then some
* That’s what I like nigga
* The writing and slice of life has increased in quality considerably
* Penny is at the dance too
* Also I’m not sure RWBY earned “the big dance everyone needs as a break from their stress of the school year”
* In Harry Potter that was much more earned considering how difficult Hogwarts and specifically these years with Harry we see
* Here sure we see that they’ve improved a lot, but it’s still not like their training has shown to be too difficult
* The only one who’s really had a rough time of it seems to be Blake for real
* Everyone else’s problems in comparison are tiny for real
* Jaune re-arrives back at the dance, this time in a dress much to everyone’s amusement 
* The dance choreography is pretty good too
* Of course Jaune is a nigga with 7 sisters
* JAUNE IS A REAL ASS NIGGA
* I FUCK WITH THE JAUNE AGENDA FOR REAL
* Mercury informs his boss that everyone has a partner
* Forgetting Ruby
* We see his boss sneak around-
* Hello booty
* What was I saying 
* Something stupid probably 
* Pound symbol? You guys are terrible at your jobs, use a fucking £€& or something more unique 
* Ruby follows what her fuck, we still don’t know her name before briefly encountering her in battle
* For whom the bell tolls are ending
* Ozpin interrogated Ruby
* Who informs them she’s much like the girl from the first episode
* Which of course, she is
* She also drops the information that the South east is endanger 
* A dog comes in through the mail
* And man that model looks pretty rough
* Oh yeah of course Blake wouldn’t like the dog 
* The dogs name is…I couldn’t fucking catch it dog, fucking something Chinese
* The destruction of art and whatnot lead to kids being named after colors, which is held to this day
* Ozpin assigns team RWBY to the south east so they won’t break the rules and get themselves into even more trouble
* He also warns/teaches them that the hunter will be in charge 
* Team Coffee returns
* Velvett debuted a while ago
* But now we know her name, as a rabbit girl
* She has a nice cute voice 
* Search and Destroy
* Doctor Oobleck makes his debut, he looks like the same nigga as before
* “Those are truffles”
* “Those are Brussels”
* You’re lucky I’m a bojack horseman fan, otherwise I’d find the penchant for the rhyming to be quite unfortunate timing, lining the script with too many kidding jokes and thus declining the quality of the script, leaving me much maligning the writer for their writing.
* One of the kingdom’s greatest failures
* Mountain Glenn, which was attempted as an expansion of vale
* But became overrun with Grimm 
* Ruby brought her dog with them, making her genius 
* Zwei is the dog’s name
* Grimm are attracted towards all negativity, so like emotional stuff
* The pack of Grimm see and encounter the girls
* Leading to them dispatching them
* Oobleck questions why Yang wants to be a huntress
* And first she explains what a huntress is
* Before Yang explains that she’s an adventurer and adrenaline junkies who wants to have many adventures
* Meanwhile Weiss sees it as her duty to be a huntress because of her capability to fight
* Blake believes there’s too much wrong in this world to stand by and do nothing
* But she doesn’t know how even though Oobleck asks her
* Oobleck and Ruby secure the perimeter 
* Spotting Goliath Grimm who have lived hundreds of years
* Grimm who do not kill or engage with humans the same way that other Grimm because of the consequences 
* Oobleck is a huntsman and teacher because he believes his mind and knowledge can save more people than a traditional weapon 
* There’s nothing else he’d rather be
* Mountain Glenn
* Glynda tries to convince Ironwood to trust Ozpin
* Weiss is aware that how her father operated the company is less than entirely moral 
* She believed being a huntress will allow her to tackle that
* Blake had a mentor named Adam
* But she found out his ideals weren’t best for everyone 
* Blake believes that all she does in the face of hardship is run away
* And she points out how she ran from the white fang and the reveal of her being a Faunus 
* Even her semblance leaves behind a shadow clone to take hits
* Yang reaffirms she just wants to be an adventurer and is more than content with going with the flow
* Unlike Ruby whose previous motivation is also reaffirmed
* Yang says that they’re not kids anymore now that they’re basically soldiers out here 
* Ruby and Zwei encounter the white fang 
* Then Ruby falls underground without her weapon
* A bit of a contrivance but I like this sort of thing
* Ruby is smacked and kicked out
* In their final attempt at survival the citizens of Glenn fled into the below caves 
* Which is now the world’s largest tomb since eventually underground grim made their way in
* No Brakes
* Ruby runs away as her team comes to retrieve her
* And Roman plans to start the train and run away
* The train cars are full of weapons and shit
* The train cars all have bombs and keep on decoupling themselves as it’s very clear they’re not wanted
* The explosions lead to Grimm coming in
* Roman’s plan is revealed to be leading Grimm into the city
* Dog bazooka
* Blake has head on Neopolitan and she’s nearly 100% more wide to boot
* Weiss handles your man Texas chainsaw massacre ass nigga
* And Blake gets to fight Roman
* “SHE’S 17 YOU SICK FUCK!!!”
* He is handily beaten and put on the ground
* Yo did bro just use a Roman command on her and grab her even though she was plus on her attack!?
* Blake kicks Roman unconscious before running away with an unconscious Weiss
* New bitch comes in with an Akame ga kill ass, Raiden high frequency katana fusion
* Causing Neopolitaan to flee
* And new butch leaves the scene subsequently, as Yang barely catches a glimpse
* There’s a lot of going on a head here 
* Weiss was not unconscious sorry 
* The Grimm make it into the city
* AHHHHHHHH REAL WOMAN JUMPSCARE
* Breach
* Jaune gets an unexpected call from Ruby
* And gets a bad feeling
* Then they hear sirens and decide to go help team RWBY
* Ruby gets a matrix reference
* Jaune’s team comes in 
* Jaune handily dispatches an ursa
* Sun and Neptune are here too
* As are Ironwood’s army and jet dudes
* Emerald and Mercury join the fray
* As does team Coffee
* I’m not writing out their initial 
* Fuck yky
* There are already way too many notes to keep track off because all of the niggas fighting 
* “You just destroyed my favorite clothing store” \*becomes “woke” instantly\* 
* Kill me
* She did not spend all of semester building her weapon up
* I didn’t fucking know she had a name until like three or four episodes ago

1os8pgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuttingWeight/comments/1os8pgs/please_help_cant_lose_weight_been_trying_over_a/,"Please help, can’t lose weight, been trying over a year 😢😢😢","I really need help on what has been proven for effective and safe weight loss after kids and while nursing (and as fast as possible without being at all harmful).

I’m 42 with two kids about two years apart. My whole life I’ve been about 135 pounds (5’7’’) and a size 6 / medium and now I’m 200lb / an extra large /I believe size 10+. 

My facial features are like hidden from the fat, I have a thick neck, fat fingers, thick arms and bat wings, no hour glass shape to speak of—more like an apple, a belly with an overhang like I’m still pregnant (belly fat is the unhealthiest area to have fat), thighs that stick together, a lumpy butt and thighs, a hump on the back of my neck like I’m the hunchback of notre dame…I went from what men I dated (mostly fit and handsome marathon runners, boxers, and soccer players) called hot to totally obesely hideous. 

I have tried pretty hard to lose weight, but after one year having my kid, I’ve only lost 2 pounds (baseline being 10 days after delivering! A time where I was making no effort, was in bed and on the couch nonstop, eating ice cream and serotonin producing not-great foods and lots of eating out).

Since then I’ve switched to home cooked meals, kale omelette nearly every breakfast, salads nearly every lunch, balanced meals every night (for example, tonight was brown rice with meatballs and zucchini), lighter and less calorie heavy snacking, before lunches and dinners often having a powder that is high fiber, high protein, high superfoods, has a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, probiotics, and some essential fatty acids in about 10 ounces of water to help me feel full before my meals and increase my general health and energy. 

I usually drink about 60 ounces of filtered water every day. I have usually one or two lattes with stevia and once in a while I’ll treat myself to a mocha without whipped cream and some cookies and pizza 1-2 times per week and a little organic red wine a few nights a week (4.5 ounces per day max) to prevent feelings of deprivation / giving up entirely.

I’ve tried different supplements, but they make little to no difference and there’s very little I can safely take while breast-feeding so I’ve given up on them, only the powder I mentioned above. They’re also loaded with heavy metals most of them, including the postnatal multivitamin I was taking (I can’t find one that has a clean test report…have you?).

I don’t count calories because those apps have never made it easy so I feel like I’m getting widely inaccurate numbers, and regardless —I’m eating pretty much the exact same as I did when I was 135lb, maybe a little more because breast-feeding has left me more hungry, but not insane amounts. Lowering calories right now lowers milk production so it’s not a good time either.

I am doing “baby-led weaning” so I’m only now feeding roughly every four hours but at night anytime my one-year-old wakes up he wants to feed on me to go back to bed. I think more than anything, it’s the disrupted sleep that has led to the hormones going crazy and just leaving me depleted, hungry, moody, unhappy, stressed, striving for energy and mental clarity constantly, and just in a constant state of disarray.

I’m almost certain I’m suffering from stuff like high cortisol. I’ve never been good at reducing my stress and I really suck at meditation (thus, kind of hate it).

I don’t want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars out of pocket with these crazy high deductible plans just to get a couple of blood tests to check things out because anytime I’ve done that in the past, my results always came out clean/totally normal… and I did all the multiple thyroid, hypothyroid tests, all of that. And what if something is off, they’re just going to prescribe medication that I can’t safely take while nursing anyway, so frankly, I don’t see the point.

I have 65 pounds to lose and at the rate of 2 pounds per year, we’re talking 33 freaking years to get back to my normal weight when I see so many other moms (I’m not talking celebrities with trainers but every day women in my direct local circle) that got their bodies back within a couple of months. Some got them back like literally right after the baby came out. It’s baffling to me how someone dealing with all these hormones can be a twig with a round belly. Anyway, I can’t wait decades, this must go faster! Anytime it goes so slow I get so discouraged that I wanna quit and then I start slipping a little with sugar.

My body seems to want to hold onto every ounce of weight/fat during nursing or something. But I believe in “attachment parenting” and can’t ever imagine cutting off my kid and that special bonding for something as superficial as weight. But I also know at this weight it’s much more serious than just appearance.

My extra weight has led to back pain, pelvic pain, foot and knee pain, shoulder pain, not wanting to be seen in public or by my own husband, etc. 
I try to walk, but my injuries and aches only allow me to do so much. I’ve had a hip injury that’s been extremely stubborn and hasn’t gone away for almost 10 years now. Pretty much the only solution seems to be surgery, which I refuse to do at such a young age, it just causes so many problems, so long story short, I can’t do high impact stuff. I get really bored with gyms and stuff so for me, I need something like sports and it’s hard to find one that is not high impact. Especially when you’re competitive. Swimming is one but that’s one that makes you hungrier due to the temperature drop (that’s why walruses, whales, and other sea animals are thicker than animals like cheetahs and horses).

I fight sugar and caffeine cravings a lot, sometimes even nicotine. In the past, I relied on caffeine a lot for an energy and mood lift and sort of an appetite suppressant. Same with v@ping and supplements to help with sugar cravings and appetite control and metabolism boosts. I also detoxed a lot to help get rid of sugar cravings (stuff like coffee enemas and infrared sauna sessions) and I did a combination of water-only fasting and intermittent fasting, and I restricted carbs but I can’t do any of that while nursing. And I wonder, was it restricting carbs that has slowed down my metabolism? Is it bad to do that long-term?

And then there is the emotional element of eating which I am leaning more on because I’m often frustrated a lot from the lack of freedom and how hard it is to take care of two young kids, and ever since pregnancy started, but especially after, it has really taken a toll on my relationship with my husband. I’m just often very angry and on edge and moody, and feel lack of emotional support which makes me feel a void and resentful toward my husband. Having kids has also increased my anxiety, which has made me more controlling, striving for a sense of order, especially so my kids get enough rest, are developed well, etc.

And I also like a lot of flavor in my foods, I was raised in a culture that uses a lot of olive oil and a lot of salt and a lot of seasoning and to have bland food feels like a sort of joyless prison.

And every psychologist/ therapist I have ever seen has just utterly failed me, I find it such a waste of time, never any results. I don’t need anyone to talk to, I just need someone who can change negative thoughts and habits and after seeing maybe a dozen therapists over the years, it’s just impossible to find someone who can actually make a noticeable difference. I even tried hypnotherapy and trauma therapy (was abused as a kid) but nope, I’m in the same boat. I feel like all they do is drain your bank account and your time.

Anyway, if any of you have faced a similar situation or have suggestions on what may work in my circumstances, is proven safe during nursing, etc. please share.

1os8p1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyWeightLoss/comments/1os8p1r/please_help_cant_lose_weight_been_trying_over_a/,"Please help, can’t lose weight, been trying over a year 😢😢😢","I really need help on what has been proven for effective and safe weight loss after kids and while nursing (and as fast as possible without being at all harmful).

I’m 42 with two kids about two years apart. My whole life I’ve been about 135 pounds (5’7’’) and a size 6 / medium and now I’m 200lb / an extra large /I believe size 10+. 

My facial features are like hidden from the fat, I have a thick neck, fat fingers, thick arms and bat wings, no hour glass shape to speak of—more like an apple, a belly with an overhang like I’m still pregnant (belly fat is the unhealthiest area to have fat), thighs that stick together, a lumpy butt and thighs, a hump on the back of my neck like I’m the hunchback of notre dame…I went from what men I dated (mostly fit and handsome marathon runners, boxers, and soccer players) called hot to totally obesely hideous. 

I have tried pretty hard to lose weight, but after one year having my kid, I’ve only lost 2 pounds (baseline being 10 days after delivering! A time where I was making no effort, was in bed and on the couch nonstop, eating ice cream and serotonin producing not-great foods and lots of eating out).

Since then I’ve switched to home cooked meals, kale omelette nearly every breakfast, salads nearly every lunch, balanced meals every night (for example, tonight was brown rice with meatballs and zucchini), lighter and less calorie heavy snacking, before lunches and dinners often having a powder that is high fiber, high protein, high superfoods, has a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, probiotics, and some essential fatty acids in about 10 ounces of water to help me feel full before my meals and increase my general health and energy. 

I usually drink about 60 ounces of filtered water every day. I have usually one or two lattes with stevia and once in a while I’ll treat myself to a mocha without whipped cream and some cookies and pizza 1-2 times per week and a little organic red wine a few nights a week (4.5 ounces per day max) to prevent feelings of deprivation / giving up entirely.

I’ve tried different supplements, but they make little to no difference and there’s very little I can safely take while breast-feeding so I’ve given up on them, only the powder I mentioned above. They’re also loaded with heavy metals most of them, including the postnatal multivitamin I was taking (I can’t find one that has a clean test report…have you?).

I don’t count calories because those apps have never made it easy so I feel like I’m getting widely inaccurate numbers, and regardless —I’m eating pretty much the exact same as I did when I was 135lb, maybe a little more because breast-feeding has left me more hungry, but not insane amounts. Lowering calories right now lowers milk production so it’s not a good time either.

I am doing “baby-led weaning” so I’m only now feeding roughly every four hours but at night anytime my one-year-old wakes up he wants to feed on me to go back to bed. I think more than anything, it’s the disrupted sleep that has led to the hormones going crazy and just leaving me depleted, hungry, moody, unhappy, stressed, striving for energy and mental clarity constantly, and just in a constant state of disarray.

I’m almost certain I’m suffering from stuff like high cortisol. I’ve never been good at reducing my stress and I really suck at meditation (thus, kind of hate it).

I don’t want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars out of pocket with these crazy high deductible plans just to get a couple of blood tests to check things out because anytime I’ve done that in the past, my results always came out clean/totally normal… and I did all the multiple thyroid, hypothyroid tests, all of that. And what if something is off, they’re just going to prescribe medication that I can’t safely take while nursing anyway, so frankly, I don’t see the point.

I have 65 pounds to lose and at the rate of 2 pounds per year, we’re talking 33 freaking years to get back to my normal weight when I see so many other moms (I’m not talking celebrities with trainers but every day women in my direct local circle) that got their bodies back within a couple of months. Some got them back like literally right after the baby came out. It’s baffling to me how someone dealing with all these hormones can be a twig with a round belly. Anyway, I can’t wait decades, this must go faster! Anytime it goes so slow I get so discouraged that I wanna quit and then I start slipping a little with sugar.

My body seems to want to hold onto every ounce of weight/fat during nursing or something. But I believe in “attachment parenting” and can’t ever imagine cutting off my kid and that special bonding for something as superficial as weight. But I also know at this weight it’s much more serious than just appearance.

My extra weight has led to back pain, pelvic pain, foot and knee pain, shoulder pain, not wanting to be seen in public or by my own husband, etc. 
I try to walk, but my injuries and aches only allow me to do so much. I’ve had a hip injury that’s been extremely stubborn and hasn’t gone away for almost 10 years now. Pretty much the only solution seems to be surgery, which I refuse to do at such a young age, it just causes so many problems, so long story short, I can’t do high impact stuff. I get really bored with gyms and stuff so for me, I need something like sports and it’s hard to find one that is not high impact. Especially when you’re competitive. Swimming is one but that’s one that makes you hungrier due to the temperature drop (that’s why walruses, whales, and other sea animals are thicker than animals like cheetahs and horses).

I fight sugar and caffeine cravings a lot, sometimes even nicotine. In the past, I relied on caffeine a lot for an energy and mood lift and sort of an appetite suppressant. Same with v@ping and supplements to help with sugar cravings and appetite control and metabolism boosts. I also detoxed a lot to help get rid of sugar cravings (stuff like coffee enemas and infrared sauna sessions) and I did a combination of water-only fasting and intermittent fasting, and I restricted carbs but I can’t do any of that while nursing. And I wonder, was it restricting carbs that has slowed down my metabolism? Is it bad to do that long-term?

And then there is the emotional element of eating which I am leaning more on because I’m often frustrated a lot from the lack of freedom and how hard it is to take care of two young kids, and ever since pregnancy started, but especially after, it has really taken a toll on my relationship with my husband. I’m just often very angry and on edge and moody, and feel lack of emotional support which makes me feel a void and resentful toward my husband. Having kids has also increased my anxiety, which has made me more controlling, striving for a sense of order, especially so my kids get enough rest, are developed well, etc.

And I also like a lot of flavor in my foods, I was raised in a culture that uses a lot of olive oil and a lot of salt and a lot of seasoning and to have bland food feels like a sort of joyless prison.

And every psychologist/ therapist I have ever seen has just utterly failed me, I find it such a waste of time, never any results. I don’t need anyone to talk to, I just need someone who can change negative thoughts and habits and after seeing maybe a dozen therapists over the years, it’s just impossible to find someone who can actually make a noticeable difference. I even tried hypnotherapy and trauma therapy (was abused as a kid) but nope, I’m in the same boat. I feel like all they do is drain your bank account and your time.

Anyway, if any of you have faced a similar situation or have suggestions on what may work in my circumstances, is proven safe during nursing, etc. please share.

And what if something is off, they’re just going to prescribe medication that I can’t safely take while nursing anyway, so frankly, I don’t see the point.

I have 65 pounds to lose and at the rate of 2 pounds per year, we’re talking 33 freaking years to get back to my normal weight when I see so many other moms (I’m not talking celebrities with trainers but every day women in my direct local circle) that got their bodies back within a couple of months. Some got them back like literally right after the baby came out. It’s baffling to me how someone dealing with all these hormones can be a twig with a round belly. Anyway, I can’t wait decades, this must go faster! Anytime it goes so slow I get so discouraged that I wanna quit and then I start slipping a little with sugar.

My body seems to want to hold onto every ounce of weight/fat during nursing or something. But I believe in “attachment parenting” and can’t ever imagine cutting off my kid and that special bonding for something as superficial as weight. But I also know at this weight it’s much more serious than just appearance.

My extra weight has led to back pain, pelvic pain, foot and knee pain, shoulder pain, not wanting to be seen in public or by my own husband, etc. 
I try to walk, but my injuries and aches only allow me to do so much. I’ve had a hip injury that’s been extremely stubborn and hasn’t gone away for almost 10 years now. Pretty much the only solution seems to be surgery, which I refuse to do at such a young age, it just causes so many problems, so long story short, I can’t do high impact stuff. I get really bored with gyms and stuff so for me, I need something like sports and it’s hard to find one that is not high impact. Especially when you’re competitive. Swimming is one but that’s one that makes you hungrier due to the temperature drop (that’s why walruses, whales, and other sea animals are thicker than animals like cheetahs and horses).

I fight sugar and caffeine cravings a lot, sometimes even nicotine. In the past, I relied on caffeine a lot for an energy and mood lift and sort of an appetite suppressant. Same with v@ping and supplements to help with sugar cravings and appetite control and metabolism boosts. I also detoxed a lot to help get rid of sugar cravings (stuff like coffee enemas and infrared sauna sessions) and I did a combination of water-only fasting and intermittent fasting, and I restricted carbs but I can’t do any of that while nursing. And I wonder, was it restricting carbs that has slowed down my metabolism? Is it bad to do that long-term?

And then there is the emotional element of eating which I am leaning more on because I’m often frustrated a lot from the lack of freedom and how hard it is to take care of two young kids, and ever since pregnancy started, but especially after, it has really taken a toll on my relationship with my husband. I’m just often very angry and on edge and moody, and feel lack of emotional support which makes me feel a void and resentful toward my husband. Having kids has also increased my anxiety, which has made me more controlling, striving for a sense of order, especially so my kids get enough rest, are developed well, etc.

And I also like a lot of flavor in my foods, I was raised in a culture that uses a lot of olive oil and a lot of salt and a lot of seasoning and to have bland food feels like a sort of joyless prison.

And every psychologist/ therapist I have ever seen has just utterly failed me, I find it such a waste of time, never any results. I don’t need anyone to talk to, I just need someone who can change negative thoughts and habits and after seeing maybe a dozen therapists over the years, it’s just impossible to find someone who can actually make a noticeable difference. I even tried hypnotherapy and trauma therapy (was abused as a kid) but nope, I’m in the same boat. I feel like all they do is drain your bank account and your time.

Anyway, if any of you have faced a similar situation or have suggestions on what may work in my circumstances, is proven safe during nursing, etc. please share.

We chase that dream of a perfectly golden waffle—crisp and ridged on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside—but so often, our modern gadgets let us down.

There's a reason your grandparents made incredible waffles, and it wasn't just a secret recipe. It was the tool. It's time to ditch the flimsy plastic and embrace the heavyweight champion of breakfast: the **cast iron waffle maker**. This isn't just a piece of nostalgia; it's a fundamental kitchen tool that delivers results no electric model can touch.

---

## The Secret is in the Iron

Let's get right to it. The magic of a cast iron waffle maker comes down to one thing: **thermal mass**.

Unlike thin electric plates that heat up and cool down quickly, cast iron is dense. It takes a while to get hot, but once it does, it holds that heat fiercely and distributes it evenly. When you pour your batter onto that scorching, evenly-heated surface, the outside of the waffle sears instantly. This rapid, intense heat is what creates that deep, golden-brown crust through the Maillard reaction—the chemical process that gives browned food its delicious, complex flavor.

The result? A waffle with an **unbeatable crisp exterior** that provides a satisfying crunch, giving way to a perfectly steamed and tender interior. It’s a textural masterpiece that flimsy modern machines just can't replicate.

---

## It’s More Than Just a Waffle Maker

Think of a cast iron waffle maker not as a single-use appliance, but as a stovetop press with endless possibilities. Its versatility is part of what makes it such a valuable addition to your kitchen.

Once you're done with breakfast, try using it for:

- **Paninis and Grilled Cheese:** Get those perfect, crispy, diagonal grill marks on any sandwich.
- **Brownies and Cookies:** Pour your favorite batter in for individual, perfectly portioned treats with crispy edges.
- **Hash Browns:** Press shredded, seasoned potatoes into the grids for ultra-crispy potato cakes.
- **Cinnamon Rolls:** Place unbaked rolls in the iron for a caramelized, gooey, and crisp-bottomed treat.

It’s essentially a portable, stovetop grill that opens up a world of cooking beyond just waffles.

---

## The Learning Curve: Seasoning is Your Best Friend

Okay, let's address the elephant in the room: cast iron requires care. But it's not as intimidating as it sounds. The key is **seasoning**.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=cast%20iron%20waffle%20maker)

Seasoning is the process of baking a thin layer of oil into the iron, which polymerizes and creates a natural, durable non-stick surface. The more you use and care for your waffle maker, the better that seasoning gets.

Here’s the simple process for a new or rusty waffle maker:

1.  **Scrub:** Wash it thoroughly with hot, soapy water and a stiff brush to remove any factory coating or rust. This is the *only* time you'll use soap.
2.  **Dry:** Place it on your stove over low heat until it's completely dry. Any moisture left will cause rust.
3.  **Oil:** Apply a very thin, even layer of a neutral, high-smoke-point oil (like canola, grapeseed, or Crisco) over every surface, inside and out. Use a paper towel to wipe off as much as possible—you want a barely-there sheen, not a pool of oil.
4.  **Bake:** Place it in an oven upside down (to prevent oil pooling) at a high temperature, around 450-500°F (230-260°C), for an hour. Your kitchen will get smoky, so open a window.
5.  **Cool:** Let it cool completely in the oven before storing.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=cast%20iron%20waffle%20maker)

After that, just clean it after each use with a stiff brush and hot water, dry it on the stove, and give it a very light wipe-down with oil before putting it away. That’s it. You’re building a legacy piece of cookware.

---

## Tips for Waffle Perfection

Once your iron is seasoned and ready, here's how to get the best results every time.

- **Preheat Like You Mean It:** This is non-negotiable. Let the waffle maker heat on the burner for a good 10-15 minutes. Test it with a drop of water—if it sizzles and evaporates instantly, it's ready.
- **Oil it Up:** Even a well-seasoned iron benefits from a little fat right before you pour the batter. Use a pastry brush or a paper towel to lightly oil the grids.
- **Don't Overfill:** Less is more. Overfilling leads to a messy overflow that's a pain to clean. The batter will expand.
- **Patience is Key:** Don't be tempted to peek too early. Let it cook for a solid 3-5 minutes before checking. You'll know it's done when the steam stops pouring out of the sides.

> A simple rule of thumb I live by: **When the steam slows down to a trickle, your waffle is ready.**

## A Little Something I Wish I’d Known Sooner

There's one frustration that can turn people off stovetop cooking, especially on modern glass-top or induction stoves: **hot spots**. Getting an even, consistent heat across the entire surface of your cast iron waffle maker can be tricky. You might end up with a waffle that's burnt on one side and underdone on the other.

I fought this battle for a while until I discovered the simplest, most effective solution: a **heat diffuser**.

A heat diffuser is just a flat metal disc (sometimes with holes) that sits between your burner and your pan. It takes the direct, intense heat from the stove and spreads it out gently and evenly across the bottom of the waffle maker. It's not a flashy gadget—it costs less than a bag of good coffee—but it’s the one thing that took my waffles from ""good"" to ""mind-blowingly good."" For anyone serious about stovetop cast iron cooking, it's an absolute must-have.

Embrace the sizzle, care for your iron, and you'll be making the best waffles of your life, one perfectly crisp square at a time.",1,1762658103.0,WaffleNationHQ,0,1.0,False

I’m 42 with two kids about two years apart. My whole life I’ve been about 135 pounds (5’7’’) and a size 6 / medium and now I’m 200lb / an extra large /I believe size 10+. 

My facial features are like hidden from the fat, I have a thick neck, fat fingers, thick arms and bat wings, no hour glass shape to speak of—more like an apple, a belly with an overhang like I’m still pregnant (belly fat is the unhealthiest area to have fat), thighs that stick together, a lumpy butt and thighs, a hump on the back of my neck like I’m the hunchback of notre dame…I went from what men I dated (mostly fit and handsome marathon runners, boxers, and soccer players) called hot to totally obesely hideous. 

I have tried pretty hard to lose weight, but after one year having my kid, I’ve only lost 2 pounds (baseline being 10 days after delivering! A time where I was making no effort, was in bed and on the couch nonstop, eating ice cream and serotonin producing not-great foods and lots of eating out).

Since then I’ve switched to home cooked meals, kale omelette nearly every breakfast, salads nearly every lunch, balanced meals every night (for example, tonight was brown rice with meatballs and zucchini), lighter and less calorie heavy snacking, before lunches and dinners often having a powder that is high fiber, high protein, high superfoods, has a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, probiotics, and some essential fatty acids in about 10 ounces of water to help me feel full before my meals and increase my general health and energy. 

I usually drink about 60 ounces of filtered water every day. I have usually one or two lattes with stevia and once in a while I’ll treat myself to a mocha without whipped cream and some cookies and pizza 1-2 times per week and a little organic red wine a few nights a week (4.5 ounces per day max) to prevent feelings of deprivation / giving up entirely.

I’ve tried different supplements, but they make little to no difference and there’s very little I can safely take while breast-feeding so I’ve given up on them, only the powder I mentioned above. They’re also loaded with heavy metals most of them, including the postnatal multivitamin I was taking (I can’t find one that has a clean test report…have you?).

I don’t count calories because those apps have never made it easy so I feel like I’m getting widely inaccurate numbers, and regardless —I’m eating pretty much the exact same as I did when I was 135lb, maybe a little more because breast-feeding has left me more hungry, but not insane amounts. Lowering calories right now lowers milk production so it’s not a good time either.

I am doing “baby-led weaning” so I’m only now feeding roughly every four hours but at night anytime my one-year-old wakes up he wants to feed on me to go back to bed.

1os8kaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/1os8kaf/help_i_need_to_get_over_him/,HELP I NEED TO GET OVER HIM,"I’m going to start off by saying that I think I’m conventionally attractive. This is important for the story. People constantly tell me how pretty I am, men always stare at me and ask me out, a man has never rejected me before. Yes I have my insecurities and I feel ugly some days but for the most part I’m confident in my looks. 

Anyways, I got out of a very serious relationship about two years ago. I was heart broken and a mess for about two months until I began to heal and move on and get over it. Fast forward like 8 months later, I start studying with this guy I knew for a while. We grew up together but never really talked and we got to know each other more cause we needed to study a lot so we would hang out in the library together. 

He started giving a ton of mixed signals about whether he liked me back. He’d say stuff about how he thinks he’s too busy or young for a relationship (we’re not too young we’re early 20s) or how he isn’t sure where his life is going so he wouldn’t get into a relationship right now but then he’d compliment me all the time and ask me to come to get coffee with him and hug me a second longer than usual or go on long walks with me so we could take a break from studying and he would text me and snap me all the time. 

Now of course he had his red flags. He was a player and I’m pretty sure he’s been with a lot of girls before. He’s kind of hypocritical and lies about small things all the time (like one time he said he would come study cause he was gonna skip class but his friend told me that their class was canceled that day anyways, like why lie about that but he lied about so many small things like that). His masculinity is so fragile and he’s overly aggressive and has anger issues. And on top of that he’s horrible at communicating and is the driest texter. Writing this all out I have no idea why I am so overly obsessed with him. 

Anyways, this back and forth and subtle flirting goes on for months and he starts ghosting me for a few days and then showering me with attention and compliments the next back and forth hot and cold. and one day he makes a joke over text about me going on a date with another man and I lose it. I end up just spilling everything and confronting him about how our relationship has been and asking if he has feelings for me like I do for him. He said he did and that he has noticed I liked him and that’s when he got cold cause he didn’t want to lead me on because he said he’s not ready for a relationship. His texting is so dry and awful though it was hard to have a serious conversation so he said to meet him in person. I go and he gets in my car and then he tells me he never had any idea I liked him and that he likes me but can’t be in a relationship and I said that’s okay cause I’m also busy with school and then he touches my hand and starts STROKING IT WITH HIS THUMB AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST LEANS IN AND KISSES ME. This is the first time anything physical has happened or that we ever talked about our feelings. 

He keeps kissing me this legit happens like three times in my car and after every time he says we just have to be friends. Then he just leaves and since then he has been so cold and so distant. He met with me once and said he didn’t want to lose our friendship and that he was sorry for kissing me and playing with my feelings and that we can be friends. I’ve tried to be friends but it’s torture. He’s completely started ignoring me, he doesn’t answer my texts, he doesn’t talk to me when he sees me, he treats me like absolute shit and it’s literally a mind game I don’t know why I can’t get over him. I look for his car everytime I come to the library now. I always wonder when’s the next time I’d see him. It’s the first time a man has rejected me like this and played with my mind so badly and it’s making me so insecure about myself. I feel like I’m ugly for letting a man like him walk all over me and reject me so easily. I feel so stupid and awful cause I miss him and keep texting him and he’s clearly in power cause he just ignores me. I hate it. I hate him but I want him so badly.

This sub has been so helpful so far in researching and planning but I’ve hit a point of being over saturated with information and hoping for some help!

I’m not exactly the world traveler but I’ve somehow found myself visiting Korea for a couple days for a dream job interview. I’m hoping I can try and adventure out for as much as possible - mostly to experience a mix of lifestyle (considering the potential job and relocation) and touristy things (if I don’t get the job!)!

Here’s a quick schedule breakdown - 

Day 1 late afternoon - arrive at ICN, travel to Songdo, where I’m staying for my trip. Would love recs for local/nearby things for a quick dinner, interview prep, etc. 

Day 2 - interview day. Pretty much a full day, so I can’t plan for much.

Day 3 - wide open but my flight leaves from ICN at 18:00. I’ve read a lot about arriving 3 hours for international travel, so I definitely want to plan on getting to ICN by 15:00. In general, this is the day for to venture out! 

Let me know if you have an recs about checking out the area (mostly on day 3). I’m very curious about department stores for good food? Trying to maximize a visit to Seoul on a time crunch before I leave. Avoiding overly touristy spots but open to considering them. I love food, coffee, sights, experiences, etc. so open to any recs! It’s going to be such a quick trip I just don’t want to leave without trying my best to make the most of it! I’ll spend more time on the flights than being in Korea!

1os8jdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/newproductsamazon/comments/1os8jdg/is_a_knitting_kit_good_for_group_activities/,Is a knitting kit good for group activities?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting into knitting lately, and a friend asked me if knitting kits would work for their book club's craft night. Honestly, I thought it was a weird combo at first, but then I realized knitting kits are actually perfect for group hangouts.

Here's the thing - when you're sitting around with friends or family, knitting gives your hands something to do while you're chatting. It's not like painting where you need total concentration. You can literally knit and talk at the same time once you get the basic stitches down.

I grabbed a **knitting kit** for beginners a few months ago, and it came with everything needed to get started. No running around to five different stores for needles, yarn, and instructions. If you're planning a group activity, having complete knitting supplies in one package makes it super easy to get everyone set up quickly.

What makes knitting great for groups is that everyone works at their own pace. Some people fly through their projects while others take it slow, and nobody feels rushed or left behind. Plus, you can all work on the same pattern together, which creates this cool shared experience.

I've done knitting circles with coworkers during lunch breaks, and it's way more relaxing than scrolling through my phone. The repetitive motion is actually calming, and you end up with something useful like a scarf or dishcloth instead of just killing time.

For anyone wanting to try this with their friend group, I'd recommend starting with simple projects. Scarves, headbands, or basic dishcloths work perfectly. Don't jump into sweaters right away or someone's gonna get frustrated and quit.

If you're looking to grab supplies for your crew, check out this **[knitting kit selection](https://athomewave.com/knitting-kit)** that has options for different skill levels. I found mine there and it had clear instructions that even my friend who ""can't craft"" could follow.

The best part about knitting as a group hobby is the cost. Compared to pottery classes or escape rooms, buying a few starter kits doesn't break the bank. Everyone gets to keep what they make, and you can keep knitting long after that first group session.

One tip though - make sure your space has good lighting. We tried knitting at a dimly lit coffee shop once and it was rough trying to see the stitches. Bright light makes everything easier, especially when you're learning.

So yeah, if you're planning girls' night, family gatherings, or even team building stuff at work, knitting kits definitely work. It's creative, social, and you're not just staring at screens together. Give it a shot and see if your group vibes with it.

Anyone else done craft activities with their squad? What worked for you?",1,1762657940.0,newproductsamazon,0,1.0,False
1os8ja4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1os8ja4/waiting_for_potential_dating/,Waiting for potential dating ?,"Met a lady through a mutual friends party and her wing-woman who came with her quietly encouraged me to ask her for her number as she was recently single and said she liked me. Eventually found the courage to say I found her interesting and want to know her better, and if I could ask her for her number. She couldn't give me her number fast enough, which was such a relief and a positive sign!

Texted her the following day to thank her for sharing her number and before I could ask her if she wanted to meet, she quickly said she was not looking for a relationship since she just got out of a bad one but looking for a friendship only. I said I understood and through the week texted her questions about her and what was going on with her week. After a few texts she became aggressive and said it looked like I was asking for more than friendship and she would shut me down if I pushed it.

After that I just sent her benign messages at the beginning and end of the week and she responds quickly and pleasantly. I am really interested in her and want to keep her warm in case she comes out of her funk to be ready for a relationship. I can wait and I can be patient for a while.

I want to ask:
a) How to keep her engaged enough to know I am still interested in her as well as give her something beyond the weekly messages? It will soon become borderline creepy if I keep this up.
b) How to bring up the topic of going on a 'friendship' meet up for coffee or lunch without stepping on one of her minefields?

Also, any insight or possible theories from anyone as to what is going on with the mixed signals I am get and what to do is appreciated.

1os8j5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1os8j5l/please_help_cant_lose_weight_been_trying_over_a/,"Please help, can’t lose weight, been trying over a year 😢😢😢","I really need help on what has been proven for effective and safe weight loss after kids and while nursing (and as fast as possible without being at all harmful).

I’m 42 with two kids about two years apart. My whole life I’ve been about 135 pounds (5’7’’) and a size 6 / medium and now I’m 200lb / an extra large /I believe size 10+. 

My facial features are like hidden from the fat, I have a thick neck, fat fingers, thick arms and bat wings, no hour glass shape to speak of—more like an apple, a belly with an overhang like I’m still pregnant (belly fat is the unhealthiest area to have fat), thighs that stick together, a lumpy butt and thighs, a hump on the back of my neck like I’m the hunchback of notre dame…I went from what men I dated (mostly fit and handsome marathon runners, boxers, and soccer players) called hot to totally obesely hideous. 

I have tried pretty hard to lose weight, but after one year having my kid, I’ve only lost 2 pounds (baseline being 10 days after delivering! A time where I was making no effort, was in bed and on the couch nonstop, eating ice cream and serotonin producing not-great foods and lots of eating out).

Since then I’ve switched to home cooked meals, kale omelette nearly every breakfast, salads nearly every lunch, balanced meals every night (for example, tonight was brown rice with meatballs and zucchini), lighter and less calorie heavy snacking, before lunches and dinners often having a powder that is high fiber, high protein, high superfoods, has a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, probiotics, and some essential fatty acids in about 10 ounces of water to help me feel full before my meals and increase my general health and energy. 

I usually drink about 60 ounces of filtered water every day. I have usually one or two lattes with stevia and once in a while I’ll treat myself to a mocha without whipped cream and some cookies and pizza 1-2 times per week and a little organic red wine a few nights a week (4.5 ounces per day max) to prevent feelings of deprivation / giving up entirely.

I’ve tried different supplements, but they make little to no difference and there’s very little I can safely take while breast-feeding so I’ve given up on them, only the powder I mentioned above. They’re also loaded with heavy metals most of them, including the postnatal multivitamin I was taking (I can’t find one that has a clean test report…have you?).

I don’t count calories because those apps have never made it easy so I feel like I’m getting widely inaccurate numbers, and regardless —I’m eating pretty much the exact same as I did when I was 135lb, maybe a little more because breast-feeding has left me more hungry, but not insane amounts. Lowering calories right now lowers milk production so it’s not a good time either.

I am doing “baby-led weaning” so I’m only now feeding roughly every four hours but at night anytime my one-year-old wakes up he wants to feed on me to go back to bed. I think more than anything, it’s the disrupted sleep that has led to the hormones going crazy and just leaving me depleted, hungry, moody, unhappy, stressed, striving for energy and mental clarity constantly, and just in a constant state of disarray.

I’m almost certain I’m suffering from stuff like high cortisol. I’ve never been good at reducing my stress and I really suck at meditation (thus, kind of hate it).

I don’t want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars out of pocket with these crazy high deductible plans just to get a couple of blood tests to check things out because anytime I’ve done that in the past, my results always came out clean/totally normal… and I did all the multiple thyroid, hypothyroid tests, all of that. And what if something is off, they’re just going to prescribe medication that I can’t safely take while nursing anyway, so frankly, I don’t see the point.

I have 65 pounds to lose and at the rate of 2 pounds per year, we’re talking 33 freaking years to get back to my normal weight when I see so many other moms (I’m not talking celebrities with trainers but every day women in my direct local circle) that got their bodies back within a couple of months. Some got them back like literally right after the baby came out. It’s baffling to me how someone dealing with all these hormones can be a twig with a round belly. Anyway, I can’t wait decades, this must go faster! Anytime it goes so slow I get so discouraged that I wanna quit and then I start slipping a little with sugar.

My body seems to want to hold onto every ounce of weight/fat during nursing or something. But I believe in “attachment parenting” and can’t ever imagine cutting off my kid and that special bonding for something as superficial as weight. But I also know at this weight it’s much more serious than just appearance.

My extra weight has led to back pain, pelvic pain, foot and knee pain, shoulder pain, not wanting to be seen in public or by my own husband, etc. 
I try to walk, but my injuries and aches only allow me to do so much. I’ve had a hip injury that’s been extremely stubborn and hasn’t gone away for almost 10 years now. Pretty much the only solution seems to be surgery, which I refuse to do at such a young age, it just causes so many problems, so long story short, I can’t do high impact stuff. I get really bored with gyms and stuff so for me, I need something like sports and it’s hard to find one that is not high impact. Especially when you’re competitive. Swimming is one but that’s one that makes you hungrier due to the temperature drop (that’s why walruses, whales, and other sea animals are thicker than animals like cheetahs and horses).

I fight sugar and caffeine cravings a lot, sometimes even nicotine. In the past, I relied on caffeine a lot for an energy and mood lift and sort of an appetite suppressant. Same with v@ping and supplements to help with sugar cravings and appetite control and metabolism boosts. I also detoxed a lot to help get rid of sugar cravings (stuff like coffee enemas and infrared sauna sessions) and I did a combination of water-only fasting and intermittent fasting, and I restricted carbs but I can’t do any of that while nursing. And I wonder, was it restricting carbs that has slowed down my metabolism? Is it bad to do that long-term?

And then there is the emotional element of eating which I am leaning more on because I’m often frustrated a lot from the lack of freedom and how hard it is to take care of two young kids, and ever since pregnancy started, but especially after, it has really taken a toll on my relationship with my husband. I’m just often very angry and on edge and moody, and feel lack of emotional support which makes me feel a void and resentful toward my husband. Having kids has also increased my anxiety, which has made me more controlling, striving for a sense of order, especially so my kids get enough rest, are developed well, etc.

And I also like a lot of flavor in my foods, I was raised in a culture that uses a lot of olive oil and a lot of salt and a lot of seasoning and to have bland food feels like a sort of joyless prison.

And every psychologist/ therapist I have ever seen has just utterly failed me, I find it such a waste of time, never any results. I don’t need anyone to talk to, I just need someone who can change negative thoughts and habits and after seeing maybe a dozen therapists over the years, it’s just impossible to find someone who can actually make a noticeable difference. I even tried hypnotherapy and trauma therapy (was abused as a kid) but nope, I’m in the same boat. I feel like all they do is drain your bank account and your time.

Anyway, if any of you have faced a similar situation or have suggestions on what may work in my circumstances, is proven safe during nursing, etc. please share.

Amy walks into the office at 8:02. More than a little amazed she could pull it off. Monday is always skirt and heels day because you have to own Monday and the rest of the week is easy. The stockings she wore were for the Silver Fox. He deserved to be tormented after this mornings activities. She still had the collar on but was barely noticeable with the blouse and blazer. It was going to be a busy morning with 2 conference calls. She walked into her office a large gift bag was setting on her desk, with a note on it. She opened the note. 

“I know you were lying. This has to be your favorite.” She opened the bag and chuckled. It was a 5 pound bag of Gold Medal all purpose flour. What a romantic goof ball. I will get even though. 

XOXOXOXO

Dan knocked on Charlie’s door that was only half way closed. 

“Thanks for the assist yesterday my friend.” Dan says with a smile and a handshake. 

“So what’s the joke with Amy?”Charlie asks. 

“Oh, just my favorite clean joke. That’s for another day.”

“So how was the weekend?”

“Are you being an ass or are you serious?”

“Kim and I have been out of town for the last four days. Had just gotten home when you called. I know nothing.”

“Amy and I spent the weekend together. Even took her to church and Sunday supper.”

“About time. You dirty old man.” Both laughed out loud like only old friends do.

“What do you mean, about time?”

“Dan ever since she started here in January, my old friend is back. That rye sense of humor, a peace took over. You stoped being an on edge asshole!”

“Christ, I love you too man!”

XOXOXOXO

She settled in and got to work. Looked up finally and it was ten o’clock. Time to get a cup of coffee and touch base with everyone. There were only 3 people in the break room. She no more than got her coffee poured and work BFF walks in. Sarah walks up to her looking a cross between amused and horny. 

“You have been holding out on me! My work bestie!” Sarah says.

“My office ASAP.” Amy says and winks. 

“Everyone knows already.”

“Yes, but I know the dirty details though!” Amy says giggling. 

Amy spends a few minutes catching up on different people’s weekends. Asking about ballgames and prom. She returns to her office and thirty seconds later Sarah walks in closing the door behind her. 

“So I hear you had to go to church Sunday to repent for your sins of sleeping with the boss! So how many weeks have you been keeping it from me?”

Amy blushes. “I haven’t kept anything thing from you.”

“Well the story is your sleeping with him. When did it start?”

“Friday.”

“So how many weeks ago Friday?”

“No Friday.” Amy says, feeling like a slut. 

“You mean Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Just last Friday? You slut! Good for you!”

“You know how Friday, Dan was chasing everyone out of the office to go home and spend time with the family? Well we got talking about the farm and the new babies he has and invited me out for hamburgers and told me to bring brownies and would do sundaes for dessert.”

“The old baby animal, burgers and dessert trick. It’s gotten the best of us!” Sarah says laughing. 

“Shut up. So I decided I wanted to break the dry spell so did a little sluty farm girl thing. We did chores, laughed, held hands and had fun. Sarah he is so cute and sexy and couldn’t care less about it. We go in and starts making supper. He puts on country music and we start dancing in the kitchen. By the time we get done dancing I’m begging him to take me!”

“So is he any good in bed?”

“Sarah this man is a sex god!” They both giggled.

“So why the BDSM collar? Are you his submissive now?”

“I want to tell you no. But…..”

“Amy you deserve this.” Sarah walks out the door. Leaving Amy pinching herself hoping the dream doesn’t end. 

At 11:30 Dan popped his head into Amy’s office. “I have a lunch meeting with a contractor so can’t do lunch.”

“Not a problem but I need you here at 4:30 to do something to me.”

“You bet boss, I’ll see you then.” Off he goes to lunch.

“The Silver Fox doesn’t even know when he’s being propositioned. How cute can you be.” Amy thinks to herself. Two minutes later a text shows up on her phone from Dan. 

To you or for you?!?!

Amy decided to show him. She took a picture of her thong, garter and hose.  The caption read “Figure it out Daddy.” In 30 seconds another text comes through. 

DAMN BABY GIRL!

Amy grabbed a light lunch and ate in the break room with everyone who wasn’t in the field. Then back to her office to prepare for client meetings on the road Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning. 

At 2:30 AnnMarie the receptionist popped her head in. “Special delivery.” She was holding a dozen pink roses. “These have your name on them.” 

She set them on the desk, then went back and closed the door. 

“You’ve been good for him Amy. Many of us saw it coming.”

“Wish someone would have clued me in.”

“Since you showed up he started smiling again. He hasn’t snapped at anyone since you’ve been around. I’m not going to tell stories but Tracy had her problems too. Don’t think for one second you two don’t deserve to be happy.” With that she was gone.

She opened the card read, “you were right Google didn’t care about flowers.” If he wanted to he would, ran through her brain. 

XOXOXOXOXO

A little after four Amy receives a text. 

In my office.  Ready for you any time. 

Amy gathers up a couple things that need reviewed before she leaves on Wednesday. As she is about to leave, a dirty thought crosses her mind.  Office sex has always been a naughty dream.  It might be time for that dream to come true. She slips her thong off and places it in one of the files. It might “accidentally” fall out at an inappropriate moment. Then reaches into her purse and pulls out a small bottle of lube that she had made this morning for “emergency situations”. Slips it in a jacket pocket. She unbuttoned another button on her blouse and opened it to make the collar more visible then heads to the Silver Fox’s office. 

She knocks on Dan’s office door. He calls her in. She had been in his office many times before, but it felt different this time. Almost inviting.  Pictures of family and grandchildren hung on the walls. Along with a couple western pieces and a few landscapes from the farm that Dan had taken. 

They got down to business ran the two presentations and double checked the numbers. Dan asks “anything more?”

“No. We are good.”

“Good off the clock. How was your day Baby Girl?”

“Good, no blow back. Only problem is a jerk sent me all purpose flour and my favorite is cake flour!”

“Dually noted. What did Sarah have to say?”

“That I’m a slut and congratulations.”

“Yes you are.” Amy eyebrows go up, “but you’re my slut and I plan to keep it that way. I have something to show you.”

Dan grabs a bag and hands it to her. “Open it.”

Amy opens it and it’s a framed photograph of her feeding the bottle calf Friday night. She is standing there feeding him and scratching the calf’s head. She stares at her smile the simplicity and wholesomeness.  “I look beautiful in this picture. You need take more pictures of me.”

“Yes you do. That’s why it’s going on my desk.” He sets it on the corner of his desk. Next to a picture of Tracy, that he picks up and places in a bottom desk drawer. 

 OXOXOXOXO


Amy says, “I brought something for you.” She reaches into the file folder and grabs her thong. Hands it to Dan. “I have a fantasy that I want to live out.” She slowly strips off her blazer and hangs it on a chair. Then opens her blouse slowly. “I am the slutty secretary, Miss Jensen. I work for a powerful boss, Mr C, who is a Silver Fox. I’m responsible for providing sexual release for him. The only way to do that is anal sex in his office on his desk.” She pulls up the front of her skirt to show him her garter but no thong. “Can you help me with that fantasy Daddy?”

“Well Miss Jensen, you were hired to perform certain duties here around the office.” Dan takes off his shirt setting it aside and walks over removing Amy’s shirt and spinning her around to unzip her skirt. “You have not been performing those duties at the level I am accustomed to.”

“I’m sorry Mr C I’ll try to do better.” She reaches up and unhooked her bra and let if fall to the floor. “Let me see if I can complete today’s assignment.” She walks over and removes his cock and begins giving the sloppiest blow job she knows how. Taking him down her throat as far as she can and holds him in her throat. Drawing a grown from Mr C. Then backing off leaving him sopping wet. She walks over to her jacket and pulls out the lube. 

“That was much better start Miss Jensen. Now bend over the desk like you were taught.” She moves over and bends over at the waist resting her chest on the desk. 

“Like this Mr C.” Reaching back and spreading her cheeks. Immediately Mr C dives in eating pussy and licking her ass. In no great hurry, spending time on her clit and lips nibbling and kissing. 

“Mr C if you keep that up I’m going to squirt!” Mr C took that as a challenge and in a few seconds his face was soaked. He stripped off his pants and slid into the freshly eaten pussy. Pumping hard and fast to bring on another orgasm. 

“Oh fuck Mr C I’m going to cum again! Harder I’m your slut!” That’s when it hits and she screams into the desk. 

Mr. C steps way and grabs the bottle of lube. He lubes up his cock and a couple fingers to start getting her ready. Slowly sliding the first finger then two fingers and more lube. “Miss Jensen, now we find out if you remember how to please me.” Slowly applying pressure to her hole with his cock, while rubbing her clit. 

Miss Jensen pushes her ass back onto his rock hard cock and and soon feels the balls slamming into her pussy. This is when she losses all track of time and space. She remembers at one point Mr C pulling out and flipping her onto her back on the desk. Her heels resting on his shoulders.  The heels got tossed aside and her toes in Mr C’s mouth. That’s when an orgasm hit. Then she remembered being carried to the couch and Mr C praising her for being a good slut. 

She remembered asking Mr C “Am I doing a good job sir?” As she was being placed in doggy position. Then feeling his cock entering her again. 

Mr C finally finished in her ass. Calling her a good slut as he filled her up. 

When Amy finally gained control of her senses, Dan was in full after care mode. He was holding her on the couch kissing her and saying “Baby Girl, I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did. You make a very good naughty secretary.”

“Thank you Daddy. Just hold me and tell me how much you love me.”

### Part 1
He smiled and kicked back in his chair, the two back legs teetering like skates as the sun cascaded through the dated glass above his kitchen sink. He knew it was old, but he liked it that way. He loved the way the sunlight splintered through, sending beams of light rippling through his ritualistic morning cup of orange juice. There was a newspaper on the table, but he hated them. He had nothing to do today, so he sat, enjoying the smell of over easy eggs with peppers and cheese drifting through the apartment.
It reminded him of that time Sarah and him spent the weekend at Lake Erie, breakfasts with sunrise and afternoons spent walking Atlas on the beach trying to get him to go in the water, laughing hysterically as his legs scrambled through the waves, his neck stretched out, eyes shot wide open, fur sticking out in porcupine-like spikes. They felt bad but it was a sight to see. They finished laughing and sat down on a taupe piece of driftwood, which they later used as a centerpiece for the monolithic aquarium they had in the corner of his apartment’s bedroom.
When she spent the night, Sarah loved to wake up watching the red guppies flutter about like pairs waltzing in the Grand Concourse. Every morning, when he managed to pull himself out of bed, he’d look over and see her sprinkling flakes of wonder to the fish below as they darted to the surface to feast as if their next meal wasn’t promised to them. She’d sing Amazing Grace while she did it, and after she was done, she’d turn to smile at him, a dimple beautifully nesting into her right cheek as it always did. It was during these moments that he knew he’d marry her. 
A two carat marquise was going for a touch over a grand, and he didn’t have much money but he saw the way her face lit up as they walked by jewelry store at 18th and Forbes. The Russian running the register with a face shield covered in an amalgam of silver shavings and rouge didn’t say much, scoffing as he tossed the ring on the counter next to that day’s issue. Something about a hostage situation in Jordan. Paying little mind but a fair bit of cash, he left the jewelry store sweating.
Sarah jumped into his arms as soon as he pulled the ring out, her tears forming a puddle in his collarbone. He had been all worked up for nothing, she was thrilled beyond all measure. They got married that May, the forsythia covering the knoll next to the stables on her father’s barn. He spent all his money on her ring, so they had to move in with Sarah’s parents. The wedding picture of them on her childhood tire swing sat next to pepper on his stove. The glass was cracked and it had a white fragment in the center, but he didn’t pay that any mind. He flipped the eggs and smiled at the picture.

### Part 2
He lit a Marlboro 100 and put a hand through his five-o’-clock shadow. He burnt his eggs. Too worried about the newspaper that sat on the checkered table. How did people give a damn about the European Union? He hated newspapers. He ashed his cigarette on the eggs before he washed the pan out. It was one of those woks that she insisted to wash lightly so it didn’t lose its cure. His teeth clung onto the butt like a hangover clings to your Sunday morning. He looked at the picture.
Next to that tire swing is where it happened. Sarah told him she wanted to stop taking her medication. He insisted that she keep going for just a little while longer. Sarah was screaming now, saying that he thought she was crazy. I don’t think you’re crazy. You’ve made so much progress and I don’t want to see you struggle again. Whatever.
Sarah woke up screaming and shaking. He flung himself on top of her, trying to be her safety blanket so she didn’t grab anything sharp. He looked at the amber bottle of pills sitting on her nightstand. It was almost full. He didn’t know how to do it, but she needed to get back on those pills. By noon she had calmed. She sat in the conservatory, staring out the window at a pair of cardinals, flitting about by the deck railings.
In the coming months, he had gotten Sarah back on her medication. She seemed happy, but she was always tired. Her mother had died, and it was taking a toll on her. He knew he had to get her out of that house, so he mentioned the idea of getting an apartment downtown together. Sarah agreed. She needed to get out of that house.
The apartment was the same one he was sitting in now. It was nothing to write home about, but it was enough room for them. They were hoping to start a family soon and things were going well. Sarah had found a teaching job in the South Hills, and he was pouring concrete for a company in Mount Lebanon. They were putting enough in savings to start trying. Three weeks after their two year anniversary, at the Grandview, Sarah told him she was pregnant. They sat there and laughed. They laughed for hours. He couldn’t wait. Couldn’t believe this was happening.
He finished washing the wok and looked over from the stove into the bedroom. The crib had speckled sunlight shining on it from the window above the sink. He sat down at the table and lit another cigarette. After some minutes, some ash fluttered down onto the newspaper. He hated newspapers.

### Part 3
It was twenty-two hundred the next day. Couldn’t sleep. He took another pull of Jack. He was looking at the picture, which he set on the coffee table. It still had the same crack in the glass. The same white fragment in the center. He took another pull of Jack. There was a newspaper next to the picture frame. Something about a unit in Syria. They weren’t getting it that bad. He could still see that hijab. He fucking hated newspapers. He took another pull of Jack. He put it down next to the stack of coasters they got in Erie.
He was thinking about when Sarah was flipping the top coaster through her fingers. She was nine months pregnant but real sick. I’m real sick babe. He snapped to and took a pull of Jack, then faded back. Sarah said I’m real sick. He knew her pill bottle was full. It’s not your fault love, I promise. Sarah said I can’t keep doing this. He looked at her with a confused brow. He said how can you leave me? We’re about to have a kid. I love you. Where would you even go?
The sunlight caught a flash of silver. He couldn’t catch the hammer in time. He didn’t catch it in time. He caught her before she fell off the chair. Behind him, a piece of her temple was stuck in the picture frame. Shattered the glass. Red. He snapped to, Jack, faded back. Her left eye was on the newspaper on the coffee table. He fucking hated newspapers. Why is your pill bottle full? Sarah’s eye on the newspaper was watching him. He fucking hated newspapers. Why didn’t you catch the hammer? Those guys in Syria weren’t getting it that bad. 
He came to, and took a pull of Jack. He put one through his left femur, but this time he didn’t want to catch the hammer. That’s for not catching it in time. It’s your fault. He took the newspaper out of the box, still had the stain on it. He fucking hated newspapers. Jack. If you were faster you would’ve caught the hammer. You should’ve kept the thirty eight locked. You insisted on having it. Should’ve kept it locked. Your fault. 
He knew she was sick, he could have put the meds in her food or something. He should’ve it was his fault. One through the right femur. This time he didn’t want to catch the hammer. That’s for not putting the meds in her food. He looked over at the crib. No sunlight. He took the fragment out of the picture frame and looked at it. The glass fell loose. Red. You should’ve put the meds in her food. Your fault. This time he didn’t wan’t to catch the hammer.",1,1762657746.0,BetaReaders,2,1.0,False
1os8h1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moms/comments/1os8h1d/please_help_cant_lose_weight_been_trying_over_a/,"Please help, can’t lose weight, been trying over a year 😢😢😢","I really need help on what has been proven for effective and safe weight loss after kids and while nursing (and as fast as possible without being at all harmful).

I’m 42 with two kids about two years apart. My whole life I’ve been about 135 pounds (5’7’’) and a size 6 / medium and now I’m 200lb / an extra large /I believe size 10+. 

My facial features are like hidden from the fat, I have a thick neck, fat fingers, thick arms and bat wings, no hour glass shape to speak of—more like an apple, a belly with an overhang like I’m still pregnant (belly fat is the unhealthiest area to have fat), thighs that stick together, a lumpy butt and thighs, a hump on the back of my neck like I’m the hunchback of notre dame…I went from what men I dated (mostly fit and handsome marathon runners, boxers, and soccer players) called hot to totally obesely hideous. 

I have tried pretty hard to lose weight, but after one year having my kid, I’ve only lost 2 pounds (baseline being 10 days after delivering! A time where I was making no effort, was in bed and on the couch nonstop, eating ice cream and serotonin producing not-great foods and lots of eating out).

Since then I’ve switched to home cooked meals, kale omelette nearly every breakfast, salads nearly every lunch, balanced meals every night (for example, tonight was brown rice with meatballs and zucchini), lighter and less calorie heavy snacking, before lunches and dinners often having a powder that is high fiber, high protein, high superfoods, has a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, probiotics, and some essential fatty acids in about 10 ounces of water to help me feel full before my meals and increase my general health and energy. 

I usually drink about 60 ounces of filtered water every day. I have usually one or two lattes with stevia and once in a while I’ll treat myself to a mocha without whipped cream and some cookies and pizza 1-2 times per week and a little organic red wine a few nights a week (4.5 ounces per day max) to prevent feelings of deprivation / giving up entirely.

I’ve tried different supplements, but they make little to no difference and there’s very little I can safely take while breast-feeding so I’ve given up on them, only the powder I mentioned above. They’re also loaded with heavy metals most of them, including the postnatal multivitamin I was taking (I can’t find one that has a clean test report…have you?).

I don’t count calories because those apps have never made it easy so I feel like I’m getting widely inaccurate numbers, and regardless —I’m eating pretty much the exact same as I did when I was 135lb, maybe a little more because breast-feeding has left me more hungry, but not insane amounts. Lowering calories right now lowers milk production so it’s not a good time either.

I am doing “baby-led weaning” so I’m only now feeding roughly every four hours but at night anytime my one-year-old wakes up he wants to feed on me to go back to bed. I think more than anything, it’s the disrupted sleep that has led to the hormones going crazy and just leaving me depleted, hungry, moody, unhappy, stressed, striving for energy and mental clarity constantly, and just in a constant state of disarray.

I’m almost certain I’m suffering from stuff like high cortisol. I’ve never been good at reducing my stress and I really suck at meditation (thus, kind of hate it).

I don’t want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars out of pocket with these crazy high deductible plans just to get a couple of blood tests to check things out because anytime I’ve done that in the past, my results always came out clean/totally normal… and I did all the multiple thyroid, hypothyroid tests, all of that. And what if something is off, they’re just going to prescribe medication that I can’t safely take while nursing anyway, so frankly, I don’t see the point.

I have 65 pounds to lose and at the rate of 2 pounds per year, we’re talking 33 freaking years to get back to my normal weight when I see so many other moms (I’m not talking celebrities with trainers but every day women in my direct local circle) that got their bodies back within a couple of months. Some got them back like literally right after the baby came out. It’s baffling to me how someone dealing with all these hormones can be a twig with a round belly. Anyway, I can’t wait decades, this must go faster! Anytime it goes so slow I get so discouraged that I wanna quit and then I start slipping a little with sugar.

My body seems to want to hold onto every ounce of weight/fat during nursing or something. But I believe in “attachment parenting” and can’t ever imagine cutting off my kid and that special bonding for something as superficial as weight. But I also know at this weight it’s much more serious than just appearance.

My extra weight has led to back pain, pelvic pain, foot and knee pain, shoulder pain, not wanting to be seen in public or by my own husband, etc. 
I try to walk, but my injuries and aches only allow me to do so much. I’ve had a hip injury that’s been extremely stubborn and hasn’t gone away for almost 10 years now. Pretty much the only solution seems to be surgery, which I refuse to do at such a young age, it just causes so many problems, so long story short, I can’t do high impact stuff. I get really bored with gyms and stuff so for me, I need something like sports and it’s hard to find one that is not high impact. Especially when you’re competitive. Swimming is one but that’s one that makes you hungrier due to the temperature drop (that’s why walruses, whales, and other sea animals are thicker than animals like cheetahs and horses).

I fight sugar and caffeine cravings a lot, sometimes even nicotine. In the past, I relied on caffeine a lot for an energy and mood lift and sort of an appetite suppressant. Same with v@ping and supplements to help with sugar cravings and appetite control and metabolism boosts. I also detoxed a lot to help get rid of sugar cravings (stuff like coffee enemas and infrared sauna sessions) and I did a combination of water-only fasting and intermittent fasting, and I restricted carbs but I can’t do any of that while nursing. And I wonder, was it restricting carbs that has slowed down my metabolism? Is it bad to do that long-term?

And then there is the emotional element of eating which I am leaning more on because I’m often frustrated a lot from the lack of freedom and how hard it is to take care of two young kids, and ever since pregnancy started, but especially after, it has really taken a toll on my relationship with my husband. I’m just often very angry and on edge and moody, and feel lack of emotional support which makes me feel a void and resentful toward my husband. Having kids has also increased my anxiety, which has made me more controlling, striving for a sense of order, especially so my kids get enough rest, are developed well, etc.

And I also like a lot of flavor in my foods, I was raised in a culture that uses a lot of olive oil and a lot of salt and a lot of seasoning and to have bland food feels like a sort of joyless prison.

And every psychologist/ therapist I have ever seen has just utterly failed me, I find it such a waste of time, never any results. I don’t need anyone to talk to, I just need someone who can change negative thoughts and habits and after seeing maybe a dozen therapists over the years, it’s just impossible to find someone who can actually make a noticeable difference. I even tried hypnotherapy and trauma therapy (was abused as a kid) but nope, I’m in the same boat. I feel like all they do is drain your bank account and your time.

Anyway, if any of you have faced a similar situation or have suggestions on what may work in my circumstances, is proven safe during nursing, etc. please share.

Now it's time for me to find a match. Here's about me

I [M22] recently moved to Bangalore and am excited to meet new people, build connections, and explore the city. I’d describe myself as a non-judgmental person with a decent sense of humour who believes in finding happiness in the little things— a warm cup of coffee, a friendly dog, or a pretty sunset can make my day. 
My life so far has been a mix of failures, learnings, and successes, and I’m grateful for all of it. I’m career-oriented but also believe that work is just one part of life—not the whole of it. I can be a couch potato or an explorer depending on the day. 
Web series, card games, cooking, and TMKOC are my favourite ways to unwind. I’m a selective extrovert—if we share some common interests, I’d love to spend time together. I enjoy trekking, cracking jokes, and completely lose track of time when I’m around dogs—they’re the purest examples of love and loyalty. 
Hitting the gym at the end of the day helps me relax my mind and soul. I’m a big fan of 90s songs and movies that revolve around deep emotions and genuine connections. Empathy and open-mindedness mean a lot to me, and I don’t enjoy negative or overly judgmental company

1os8ao8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/1os8ao8/please_help_ive_tried_to_lose_weight_and_it_just/,"Please help, I’ve tried to lose weight and it just isn’t happening for over a year 😢😢","I really need help on what has been proven for effective and safe weight loss after kids and while nursing (and as fast as possible without being at all harmful).

I’m 42 with two kids about two years apart. My whole life I’ve been about 135 pounds (5’7’’) and a size 6 / medium and now I’m 200lb / an extra large /I believe size 10+. 

My facial features are like hidden from the fat, I have a thick neck, fat fingers, thick arms and bat wings, no hour glass shape to speak of—more like an apple, a belly with an overhang like I’m still pregnant (belly fat is the unhealthiest area to have fat), thighs that stick together, a lumpy butt and thighs, a hump on the back of my neck like I’m the hunchback of notre dame…I went from what men I dated (mostly fit and handsome marathon runners, boxers, and soccer players) called hot to totally obesely hideous. 

I have tried pretty hard to lose weight, but after one year having my kid, I’ve only lost 2 pounds (baseline being 10 days after delivering! A time where I was making no effort, was in bed and on the couch nonstop, eating ice cream and serotonin producing not-great foods and lots of eating out).

Since then I’ve switched to home cooked meals, kale omelette nearly every breakfast, salads nearly every lunch, balanced meals every night (for example, tonight was brown rice with meatballs and zucchini), lighter and less calorie heavy snacking, before lunches and dinners often having a powder that is high fiber, high protein, high superfoods, has a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, probiotics, and some essential fatty acids in about 10 ounces of water to help me feel full before my meals and increase my general health and energy. 

I usually drink about 60 ounces of filtered water every day. I have usually one or two lattes with stevia and once in a while I’ll treat myself to a mocha without whipped cream and some cookies and pizza 1-2 times per week and a little organic red wine a few nights a week (4.5 ounces per day max) to prevent feelings of deprivation / giving up entirely.

I’ve tried different supplements, but they make little to no difference and there’s very little I can safely take while breast-feeding so I’ve given up on them, only the powder I mentioned above. They’re also loaded with heavy metals most of them, including the postnatal multivitamin I was taking (I can’t find one that has a clean test report…have you?).

I don’t count calories because those apps have never made it easy so I feel like I’m getting widely inaccurate numbers, and regardless —I’m eating pretty much the exact same as I did when I was 135lb, maybe a little more because breast-feeding has left me more hungry, but not insane amounts. Lowering calories right now lowers milk production so it’s not a good time either.

I am doing “baby-led weaning” so I’m only now feeding roughly every four hours but at night anytime my one-year-old wakes up he wants to feed on me to go back to bed. I think more than anything, it’s the disrupted sleep that has led to the hormones going crazy and just leaving me depleted, hungry, moody, unhappy, stressed, striving for energy and mental clarity constantly, and just in a constant state of disarray.

I’m almost certain I’m suffering from stuff like high cortisol. I’ve never been good at reducing my stress and I really suck at meditation (thus, kind of hate it).

I don’t want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars out of pocket with these crazy high deductible plans just to get a couple of blood tests to check things out because anytime I’ve done that in the past, my results always came out clean/totally normal… and I did all the multiple thyroid, hypothyroid tests, all of that. And what if something is off, they’re just going to prescribe medication that I can’t safely take while nursing anyway, so frankly, I don’t see the point.

I have 65 pounds to lose and at the rate of 2 pounds per year, we’re talking 33 freaking years to get back to my normal weight when I see so many other moms (I’m not talking celebrities with trainers but every day women in my direct local circle) that got their bodies back within a couple of months. Some got them back like literally right after the baby came out. It’s baffling to me how someone dealing with all these hormones can be a twig with a round belly. Anyway, I can’t wait decades, this must go faster! Anytime it goes so slow I get so discouraged that I wanna quit and then I start slipping a little with sugar.

My body seems to want to hold onto every ounce of weight/fat during nursing or something. But I believe in “attachment parenting” and can’t ever imagine cutting off my kid and that special bonding for something as superficial as weight. But I also know at this weight it’s much more serious than just appearance.

My extra weight has led to back pain, pelvic pain, foot and knee pain, shoulder pain, not wanting to be seen in public or by my own husband, etc. 
I try to walk, but my injuries and aches only allow me to do so much. I’ve had a hip injury that’s been extremely stubborn and hasn’t gone away for almost 10 years now. Pretty much the only solution seems to be surgery, which I refuse to do at such a young age, it just causes so many problems, so long story short, I can’t do high impact stuff. I get really bored with gyms and stuff so for me, I need something like sports and it’s hard to find one that is not high impact. Especially when you’re competitive. Swimming is one but that’s one that makes you hungrier due to the temperature drop (that’s why walruses, whales, and other sea animals are thicker than animals like cheetahs and horses).

I fight sugar and caffeine cravings a lot, sometimes even nicotine. In the past, I relied on caffeine a lot for an energy and mood lift and sort of an appetite suppressant. Same with v@ping and supplements to help with sugar cravings and appetite control and metabolism boosts. I also detoxed a lot to help get rid of sugar cravings (stuff like coffee enemas and infrared sauna sessions) and I did a combination of water-only fasting and intermittent fasting, and I restricted carbs but I can’t do any of that while nursing. And I wonder, was it restricting carbs that has slowed down my metabolism? Is it bad to do that long-term?

And then there is the emotional element of eating which I am leaning more on because I’m often frustrated a lot from the lack of freedom and how hard it is to take care of two young kids, and ever since pregnancy started, but especially after, it has really taken a toll on my relationship with my husband. I’m just often very angry and on edge and moody, and feel lack of emotional support which makes me feel a void and resentful toward my husband. Having kids has also increased my anxiety, which has made me more controlling, striving for a sense of order, especially so my kids get enough rest, are developed well, etc.

And I also like a lot of flavor in my foods, I was raised in a culture that uses a lot of olive oil and a lot of salt and a lot of seasoning and to have bland food feels like a sort of joyless prison.

And every psychologist/ therapist I have ever seen has just utterly failed me, I find it such a waste of time, never any results.

So for 7 days this is what I did and it worked for me and I could potentially do this same routine every day for the next 3 months to lower my hba1c to non diabetic range

Morning: bolus 4 units for black coffee and oat milk at 6am

  
7 am bolus 8 units for peanut butter sandwich

  
Bg would be flatlined to the 140s 130s

  
11am lunch would be beef pot roast, mashed potatoes, carrots and green beans and bolus would be 3 units

  
And dinner would be Madras lentils that has lentils, red beans, spices and tomato sauce...bolus for 4 units

  
Bg would be flatlined in the 140s and 130s for 7 days I would bolus 2 units before bed if my bg is 140 to 150 and it would be flatlined in good range over night...didn't experience lows for these 7 days...my low alarm is set at 90

  
Now last night was strange.....my bg was flatlined in the 110s , and 100s the whole night that i was sleeping which was strange and scary, woke up

  
Bolused for black coffee and oat milk in the morning at 6am, then 7am I bolus 4 units for peanut butter sandwich not 8...4 and to my surprise my bg didn't skyrocket because I lowered my dose for​...and I didnt go low either...straight lined I was just wow...just imagined if I did 8 units instead of 4 I would've been in severe hypoglycemia 

  
Im on dexcom g7 and mdi (semglee and humalog)...been living with it for 1 year now and I got diagnosed at age 27

  
My question is...why did my insulin needs decreased????

For the record - my partner can be incredibly oblivious,  and he does not like it when I say it. This isn't something he is trying to do, but I dont know how to handle this hypothetical question (that I brought up)

We had been friends for over 4 years. I had been developing feelings for him for awhile. We started hanging out more one on one (im a year and a half older than him and always dated older - he was NOT on my radar until I was about 28/29). I remember going to a scary movie and used that excuse to hold his hand the entire night (I am not generally a touchy person).

When we left that night, we hugged at least 10 times with me staring into his eyes hoping for a kiss before finally leaving. The next time we hung out, first time we were one on one I finally confessed I ""had the feels"" for him. He got all smiley and said he felt the same way. We wentt around the corner and kissed. Due to him being part of the ""friend circle,"" i wanted to be sure before we told them anything - he didnt give a fuck. With his friends, outside our group, he always introduced me as the gril he was going to marry.

Part of this is that he may be a little ""neuro-divergent."" I am his first long term relationship - and we've made it to 7 years. He gets hung up on little details sometimes.

It took us awhile to get on the same page of women coming on to him - he legit didnt think it was happening/didnt notice. There was one woman who literally reached across me to rub his thigh a bunch and commented, several times, that she was in a polyamorous relationship. We talked about it later, and he was just like - new friend! Wait, what? Don't remember them touching me...

Both of us our very monogamous. No question of that. I thought we were on the same page of not hanging out with people of the opposite sex one on one, at their place. And he hasn't- we kind of are on the same page there.

But what are your thoughts on people in a long term relationship hanging our with people of the opposite sex (or whichever you are attacked to).

My parents have been married for over 50 years. My friends who are married/long term relationships would agree with this - hanging out like that could lead to problems. I just think its a good idea to avoid those situations. Grab some coffee! Get lunch! And he doesnt just go over and hang out with women at their place... but the man doesnt like to be told what to do and I am having a difficult time explaining WHY this could be an issue ""when its just platonic"" (again, this is really hypothetical)

Any insight? Apologies if I dodnt explain things well - emphasis on us being monogamous. He rarely even hangs out other people. Don't want reddit to come and do the whole ""he's cheating"" thing. We are together 98% of the time outside of work and school. Both homebodies.",1,1762656896.0,LifeAdvice,6,1.0,False
1os85z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterloo/comments/1os85z3/will_we_ever_see_the_return_of_latenight_cafes_in/,Will we ever see the return of late-night cafes in the uptown/university area?,"Cafes are hands-down my favourite kind of place to study/work for a few reasons:

* good coffee and snacks
* atmosphere/ambient stimulation, stuff like lighting, smells, and the perfect amount of background noise
* more relaxed vibes than campus or the libraries
* constantly running into people I know or meeting new folks, or even just bantering with the staff. It really lets me feel closer to the community

I had some group plans fall through tonight so I decided to just get some studying done. Today is a Saturday, so luckily Cafe 1842 at Huether is open until 10. However my options are much more limited on weekdays, with basically all the options near campus/uptown (except for Williams and Sweet Dreams) closing around 8pm.

After searching through this subreddit looking for new places open late, I came across a few people that mentioned a lot of them actually used to be open later pre-pandemic. For example Princess until 10:30 and Williams until 1am. I've heard from others that Midnight Run used to be open later as well (giving slightly more credence to its name lol).

It's no secret that the pandemic really hammered a lot of these businesses, especially the ones with long operating hours. It's really unfortunate though, because judging by my conversations with friends and other folks it seems like there's a massive appetite in this city for cafes that stay open late, especially around exam season.

So my question for those who work in or tangent to the industry, and just the folks here in general: how likely is it that these businesses will go back to pre-pandemic operating hours, or even beyond at some point? Vancouver has [Breka](https://www.breka.ca/), a chain of lovely 24-hour cafes and I'm sure Toronto has a few as well. Perhaps the demand for such a thing is lower here, but I would love to see more spots stay open until midnight or later. What about you guys?",26,1762656823.0,waterloo,6,0.91,False

I have been through surgeries before, but this one has been on another level. The pain is not just in my shoulder, it runs from the top of my shoulder through my forearm and down into my hand, sometimes all the way into my palm. It is a deep, aching, nerve-type pain that makes me shiver when it spikes.

I have been following all the rules: PT, icing, sleeping propped up, gentle pendulums, and being careful with movement. Thankfully I have had a steady supply of pain pills, and they are the only thing that takes the edge off, but they do not get rid of the pain. I also take gabapentin three times a day, which helps a bit with the nerve pain, but mornings are still rough.

Some days give me hope, like last Thursday when I woke up feeling great and even went out for coffee with no meds. Then the next day it all came roaring back after a tough PT session.

Over the past year, he’s started taking his ring off a lot when we spend time together, including not wearing it at all on a business trip the two of us went on together. On this trip in particular he make comments about how we kept getting one check so we must look like a couple, paid for my ticket to activities we did, sat real close when there was plenty of space.

One particular instance we got food, he insisted on paying, and then wanted us to park behind an old building and just chill in the car and eat instead of going back to the office. 

He also invites me to go with him to run little errands during the workday, and apparently got told that if he kept doing this he was going to get written up. I’ve met his kids several times, but have never met his wife.

1os80nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightlossafterbaby/comments/1os80nb/please_help_cant_lose_any_weight/,Please help! Can’t lose any weight 😢😢😢,"I really need help on what has been proven for effective and safe weight loss after kids and while nursing (and as fast as possible without being at all harmful).

I’m 42 with two kids about two years apart. My whole life I’ve been about 135 pounds (5’7’’) and a size 6 / medium and now I’m 200lb / an extra large /I believe size 10+. 

My facial features are like hidden from the fat, I have a thick neck, fat fingers, thick arms and bat wings, no hour glass shape to speak of—more like an apple, a belly with an overhang like I’m still pregnant (belly fat is the unhealthiest area to have fat), thighs that stick together, a lumpy butt and thighs, a hump on the back of my neck like I’m the hunchback of notre dame…I went from what men I dated (mostly fit and handsome marathon runners, boxers, and soccer players) called hot to totally obesely hideous. 

I have tried pretty hard to lose weight, but after one year having my kid, I’ve only lost 2 pounds (baseline being 10 days after delivering! A time where I was making no effort, was in bed and on the couch nonstop, eating ice cream and serotonin producing not-great foods and lots of eating out).

Since then I’ve switched to home cooked meals, kale omelette nearly every breakfast, salads nearly every lunch, balanced meals every night (for example, tonight was brown rice with meatballs and zucchini), lighter and less calorie heavy snacking, before lunches and dinners often having a powder that is high fiber, high protein, high superfoods, has a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, probiotics, and some essential fatty acids in about 10 ounces of water to help me feel full before my meals and increase my general health and energy. 

I usually drink about 60 ounces of filtered water every day. I have usually one or two lattes with stevia and once in a while I’ll treat myself to a mocha without whipped cream and some cookies and pizza 1-2 times per week and a little organic red wine a few nights a week (4.5 ounces per day max) to prevent feelings of deprivation / giving up entirely.

I’ve tried different supplements, but they make little to no difference and there’s very little I can safely take while breast-feeding so I’ve given up on them, only the powder I mentioned above. They’re also loaded with heavy metals most of them, including the postnatal multivitamin I was taking (I can’t find one that has a clean test report…have you?).

I don’t count calories because those apps have never made it easy so I feel like I’m getting widely inaccurate numbers, and regardless —I’m eating pretty much the exact same as I did when I was 135lb, maybe a little more because breast-feeding has left me more hungry, but not insane amounts. Lowering calories right now lowers milk production so it’s not a good time either.

I am doing “baby-led weaning” so I’m only now feeding roughly every four hours but at night anytime my one-year-old wakes up he wants to feed on me to go back to bed. I think more than anything, it’s the disrupted sleep that has led to the hormones going crazy and just leaving me depleted, hungry, moody, unhappy, stressed, striving for energy and mental clarity constantly, and just in a constant state of disarray.

I’m almost certain I’m suffering from stuff like high cortisol. I’ve never been good at reducing my stress and I really suck at meditation (thus, kind of hate it).

I don’t want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars out of pocket with these crazy high deductible plans just to get a couple of blood tests to check things out because anytime I’ve done that in the past, my results always came out clean/totally normal… and I did all the multiple thyroid, hypothyroid tests, all of that. And what if something is off, they’re just going to prescribe medication that I can’t safely take while nursing anyway, so frankly, I don’t see the point.

I have 65 pounds to lose and at the rate of 2 pounds per year, we’re talking 33 freaking years to get back to my normal weight when I see so many other moms (I’m not talking celebrities with trainers but every day women in my direct local circle) that got their bodies back within a couple of months. Some got them back like literally right after the baby came out. It’s baffling to me how someone dealing with all these hormones can be a twig with a round belly. Anyway, I can’t wait decades, this must go faster! Anytime it goes so slow I get so discouraged that I wanna quit and then I start slipping a little with sugar.

My body seems to want to hold onto every ounce of weight/fat during nursing or something. But I believe in “attachment parenting” and can’t ever imagine cutting off my kid and that special bonding for something as superficial as weight. But I also know at this weight it’s much more serious than just appearance.

My extra weight has led to back pain, pelvic pain, foot and knee pain, shoulder pain, not wanting to be seen in public or by my own husband, etc. 
I try to walk, but my injuries and aches only allow me to do so much. I’ve had a hip injury that’s been extremely stubborn and hasn’t gone away for almost 10 years now. Pretty much the only solution seems to be surgery, which I refuse to do at such a young age, it just causes so many problems, so long story short, I can’t do high impact stuff. I get really bored with gyms and stuff so for me, I need something like sports and it’s hard to find one that is not high impact. Especially when you’re competitive. Swimming is one but that’s one that makes you hungrier due to the temperature drop (that’s why walruses, whales, and other sea animals are thicker than animals like cheetahs and horses).

I fight sugar and caffeine cravings a lot, sometimes even nicotine. In the past, I relied on caffeine a lot for an energy and mood lift and sort of an appetite suppressant. Same with v@ping and supplements to help with sugar cravings and appetite control and metabolism boosts. I also detoxed a lot to help get rid of sugar cravings (stuff like coffee enemas and infrared sauna sessions) and I did a combination of water-only fasting and intermittent fasting, and I restricted carbs but I can’t do any of that while nursing. And I wonder, was it restricting carbs that has slowed down my metabolism? Is it bad to do that long-term?

And then there is the emotional element of eating which I am leaning more on because I’m often frustrated a lot from the lack of freedom and how hard it is to take care of two young kids, and ever since pregnancy started, but especially after, it has really taken a toll on my relationship with my husband. I’m just often very angry and on edge and moody, and feel lack of emotional support which makes me feel a void and resentful toward my husband. Having kids has also increased my anxiety, which has made me more controlling, striving for a sense of order, especially so my kids get enough rest, are developed well, etc.

And I also like a lot of flavor in my foods, I was raised in a culture that uses a lot of olive oil and a lot of salt and a lot of seasoning and to have bland food feels like a sort of joyless prison.

And every psychologist/ therapist I have ever seen has just utterly failed me, I find it such a waste of time, never any results. I don’t need anyone to talk to, I just need someone who can change negative thoughts and habits and after seeing maybe a dozen therapists over the years, it’s just impossible to find someone who can actually make a noticeable difference. I even tried hypnotherapy and trauma therapy (was abused as a kid) but nope, I’m in the same boat. I feel like all they do is drain your bank account and your time.

Anyway, if any of you have faced a similar situation or have suggestions on what may work in my circumstances, is proven safe during nursing, etc. please share.

It sounds crazy, I know, because the distance part sucks. But hear me out on why I think LDR is the ultimate relationship ""pre-game.""

Why distance makes sense? Well, you date the brain first. Let's be real, when you're local, it's easy to get distracted by physical chemistry and cute dinner dates. LDR strips all that away. You have to talk. You're forced to spend hours diving into each other's heads—their dreams, their dumbest fears, how they handle conflict, and what they truly value. You get to know the soul and the personality before the body ever enters the picture. That kind of deep-dive foundation is gold.

Second, no half-assing it. When you're dealing with time zones, expensive flights, and weird scheduling, everything has to be intentional. There are no spontaneous ""Hey, wanna grab coffee?"" moments. Every call is planned, every visit is a major production. This teaches you both early on that you are worth the effort and commitment. If they're willing to go through LDR hell for you, you know they're serious.

Third, the best dates are the visit. Honestly, the anticipation for those visits is electric. Because you already know each other so well mentally, the in-person part isn't about awkward first dates; it's a massive, beautiful reunion with your best friend. It makes those first few weeks of being together feel so much more meaningful and less like a trial run.

Lastly, independence is baked in. Being long-distance means you have to maintain your own life, friends, and hobbies. When you finally close the gap, you're not instantly suffocating each other. You're blending two strong, independent lives, not two halves trying to become one whole. That's way healthier for the long run.

So yeah, LDR is a challenge, but maybe it's the best challenge to ensure a relationship is strong, honest, and built on actual connection rather than convenience. It's like a rigorous stress test that weeds out the casual flings.

Am I alone in this LDR-first preference? Wanna hear your thoughts!

Create a fast-paced, visually engaging, and creative video where the entire story is told using only 10-second clips. The goal is to challenge traditional video editing norms, entertain viewers, and inspire discussion about storytelling, creativity, and brevity.

Concept

The video is structured entirely from 10-second segments (from your footage, stock clips, or a mix).

Each clip must advance the story or joke, forcing creative transitions and pacing.

Humor, suspense, or relatability emerges from how the clips interact and flow despite the strict time limit.

Optional: add text overlays or minimal narration to enhance clarity without breaking the “10-second rule.”

Structure

Intro (0:00–0:10)

Quick hook: a dramatic, funny, or confusing clip.

Overlay text: “I made a whole video using only 10-second clips… here’s what happened.”

Narration (optional):

“Each clip you see is exactly 10 seconds long. No exceptions. Can a story still make sense?”

Setup (0:10–0:50)

Introduce the “theme” or premise of the video using several 10-second clips.

Examples: morning routine, a mini adventure, or a comedic mishap.

Keep edits tight and visually dynamic to keep attention.

Challenge Segment (0:50–2:00)

Introduce humor or tension: clips force unexpected transitions.

Example: spilling coffee → sudden 10-second clip of running late → abrupt transition to transportation.

Include exaggerated reactions or text overlay for comedic effect.

Climactic Moment (2:00–3:00)

Combine multiple 10-second clips to create a mini narrative peak.

Could be funny chaos, a surprising twist, or a relatable moment.

Overlay sound effects or minimal music to highlight pacing.

Wrap-Up (3:00–3:30)

End with a satisfying or humorous resolution within a 10-second clip.

Optional text overlay: “Can you believe this was all 10-second clips?”

Encourage viewer engagement:

“Think you could make a video like this? Comment your ideas!”

Technical Execution

Camera: Any camera or phone; focus on framing each 10-second segment cleanly.

Editing: Precision timing is key—clips must be exactly 10 seconds, transitions sharp but smooth.

Style: Fast, visually engaging, playful with creative transitions.",2,1762656100.0,ViralContentIdeaFarm,0,1.0,False

This is related to my diet, why it is the way it is. 

**I'm not forcing anyone to read or respond. You can just downvote and scroll on. Slightly TMI.**

---

For as long as I can remember, I've had severe discomfort (pain?) after consuming certain foods. I've never been able to figure out why. Doctors have never been able to figure out why. LLMs haven't been able to pinpoint why either. 

I can present the following:

- I was born with this ""disorder"". My mother says I appeared to be in visible pain as an infant each time before urinating. 
- both of my parents are vegetarian. I grew up entirely vegetarian. No meat, no fish. Definitely not vegan though. 
- I've had ultrasounds of my bladder and various other testing done as a toddler. I've seen docs and specialists throughout my teens. 
- occasionally during these flare ups, my bloodwork lightly comes back positive for a UTI. 
- after taking medication, antibiotics, self care, etc. The flare ups come back almost immediately afterwards. 
- I grew up basically assuming this was normal. I didn't understand why I would feel so uncomfortable after eating a meal with my family. About 30 mins afterwards I'd go lay down in a fetal position clutching my abdomen in pain instead of going outside to play with my friends. 
- basically every single meal I ate was vegetarian and contained one of the triggering foods (below). 
- every urologist in every state/country I've seen has said they've never even heard of my situation and brushed it off as just ""no clue, go see a psychiatrist"" and later when learning about triggers, ""just avoid those foods then bud""

For the first 17 years of my life, nobody even had any idea this was even diet related. We figured it was just some kind of recurring resistant superbug or something. 

Until one day, when I was 17... There was a fuckton of red cabbage on sale. I bought literally like 11 heads of it. Maybe more, anyway. 

I love red cabbage and each morning I'd wake up and boil a head and eat the whole thing for breakfast. I was in the worst pain of my life for the entire week and again, no idea why. 

Until I ran out of cabbage. That urinary pain and sensitivity was gone immediately. 

So I bought some more and tried again. Yep. Pain is back. That was my first indication that the ""UTIs"" I've been experiencing every week of my life was diet related. So I worked through my foods and... 

Identified the trigger list:
- spinach
- broccoli 
- brussel sprouts
- kale
- other salad greens
- asparagus 
- CABBAGE (white, red, whatever) 

Because I don't eat meat and I develop Pancreatitis if I eat fruits (long story, you can thank medical malpractice when I was 15), my only option was dairy. A diet I've been on almost exclusively since age 17. 

I will occasionally cave and eat some cabbage or salad as a treat and hate myself so much for the next 6-8hrs until the discomfort passes. 

Before you say ""oh that's easy Z, You got Interstitial cystitis""... No. Because I can eat:

- all dairy (obviously) 
- literally raw jalapeño peppers 
- raw cloves of garlic/onion
- anything super hot or spicy really 
- coffee
- artificial sweeteners in droves
- protein powder 
- soy, tofu
- tomatoes, sauces 

Etc. Anything traditionally considered a trigger for IC is delicious and not a problem for me at all. 

---

Since starting painkillers (hydromophone) I've noticed it's dulled the effects of this discomfort when eating those foods. Not eliminated, but not severe. 

I just want to be able to eat salads man. You know how hard it is to be vegetarian and to not be able to eat vegetables? 

Yes. I've asked doctors, asked in medical subreddits, asked my aunt, the librarian, the boba tea girl at my favorite cafe. Legit nobody had any idea whatsoever. I cross refd people with EDS, Lupus, PV, and other related conditions to set if they had any overlap with my problem here. None. 

I occasionally joke that a disease will be named after me, but I'm 30yrs in... with no answers and I'm not so sure that's a joke anymore.

1os7v3w,https://i.redd.it/vypkg291950g1.jpeg,My AI planned my Guizhou road trip like my car was a teleporting NPC.,"So I asked my AI co-pilot to plan our year-end self-drive trip from Jingzhou to Guizhou — six days, Xijiang Qianhu Miao Village, Kaili city, all that. The plan looked amazing: clean hotels, misty mornings, bonfire dances, logical flow… until I realized something.

He made us drive to Kaili, then magically take the bullet train back to Wuhan.

Excuse me, sir? Where exactly did the car go? Did it ascend? Was it repossessed by the mountain gods?

I literally texted him:

“We’re driving there and driving back. If we take the train, what happens to the car???”

And he went, all calm and philosophical, like:

“Ah, you’re right — that makes sense.”

Which made me laugh so hard I almost spilled my coffee.
Apparently, in his mind, cars are temporary plot devices. You use them for Act One, then they despawn.

To be fair, the rest of the plan was solid — he even picked hotels that fit my “no stilt houses, clean wooden interiors only” policy — but now I can’t stop imagining my SUV quietly dissolving in the parking lot while I ride the high-speed train back home.

10/10 for aesthetics.
0/10 for logistics.
Still taking him on the trip though. Every chaotic story needs one confused NPC.",1,1762655925.0,gpt5,1,1.0,False

TITLE: Newspaper
### Part 1
He smiled and kicked back in his chair, the two back legs teetering like skates as the sun cascaded through the dated glass above his kitchen sink. He knew it was old, but he liked it that way. He loved the way the sunlight splintered through, sending beams of light rippling through his ritualistic morning cup of orange juice. There was a newspaper on the table, but he hated them. He had nothing to do today, so he sat, enjoying the smell of over easy eggs with peppers and cheese drifting through the apartment.

It reminded him of that time Sarah and him spent the weekend at Lake Erie, breakfasts with sunrise and afternoons spent walking Atlas on the beach trying to get him to go in the water, laughing hysterically as his legs scrambled through the waves, his neck stretched out, eyes shot wide open, fur sticking out in porcupine-like spikes. They felt bad but it was a sight to see. They finished laughing and sat down on a taupe piece of driftwood, which they later used as a centerpiece for the monolithic aquarium they had in the corner of his apartment’s bedroom.

When she spent the night, Sarah loved to wake up watching the red guppies flutter about like pairs waltzing in the Grand Concourse. Every morning, when he managed to pull himself out of bed, he’d look over and see her sprinkling flakes of wonder to the fish below as they darted to the surface to feast as if their next meal wasn’t promised to them. She’d sing Amazing Grace while she did it, and after she was done, she’d turn to smile at him, a dimple beautifully nesting into her right cheek as it always did. It was during these moments that he knew he’d marry her. 

A two carat marquise was going for a touch over a grand, and he didn’t have much money but he saw the way her face lit up as they walked by jewelry store at 18th and Forbes. The Russian running the register with a face shield covered in an amalgam of silver shavings and rouge didn’t say much, scoffing as he tossed the ring on the counter next to that day’s issue. Something about a hostage situation in Jordan. Paying little mind but a fair bit of cash, he left the jewelry store sweating.

Sarah jumped into his arms as soon as he pulled the ring out, her tears forming a puddle in his collarbone. He had been all worked up for nothing, she was thrilled beyond all measure. They got married that May, the forsythia covering the knoll next to the stables on her father’s barn. He spent all his money on her ring, so they had to move in with Sarah’s parents. The wedding picture of them on her childhood tire swing sat next to pepper on his stove. The glass was cracked and it had a white fragment in the center, but he didn’t pay that any mind. He flipped the eggs and smiled at the picture.
### Part 2
He lit a Marlboro 100 and put a hand through his five-o’-clock shadow. He burnt his eggs. Too worried about the newspaper that sat on the checkered table. How did people give a damn about the European Union? He hated newspapers. He ashed his cigarette on the eggs before he washed the pan out. It was one of those woks that she insisted to wash lightly so it didn’t lose its cure. His teeth clung onto the butt like a hangover clings to your Sunday morning. He looked at the picture.

Next to that tire swing is where it happened. Sarah told him she wanted to stop taking her medication. He insisted that she keep going for just a little while longer. Sarah was screaming now, saying that he thought she was crazy. I don’t think you’re crazy. You’ve made so much progress and I don’t want to see you struggle again. Whatever.

Sarah woke up screaming and shaking. He flung himself on top of her, trying to be her safety blanket so she didn’t grab anything sharp. He looked at the amber bottle of pills sitting on her nightstand. It was almost full. He didn’t know how to do it, but she needed to get back on those pills. By noon she had calmed. She sat in the conservatory, staring out the window at a pair of cardinals, flitting about by the deck railings.

In the coming months, he had gotten Sarah back on her medication. She seemed happy, but she was always tired. Her mother had died, and it was taking a toll on her. He knew he had to get her out of that house, so he mentioned the idea of getting an apartment downtown together. Sarah agreed. She needed to get out of that house.

The apartment was the same one he was sitting in now. It was nothing to write home about, but it was enough room for them. They were hoping to start a family soon and things were going well. Sarah had found a teaching job in the South Hills, and he was pouring concrete for a company in Mount Lebanon. They were putting enough in savings to start trying. Three weeks after their two year anniversary, at the Grandview, Sarah told him she was pregnant. They sat there and laughed. They laughed for hours. He couldn’t wait. Couldn’t believe this was happening.

He finished washing the wok and looked over from the stove into the bedroom. The crib had speckled sunlight shining on it from the window above the sink. He sat down at the table and lit another cigarette. After some minutes, some ash fluttered down onto the newspaper. He hated newspapers.

### Part 3
It was twenty-two hundred the next day. Couldn’t sleep. He took another pull of Jack. He was looking at the picture, which he set on the coffee table. It still had the same crack in the glass. The same white fragment in the center. He took another pull of Jack. There was a newspaper next to the picture frame. Something about a unit in Syria. They weren’t getting it that bad. He could still see that hijab. He fucking hated newspapers. He took another pull of Jack. He put it down next to the stack of coasters they got in Erie.

He was thinking about when Sarah was flipping the top coaster through her fingers. She was nine months pregnant but real sick. I’m real sick babe. He snapped to and took a pull of Jack, then faded back. Sarah said I’m real sick. He knew her pill bottle was full. It’s not your fault love, I promise. Sarah said I can’t keep doing this. He looked at her with a confused brow. He said how can you leave me? We’re about to have a kid. I love you. Where would you even go?

The sunlight caught a flash of silver. He couldn’t catch the hammer in time. He didn’t catch it in time. He caught her before she fell off the chair. Behind him, a piece of her temple was stuck in the picture frame. Shattered the glass. Red. He snapped to, Jack, faded back. Her left eye was on the newspaper on the coffee table. He fucking hated newspapers. Why is your pill bottle full? Sarah’s eye on the newspaper was watching him. He fucking hated newspapers. Why didn’t you catch the hammer? Those guys in Syria weren’t getting it that bad. 

He came to, and took a pull of Jack. He put one through his left femur, but this time he didn’t want to catch the hammer. That’s for not catching it in time. It’s your fault. He took the newspaper out of the box, still had the stain on it. He fucking hated newspapers. Jack. If you were faster you would’ve caught the hammer. You should’ve kept the thirty eight locked. You insisted on having it. Should’ve kept it locked. Your fault. 

He knew she was sick, he could have put the meds in her food or something. He should’ve it was his fault. One through the right femur. This time he didn’t want to catch the hammer. That’s for not putting the meds in her food. He looked over at the crib. No sunlight. He took the fragment out of the picture frame and looked at it. The glass fell loose. Red. You should’ve put the meds in her food. Your fault. This time he didn’t wan’t to catch the hammer.",1,1762655810.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

## How to Choose the Perfect Coffee Gift

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=gifts%20for%20coffee%20lovers)

Before we dive into the goodies, take a second to think about your coffee lover. What's their current setup?

*   **The Beginner:** Maybe they use a basic drip machine or instant coffee. Gifts that introduce them to new brewing methods are perfect.
*   **The Enthusiast:** They already have a favorite brewing method (like a French press or pour-over). Think upgrades and accessories.
*   **The Connoisseur:** This person talks about single-origin beans, flavor notes, and bloom time. They'll appreciate high-end gear and rare coffee finds.
*   **The On-the-Go Drinker:** Their mantra is ""coffee to-go."" Their world revolves around a good travel mug and convenient options.

## For the Home Barista: Brewing Equipment & Upgrades

This is for the person who loves the process as much as the product. They're ready to level up their home coffee game.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=gifts%20for%20coffee%20lovers)

### **1. A High-Quality Burr Grinder**
*This is the single most important upgrade a coffee lover can make.* A burr grinder (vs. a cheaper blade grinder) provides a consistent grind size, which is essential for a balanced and flavorful extraction. It's the difference between a good cup and a *great* cup. Brands like **Baratza** and **Breville** make fantastic entry-level and prosumer models.

### **2. A Gooseneck Electric Kettle**
For anyone into pour-over coffee (like a V60 or Chemex), a gooseneck kettle is non-negotiable. It offers the precision and control needed to evenly saturate the grounds. An electric model that keeps the water at a precise temperature is a game-changer. Check out the **Fellow Stagg EKG**—it's a work of art and a powerhouse tool.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=gifts%20for%20coffee%20lovers)

### **3. The AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker**
The AeroPress is a cult favorite for a reason. It's incredibly versatile, durable, and easy to clean. It can make everything from a smooth, clean cup of coffee to a concentrated espresso-like shot for lattes. It's also portable and budget-friendly, making it one of the best all-around **gifts for coffee lovers**.

### **4. A Digital Kitchen Scale**
Coffee brewing is a science. A good digital scale that measures to the 0.1 gram is crucial for consistency. The **Hario V60 Drip Scale** is a barista staple, complete with a built-in timer to help them nail their pour-over technique every time.

## For the Connoisseur: Beans, Subscriptions & Accessories

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=gifts%20for%20coffee%20lovers)

This person appreciates the finer things. Their focus is on the quality and origin of the coffee itself.

### **5. A High-End Coffee Subscription Box**
This is the gift that keeps on giving. A subscription service from a top-tier roaster (like **Atlas Coffee Club** or **Trade Coffee**) delivers fresh, single-origin beans to their door every month. It's a fantastic way for them to explore the world of coffee without leaving the house. You can often tailor the subscription to their preferred roast level or taste profile.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=gifts%20for%20coffee%20lovers)

### **6. A Set of Professional Tasting Cups**
Help them taste like a pro with a set of standardized coffee tasting cups. These are designed to highlight the aroma and subtle flavor notes of different coffees. They look sleek and make the whole coffee-tasting experience feel more official.

### **7. Coffee Bean Storage Canisters**
Air, light, and moisture are the enemies of fresh coffee. A set of airtight, opaque canisters (like those from **Fellow** or **Airscape**) will keep their precious beans fresh and flavorful for much longer. It’s a practical and stylish addition to their countertop.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=gifts%20for%20coffee%20lovers)

For the commuter, the traveler, or the parent who needs their caffeine fix *now*.

### **8. A High-Performance Insulated Tumbler**
Not all travel mugs are created equal. A high-quality insulated tumbler from a brand like **Stanley** or **Zojirushi** will keep their coffee piping hot for hours on end. Look for one with a leak-proof lid and a design that fits in a car's cup holder.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=gifts%20for%20coffee%20lovers)

### **9. A Portable Coffee Maker**
For the ultimate adventurer, a portable, non-electric coffee maker is a revolutionary gift. The **Wacaco Nanopresso** is a compact, manual espresso maker that produces a surprisingly authentic shot with just a few pumps. Perfect for camping, hiking, or just ensuring they never have to drink bad hotel coffee again.

### **10. Instant Coffee Sachets (The Good Kind!)**
Yes, good instant coffee exists. Specialty brands now offer freeze-dried coffee that preserves the complex flavors of the original brew. Brands like **Sudden Coffee** or **Voilà** provide individually wrapped sachets that are a lifesaver for a quick, quality cup anywhere.

Sometimes the best gifts are the ones that add comfort and personality to their coffee routine.

For the latte and cappuccino lover who doesn't want a full-blown espresso machine, a handheld or automatic electric milk frother is a perfect, affordable gift. It can turn any regular coffee into a fancy, café-style drink in seconds.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=gifts%20for%20coffee%20lovers)

### **12. A Beautiful Mug (from a Potter)**
I know, I said no generic mugs. But a handmade, unique ceramic mug from a local artisan or on Etsy is a completely different story. It's a one-of-a-kind piece that supports a small business and adds a personal touch they'll appreciate every morning.

### **13. Coffee-Flavored Treats**
Think outside the mug! Gourmet coffee-infused syrups, coffee rubs for grilling, chocolate-covered espresso beans, or even coffee-scented candles can be a fun and delicious way to celebrate their favorite flavor.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=gifts%20for%20coffee%20lovers)

### **14. A Barista-Style Apron**
If they're often making a mess while experimenting with new recipes, a stylish, durable apron is a thoughtful and practical gift. It protects their clothes and makes them feel like a true pro.

### **15. A Coffee-Themed Book**
From the history of coffee to a deep-dive guide on brewing techniques, a beautiful coffee table book or an educational manual is a great gift for someone who loves to learn about their obsession.

1os7qot,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/1os7qot/i_prefer_ldr_first_irl_later/,"I prefer ldr first, irl later.","I wanna start a relationship long-distance before ever getting to the in-person stage. Like, seriously.

It sounds crazy, I know, because the distance part sucks. But hear me out on why I think LDR is the ultimate relationship ""pre-game.""

Why distance makes sense? Well, you date the brain first. Let's be real, when you're local, it's easy to get distracted by physical chemistry and cute dinner dates. LDR strips all that away. You have to talk. You're forced to spend hours diving into each other's heads—their dreams, their dumbest fears, how they handle conflict, and what they truly value. You get to know the soul and the personality before the body ever enters the picture. That kind of deep-dive foundation is gold.

Second, no half-assing it. When you're dealing with time zones, expensive flights, and weird scheduling, everything has to be intentional. There are no spontaneous ""Hey, wanna grab coffee?"" moments. Every call is planned, every visit is a major production. This teaches you both early on that you are worth the effort and commitment. If they're willing to go through LDR hell for you, you know they're serious.

Third, the best dates are the visit. Honestly, the anticipation for those visits is electric. Because you already know each other so well mentally, the in-person part isn't about awkward first dates; it's a massive, beautiful reunion with your best friend. It makes those first few weeks of being together feel so much more meaningful and less like a trial run.

Lastly, independence is baked in. Being long-distance means you have to maintain your own life, friends, and hobbies. When you finally close the gap, you're not instantly suffocating each other. You're blending two strong, independent lives, not two halves trying to become one whole. That's way healthier for the long run.

So yeah, LDR is a challenge, but maybe it's the best challenge to ensure a relationship is strong, honest, and built on actual connection rather than convenience. It's like a rigorous stress test that weeds out the casual flings.

Am I alone in this LDR-first preference? Wanna hear your thoughts!

Why did you do this? 

I had a fuckton of fun last year searching around for my ideal latte - heavily spiced and aromatic with pepper. I want caffeinated soup.

Learn anything?

I want to get ballsy enough to ask Ugly Duck and Happy Gut to mix their pumpkin syrup and habanero syrups in a latte for me. I know what to look for next year after two years of raw data, so I can write out all the places I missed and prioritize them for next year.

Are you okay?

Pfft, hell no, but I like exploring, I just need a goal to give me that extra push. This is the only flavored drink I seek out annually. I'm usually happy with a dirty chai or black coffee at home. My wallet will be a lot happier in a bit.",45,1762655498.0,Rochester,2,0.96,False
1os7pbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Perspective2Lessons/comments/1os7pbx/battle_scars_and_bliss/,Battle Scars and Bliss,"My self-love is pure and sweet, and as funny as it can be, for it runs deep. I do not care if people call it selfish; that kind of judgment often says more about them than it does about me.

Society might tell me it's not okay to be picky, but I know that selectivity demands consistency. Love and care are what make a relationship last, and if I don't have that for myself, how can I give it to someone else?

I gave years of my life—from my late twenties into my early thirties—to a first-everything relationship that became my greatest lesson. When it ended, I almost broke, but my foundation held. I returned, stronger, to the woman I had built before it began. It was a homecoming I will never regret.

Sure, it sucks when my mind plays tricks, whispering that contentment will cost me connection. When that happens, I reflect it back: my mystery person will be someone who knows their own shadows and their own light. They will have done their work so that they can meet me in the middle—in the sacred overlap of our Venn diagrams.

Until then, I'm just going to be. 
I will still be me.
And if they don't like it? 
They can go find less😘🍂 

Oh, the wonderful dates I have by myself. I adventure on my own two feet, dining alone in a crowded place, simply enjoying the music and the distant laughter of groups in their own space. In these moments, I feel a deep contentment, savoring this unfiltered, unbiased time with myself over a sandwich and sweet potato fries.

I smile at the waitress as she comes near. She asks if I would like tiramisu tonight, reading the flash in my eyes and my nod. She returns with a plate for one. The dessert is a perfect little tower, dusted in cocoa. I take the first bite—the cool, creamy mascarpone giving way to the soft, coffee-soaked ladyfingers. As it melts on my tongue, I observe the movements, breathe in the smells, and feel the emotions all around me, as contentment and pure bliss come raining down.

I leave the café for a long walk. The cool autumn air is sharp and clean in my lungs, carrying the scent of damp earth and crumbling leaves. Sunlight, golden and low, filters through the branches, setting the canopy of red and gold ablaze. With every step, the crisp leaves crunch satisfyingly under my artsy shoes, a rhythm for my wandering thoughts.

It is not all rainbows and sunshine. It is the active, daily practice of my love—the decision to nurture myself, to dust myself off, and to rise with conviction from every stumble and fall. These are not just messes; they are the battle scars that prove I am always fighting for myself, and I am always winning my way back.

Like the other day, I fell and scraped my knees. A tear dropped onto my cheek, but a soft thought of persevering compelled me to stand tall, my chin raised higher than Mount Everest's peak. I walked away with a merciful compass, guiding my own care.

I love myself enough to know what I need to wear to anchor and advocate for my spirit. People ask what my secret is, and I tell them the truth:

Knowing my own light and my own shadow is how I learn to fully love and accept this self. I am the only one who lives this life from within. So I will learn to understand myself, wholeheartedly, again and again.

1os7o8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/pppdizziness/comments/1os7o8c/pppd/,PPPD?,"I know no one here can diagnose but hoping to find anyone whose had a similar experience here to mine because I’m not sure if the PPPD path is what I should explore with the doctors and I’m desperate and also need to vent because I feel like this is going to implode my life. 

I’m barely able to work. I’m grateful I work remote but it’s gotten to the point where half the day I’m crying in front of the monitor scared to death that I have some terrible disease lurking that doctors aren’t finding.  I’ve cancelled all my social plans. I feel really hopeless. 

On 9/29 in I flew home from Denver. On 10/1 while working (computer/desk work) I felt this sensation come over my head, like doing a strong whip it, sucking in helium or having a tuning fork in it. I thought I was having a stroke. It was only a few seconds but I got tunnel vision. 

Immediately after I experienced disequilibrium, which I’ve had for 38 days since. There was no vertigo/spinning. It just like gravity pull, feeling like I was on a raft type thing, off gait and extremely light headed more often than not. 

I feel mildly better when I’m walking oddly but laying/sitting is rough. I’ve identified “triggers” that make it much worse- work unfortunately is one, the screen itself and I assume the stress. Midway and immediately after eating it’s bad. Loud noises. Busy places. There’s a fullness in my head almost constantly. I’ve had two more episodes similar to 10/1 as well throughout this time that were really intense and feel like all of the blood and oxygen are draining from my head for a few seconds. 

I have an SVT that’s been dormant for over a year. I had one significant episode in my life in Jan 2024 but two days after this started I had another episode. I also had another SVT on 10/16. But my HR was normal all day the day the dizziness began beforehand. About two weeks into this I developed non-stop tinnitus which I’ve never had before either. For about a week I had significant pressure at the base of my skull into my neck when I would lay down but that mostly subsided. I have difficulty focusing my vision and have a left eye tremor/twitch going on. 

Since this started I’ve been to the PCP twice who said it was probably related to my SVT. I went to the cardiologist who said it was probably an ear issue. I went to an ENT who did the pike maneuver only and said it wasn’t the ear and if it was it would’ve shown on an mri I had back in May? He recommended nuero. I went to eye dr and he said eyes look fine. I went to urgent care who also recommended nuero. Went to ER, had head CT (no contrast), chest CTA and neck CT. They didn’t find anything related to the ear. I went to the neurologist who also dismissed it because my CT was clear. I had multiple rounds of bloodwork throughout the month of Oct and could see a slow spike throughout of a possible infection (WBC/Neutrophils elevated) but they said it was likely due to “anxiety”. My phosphorus was low at the hospital no clue why so they gave me a supplement and sent me on my way. I read that could cause dizziness so I was hopeful this was the solution but fortunately it is at normal range now but unfortunately I’m still off. 

I read that SSRIs can help with this imbalance so I started Prozac a few weeks ago. I tried testing my glucose for days and BP to see if it was hypoglycemia. I switched to eating 5-6 whole food healthy meals and snacks day which made it worse. I stopped drinking coffee. I’m forcing myself to go places even if I vomit in the public restrooms. I’m taking vitamin b12 and D. I’ve been on a 30 day heart monitor since the 22nd but no calls of any issues. 

I had Covid in August and I suffer with chronic illness since I was a kid but this is the straw that’s breaking the camels back after two years of dealing with other ailments and doctors for unrelated issues I’m so burnt out on the doctors appointments and being dismissed as is. 

I read that PPPD is where it’s worse upright so I don’t know if this is it since I feel better standing. Not 100% but def better than sitting or laying down. Im just loosing my mind.

“That might be a problem. I want two.” Dan said. 

Amy looks at him, “don’t you dare toy with me Mr, I have been trying to work up the courage since Saturday morning to talk about this! If you think you’re being funny your not. I will walk out of this house and out of your life for fucking ever!”

Dan says, “Come here and holds his arms open.”

“Talk to me Dan. I’m not buying this.  Two kids that’s a bullshit answer.”

“Come here and let me explain. Okay?”

“ This is going to take a lot of explaining.” Amy said as she slid into the bed. Her bull shit radar on high alert.  

“Since Tracy passed I’ve had a lot of time to think about being alone versus in a relationship. After a lot of soul searching I decided I wanted someone in my life. With a person my age there would be a lot of baggage. Family, financial, emotional even sexual. Not saying for a high value individual that it wouldn’t be worth it. Problem is I’m picky. Just not any pretty face would do.”

Amy shook her head in understanding. Dan continued. 

“When I thought about someone younger, there is still baggage. Hopefully not as much but still things to unpack. So a high value woman, someone I want in my life for the next 30 or 40 years might very well love my family but wants one of her own.”

Amy starts to speak but stops and sits in silence. 

“I struggled with that for a long time. Am I to old for this? Then one day it dawns on me.  It’s not my decision. If someone loves me enough to want to have an old man’s baby when they can’t get all assets, would mean they are serious. I have legal documents protecting everything and everyone even the baby.  I also think is very important for a child to have a sibling.”  

Amy buries her face in Dan’s shoulder. The tears flow. Tears of relief, tears of joy, tears of appreciation for a man in her life that steadies the ship. 

“Your original answer caught me off guard.”

“There is so much to unpack with this. But yes I would like a second go at fatherhood.”

They cuddle together and once again everything seems right with the world. 

The five o’clock alarm goes off. Putting an end to Sunday afternoon sex. They hurry up and get ready to go to Rachel and Ben’s. 

It was a great evening of food, fun and nonsense. At 7:30 it was time for the little people to get ready for bed. So Dan, Amy and Kayla headed home. Dan went right away to do the few evening chores. Mean while Amy talked to Kayla who was packing to 
head back to college. 

“So you and Dad. Is it a real thing or just a fun time?” Kayla asks but not sure she wants to know the answer. 

“Oh it’s real. It might even be realer than I ever imagined.” Amy can’t help but smile. 

“Good. I think you would be a great step mom!” Kayla says, going in for a hug. 

Those words hit Amy right in the heart. She can’t help but to start crying. Which makes Kayla start crying. They hug as Dan walks in. He doesn’t say a word. Just throws his arms around the two of them.  Kisses each one top of the head and turns around and leaves. 

They all say their goodbyes and watch Kayla head down the lane and onto the road. 

“Fire pit time.” Dan says. 

“You asking or telling me?” Amy asks. 

“Tonight is telling.  We just announced to the world today that we are together. Half the state knows about us by now. We need to talk about the real world and how we navigate it. Steve even got a call asking what the hell his Dad was thinking chasing a 30 year old woman.”

The color washed out of Amy’s face. “What did he say?”

Dan laughed. He told them, “Shit! He’s to old to chase. He just sits back and waits for them to come to him.”

Amy laughed as they walked to the fire pit hand in hand. 

XOXOXO

The alarm went off at 5:30. Dan went to make coffee while Amy hopped in the shower. In a few minutes Dan walks into the bathroom with two cups of coffee and opens the shower door. Just standing there smiling. 

“Is one of the coffees for me?” Amy asks. 

“Nope.” Taking a sip. 

“Why are you in here then?” More than a little annoyed. 

 “I think you know why.” Taking another sip of coffee. 

“Explain it to me. It’s Monday and I haven’t had coffee yet.”

Dan takes a sip of coffee. “See I have this smoking hot girlfriend that looks delicious when she is in the shower naked and all soapy.” Takes another sip of coffee, smiles and sets them on the counter.  Drops his shorts and steps into the shower. 

“What are you doing! I’m going to be late for work.”

“I’ll call your boss and let him know.” Amy rolls her eyes at him. As she is pulled in close. She knows this one isn’t going to be slow and seductive. This is a man who has one thing on his mind.  They share a deep kiss as his one hand cups her ass and the other starts rubbing her kitty.  He is rubbing hard and fast trying to make her cum so he can use her. Knowing what will push her over the edge, he leans over and sucks a nipple and piercing into his mouth. Slowly her lips are parted and a finger slips in and starts messaging her G spot. 

Amy begins to gush as she moans “Fuck, your getting good at that!” The next thing she knows she is bent over at the waist. 

The Silver Fox slowly slides his cock into her beautiful kitty and starts pumping in and out. “I need you Baby Girl. This wasn’t planned but I saw you here naked and beautiful in the shower.” Amy moans as she can feel it building. 

“I couldn’t resist this body.” Dan could feel his cock enlarge. 

“Come with me Daddy!” Is all it took. As ropes of cum filled her pussy.

 “Oh fuck.” Amy moans. Pushing her ass back into Dan. Wanting all of him in her. 

They stood there holding each other under the shower as they came down. Then sharing a soft kiss.

Lots of the time I really tell myself I won’t let it happen again but it’ll be I treat myself to do a bit of grapefruit pulp in my tea and then some coconut jelly and then it just spirals. It also don’t help that it is PANFIULLY convenient and almost enjoyable to purge in the disabled bathroom.

I know I should stop. It’s ridiculous and stupid does anyone have advice? I try to keep myself occupied with games and stuff and taking extra care of the store but I haven’t managed to gone one shift without purging.

I rarley use milk, no tea or coffee just protein shakes and the occasional bowl of cereal. Last night I had a bowl of cereal and noticed we only had one carton of milk left in the fridge and it was only about 1/3 full. I wondered when my mum was going to buy some more and if I should go out tomorrow and buy some. 

Fast forward to the day after (today) - around 5pm I choose to have another bowl of cereal, I notice no one has got new milk and it’s the same carton of milk from yesterday, this time even less full, I feel the weight of it, I look for more milk in the fridge and there is none, I take special note of this in my head because my mum n her boyfriend drink so much tea + coffee they would be very annoyed if I used the last of it. The cereal took priority anyway haha so I used a little bit and left a tiny bit left in there (maybe enough for one drink) 

Skip forward 2 hours, my mum n her boyfriend have been taking a nap this whole time n haven’t been awake long, I go back in the fridge whilst my mum is in the kitchen and notice 2 full cartons of milk (one opened, one not) , I say oh you went shopping huh when did you do that? This morning she says. She says they have been here since the morning and I explain to her how that’s impossible because of all of the above (my whole moral dilemma around using the last of the milk) - she swears by it, she is not lying and there is no reasonable time where they could of snuck out to buy it as they were asleep. 

There is no reasonable that makes sense, I have no carbon monoxide poisoning (well I don’t show any other signs lol) and I know what I saw, felt, thought about. I am well informed on string theory, shifting, a lot of things spiritual so my first thought was this sub and shifting, what do u think?

Adèle was in a hallway, but it was unlike any she had ever seen. The walls were made of a material that looked like polished, dark wood, yet it swirled with faint, internal luminescent patterns, like a nebula trapped in varnish. The floor was soft, carpeted in a deep, plush material that muffled her footsteps completely.
Whoa, Adèle thought, her mind struggling to catch up. Can I even get a breakfast in this place?
She’d been picturing a creaky staircase, a communal dining room with mismatched chairs, maybe a kettle and some instant coffee. Where are the lovely pensioner women, the kind who crowd and make warm places like this, even though they're threadbare? The ones who would offer you a biscuit and ask about your studies?
This place... it was silent. Spotless. Perfect. There wasn't a speck of dust, not a single scuff mark on the wall. Like, is this some thing the super rich do or have? Some level of existence so sublime she couldn't even comprehend it?
It wasn't ""spooky"" in the way of cobwebs or creaking floors. It was the opposite. It was a terrifying, absolute, sterile perfection. She almost felt like turning around to push open the door she'd come through, to find and touch reality again—even the cold, dark gravel path felt more real than this.
This felt like she slipped into some place she was not privileged to have access to, like a normal person accidentally wandering into a billionaire's secret, futuristic vault. She half-expected another chime, another digital voice telling her ""Error: Occupancy not authorized.""
But the hallway was silent, offering only a choice: left or right.

She drifted down the hall, each step a conscious effort. This place wasn't just new; it was ancient. The mansion was perfect in every detail.
She passed a towering bookcase, the dark wood polished to a mirror finish. The books themselves, bound in aged leather, seemed to hum with potential. Even the chairs set in small alcoves cried out their history and provenance; she could almost see the hands that had carved the intricate legs, the forgotten inspirations that led to their design.
It was both solid—the weight of centuries pressed into every object—and dizzying. She felt small, a piece of temporary dust in a permanent gallery.
But the awe was secondary to the crushing exhaustion. She reached the end of the hall and looked up. A grand staircase, carpeted in the same silent, plush material, curved up into the darkness. She put a hand on the bannister to steady herself.
She just hoped her legs had enough strength to climb up and find a room. All she wanted was to collapse upon a bed and let the strangeness of this place fade to black.

Advice that is good, easy to follow, backed by common sense, evidenced by examples both good and bad. There is no shortage of such advice on this planet. There are enough experienced people, books, videos, and even laws meant to help people avoid the path of folly.**

**But people still don’t get it and it could be frustrating. Isn’t it so simple just to follow time tested advice and instruction to make life better? Instead, humans of all ages — including me!! — are known to exhibit such numbing of the mind. What could be some of the underlying factors contributing to this behavior? I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this, and I believe these three reasons explain this strange, stubborn habit of the human mind.**

1. **The Brain is a Creature of Habit (and a Master Rationalizer)**

Growing up, when we first disregard an instruction and get into trouble, our brain goes into **self-defense mode**. It explains to itself that

a) “You were innocent”

b) “You didn’t mean to cause trouble”

c) “Not everything is lost and nothing bad has really happened.”

d) “There is always a way to recover it later, or the loss did not matter much.”

This self-defense mechanism of our brain is actually well designed or else we would for ever live in remorse and regret. However, when this trait of our brain is repeatedly abused or misused to rationalize disregard for instructions, it forms a pattern over a period of time — **a dangerous pattern of ignoring advice and then rationalizing it**. And, our brains love to form patterns, habits and routines!

**How to Break the Pattern?**

Such patterns eventually exhibit themselves in passive aggressive behaviors where people find it very difficult to ingest advice or instructions into their minds and implement it. How do we prevent or undo such patterns? There are many ways of preventing or breaking such patterns and I propose only a couple here.

**For younger Minds:**

Parents and guardians need to clearly, gently and firmly explain that while the disregard did not cause a great material loss, it is indeed a transgression of the mind. They need to leverage the fact that the brain is a creature of habit and make it a pattern in the young minds to value advice and instruction irrespective of the potential loss ignoring it may cause.

**For adults:**

We need to recognize the nature of the brain and consciously make changes to our decision making processes. It is necessary to pause and heed to prevailing advice relevant to the decision at hand and incorporate it as one of the deciding factors. When this is done consistently it will result in **reprogramming the brain** to be sensitive to advice and exhortation rather than growing numb to it.

**2. The Thrill of Adventure vs. The Lure of Folly**

A great many places have been discovered, innovations have been made, treasures found, and lost cultures revived by people seeking adventure. By challenging the norms. By venturing beyond the set boundaries into the unknown. It’s an innate quality of every human to wonder what is unknown and go after it. That is essential for progress.

However the flip side of it is also equally dangerous.

When warned not to touch a live wire, you don’t want to wonder how it would feel to be electrocuted and actually try it! Same goes with warnings about not getting too close to the edge of a cliff, aggressive driving, reckless relationships, substance abuse and violating moral codes in the **name of adventure and excitement**.

When people venture out against these boundaries in the name of thrill and adventure, the results are there for everyone to see — lost lives, broken relationships, moral bankruptcy to name a few. The thrill of adventure needs to be leveraged for good — not to the detriment of our bright future!

**3. The Lure of the Successful Rebel**

Advertisements, advertisements, advertisements! Forget the media advertisements for a moment. I’m talking about the advertising done by **people who have been there and done that!** Your friends, relatives, colleagues, or a stranger at the coffee shop — if any of them has gone down the path of a rebel and disregarded any of the social, moral, legal and medical boundaries and lived to tell a story… boy! That is one heck of a narrative.

Simply stated, the story of a rebel who narrates it as a **success** is way more powerful than the one narrated as a lesson to be learnt. There’s nothing wrong with listening to personal stories — they are powerful and true — but we must choose wisely!

Choose what you let into your ears, and mind and eventually, your heart.
