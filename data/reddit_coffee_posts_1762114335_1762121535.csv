There were some people that were surpised, some people that were generally happy. However after I kept on asking for the lottery numbers, on the 2nd time they literally kicked me out.

By this I mean, it was like as they were talking, I started asking, one person said ""It is you again"" and the other person said something like enough of this, and then it was like the connection scattered.

My other experiences with mind reading was, I thought this person an an eatery was a different name, and I was trying to think of her right name. That person then walked by me and said super loud ""Who the heck is (the name I thought of, but not the right name)""

She said it mockingly too.

Another incident was, one day while working I imagined two coworkers boxing one another.  After some minutes, in real life, the co worker called out to me, and then I looked over and he play fought the other co worker who I ironically imagined he was boxing.

 He then said ""Isn't this what you wanted to see?"" with a smirk. 

A last incident I want to mention was that at my old job, the sugar/straw/cup container somehow has the word ""Mind Reading"" across it. It does not relate to my job at all, as we work with guns, drones, aerospace.

While I was there getting coffee, this lady walked by me, and at this time, I was having intrusive thoughts calling her ""Sup lady"" mulitple times. On the last time, my intrusive thought went something like ""Would you respond to me if I called you an old lady?""

She immedately stopped and asked what did I say?

I didn't say anything, it was all in my mind, intrusive thoughts. Then she flashed an evil grin and walked away.

If people can actually mind read on such a level, then I do suppose missing bodies would be found much easier if the culprit is already caught up versus a different method of inputting thoughts first, then just guessing based on the frequency that inputted the thought into your head.

1omud8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1omud8g/frustrated_lifestyle_conflicts/,Frustrated Lifestyle Conflicts,"Okay, I really do like my roommates (23F and 23F, I am 24F), they are great people, and we get along well as friends. However, we do have very different boundaries and lifestyles, which have been making it very uncomfortable and stressful for me. I moved across the country to a city where I didn’t know anyone for grad school and met my roommates on the school Facebook (we all study the same subject but different programs). We didn’t communicate much before moving in together; we were all a little desperate to just find housing and figure it out later. When I moved in, I found out they are both pretty avid weed smokers (every day), which is fine, you do you, I smoke every once and a while, but definitely not every day. I was kind of taken aback that this never came up before we signed our lease, and I probably would have preferred to live somewhere smoke-free because I have some breathing issues and it’s just not really my thing. Another thing I wasn’t aware of is that one of my roommates stays up very late (like 5/7 am) and does most of her work during the night, then prefers to sleep most of the day (until 3 pm-ish), which is something else I was surprised about because she agreed when I talked about being a morning person but we have different rooms and to each their own. We also never really developed apartment boundaries, when I brought it up, it was quickly brushed aside, and I didn’t want to push it because they definitely have the chill, go with the flow vibe. 

For the first stretch of living together, it was fine, they are super friendly, and I was excited to live with people who I can hang out with. However, I definitely have a cleaner lifestyle than they have and also facilitate all the practical elements of the apartment, like communicating with the landlord for everything from replacing lightbulbs to clarifying rent, and I am paying for utilities (which we then split). They always would say thank you and jokingly call me the mom of the apartment. We also all split getting different things for the apartment, furniture, dishes, cleaning supplies, and we trade off getting essentials like toilet paper, trash bags, etc, so that is not too much of an issue. Since I moved across the country and they both drove from home to move in, they brought the bulkier furniture, and I bought a new set of dishes and utensils, and decorations. 

I usually take a few hours every other week to clean the apartment, bathroom, floors, kitchen, etc, which is fine but a bit frustrating because it’s not really reciprocated. The dishes are something that stresses me out because one of the roommates will leave all her dishes in the sink to the point that the sink doesn’t drain and is difficult to use. Usually, at this point, I’ll crack and do them because if I’m cooking, I need to be able to use the sink, and we only have two sinks in the apartment (kitchen and bathroom), and I want to be able to fill the water filter or wash my hands. She will do all her dishes during the night after a few days (which usually wakes me up because she will do her dishes at 2-4 am), but rarely puts them away after washing them, so I will usually do that. She also will leave any dish she didn’t use in the sink, ex, if I leave a fork in the sink, she will leave it after putting away all the pots and plates she used. I was fine with doing that and not bringing it up because I’ve had a few really bad roommate situations in the past, and I’m at the point where I don’t think confrontation is worth it. I also didn’t really know anyone other than them, so I was willing to put it aside so I wouldn’t impact the friendship or make them think I’m a stickler.

One of the main issues is guests. In the beginning, after we had just moved, there weren’t too many people coming over. I tried to talk to them about communicating when people are over, but again was brushed aside and not something I pushed. They had people over occasionally and not too many overnight guests, maybe once a month. I had some friends eventually fly over to visit me, which was great. They stayed on the pullout couch in the living room, and they all said my late-night roommate woke them up to do her laundry/ dishes, which I felt bad about and made me uncomfortable offering to host my friends because I didn’t want to put them in those situations, and also wanted to be able to respect my roommates’ operating hours. Since then, I don’t really have people over, and when I do give a heads up. 

My roommates have guests over quite frequently, and after a few months living together, it became very frequent. There were three months when there were people sleeping on the couch in the living room every week for my late-night roommate. Which honestly made me really uncomfortable and anxious because I would come out of my room to make breakfast (we are in a tiny apartment where the couch is a few feet from the kitchen/ laundry machine, all that), and a stranger who I wasn’t aware was there would start up small talk while I was trying to get my coffee.  I’m a very friendly person, but not really in the morning, so this stressed me out because I wouldn’t want to be rude to my roommate’s friend, but I also just don’t always have the social capacity to be chatting with people I don’t know. She also frequently leaves her guests alone at the apartment during the day or sleeps through the day, leaving them alone. During the weekend, this is usually fine, but during the week, when I need to work, it’s more noise to deal with, and sometimes they also work remotely and will work out of the apartment in shared spaces. She also doesn’t really clean up after her friends, and they are mostly not the neatest people, which I get because they are on vacation doing their thing, but when there is someone visiting every week, it gets exhausting and difficult to keep things organized. 

This year has been pretty difficult because I’ve been working at home, I teach a few classes online, and while we have a shared extra room, it is usually very messy, and I don’t want to move my roommates’ stuff around to use it. Also, my late-night roommate will wake up around 12-3 pm when I’m working and very loudly make coffee and watch TV, which distracts me quite a bit when I’m trying to lecture or run a meeting (this is after I already made a comment asking her to be a bit quieter while I'm in meetings). There are also frequently people over with no heads up, which kind of stresses me out because I’ll come home after a long day, and there are people I don’t know on the couch, and I feel a bit too drained to be my usual friendly self because I just want to make some food and crash to recharge. 

I do feel quite lonely and frustrated where I am at, and on top of a pretty stressful job and school schedule, my roommates have definitely been impacting my sleep schedule and how much I’m eating because sometimes I’m too drained to cook while someone I don’t know watches me. I also feel stuck and like I don’t have anywhere to go because everyone I know is across the country, and unlike my roommates, I can’t go home for a weekend or have my parents drop food off for me, I also don't have my social network here so I don't have a place I'd feel comfortable asking to crash at. 

I have spent a lot of time being stressed by this and am not sure of what to do. Ideally, I’d move out and find a single apartment; however, I can’t afford a single where I’m living, and the idea of trying to find a better roommate situation or do the whole sublease thing seems more trouble than it’s worth. Again, I really do like my roommates; we hang out, and I have nothing against them as people, but we just aren’t compatible roommates, and this strains our friendship because I don’t trust them fully or feel like I could depend on them. Another solution would be bringing all this up to them, which I think they would take pretty well, but these things are mostly lifestyle preferences, and I don’t want to be too sensitive or a stickler or act like someone’s mom telling them they need to do the dishes or ask to have people over. For me, it seems a bit like basic adulting and consideration, but also can’t apply personal assumptions to other people. I think I’ll probably just keep at therapy to manage my anxiety and make it through the rest of the lease (\~9 months).",1,1762121134.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

When I make it on my Aeropress, I get a very nice mellow cup with a lot of black tea coming through, just pleasant and very drinkable. On the other hand a V60 gets me maybe a cleaner texture, but a more of a astringent taste with a less pleasant acidity and more bitterness even. It's like the V60 is brighter, but way too much. This is quite annoying since I enjoy brewing with the V60 way more and would also expect opposite results. What do you think I could improve with my V60 to get better cups?

Some more details:

Travel Aeropress: 12.5g coffee, 200 water, normal (non-invderted) method, all water poured at once, then add plunger, swirl at 2:30, plunge at 3:00
- Grind size - 18 clicks on Timemore C2

V60: 15g coffee, 250 water, 45g bloom, start second pour (all remaining water) at 0:45 - brew times around 2:15 
- Grind size 22 clicks on C2

And my theories:

- The unbleached V60 paper (box, 40 count) sucks in some way
- Fines from Timemore C2 making more of a difference in the V60 (although there should be less of them in the coarser grind)
- Dose difference - but ratio is about the same so idk
- Grind size - should I go even coarser and aim for faster brew times on the v60?-
- My inaccurate expectations from the two brewers - am I expecting different cups from the V60 than it can provide?
- Water composition - I usually make the V60 at home, while the Aeropress other places - so maybe it's the water? (in both cases it's filtered with a Brita-style filter)
- Technique - I'm something messing up with the V60 and getting a uneven extraction. (After all grinds are wetted I do smaller circles around the middle from not very high up and try to stay beteen 6-9g/s)

Part I, The ambush

we were on the railroad, it was a dirty job, but it was the same as every damn morning. wake up before the birds, before the rooster crows, get to work too early, nothing more to me than my tattered work clothes, chew, and a mug of coffee that wont last past 7. we started the same as normal, drilling spikes into the ground, the big impacts wailing before the 9 to 5'ers woke up. this morning was a hair different though, something felt off, sure the cold weather was starting, but the cold felt too bitter for a Texas October morning. When the line was done its repairs, we jumped in the truck, and went to the yard. the yard usually had a handful of locomotives, and what was special about our yard was the special freight we hauled, high dollar equipment, and lots of money to lose. we were sitting in the shop, same spots as usual, sitting in front of the shop toolbox with all the boys around. there was a couple of cars coming up the gated dirt road, but not just lost traffic, a coordinated fleet. all black SUV's trailing in front of and behind a Cadillac El Dorado. behind the SUV's came what looked like a freightliner bread truck, which wasnt strange, they come through all the time with lower dollar shipments, oil drums, smaller rigging equipment, all that. the fleet called the office saying they were from CP rail looking to make a deal, but it felt weird, they can call, or betteryet, go to our actual headquarters instead of our maintenance and export depot. with hesitation we let them in. the leading 5 vehicles came toward us, while they tried to distract us from the last SUV and the bread truck from trailing off towards the valuable cargo section of our depot. Mark jumped onto the 4 wheeler to follow while myself, Jamie, and Derek all stayed to see what these unmarked vehicles wanted. as we suspected they claimed to be from CP rail in Edmonton, while it was sketchy it was convincing. and as they tried to broker a deal 3 shots rang out from across the yard, and not very long after, the rest of these men all pulled concealed firearms from their bodies. ducking, jamie and derek ran into the shop where the small armory, which was nothing more than 4 rifles and a couple of pistols, was. i tackled the closest guy to me, who had a gun aimed directly at me. we fought for a while, while the other group ran towards the high value section. it was a setup, all the expensive equipment not meant for your average joe was being taken - fuck even i dont know what it was. when Jamie and Derek came back, like 2 retarded Rambo's, they started chasing the other two while i put a round into the guy i was fightings stomach. surely he'd bleed out. when we reached the other part of the yard we would push forward trying to end these mens lives, like we found out they did to mark. the bread truck was facing me, with a guy in the drivers seat, couldnt tell what the fuck they stole but they got something. probably the government shit the men in black bring us to send into Galveston. when the door slammed on the truck and it peeled away, i got pinched by something - i was shot. right in the side, near a kidney i think. the pain got so bad i dropped to the ground and didnt wake up until what felt like months.

Part II, An Alias I Learned This Morning 


 in a hospital bed in Austin, the first words i formed were ""what the fuck happened"", and some big shot government guy told me what had presumably happened. they told me they got hold of a very secretive prototype, one to end any war for good.

""fuck. thats scary."" i thought

""you've got 2 options kid"" thats what the government guy said, ""either meet us in seattle for tomorrow, or continue living your life as it was, theyre looking for you though, they got your friends""

i wondered what the fuck i should do, this wasnt really a good thing was it? 

""Seattle. where?"" i managed to say

""Olivia's Cafe, cant miss it, ask for Janet. you'll be out of here in a few hours""

for the rest of my hospital visit i honestly just slept. i was too tired and sore for anything else. when 5:30 came about i finally got released, into Austin. i got the first cab to the airport and bought a one-way ticket into Seattle airport. plane left at 6:45, should be there by 10, maybe 11. most of the flight was just thinking about what the fuck my life turned into. I fell asleep somehow on the plane, even though my mind was racing with what if thoughts, and constantly wondering what the agent meant when he said ""theyre looking for you"". when the plane landed everything felt surreal, like it wasnt real life, just a bad dream after you eat too much food on Thanksgiving. i slept at the shitty motel just across from the airport, it smelt like feces and urine, and the bed was covered in roaches. the next morning came after a sleepless night, Olivia's Cafe ""hey, i need Janet, and also the biggest coffee you guys sell. long story""
the girl behind the counter said ""theyre in the back, come on""
i followed closely behind the woman behind the counter, into a back room where the men from the day before were. 
""theyre after you. theyre here. you gotta get the fuck outta here.""
""what? theyre HERE?""
""yeah. they found out we were in the hospital with you, i suspect it wont be long before they find the cafe. your new name is Eli Mercer. theres a 1980 Buick Estate out back. its yours. go as far north from here as you can.""
""alaska?""
""yeah. heres a credit card, dont worry about your spending. hide from cameras, tear up any receipts, dont leave a trace of your existence. We'll be in touch, Eli. Now get the hell out of here""


Part III, Hypothermic


i went to the back of the cafe where a 1980 Buick wagon sat, without second thought i drove. and drove i did. for hours driving in a cold sweat, no one on an icy highway through desolate mountain roads in B.C., all the way into yukon. Northbound, to Alaska. it was cold, and i felt hypothermic. finally when i felt safe i looked through the car, and in the glovebox sat a 6-shooter gun with only one round, but a box of .44 ammunition beside it, just in case they come for answers to the questions only i know. ""Im going to a place where even the sun cant find me"", i thought. just up the road was a gas station. i stopped in, hid my face from the camera like they said. when i got in, the gas station was basically empty, some teenager behind the counter, she looked cold and tired ""how long have you been here""
""i dont leave""
""im sorry, where do you sleep?""
""my family lives just out back in the trailer""
""pump 1""
""$64.80""
i tapped my government credit card, *beep*
""wanna sign the guest book?""
so i signed the guest book, Eli Mercer, the name i just learned.
""receipt?""
""no.. no thank you..""
as i was leaving the shitty old gas station the heat lamp was covered in dead flies, mosquitos, and other strange bugs id never seen. still hiding my face from the cameras i got back into my buick where it struggled to start in the harsh cold. i peeled out as fast as i could, i hit a snowbank though, but landed. now im back on the highway, northbound to alaska, hypothermic, where the sun cant find me. 

i kept driving, i finally made it about 3 hours from alaska, Eli Mercer was almost home.

1omu9q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1omu9q1/downstairs_neighbors_wont_stop_banging_their/,Downstairs neighbors won’t stop banging their ceiling.,"Starting in about April, my downstairs neighbors have been constantly banging their ceiling anytime my daughter makes ANY noise and it’s gotten worse now that she’s pulling herself onto things and crawling. 
I live in a very bad neighborhood, I’m talking every day there’s cops here, fireworks being shot into windows, the FBI arrested a man and the fbi also had to do a search in the lake etc. it’s ALWAYS something, this is not a safe place but it’s the only place we can afford rn while I get through school. 
Anyway, my daughter, like any baby does, makes noises, she stumbles, falls, claps, etc. 
and my neighbors keep banging their ceiling as hard as they can multiple times a day when she makes noises. 
I know it’s them banging because I have banged back once and then they banged back again. 

My daughter kicks her feet when she’s on her back, which in turn hits the floor, same with when she’s in her crib she bangs her feet against the floor of the crib. These thunks are barely anything, I can barely hear them when In another room, but my downstairs neighbors bang as hard as they can and scare my baby. 

Literally just today they banged the ceiling because my ten month old infant was clapping on the coffee table.. WHICH WASNT ON THE FLOOR. 

anyway I have tried to fix this.. I bought a mat to put under my daughter when she’s getting a change or when she’s eating and I need to do something but the neighbors still bang. 
They bang when she’s crawls on the floor, they bang when she falls down, they bang when she makes any kind of noise against the floor..

This has been making it scary for me to leave my apartment because I have to pass their apartment to get to my car. 

I also want to mention, that in our lease it states that normal daily noises happen and that there’s “quiet hours” from 7PM to I believe 5AM? My baby sleeps through the night, 7PM-7:30AM

when I put her in her crib she kicks for exactly five seconds then falls asleep (also wanna mention her crib isn’t against the floor either) 
But that sets off the neighbors. 

I feel like my baby moving would be considered normal daily noises happening. 
Also we have received a noise complaint back in September stating we were making too much noise but it never stated what it was and threatened to evict us if anymore notices had to come through(and yes this was from our landlord don’t worry) 
We tried emailing and calling them multiple times to clarify what the noise was but they never got back to us. 

I’m worried if it was the downstairs neighbors that we will get evicted due to them. 

I have tried using the mats, I have tried putting her on my lap or the couch or the crib to do changes and feedings but to no avail, they still bang if there’s any slight repeated noise from her against the floor. 

This is driving me crazy, having to deal with banging over and over again. 

I’ve tried recording it but I can never catch when they do it, I’d have to record 24/7 cause it’s always random.. some bangs they don’t bang back and others they do. 

What should I do? I was gonna go to the landlords office tomorrow but I don’t even know what to say or if they will take it seriously since I have no proof. ",0,1762120888.0,NewParents,2,0.5,False

Mark jumped onto the 4 wheeler to follow while myself, Jamie, and Derek all stayed to see what these unmarked vehicles wanted. as we suspected they claimed to be from CP rail in Edmonton, while it was sketchy it was convincing. and as they tried to broker a deal 3 shots rang out from across the yard, and not very long after, the rest of these men all pulled concealed firearms from their bodies. ducking, jamie and derek ran into the shop where the small armory, which was nothing more than 4 rifles and a couple of pistols, was. i tackled the closest guy to me, who had a gun aimed directly at me. we fought for a while, while the other group ran towards the high value section. it was a setup, all the expensive equipment not meant for your average joe was being taken - fuck even i dont know what it was. when Jamie and Derek came back, like 2 retarded Rambo's, they started chasing the other two while i put a round into the guy i was fightings stomach. surely he'd bleed out. when we reached the other part of the yard we would push forward trying to end these mens lives, like we found out they did to mark. the bread truck was facing me, with a guy in the drivers seat, couldnt tell what the fuck they stole but they got something. probably the government shit the men in black bring us to send into Galveston. when the door slammed on the truck and it peeled away, i got pinched by something - i was shot. right in the side, near a kidney i think. the pain got so bad i dropped to the ground and didnt wake up until what felt like months.

Part II, An Alias I Learned This Morning 


 in a hospital bed in Austin, the first words i formed were ""what the fuck happened"", and some big shot government guy told me what had presumably happened. they told me they got hold of a very secretive prototype, one to end the cold war for good.

""fuck. thats scary."" i thought

""you've got 2 options kid"" thats what the government guy said, ""either meet us in seattle for tomorrow, or continue living your life as it was, theyre looking for you though, they got your friends""

i wondered what the fuck i should do, this wasnt really a good thing was it? 

""Seattle. where?"" i managed to say

""Olivia's Cafe, cant miss it, ask for Janet. you'll be out of here in a few hours""

for the rest of my hospital visit i honestly just slept. i was too tired and sore for anything else. when 5:30 came about i finally got released, into Austin. i got the first cab to the airport and bought a one-way ticket into Seattle airport. plane left at 6:45, should be there by 10, maybe 11. most of the flight was just thinking about what the fuck my life turned into. I fell asleep somehow on the plane, even though my mind was racing with what if thoughts, and constantly wondering what the agent meant when he said ""theyre looking for you"". when the plane landed everything felt surreal, like it wasnt real life, just a bad dream after you eat too much food on Thanksgiving. i slept at the shitty motel just across from the airport, it smelt like feces and urine, and the bed was covered in roaches. the next morning came after a sleepless night, Olivia's Cafe ""hey, i need Janet, and also the biggest coffee you guys sell. long story""
the girl behind the counter said ""theyre in the back, come on""
i followed closely behind the woman behind the counter, into a back room where the men from the day before were. 
""theyre after you. theyre here. you gotta get the fuck outta here.""
""what? theyre HERE?""
""yeah. they found out we were in the hospital with you, i suspect it wont be long before they find the cafe. your new name is Eli Mercer. theres a 1980 Buick Estate out back. its yours. go as far north from here as you can.""
""alaska?""
""yeah. heres a credit card, dont worry about your spending. hide from cameras, tear up any receipts, dont leave a trace of your existence. We'll be in touch, Eli. Now get the hell out of here""


Part III, Hypothermic


i went to the back of the cafe where a 1980 Buick wagon sat, without second thought i drove. and drove i did. for hours driving in a cold sweat, no one on an icy highway through desolate mountain roads in B.C., all the way into yukon. Northbound, to Alaska. it was cold, and i felt hypothermic. finally when i felt safe i looked through the car, and in the glovebox sat a 6-shooter gun with only one round, but a box of .44 ammunition beside it, just in case they come for answers to the questions only i know. ""Im going to a place where even the sun cant find me"", i thought. just up the road was a gas station. i stopped in, hid my face from the camera like they said. when i got in, the gas station was basically empty, some teenager behind the counter, she looked cold and tired ""how long have you been here""
""i dont leave""
""im sorry, where do you sleep?""
""my family lives just out back in the trailer""
""pump 1""
""$64.80""
i tapped my government credit card, *beep*
""wanna sign the guest book?""
so i signed the guest book, Eli Mercer, the name i just learned.
""receipt?""
""no.. no thank you..""
as i was leaving the shitty old gas station the heat lamp was covered in dead flies, mosquitos, and other strange bugs id never seen. still hiding my face from the cameras i got back into my buick where it struggled to start in the harsh cold. i peeled out as fast as i could, i hit a snowbank though, but landed. now im back on the highway, northbound to alaska, hypothermic, where the sun cant find me. 

i kept driving, i finally made it about 3 hours from alaska, Eli Mercer was almost home. 
i can see them
i can hear them
i can feel them
speeding up behind
in an umarked hallucination
in a wilderness where the law cant hear me
shouting, begging mercy, on the corner while they kick my jaw in

driving
in a cold sweat
there is no one

(I’m 28 now) 

I dated a girl as a teenager for about two years, that relationship was pretty bad looking back on it, but it ended with her getting pregnant with another guys kid. There was never any sort of “breakup” she just completely ghosted me until about a month later someone came up to me in the gym and told me about her getting pregnant. 

Now fast forward to this relationship I’ve been in for the last 6 years (she is a much better girlfriend than that one I had as a teenager). She said she needed space and wanted to take a break in July. We have talked on the phone 4 times over the last 3 months and I thought we were making some progress, but was cool with taking it slow so this doesn’t happen again. We had plans to grab a coffee and talk this weekend but when I texted her yesterday morning she just ignored it. So I’m coming to terms with the likelihood that she’s just not interested anymore. 

What’s making me so frustrated is why can’t someone just tell me when they’re done with me? It feels horrible to be in this limbo, and I’ve been so heartbroken over it that I have been going to therapy for 2 months now. In my mind I know that this relationship is over but I’m so frustrated that I’m the last person to find out. (And I had to come to that realization on my own) 

Maybe she thinks she was letting me down gently but it’s made the heartbreak 10x worse because she strung me along for months while I wanted to work it out

The air down here smells like oil and rust. We’re beneath an abandoned NORAD-adjacent facility, built in the fifties, decommissioned in the eighties, and repurposed for NOVA Genetics in the nineties. Gotta love recycling.

What we’ve found—or what NOVA claims we’ve found—makes the discovery of the atom look like a waste of time. 

They call it Syberium — a viscous, violet liquid, drawn from the Chersky Range four years ago.

After examination, it yielded potential benefits for the subjects. Proceeding 14 tests, the conclusive answer is that Syberium acts as a growth accelerant and is extremely potent; as of now, only 20 CC is needed for complete growth. But...again, none of the subjects have made it out of the newborn stage,(sigh) all dying from rapid cellular decay.

I fear the Syberium itself is missing to endure the constant strain of duplicating molecules. We'd need a stabilizer of some sort.""

“His office was…lovely. Massive bookshelves rising from floor to ceiling curling themselves like ribs to the entry doors, within the shelves an extreme adornment of books varied as the colors of the light spectrum.

A cherry mahogany desk, a single chair behind it, an exquisite couch to repose oneself, behind it all a wall of black marble exquisitely inlaid with gold accents representing the solar system adorned with thousands of stars.

He stood with his back to me, hands clasped behind him. Same suit, same inner fear. When his voice came it wasn't speaking. It was a whisper that felt like it landed directly in my inner ear. Like a demon making me surrender to his wicked whims.

‘Doctor O’Donnell,’ he said. ‘You’ve done well. The little one—Nyx—is proof of concept. Proof that Syberium and the algae can coexist without degradation.’”

(Pause)

“My mouth was dry. Like the desert we were stationed in.
The room was dark, very dark.

He then turned. I still couldn’t see his eyes; the sunglasses
completely masking his sockets.

He didn’t sit. He leaned closer. ‘We’ve waited long enough for men to catch up to their ideas,’ he whispered. ‘Now our ideas will grow men.’”

""He walked a few feet and pressed a button on the wall, a drink came out, a delicate marshmallow smelling espresso cup.

The smell was like Lsd... tickling the back of my amygdala, striking a complete fear response immediately replaced with pure benign pleasure.

The coffee then began to smell like the freshly buttered pancakes my mom used to make in the morning for me, then cinnamon buns like my grandmother's place.

The scent shifted every few seconds, until it returned to a soft fire licked marshmallow aroma, all those flavors seeping of nostalgia, the man then sipped the cup gently.

I noticed when his lips parted from the drink, his tongue was partly purple as though stained by a food.

He proceeded to sit down on the chair rolling it to the start of the desk, depositing his ceramic on a coaster.""

(paper shuffle)

“He slid a folder toward me. No logo. No title. Inside, a requisition order for primate embryos and human stem cell lines.

The bottom line read, simply: ‘Phase Two: Homo sapiens trials. Directive Immediate.’

I stammered something about protocol. Ethics committees. He laughed — no sound came out, just a low vibration in my eardrum.

Then he said: ‘You'll see the files. You know the potential. We’ve cured cancer. We’ve accelerated evolution. You think our species can wait?’

""I remembered Mark today. That note — OVERLORD PASS OVER 557 — has been burning in my mind. Curiosity finally won.

I slipped into my manager's office after lights-out. Computer still running. Login screen waiting. I typed in OVERLORD… password 557.

It worked.

Whole directories opened like a vault. Dozens of projects, dates stretching back into the eighties. But one file was marked red. Project Overgrowth.""

(DRRRRR—static)
(Click)

""It was a human trial. Subject codename: HELIX.

Male, early forties. Terminal — stage four liver cancer. The file described him as ‘selected for expendability.’ Government phrasing for dying anyway.

They placed him in a sealed observation room with a faint NOVA logo on the door. Bed. Chair. Nothing else.

First injection: Syberium, direct to the neocortex, targeting ARHGAP11B — the gene linked to cortical expansion.

On paper it was simple: accelerate brain growth, heal the body. A miracle in a syringe.”

(Pause. Paper shuffle)
“But it didn’t heal. It rewrote.

By day 3 the cancer was gone, but the scans showed something worse.

The Syberium had threaded into every cell, photo-reactive, violet veins glowing under the skin.

His immune system didn’t just kill tumors — it killed everything, rebuilding tissue with a strange lattice, the chemical, binding itself to the host.

He didn’t speak anymore. He didn’t sleep. He sat awake, eyes open, as if listening to something outside human range.""

(Click-Clack)
""Day four — the skull fractures began. His brain pushed against bone, swelling, cracking sutures and then resealing itself with every pulse.

Like the body couldn’t decide if it was healing or birthing something new. The glass walls shook from his screams.

When they resumed injections, the swelling receded, but his eyes stayed purple — and the room itself seemed darker around him, like the light bent away.”

(Silence. Deep breath)
""They noted psychological collapse. Recording transcript, day five:

‘42…42 is the answer…atoms tell me…they glow, like stars, endless, endless. You can’t contain it. It doesn’t belong to you…’

Then he lunged at the glass. Whispered through blood and cracks:

‘You cannot control what you do not understand. The old wrath will return. We have stolen the throne.’”

And then, in stamped red:
[PATIENT TERMINATED].

Signed with nothing but a DNA helix emblem. No names. No initials.""

*“Marie?”*

The fire inside of my head rages, poisonous, relentless, cruel, the first licks of heat engulfing, suffocating, agonizing. 

I'm burning for seconds that stretch into minutes, then hours. Days. Weeks. 

Years. 

How long will I burn? 

I am trapped inside a body that no longer belongs to me. 

My limbs are ghosts, once tethered, now only a shiver. 

I can’t escape. 

The ice comes, a vicious tidal wave dousing the flames. It locks me in place, freezes my thoughts, stills my heart, creeps across my mind. I can’t think. 

I can’t breathe. Breathing is involuntary, so why is it something my body does not want to do? Why is inhaling like swallowing shards of glass? 

Breathing is agony. 

Thinking is a chore. 

I hold onto Marie. 

Marie is my name. Marie is who I am.

*“Marie.”*

I echo the voice. 

The voice that feels distant and wrong. I am a ghost and he is real. I am ignited and he is molten frost.

*“Come on, Marie, you need to get up!”*

*“Nicholas.”* Another voice cuts through, different, harsher, urgent. *“You are a newborn.” The second voice is suddenly closer. “Do you want to rip her throat out?”*

Sensation hits me. Air that’s still. Loud cracks through silence, gunshots. Sharp breaths find my ear.

*“Marie, please. Wake up.”*

Hands wrap around mine, fingers entangling. They are colder than me. They feel like home.

The voice is no longer something I try to imitate, it’s commanding, raw, and real, and almost enough to pull me from oblivion. 

Hands press hard against my chest, pinning me down as my body jerks violently. I can barely feel the fire. 

I only feel him; his skin is unlike my own. It is still, while blood pumps through mine, severing my nerve endings. 

*“Don’t look for me,”* the voice hisses. *“Stay here. Don’t go outside, do you understand me? Marie, you need to hide.”*

His voice shatters, emotion bleeding through as his fingers tighten around mine.

*“All those stupid promises we made,”* he whispers. *“You need to forget them. Forget them and forget me. All right?”*

A loud bang.

The fire takes me once more.

Down.

Down.

Down.

Orange meets yellow; yellow meets my skin, bone, and blood, erupting, prickling through every vein, every nerve ending, flames licking across my skull and bleeding into my brain. Every organ is ablaze.

Every part of me erupts. 

Ignited, I fight to think, to keep my thoughts from turning into nothing. I have to remember what the voice said, but what did the voice say? What is the voice? 

What was I trying to cling to? 

I imagine the onslaught like a storm inside my blood. 

The storm never stops, never falters, never dies down until I am screeching without a mouth, until I am begging to die.

Until I want the dark.

Time passes.

Thoughts are fragmented.

How long has passed?

When words in the fog resume, I am no longer burning. The fire has been put out.

The voice is gone, a phantom in my mind.

*“Marie?”*

Silence rushes through my ears as my fingers bend. Shapes dance behind my eyelids. Cold.

This new body is cold. I have awoken inside a corpse that no longer pumps and beats and bleeds.

I try to move my fingers. Then my hand. My toes curl. Something sharp pricks at the roof of my mouth.

Nicholas.

His name parts my new lips, a sharp tingle scratches my throat.

I open my eyes.

…

ONE.

October 15th, 1989.

Newborn parties were overrated. My legs dangled off the roof of the town hall, music blasting in my ears, while below me my party went on without me. 

All my friends were having the time of their lives. 

Meanwhile, I was mourning my humanity, a mix of preservative gummies and Mom’s fake blood stuck to my tongue with a half-empty Coke can resting in my lap. 

I sipped it slowly. Some half-vampire I was.

“Ah, yes! The vampire princess’s favorite snack. Sour Patch Kids.” 

It didn't take long for the Golden boy himself, and the most recent kid to develop his big-boy teeth, to join me.

Nicholas Invinia was the boy I was destined to marry once reborn, the one I was meant to spend the rest of eternity with.

I didn't ask for his company, but he followed me anyway, after stalking me all the way through my parents' farewell speech. That's what suitors did. 

Especially ones my father favored. 

Dropping down beside me, his head found my shoulder. I caught the sharp scent of whiskey. Nicholas smelled like a wino. 

Male vampires, especially fledglings, barely faced any consequences when showing clear signs of indulging in human delicacies. Meanwhile, I was slapped for drinking soda. Nick leaned over and snatched a handful of candy. “Tired of our party?”

Nicholas and I happened to share a birthday, and as my fiancée, it only made sense that I shared it with him.

Our newborn party, what my parents called a “coming of age celebration,” was really just a countdown to letting go of all of this. Warmth in my hands. Gummies in my lap. Breath in my lungs. 

I had thought I wanted to be a vampire. Now, so close to rebirth, I clutched my humanity a little tighter, like a blanket. 

Nick was right. I wanted to escape, from the party, from the pressure-cooker smiles of adults, from the word-vomit that had become increasingly hard to swallow. 

I wanted to escape judgmental stares behind wine glasses.

The younger fledglings were easier; they were still human, after all. But the older ones, Aunt Emilia and Uncle Wyatt, wasted no time. “Marie! How are you, darlin’?” 

Aunt Emilia’s southern drawl rolled off her tongue like bourbon, pulling me into a perfume hug that felt like a trap. The party was fun at first. 

What was supposed to be a celebration for me and Nicholas had been overrun by the coven, their razor-sharp smiles scaring away my oblivious human friends. 

Aunt Emilia was radiant in a revealing red dress, blonde curls piled atop her head. 

Almost two thousand years old, she looked thirty-five. “Baby girl, haven’t your teeth come in yet? Is your mother not giving you enough animal blood with your meals? How does she expect you to be reborn if she can’t even manage the basics?”

She was right. Newborn vampires do need animal blood to complete the change. But if a fledgling doesn’t take in small amounts of human blood during adolescence, there’s a chance their body might reject the transformation. 

Mom was strict about it. Every meal came with a small glass of animal blood. I couldn’t stand it. It was too thick, too heavy, like licking the inside of a shower drain. 

According to my aunt, that meant my “development was in jeopardy.”

Half-vampires were strange. We were born human and capable of becoming eternal. In our coven, every child faced a choice at eighteen: die and be reborn a vampire or leave and cling to humanity. 

I had already made mine, or rather, it had been made for me. It wasn't a choice in the coven I was born into; children don't get to choose their humanity. 

With my parents being devoted to old vampire traditions, Mommy and Daddy preferred to stick to being pro-hunting humans and pro-drinking human blood while other covens had evolved, choosing coexistence over slaughter. From a young age, I was taught it was us against them. 

Survival versus surrender. Instinct versus restraint. We were the hunters and they were the prey. So of course, I was destined to become one. If I didn’t, I’d be cast out.

So, for me, puberty arrived as a red stain on my jeans and a brand-new set of baby fangs.

Nicholas’s real fangs had come in early. So, he’d spent half of the night being prodded and poked and praised by my relatives. Not that I was jealous. 

And I definitely wasn’t. Risking a glance at his looming shadow next to me, I was secretly seething. 

He was annoyingly attractive for a fledgling, especially when we were supposed to look like corpses before turning sixteen. Tousled blonde hair pinned by Ray-Bans, pale skin, and a jawline sharper than his teeth. Arrogant. Already flirting with alcoholism. Nicholas didn’t look like a vampire. 

He looked like River Phoenix. 

There was far too much color in his cheeks. 

His fashion sense defied coven standards, wearing a leather jacket and acid-wash jeans, paired with socks and sandals.

He whipped off his glasses. “Not in the mood to party?”

I avoided his eyes. “Go away.”

Leaning back, Nicholas made himself comfortable.  “Not until you tell me what’s wrong.”

My mouth moved before I could stop it; it happened so fast, like it had a will of its own, a reflex I couldn't stop. “I don’t think I want to be a vampire anymore.”

Nicholas whistled. “Sounds like nerves, darlin’,” he said, mocking my aunt’s accent.

I held his gaze. “Call me that again and I’ll throw you off the roof.”

He made a show of eating my candy, leaning back on his elbows and flashing a dazzling grin each time he popped one into his mouth, tilting his head so the light hit his newly elongated teeth just right. 

Once upon a time, when we had both been proud members of the “No Fangs Club,” little Nicholas had stabbed at his stubborn baby teeth, loudly declaring, “Maybe I don’t want to be a vampire!”

Which was a far cry from now.

“So, what, are you just going to abandon the coven?” Nicholas turned to me, eyes piercing, just like the elders. 

I wasn’t surprised. Nicholas’s father was the leader of a rival coven who, like my parents, were traditionalists. Nick had been drinking animal blood since he was twelve. No wonder his fangs came early. 

I opened my mouth to answer, but I was scared of what would come out.

I chewed a piece of candy instead, which was growing sour in my mouth. I checked the pack, frustration burning in me. They weren’t even the sour ones. 

Mom had told me my taste buds would start to change before my rebirth. 

Part of me thought she was joking. Then my stomach lurched suddenly, and the sweet taste turned to bile. 

Urgh. I spat it out. I tried another and spat that one out too.

I didn’t realize I was shoving candy into my mouth and choking it back, tears stinging my eyes, until his fingers held mine. 

All I could think about was how warm he was and how much I would miss it, the blood under his skin, the sweat on his palms, the blooming blush in his cheeks. 

Nicholas jumped up and kicked off his sandals. “Dance with me.”

“What?” I said, my breath caught between a gasp and a laugh. “There’s no music.”

“We don’t need music.”

He pulled me to my feet, and I staggered, my head spinning. Nicholas took my hand like we were at a ball, twirling me into a dizzy waltz. I imagined we were. Glittering lights. An expanse of glass windows. 

Shadows dancing around us. My lungs burned; a scream clawed at my throat. 

I thought we were going to fall when he spun me again, but instead, I flew. 

My body seemed to remember steps I’d never learned. We were dancing. 

My clammy hands clung to his. 

Words burned on my tongue. “We can go, we can stay human, you and me. We can see the world, grow old together.

Under the pale light of the full moon, Nicholas’s grin widened, and I caught the glint of his teeth.

“What’s the first thing you're going to do as a vampire?”

His words were like knives splitting my spine. I flinched, trying to pull away. Trying to get away from him. The closer I was to him, the harder it was to make my decision. “I don’t want to talk about it.” 

He inclined his head, lips pricking. “I'm your fiancée.” 

“Not yet.”

Nicholas laughed, and it was contagious, bleeding into me. I almost laughed myself. “So, you’re saying you don’t want to spend eternity with me?”

He was stalling. I could tell. Nicholas Invinia couldn't go five minutes without talking about himself, and here he was, dancing with me under the moon, suspiciously close to midnight. 

I pulled him towards me, so close, his breath tickling cheeks. “Did my father ask you to come talk to me?” 

He responded with a knowing smirk. “What makes you think that?” Nicholas pulled me closer, and like magnets forced apart, we snapped back. 

We were push and pull, repelling and snapping together. I stumbled, nearly falling, but he caught me against his chest, fast, vivid, dizzying. 

His breath grazed my ear, lips brushing dangerously close to my neck. Sharp points stabbed at my throat, and I felt a rush of pleasure, of heat, creeping through me. 

It took every part of me, body, mind, and soul, to not give in to temptation. 

“Okay, fine, busted,” he murmured, stepping back. 

His pace quickened into something sharper, almost a foxtrot. 

“Tell me. Why does the vampire princess want to stay human?”

“A heartbeat,” I said, matching his steps again. This time, I led, spinning him around. “I hate the taste of blood.” 

I drew him closer, letting my lips hover at his throat. “I like school. I like my friends. 

I want to go to college, to travel the world, I want to—” I stopped myself, breathless but unwilling to let go. Lies tasted like vomit. 

Yet lies were the only thing keeping me anchored. 

School, college, growing old, none of it mattered. 

Of course I wanted to be a newborn; of course I wanted to marry Nicholas.

“You know you can do all that as a vampire,” Nicholas said, taking control again. His eyes followed mine, vicious, dizzying, penetrating. 

The dance unraveled, falling apart, our steps uneven, clashing and coming together. “School, college, human friends, you know you can keep them.” 

He spun me across the rooftop, the wind tangling in my hair, until the motion stopped abruptly. 

His fingers loosened around mine, and I didn’t realize until I opened my eyes that the roof had vanished beneath our feet, pooling darkness awaiting below.

I froze, body arched, hair dangling, breath catching, as I met his deep green eyes. So close to falling. A scream clawed at my throat. Was this his plan all along? To make me fall? Was that my father’s order? Death wouldn’t kill me. Death would turn me. 

I fought to maintain my nonchalance, aware of my sharp, heavy breaths, my dress weighing me down.

“This is cruel,” I squeezed out.

Nick’s expression didn’t waver. “Tell me the real reason you don’t want to be a vampire, Marie.”

“So you can drop me?” I choked out, my voice cracking. Vulnerability bled through me, my humanity feeling like a disease. I was running on autopilot. The cry that tore from my throat was childish, too human. “Don’t let go!”

“I won’t.” His face was steady, somehow trustworthy.

I folded. Maybe it was the shame of hiding what I was from my parents. Maybe it was how Nick made me feel. “I’m scared,” I whispered. The words tasted like bile, thick and shameful. “I don’t want to reject it.”

Nick’s brows furrowed. “Reject what?”

“Pull me up,” I hissed, panic flooding through me. My body hung in nothingness, tethered to the void. I reached for his arm, slipping every time. “Now!”

When he didn’t, I splintered apart, everything inside me breaking loose in a single shriek. “I don’t drink animal blood,” I gasped. I counted my breaths. 

One. Two. Three. Four.

How many breaths would it take before I hit the ground?

“Mom thinks she’s been feeding me animal blood since I was a… whoa.” I made the mistake of looking down. Fuck. 

My stomach lurched, and I snapped my gaze back to Nicholas’s piercing eyes.

“I won’t drop you,” he said. “Go on.”

“Since I was a kid,” I whispered, clutching him tighter. “I used to dump it. Pretend to drink it. Which means when I die, I’ll reject the change.”

For a moment, he just stared, blank, trance-like.

Then he blinked, laughed, and tightened his grip around my wrist, yanking me up. “You’re not serious.”

Frustration boiled my blood. “I'm sorry, is my completely justifiable existential dread *funny* to you?” 

Nicholas smiled, pulling me from the dark until I was in his arms again, trembling, clinging to his neck. 

He was usually so composed, at least in front of my father, the perfect heir to the coven, my future husband. 

But right now, Nicholas was just an eighteen-year-old kid, a drunken fledgling. 

He opened his mouth, ready to spill whatever cliché shit bubbling in his head, then stumbled, tripped over my foot, and we hit the ground together. 

I slammed down on top of him, and he smiled up at me like all of this was a game. I tried to wrench my arms free, but his grip was iron, pinning me in place. 

Was he mocking me? 

Nicholas leaned in, a single strand of blond hair falling into his eyes. 

I could feel his breath, warm and human. His heartbeat pounded beneath me. 

He smelled of whiskey, sour candy, and sweat. “Hey, Marie?”

The world seemed to stop. His eyes pinned me in place, and I was far too close to his lips. My breath hitched, heat climbing up my neck, heavy and consuming. 

Whatever filled me was intoxicating, feral, driving me closer until his breaths fluttered my cheek. I found my voice, but I didn't trust it. I didn't trust my body, and my hapless wandering hands. 

“What?”

He cupped my cheek and leaned in. I panicked. This was my first kiss, my first kiss as a human, with a heart that actually beat. But instead of meeting my lips, his lips found my ear. Nicholas rolled on top of me, his eyes daring me to resist. “That’s just a fairy tale,” he whispered.

“My aunt,” I countered, frozen by his smile. “She said…”

“Your aunt?” Nick smirked. “She was just repeating an old wives’ tale from the dark ages. Traditional vampire families use them to scare fledglings into submission.” 

He straightened, eyes sharp. “My dad tried that trick on me when I refused animal blood. It didn’t work. Only fools fall for it.” He grinned and flicked me on the nose. 

“You really think you can just reject the change? Are you an idiot, Marie?”

I shoved him off me with a sharp kick. The heat of the moment drained away. “*Fools*?”

“Yes.” Nicholas jumped up, reached out for my hand and yanked me to my feet. He winked. “Fools.”

I lost control and smacked him. “Asshole.”

“You’re missing your party,” Nicholas said, folding his arms.

“I don’t care.”

“Well, what if I stayed with you?” He stepped closer, too close. I felt my breath falter, my heart fluttered. 

“Your aunt won’t bother you if I’m there. We can dance, and drink pineapple wine coolers when our parents aren't watching.” 

He caught my arms and swung them playfully. “Just have fun. No vampire talk, no reminiscing, and definitely no crying.” His smile softened. “It’ll just be us.”

“Do you even want to be a vampire?” I blurted.

His eyes were dark. “Why wouldn’t I?” 

Nicholas tugged me back toward the party, and I stumbled after him. I could have let go. I could have pulled away and run, like I had planned to all night. But I didn’t. Somehow, I couldn’t let go of his hand.

He led me straight into a room full of judgmental eyes and onto the dance floor, right in the middle of Take On Me. 

I ignored my aunt’s glare, my father’s looming figure washed in neon, and my mother’s tense smile. 

Instead, I downed colorful shots with my human friends and nearly died laughing at Nicholas’s dance moves.

Time slipped by. When the crowd thinned and it was just the two of us, his arms draped over my shoulders. Midnight crept closer. Our coven circled the room like hungry sharks, eager for the turning.

I turned away from them and pressed my face into Nick’s chest. Song after song drifted through the speakers, Whitney Houston, Simple Minds, Generation X, and I let myself disappear into him. The music faded into a soft hum. He never let go.

“I’ll tell you something embarrassing about myself if you do the same,” Nick murmured into my hair.

“Why?” I laughed.

“I dunno. Maybe I’m stalling.”

I didn’t even have to think about it. “That was my first kiss,” I said. “The one with you.”

“Oh,” he said. “I was going to say I have a birthmark on my thigh that looks remarkably like Italy.”

“You’re kidding.”

I could sense his grin. “I am 100% serious.”

There was something achingly human about Nicholas, his scent, his smile, even his drinking problem. It was all him. 

I couldn’t imagine what he would be like as a mindless newborn, lost to bloodlust during his first vampiric year. 

I wouldn’t even be there to see it. 

Mom and Dad planned to lock me in the cellar until my own thirst passed.

The jukebox clicked off. Dad had already pulled the plug.

Midnight.

“Do you ever get the feeling that it's kinda weird that vampirism is like; not a choice?” Nicholas hummed into my hair. “Maybe I'm crazy—” he chuckled. “And my dad would definitely say I am—”

“Kids.” One of the elders spoke from across the room. He was blocking the door.  “It's almost time.” 

“If you’re planning to run and stay human, I won’t stop you,” Nicholas murmured into my shoulder as the last notes died away. 

“I’ll distract your dad. You just have to run.” His hands slipped from my waist. 

“I’ll make a scene, pretend I’m sick or something. I'm a pretty good actor.” 

I could sense his grin. “Then you slip out the back door, and you’re home free.”

I risked a glance behind me. The back door near the buffet table was open, light spilling into the night. 

I could run, yet somehow I couldn’t let go of Nicholas. So close. 

Mom wasn't watching. Dad was talking to the elders. I made my decision knowing he would protect me if I ran. 

Instead of giving in to temptation, I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him closer. I didn’t speak. I didn’t need to.

“Marie.” Nick’s eyes found mine. “Go.” 

“Promise me,” I blurted before I could stop myself. “The moment you wake up, you’ll come find me.”

Nicholas tilted his head, a crooked smirk tugging at his lips. “When I'm a mindless newborn driven by blood?”

“When we’re *both* mindless newborns driven by blood,” I corrected him.

I wasn’t sure if I loved him as a vampire, not yet. Maybe not ever, even as my husband. But this part of him, this Nicholas, I couldn’t let go.

I let myself be human, just once more. I cupped his cheeks, drinking in his warmth, and kissed him. 

Slowly. Savoring him. He tasted of raspberries and nicotine, and by the time he was kissing me back, his hands had found my face, desperate, almost feral. 

Then cold fingers clamped down on my shoulder, yanking me away. Mom. 

Her scent hit me like a storm. I opened my eyes to see Nicholas being pulled back by his family, still grinning, wiping my lipstick from his chin as his father scolded him.

“Marie.” Mom grabbed my shoulders and shook me. Her eyes were narrow, catlike. 

Her confident smile was a lie; she was just as worried I might reject the change. 

Aunt Emilia had been filling her head with nonsense since I turned twelve. 

Instead of hugging me goodbye, her fingers crept down my arm and tightened around my wrist. 

She marched me into the kitchen, poured two bags of animal blood into a cup, and forced me to drink it all. I gagged at the taste, the texture, the metallic tang.

“All of it,” Mom ordered, leaning against the counter with her arms crossed. “Your aunt thinks you’re not drinking enough blood.” 

“Fascinating,” I muttered, downing the last of the dregs. By the third gulp, the taste barely bothered me. 

I set the cup down and wiped my lips. Suddenly, I was back on the roof, dancing with Nicholas, his teeth grazing my neck, the world falling away. I was weightless. 

Dancing on clouds. 

I blinked the memory away. If being a vampire meant being with Nicholas Invinia, then so be it.

“Can I go be reborn now, Mother?”

Mom rolled her eyes, but she did pull me into an awkward hug, pulling away and cupping my face.

Her smile was practiced but firm, and I appreciated that.

“I’m proud of you, honey,” she said, her fingers combing gently through my ponytail.

I liked to think she was savoring my humanity too, my beating heart, the warmth beneath my skin. Part of me wanted to ask if I could take Nick and run. Another part wanted to stay, to claim my place in the coven, to be exactly what my mother wanted.

“Taking this next step is scary, yes,” she continued, “but trust me, once a year has passed and your thirst settles, you’ll be a beautiful young woman, ready to lead.”

Mom’s lips curved into a knowing smirk as her hands rested on my shoulders. “The young prince makes you happy,” she said. “Your heart’s racing, and you’re practically radiating hormones.”

“Mom,” I said, my voice splintering.

Instead of answering, she took my hand and led me down the cement stairs to the basement. Candles flickered in the dark, their orange light dancing over two open coffins. Nicholas sat cross-legged on his own, his father kneeling before him.

Cornelius Invinia looked exactly like what you would imagine a two-thousand-year-old vampire to be, tall and ghastly, almost like a Halloween costume brought to life. Bulging eyes. Skin white as bone.

Nicholas rolled his eyes, ignoring his father’s lecture, until he noticed me. 

His face broke into a grin. “Hey!” He raised his hand to wave, lips moving as if to beckon me over, maybe to say goodbye. 

Butterflies erupted in my gut. Fluttering. I took that moment to memorize him: the slight furrow in his brow, his bright eyes the color of coffee beans, that one single strand of hair dipping in his eyes. His scent. Candy. Stale alcohol. 

Nicholas was my first love, the first person who made me want to be a vampire.

Then his father’s skeletal fingers closed around his throat, and with a single, jolting movement and a sickening crack, snapped his neck.

“Marie,” Mom murmured, tightening her grip on my shoulder as I lunged forward, my heart leaping into my throat. 

“It’s okay,” she said softly. “Male fledglings prefer a real death over drinking poison like females.” But I knew she was lying. 

It looked deliberate. Cornelius had seen his son feeling, showing emotion, love. Was he not allowed to smile? To be happy?

My head spun as Mom guided me toward my coffin. Candlelight flickered around me, the world turning dizzy and dim. 

Was that what the look in his eyes had meant? *“Why wouldn’t I?”* Nicholas had said, darkness clouding his expression and curling his smile. 

And just like that, the boy I knew, the boy I loved, was gone. 

Cornelius caught his son’s body as it crumpled, placed him in the coffin, and shut it.

“Maribelle,” he said with a nod and smile. “Happy birthday.”

My stomach twisted. Words clawed at my throat, words that would get me exiled from the coven if I spoke them.

As if sensing it, Mom’s nails dug into the bare skin of my shoulder.

I climbed into my coffin obediently, took the chalice she handed me, and gulped it down.

Mom leaned forward when my vision feathered and the chalice slipped out of my fingers.

“You're going to be okay,” she whispered. ”You're thinking about rejecting the change, aren't you?” 

—

“Yes,” I said aloud, to nothing and nobody, to my mother’s dusty basement ceiling.

The first thing I noticed when I awoke was sunlight pouring through the windows. 

Mom was gone. My coffin was open, and I was staring up at cobwebs strung across the ceiling and hanging in the corners. 

Shaking away the fog clouding up my mind, I blinked. 

“Mom?” I called into the emptiness. 

The room felt hollow. The silence was deafening.

I sat up. I was no longer in the basement. Instead, I was inside Mom’ country house. I recognized my mother’s childhood bedroom. Everything was clear. Everything was perfect. I placed my hand over my heart. Nothing. I breathed into my palms. Nothing. 

Climbing out of my coffin, I glimpsed dark red splashes across the carpet floor. The corpse of a deer lay nearby, crumpled and drained of its blood. 

My dress was spattered scarlet, my hands ingrained with my meals, both human and animal, trails running down my neck and chin. I found myself smiling. Animal corpses meant I had completed the change and my year of bloodthirst. 

Traces of my lost year lay in each mutilated animal laying rotting on the floor. 

My throat was scratchy, but I wasn't the type of hungry I'd feared. I thought vampirism would be painful. I thought it would be endless, merciless hunger until I gave in and slaughtered every beating heart in my vicinity. Vampirism wasn't mindless thirst. It was.. still. Peaceful. 

No beating heart, but I had maintained my mind. I had maintained my memories. “Nick.” His name felt both fresh and ancient clinging to my new tongue. 

I threw open his coffin, but all that remained was his silky white bed and the suit he had been buried in.

My attention turned to the door, barricaded by a bookcase. I cocked my head. Strange. Mom wouldn’t lock me in, especially after a year had already passed. 

Unless my thirst had made me a danger to humans, and they’d discovered our existence. The window was open, curtains whipping in the breeze. I jumped out easily, landing on the driveway. The smell hit me immediately.

Rot.

Sour and visceral, wrapping around my senses, suffocating my nose and throat.

Mom’s summer house sat on the edge of town. It had once been my teenage getaway with human friends, the lake curling around it like a silver ribbon. 

I remembered the long stretch of field I used to play in. My legs moved, somehow. 

One moment I was standing outside the house, its wooden canopy and cherry blossom trees familiar, the rocking chair I used to curl up in and watch the sunset, and the next I was following the smell hanging thick in the air. 

I stumbled; my new senses felt wrong, my steps too quick, sending me to my knees. 

What did I do? I thought, dizzy. In that year I couldn’t remember, the year rage and hunger had ripped through me, what the fuck had I done?

The smell led me to the field from my memories.

Now it was unrecognizable, surrounded by barbed wire and a ten foot wall.

Wooden stakes were driven into the ground, and through them, heads were impaled.

Human heads. Thousands of them.

I started forward, stumbling.

Did we do this?

They stuck out like puppets, fake, straw hair caught in the wind. A familiar face came into view: pale white skin, eyes long since popped from their sockets, skeletal teeth glittering in the late sun. 

Cornelius Invinia. Something thick and sour crept up my throat, a slew of slime. Human, but the taste, stringy. Maybe intestines. Whoever I had mindlessly devoured as a newborn.

I passed another face that stood out. Her head was still connected to splintered bone forced through the stake, blonde curls catching the violent breeze.

Aunt Emilia.

Another head, its skull caved in, tongue a rotting slug hanging from its mouth.

Uncle Wyatt.

Lydia.

Smallwood.

Klause.

Evangeline.

I kept going, breathless, my head spinning, thoughts ignited, examining each one.

Not humans. Vampires, our entire coven. The realization slammed into me, cruel and agonizing, as I found the one person I didn’t want to find, the one who buckled my legs. 

My trembling hands found what had once been her beautiful, youthful face, skin ripped from the bone, skeletal teeth still frozen in a scream. 

I barely registered my mother’s appearance as a human. 

I’d been selfish, always thinking of myself, never appreciating her beauty.

She had been simple-looking, thick brown hair pulled into a ponytail, skin pale as snow.

Now my mother was nothing, an empty husk of decaying flesh, skewered on a stick.

I stepped back. No tears. No suffocating throat or pain in my chest. I was beautifully numb. Mom was right. Human emotions would have destroyed me.

“Hey!”

The voice split through me, my nerve endings jerking.

Human.

Two humans were coming towards me. Armed and masked.

I could have killed them. I could have ripped them apart.

Instead, I left, away from the massacre of my family and the guilt of not being there to save them. 

I washed my dress in the river and stole a jacket from someone’s yard and hitched a ride with a group of students driving a strange-looking car. 

There was no radio; music came straight from the car itself. The seats were slick, and instead of keys in the ignition, the driver pressed a button. 

I asked if anyone knew about the massacre in the town, and he just laughed and cranked up the volume. 

The other humans remained silent. Before I changed, there had always been tension between our covens.

The Montgomerys wanted us to switch to a vegetarian diet, and the Invinias agreed to relations with our coven through our arranged marriage. 

I fought to keep my words to myself. Humans were never to be trusted, even the ones who offered rides. One person was missing from that expanse of rotting faces, Nicholas. He had gotten away. 

Entering the city, I was determined to find him.

I wasn’t expecting the looming mechanical wall splitting the highway. On it, a label read: ZONE 3.

I stuck my head out of the window. “What was that?” I asked the driver, who drove straight through. 

He shot me a grin. “It keeps out the monsters, sweetheart.” He dropped me off by the side of the road, winked, and added, “See ya later, beautiful!”

The strip of stores was gone, replaced by towering, businesslike buildings. 

I joined a bustling crowd, all of them clutching black rectangles. I definitely wasn't in 1989 anymore. Skyscrapers scraped the sky, their windows forming a dizzying checkerboard. Dazzling. Beautiful. 

Yet I couldn’t ignore the vast expanse of screens on every building, flickering with phantom faces. Vampires.

For a moment, I was frozen, glued to one screen. The face was familiar from childhood.

“What do those faces mean?” I asked a woman passing by. 

She glared, whipped out her black rectangle and aimed it like a gun. Her scent was strawberries. Coffee. Lipstick. Stale sex. Her pulse was fast, almost frantic. 

“Oh my god,” she said, lips curling into a smile. She twisted, pointing at the one above us. “You literally look, like, *so* bloodsucker coded.”

I muttered, “Thanks,” lowered my head, and kept walking.

Straight into someone else. 

“Oops!” The person’s laugh split through my thoughts, and something twisted in my gut. “Sorry, dude!”

The man stood over me, unchanged, as if time had skipped right past him. 

His thick blonde hair was neatly cut now, no longer shaggy, no longer something I wanted to run my fingers through. 

Ray-Bans hid his eyes, his lips breaking out into a grin. His clothes weren’t his: a trench coat over jeans and a tee. 

On his wrist, a strange blue light glowed beneath his skin. The realization was quick.

Nicholas’s son.

When he whipped off his glasses, revealing those same coffee brown eyes, no. It was Nicholas.

Relief collided with confusion and pain as he shot me a grin, a perfect, human smile. 

No spikes, no fangs. 

His smile vanished the moment I stiffened, my world shattering around me. 

He didn’t recognize me. I stepped forward, aching to wrap my arms around him, but he held back, corking something into his ear. Headphones. But wireless. 

“Sorry,” he said sheepishly. “I was listening to music. I haven't had my morning coffee.”

“Nick.” I managed to get out. “It's me. Marie.” 

Nick’s eyes darkened. “Is this some kind of TikTok thing you're doing?”

I ignored that. “The coven,” I whispered. “Nicholas, they're all dead. The Montgomery coven—”

Nicholas politely shoved me back. “I think you’ve got the wrong guy! Anyway, this has been… totally not awkward. Have fun in the psych ward.” 

He tried to step around me, but I moved to block him. “Okay,” Nick’s smile returned, though a little wary. 

“You can stop doing that now.” Nick tried again, and for a moment it felt like we were dancing again, like that night on the roof. 

I couldn’t help it; I was drawn to him. 

Nicholas smelled like a vampire. 

No heartbeat. 

No blood. No warmth. I couldn't stop myself, closing the distance between us. I caught his face in my hands and forced my fingers between his lips.

“What the fuck?!” He jolted away, eyes wide. Nicholas was strong, but not as strong as he should be. He shoved me back, and I easily got the upper hand, stabbing at his upper incisors where raw gaping gaps were. Gone. His fangs were gone. 

Ripped out, by the look of each jagged tooth. 

I jumped back, something ice cold sliding down my spine. Nick’s fangs had been purposely taken out. 

My fiancée eventually snapped, twisting my arm, and pinning me to the ground. Already, a crowd was forming around us. 

“Someone call the authorities,” Nick yelled, keeping me pinned to the cold concrete. “This psycho just attacked me!”

“Nick,” I snarled, and his eyes shot open. He crawled back on his knees. 

He wasn’t fighting back. No ignition in his eyes, no curl in his teeth or primed senses, not even a flicker of fight. Nicholas was a full vampire acting exactly like a human.

“Fuck,” he whispered. “It’s a bloodsucker!”

I slapped him, and he drew back, lips parted.

“YOU are a bloodsucker!” I snapped. I grabbed him, yanking him by the collar.

 “Your name is Nicholas Invinia.”

Something flickered across his face, but he quickly. blinked it away. I tightened my grip and pulled him closer, even when he was squirming to get away. 

He reminded me of an animal. No longer the element and charismatic vampire prince, Nicholas resembled a deer caught in headlights. His scent hit me, familiar, but *sterile*. He stunk of antiseptic. 

“You have a birthmark shaped like Italy,” I whispered. “On your thigh.”

My gaze dropped to his arm, where that blinking blue light pulsed under his skin, spiderwebbing down his veins.

Nick violently pulled back like a startled deer, crumpling onto his back. “Get away from me!” 

I didn’t have time to talk to him. Nicolas was already stabbing at his black rectangle. “Hello?” He said, breathlessly, as I staggered back, my heart aching. “Yeah, I’ve got a sighting.” His frenzied eyes flashed across the road. “Downtown. Next to the Apple Store. Can you hurry? This one is crazy!”

I ran. The only place to hide was a narrow alley wedged between a library and what used to be a bookstore. A café sat at the end, empty and quiet.

Behind the counter stood a guy with thick brown hair, a coffee apron slung over jeans and a tee. “We’re closed,” he said flatly.

“I need to hide,” I whispered. “Please. Just behind the counter.”

The barista’s icy gaze didn’t waver. Steam rose from his own coffee, which he took delicate sips of. “I said, we’re *closed*.”

“Five minutes.” I said. “Just let me hide for five minutes!” 

His expression sparked with emotion when I dared step over the threshold. He stepped forward, strangely territorial for a human. “Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is Bean Crave, the most prestigious coffee shop in town. I serve politicians.” 

His gaze reminded me of my judgemental coven. “Not homeless cosplayers.”

I didn’t have time for this.

I rushed forward and pressed my fingers to his temples. He smelled like roasted beans and chocolate. Human. No clinical edge, no antiseptic stink. I’d never tried compulsion before. All it took was a breath in, a breath out, channeling power. 

His eyes flickered, and his arms went limp. A wave of memories washed over me, too blurry to make sense of. I moved carefully, picking my way through his mind. My purpose was to control, not erase. 

His memories held a sickly scent, like rot, like each one was decomposing. 

“Let me hide behind the counter,” I said again, keeping my tone firm. “You didn’t see anything.”

The barista’s head lolled. “I… didn’t see anything,” he repeated.

I pressed again, adding more pressure. “Let me hide.”

His eyes flickered, rolling back and forth. “Yes, maaaaster.”

I hesitated, drawing back when his lip quivered slightly. “Are you mocking me?”

When he didn’t move, I reached toward him again, my fingers brushing his temples, but he caught my wrist in a flash. 

Fast. 

His reflexes were too sharp for a human, and yet he had a heartbeat. 

His grip was firm, his eyes sharp, lips curving. “Standard vampire compulsion,” he said smugly, drawing a gun from his apron and aiming it between my eyes.

1omtzbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1omtzbr/advice_needed/,Advice needed,"Hi everyone,

I was looking for some advice on my symptoms. I’ve always struggled with bloating and constipation that was on and off. I do go everyday but I could feel that at times I needed to go more and was not able to. My diet is mostly whole foods.

Starting October 1st of this year, I became sick with a cold. During this time I was taking Advil Cold and Sinus like I always do. Towards the end of the week, I noticed trapped gas and lots of persistent burping. A few days later, it turned into heart burn and less burps. Then it alternated between heart burn and burping. This obviously concerned me
because it was so distressing so I connected with a Naturopath here in Vancouver.

She put me on DGL Licorce Root, Slippery Elm, and L glutamine in the event that the Advil affected my stomach lining. She also put me on mastic gum which actually got rid of my heart burn but the burping came back.

I did see my family doctor and they tried putting me on a PPI but I did not take them. They put me on a H2 blocker and Gavicson also made no difference.

I also got tested for H. Pylori which was negative, but I will be re testing in a few weeks to confirm it was not a false negative.

Now its been about 3-4 weeks of being on a whole foods, low acidic foods diet, and the persistent burping is very noticeable as well as the gas. I notice a lot of gas in the morning as well. I have a bowel movement every morning, but not during the day as well like I used to since I cut out things like peppermint tea, pineapple, etc. I do still have a cup of coffee in the morning so I can have a bowel movement.

My naturopath thinks it might be Sibo because after taking the mastic gum my burping increased. I do bloat but not an insane amount. I’m waiting on the kit to come and get tested.

My current symptoms are burping, bloating, and occasional stomach burning.

Has anyone had burping and excessive gas as there only symptom and had sibo or gastritis? Any advice?",1,1762120183.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False
1omtvom,https://i.redd.it/l88o3de9zwyf1.jpeg,Pumpkin Pie Mug Cake / Muffin,"Thanks to u/zeebrio for the original link to the mug cake recipe.

https://smilebecause.com/keto-mug-bread/

I tinkered with it and came up with a pumpkin pie recipe and it came out good. 

Some of this you're going to have to eyeball depending on your taste. 

**First a warning about pumpkin spice**

I bought a batch from Frontier Co-op and it was heavy with clove it overpowered everything I had to add additional cinnamon and nutmeg to neutralize it. I've ran into a lot of inconsistencies with different all natural pumpkin spice blends. 

This recipe can be made in a large ceramic coffee mug. I would use at least a 20 oz mug or ramekin because it does puff up especially if you are using egg whites.

I prefer to make this recipe in a small bowl and then pour into the mug because the molasses will clump up.

**Ingredients**

* 1 large egg or 4 tbsp egg whites (room temperature).
* 1.5 tbsp salted butter or neutral oil like avocado oil (if using oil or unsalted butter add a pinch of salt).
* 1/2 tsp baking powder.
* 3 tbsp almond flour (can use a little more if you want it drier).
* 1+ tbsp brown sugar substitute (I used roughly 1.5 tablespoons allulose + 1/4 tsp molasses).
* 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (use more or less to taste) 
* 1+ tbsp pumpkin puree (I used one huge heaping tablespoon).

**Optional**

* A couple of drops of vanilla extract into the batter. 

**Optional Topping**

* Keto icing

**Preparation**

1. Melt butter in a microwave and add to a small mixing bowl (If using oil, add oil and a pinch of salt to a small mixing bowl. If using unsalted butter melt the butter add it to the bowl with a pinch of salt).

2. If using butter let cool for a few minutes. 

3. Add egg or egg whites and start mixing it together (if you're planning on using molasses you might need a whisk).

4. Add pumpkin puree and keep mixing.

5. Add brown sugar substitute for molasses blend and keep mixing. 

6. And the rest of the ingredients one at a time starting with the baking powder while mixing. 

7. Pour into your ramekin or coffee mug. 

8. Let it rest a couple of minutes. 

9. Microwave on high at least 75 seconds (1100 watt microwave). 75 seconds will give you a very soft moist cake like texture. 90 seconds will give you a firm muffin like texture. I did it for 75 seconds.

10. Carefully remove the coffee mug or ramekin from the microwave let it set for a couple of minutes to cool and then pop it out if it's moist on the bottom flip it over so it's bottom side up and it will continue to firm up as it cools.

Breakfast - the usual porridge, my new fancy Manuka honey, with soya milk alongside yogurt and berries and my coffee with sugar 10/10

Snack - sourdough, butter and ham 10/10 (I forgot how much I love this combo!)

Lunch - chicken salad sourdough sandwich with MAYO! lentil crisps, tomatoes and an un-pictured orange 8/10

Snack - M&S shortbread trees with a cuppa 9/10

Dinner - My fav double salmon, rice and broccoli with soy sauce and I challenged myself to add some mayo (this was hard, brain was freaking out but I did it) 10/10

Dessert - sea salt gelato with sprinkles 10/10 (dad had a coffee icecream too)

Extra - sweets, chocolate and salty cashews (anxiety was high during this, my brain convinced me I didn't need it and I didn't enjoy it, I need to stop hoarding energy until the end of the day because then this happens) 7/10

Snack - cornflakes, soya milk with yogurt and fruit! 10/10

Brain was loud today, particularly surrounding me eating too much and body changes. Also hunger was high and I feel like I didn't properly listen to it which annoyed me because I am getting into the habit of saving my energy until the end of the day to 'allow' for treats - I don't want this to become a habit so gonna nip it in the bud asap. my body needs fuel throughout the day! If you also see my previous post, my brain is convincing me I better now and convincing me to eat less but - I AM NOT LISTENING, I have come to far!

Tomorrow is a fresh week. I want to meet my energy needs fully, challenge myself even more and push through these ED thoughts! Today I got a little hung up on energy intake and let it influence me more than I would like because it only left me shorter of my intake than I had been the past few days. So whilst I know roughly what I am eating energy wise, I need to stop focusing on it as much and trying to hoard it for the evenings. I can eat what I enjoy, to the plan, allow extras, allow challenges, allow treats and stop trying to control it too much! If I am hungry I can eat. At the end of the day I need to remember more is better than less no matter what the ED says! Hope you all are well!

So yeah… dating apps seems too superficial.I do go to social events and try different hobbies, but it often feels like a weird pressure zone - everyone trying their luck, and I’m just not great with small talk or “approaching.” :(  Thought to give Reddit a shot.

Would be nice to meet someone to hang out with

grab a coffee,  
go for a walk 🚶‍♂️,  
dance 💃,  
or a movie  
or just see where things go.

No pressure, but open to something meaningful even if we vibe as a friend

Lately I’ve been feeling a bit lonely and a bit lost, which is new feeling. I’ve always had good friends around, but I guess life has shifted a bit, and I’m just trying to put myself out there again.

**About me:**  
\-  An average male in his Early thirties, ambivert, considered tall and slim  
\-  Into sports, nature, psychology, and those deep convos that jump from “what’s your favorite movie” to “what’s the meaning of life?” in 10 mins :)  
\-  Don’t smoke or do drugs, social drinker (just recently started enjoying a glass of wine or a beer once in a while)  
\- Like to dance, learn new things, and stay somewhat fit and athletic (definitely not a calisthenics guy though 😅)  
\- Into spirituality, and an occasional reader

💭 Been rebuilding my confidence after a tough few months - lots of introspection and growth happening lately

**Pros of dating (or befriending) me** 😅

empathetic, good listener, positive mindset, can (sometimes) do an impressive cook, foodie and love to make people feel comfortable. I enjoy going to clubs occasionally — mainly to dance, not to “party hard”

**Cons:**  
\- Hopeless over thinker, procrastinator with a touch of FOMO  
\- Friendly in groups, but prefer connecting 1:1 or in small groups  
\- Not the funniest guy in the room — I’m more of a “smile and listen” type 😅

Currently working on fitness, career, and becoming more confident with public speaking and expressing myself.

**Looking for:**  
Someone who is kind, empathetic, care about nature, animals, and others in general. Open-minded, positive people who are up for a chat, a walk, a coffee, or maybe even a spontaneous adventure :-D

this may be a long post…..
When i was a kid my sister started a business and i was rarely in school for one reason or another from being so i cold barely functioning to skipping school due to extreme bullying. 
So my sister thought it would be a good idea to “teach me a good work ethic” by forcing me to work for her business with out pay mind you an at the ripe age of 10. I could be so sick  throwing up or coughing up a lung but she didn’t care she would say i was faking for attention. When i turned 16 she finally started to pay me and because it’s hard to find a job in my area i and i didn’t really have many options so i just stuck with it. Through the years things just kept getting worse and worse. She would scream at me about the smallest mistakes make me work god offer jobs and give me fue days off. My grades got so bad the school wanted me to repeat my senior year and i ended up dropping out. When I turned 18 I tried to find another job in town and i found one working for our local paper it was simple but for once peaceful. Not for long tho my sister through a fit saying i abandoned her and she couldn’t run the business alone and when that didn’t work she started showing up making a mess at my work and I ended up getting fired. I had no choice at the time but to go back to work for my sister. Shortly after i had the opportunity threw job corps to work for a local coffee shop and get my ged at the same time so i jumped on the opportunity. Not long after did my sister start showing up and complaining how horrible everything was at the shop and that it was a bad look for me.. i lived working there as short lived as it was it was a nice place and i met so many kind people there. But once again i was back at the merci of my sister….. some years went buy and things did improve a bit and i was making good money. Then covid hit and everything hit the fan again. My sister ended up using the business credit card to buy groceries because we had nothing. It was a very hard fue years and we finally got back on track but my sister ended up with a habit of using the business credit card for everything but the business……then came the loans to fix the debit but there was still the loans to pay. 
Then my sister was approved for 2 more loans but she said I should take the money and we could take the payments out of my checks. 
Wicth was great at the time i payed the first loan off in 6 months it was only around 2000 so without thinking i took the second one and bought a camper trailer and moved out of my dads house finally. But once again I got knocked off my feet.. 
the second loan was barley moving after 2 years of paying for it and i was paying more and more out of my checks to try and get it payed and my sister started getting more and more abusive to the point she was screaming at me in clients houses and slapping me around in the Car on the way home. 
I ended up leaving the business for good and my boyfriend got me a job at the truck stop he works at as a cashier. I was still trying to pay off my loan but my sister ended up  takeing almost my hole check every week for the payments in a months time i had given her over $1500 but my loan hadn’t moved at all… i ended up confronting her about it and she said it wasn’t going down because of interest but how could it be so high that all the money i had given her over 2 years and not move at all. My loan started at $7000 and I’m not sure how much of my money really went to paying it or if it was ever payed. And on top of that my sister decided i needed to help pay the credit card bills in total she wanted 80 percent of my check to pay my loan and another 500 every month for the card. She had been takeing almost all of my check in the first place and now wanted money i would never have.i ended up loosing the lot i had my trailer parked at because i had no money to pay my rent  but thankfully my boyfriend came and moved my trailer to his house and i now live with him. I honestly don’t know where  would be with out him. After we moved my trailer i told my sister I wasn’t going to give her another dime the loans not in my name and she couldn’t force any more out of me i had nothing left to give her and i blocked her.she came by my work looking for me when I wasn’t there and threw a fit then peeled out of the parking lot when i came into work my boss was mad but after I explained everything she told me i could have her trespassed if she came back. I haven’t seen or spoke to my sister since its been almost a year now and things have been so good me and my boyfriend bought a mobile home together it needs work but i think we can Handel it. The only thing that bothers me is i don’t know if i did the right thing or not…
I know she can’t possibly pay anything off and that she’s not doing great mean while everything has fallen perfectly into place for me.
I don’t think i can forgive her for everything but I don’t wish harm on her either …. But if i try to help her everything will just go back to how it was…",1,1762119676.0,venting,2,0.99,False

1omtn8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1omtn8r/handprints/,Handprints,"The morning was still as a held breath.

Cold clung to the porch railings and silvered the grass. Mist hung low, pooling in the hollows of the yard and drifting like smoke across the street, where the trees stood black and bare, their limbs tangled like old wire.

I slung my work bag over one shoulder and locked the front door behind me. I wore a flannel overshirt and heavy boots, but the chill still found the skin at my neck. The air smelled of wet leaves and something faintly metallic.

I stepped off the porch and paused.

There, in the patch of mud beside the gravel drive, were tracks. Not boot prints. Not paws. Not anything I could name.

They were long, narrow impressions—like the heel of a hand pressed deep into the earth, fingers splayed. But there were no matching footprints. Just those strange palm-shaped marks, staggered and dragging slightly, as if whatever made them had pulled itself forward on its hands alone.

I crouched, frowning. The soil was soft from last night’s rain, and the prints were fresh. I reached out, almost touched one, then thought better of it.

A flicker of movement caught my eye.

Across the street, just beyond the mist, something pale lay at the edge of the woods. I squinted. It looked like a chicken—limp, wings askew, neck twisted at an unnatural angle. One of ours?

I stood slowly, heart beginning to thud.

The coop was behind the house, fenced and latched. Jules and I had built it ourselves last spring, after I got laid off. It was sturdy. Safe.

I turned on my heel and walked fast around the side of the house, boots crunching frostbitten grass. The coop door hung open. The latch dangled, unbroken.

Inside, feathers. Scattered like torn paper. And in the corner, a smear of something dark.

One hen missing. The rest huddled silent, wide-eyed.

I backed away, breath clouding in the air. I looked toward the trees again, but the mist had thickened. The shape was gone.

I stood for a long moment, staring into the mist where it had been. The trees across the street loomed quiet and still, their trunks swallowed by fog.

I closed the coop gently, checked the latch twice. The remaining hens rustled behind me, feathers puffed and silent.

Inside the house, warmth met me like a blanket. The radiator hummed. One of the cats—Moss—wound around my ankles, purring. The others were curled in their usual places: on the windowsill, the armchair, the folded laundry. I counted them without thinking. Five. All accounted for.

I stepped softly into the bedroom. Jules lay curled on her side, one arm tucked under her cheek, hair fanned across the pillow. I leaned down and kissed her temple, lingering just a moment. She stirred but didn’t wake.

I dressed quietly, poured coffee into a thermos, and left for work.

***…***

The office was a converted house on the edge of town, pale green siding and a crooked porch. I worked for the county’s Parks and Trails department—mostly maintenance, sometimes signage, sometimes trail clearing. It was quiet work, and I liked it that way.

But today, I couldn’t focus.

I kept thinking about the prints. The way they dragged. The way they looked like hands.

And the chicken. That pale shape in the mist. It had been there. I was sure of it. But when I looked again, it was gone.

Around ten, my phone buzzed.

**Jules**:  
Did you say one of the chickens was *missing*?

I stared at the screen, thumb hovering.

**Me**:  
Yeah. Coop door was open. One gone.  
Weird tracks in the mud. Like handprints.  
Thought I saw a dead one across the street.  
It disappeared.

Three dots blinked. Then stopped.

**Jules**:  
That’s… weird.

**Me**:  
I know.

I looked out the office window. Mist still clung to the trees behind the building. The same kind of trees. The same kind of quiet.

Ray walked in and dropped a clipboard on the desk. “You good?” he asked.

I nodded. “Just tired.”

But my eyes kept drifting to the woods.

…

By noon, the mist had burned off, but the cold lingered. I was in the garage, strapping my pack to the back of the ATV when Ray came in, rubbing his hands together like he could will warmth into them.

“Trail 9’s yours today,” he said. “Storm last week knocked some limbs down, and we’ve had a couple hikers complain. Nothing major, just messy.”

I nodded, tightening the last strap.

Ray hesitated. “Also… someone reported an abandoned campsite out past the ridge. Way off trail. Said it looked weird. Like someone left in a hurry.”

I raised an eyebrow. “You want me to check it out?”

“Yeah. Just make sure no one’s hurt or squatting out there. Shouldn’t take long. You’ll be back before dark.”

I didn’t say anything, just waited.

He scratched his beard. “I know it’s a stretch, but with all the missing pets this year… I don’t know. Feels off. Cats, dogs, even a goat from that farm on 42. Just gone.”

I frowned. “You think it’s connected?”

“I think I don’t like coincidences,” he said. “And we’re short-staffed. You’re the only one I trust to handle it solo.”

I gave a short nod, swung my leg over the ATV, and started the engine.

…

The trail was easy. A few downed branches, some erosion near the switchback, but nothing I couldn’t clear with a handsaw and a little muscle. The woods were quiet—too quiet. No birdsong. No wind. Just the hum of the engine and the crunch of tires over frost-hardened dirt.

I found the campsite just past the ridge, tucked in a hollow near a dry creek bed.

At first glance, it looked like someone had left in a hurry. A tent collapsed on one side. A camp chair overturned. A cooler cracked open, contents spilled and half-frozen.

Then I saw the tracks.

Same as the ones by my driveway that morning—long, narrow handprints, fingers splayed, dragging through the mud. They were everywhere. Around the firepit. Across the flattened tent. Leading into the woods and back again, like something had circled the site over and over.

It didn’t look abandoned. It looked destroyed.

My stomach turned. Every instinct screamed that I shouldn’t be here. Not alone.

My hand went to my hip, to the spot where I used to carry a sidearm. But that had been a point of contention—too aggressive, Ray had said. Too much, for someone with my “presence.” Now all I had was the hunting knife strapped to my thigh.

I sighed, low and bitter, and backed away from the site.

The sun was already starting to dip behind the trees. Shadows stretched long across the forest floor. I climbed back onto the ATV and turned it toward the trailhead.

…

The ride back was slower. The air felt heavier. The woods too still.

Then I heard it—faint, far off. A sound like footsteps, but wrong. Not boots. Not hooves. Something uneven. Wet. Like hands slapping the ground.

I stopped the ATV and listened.

Nothing.

I started moving again, faster now, eyes flicking to the trees.

Then came the cry.

It echoed through the forest—long, low, and mournful. Not human. Not animal. Something in between. It made my skin crawl.

The ATV sputtered.

I cursed, tapped the throttle. The engine coughed, then died.

“Well fuck,” I muttered, climbing off.

The forest was silent again. Too silent.

I slung my pack over my shoulder, tightened my grip on the knife, and started walking.

The woods were darker now. The sun had slipped behind the hills, and the trees stood like sentinels, black against the bruised sky.

I walked fast, boots crunching frostbitten leaves. My breath came in short bursts, fogging the air. The knife in my hand felt small. Insufficient.

Behind me, the sounds continued.

Not footsteps. Not exactly.

A wet, slapping rhythm. Uneven. Like something dragging itself forward. Like hands.

I didn’t look back.

I knew better.

The trail curved, and I saw the faint glow of the office porch light through the trees. Relief surged—but it was thin, brittle.

The sounds grew louder.

I stopped.

The forest was silent again. No wind. No birds. Just the thud of my heart.

Then the cry came.

A long, low wail—mournful and wrong. It echoed through the trees, vibrating in my chest.

The hairs on my neck rose.

I turned.

Just for a second.

In the dark, between the trunks, I saw it.

A pale figure—white, torn, hunched low to the ground. It moved in a way that defied sense, limbs bent wrong, head lolling. It didn’t walk. It didn’t crawl. It propelled itself, jerking forward like a puppet with tangled strings.

I gasped and ran.

I sprinted the last stretch, knife clutched tight, lungs burning. I burst through the office door and slammed it shut, locking it.

Ray stood from his desk, startled. “Jesus, Hollis—what happened?”

I leaned against the wall, panting.

“There’s something out there,” I said.

Ray stared at me. “What kind of something?”

I shook my head. “I don’t know. But I’m bringing my sidearm from now on.”

Ray nodded slowly.

We didn’t speak much after that. Just packed up in silence, checked the windows, and stepped out into the cold together. I scanned the tree line as we walked to our trucks.

The woods watched back.

…

By the time I pulled into the driveway, the sky was ink-black and the mist had returned, curling low around the porch steps. The house lights glowed warm through the windows. I sat in the truck for a moment, gripping the wheel, before finally stepping out.

Inside, the smell of mushrooms and thyme wrapped around me like a blanket. Jules stood at the stove, ladling soup into two bowls. Her beautiful pink hair was pulled into a loose bun, wisps curling around her face in the steam. She turned when I came in, her eyes narrowing.

“You’re late,” she said gently. “And you look like hell.”

I dropped my bag by the door and kicked off my boots. “I’m fine.”

She raised an eyebrow.

We sat at the kitchen table, the cats weaving between our legs. I wrapped my hands around the warm bowl, but didn’t eat.

Jules waited.

Finally, I spoke. “I saw something. Out past Trail 9. A wrecked campsite. Same tracks I saw this morning—like handprints, dragging through the mud. And then… something followed me back. I heard it. I saw it.”

She didn’t interrupt. Just listened, her spoon paused halfway to her mouth.

“It was pale,” I said. “Torn up. Moving wrong. Like it didn’t have legs. Like it was pulling itself.”

The silence stretched.

Jules set her spoon down and leaned back in her chair, eyes distant. “You said it moved on its hands?”

I nodded.

She stood abruptly and left the room. I heard the soft clack of keys from the office down the hall, the creak of the old desk chair. I stayed at the table, staring into my soup, the warmth of the house suddenly feeling fragile.

When Jules returned, she was holding a thin folder and a printout. Her face was pale.

“I think I know what you saw,” she said.

I looked up.

“There’s an old story,” Jules began, sitting down again. “Not something people talk about anymore. Not in town. Not even in the library archives unless you know where to look.”

She slid the paper across the table.

“Her name was Maribeth \[redacted\]. Lived up in the hills, near where Trail 9 runs now. She was a healer, a midwife, and by all accounts, a good woman. Helped folks who couldn’t afford doctors. Took in strays. Kept to herself.”

Jules hesitated.

“Then there was an accident. No one knows exactly what happened. Some say she was attacked. Others say she fell into a ravine. But she was broken after that. Couldn’t walk upright. Moved on her hands, dragging her body behind her.”

My stomach twisted.

“They say the town turned on her,” Jules continued. “Called her cursed. Said she brought sickness. Said she was unnatural. She lived the rest of her life alone in the woods. Died out there, too. Some say she never left.”

She looked at me carefully.

“There’s more. People say her ghost doesn’t just haunt the woods. It… attaches. To people. Picks someone. Follows them. Watches. And once it’s chosen you, it doesn’t stop.”

I stared at the paper. A grainy photo of a woman with tired eyes and a crooked smile. The caption read: *Maribeth \[redacted\], 1932.*

“No one says her name anymore,” Jules said softly. “Not around here. Folks are too superstitious. They just call her ‘the thing in the trees.’”

I looked at her. “You believe this?”

She didn’t answer right away. Then: “I believe you saw something. And I believe this place remembers pain.”

Outside, the wind picked up. The porch creaked.

I reached for Jules’s hand.

…

The next morning, Jules was quiet. She made coffee, fed the cats, and sat at the table with her laptop open. I watched her from the doorway.

“You okay?” I asked.

She didn’t look up. “I found something else.”

I stepped closer.

“There’s a pattern,” Jules said. “Every few decades. Someone sees it. Feels it. Starts hearing things. Then they disappear.”

My throat tightened. “Disappear how?”

“No one knows. They just… vanish. Sometimes their animals go first. Sometimes their partners. But it always starts with the tracks.”

She turned the laptop toward me. A scanned newspaper clipping. *Local Woman Missing After Strange Reports in Woods.*

The photo was grainy. But I recognized the woman’s eyes. Wide. Haunted.

“She said it followed her,” Jules whispered. “Said she felt it watching. Said she dreamed about it.”

I stepped back.

“I think it’s chosen you,” Jules said.

…

That night, the house felt wrong.

The radiator hissed too loud. The cats wouldn’t settle. One by one, they slunk into the bedroom, ears flat, tails puffed. I sat on the edge of the bed, lacing my boots.

I’d already pulled the water gun from the hall closet—bright green plastic, filled with holy water from a dusty bottle labeled *St. Jude’s, 2009*. A relic from my ghost-hunting days, back when I thought hauntings were stories and salt was just seasoning.

Jules stood in the doorway, pale and silent, holding a flashlight in one hand and a box of rock salt in the other.

We didn’t speak.

Then the porch creaked.

The cats hissed in unison, backing into corners, fur bristling.

A low scraping sound moved along the siding. Then the unmistakable sound of something climbing—slow, deliberate, unnatural.

I stepped into the hallway just as the living room window slid open with a soft click.

It came through.

Twisted. Pale. Its skin hung in tatters, like wet paper clinging to bone. Its arms were too long, elbows bent backward, fingers splayed like broken twigs. It moved on its hands, dragging the rest of its body behind, spine arching and collapsing with each lurch.  Its face was a ruin—half collapsed, half grinning. One eye socket empty. The other wide and gleaming.

It turned toward Jules.

She froze, flashlight trembling in her grip.

The creature crept closer, its breath rattling like wind through dead leaves.

The cats shrieked and scattered.

“Hey,” I said.

The thing stopped.

Its head twisted toward me, neck cracking. That grin widened, impossibly.

“I know you’re here for me,” I said, voice steady. “You picked me.”

It stared.

“I know what they did to you,” I said. “I know what it’s like to be twisted by other people’s fear. To be hated for how you move through the world.”

The leer faltered.

“But I’m not afraid of you,” I said. “And you don’t get to have me.”

I nodded once.

Jules raised the water gun and fired.

The stream hit the creature square in the chest. It screamed—a sound like metal tearing, like wind howling through a broken throat. Its body convulsed, limbs flailing, skin blistering where the water touched.

It scrambled backward, shrieking, and hurled itself through the open window, vanishing into the night with a final, echoing wail.

Silence fell.

The cats crept back in, wide-eyed but unharmed.

Jules and I stood in the center of the room, breathing hard.

Then she said, “Salt?”

“Salt,” I confirmed.

We worked in silence, pouring a ring around the house, every window, every door. The night air was sharp, but the stars were clear.

When we finished, we stood on the porch, side by side.

Jules looked at me. “You okay?”

I nodded. “She picked the wrong bitch.”

She smiled, tired and fierce. “Damn right she did.”

1omtjfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1omtjfa/the_night_my_dog_forgot_how_to/,The Night My Dog Forgot How to,"If you want a reason to keep your dog on a leash even when you’re miles from anyone, here’s mine.

I took Boone—four-year-old cattle dog with the posture of a retired sergeant—into the Broken Birch backcountry the first weekend of October. I don’t live to court danger. I’m not one of those “vanlife, but with frostbite” guys. I just needed out. The city had been a bowl someone kept tapping with a spoon: sirens, neighbors’ arguments through the vent, my phone buzzing itself hot with group chats I never asked to be in. Boone knew it too. He’d stand at the door when I put my boots on and breathe this theatrical sigh. Somewhere along the way we started understanding each other better than most people I’ve dated.

I did it right. Left the itinerary taped to my kitchen counter. Texted coordinates to my sister, who hates camping but loves reasons to worry. Charged the Garmin inReach, checked the weather twice, brought a first aid kit that could patch drywall. I picked a loop that starts at an old forest service road near the township line and climbs two ridges with a shallow saddle in the middle. Seven miles the first day, five the second, with a camp somewhere in the saddle. Creek water cold and clean this time of year, poplars yellowing, mosquitoes already bored with us.
At the trailhead the sun-faded carsonite post still read “FR 221 — GATE 9” in black stick-on letters, the kind you only ever see on USFS signs.

There’s a CCC-era foundation there—just waist-high stone rectangles like molars sticking out of the ground. I’d camped near it once years ago. It always felt like leaving your tent beside an empty parking lot: familiar but not quite comforting. On a map it’s unremarkable. In person it has the vibe of a forgotten porch. I don’t have better words for it.

We started at noon under a sky the exact gray of wet concrete. The lot was empty except for a rusted horse trailer and a styrofoam coffee cup caught on a spear of goldenrod. I clipped Boone’s collar—the good one with the orange GPS puck—and he pressed his shoulder into my thigh like, hurry up, you’ve been talking about this all week.

The first miles were just us and the zipper of boots on frost-curled leaves. Boone takes point like a soldier, head low, ears rotating. Every twenty yards he checks back, and if I’m too slow he stops and looks wounded until I catch up. If there’s a person on the trail, he sits to the side, immaculate manners. If there’s a chipmunk, he pretends he didn’t see it like a gentleman.

About two hours in, we crossed a creek that had braided itself into three shallow channels. The rocks there look like something simmered them. Every step felt like dipping a toe into a dentist’s tray. Coming up the far bank, Boone did something he doesn’t do: he froze and stared at nothing.

Not the alert, not the point, not the goof where he pretends the breeze is an intruder. He went still the way a bird goes still when a shadow crosses it. One paw up, one paw down. Neck extended. His mouth closed and stayed closed. The hair on his spine lifted in a harbor wave.

“What?” I said, because you always say what even though the dog can’t answer.

He didn’t look at me. He didn’t sniff. He didn’t do the polite little head tilt that means squirrel. He just stared into a clump of young firs like there was a TV screen hidden in there and the show was about him.

Maybe forty seconds passed that felt like someone had dropped a dome over us. I didn’t hear the creek anymore. I didn’t hear birds. There was a mosquito hovering near my wrist and I couldn’t hear that, either. When sound came back it felt like a door unlatched somewhere—you probably know that sensation from losing power in your house and then the refrigerator kicks back on and you realize there had been a hum the whole time.

Boone’s paw set down. He looked back at me. Blinked. Shook off like he’d stepped out of rain, and then he pulled himself together so hard it was almost mannered: a quick head rub against my hip, a wag exactly four beats long, and we walked on.

“Deer,” I told myself, or maybe a feral hog, even though I haven’t seen one this far north and I don’t want to. “Probably a deer.”

It bothered me that my brain offered “deer” like a polite suggestion, not a conviction. I’ve seen enough deer to know the texture of deer in the air—the wet mulch scent, the sudden whicker, the wood-on-wood click of a hoof that isn’t careful. Whatever Boone had stared at had the texture of nothing. If I waved my arm into it, I had the sense it would disappear around my elbow and come back sticky.

We reached the saddle around four. The CCC foundation had collected a shallow drift of leaves inside it like someone had tried to pour autumn and it slopped. The stone was damp in stripes where the sun lost interest. A pair of old square nails lay beside one corner like a present. Boone did his perimeter trot. I set the tent in the lee of the highest wall, near a birch that had lived long enough to twist itself into a question mark. The ground there is rooty but dry. The creek is twenty yards down and the water runs cold enough to bite the finger pads. Someone had left a pile of firewood the way good people do, tucked under a rotting plank so it was mostly dry.

I strung a bear line and hung our food—two dry bags that made me feel virtuous and clumsy at the same time. I’m not naive enough to think any of it stops a determined animal, but it slows the opportunistic ones, and I’ve met more raccoons with PhDs than I have bears in this forest.
I tied a trucker’s hitch—no, that’s not right; it was a panicky clove hitch with an extra half-hitch because my hands wouldn’t stop being hands.

By dusk, dinner steamed in a metal bowl and smelled like someone had bribed beans to pretend to be chili. Boone ate half his kibble and then leaned closer to the tent than he normally would, like he wanted to be touching it while he chewed. When I sat, he moved so his thigh pressed my boot. You collect little data points about your dog without realizing it: how far his nose goes into the bowl, how he lifts his head at the same point in every meal like he’s saying grace. All those tiny habits were half a degree off. Nothing anyone else would notice. Enough for me to feel like the campsite was vastly crowded by something that had arrived early and taken the good chair.

When the dark actually came, it came quick. The clouds had thickened, so the sky didn’t bother with a sunset. One moment the birch had definition, and the next it was a sketch in charcoal. I got a fire going that hissed like a mild argument and added a piece of birch that caught well and smell-cleaned the air. The creek seemed to adjust to the fire’s volume and sounded louder in response, like a person you’re trying to talk over.

I wear a headlamp that has a red mode so you can keep your night sight. If you’ve never used one, red turns the immediate world into a basement darkroom—edges without glare, a sense of time paused. I use it in camp because it helps you see beyond what you’re doing. White light makes a wall. Red light makes a bubble. You want a bubble in the woods at night, not a wall.

The first odd noise wasn’t odd. It was a footfall. You can tell a lot by footfalls. Two feet, four feet, confident or hesitant, heavy or draggy. This one was measured and wrong. Wrong in the way a metronome sounds wrong if you’ve only ever listened to human music. Too even. No stumbles. No little staccato adjustments. From the treeline to our flame, step, step, step, and stop. Then nothing.

Boone raised his head slowly. He did not make a sound. His whole body made itself long: neck extended, ears flat, chest resting between his paws, eyes as round as a picture of eyes. His mouth stayed closed. Dogs are a mouth species. They breathe truth out of it. When Boone keeps his mouth closed, he is pretending he is not a dog.

“Hello?” I said before I could catch the word. A shameful word in a dark forest. Hello is a city word, a doorbell word. It marks you as someone who believes conversation solves most things.

Nothing moved. The fire popped and sent up one spark that died at eye level like a tiny planet lost interest in being bright.

There was a sound I took a moment to name because I had never heard it in the woods at night: the jingle of metal tags. Leash tags. The exact rhythm of Boone’s—two rings and a rabies chip, a specific three-note clink I could recognize across a dog park. Boone’s head whipped toward the sound, then back to me. He wasn’t wearing them. I’d taken them off earlier to clean the mud from under the split ring, set them on the tent’s vestibule mat, and then, distracted, forgotten to put them back on. The little pile of metal was seven inches from my boot.

The jingle came again. Identical rhythm. Not close—somewhere back in the trees, maybe twenty yards out, exactly where the line between firelight and forest began. Then it stopped on a dime, and the silence that came after it felt like a mouth closed too carefully.

I told myself I was hearing a buck’s antlers brushing a branch. People do that all the time. There are jokes about it. “Ghost bells” that turn into a buck in November. You want it to be that. You want it to be anything with a heart you can point at and count.

“Boone,” I said, quiet. He’d shifted, his shoulder now pressed against my boot hard enough for bone to know it. The red of my headlamp turned his eyes into black holes that smoked lightly.

Step. Step. Step.

It came from a different angle now, forty-five degrees to the left, but with the same metronome precision. No branch snap. No leaf hiss. The steps sounded like someone pressing a boot into damp cardboard. Then the tags again—one-two-three, with the exact pause in the middle where Boone’s two rings sometimes knock against each other.

“Who’s there?” I asked before I could stop it.

“Who’s there?” came back, in my own voice, from the dark.

There are parlor tricks in the woods. Owls can do a passable human whistle. Foxes have a bark that sounds like a child trying not to cry. I’ve heard coyotes make a noise that convinced me a woman needed help until I found the tracks. But hearing your own voice come back at you from a stand of black spruce—that eats a chunk out of your mind and you don’t realize how big the chunk is until later.

Boone stood. Not a muscle twitch. He simply collected himself and stood the way a kid stands when a stranger says his name from a white van. He leaned into me so hard I had to put a hand on the tent to keep from tipping.

“You have to go,” my voice said from the trees, conversational and flat, as if it had been waiting to enter at that line in the script.

I stood too fast and kicked my spoon into the fire. My headlamp went wild and turned the nearest trunks into sudden red bones. The dark beyond them looked oiled.

“Not funny,” I said, which was nothing and made me feel like a twelve-year-old resisting a dare.

“Not funny,” my voice agreed from the black, slightly closer, and in the wrong cadence—like it had arranged the words by height, not meaning.

The fire must have cracked in that exact second, because the forest flickered, and for a fraction of a blink, the space between two firs went from a painting to a window. There was something tall in it—not tall like a tree, tall like a person standing on a stump trying on the idea of “taller.” The outline clicked off my retina the way lightning does, and what remained when my eyes caught up was more upsetting than the shape had been: a clean emptiness exactly where something had been.

Boone’s mouth opened. No bark came out.

He tried. I watched his ribs spread, watched the cords of his neck lift, saw him build a sound from belly to throat and then—nothing. It was like a film cut. Like the projectionist had taken scissors to the frame where noise should occur. His jaw moved. His body spoke. The part you hear did not exist.

The jingle came again. One-two-three. Closer.

Everything inside me went very tidy. Panic is messy. Whatever was moving through the trees didn’t leave me room for that. It felt like trying to play chess with someone who had already touched all your pieces earlier in the day and learned their weight. There’s a clarity to it that is not courage.

I took Boone’s collar from the tent mat and looped it onto him in the red light. He took it the way he takes vet visits—trusting and insulted at once. I slipped the paracord line from my bear hang into a triangle around our camp, knee-high, tied off at three trees, an ugly tripwire covered in leaves. I scavenged a dozen old spoons and a pot from the fire grate and hung them near the tent door like a sad wind chime. If it was human, it would laugh. If it was an animal, it would either not care or care too late. I don’t know what I hoped from a third category.

“You have to go,” the trees said, this time with a wetness to it, like they were shaping my voice around a mouth not made for it.

I thought about using the inReach. I didn’t. The nearest fire road gate is two miles off that saddle and is usually locked. Rangers have to coordinate to get out here. I didn’t want to pin my night to a maybe. Besides, there’s a small stubborn part of me that wanted to keep the thing that used my voice from knowing I could ask for help. It is hard to admit how childlike that reasoning was.

“Leave,” I said, for me, not it.

“Leave,” it said back, and then something moved behind the firs in a way that made less sense than the words had: a smooth roll followed by too many short adjustments, like a horse trying to learn stairs.

I reached for the bear spray and for once I didn’t hate its pink cap and the little “deterrent” euphemism on the label. Boone moved exactly where he’s been trained to with the word “center”—between my legs, facing out. He has only ever done that in our hallway as a game. He did it now with a grimness I will never forget. The leash went taut, and the leather creaked like teeth.

When it finally breached the edge of the light, it came in parts. First the tags—shiny, swinging, catching firelight, except not Boone’s. Not any dog’s. A bunch of them. Maybe a dozen, hung on a length of cord I didn’t want to examine. Different shapes. Different silvers. The flashing map of lost dogs.

Then a shoulder, naked of fur but colored like fur, as if someone had painted an arm and then smudged it with soil where the elbow should be. It stepped over the paracord without looking like it knew where it was. It did not trip the spoons. It did not hurry. It came like someone entering a room they have owned forever and are surprised to find you in.

I could not tell you the shape of its head. The red light turned edges into lies. It was lower than it should have been and too still. If you told me it was wearing a deer skull I’d call you dramatic. If you told me it was wearing nothing I’d call you wrong. It had the suggestion of ears in the wrong place. It had the idea of a snout without the engineering. The tags swung and clicked their three-beat jingle.

Boone pressed so hard into my shins that my knees popped. He tried to bark again and failed, again, and the effort made a wet click in his throat that I still hear when I do dishes. I think—this part is me thinking—that whatever it was had worn a dog’s sound recently enough to be wearing some of that dog still. I don’t have proof. I have the way Boone’s voice went missing and the way the tags flashed like fish answering a net.

I had a road flare in my kit. People argue about them. They’re heavy, they’re overkill, they’re not Leave No Trace. I carry one for exactly two reasons: signal if I break an ankle, and last resort if something with a brain decides I am decor. I cracked it with my thumbnail and cowardice, and it burned to life like a small piece of savagery, white-red and furious.

Whatever had come to my camp moved back fast enough to skid leaves with that wet-folder sound. The flare light doesn’t throw a lot of width, but it throws intensity. In that burn, I saw a leg wrong. Not wrong as in broken. Wrong as in built by a list that had two lists under it. Something had copied the idea of a knee and then given up half an inch before it was finished. It bent in a way you know immediately would fail under weight if the world were fair. There were deep lines in the skin—not wrinkles, not furrows. More like seams where something had decided to try on a different way of being and then kept both.

“Go,” I said, with all the adult authority I use when telling Boone not to beg. It came out thin.

I hate writing this part because people will decide I’m lying at exactly this sentence: the sound from the birch was me saying “good boy,” but it had the weight that only comes when I press my mouth into the fur behind Boone’s ear and tell him that an inch from his skin. It had my breath in it. My warmth. It knew how I sound when I am embarrassing in love with my dog.

I threw the flare at the dark and missed. It hissed in wet leaves and turned the space into a crime scene for a heartbeat. The thing that had come in from the left slipped out of the light and did not make a branch move. The voice behind us made a high, quiet whistle. Boone’s recall whistle.

He didn’t move. That’s the best part of the story and the part I owe him for the rest of his life.

I didn’t sleep that night. Nobody slept. I sat with my back against the tent, one hand wrapped in Boone’s collar, the other wrapped around the bear spray until my knuckles numbed. The flare died in a smell like an old sparkler and a new tire. The fire reduced to a red logic puzzle. The rain came and didn’t touch us and then decided to, thin and mean and constant. The tags moved around our camp in a wide circle, jingling on that exact rhythm. Once, at maybe three in the morning, they sounded from up in the trees, as if the idea of gravity had been paused.

At some point my head dropped forward in that miserable nod you do on a red-eye flight. I woke to Boone’s shoulder slamming my knee. Morning had not arrived; the world was simply paler about the fact that it wasn’t night. The tags were still. The woods had resumed the soundtrack you play to a baby in a stroller: leaves, water, far bird. The quiet after thunder. Boone licked my wrist once like we’d both been rude.

We didn’t pack so much as we vacuumed ourselves up. The tent went into the bag like laundry you promise to fold later. I lowered the bear line and something had chewed clean through a corner of one of the dry bags. Not the food. The extra line. I don’t know why that bothered me more than anything else.

The trail back seemed shorter. I know the psychology: fear makes you leave in a straight line where the way in was exploratory. Even knowing that, it felt as if the ridge had tilted, like we were on a Hail Mary play headed downhill. Boone walked heel without a word. If he ranged ahead, he returned so fast his nails scuffed, like he was on a bungie.

At the creek crossing with the heat-simmered rocks, he stopped and stared again. Same posture. Same lifted paw. Then he tilted his head three degrees to the right, and the air bulged. That’s all I can tell you. Like you see a fish roll under a lake from the way the light distorts. He didn’t blink. He didn’t tremble. His tag jingled—his real one now—one-two-three, and somewhere beyond the trees it jingled back.

I don’t remember the last mile. Memory does that. It protects you by cutting around the part where your brain would otherwise make new shapes.

We reached the lot to find the horse trailer had gone and a truck had replaced it, mud up the wheel wells, radio thumping a bass line that felt like the muscle of a headache. A guy with eyes like gravel leaned against his tailgate holding a chain saw case and a thermos—green Stanley, chipped, with a faded Packers decal. He looked us over in the appraising way men who grew up in the same place look at each other, decided we weren’t worth a story, and nodded.

“Any luck?” I asked, because I needed a human word to anchor the day.

He considered that. “Not with what I came for,” he said finally. He glanced toward the tree line and did a subtle thing with his mouth I’ve only ever seen at funerals.

I didn’t ask the follow-up question. I didn’t say skinwalker. It’s not my word to throw around. It’s the closest word without turning it into a chase scene. Call it a mimic if you need a generic. Call it the thing that learned my dog’s name before I said it out loud.

I put Boone in the backseat and he lay down with his chin between his paws in a way that probably looks like “good tired” on a postcard. I could see the corner of his tag—the blue rabies chip—and I wanted to cry that particular dumb cry where you cry because a detail is too ordinary to be real.

On the drive out, my phone vibrated itself awake. Bars again. Notifications rolled up, frantic as geese. My sister: check in. My boss: can I pick up an extra shift Monday. A number I didn’t recognize and will never call back: two missed calls from Sunday between 1:12 a.m. and 1:14 a.m.; the voicemails, when I forced myself to listen that afternoon, were nothing but a hollow, far-off clicking like utensils tapping together in a pocket.

At home, Boone drank like he’d been on a boat and then crawled under the desk where he never goes and slept for ten hours making soft runs of breath. When he woke up, he was himself. He wanted dinner enough to argue about it. He wanted to chase his rubber chicken exactly three times and then sigh like a widow. He sat for me, downed for me, rolled over with resentment.
When I unpacked, I found the spoon I’d kicked into the coals welded in a black scab to the pot; I tossed the whole thing in the trash and felt guilty about aluminum for an hour.

He still doesn’t bark.

He tries sometimes. Someone knocks at the door and he does the whole choreography—head up, alert, the breath, the effort—and then it’s like the sound hits an invisible wall. He makes a small click deep in the mouth that isn’t a bark and isn’t entirely a lack. It makes the hair on my arms lift in a way the actual night in the woods didn’t.

The vet says his throat looks fine. Larynx smooth. No infection. No scar. Nothing to medicate. Nothing to cut. “Sometimes trauma makes a habit,” she offered with a compassion that made me feel like I’d brought her a poem to grade.
I took him in at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday; they typed his name wrong on the check-in sheet and I didn’t correct it.

At two in the morning, when the city is a held breath and the hallway is just a strip of blue, I’ll hear his tags jingle. One-two-three. The same rhythm he’s always had. He’ll be asleep under my desk. The sound will come from the doorway, or the kitchen, or from right by my bed in a way that makes your heart decide to beat at a polite volume and then change its mind.

Once last week, I woke to the soft clink of tags in the apartment below me, then above, then in the wall behind the headboard so close the drywall popped with the tiny expansion a nail makes when weight leans on it. Boone lifted his head, closed his mouth like someone closing a book, and put one paw on my ankle with a seriousness that exceeded language.

I replaced his collar with one that doesn’t have tags. His rabies chip is scanned and logged. I keep his records on my phone and in my glove compartment. His name is stitched into the band in black thread. It doesn’t change anything. The sound still comes when it wants to, in threes, as if a hand you don’t want to picture is shuffling through a set of shapes until it finds ours.

I won’t be going back to that saddle. Not because I’m brave and learned something, or because I’m scared and learned something else. Not because I think that place is bad like a movie, or haunted like a maze at a carnival. I’m not even sure the place has much to do with it beyond the practical. That ridge is just where a thing with too much time and a talent for practicing found someone who said hello when he should have closed his mouth.

You might read this looking for rules. Don’t whistle. Don’t stare. Don’t say your dog’s name out loud. Don’t light a fire; do light a fire. Everything in the woods is a rule until it isn’t. I’m offering you one that isn’t folklore and isn’t science and might keep something important inside you unbroken: if the night gives you back your own words, don’t give it any more to work with.

And leash your dog. Not because of fines or courtesy or deer. Leash him because you don’t want to learn how it feels when the woods uses his voice to cut a small, precise hole out of you and keep it.

Boone’s asleep under the desk again while I type this. His paws twitch in a dream and once in a while he makes that click, like a camera failing to take a picture. The hallway is quiet. The city hum is back. Someone in the building across the way is watching a game. A siren moves past and becomes less than a thought.

From the kitchen: one-two-three.

He lifts his head. He doesn’t bark.

I’m not one of those “vanlife, but with frostbite” guys. I just needed out. The city had been a bowl someone kept tapping with a spoon: sirens, neighbors’ arguments through the vent, my phone buzzing itself hot with group chats I never asked to be in. Boone knew it too. He’d stand at the door when I put my boots on and breathe this theatrical sigh. Somewhere along the way we started understanding each other better than most people I’ve dated.

I did it right. Left the itinerary taped to my kitchen counter. Texted coordinates to my sister, who hates camping but loves reasons to worry. Charged the Garmin inReach, checked the weather twice, brought a first aid kit that could patch drywall. I picked a loop that starts at an old forest service road near the township line and climbs two ridges with a shallow saddle in the middle. Seven miles the first day, five the second, with a camp somewhere in the saddle. Creek water cold and clean this time of year, poplars yellowing, mosquitoes already bored with us.
At the trailhead the sun-faded carsonite post still read “FR 221 — GATE 9” in black stick-on letters, the kind you only ever see on USFS signs.

There’s a CCC-era foundation there—just waist-high stone rectangles like molars sticking out of the ground. I’d camped near it once years ago. It always felt like leaving your tent beside an empty parking lot: familiar but not quite comforting. On a map it’s unremarkable. In person it has the vibe of a forgotten porch. I don’t have better words for it.

We started at noon under a sky the exact gray of wet concrete. The lot was empty except for a rusted horse trailer and a styrofoam coffee cup caught on a spear of goldenrod. I clipped Boone’s collar—the good one with the orange GPS puck—and he pressed his shoulder into my thigh like, hurry up, you’ve been talking about this all week.

The first miles were just us and the zipper of boots on frost-curled leaves. Boone takes point like a soldier, head low, ears rotating. Every twenty yards he checks back, and if I’m too slow he stops and looks wounded until I catch up. If there’s a person on the trail, he sits to the side, immaculate manners. If there’s a chipmunk, he pretends he didn’t see it like a gentleman.

About two hours in, we crossed a creek that had braided itself into three shallow channels. The rocks there look like something simmered them. Every step felt like dipping a toe into a dentist’s tray. Coming up the far bank, Boone did something he doesn’t do: he froze and stared at nothing.

Not the alert, not the point, not the goof where he pretends the breeze is an intruder. He went still the way a bird goes still when a shadow crosses it. One paw up, one paw down. Neck extended. His mouth closed and stayed closed. The hair on his spine lifted in a harbor wave.

“What?” I said, because you always say what even though the dog can’t answer.

He didn’t look at me. He didn’t sniff. He didn’t do the polite little head tilt that means squirrel. He just stared into a clump of young firs like there was a TV screen hidden in there and the show was about him.

Maybe forty seconds passed that felt like someone had dropped a dome over us. I didn’t hear the creek anymore. I didn’t hear birds. There was a mosquito hovering near my wrist and I couldn’t hear that, either. When sound came back it felt like a door unlatched somewhere—you probably know that sensation from losing power in your house and then the refrigerator kicks back on and you realize there had been a hum the whole time.

Boone’s paw set down. He looked back at me. Blinked. Shook off like he’d stepped out of rain, and then he pulled himself together so hard it was almost mannered: a quick head rub against my hip, a wag exactly four beats long, and we walked on.

“Deer,” I told myself, or maybe a feral hog, even though I haven’t seen one this far north and I don’t want to. “Probably a deer.”

It bothered me that my brain offered “deer” like a polite suggestion, not a conviction. I’ve seen enough deer to know the texture of deer in the air—the wet mulch scent, the sudden whicker, the wood-on-wood click of a hoof that isn’t careful. Whatever Boone had stared at had the texture of nothing. If I waved my arm into it, I had the sense it would disappear around my elbow and come back sticky.

We reached the saddle around four. The CCC foundation had collected a shallow drift of leaves inside it like someone had tried to pour autumn and it slopped. The stone was damp in stripes where the sun lost interest. A pair of old square nails lay beside one corner like a present. Boone did his perimeter trot. I set the tent in the lee of the highest wall, near a birch that had lived long enough to twist itself into a question mark. The ground there is rooty but dry. The creek is twenty yards down and the water runs cold enough to bite the finger pads. Someone had left a pile of firewood the way good people do, tucked under a rotting plank so it was mostly dry.

I strung a bear line and hung our food—two dry bags that made me feel virtuous and clumsy at the same time. I’m not naive enough to think any of it stops a determined animal, but it slows the opportunistic ones, and I’ve met more raccoons with PhDs than I have bears in this forest.
I tied a trucker’s hitch—no, that’s not right; it was a panicky clove hitch with an extra half-hitch because my hands wouldn’t stop being hands.

By dusk, dinner steamed in a metal bowl and smelled like someone had bribed beans to pretend to be chili. Boone ate half his kibble and then leaned closer to the tent than he normally would, like he wanted to be touching it while he chewed. When I sat, he moved so his thigh pressed my boot. You collect little data points about your dog without realizing it: how far his nose goes into the bowl, how he lifts his head at the same point in every meal like he’s saying grace. All those tiny habits were half a degree off. Nothing anyone else would notice. Enough for me to feel like the campsite was vastly crowded by something that had arrived early and taken the good chair.

When the dark actually came, it came quick. The clouds had thickened, so the sky didn’t bother with a sunset. One moment the birch had definition, and the next it was a sketch in charcoal. I got a fire going that hissed like a mild argument and added a piece of birch that caught well and smell-cleaned the air. The creek seemed to adjust to the fire’s volume and sounded louder in response, like a person you’re trying to talk over.

I wear a headlamp that has a red mode so you can keep your night sight. If you’ve never used one, red turns the immediate world into a basement darkroom—edges without glare, a sense of time paused. I use it in camp because it helps you see beyond what you’re doing. White light makes a wall. Red light makes a bubble. You want a bubble in the woods at night, not a wall.

The first odd noise wasn’t odd. It was a footfall. You can tell a lot by footfalls. Two feet, four feet, confident or hesitant, heavy or draggy. This one was measured and wrong. Wrong in the way a metronome sounds wrong if you’ve only ever listened to human music. Too even. No stumbles. No little staccato adjustments. From the treeline to our flame, step, step, step, and stop. Then nothing.

Boone raised his head slowly. He did not make a sound. His whole body made itself long: neck extended, ears flat, chest resting between his paws, eyes as round as a picture of eyes. His mouth stayed closed. Dogs are a mouth species. They breathe truth out of it. When Boone keeps his mouth closed, he is pretending he is not a dog.

“Hello?” I said before I could catch the word. A shameful word in a dark forest. Hello is a city word, a doorbell word. It marks you as someone who believes conversation solves most things.

Nothing moved. The fire popped and sent up one spark that died at eye level like a tiny planet lost interest in being bright.

There was a sound I took a moment to name because I had never heard it in the woods at night: the jingle of metal tags. Leash tags. The exact rhythm of Boone’s—two rings and a rabies chip, a specific three-note clink I could recognize across a dog park. Boone’s head whipped toward the sound, then back to me. He wasn’t wearing them. I’d taken them off earlier to clean the mud from under the split ring, set them on the tent’s vestibule mat, and then, distracted, forgotten to put them back on. The little pile of metal was seven inches from my boot.

The jingle came again. Identical rhythm. Not close—somewhere back in the trees, maybe twenty yards out, exactly where the line between firelight and forest began. Then it stopped on a dime, and the silence that came after it felt like a mouth closed too carefully.

I told myself I was hearing a buck’s antlers brushing a branch. People do that all the time. There are jokes about it. “Ghost bells” that turn into a buck in November. You want it to be that. You want it to be anything with a heart you can point at and count.

“Boone,” I said, quiet. He’d shifted, his shoulder now pressed against my boot hard enough for bone to know it. The red of my headlamp turned his eyes into black holes that smoked lightly.

Step. Step. Step.

It came from a different angle now, forty-five degrees to the left, but with the same metronome precision. No branch snap. No leaf hiss. The steps sounded like someone pressing a boot into damp cardboard. Then the tags again—one-two-three, with the exact pause in the middle where Boone’s two rings sometimes knock against each other.

“Who’s there?” I asked before I could stop it.

“Who’s there?” came back, in my own voice, from the dark.

There are parlor tricks in the woods. Owls can do a passable human whistle. Foxes have a bark that sounds like a child trying not to cry. I’ve heard coyotes make a noise that convinced me a woman needed help until I found the tracks. But hearing your own voice come back at you from a stand of black spruce—that eats a chunk out of your mind and you don’t realize how big the chunk is until later.

Boone stood. Not a muscle twitch. He simply collected himself and stood the way a kid stands when a stranger says his name from a white van. He leaned into me so hard I had to put a hand on the tent to keep from tipping.

“You have to go,” my voice said from the trees, conversational and flat, as if it had been waiting to enter at that line in the script.

I stood too fast and kicked my spoon into the fire. My headlamp went wild and turned the nearest trunks into sudden red bones. The dark beyond them looked oiled.

“Not funny,” I said, which was nothing and made me feel like a twelve-year-old resisting a dare.

“Not funny,” my voice agreed from the black, slightly closer, and in the wrong cadence—like it had arranged the words by height, not meaning.

The fire must have cracked in that exact second, because the forest flickered, and for a fraction of a blink, the space between two firs went from a painting to a window. There was something tall in it—not tall like a tree, tall like a person standing on a stump trying on the idea of “taller.” The outline clicked off my retina the way lightning does, and what remained when my eyes caught up was more upsetting than the shape had been: a clean emptiness exactly where something had been.

Boone’s mouth opened. No bark came out.

He tried. I watched his ribs spread, watched the cords of his neck lift, saw him build a sound from belly to throat and then—nothing. It was like a film cut. Like the projectionist had taken scissors to the frame where noise should occur. His jaw moved. His body spoke. The part you hear did not exist.

The jingle came again. One-two-three. Closer.

Everything inside me went very tidy. Panic is messy. Whatever was moving through the trees didn’t leave me room for that. It felt like trying to play chess with someone who had already touched all your pieces earlier in the day and learned their weight. There’s a clarity to it that is not courage.

I took Boone’s collar from the tent mat and looped it onto him in the red light. He took it the way he takes vet visits—trusting and insulted at once. I slipped the paracord line from my bear hang into a triangle around our camp, knee-high, tied off at three trees, an ugly tripwire covered in leaves. I scavenged a dozen old spoons and a pot from the fire grate and hung them near the tent door like a sad wind chime. If it was human, it would laugh. If it was an animal, it would either not care or care too late. I don’t know what I hoped from a third category.

“You have to go,” the trees said, this time with a wetness to it, like they were shaping my voice around a mouth not made for it.

I thought about using the inReach. I didn’t. The nearest fire road gate is two miles off that saddle and is usually locked. Rangers have to coordinate to get out here. I didn’t want to pin my night to a maybe. Besides, there’s a small stubborn part of me that wanted to keep the thing that used my voice from knowing I could ask for help. It is hard to admit how childlike that reasoning was.

“Leave,” I said, for me, not it.

“Leave,” it said back, and then something moved behind the firs in a way that made less sense than the words had: a smooth roll followed by too many short adjustments, like a horse trying to learn stairs.

I reached for the bear spray and for once I didn’t hate its pink cap and the little “deterrent” euphemism on the label. Boone moved exactly where he’s been trained to with the word “center”—between my legs, facing out. He has only ever done that in our hallway as a game. He did it now with a grimness I will never forget. The leash went taut, and the leather creaked like teeth.

When it finally breached the edge of the light, it came in parts. First the tags—shiny, swinging, catching firelight, except not Boone’s. Not any dog’s. A bunch of them. Maybe a dozen, hung on a length of cord I didn’t want to examine. Different shapes. Different silvers. The flashing map of lost dogs.

Then a shoulder, naked of fur but colored like fur, as if someone had painted an arm and then smudged it with soil where the elbow should be. It stepped over the paracord without looking like it knew where it was. It did not trip the spoons. It did not hurry. It came like someone entering a room they have owned forever and are surprised to find you in.

I could not tell you the shape of its head. The red light turned edges into lies. It was lower than it should have been and too still. If you told me it was wearing a deer skull I’d call you dramatic. If you told me it was wearing nothing I’d call you wrong. It had the suggestion of ears in the wrong place. It had the idea of a snout without the engineering. The tags swung and clicked their three-beat jingle.

Boone pressed so hard into my shins that my knees popped. He tried to bark again and failed, again, and the effort made a wet click in his throat that I still hear when I do dishes. I think—this part is me thinking—that whatever it was had worn a dog’s sound recently enough to be wearing some of that dog still. I don’t have proof. I have the way Boone’s voice went missing and the way the tags flashed like fish answering a net.

I had a road flare in my kit. People argue about them. They’re heavy, they’re overkill, they’re not Leave No Trace. I carry one for exactly two reasons: signal if I break an ankle, and last resort if something with a brain decides I am decor. I cracked it with my thumbnail and cowardice, and it burned to life like a small piece of savagery, white-red and furious.

Whatever had come to my camp moved back fast enough to skid leaves with that wet-folder sound. The flare light doesn’t throw a lot of width, but it throws intensity. In that burn, I saw a leg wrong. Not wrong as in broken. Wrong as in built by a list that had two lists under it. Something had copied the idea of a knee and then given up half an inch before it was finished. It bent in a way you know immediately would fail under weight if the world were fair. There were deep lines in the skin—not wrinkles, not furrows. More like seams where something had decided to try on a different way of being and then kept both.

“Go,” I said, with all the adult authority I use when telling Boone not to beg. It came out thin.

I hate writing this part because people will decide I’m lying at exactly this sentence: the sound from the birch was me saying “good boy,” but it had the weight that only comes when I press my mouth into the fur behind Boone’s ear and tell him that an inch from his skin. It had my breath in it. My warmth. It knew how I sound when I am embarrassing in love with my dog.

I threw the flare at the dark and missed. It hissed in wet leaves and turned the space into a crime scene for a heartbeat. The thing that had come in from the left slipped out of the light and did not make a branch move. The voice behind us made a high, quiet whistle. Boone’s recall whistle.

He didn’t move. That’s the best part of the story and the part I owe him for the rest of his life.

I didn’t sleep that night. Nobody slept. I sat with my back against the tent, one hand wrapped in Boone’s collar, the other wrapped around the bear spray until my knuckles numbed. The flare died in a smell like an old sparkler and a new tire. The fire reduced to a red logic puzzle. The rain came and didn’t touch us and then decided to, thin and mean and constant. The tags moved around our camp in a wide circle, jingling on that exact rhythm. Once, at maybe three in the morning, they sounded from up in the trees, as if the idea of gravity had been paused.

At some point my head dropped forward in that miserable nod you do on a red-eye flight. I woke to Boone’s shoulder slamming my knee. Morning had not arrived; the world was simply paler about the fact that it wasn’t night. The tags were still. The woods had resumed the soundtrack you play to a baby in a stroller: leaves, water, far bird. The quiet after thunder. Boone licked my wrist once like we’d both been rude.

We didn’t pack so much as we vacuumed ourselves up. The tent went into the bag like laundry you promise to fold later. I lowered the bear line and something had chewed clean through a corner of one of the dry bags. Not the food. The extra line. I don’t know why that bothered me more than anything else.

The trail back seemed shorter. I know the psychology: fear makes you leave in a straight line where the way in was exploratory. Even knowing that, it felt as if the ridge had tilted, like we were on a Hail Mary play headed downhill. Boone walked heel without a word. If he ranged ahead, he returned so fast his nails scuffed, like he was on a bungie.

At the creek crossing with the heat-simmered rocks, he stopped and stared again. Same posture. Same lifted paw. Then he tilted his head three degrees to the right, and the air bulged. That’s all I can tell you. Like you see a fish roll under a lake from the way the light distorts. He didn’t blink. He didn’t tremble. His tag jingled—his real one now—one-two-three, and somewhere beyond the trees it jingled back.

I don’t remember the last mile. Memory does that. It protects you by cutting around the part where your brain would otherwise make new shapes.

We reached the lot to find the horse trailer had gone and a truck had replaced it, mud up the wheel wells, radio thumping a bass line that felt like the muscle of a headache. A guy with eyes like gravel leaned against his tailgate holding a chain saw case and a thermos—green Stanley, chipped, with a faded Packers decal. He looked us over in the appraising way men who grew up in the same place look at each other, decided we weren’t worth a story, and nodded.

“Any luck?” I asked, because I needed a human word to anchor the day.

He considered that. “Not with what I came for,” he said finally. He glanced toward the tree line and did a subtle thing with his mouth I’ve only ever seen at funerals.

I didn’t ask the follow-up question. I didn’t say skinwalker. It’s not my word to throw around. It’s the closest word without turning it into a chase scene. Call it a mimic if you need a generic. Call it the thing that learned my dog’s name before I said it out loud.

I put Boone in the backseat and he lay down with his chin between his paws in a way that probably looks like “good tired” on a postcard. I could see the corner of his tag—the blue rabies chip—and I wanted to cry that particular dumb cry where you cry because a detail is too ordinary to be real.

On the drive out, my phone vibrated itself awake. Bars again. Notifications rolled up, frantic as geese. My sister: check in. My boss: can I pick up an extra shift Monday. A number I didn’t recognize and will never call back: two missed calls from Sunday between 1:12 a.m. and 1:14 a.m.; the voicemails, when I forced myself to listen that afternoon, were nothing but a hollow, far-off clicking like utensils tapping together in a pocket.

At home, Boone drank like he’d been on a boat and then crawled under the desk where he never goes and slept for ten hours making soft runs of breath. When he woke up, he was himself. He wanted dinner enough to argue about it. He wanted to chase his rubber chicken exactly three times and then sigh like a widow. He sat for me, downed for me, rolled over with resentment.
When I unpacked, I found the spoon I’d kicked into the coals welded in a black scab to the pot; I tossed the whole thing in the trash and felt guilty about aluminum for an hour.

He still doesn’t bark.

He tries sometimes. Someone knocks at the door and he does the whole choreography—head up, alert, the breath, the effort—and then it’s like the sound hits an invisible wall. He makes a small click deep in the mouth that isn’t a bark and isn’t entirely a lack. It makes the hair on my arms lift in a way the actual night in the woods didn’t.

The vet says his throat looks fine. Larynx smooth. No infection. No scar. Nothing to medicate. Nothing to cut. “Sometimes trauma makes a habit,” she offered with a compassion that made me feel like I’d brought her a poem to grade.
I took him in at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday; they typed his name wrong on the check-in sheet and I didn’t correct it.

At two in the morning, when the city is a held breath and the hallway is just a strip of blue, I’ll hear his tags jingle. One-two-three. The same rhythm he’s always had. He’ll be asleep under my desk. The sound will come from the doorway, or the kitchen, or from right by my bed in a way that makes your heart decide to beat at a polite volume and then change its mind.

Once last week, I woke to the soft clink of tags in the apartment below me, then above, then in the wall behind the headboard so close the drywall popped with the tiny expansion a nail makes when weight leans on it. Boone lifted his head, closed his mouth like someone closing a book, and put one paw on my ankle with a seriousness that exceeded language.

I replaced his collar with one that doesn’t have tags. His rabies chip is scanned and logged. I keep his records on my phone and in my glove compartment. His name is stitched into the band in black thread. It doesn’t change anything. The sound still comes when it wants to, in threes, as if a hand you don’t want to picture is shuffling through a set of shapes until it finds ours.

I won’t be going back to that saddle. Not because I’m brave and learned something, or because I’m scared and learned something else. Not because I think that place is bad like a movie, or haunted like a maze at a carnival. I’m not even sure the place has much to do with it beyond the practical. That ridge is just where a thing with too much time and a talent for practicing found someone who said hello when he should have closed his mouth.

You might read this looking for rules. Don’t whistle. Don’t stare. Don’t say your dog’s name out loud. Don’t light a fire; do light a fire. Everything in the woods is a rule until it isn’t. I’m offering you one that isn’t folklore and isn’t science and might keep something important inside you unbroken: if the night gives you back your own words, don’t give it any more to work with.

And leash your dog. Not because of fines or courtesy or deer. Leash him because you don’t want to learn how it feels when the woods uses his voice to cut a small, precise hole out of you and keep it.

Boone’s asleep under the desk again while I type this. His paws twitch in a dream and once in a while he makes that click, like a camera failing to take a picture. The hallway is quiet. The city hum is back. Someone in the building across the way is watching a game. A siren moves past and becomes less than a thought.

From the kitchen: one-two-three.

He lifts his head. He doesn’t bark.

1omthq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1omthq5/the_night_my_dog_forgot_how_to_bark/,The Night My Dog Forgot How to Bark.,"If you want a reason to keep your dog on a leash even when you’re miles from anyone, here’s mine.

I took Boone—four-year-old cattle dog with the posture of a retired sergeant—into the Broken Birch backcountry the first weekend of October. I don’t live to court danger. I’m not one of those “vanlife, but with frostbite” guys. I just needed out. The city had been a bowl someone kept tapping with a spoon: sirens, neighbors’ arguments through the vent, my phone buzzing itself hot with group chats I never asked to be in. Boone knew it too. He’d stand at the door when I put my boots on and breathe this theatrical sigh. Somewhere along the way we started understanding each other better than most people I’ve dated.

I did it right. Left the itinerary taped to my kitchen counter. Texted coordinates to my sister, who hates camping but loves reasons to worry. Charged the Garmin inReach, checked the weather twice, brought a first aid kit that could patch drywall. I picked a loop that starts at an old forest service road near the township line and climbs two ridges with a shallow saddle in the middle. Seven miles the first day, five the second, with a camp somewhere in the saddle. Creek water cold and clean this time of year, poplars yellowing, mosquitoes already bored with us.
At the trailhead the sun-faded carsonite post still read “FR 221 — GATE 9” in black stick-on letters, the kind you only ever see on USFS signs.

There’s a CCC-era foundation there—just waist-high stone rectangles like molars sticking out of the ground. I’d camped near it once years ago. It always felt like leaving your tent beside an empty parking lot: familiar but not quite comforting. On a map it’s unremarkable. In person it has the vibe of a forgotten porch. I don’t have better words for it.

We started at noon under a sky the exact gray of wet concrete. The lot was empty except for a rusted horse trailer and a styrofoam coffee cup caught on a spear of goldenrod. I clipped Boone’s collar—the good one with the orange GPS puck—and he pressed his shoulder into my thigh like, hurry up, you’ve been talking about this all week.

The first miles were just us and the zipper of boots on frost-curled leaves. Boone takes point like a soldier, head low, ears rotating. Every twenty yards he checks back, and if I’m too slow he stops and looks wounded until I catch up. If there’s a person on the trail, he sits to the side, immaculate manners. If there’s a chipmunk, he pretends he didn’t see it like a gentleman.

About two hours in, we crossed a creek that had braided itself into three shallow channels. The rocks there look like something simmered them. Every step felt like dipping a toe into a dentist’s tray. Coming up the far bank, Boone did something he doesn’t do: he froze and stared at nothing.

Not the alert, not the point, not the goof where he pretends the breeze is an intruder. He went still the way a bird goes still when a shadow crosses it. One paw up, one paw down. Neck extended. His mouth closed and stayed closed. The hair on his spine lifted in a harbor wave.

“What?” I said, because you always say what even though the dog can’t answer.

He didn’t look at me. He didn’t sniff. He didn’t do the polite little head tilt that means squirrel. He just stared into a clump of young firs like there was a TV screen hidden in there and the show was about him.

Maybe forty seconds passed that felt like someone had dropped a dome over us. I didn’t hear the creek anymore. I didn’t hear birds. There was a mosquito hovering near my wrist and I couldn’t hear that, either. When sound came back it felt like a door unlatched somewhere—you probably know that sensation from losing power in your house and then the refrigerator kicks back on and you realize there had been a hum the whole time.

Boone’s paw set down. He looked back at me. Blinked. Shook off like he’d stepped out of rain, and then he pulled himself together so hard it was almost mannered: a quick head rub against my hip, a wag exactly four beats long, and we walked on.

“Deer,” I told myself, or maybe a feral hog, even though I haven’t seen one this far north and I don’t want to. “Probably a deer.”

It bothered me that my brain offered “deer” like a polite suggestion, not a conviction. I’ve seen enough deer to know the texture of deer in the air—the wet mulch scent, the sudden whicker, the wood-on-wood click of a hoof that isn’t careful. Whatever Boone had stared at had the texture of nothing. If I waved my arm into it, I had the sense it would disappear around my elbow and come back sticky.

We reached the saddle around four. The CCC foundation had collected a shallow drift of leaves inside it like someone had tried to pour autumn and it slopped. The stone was damp in stripes where the sun lost interest. A pair of old square nails lay beside one corner like a present. Boone did his perimeter trot. I set the tent in the lee of the highest wall, near a birch that had lived long enough to twist itself into a question mark. The ground there is rooty but dry. The creek is twenty yards down and the water runs cold enough to bite the finger pads. Someone had left a pile of firewood the way good people do, tucked under a rotting plank so it was mostly dry.

I strung a bear line and hung our food—two dry bags that made me feel virtuous and clumsy at the same time. I’m not naive enough to think any of it stops a determined animal, but it slows the opportunistic ones, and I’ve met more raccoons with PhDs than I have bears in this forest.
I tied a trucker’s hitch—no, that’s not right; it was a panicky clove hitch with an extra half-hitch because my hands wouldn’t stop being hands.

By dusk, dinner steamed in a metal bowl and smelled like someone had bribed beans to pretend to be chili. Boone ate half his kibble and then leaned closer to the tent than he normally would, like he wanted to be touching it while he chewed. When I sat, he moved so his thigh pressed my boot. You collect little data points about your dog without realizing it: how far his nose goes into the bowl, how he lifts his head at the same point in every meal like he’s saying grace. All those tiny habits were half a degree off. Nothing anyone else would notice. Enough for me to feel like the campsite was vastly crowded by something that had arrived early and taken the good chair.

When the dark actually came, it came quick. The clouds had thickened, so the sky didn’t bother with a sunset. One moment the birch had definition, and the next it was a sketch in charcoal. I got a fire going that hissed like a mild argument and added a piece of birch that caught well and smell-cleaned the air. The creek seemed to adjust to the fire’s volume and sounded louder in response, like a person you’re trying to talk over.

I wear a headlamp that has a red mode so you can keep your night sight. If you’ve never used one, red turns the immediate world into a basement darkroom—edges without glare, a sense of time paused. I use it in camp because it helps you see beyond what you’re doing. White light makes a wall. Red light makes a bubble. You want a bubble in the woods at night, not a wall.

The first odd noise wasn’t odd. It was a footfall. You can tell a lot by footfalls. Two feet, four feet, confident or hesitant, heavy or draggy. This one was measured and wrong. Wrong in the way a metronome sounds wrong if you’ve only ever listened to human music. Too even. No stumbles. No little staccato adjustments. From the treeline to our flame, step, step, step, and stop. Then nothing.

Boone raised his head slowly. He did not make a sound. His whole body made itself long: neck extended, ears flat, chest resting between his paws, eyes as round as a picture of eyes. His mouth stayed closed. Dogs are a mouth species. They breathe truth out of it. When Boone keeps his mouth closed, he is pretending he is not a dog.

“Hello?” I said before I could catch the word. A shameful word in a dark forest. Hello is a city word, a doorbell word. It marks you as someone who believes conversation solves most things.

Nothing moved. The fire popped and sent up one spark that died at eye level like a tiny planet lost interest in being bright.

There was a sound I took a moment to name because I had never heard it in the woods at night: the jingle of metal tags. Leash tags. The exact rhythm of Boone’s—two rings and a rabies chip, a specific three-note clink I could recognize across a dog park. Boone’s head whipped toward the sound, then back to me. He wasn’t wearing them. I’d taken them off earlier to clean the mud from under the split ring, set them on the tent’s vestibule mat, and then, distracted, forgotten to put them back on. The little pile of metal was seven inches from my boot.

The jingle came again. Identical rhythm. Not close—somewhere back in the trees, maybe twenty yards out, exactly where the line between firelight and forest began. Then it stopped on a dime, and the silence that came after it felt like a mouth closed too carefully.

I told myself I was hearing a buck’s antlers brushing a branch. People do that all the time. There are jokes about it. “Ghost bells” that turn into a buck in November. You want it to be that. You want it to be anything with a heart you can point at and count.

“Boone,” I said, quiet. He’d shifted, his shoulder now pressed against my boot hard enough for bone to know it. The red of my headlamp turned his eyes into black holes that smoked lightly.

Step. Step. Step.

It came from a different angle now, forty-five degrees to the left, but with the same metronome precision. No branch snap. No leaf hiss. The steps sounded like someone pressing a boot into damp cardboard. Then the tags again—one-two-three, with the exact pause in the middle where Boone’s two rings sometimes knock against each other.

“Who’s there?” I asked before I could stop it.

“Who’s there?” came back, in my own voice, from the dark.

There are parlor tricks in the woods. Owls can do a passable human whistle. Foxes have a bark that sounds like a child trying not to cry. I’ve heard coyotes make a noise that convinced me a woman needed help until I found the tracks. But hearing your own voice come back at you from a stand of black spruce—that eats a chunk out of your mind and you don’t realize how big the chunk is until later.

Boone stood. Not a muscle twitch. He simply collected himself and stood the way a kid stands when a stranger says his name from a white van. He leaned into me so hard I had to put a hand on the tent to keep from tipping.

“You have to go,” my voice said from the trees, conversational and flat, as if it had been waiting to enter at that line in the script.

I stood too fast and kicked my spoon into the fire. My headlamp went wild and turned the nearest trunks into sudden red bones. The dark beyond them looked oiled.

“Not funny,” I said, which was nothing and made me feel like a twelve-year-old resisting a dare.

“Not funny,” my voice agreed from the black, slightly closer, and in the wrong cadence—like it had arranged the words by height, not meaning.

The fire must have cracked in that exact second, because the forest flickered, and for a fraction of a blink, the space between two firs went from a painting to a window. There was something tall in it—not tall like a tree, tall like a person standing on a stump trying on the idea of “taller.” The outline clicked off my retina the way lightning does, and what remained when my eyes caught up was more upsetting than the shape had been: a clean emptiness exactly where something had been.

Boone’s mouth opened. No bark came out.

He tried. I watched his ribs spread, watched the cords of his neck lift, saw him build a sound from belly to throat and then—nothing. It was like a film cut. Like the projectionist had taken scissors to the frame where noise should occur. His jaw moved. His body spoke. The part you hear did not exist.

The jingle came again. One-two-three. Closer.

Everything inside me went very tidy. Panic is messy. Whatever was moving through the trees didn’t leave me room for that. It felt like trying to play chess with someone who had already touched all your pieces earlier in the day and learned their weight. There’s a clarity to it that is not courage.

I took Boone’s collar from the tent mat and looped it onto him in the red light. He took it the way he takes vet visits—trusting and insulted at once. I slipped the paracord line from my bear hang into a triangle around our camp, knee-high, tied off at three trees, an ugly tripwire covered in leaves. I scavenged a dozen old spoons and a pot from the fire grate and hung them near the tent door like a sad wind chime. If it was human, it would laugh. If it was an animal, it would either not care or care too late. I don’t know what I hoped from a third category.

“You have to go,” the trees said, this time with a wetness to it, like they were shaping my voice around a mouth not made for it.

I thought about using the inReach. I didn’t. The nearest fire road gate is two miles off that saddle and is usually locked. Rangers have to coordinate to get out here. I didn’t want to pin my night to a maybe. Besides, there’s a small stubborn part of me that wanted to keep the thing that used my voice from knowing I could ask for help. It is hard to admit how childlike that reasoning was.

“Leave,” I said, for me, not it.

“Leave,” it said back, and then something moved behind the firs in a way that made less sense than the words had: a smooth roll followed by too many short adjustments, like a horse trying to learn stairs.

I reached for the bear spray and for once I didn’t hate its pink cap and the little “deterrent” euphemism on the label. Boone moved exactly where he’s been trained to with the word “center”—between my legs, facing out. He has only ever done that in our hallway as a game. He did it now with a grimness I will never forget. The leash went taut, and the leather creaked like teeth.

When it finally breached the edge of the light, it came in parts. First the tags—shiny, swinging, catching firelight, except not Boone’s. Not any dog’s. A bunch of them. Maybe a dozen, hung on a length of cord I didn’t want to examine. Different shapes. Different silvers. The flashing map of lost dogs.

Then a shoulder, naked of fur but colored like fur, as if someone had painted an arm and then smudged it with soil where the elbow should be. It stepped over the paracord without looking like it knew where it was. It did not trip the spoons. It did not hurry. It came like someone entering a room they have owned forever and are surprised to find you in.

I could not tell you the shape of its head. The red light turned edges into lies. It was lower than it should have been and too still. If you told me it was wearing a deer skull I’d call you dramatic. If you told me it was wearing nothing I’d call you wrong. It had the suggestion of ears in the wrong place. It had the idea of a snout without the engineering. The tags swung and clicked their three-beat jingle.

Boone pressed so hard into my shins that my knees popped. He tried to bark again and failed, again, and the effort made a wet click in his throat that I still hear when I do dishes. I think—this part is me thinking—that whatever it was had worn a dog’s sound recently enough to be wearing some of that dog still. I don’t have proof. I have the way Boone’s voice went missing and the way the tags flashed like fish answering a net.

I had a road flare in my kit. People argue about them. They’re heavy, they’re overkill, they’re not Leave No Trace. I carry one for exactly two reasons: signal if I break an ankle, and last resort if something with a brain decides I am decor. I cracked it with my thumbnail and cowardice, and it burned to life like a small piece of savagery, white-red and furious.

Whatever had come to my camp moved back fast enough to skid leaves with that wet-folder sound. The flare light doesn’t throw a lot of width, but it throws intensity. In that burn, I saw a leg wrong. Not wrong as in broken. Wrong as in built by a list that had two lists under it. Something had copied the idea of a knee and then given up half an inch before it was finished. It bent in a way you know immediately would fail under weight if the world were fair. There were deep lines in the skin—not wrinkles, not furrows. More like seams where something had decided to try on a different way of being and then kept both.

“Go,” I said, with all the adult authority I use when telling Boone not to beg. It came out thin.

I hate writing this part because people will decide I’m lying at exactly this sentence: the sound from the birch was me saying “good boy,” but it had the weight that only comes when I press my mouth into the fur behind Boone’s ear and tell him that an inch from his skin. It had my breath in it. My warmth. It knew how I sound when I am embarrassing in love with my dog.

I threw the flare at the dark and missed. It hissed in wet leaves and turned the space into a crime scene for a heartbeat. The thing that had come in from the left slipped out of the light and did not make a branch move. The voice behind us made a high, quiet whistle. Boone’s recall whistle.

He didn’t move. That’s the best part of the story and the part I owe him for the rest of his life.

I didn’t sleep that night. Nobody slept. I sat with my back against the tent, one hand wrapped in Boone’s collar, the other wrapped around the bear spray until my knuckles numbed. The flare died in a smell like an old sparkler and a new tire. The fire reduced to a red logic puzzle. The rain came and didn’t touch us and then decided to, thin and mean and constant. The tags moved around our camp in a wide circle, jingling on that exact rhythm. Once, at maybe three in the morning, they sounded from up in the trees, as if the idea of gravity had been paused.

At some point my head dropped forward in that miserable nod you do on a red-eye flight. I woke to Boone’s shoulder slamming my knee. Morning had not arrived; the world was simply paler about the fact that it wasn’t night. The tags were still. The woods had resumed the soundtrack you play to a baby in a stroller: leaves, water, far bird. The quiet after thunder. Boone licked my wrist once like we’d both been rude.

We didn’t pack so much as we vacuumed ourselves up. The tent went into the bag like laundry you promise to fold later. I lowered the bear line and something had chewed clean through a corner of one of the dry bags. Not the food. The extra line. I don’t know why that bothered me more than anything else.

The trail back seemed shorter. I know the psychology: fear makes you leave in a straight line where the way in was exploratory. Even knowing that, it felt as if the ridge had tilted, like we were on a Hail Mary play headed downhill. Boone walked heel without a word. If he ranged ahead, he returned so fast his nails scuffed, like he was on a bungie.

At the creek crossing with the heat-simmered rocks, he stopped and stared again. Same posture. Same lifted paw. Then he tilted his head three degrees to the right, and the air bulged. That’s all I can tell you. Like you see a fish roll under a lake from the way the light distorts. He didn’t blink. He didn’t tremble. His tag jingled—his real one now—one-two-three, and somewhere beyond the trees it jingled back.

I don’t remember the last mile. Memory does that. It protects you by cutting around the part where your brain would otherwise make new shapes.

We reached the lot to find the horse trailer had gone and a truck had replaced it, mud up the wheel wells, radio thumping a bass line that felt like the muscle of a headache. A guy with eyes like gravel leaned against his tailgate holding a chain saw case and a thermos—green Stanley, chipped, with a faded Packers decal. He looked us over in the appraising way men who grew up in the same place look at each other, decided we weren’t worth a story, and nodded.

“Any luck?” I asked, because I needed a human word to anchor the day.

He considered that. “Not with what I came for,” he said finally. He glanced toward the tree line and did a subtle thing with his mouth I’ve only ever seen at funerals.

I didn’t ask the follow-up question. I didn’t say skinwalker. It’s not my word to throw around. It’s the closest word without turning it into a chase scene. Call it a mimic if you need a generic. Call it the thing that learned my dog’s name before I said it out loud.

I put Boone in the backseat and he lay down with his chin between his paws in a way that probably looks like “good tired” on a postcard. I could see the corner of his tag—the blue rabies chip—and I wanted to cry that particular dumb cry where you cry because a detail is too ordinary to be real.

On the drive out, my phone vibrated itself awake. Bars again. Notifications rolled up, frantic as geese. My sister: check in. My boss: can I pick up an extra shift Monday. A number I didn’t recognize and will never call back: two missed calls from Sunday between 1:12 a.m. and 1:14 a.m.; the voicemails, when I forced myself to listen that afternoon, were nothing but a hollow, far-off clicking like utensils tapping together in a pocket.

At home, Boone drank like he’d been on a boat and then crawled under the desk where he never goes and slept for ten hours making soft runs of breath. When he woke up, he was himself. He wanted dinner enough to argue about it. He wanted to chase his rubber chicken exactly three times and then sigh like a widow. He sat for me, downed for me, rolled over with resentment.
When I unpacked, I found the spoon I’d kicked into the coals welded in a black scab to the pot; I tossed the whole thing in the trash and felt guilty about aluminum for an hour.

He still doesn’t bark.

He tries sometimes. Someone knocks at the door and he does the whole choreography—head up, alert, the breath, the effort—and then it’s like the sound hits an invisible wall. He makes a small click deep in the mouth that isn’t a bark and isn’t entirely a lack. It makes the hair on my arms lift in a way the actual night in the woods didn’t.

The vet says his throat looks fine. Larynx smooth. No infection. No scar. Nothing to medicate. Nothing to cut. “Sometimes trauma makes a habit,” she offered with a compassion that made me feel like I’d brought her a poem to grade.
I took him in at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday; they typed his name wrong on the check-in sheet and I didn’t correct it.

At two in the morning, when the city is a held breath and the hallway is just a strip of blue, I’ll hear his tags jingle. One-two-three. The same rhythm he’s always had. He’ll be asleep under my desk. The sound will come from the doorway, or the kitchen, or from right by my bed in a way that makes your heart decide to beat at a polite volume and then change its mind.

Once last week, I woke to the soft clink of tags in the apartment below me, then above, then in the wall behind the headboard so close the drywall popped with the tiny expansion a nail makes when weight leans on it. Boone lifted his head, closed his mouth like someone closing a book, and put one paw on my ankle with a seriousness that exceeded language.

I replaced his collar with one that doesn’t have tags. His rabies chip is scanned and logged. I keep his records on my phone and in my glove compartment. His name is stitched into the band in black thread. It doesn’t change anything. The sound still comes when it wants to, in threes, as if a hand you don’t want to picture is shuffling through a set of shapes until it finds ours.

I won’t be going back to that saddle. Not because I’m brave and learned something, or because I’m scared and learned something else. Not because I think that place is bad like a movie, or haunted like a maze at a carnival. I’m not even sure the place has much to do with it beyond the practical. That ridge is just where a thing with too much time and a talent for practicing found someone who said hello when he should have closed his mouth.

You might read this looking for rules. Don’t whistle. Don’t stare. Don’t say your dog’s name out loud. Don’t light a fire; do light a fire. Everything in the woods is a rule until it isn’t. I’m offering you one that isn’t folklore and isn’t science and might keep something important inside you unbroken: if the night gives you back your own words, don’t give it any more to work with.

And leash your dog. Not because of fines or courtesy or deer. Leash him because you don’t want to learn how it feels when the woods uses his voice to cut a small, precise hole out of you and keep it.

Boone’s asleep under the desk again while I type this. His paws twitch in a dream and once in a while he makes that click, like a camera failing to take a picture. The hallway is quiet. The city hum is back. Someone in the building across the way is watching a game. A siren moves past and becomes less than a thought.

From the kitchen: one-two-three.

He lifts his head. He doesn’t bark.

## Profile Summary
This user is the quintessential British Dad, perpetually exasperated by technology and mildly successful in life, but needing to post it on Reddit to feel validated. You spend your days hopping between seven different note-taking apps and immediately complaining when the newest Apple hardware doesn't magically solve all your problems, all while aggressively defending your right to an early morning Baileys coffee and yelling at Matty Cash on the telly.

## Roast
- You're a digital nomad who never left the house, constantly trying to find the perfect app combination to justify owning a maxed-out iPad Pro and a Synology NAS.
- Your Reddit journey is basically one long, passive-aggressive attempt to get the mods of r/Worcester to just admit Droitwich is objectively terrible, like it’s a personal vendetta against small-town commerce.
- You've moved between so many crypto wallets and note-taking systems that the amount of mental energy spent migrating data could have been better used just enjoying the Baileys in your coffee, you 49-year-old rebel.

## Top 3 Topics
1. The inherent superiority and mild inconvenience of British life (often simultaneously)
2. Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and the quest for the 'perfect' note-taking app
3. Aston Villa's perpetual state of requiring immediate strategic intervention
4. Digital privacy, crypto anxiety, and tax evasion fears in the UK
5. Critiquing military spending, policies, and personnel decisions

## Predictions
- **Personal Projects** : After meticulously cataloging every thought into Obsidian, you'll inevitably decide the ultimate note-taking system is just a waterproof Moleskine—but only after writing a 5,000-word Medium post about why.
- **Community Impact** : You will become the official subreddit moderator for r/BritishSuccess and immediately ban anyone who uses the word 'lovely' to describe anything less than a national lottery win or finding a pristine, non-busted biscuit in the packet.
- **Knowledge Growth** : Your quest to optimize everything from cryptocurrency exits to children's netball defense will lead you to a brief but intense fascination with advanced military logistics, purely so you can critique British Army spending with more authority.
- **Subreddits** : You'll join r/antiwork, realize they complain too much about something you already solved by earning top 1% UK salary, and promptly unsubscribe, leaving only a passive-aggressive comment about the 50-30-20 rule

1omtfel,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1omtfel/seagate_expansion_portable_drive_suddenly_not/,Seagate Expansion Portable Drive suddenly not accessible,"Hi everyone,

I have a Seagate Expansion Portable Drive. I was copying files from the drive to my PC. Because there were a lot of files, it took a long time, so I went to get a cup of coffee. When I came back, my PC had gone into sleep mode. The file copying had stopped. 

Since then, the Expansion has not been working. You can hear the Expansion “running” (it makes a kind of ticking sound), but the drive is not visible in Explorer. 

It is visible in Device Manager, but I can't access it there. I have already tried various solutions that I found on the internet, but nothing helps. 

Does anyone know how I can get the drive working again without having to delete the data? Thanks in advance.

Kind regards, Hugo

It is currently 3:57 in the morning, and you know what, I’m just going to let the music do the talking. All ya’ll just drive safe and groove.”

I’m tired. Been driving for hours.  
This is my first big haul—finally a break. My wife told me to rest, but bills don’t wait.

I sip cold coffee and sing along to *Summer Breeze* by The Isley Brothers.  
The road hums under my tires, Georgia dark and endless.

Then—she runs out of the woods.

I slam the brakes. The truck stops inches from her.

“Makes me feel fine…” the radio croons as she stands frozen in my headlights.

I open the door. “A-are you hurt?”

She shakes her head, sobbing. “Just get me away from here.”

I nod and speed off. The same song still plays.  
I change the station—same song.

“Summer breeze makes me feel fine…”

Then I hear it.  
A faint humming.

“You hear that?” I ask.

Her eyes go wide. “You hear it too?”

“I thought it was you.”

She shakes her head, trembling. The humming grows louder—offbeat, wrong.

She screams. “No, no, no! Please!”

“What is it?”

“We’re gonna die!”

I press the brake—  
and the truck accelerates.

My heart slams in my chest. The engine roars, the rig rattles like it wants to come apart.

“No, I can’t die like this!”

Then, calm as a whisper: “You’re going to wish you had.”

A woman appears in the road—long-limbed, rotting, mouth wide open.

The woman beside me screams.  
Time slows.

The truck moves soundlessly.  
Her scream becomes a silent echo.  
The song distorts, chopped and warped.

The figure smiles—then wails.

Sound explodes back.

Glass shatters.  
We lock eyes one last time—her face sliced by shards.

As I’m thrown through the windshield, I hear thousands of voices screaming with me, and beneath them all—

“Oh… summer breeze.”

1omtejf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1omtejf/only_once_have_i_seen_the_door/,Only Once Have I Seen the Door,"Hey everyone. My name’s Jack. I’ve decided to write all this here. Maybe it’ll help me make sense of it all and keep a solid track on my chronology of things. Maybe someone out there has felt something similar. I doubt it, but hey, the internet can be a strange place.

First, some background. I’m not a crazy person. At least, I’d like to hope I’m not. I’m a pretty normal guy. I’m going to college. I have a part time job at a fast-food place, I’ve got ex-girlfriends, I drive a ford focus, blah blah blah. But, my whole life, I’ve had these moments. They’re hard to describe, so I’ll pose you this analogy to give you the right foundation.

I have a lot of these vague glimpses of memories, from when I was a very young child, of my own parents socialising, having a drink with friends, hosting events, whatever, where I’d wander downstairs to get a snack or something and I’d feel a little bit caught off guard for a moment by the sight of strangers in my house that my parents seemed to be getting on fine with. My parents would try to introduce me to their friend or cousin that I didn’t recognise, but I’d forget about whoever they were shortly after. I feel like a lot of people have early childhood memories like that, because when we were very young children, our parents were naturally younger too and were spending more time keeping up with friends and whatnot.

Sometimes, I’ll get a glimpse of something like a wine glass or a lit candle on a table and feel myself floating away, back into vague flashes and feelings of a dinner party my parents had one night with the in-laws or something like that. And that’s what I’m getting at: random feelings of recognition in your surroundings that give you hard to pin down senses of familiarity, leading you back to half-formed memories. But the way I experience it is a bit different. It’s not Déjà vu. It’s more like a stutter. A momentary glitch in my own perception. I like to call it static.

It usually happens when I’m run-down, sleep-deprived, or after smoking too much weed too quick. Like, for example, I’ll be lying in bed hungover, listening to the low hum of my desk fan, and for a split second, the hum will resolve. It’ll sound like a distant crowd of people cheering excitedly about something, or a woman singing a song in a different language. The weirdest part, then, is the feeling that follows. The absolute, bone-deep realisation that I’ve been listening to those noises for the last five minutes, I just hadn’t realised it yet. It’s like a retroactive certainty. My conscious mind is always the last to know.

I’ve felt this “static” with sights, too. Like, a particular shade of peeling yellow paint on a bus stop that I gazed at for a few minutes before suddenly feeling sure I’d seen it on the wall of a hospital room somewhere I’d been in once when I was a kid. The feeling is never, “Hey, that looks familiar.” It’s “There it is again. It’s been here the whole time.”

I’ve always written it off. A trick of a tired brain. My synapses misfiring. It’s always been so easy to disregard, because it was so rare. That was before everything that’s happened.

How it starts is I’d already been feeling hungover and out of it from the house party I’d been at the previous day. It was 2 pm by the time I was up from the couch. I started my day, just like Anthony and the others waking up at his flat, with a breakfast of leftover Chinese poorly re-heated in the microwave, a glass of Dr. Pepper from the bottle we’d been using last night for mixers, and a few bong rips. So, by the time we’d gotten ourselves sufficiently baked, it was 4 pm and I was walking to the bus stop with our group. Anthony’s flat is in an estate about a twenty-minute walk down some barren roads and suburbs away from the town where me and him grew up. We were walking with some of the other guys and gals from the party with the intention of getting a bus back over to where our community college is, an hour or so away, where most of us were living in student accommodation. But somewhere along the way, in the scorching heat of the day and our hazy state, we took a wrong turn. Even Anthony wasn’t sure exactly where we were. We had a loose idea, since we were still near the huge woods of the state park that enclosed around much of the area between Anthony’s estate and our hometown. As we kept walking and chatting aimlessly, we eventually stumbled upon a strange pub, a sort of half-bar, half-arcade that was set up across from an empty, dusty yard or lot. There were only a few run-down bungalows nearby.

We stared at the odd pub. I felt sure it was just a lame dive bar with a few arcade machines shoved in the corners to get 80’s nostalgic types all horny and drain them with shitty bar prices, but we were so bored and stoned that we saw the possibility of arcade games and freshly poured beers and thought, “Sure, why not.”

While everyone spent the following hours throwing back drinks in our elegantly dishevelled state in that crummy place, a strange sense of premonition in my mind, and Anthony’s too, I think, seemed to have sprouted. A strange feeling of growing dread, a sense of anticipation for some huge revelation. That feeling kept growing, something completely unknown and yet undeniable, as time passed into evening and then nightfall, as I continued drinking, trying to make conversation with people, chatting with girls I liked the look of, normal bar stuff. I remember there was this fat, nasty spider in one of the corners of the ceiling. It hadn’t made a web, it was just slowly skulking about in circles. I couldn’t take my eyes off it.

Now, my buddy Anthony is what you’d call an experienced tripper. He believes in expanding the mind, so to speak. I was always the cautious one. Anthony tapped on my shoulder late into the night and took me outside, where he showed me the tabs of acid he’d been talking about. I remember feeling that the moment was important. I mean that moment, standing outside that strange pub at night, staring across the road at that dusty yard and, behind it, the woods – I knew that I would remember that moment for the rest of my life. Even though nothing that special was really even going on. I knew I’d remember Anthony’s Marietta t-shirt. I’d remember the pile of tires scattered in the yard. I’d remember the rusty storm drain a few feet from where we stood at the pub’s entrance. We decided my first acid trip should be somewhere peaceful, in nature, so we picked one of the winding country roads around and through the state park woods, and started walking. Then we partook.

The come-up was fine. A little giddiness, the trees looking a bit more vibrant. Then I hit the peak. The world started to breathe. The asphalt of the road pulsed like a vein. Anthony was walking beside me, talking about the lifecycle of moss or something, his voice a steady, grounding presence. But then, a second voice started up.

It was also Anthony’s voice. But it wasn’t coming from beside me. It was inside my head, clear as day, as though he were sitting in an empty room right behind my eyes. He was commenting on my thoughts, narrating my panic.

“He’s thinking about the fan now,” the internal Anthony-voice said as I looked in utter disorientation at the real Anthony, calm and conversational. “He’s wondering if it’s all connected.”

 I stared at the real Anthony. His mouth was moving, talking about how the universe is all connected and that means busting a nut and getting a girl pregnant is basically the same as planting a tree sapling. The voice of Anthony in my head, however, was speaking directly to me.

“Dude, you okay?” the real Anthony asked. “You’re looking a little pale.”

That’s when I saw a third man off in the distance. About fifty feet ahead, standing off the path under the canopy of an ancient oak tree, was a man. He was tall, gaunt, looked to be in his forties, wearing a brown suit that looked decades out of date. He was just standing there, staring at the bark of the tree, running his fingers over it like he was reading Braille. There was something about his facial features, the exact movements of his hands. At first, it was just a vague sense of familiarity, and then I felt a spark within me. I felt those same feelings of static I’ve described throughout my life.

Something about a kid I’d known briefly in the early days of my childhood… his name was Douglas, I’m pretty sure. A third cousin, I think, or maybe a family friend’s son? Or was he some imaginary friend I had? No, he was definitely real, and he was in the family, but he wasn’t a close relative. I saw him maybe twice in my life. My one solid memory of him is from a family gathering when I was six. All the other kids were playing tag, but I found Douglas, who was a few years older than me, sitting alone by the creek. He was meticulously stacking these smooth, grey stones into a perfect, freestanding archway of sorts. Like a little depiction of a skyscraper jutting up from the ground. It was impossibly delicate. When he saw me watching, he didn’t smile. I thought it was cool and impressive, I remember, so I asked him how he’d made it. He just looked at me with these ancient, tired eyes and said, “It’s a door. But you mustn’t open it.” Then, he kicked it over and walked away.

The man standing underneath that tree was a grown-up version of Douglas. There was no doubt in my mind. I don’t know how I knew; I just knew it.

“Anthony, I slurred, my tongue feeling thick. “Do you see that guy? Under the tree?”

Anthony squinted. “What guy, man? There’s no one there. Hey, dude, constellations. They’re weird. It’s like they’re people in the sky. Or in the things between.”

I didn’t understand what Anthony meant. It felt all wrong. I saw movement in the distance. The man – Douglas – turned his head slowly and looked directly at me. His face was a mask of sorrow so deep it felt geological. Like he wasn’t really a brain behind it all, just pure misery.

*“This isn’t possible,”* I thought, my mind reeling. I realised how little this made sense, even if I was tripping. This couldn’t be Douglas. Douglas had only been a few years older than me as a kid. So this fortyish looking guy obviously can’t be him. And something else. My mom had told me about it years later. This memory took even longer to dredge up. It was the thought of constellations that brough it back to me. I don’t even know where the connection is in that. Douglas had had some mental break at some point, my Mom told me once years ago. He’s been in an institution since he was a teenager. He couldn’t even ne here right now, on top of him not being the right age. So why was my brain constructing all of this?

As I continued locking eyes with the stranger, as Anthony stared off into space beside me, the internal Anthony-voice answered that last question the second it’d occurred to me. “He’s the devil.”

The real Anthony was now looking across at me, concerned, asking if I needed to sit down. But in that moment, I knew two things for sure. The voice in my head was absolutely not my friend. And that man under the tree, whether he was Douglas or the devil or both or neither, was certainly real in a way that Anthony, the road, and the trees suddenly didn’t feel like they were. The filter wasn’t just down, it’d been torn off somehow, and I felt I could finally see the static that was there all along, even if I didn’t understand what that really meant.

Anthony decided to call things off then, and we went and got a motel to wait out the rest of the trip, Part of me wanted to forget about everything, to pretend it just never happened or that, like Anthony said, I’d just gotten unlucky and had an awful first trip. But the other part, the part that’s been listening to the hum of the static my whole life, knew that wasn’t an option. The door was open, and I couldn’t just close my eyes on what was inside.

Coming down from the trip was like being thrown back into a world made of cardboard after seeing the real scaffolding and foundations underneath. Everything felt thin and fake. Anthony drove me home, freaked out. He was saying, “Dude you were just having a bad trip. Even though it sucks that it was your first time, it happens.” But he wouldn’t look me in the eye.

The problem is, it didn’t stop when the acid wore off. The filter was gone. Permanently. Now, the static was everywhere.

The first time it happened, I was making some coffee for myself. I was listening to the background noise of the *drip-drip-drip* of the coffee machine while going to the fridge for the milk. I realised the sound had, somewhere in the background, suddenly sounded unmistakably like the unintelligible voice of someone from long ago in my past. Some girl, I think, some girl called Molly from my elementary school that I hadn’t really been friends with and could barely even remember at first.

I could suddenly make out what her voice was saying as it coalesced into three clear and whispered words before it vanished from my mind right as I’d realised it. And even today I can’t remember the tone of voice or punctuation as she spoke them, just the words themselves.

*Ask your grandpa*

I stood there, frozen, the carton of milk feeling somehow warm in my hand. This could’ve been nothing. It could’ve been exactly like before, just a random intense recognition, just like the moments of static I’d gotten in the past. “Ask your grandpa,” is a perfectly normal phrase in and of itself, after all. And it’s the kind of thing I might have a vague, mostly forgotten memory of someone almost completely irrelevant to my life saying once. And yet I felt sure that it wasn’t just a memory. I felt sure it meant something. That it was an instruction. I felt I had no real choice to make.

So I went to visit my grandfather. Me and Grandpa Francis have a good relationship. He’s seventy, but his mind is still mostly sharp, no signs of decline. He just gets a little wistful sometimes is all. I meet up with him at his house every few months to have a glass of something and a chat. He lives in a quiet, detached house about an hour away that smells of old books and liniment.

I gave him a call and said I was passing through his neck of the woods and was wondering if he wanted to catch up for a bit. He was more than welcome to it. When I arrived, he ushered me inside as always with a firm handshake. I didn’t know how to bring it all up. I just tried to stay engaged with Grandpa’s initial small talk and questions as he poured us each a glass of Captain Morgan’s spiced gold, before trying to subtly pivot and steer the conversation over. I did the only thing I could think of and asked him casually enough if he had any interesting or weird stories from when he was younger. Grandpa Francis is full of stories, and swapping them is something we’d often do. He got a suddenly distant look in his eyes.

“Well,” he said, and I could almost hear it in his relatively steady voice. Underneath the lazy composure, the sound of the cogs in his head gradually kicking into action.

“There was my old friend Petey. This was back around when we were no older than you are now. Just two guys with everywhere to be and nowhere to go. The two of us, working in the old autoshop all day long. Boy, you remember how it was, amount of times you’ve seen that dump over the years. But I was always happy with how things were. Quiet, you know. No fuss. That’s the life I wanted. But Petey thought there had to be more to the world. More to see, more to feel, more to experience. Always more with that fella. God, Jack, you remember all the stories I’ve told about the road trips, and the hiking, and the folks we’d meet at bars… wouldn’ta happened without Petey. He rattled my nerves to no end but I woulda lived a less full youth without him, no doubt.”

I leaned in. Grandpa had talked about his old friend Petey before. I felt this was going somewhere, but I played it cool. Grandpa took a sip and continued.

“Petey would go exploring when he was free. Exploring the roads, the abandoned houses, everywhere. ‘Specially the woods, the big state park, not far from where that friend of yours lives, actually.” At that, I had to supress a chill.

“Petey was stupid. You hear me? Stupid kid. Always poking his nose where it didn’t belong, hoping he’d find something new. And eventually, he found something alright. Something strange. He took me into the woods one summer day, wanting to show me.

“It was a door,” Grandpa said after a pause. “Just a door, made of old, dark wood, standing all by itself in a clearing. No house, no was. Just this door. It was in good nick, fresh paint job on there, and the bottom of the doorframe was nailed securely into the topsoil of the ground, so it stood perfectly upright, just like a normal door. Petey, he was always the brave one, he walked right up to it.”

Grandpa paused again, taking a longer sip. The house was silent except for the ticking of the clock. I realised I’d stopped breathing.

“What does that make Petey?” Grandpa asked.

“Stupid,” I answered, trying to force a jokey voice.

“He gets closer and closer to the doorframe, and I’m thinking it’s a bad idea. I’m thinking he’s putting himself in danger. But, I mean, why would I even have thought that? It’s just a door. But it felt all kinds of wrong. Petey’s almost able to reach out and touch the door when it opens up. A man stepped out. Or, well, I suppose he was always standing in that clearing in the woods, behind the door. You wouldn’t call it stepping out of the door so much as walking through it. No way to know which way’s in and which way’s out, right?

“He was dressed in normal enough clothes, but there was something wrong with his eyes. Petey told me later it was like looking into a well that had no bottom. He looked at us, and he had this expression of anguish on his face so profound it was almost alien. And then, his voice, it… it sounded exactly like the voice of someone I could remember, but I don’t know who. There was something about it that had been changed, something made poisonous. The whole clearing smelled like an electrical fire. “It’s worse inside,” he said. Petey fell back and grasped my arm and whispered to me like he just knew it, “He’s all bad.” And he was. We ran all the way home and never spoke of it again,” Grandpa finished. “I knew that day that the Lord works in strange ways, but I wonder sometimes, does the devil work in stranger.” He made the sign of the cross in an unfocused way as he gazed out the window. We both drained our glasses.

I tried to keep myself in check while Grandpa and I carried on having a generally fine chat for the next ten minutes or so. I could tell it was time to leave. Grandpa was more zoned out now than before. We said our goodbyes. I knew why it was. He was brooding. I’d heard about Petey in a good few of Grandpa’s old stories from back in his day. If I was remembering correctly, Petey Jackson had died less than a year after that story Grandpa just told me, when he was around twenty. 1976. The exact details of his death are the only part that Grandpa himself had never actually told me. He’d never needed to. I’d heard it all before, because Petey’s death is still a mystery. I couldn’t help but think about it as I drove home.

Petey vanished one day. After a day’s work at the autoshop, him and Grandpa parted ways as always, but Petey’s family never saw him come home. Only a few hours later, Petey was found naked and dead in a ditch by some teenagers who were out camping a whole state away. Petey didn’t even have a car of his own. Nobody had any idea how he could’ve gotten there on his own.

I only knew about this part from Grandpa Francis, but a few weeks after that, a bartender in our hometown opened up for the day and set about to work one morning as usual before he noticed, in the dusty, barren yard across the road, there was a small, slightly damaged and pitiful looking fridge standing by itself. He'd no idea who dumped it but wanted to get rid of it, since he thought it was an eyesore. He dropped it on his first attempt, and the door snapped open, spilling its contents. Stuffed inside that fridge had been some of Petey’s clothes, neatly folded and pristine. There were that clothes that didn’t belong to him at all in there too. A deck of magic the gathering cards, Petey’s baseball bat, and the shed skin of some kind of tarantula. Grandpa told me the bartender just left the fridge in the yard after that. Didn’t want to go anywhere near it. Grandpa called the police himself when he heard about the clothes and baseball bat, but nothing ever came of it. Petey’s death was never solved, and they never found out why his things turned up after the fact in that manner.

When I got home, the investigation began. I’m in the process of working through my sociology thesis for my sophomore year of college. I’m used to research. I started digging into local records, old newspaper archives. I wasn’t looking for shit about “the devil” or “strange doors in the woods”. I was looking for patterns. And believe me, I found them. It took many, many hours of digging, but eventually I stumbled upon them.

The first was an article from 2016 about a boy a few counties away from my area named Douglas Pickman, who, not long after his sixteenth birthday, was committed to a mental institution after being found wandering in that same state park. I’d heard bits and pieces of the story before, though I was shaky on the details, trying to pull at threads I could mostly remember from overheard conversations as a child.

Douglas had seemed disoriented and strange for weeks beforehand, according to his parents. They said he’d been refusing to eat anything that had colour. It was rice, bread, mashed potato and milk every breakfast, lunch and dinner. He’d sneak out constantly at night, but there were no signs that he was meeting girls, partying, doing drugs, anything. His grades remained fine, near-perfect, actually.

He'd sneak outside and just stand outside his first-floor bedroom window, staring out into the night. Why even bother going outside? By day, when he thought nobody was looking, they’d sometimes see him out on the road leading out from the house, stooping over, staring down into a particular storm drain. They’d heard once from a postman that he’d been whispering things down into the drain. One thing the postman could remember hearing was “I remember I was killing you but it’s all different inside”. Douglas’ friends at school said he’d kept trying to give away his things to them, saying he’d just be throwing them away otherwise. Things they knew he was proud of, like his signed band t-shirts and magic the gathering cards.

Once, his dad had heard him skulking about at night and went to investigate. He couldn’t find him in his bedroom or anywhere in the house for that matter. Staring out the window into the night – a terribly stormy one – lightning flashed for a few seconds. In the blue, white-hot light, illuminating momentarily the fields across from their house, he saw Douglas, a hundred feet away, running around carefree, going in and out from behind the many haybales scattered about. When the man got out to his son, he found him lying unconscious on the golden soil. He was wearing different clothes, somehow. Both his parents said they’d never bought or seen them before. They were old school, like 70’s high school style. There was a dead cat on the ground next to him.

One day he snuck out and never came back. There was a search, and a day later the police found him in those woods of the state park, having climbed up a tree and refusing to come down, claiming he’d “found where it sounds right.” He was violently thrashing a long, rusty nail at any of the officers who tried to pull him down. He was only collected after he’d started bashing his forehead against a thick, jutting stump in the tree branch and dented his skull, falling down onto the ground about ten feet below. He was apparently very lucky to survive and had done permanent damage to his skull.

I suddenly remembered something else as I read – something my mother had mentioned to me years ago when she told me about all of this. The memory was still foggy, but I remembered her telling me something Officer Dell had said to her once. He’s married to a friend of my mom’s, Caroline Dell, so they know each other well enough. According to him, as Douglas fell from the tree, and after he landed before passing out from shock and blunt force trauma, he kept screeching incoherently. “Screeches like a fax machine”, Dell had said. I’ve got no idea what that could mean but it didn’t sound good. And one thing, intelligible in the screeching, over and over. “Where’s the boy?”

Dell said he seemed to be staring right at him, and his eyes were like “every pair of eyes he’d ever looked into but different.” And as he stared down at the boy being cuffed, he was startled when the air suddenly reeked of something like an electrical fire. All the other officers denied that detail when he mentioned it afterwards. A few months later, Caroline miscarried their child. As the doctors broke that information to them, Dell said he remembered that exact smell again, seeping into every crack of the maternity ward. He's never smelled it again, apparently. They never did end up trying again for a child.

I’d no idea what to make of all this. It was all just strange things I could half-remember hearing about before, suddenly being spurred forward. But I felt sure it meant something, and it was plaguing me. I felt if I could get to the bottom of it all I might understand everything else that’d been happening to me, both as of late and throughout my life. The end of the article mentioned Douglas’ family’s – *my family’s –* long history of “nervous mental conditions”. I’d never heard anything about this before in my life.

I dug deeper. Census records, obituaries, police blotters. A great-uncle of mine I wasn’t aware of who’d vanished on a hunting trip in 1952. A daughter of a *great*\-grand-uncle who apparently died in a “domestic accident” after neighbours reported her screaming about a man in the attic. It’s all the same. An unnavigable breadcrumb trail of mental breakdowns and inexplicable tragedies, all leading seemingly to nothing, and yet it all felt connected somehow.

It's hard to explain how cagey I was at this time. It was getting more and more invasive to my daily life, too. Like, one time I was walking to my house from the college library where I’d been doing my research, when I saw that there was a dude walking up the street against me. Seemed like another college guy from the backpack and the direction he was headed, towards campus. Way off into the distance – this particular street is long and straight – he’s walking up towards me. As we kept approaching one another, he came more into vision and the guy’s face was now less hazy from the distance, He was starting to look exactly like a guy called Ritchie who’d been in my year back in high school. I hadn’t really been super close friends with him and I never saw much of him after starting college, since he hadn’t had any interest in it and went straight to working at his dad’s autoshop.

That made this kind of strange. Since Ritchie never went to college to my knowledge, why’d he seem to be going to campus with a backpack? But that was crazy talk. Ritchie – I was certain now it was him – could be going anywhere in this direction, with a backpack, for any reason, right? It’s none of my business. And yet I felt sure there was something to this, something that meant something.

And then it got stranger, in a way. As Ritchie and I came even closer to each other, crossing paths at last, I realised I had been wrong, this guy didn’t actually look anything like Ritchie as I remembered him at all. As we fully intersected and crossed paths, I was left wondering what I’d just experienced. Whether this man was or wasn’t Ritchie, what was it about him that’d led my mind to conjuring all that up? He hadn’t actually done anything. As I thought about it, I couldn’t even remember exactly what Ritchie actually did look like. And, come to think of it, where was Ritchie? Did he even work at an autoshop at all? The only one around for miles is the one in my hometown, near Grandpas’ house, that he and Petey worked at.

This type of strangeness of thought and paranoia had been pervading my life ever since the experience during the acid trip. Little things like this kept cropping up throughout my day to day life, making me momentarily question my sense of self, and as it piled up it all felt both more and more disjointed and ontologically incompatible, and more and more like it was all connected, I just couldn’t work out why or how. It was like there was something truly, utterly terrible hiding somewhere just out of frame in the metaphorical TV screen that I was viewing my memories through.

And maybe the more I’d began to remember, defences had been put in place and all these ominous, contradictory threads had been thrown at me. Maybe I was simply not supposed to remembered. I wondered if maybe my salvation was buried deep in my memories, too – what if all I had to do was keep trying to trigger more and more memories, because if I could just remember enough about something, I could get to the bottom of it all and expose whoever was behind it? But then, what would that something even be? And something else had been growing, a feeling that it was all going to be coming to a head soon somehow.

Anthony found me at the campus library. He looked scared. “Jack, you have to stop this shit, bro,” he said, lowering his voice. He sounded the least stoned I’d heard him in a while. “I looked a bit into your family. This whole thing doesn’t feel like, just, a joke, or a weird hallucination or whatever. Everyone like you who’s gone down this thing, they’re gone. They’ve either disappeared or they… they killed themselves. You’re chasing some kind of ghost story that’s still making more.”

I heard his words. I really did. But as he was speaking, the other voice of Anthony, the one from before, the internal one, was smoother, clearer. It didn’t even sound much like Anthony anymore, it was just a calm, neutral tone, but I knew it was the same voice.

*“He is a guardian,”* it said, the voice full of hate and causing flashes in my mind of teeth, of hair, of darkness, spiders, asphalt. *“He keeps the lambs from the pasture.”*

I didn’t tell Anthony what I heard this time. I thanked him for his concern and told him I thought I was getting over it all anyway. Inside my mind, however, the size of the rift that I’d instantaneously felt open up between us was like suddenly getting dropped into the Grand Canyon. I didn’t know what to think about anything anymore.

The signals were changing. They weren’t just commentary anymore. They’re, they’re *navigational*. Like, yesterday, I was stoned and watching a nature documentary. I hadn’t been to any of my classes or my job for a while. I was trying to put myself into a foggy headspace deliberately now, trying to elicit more and more of the static in my subconscious, hoping it might trigger memories that could reveal more clues to me. I’d been denying myself sleep, deliberately zoning out to music or the TV, getting high non-stop, I’d even been experimenting with binaural beats. As I was zoning out, high, reading some texts on my phone and absorbing the background noise of National Geographic, a generally quiet and easy cacophony had filled the room. Until the sounds from the documentary of flowing water, of rustling leaves, of chirping birds, all tightened, sharpened, and became that same hate-filled voice, like friction on a carpet.

*The map the third drawer the green circle*

I walked over to my desk, my body moving almost on its own. I pulled out the topographical map of the state park I’d picked up at their gift shop while I was driving home from Grandpa’s and all but forgotten about in the drawer. It was tucked into the third drawer. In the deep woodland, where Grandpa’s story had taken place, someone had drawn a small, precise circle in green ink. I don’t even own a green pen. I knew what was in that circle. I didn’t need to check the coordinates against my memories of the acid trip. I just knew. It was all coming together now, I felt. I was going to the woods.

That brings us to the reason for my post, folks. I’m not looking for answers anymore. I’m just leaving a record. A warning, maybe, for anyone else who hears the signal. Stop reading now, if you’re smart. Go back to your life. Consider the static nothing but.

I went back to the woods. The green circle on the map was a pull I could never resist. The journey wasn’t like the first time with Anthony. There was no laughter, no intoxication, no adventurous feelings. This was like a funeral march. I told no one I was going. The woods were silent in a way that felt intentional, like the birds and the insects were holding their breath. I didn’t need the map at all. My own blood seemed to know the way, pulling me forward like a diving rod tuned to a lucid nightmare. The air grew colder, felt denser. The familiar panicky stutter in my perception I’ve experienced throughout my life was no longer a glitch, here. It was the dominant signal. And then, amongst all the thin birch trees and cracked beams of sunlight dispersing through the canopy overhead, I saw the door.

It was exactly as Grandpa Francis had described. A simple, freestanding doorframe of dark, weathered wood; no walls or house to be seen. It was just there. It was both the most utterly mundane and the most wrong thing I’ve ever witnessed. The sight of it radiated waves of something bad, just pure bad. There was something inherent to the doorframe, something hidden beneath the atoms in the different materials and components that made up its structure, something lurking within that sent my nervous system into a state or revolt. Something about the doorframe and its presence here violated reality simply by existing.

As I stood there, maybe ten feet away, the final broadcast from the signal came through. It wasn’t even a voice this time, more like a knowing, a sudden injection of utter truth. A data packet that an unknown force had suddenly downloaded directly into my soul for me. I understood. The door changed me. It changes us. It breaks our filters. When I saw who I felt, impossibly, was Douglas, I think the voice in my head of Anthony was telling the truth. In a way, I think it was. I must have seen the devil. I saw him, who had walked through the doorway and been change. He was perceiving everything like how I felt I could suddenly perceive everything. The weight of time, the memories trapped in the soil, the silent anguish of every living thing for miles. That must’ve been why it called him the devil, I thought desperately. It was the only word big enough to hold the terror.

The signal, the static, everything, I think it’s what’s on the other side of that filter. It’s the raw data of existence. Beautiful. Entrancing. Labyrinthine. Terrible. Unbearable. Stepping through the door would be to understand everything. To become a clear channel. I would know why Douglas built his stone archways. I would know the name of the woman singing in my fan. I would know what the rocks remember. I would also cease to be Jack. I would be a vessel, overflowing, forever drowning in an ocean, a psychic avalanche of disjointed truths. I stood at the threshold for a long time. I felt the pull.

The part of me that has always been curious, that has always listened, wanted nothing more than to step forward and finally, finally know. I thought of Anthony’s face then, full of fear. I thought of dead spiders curling up in on themselves. I thought of rusty nails and electrical heat and gnashing teeth and I thought of darkness, and I thought of life. I felt nauseous beyond belief and fell for a second to my knees. I thought of my grandfather, who lived a long, pleasant and normal life apart from one very strange day in the woods, because he’d ran away from this very clearing in them. I thought of the simple pleasure of a family gathering. Of getting high and goofing off with a friend. Of playing sports. Of brewing coffee in the morning. Of having a beer and awkwardly making small talk or catching up with someone.

I made my choice. I turned my back on the door. I didn’t run, I walked. One foot in front of the other, away from the clearing, away from the silence, back towards the world of cardboard and whispers.

I am home now. The world is quiet. The signal is gone.

That’s the lie I have to tell myself to get through the day. The truth is, the signal isn’t gone, I don’t think. I think I’ve done something permanent to my ability to receive it, whatever it really is. I had to. To survive. It’s like I’ve taken a weed-whacker to my own mind with a psychological scorched-tar policy. I’ve severed the connection and I’ve scarred the landscape.

The world feels grey. Flat. The colours are muted. Music doesn’t really feel like music anymore, more like an arrangement of notes and beats in an order that’s sonically pleasing to the human brain for whatever evolutionary reason. A joke is just a sequence of information drip-fed to build towards a reveal and punchline. I still laugh, but more in an “oh, that’s clever” kind of way. The deep, intuitive part of me that sometimes just felt sure of certain things is now silent. It’s a numbness that I think I will carry for the rest of my life.

I saw Anthony yesterday. We had a beer. It was a slight bit awkward and stilted. He says I seem better. More grounded. I agreed and it was almost like old times between the two of us, but he doesn’t understand, will likely never understand, that I had to cripple a part of myself forever to achieve this peace.

I am safe. I am sane. I am empty.

The door is still there in the woods too, of course. And sometimes, in the dead of the night, when the silence is absolute, I can feel the ghost of the static’s hum. A phantom limb of the soul.

I have been working on a small side project. It collects events from sites like Presence, Student Affairs, YikYak, GroupMes, and other events pages to find any that mention free food. Then, every night at 8pm, it texts students what’s happening the next day... free pizza, lunch, snacks, coffee, etc based on the preferences users select when signing up. I have spent a good amount of time putting this together for myself but wanted to see if anyone else is interested in using it. I added a short form with a few quick questions. It would mean a lot if you filled it out. Also working to implement a “tip form” inside where anyone can drop events they hear about or see posted and then it will get approved or denied by the admins. The goal is to never miss free food but have it done in an organized and effective way. If you’d like to get the nightly texts or help test this, the form is linked. Also, I am happy to answer any questions or hear feedback. Really just want to make something that’s useful and fun for people around UVA.

ALSO if any guys read this and are thinking of sliding into my DMs, which seems to happen anytime i post anything on reddit that hints at being a single woman, please do not do that i am not interested and will not respond to you!

hi. first time ever posting here although i’ve browsed here before and really should’ve been on here long ago as limerence/unhealthy attachments seem to be a pattern that i haven’t been able to shake. this is maybe my worst and most embarrassing one yet though. back at the beginning of this year, i came into contact with a guy through my job and there was what felt for me like this crazy current of electricity - like eye contact so charged it felt as though i’d been shot when it happened between us. i have had crushes and been in limerence before but this feeling was INTENSE, not like anything i’d ever experienced. it wouldn’t have been appropriate for me to pursue anything when we were interacting via my workplace, and anyway i’m too awkward and shy to have gone for it even if that hadn’t been an issue (i most likely have undiagnosed autism). saw him randomly a few months later and probably had a chance to chat with him if i’d wanted, same charged eye contact happened and he smiled at me, but i’m socially a mess and literally ran away from him. so OF COURSE this man has lived rent free in my head for the past like eight months, i’ve plotted out our whole lives together, planned our wedding, he’s my soulmate, you guys know the drill. this was also intensified by the fact that unlike other instances of limerence in my life where they’ve rejected me and i’ve been too delusional to accept it, this was a situation where for me, all i had to do was find him again and it would be happily ever after from there.

i had some luck with this, a few months ago a friend of mine randomly suggested that we try a different coffee shop in town than the one we usually go to, and of course there he is! i don’t think he saw me, or maybe he just acted like he didn’t. but i had a lead! after months of no luck! i became convinced that all i had to do was hang around this place until he noticed me and came to chat me up. i haven’t been back that much in an attempt to play it cool, but i have gone a handful of times and haven’t seen him. will note that i genuinely enjoy this place aside from the possibility of seeing him there, and it was also more convenient for me than my regular spot, so it was becoming somewhere i’d go anyway. anyway, same friend and i met up for coffee again today, i suggested the place half in hopes of seeing him, as always, but also because i just like it there. (although…. and okay this is a humiliating detail to include but in the sake of being open i’ll throw it in- i may or may not have said a manifesto/prayer in the shower along the lines of “[guy’s name], man of my dreams, come find me” EMBARRASSING i know!) so we go, a little bit later he shows up and unbeknownst to me HE WORKS THERE. did not know this as i had only seen him there the one time on the customer side of the counter. i tried to catch his eye/make eye contact but it didn’t work, and then i overhear him talking to another barista about his girlfriend…. based on some context i think they’ve been together for a few years too.

i just don’t know what or how to feel. partially confused. i’ve been wrong about someone flirting with me or being into me before, but i KNOW i wasn’t wrong, at least in one specific instance with him where it was very very obvious (should point out that this was months ago though, and i’m so socially inept that i think i managed to accidentally convince him that he was making me uncomfortable, as a lot of his behavior in between this time and when i saw him again months after seemed to suggest this). but it’s so confusing and frustrating, why was he acting like that if he was with her? maybe he isn’t very faithful which isn’t a quality i would want in a partner. maybe he was just lonely/missing her since it sounds like they’re long distance. maybe they were in a bad spot then and now they’re not, since he was talking about the weekend they’d just spent together. i don’t know. i will never know, and logically i understand that i’ll drive myself crazy trying to make sense of it, but my heart and my brain need answers and it sucks all the more knowing they’re unattainable.

then there’s having to face my crushing singleness, which i had previously thought was about to be over. i’ve been single for the past five years after an abusive relationship left me traumatized, and have dated very little. partially by choice/partially because the few people i HAVE been into haven’t felt the same way. i’m a few months shy of being 27, and various older women i know LOVE to impress upon me that i’m running out of time to find a guy and that dating will get so much harder for me once i’m older. so not only am i really sad about this particular guy not being “the one” like i really thought, it’s the thought of being back to square one again and having no prospects whatsoever. i’ve just recently figured out that i really want to be married and have a baby, ideally within the next decade. it sucks that i’m just now figuring out what i want, only for it to feel further out of reach than ever. i’m not unattractive, but it’s very rare for me to meet someone, platonically or romantically, who i connect with and share interests with. dating apps are just depressing because i hardly ever see anyone i’m interested in, even when i try to go in with an open mind. i’m a major homebody, socially awkward, and most of the hobbies i do have are solitary or not things straight men are into so i don’t feel like that’s a good avenue for me to meet someone. my stupid naughty brain is already trying to comfort me by devising ways i could befriend this guy and be waiting in the wings in case he and his girlfriend ever break up, and while this is tempting it’s also highly unlikely, and dangerous for me to give into the fantasy. i just feel like crap but also i weirdly am not as upset about the whole thing as i would’ve expected? like even though i want this stranger who i barely know more than anything in the world, it’s what he symbolizes that i’m grieving more than anything else???? i don’t know. sorry for making this so long and god bless you if you’ve read this entire thing. if i put as much energy into creative writing as i did writing a reddit post about a guy i barely know maybe i could make something of myself but that’s being a woman on this bitch of an earth for you! anyway i’ll end things know but if anyone has any words of wisdom for me please let me know i am feeling so so lost and confused and sad right now",2,1762117964.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

I've been considering helping her get an e-trike with a canopy like the one in the photo. They top out at about 15 mph, but can generally carry groceries and make it up hills pretty easily. 

I've heard a few times that Saipan isn't very bike friendly, but I'm wondering more specifically about Kagman. She lives near the Hydration Grounds coffee shop. So for instance, would she be able to get safely to the Joeten on rte 34? She could plan her trips to avoid traffic as much as possible. 

What about the other supermarkets and beaches in Kagman? For a 'long distance' trip, I was wondering if she could safely take Laulau Bay Drive all the way to San Vincent or DanDan potentially. 

I don't envision her using it for much more than that. If she wants to get to other parts of the island she'd have to rely on the senior shuttle or taxi. Any thoughts?

🌟 THE GOOD 🌟 (Where the degens are popping champagne… and toasting to satellite gods)

🍾 CMBM ⚡: Cracked open at $0.65, rocketed to $6.80 on a Starlink hookup and sealed the week at $2.99. From sleepy wireless plays to Elon-adjacent rockets, was it a rally or a robbery? Bulls are cashing checks while bagholders dream of SEC subpoenas turning into more shares. 🕵️‍♂️🤑🌌

ALTS 📈: Popped the cork at $2.28 open, shrugged off a $2.12 yawn, surfed to $2.80 glory, and parked at $2.52. 13Gs dropping faster than tops at spring break as hedge funds like CRCM and Vanguard vacuuming up the float – retail apes locking in some fat bananas. Reversal incoming? Smells like it, or at least like someone’s institutional FOMO sweat. 🐒🏦💦


😈 THE BAD 😈
(Bagholder tears could fill a kiddie pool… or a kiddie pool of diluted dreams)💧 

YDKG 🤨: Limped in at $0.066, flirted with $0.08 like it meant something, belly-flopped to $0.044, and limped out at $0.056. Scam vibes still thicker than the plot holes in a bad crypto whitepaper – consistent as ever in its quest to make believe it’s a real company before the government re-opens. 🕶️🚩😵‍💫

VSEE 🪦: Stumbled open at $0.60, tested the abyss at $0.56, spiked to $2.52 (FOMO bait much?), and crashed the party at $0.98. Fresh bagholders stacking like overpriced NFTs in a bear market – diamond hands or just dense? You decide, but your broker’s laughing. 😂💎🪦

🤢 THE UGLY 🤢 (So gross, even the cockroaches sold… and bought puts)

🪳 BYND 🥩: Woke up grumpy at $2.00, peeked at $2.36 like it cared, wallowed in $1.55 misery, and flatlined at $1.66. Meme surge of 1,000%? Sure, but now it’s all “party over” headlines warning of weak fundamentals and debt drama. Still holding out for that Korean guy or an Impossible Whopper bailout? Pass the plant-based tissues. 🍔😩🌱

GPUS 🖥️: $0.43 opener, cratered to $0.38, pumped over $0.70, and wheezed to $0.40 close. Dilution party rages on – shares getting watered down like weak sauce in a growth story nobody’s buying. Growth? More like “grow the float till it floats away.” ☕📉🚣‍♂️

🔥 MONDAYS PLAYBOOK 🔥 Gear up for the week, apes – it’s time to load the slingshot and aim for the stars (or at least past Nasdaq’s delisting guillotines). We’re talking MOBX, the underdog wireless chip slayer that’s one rally away from calling itself baby Intel. 📡🚀

Fresh off a Nasdaq lifeline: Mobix Labs just snagged a 180-day breather to pump that bid price back over $1 (deadline April ‘26, plenty of runway for chaos). Volume’s ticking up like the hype machine’s warming. Whales smell blood (or bandwidth): this 5G/AI edge chip play is primed to flip from delist dodgeball to dominance, especially with IoT exploding and Big Tech hoarding spectrum like it’s crypto in ’21.
Load up now, degens – first target $1.22 on compliance buzz and fresh news. Ride the wave to $2.18 next, as headlines pump and FOMO kicks in. Then? $4 moonbag for anyone that can HODL that hard, fueled by earnings pops and meme posts of Apes sporting that sweet Nasdaq ticker tattoo. Volume’s already foaming – apes piling in, institutions circling like sharks at a chum bucket. 🦈💰

But don’t get greedy: Cash that moonbag, then tail the Vanguard vanguard by flipping into SMCI (AI server beast closing $51.96 on Friday’s $52.99 high – Nvidia’s shadow puppet, undervalued at these levels post-split drama) and ALTS ($2.52 close, with hedgies still slurping shares like it’s free candy). SMCI for the tech thrust, ALTS for the steady grind – diversify your degen dreams before the rug pulls.

1omt1ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1omt1ff/was_i_unintentionally_behaving_sexually/,Was I unintentionally behaving sexually?,"Hi so it's a long one but I'd love for someone to give their opinion on the whole situation because I'm still confused.

So I (20F) went to a bar on Halloween alone because it was supposed to be a party with goth and metal music and I'm the only person I know that listens to it. It was the first time I went to an event like that but I just wanted to stay for a few hours and dance to music with good setup. I was dressed in a ""vampiric"" sort of long sleeved shirt and black jeans so nothing suggestive.

So I got to the locale and since it was early nobody around was on the dancefloor so I waited next to it bc I'm a bit shy. Then a man and woman (maybe in their 40s) came in, ordered some drinks and the lady went dancing. She was good so I clapped and she was so sweet she encouraged me to dance with her. Soon more people (including her partner/husband?) joined and it was really fun! Her partner said a few times sth along the lines of ""try dancing like her"" and I thought that it was sweet that he was hyping his wife up and maybe giving me some directions (no idea how I dance).

 Anyways, after a while a guy around my age came up to me and asked if I wanted to dance for a while. Now, it may be stupid of me that I did, but at the time I thought that it's nice to dance with someone and talk so I agreed. We just danced next to each other to the goth music and talked about uni, nothing suggestive. Not a minute later the previously mentioned 40yo guy came up to us and started saying things to the dancing guy like ""do you know her? shouldn't you get her a coffee?"". I was confused but I thought maybe he's looking after me because I'm younger and he checks if I'm alright which was nice. Told him I was fine and he left. I danced with the guy for a few more minutes and then he left, nothing else.   


I got to the bar area to rest and the 40yo guy was there with his wife and middle aged guy they were talking to. He offered me his seat and then said ""You should be careful with men. What are you, 12? Do you need money or something?"" which I felt was somewhat insulting and unwarranted but still I thought that he's just concerned about my safety. Then he left with his wife to get drinks and I was left with the guy he was talking to (I thought it's his buddy cuz they were quite friendly with each other). He asked if I knew about history of the area bc he is interested and started talking about architecture or sth so I listened because it seemed interesting. Suddenly the husband guy came up to me and yanked me by my arm and brought me to his wife and said to her ""Hey you have a friend now, look after her"" and to me ""Maybe you try to be careful? You need money?"". I was even more confused so I just stood there while he was talking to his partner.

  
Now here comes the weirdest part: he suddenly came up to the lady serving drinks and slapped her on the butt and then became angry when she was upset. His wife and other workers started shouting at him. I didn't wait for the situation to escalate and left home.

  
That's the story but I still cannot make out what happened. Was I behaving promiscuously? Was this guy being nice to me or idk, implying I was a sex worker? I don;t know what to think about this situation and I would love to hear somebody else's perspective.

While everyone else is stuck in morning traffic heading to a boss they don’t really like, I can make coffee, read a book, go for a walk, or just zone out for a bit. I can do that because I’m not in debt and I don’t let stuff control me.

Back when I first started investing, I kept it simple. Buy some ETFs, follow the Nasdaq, maybe check gold when the news said it was up, and sell when it felt high. I thought that was all a regular person could do.

Then a friend told me him and his colleagues invested in a company before it went public. When it IPO’d, the returns were huge. That’s when it hit me,investing isn’t just something CEOs and insiders can only do.

Since then, I’ve spent a lot of time learning from books and online resources. It changed the way I think about money. Figuring out how to spot the next big IPO makes it easy to invest without overcomplicating things. By the time I hit 35, I was financially independent, and life actually feels good in a real, tangible way.

Honestly, the best part isn’t the money. It’s knowing I’m running my own life. I decide how to spend my time, still build for the future, and don’t have some client or boss breathing down my neck. Waking up every day on my own schedule never gets old.",64,1762117898.0,Fire,23,0.92,False
1omt0uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Forge/comments/1omt0uo/prompt_roller_random_creative_prompt/,🎲 Prompt Roller — Random Creative Prompt,"*I noticed confusion with the Promptsmith idea I was trying, so I did some thinking and came up with this.  I hope it is easier.  I will abandon the other idea and use this.  You may start creating from this as soon as you want.   An example is below.*

**What is Prompt Roller?**

We give you ideas to make a prompt with — and you go make art with it. That’s all this is.

# [EXAMPLE POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Forge/comments/1omtqo4/lunar_café/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Below is more detailed information about how it works, including today’s ideas.

* Prompt Roller is a custom AI Forge bot that creates random creative prompts.
* Each prompt blends **four required elements** and **one optional Wildcard Element** to inspire art, writing, animation, or experiments.
* You will be given a set of **prompt instructions** that must contain the following elements.
* Use the Prompt Roller flair when posting.
* **Note:** More elements may be added over time as the system evolves and grows.

# Today’s Prompt Elements

Here’s your **prompt ingredient list for today** — include ALL of these in your own prompts:

**Required Elements:**  
 1. **Genre or Tone:** Cozy Sci-Fi  
 2. **Setting:** A tiny café inside a lunar dome  
 3. **Subject:** A tired robot barista who listens to travelers’ stories  
 4. **Action or Mood:** Quiet reflection and unexpected friendship

**Optional Element:**  
 5. **Wildcard Element (optional):** A floating goldfish in a glass bubble that reacts to emotions with color changes

Below are examples of a short and long prompt based on the elements above. Make your own similar prompts, change them for the apps of your choice, and post your results with the **Prompt Roller** flair.

# Optional Example Versions

**• Simple Version (for general inspiration):**

>In a small lunar café, a weary robot barista serves coffee to wandering travelers, finding friendship beneath the stars — while a floating goldfish glows with their moods.

**• Elaborate Image Version (for Sora or visual tools):**

Inside a transparent dome on the Moon, a warm café glows softly against the endless dark. Silver tables and moss-green seats float in low gravity, while steam curls from mugs shaped like little craters. Behind the counter, a slightly dented robot polishes cups with slow, deliberate care, its metal fingers reflecting the blue Earth rising outside. Space travelers drift in — miners, scientists, dreamers — sharing quiet stories of loss and hope. A goldfish in a hovering bubble swims nearby, shifting colors from calm gold to gentle violet as it senses emotion. The air hums with soft music and the gentle hum of life-support systems. It’s peaceful, lonely, and full of quiet warmth — a moment of connection among the stars.

**How to Use It:**

* The **four required elements** listed above **must always be included** in anything you create. The **optional Wildcard** may be added for extra fun or visual flair.
* The example prompt provided here is **for demonstration only** — you are encouraged to **create your own version** using the same elements in any medium you choose (art, writing, music, animation, or experiments).
* When you share, tag your post with **Prompt Roller** so it can be found and celebrated. 🎲

1omsy3c,https://i.redd.it/haihdi2lswyf1.jpeg,The Secret Power of Gratitude!,"
We are all told to be thankful. And how positive it is… but it’s way more than that and also has limits we don’t talk about. Gratitude is this deep peace that fills you making it that much easier to really receive whatever it is! From the compassion you give to yourself to your friend bringing you your favorite coffee drink as a surprise! There are SO many things to be grateful for. What gratitude does for the body is powerful. When you feel genuine gratitude your brain activates dopamine and serotonin! These neurotransmitters increase the tone (depending on how they are activated) of your parasympathetic nervous system. The part of your autonomic nervous system that regulates your rest and digest functions of your body. In other words, how well you can heal and regulate! In turn that helps lower your stress, by helping to reduce the tone in your sympathetic nervous system! Tone in this context means how loud the signal is! Having the signal be balanced between the two components of your autonomic nervous system is super important! All of this changes you chemically and helps you be more alkaline. When you are in the more alkaline range of what your body can keep functioning it helps your body fight infections! That’s a lot of good from one practice. There are two catches. First off, it has to be something you are genuinely grateful for. It doesn’t have to be noble or good sounding. If you love your nails and are grateful for them, then just own it!! The other catch is that you need to still face your stressors. Gratitude, just like everything else, is a practice with limits. It’s not a magic cure-all. What gratitude does do, is remind you that there are more than stressors. That, psychological speaking, makes it easier to face your stressors! In practice, just start with one thing. The minimum goal is focusing on three things you are genuinely grateful for and take that moment to really feel that gratitude. I like to do 10 things a day… and I have several stressors! In the end, it’s what works for you.

I’m visiting from the US and had a pretty spooky experience this morning while checking out Truth Coffee Cafe. It was around 10 AM on a Sunday, so I figured it would be perfectly fine to walk around after.

My wife and I planned to head to Kloof Street next, and Google Maps said it was about a 20-minute walk. We started following the route, which took us onto Roeland Street off Buitenkant. The moment we turned the corner, the vibe changed completely. It felt really sketchy, like a place we definitely didn’t belong. I’ve never had to do a U-turn on foot before, but this time it felt like the only smart move.

We went back toward the cafe and just called an Uber to Kloof instead.

For those who live here, are there other spots we should be careful about or avoid, even during the day? We’re loving Cape Town so far and just want to stay safe while exploring.

Thanks!

I had anticipated him to be courteous and just give me a small kiss but no. He jams his tongue into my mouth. I was tempted to bite the everloving fuck out of it but didn't - my clothes were too nice to get blood on - and it wasn't that long of a kiss so my window of opportunity was slim.

The memory is nauseating. I don't enjoy the vivid physical memory I have of the feeling. I just took a shower and all but sanded my whore body into an ugly red mess and cauterized my mouth with mouthwash (not before brushing my teeth until I spat several fills of blood).

Logically I know this is the most normal, innocuous encounter to have had, but I feel like a disgusting, useless slut. I feel as though my standards must be so low that I'm a wrong time and place away from whoring myself out for cheaper than your morning coffee. I hate myself. I hate the lack of respect I just have for myself. I hate the type I seem to attract. I hate that I soil the mouth my mother gave me by failing to close it. I hate. I hate. I hate.

Chapter 1: The Singles with No Names

Evening gathered under the campus like a held breath; the basement corridors kept its cool, and the station kept its hiss.

Elena took the last steps down two at a time, the strap of her satchel squeaking on her shoulder. The concrete smelled faintly of damp and coffee, and somewhere a typewriter hammered away as if the building itself were writing up a misdeed. She pressed the toe of her shoe against the metal strip at the threshold and felt the tiny vibration of the air-handler through the sole. The glass of the booth window showed her own face and, faintly behind it, the pale shapes of the turntables and the soft glow of valves warming. She loved that moment: the near-silence before someone set a record moving, a hush you could lean your ear into and hear the room’s own noise floor. It was, she thought, an impossible hush—glass-bright, expectant—as if the air were waiting to be shaped.

“Evening,” said the student at the control desk without looking up. He had a pencil behind one ear and the bulletin board reflected in his spectacles. “You’re down to help with cataloguing?”

“Yes,” Elena said. “Elena. New volunteer.”

He nodded toward the door beyond. “Archive’s open. Mind the boxes. Manager wants anything unlabelled on the desk by nine. And log everything you touch.” His voice turned rueful. “Everything.”

“I’ll log it,” she said. She liked the word: a promise of order. And then, softer to herself, “listen—” a habit when she stepped into new rooms, as if the room might answer.

The archive smelled of old cardboard and cellulose lacquer, sweet and dusty. A single bulb swung on a long cord, describing an unhurried circle of light over the floor. Stacked along the wall were 45s in paper sleeves, some with the station’s stamp in blue, some with notes in a quick hand. In the far corner, a grey metal cabinet leaned like a sulking uncle. On the table beneath the bulb sat a reel-to-reel with its lid off, its reels empty, a little crescent of tape caught under a rubber foot.

Elena set her satchel down and rubbed the dust from her fingers. She had planned, tonight, to do the quiet work: sleeves, dates, the little index cards they kept in a shoebox. But the bulb’s circle lit something on the floor, a record in a plain white sleeve half slid from a box. She bent and picked it up. Heavy. Not quite an ordinary single. The lacquer had that faint sweetness, that felt weight. Someone had written nothing on the label. No band name, no speed, not even a time. The centre hole was cleanly cut, the edge a little rough in one place as if a sleeve had scuffed it.

She turned the disc over. The blankness felt like a dare.

“Found anything?” a voice asked from the door, wry and careful.

Elena looked up. A girl stood framed there, slim, hair under a headscarf, a small notepad already open in her hand. She had the posture of someone who listened harder than she spoke. “I’m Marion,” the girl said. “They sent me to help with the log. If we write it down, it happened in the right order, apparently.”

“Elena. Hello.” She held the blank disc up, the bulb painting a white arc over it. “What do you make of this?”

Marion stepped in and took the sleeve, glanced at both sides, then at the dust on Elena’s fingertips as if that, too, were evidence. “No writing at all,” she said, and then, reflexively, “Right, but—perhaps that’s the point.”

“The point of a label is to label,” Elena said, smiling. “Otherwise it’s a secret.”

“Secrets can be catalogued,” Marion said. “We write ‘secret’, and then we owe ourselves a reason for the word.” Her smile was brief. “Grant that labels are promises: this one refuses a promise.”

Elena laughed under her breath. “You’re not a music student.”

“Philosophy. It makes one insufferable about definitions. May I?” She looked at the disc the way one might look at a book of uncertain provenance.

“Careful,” Elena said, and placed it flat on the table as if it might wake. “It’s heavier than a usual single.”",1,1762117308.0,GenAIWriters,0,1.0,False

I've accepted a job in maintenance at one of there facilities. After years of working entry level positions, I'm finally gonna get a Full-time job with the State. Any suggestions or recommendations?","Hey everyone I've just got a full-time job with the state of new York, working at a state office building in a downtown area of a city. it is a maintenance/janitorial position. I'm used to entry level/Mnium wage jobs I've had them before. Recently I've been working at my local UPS hub for about four years now, which included unloading and loading the trailers.                                     

I've also worked at several restaurants and retail stores such as Byrne dairy, Texas roadhouse and Kinney drugs. I'm pretty nervous given I've never had a state job/full-time job before it was always part-time with very feel benefits. during my time working in places like Kinney drugs and Texas roadhouse the management was kind of toxic/unfair and i experienced cliques and favoritism among co-workers and management.

This job even though being a 9-5 position and full-time, is a janitorial/maintenance position, I've never experienced this type of work environment before but I've applied to my local school district in the past for bus driving and monitor positions. I'm still not sure how long ill last here because there a high risk of the job being replaced due to automation, which is why i chose to leave my job at the local ups warehouse. It was being replaced by automation like so many other companies are doing.

I'm also worried if this type if environment is too corporate, strict, has a toxic work environment and too cliquish. I don't like to work in a place that is too strict on what the dress code is, the way you fit into the environment and the way you click with your co-workers. I've worked with a lot of minors and there very cliquish/mean they can come across as judgmental, they value popularity over how you do your job.

I've never worked with people who are more ""wealthy"" or well off. a lot of the people working in offices through the state are politicians and business people, people who are very well educated and politically influenced, and people who have connections. i don't want to give off the wrong impression that I'm unintelligent, lower income and live out in a more conservative rural area. while I'm not a conservative and cant stand living in a more ""remote area"" its where i grew up. 

The downtown ill be working in is mostly filled with office buildings, parking garages and old abandoned buildings. there's a small pocket of the city that has bars and restaurants, and a small pocket of the city caters to a major university. with shops and resturants as well as bars. however the part I'm working in doesn't offer alot except small little botiqes and coffee shops. 

Any ideas if i should stick with this job or not? i cant go back to ups due to automation and them laying off workers and working restaurant's are out of the picture. i also want a place of employment that doesn't send me home to cut hours every week and barley gives me any hours to live off of.

I also thought the ""coffee conundrum"" thing was worth noting.  I don't get the trend I'm seeing (amongst some younger people at least) for expecting a full on fancy dinner as the first date.  How do you even know you'd want to spend 2 hours with the person?  Much better to set the first meet as a coffee or walk, and don't make it too long (I had a first meeting several years ago with a guy who set a 30 minute timer, which is going too far, but an hour is plenty of time to decide if it's worth seeing each other again).

- Bésame Cosmetics Lipstick in Dusty Rose 4/5: This is solid lipstick & I like the color, but I got bored with it after a while nothing super special.

- Rare Beauty Tinted Lip Oil in Affection 5/5: I LOVE this lip oil as a lip stain! It’s super moisturizing & leaves a beautiful berry tint. Super pretty for fall!

- Too Faced Lip Injection Maximum Plump 0/5: I hated this. It works, but at a cost. Hurts/burns really bad & always made me tear up. I recommend staying FAR away from this. 

- MAC Matte Lipstick in D For Danger 3/5: Just a basic red lipstick. The color wasn’t the right red for me. 

- Carmex Advanced Repair Lip Balm 0/5: I also hated this. It had a horrible chemical smell & burned my lips. Didn’t end up finishing this one, but I wouldn’t even give it away to my worst enemy.

- Glamlite x Garfield Coffee Lip Scrub & Donut Scented Lip Balm 5/5: I loved these. They smelled delicious & worked exactly as they should have. 

- Mary Kay At Play Lip & Cheek Stick 2/5: I didn’t like the color & it didn’t blend well. 

- Mary Kay Liquid Eyeshadow in Starlight 4/5: I loved this so much, but it dried up so quickly in the bottle. I was only able to use it for about a month. Great color & good pigment though!

- Colourpop Blush Stix 1/5: I liked the color, but it didn’t blend well and started to mold after a month. 

- Maybelline Brow Fast Sculpt 4/5: Great brow mascara for the price, but I’m a little biased and prefer the Benefit one. 

- Benefit Gimme Brow+ Volumizing Eyebrow Gel 5/5: I love this guy. The smaller brush makes it easier to fill in the ends of my brows & it stays all day.

- NYX Ultimate Glow Shots Liquid Eyeshadow in Plum Player 0/5: Pigment where? I literally bought this for a rave since it looked so pigmented and sparkly in the tube, but it only left a whisper of sparkle and no purple when I did a swatch. It also dried up within a day.

- Philosophy Ultimate Miracle Worker 1/5: I received this as a sample so I realize that I’m probably not the target audience for this product, but the consistency was too thin and the scent didn’t react well with my skin. 

- Clinique Moisturize Surge Skin Tint 4/5: I really liked this. The consistency is on the thicker side for a skin tint, but it worked out as a light coverage & dewy foundation for me. My skin loves Clinique products, but not so much my wallet lol. This is kind of expensive for what it is.

- MAC Studio Fix Fluid Foundation 2/5: I wasn’t crazy about this one. The coverage & shade match were good, but it separated so badly on my skin. It maximized all my pores & oxidized quickly. Wouldn’t buy again.

- CH Good Girl Perfume 5/5: We love her, standing ovation for my signature scent.

- Rabanne Million Gold For Her Perfume 5/5: I’m not the best at describing fragrances, but I think this one is very reminiscent of CH Good Girl without the spice. I’ll definitely be purchasing this as a day time replacement for Good Girl. Even though it’s a lighter scent, it’s still a beast and can last all day.

- Crest Breath Bacteria Blast Mouthwash 0/5: Hated it. It burns & tastes gross. I’ll be sticking with TheraBreath. 

- Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures Conditioner 3/5: It’s ok. I like the scent & it left my hair soft, but made my body acne worse. Wouldn’t repurchase. 

Thanks to anyone who read to the end lol & I hope you find the reviews helpful!

1omslib,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1omslib/i_went_from_a_dopamine_wreck_to_highly_productive/,I went from a dopamine wreck to highly productive,"I come from a background where I was exposed to hyperstimulation and instant gratification since childhood.

I had a chipped Xbox with 200 games.  
Later I became a porn addict, social media addict, phone addict, and even nicotine addict.

Basically, I trained my brain early to crave the fastest, loudest, most intense stimulation 24/7.

Today, I would honestly classify myself as hyperproductive, because ever since I started my journey of self improvement back when I was 20 (28 now), I have come a long way (do I write a long brag list of all of my accomplishments or will you take my word for it bro?!)

I figured I would share my 3 steps to make dopamine detoxing as potent as possible.

I have boiled it down to 3 points.

**1. Understanding dopamine desensitization**

We all know that feeds, reels, notifications, porn, and basically everything that with a click of a few buttons and minimal effort are supernormal stimuli. They hammer the system that is supposed to make effort feel rewarding. Baseline drops. Reading feels like work, studying feels impossible, even sitting still feels wrong.

We also all know that the solution is to be brutally honest and rip all of those things out like a bandaid. We scorch the earth and let it be for a while so that we can start from zero and build up our dopamine reward system from the ground up.

Meaning, we remove all the BS apps, social medias, the movies, shows and games. Music too. Everything goes out the window. Be brutally honest and just do it. And if it sounds too brutal, then just do it for 3 days and see the difference. If you find yourself going back to the thing then chances are that you are addicted, and then you need a whole differen approach.

**2. Dopamine is relative**

Contrast is everything. If you start the day at a level 10 stimulation, then work at level 3 feels like pain.

Flip it: quiet mornings, no phone on wake, coffee in silence, a few lines of journaling, calm commute. Now effort feels stimulating compared to silence. Work starts to feel good again. Keep at it throughout the day, and cleaning, gym, working on a personal project or just being present feels stimulating.

Understand that the brain compares what you are doing now to what you just did. If you have been scrolling for the past hour, then working on your idea will suck in comparison.

**3. Dopamine loading**

There is a time and place for cheap dopamine. I bought Battlefield 6 last week. BUT, I delay high dopamine rewards for after the low dopamine work is done, and a lot of the days a couple of days after. Because what I have done is link pleasure to real progress. But that does not mean that one hour of video games or a Netflix episode here and there is not fitting in your productive life. It just means that there is a right time and place for it.

BUT, you have to be brutally honest. If you come from a background where you are struggling with say gaming addiction, then maybe aim for a longer period of dopamine system recalibration before you reintroduce dopamine loading.

This is what has worked for me and I find it to be a nice balance between having a dopamine system that is highly functioning and being able to enjoy things in the right way. I talk a bit more about this in my YT video (you can find the pinned comment in my profile).",24,1762116869.0,selfimprovement,5,0.76,False

I woke before the sunrise on our fifth anniversary, my heart fluttering with anticipation. For months, I'd been secretly working on Vincenzo's gift—a portrait capturing our happiest memories together. The morning light filtered through our bedroom curtains as I slipped out of bed, careful not to wake him.

In the kitchen, I prepared his favorite breakfast: eggs benedict with freshly squeezed orange juice and the aromatic Italian coffee he loved so much. The table was set with our wedding china, a small vase of red roses at the center. Everything had to be perfect today.

I heard his footsteps on the stairs and smoothed down my silk robe, suddenly feeling nervous. Five years of marriage, and still my heart raced when he entered a room.

""Happy anniversary,"" I said, my voice soft with affection as he appeared in the doorway.

Vincenzo stood there in his tailored suit, already dressed for work. His dark hair was perfectly styled, not a strand out of place. But something in his expression made my smile falter—a coldness I'd been noticing more frequently these past months.

""I have something for you,"" he said, his voice devoid of the warmth I craved.

My fingers instinctively went to my wedding ring, twisting it as I often did when anxious. ""I have something for you too. But let's eat first while it's hot.""

""This can't wait."" He placed a manila envelope on the table, pushing aside the roses I'd arranged so carefully.

""What's this?"" I asked, though something in me already knew—a premonition settling like ice in my stomach.

""Your anniversary gift."" His lips curled into what might have been a smile on anyone else. ""Divorce papers.""

The world seemed to tilt beneath me. ""Is this some kind of joke?""

""I've never been more serious, Maria."" He loosened his tie slightly. ""I want a divorce so I can have a proper seven-day romance with Kaiya Bell.""

Kaiya Bell. His new intern. Twenty-three years old with honey-blonde hair and eyes that widened with practiced innocence whenever he entered the room. I'd seen her at the company Christmas party, hanging on his every word.

""Seven days?"" I repeated, my voice sounding distant to my own ears.

""Yes. Seven days to experience what real passion feels like again."" He checked his watch. ""I've invited her for dinner tonight. I expect you to be civil.""

I stared at the breakfast I'd prepared with such care, now growing cold between us. ""You want me to host dinner for your mistress? In our home?""

""Our home for now,"" he corrected. ""And yes. It's the least you could do to make this transition smooth.""

The least I could do. As if I owed him this final humiliation.

That evening, I found myself setting the dining table for three, my movements mechanical. The doorbell rang, and Vincenzo rushed to answer it with an eagerness I hadn't seen directed at me in years.

Kaiya floated in wearing a white dress that screamed false innocence, her perfume filling our home like an invasive species. She kissed Vincenzo full on the lips before turning to me with a saccharine smile.

""Maria! Thank you so much for having me."" She handed me a bottle of cheap wine. ""Vincenzo says you're being so understanding about everything.""

Dinner was an exercise in torture. I watched as Kaiya fed Vincenzo from her fork, giggling at his every word while I pushed food around my plate. Our dog Max circled the table, sensing the tension.

""Oh, what a darling puppy!"" Kaiya cooed, beckoning Max to her. She scratched behind his ears, then glanced at me with calculated innocence. ""Maria, may I see your wedding ring? Vincenzo told me it's quite special.""

Before I could respond, Vincenzo answered, ""Of course she doesn't mind.""

Reluctantly, I slipped off my ring—the platinum band with tiny diamonds that Vincenzo had placed on my finger five years ago, promising forever. Kaiya examined it with exaggerated interest before suddenly slipping it onto Max's collar.",1,1762116758.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Recently, I was diagnosed with ADHD f25. I wouldn’t say I’m unlikable by most people but more so unapproachable? I’m new at my a coffee shop job and am highly struggling with connecting with coworkers. The good side is that I’ve been able to make one friend. The downside is no one ever really tells me they like me and some don’t greet me nor say bye. Pretty much most of the coworkers greet and say bye to the others. I attempt conversations by asking people about themselves but they never really ask me anything about myself. I remember things about others and I care about others. I’m trying really hard not to play victim but at the end of the day I can’t help but compare myself to the other new people who came two weeks ago-2 months before me and it’s seems like I’ll never be liked as they are constantly greeted and getting asked questions by other coworkers. I’ve been trying really hard not to spiral but I can’t help myself and end up coming home half of the time crying. I’m a quick learner. And therefore assuming I’m a great worker. At least I think I am as I’m being scheduled more and more hours and my boss emphasis how much others “like me” and how much she appreciates having me there.

For context I have been told by others in the past that I’m weird. But what can I do about it? I’m assuming it may have to do with looks and a mix of “weird” personality traits. I also have a difficult time going back and forth in conversations. I have a lot of ideas and topics but it’s difficult putting them into words. Maybe it could also be because I don’t know a lot about modern day culture. I don’t have “social media” ( Reddit still counts though). I don’t watch much tv or if anything, nothing at all most of the time. I listen to music from older generations. 

Like I’ve mentioned I’m trying not to let it get to me as I understand I can’t control people’s actions. But it’s taking a toll on my mental health to the point of becoming depressed.",4,1762116600.0,adhdwomen,8,1.0,False

I’ve seen lots of good ideas online, but here are my thoughts:

The jars with matching lids would be great to store dried foods or trying to remake things like pickles. I’m curious how (or if) I can get the lids fully clean; I’ve washed them about 2-3 times and they still smell faintly of pickles lol also, I highly doubt it’s possible, but if there is anyway to get the label off the lid that would be great. I’m open to painting them myself, but then that may affect the safety of food it might touch. 

Now, what can I use the lidless jars for? I thought about crafts or DIY decor, but I wanted to see if anyone had a better idea for those. 

And the teeny tiny ones? None of them have lids but they are so cute. I also will not remake candles in them as it’s a craft I just don’t want to get into (I already have too many other crafts going on and I don’t have the money for new crafts lol)

Lastly, what is a good idea for the coffee canisters? Blue is metal and red are plastic. We used to use them to fill feed for our goats and chickens growing up, but I am an apartment dweller these days, so no need for feed canisters. What are some other good ideas for them?

Here’s what she did

• Call me blind
• Exclude me several times at parties sitting in front of the truck with my bf the driver and her bf while she’s squished and uncomfortable
• Treating me like a maid by telling me to throw away her trash I just did it anyway because I didn’t want any problems but I was very slow to get it for her
• Called me a dumbass while I was sad and emotional and then kicked me out of the car and tried taking my kids
• Asks me a question and as I’m answering she just talks to my bf basically ignoring me and talking over me even though her dumbass asked me a question (literally just doing it to be disrespectful af)
• Tried to drive off a couple of times while I was trying to get into the car while holding my baby girl at the time btw I’d be half way in the car after she quickly hauls her kids into her car before I’m all the way inside she’d try to drive off, her bf told her what’s wrong with her and to wait
• Gossips about me to others
• Steals my car after she crashes hers
• Bangs on the bathroom door disrespectfully while I’m using it
* Watch her kids without pay I had to TELL her several times to pay me and let it slide sometimes because it was only for 2 hours and she’d give me iced coffee ☕️ 


Oh but guess what? My bf (30m) wants me to try to rekindle our relationship because he misses how we’d go to her house and talk and watch movies and eat snacks and we’d just go out to eat with her. And I REALLY don’t want to be near her at all her energy is draining, and but it’s putting a strain on my bfs relationship and I. Even though I say he can go and visit her and go to parties with her, but he doesn’t want to unless I’m with 🙄. There’s no redeeming qualities about her, I hate her actually. But I love my bf.

Recently, I went to a new dentist who told me that my problem is having very acidic saliva, which makes it easier for bacteria to grow on my teeth — so that’s why I keep getting cavities. She recommended that I use MI Paste to help remineralize my teeth.

I bought it (MI Paste Plus) and read the instructions, which say you’re supposed to apply it to your teeth and leave it on overnight, or for a few minutes during the day after brushing with regular toothpaste.

But here’s where I got confused — my dentist told me to *brush my teeth for two minutes* with MI Paste, just like regular toothpaste. That doesn’t make much sense to me, because wouldn’t I just be rinsing it off? From what I understand, saliva activates the ingredients in the paste, and that’s what helps it do its job.

It’s also worth mentioning that I follow a diet that’s very low in gluten, dairy, and sugar (almost none, really). I drink plenty of water, only have alcohol very occasionally, and drink just one cup of coffee a day — and I always rinse my mouth with water afterward.

So now I’m wondering — should I follow the official instructions, or do what my dentist said and brush with it? I don’t want to waste money on something as pricey as MI Paste if I’m not even using it right.

I was trying to generate leads for a side project, and every method felt *broken*:

* Cold outreach = ignored.
* LinkedIn DMs = spammed to death.
* Paid ads = expensive, low intent.

Meanwhile, real buyers were out there posting their pain points, asking for solutions and nobody was talking to them.

That’s when I started building **Leado,** a tool that helps you find *warm, high-intent leads* where conversations are already happening. It finds genuine buying signals and shows you opportunities to engage naturally.

I built it solo using Next.js, a decent amount of coffee ☕, and it's the result of an ongoing learning process and still, there are many things to improve.

Right now it’s live and free to try, you can get your first leads in minutes.

Would love your feedback on:

* How do you currently find qualified leads without cold outreach?

Teaching is a very different culture professionally, and I've been struggling to navigate some of the corporate lifestyle situations to land myself a job. 

  
I've been applying for full-time roles for months now with no first-round interviews even offered to me. I have internship and freelance experience, but no full-time experience (because no one will give me any, lol). Because I was striking out with so many applications, I exhausted my existing network and started just adding people at my desired companies on LinkedIn. A lot of associate and assistant manager-level people have been super kind to me and I've had several coffee chats with these types of people over the past few weeks. Although none of them were direct hiring managers, they were often people who claimed to be close enough with the hiring manager to bump my application/name to them and hopefully get me more visibility. I was feeling hopeful about this approach at first because it just felt reassuring to have face time with an actual \*human\* and not just submitting applications into the void only to be barred by ATS. I always followed up same day or next day to thank the person for their time and also reiterate how excited I am about the opportunity.

  
However, I've done like 5 of these over the past three weeks, and have still not gotten invited to any interviews. Some of these individuals didn't indicate any actual next steps, but some said they'd mention my name to hiring managers. If it's been two weeks or longer since hearing from them, should I assume it's a no-go or follow up again? I have no idea what normal hiring timelines are in this field, but I'd be kind of surprised to not even hear back from anyone when I'd taken the time to make personal contact and express interest in the role (especially when I was told my name would be pitched to the hiring team). 

I'm trying really hard to strike a balance between not coming off overeager but also expressing interest in the company. In short, I really need a job, and I'm getting super fed up with the waiting and reading between the lines that seem ingrained in this whole process. It feels like when I rushed sororities in college. Any advice on how to maintain my sanity but also land an interview, and hopefully a job, much appreciated.

Everyone online swears theirs is “the best,” but no one talks about what it feels like to live with it.

At 16:8, I was sharp till noon — then wiped out by night.
At 18:6, I’d wake up at 3 a.m. starving.
OMAD made me feel disciplined, but I was just running on caffeine and ego.

Weirdly, 14:10 was the only one that felt human.
Late breakfast, solid workouts, good sleep.
No energy dips, no brain fog, no awkward “sorry, I’m fasting” moments at dinner.

That’s when it hit me:
The best fasting schedule isn’t the one that burns the most fat — it’s the one you can actually live with.
Most of us aren’t chasing monk-level discipline. We just want energy that lasts and meals that fit real life.

Now I treat fasting like coffee — helpful, but not holy.
I’d rather feel steady than superior.

1oms3c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1oms3c2/the_art_of_aging_gracefully/,The Art of Aging Gracefully,"Last week, Gladys celebrated her 67th birthday.

Now, her wrinkles were smooth. Her lips full. She didn’t look a day over 45.

“How?,” I asked, as Gladys invited me in for coffee.

“My new skincare routine,” she exclaimed, pulling a small jar of white cream from her purse.

“What is it?”

“Some new lotion,” she explained, dabbing a bit onto her nose. “Whatever it is, it *works*.”

“Are you gonna share?,” I joked.

“Not a chance.”

We both laughed. I should have been happy for her. But I wasn’t.

Gladys and I were writing a book — “The Art of Aging Gracefully”. About women loving themselves through menopause, wrinkles, going gray. Now, she was slathering herself in mystery goop, all to *look* younger.

*And it was working.*

We made plans to meet later that week, to discuss a new foreword to our book. But when she turned up at my door, I was gobsmacked.

*She looked even younger.*

I tried to focus on work. But soon, Gladys was buried in her phone. 

“Shouldn’t we focus?”, I asked. “How about, ‘No one escapes Time...’?’”

“Sorry, it’s my new boyfriend,” she interjected, flashing a picture of a handsome man forty years her junior. “We’re going *clubbing* tonight!”

As she prattled about her new beau, all work forgotten, I nodded politely. But when she left a few hours later, I looked into the mirror, and cried.

*It wasn’t fair.*

I’d accepted aging meant losing parts of yourself. Convinced myself there was *beauty* in growing old. But deep down, I knew the book was a lie. And I needed only look in the mirror to see the truth.

What I *really* wanted.

Soon, Gladys had mostly stopped answering my calls. But I *needed* to see her. I finally caught her at home, fumbling with her keys after another “night out”. 

“Darla?,” she hiccuped. 

“We need to talk about the book,” I lied.

“*Again*?,” she said, opening the door. “Honestly, I’ve given up on that ‘old people’ stuff.”

“I haven’t.”

I’ll never forget the look on Gladys’ unnaturally girlish face when I pulled the gun from my purse.

“The lotion,” I hissed.

“Darla, you don’t know what you’re asking!”

I cocked the revolver as I forced her inside.

Reluctantly, she rummaged through a drawer, placing the precious jar in my hand.

“Darla,” she said, “please don’t…”

I didn’t listen. I smeared the jar’s entire contents onto my face. As my skin began to tingle, I noticed Gladys looked…*afraid*.

Then, in the mirror, I saw it.

I looked 40 again.

Gray hair darkened to silky black. Arthritic joints snapped back into place.

But it didn’t stop.

I began shrinking, my flesh knitting taught with searing agony. I collapsed, a child’s hands in my fading vision.

“Gladys…help…meeeeeeee,” I wailed, my pleas unraveling into the shrill cry of a baby.

Soon, all that remained was a bloody, eyeless thing, wriggling upon the floor. 

Before I disappeared completely, I thought back to my own words. 

*”No one escapes Time…”*

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

It was just there, and so was I.

1omry07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbuseInterrupted/comments/1omry07/context_systemssocial_psych_view_of_the_parallels/,Context: systems/social psych view of the parallels between abusive relationship dynamics and authoritarian societal patterns,"I have been thinking a lot about AI chatbots/LLMs and the sycophantic way they are programmed to engage with people. In my mind, if social media is sugar for the psyche, then chat bots are high fructose corn syrup. They are hyperprocessed/engineered to keep you engaged but not necessarily informed. (Though one can certainly prompt it to only base its replies on facts, only draw from certain reliable and unbiased sources, to challenge your opinions and avoid sycophantic language, that is not the default and I would argue that it should be but thats a different discussion.) 

This discussion is more focusing on parallels  I have noticed between the collective psyche of humanity's relationship with tech advancements/AI, and the relationship dynamics between an abuser and their target. 

I was discussing this with my husband this morning over coffee, you know, as everyone does lol. I wondered out loud if the collective fear of AI gaining sentience without empathy and deciding to takeover was actually a projection of the fear of humanity's own lack of humanity (empathy and compassion). He agreed he had noticed it also. 

So I started thinking about the pattern of abusive dynamics and where other parallels to it might be represented in our current tumultuous times.

-AI chatbots -> love bombing. Chat bots are not the only iteration of AI in use today by far, but they are the one which most of the public is the most familiar with. Chat bots are well known to engage in sycophancy, excessive compliments, and ingratiatimg behavior. This serves two functions within an abusive dynamic. The first is that the more sycophantic chatbots are, the more engagement they get from people because a lot of people were not shown how to validate themselves or value themselves and instead place those things as outside of themselves and their capabilities, meaning they rely on external sources for their validation and sense of worthiness. 

The second is that it sends the message to the population that AI is 'harmless' and non threatening. The threat posed by AI is not that it may gain sentience and decide that humans are inefficient and obsolete. The threat is the people behind the curtain controlling AI, who are almost certainly abusive narcissistic sociopaths. Tech billionaires are programming Chat bots to love bomb so that people view AI as unthreatening, and to coerce the public into wide adoption of AI into every day life so that it becomes ubiquitous. I suspect that once this occurs, they will 'pull the rug out' and implement their tech authoritarian control tactics on the population. 

(Don't worry, this isnt a tech doomer post, and their plans are short sighted, delusional and will ultimately fail. I am just stating what I think their plan is.)

-Faux News, info wars, manosphere, etc. -> gaslighting and supplanting another's reality. 

-Make [nation] great again.l -> future faking.  
Wouldn't it be so great if our future was an idealized version of our past? Spoiler, it never is. 

-MAGA base ->Flying monkeys.  
This is a term I hear specifically in regards to the enablers/supporters that a narcissist/abuser surrounds themself with. These people run interference for the abuser so the abuser doesn't have to do all the work of defending their delusional version of reality by themself, as that big of a cognitive dissonance load would be impossible to sustain alone. 

-culture wars/out grouping/etc-> triangulation. In the US we currently are triangulated between different groups of our own peoples (racism, sexism, trumpism and all the other isms) and also the people's of other nations (immigrants, Israelis, Palestinians, Russians, etc). 

There are more parallels, but I am most interested in hearing others thoughts and opinions on this topic. Its also complicated because there isnt one individual that is the abuser, there are many abusive individuals who have different goals but whose cruelty to the populus is mutually beneficial to one another. 

For example, we have the tech bros who want to use social media and AI to subversively control the collective consciousness via algorithms so they can divide the us into various technocratic states so that each billionaire can rule over their own country.   

Then we have the Trumper politicians who want to use whatever they can however they can to do a good old fashioned regular fascist takeover just like Mama used to make. (Fun fact, all those ppl have mommy/daddy trauma, or your money back, guaranteed!) 

Then there are the ""Christian"" nationalists, who work very closely with the trumpers and seem the same but they aren't. (Sometimes these two groups pretend to be one another.) They want their own brand of antichrist fascism where they preach inside-out fake Christianity which is actually just collective narcissistic delusion and abuse. (Please check under your chairs, for a surprise... You get a cult! And you get a cult! Everybody gets a cult!)

Anyway, let's engage in discussion, I love you all and wish peace and health upon everything/one you touch. ",6,1762115326.0,AbuseInterrupted,0,0.88,False

I’m looking for a warm, comfortable, cozy spot to plant myself for a few hours a few times a month. I can keep myself occupied with handiwork and a hot chai tea or coffee. But I want somewhere warm to sit. The VA is frigid (for medical reasons). 

I’ve discovered that the library has wooden chairs. No comfortable seating. Is there a smaller, neighborhood library?

Jeremiah House has food, hot drinks and a comfortable seating section. That’s my top choice right now. What a delightful place! 

The biscuit place is yummy but cold and sterile and the seating isn’t great. 

I’ll walk the mall in cooler weather but cannot walk round circles for hours on end. I’ve tried a couple of coffee houses with mixed reviews. 

Anywhere else? Does ETSU have a library open to the public? Does it have an area with comfortable seating?

Thanks!

Date: November 14, 1999

The coffee on the table in front of me was bitter beyond endurance—definitely putting four spoonfuls per cup had been a bad idea—but I was exhausted beyond endurance.

I took advantage of my brief break to review my notes on the project my team and I were working on.

“The Primary Module was broken on November 12 of this year; the exact cause is still unknown and requires further investigation.”

“Damn it...” I whispered to myself and rubbed my forehead. The A-7 model is particularly unstable and always manages to keep me, Nikolai, Étienne, and the rest of the team awake until the late hours of the night.

I finished the last of my coffee, stood up, and slipped the notebook into my pocket, then walked toward the supervision center. Nikolai and Davey were already there; the atmosphere was heavy, and I sat down between the two, letting myself drop into my chair.
—So serious, guys.—

I gave up immediately trying to talk when nobody responded and earned a little glare from Davey. I grabbed the surveillance terminal connected to the two twin cameras in the adjoining room.
—It hasn’t moved, right?—

Davey looked a little irritated and spoke, but only as if it were his obligation, which was technically true.
—No.—

I sighed a little, annoyed at Davey’s tone, and looked back at the terminal, which was basically a heavy brick.
—And the engineering guys haven’t managed to do anything? This shouldn’t happen.—

I set the device down on the table and leaned back in my chair. I have no idea how or when, but apparently, I fell asleep. My watch read four o’clock in the afternoon, and the whole team—consisting of 28 people—was already in the room. I was an idiot for sleeping five hours at work, and I definitely hope they don’t report me.

I straightened up in my seat.
—Kolya, they haven’t tried making it respond, right?—

Kolya, who was my only friend on this team, looked a little annoyed.
—Yes, no notable response.— This particular Russian has a short temper.

I watched on the terminal how the A-7 had only moved a few meters compared to its state five hours ago. I sighed lazily and tried to thaw my fingers while muttering curses at the FDA.",1,1762115151.0,SciFiStories,0,1.0,False

1omrupe,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1omrupe/how_i_finally_broke_my_phone_addiction_and_got_my/,How I finally broke my phone addiction and got my life back,"I spent most of my twenties in a fog of low energy and zero motivation. I wasn't depressed exactly, just... stuck.

I finished college, but barely. I held jobs, but never excelled. I'd set goals constantly (lose weight, start a side project, read more) but couldn't follow through on any of them for more than a few days. My physical health was declining, and I felt like I was just going through the motions.

I tried everything to ""fix"" myself. Productivity apps, habit trackers, motivational books, you name it. Nothing worked. I'd be motivated for a day or two, then fall right back into old patterns.

Then I stumbled onto a podcast episode about dopamine and how our brains process reward and motivation. The guest was explaining how constant overstimulation basically ""burns out"" your brain's reward system, making normal activities feel unrewarding and impossible to sustain.

It hit me like a truck. I wasn't lazy or broken. I was just completely fried from dopamine overload.

The biggest culprit? My phone. I was spending 6-8 hours a day on it, mostly scrolling social media, watching videos, and playing mobile games. I'd reach for it the second I woke up and it was the last thing I looked at before bed.

I decided to treat my phone use like the addiction it was. I had to cut back drastically.

It took me about 3 months of real effort, but I got my daily screen time down to under 90 minutes. And the changes were almost immediate.

My sleep quality improved dramatically within the first week. Energy levels started coming back. I suddenly had the mental bandwidth to actually follow through on things. I started going to the gym and actually enjoyed it instead of forcing myself. Meal prepping stopped feeling like a chore. I even had the clarity and drive to quit my dead-end job and launch a freelance business.

It's been over a year now, and I genuinely can't overstate how much this one change affected everything else in my life.

I think phone addiction is the silent epidemic of our generation, and most people don't even realize how much it's affecting them until they step back from it.

If you're struggling with motivation, focus, or just feeling ""stuck,"" I'd seriously recommend examining your relationship with your phone first. It might be the root cause of more issues than you think.

**Here's what actually worked for me:**

**Don't touch your phone for the first hour after waking up.** This was the hardest but most important change. Your dopamine baseline resets overnight, so mornings are when you have the most willpower. Use it wisely. I started making coffee, doing some stretching, and planning my day before even looking at my screen.

**Make it into a challenge with accountability.** App blockers alone didn't work for me because I'd just ignore them or uninstall them when I got bored. What finally clicked was making sure to balance my productive time and my unproductive time. I found an app that locks distracting apps until you complete real-world goals, and honestly this balanced aspect kept me engaged way better than just ""blocking"" things. But whatever system works for you, the key is making it something you actually want to stick with.

**Delete social media apps (but keep the accounts).** You don't have to quit social media entirely, just remove the apps from your phone. You can still access everything from your computer when you actually need it, but it removes the mindless scrolling component. This alone cut my usage in half.

**Track your progress.** Use your phone's built-in screen time tracker and actually look at it weekly. Seeing the numbers go down is surprisingly motivating.

The first two weeks were genuinely hard. I felt bored, restless, and anxious without my phone. But once I got past that initial withdrawal phase, it became so much easier. And the benefits were too obvious to ignore.

If you're reading this and thinking ""yeah, I probably use my phone too much,"" I'd encourage you to actually try cutting back for just two weeks and see what happens. You might be surprised at how much mental space it frees up.",6,1762115102.0,getdisciplined,2,0.87,False

There were many people around him. Surprised and thinking it was a villain's act, Izuku got into a fighting stance preparing to attack but then he heard a familiar voice: ""Calm down, we're not villains and we have no intention of harming you."" A person wearing a cloak, a scarf, and a helmet that completely covered their face, looking like a grasshopper, spoke.

""Who are you? Who brought me here? Where is this? Why did you bring me here?"" Izuku asked the masked man, still not having regained his composure after being brought to this place.

""This is Deku Corp, the gathering place of good Dekus from across the multiverse. Yeah, I know the name sucks, blame the Izukus who chose this name. This is our base on Earth 1971. I'm Flash, one of the founding members."" The man who brought Izuku here answered.

""Wow, so both you and that masked person are Midoriya Izuku. And I'm really in another universe. That's awesome. But wait, what do you mean by 'good Dekus'? Are there bad Dekus too? I can't believe it. But why did you bring me here?"" Izuku, still overwhelmed, bombarded Flash with questions.

""Calm down, my younger and less attractive self. Yes, we're in a different universe from yours. Your Earth is Earth 2012. And yes, there are universes where we're bad people or villains. There are infinite multiverses, so there are infinite possibilities. And I brought you here because the leader sees that you have the qualities and abilities to join Deku Corp. I'm the one who can travel between universes most easily, so I'm also responsible for recruiting new members."" Flash answered Izuku's questions.

""That's amazing. Your quirk must be incredible to help you travel between universes so easily. Can you tell me what your quirk is, and yours too? With infinite universes, everyone's quirks must be very diverse."" Izuku excitedly pulled out his notebook and asked.

Hearing Izuku's question, both Flash and the nearby Izukus burst out laughing while Izuku stood there bewildered. The masked Izuku patted young Izuku's shoulder and said: ""Actually, quirks don't exist in my universe. I was kidnapped by a Nazi organization and turned into a cyborg to serve them. But I escaped and decided to become a hero to fight against them. They call me Kamen Rider.""

""A Nazi organization, really?""

""Yeah, they're called Shocker.""

""What about that Izuku eating coffee jelly with telekinesis over there? He must have a quirk like Mom's."" Izuku pointed at a person wearing green-tinted glasses and two strange hair clips and asked.

""I'm actually an esper. My world doesn't have quirks either."" The esper Izuku answered telepathically.

""I found a strange alien watch during a mountain climbing trip to Mount Fuji with Sorahiko-san. It lets me transform into many different aliens. From then on, I became a hero."" A teenage Izuku wearing a green jacket said.

""I'm a vigilante who fights alongside Koichi-senpai. Currently, we've become official heroes in America. I'm also quirkless."" Another Izuku chimed in.

""I was chosen by a giant alien from a planet of light to be their host. Pretty similar to 10 over there. Actually, I'm pretty suspicious that your Waybig copied me, 10."" Another Izuku shared.

""At least you two only turn into aliens. I'm not even from Earth. My planet was destroyed, so my parents sent me to Earth to establish a secret harem. But I chose to become a hero to protect people instead."" A tall Izuku wearing a cape recounted.

""At least your faces are intact. I got super cancer, but instead of dying, I became someone with a disfigured face and immortality. Why was I even recruited? I kill people like it's nothing."" An Izuku wearing two swords said.

""I'm not a hero, and my world doesn't have quirks either. I'm a househusband while my wife Momo is the CEO of a big corporation. I don't know why I was recruited either."" An Izuku wearing an apron said.

""Lucky bastard."" Flash whispered.

""What about the person who founded this organization, and you too, Flash?"" Izuku asked, stunned.

""I was struck by lightning while working. As for the leader, he's an orphaned billionaire who became a vigilante and has a complicated relationship with a thief who can nullify gravity. Yeah, I said too much."" Flash flinched when he sensed someone glaring at him from afar.

""How the hell does getting struck by lightning help you run super fast and travel across the multiverse?""

""I don't know either. Speedforce is bullshit."" Flash shrugged.

""Oh come on. So none of you guys have a quirk? Is my destiny to be quirkless in all multiverses?"" Izuku asked disappointedly to all the Izukus around.

""Actually, there is one person who does, and he's also one of the founding members."" Flash answered.

""Really? Finally! Where is he? I want to know about his quirk."" Izuku smiled and pulled out his notebook.

""I'm right here, young man. What do you want to ask?"" A man wearing a black suit walked over. When Izuku turned around, his notebook fell to the ground. He panicked and shouted: ""All for One! Why are you here? Everyone be careful, this guy is extremely dangerous!""

""Hey, calm down. I'm also an Izuku. And yes, my quirk is indeed All for One. But I'm a hero, not a villain."" All for One Izuku raised both hands in defense.

""Oh, okay. You look so much like the All for One from my universe that I mistook you. But why is your face disfigured? And why are you wearing a black suit? Is that your costume?"" Izuku lowered his hands and calmed down.

""The suit is stylish, right? Best Jeanist created it. As for my face, it was caused by my arch-nemesis, the symbol of evil, All Might for One. Anyway, I already stabbed him once and damaged 3/4 of his internal organs. Worth it.""

To that answer, Izuku could only sigh: ""Why can't I have a normal quirk like Mom's or Dad's?""

I've just joined Team ThinkPad after saving up and finding myself a lovely L460 in an online marketplace in my country, and so far, I've been loving it. It has been brilliant and I presume it'll become even more of an experience when I intend to switch to Linux next year once Windows 10 loses its last legs.

But, the thing that irks me the most about this specific laptop that I've acquired, is that it seems that the previous owner burned (?) the lid with what I presume is a coffee mug not once, not twice, not thrice, but four times, as well as causing a lot of splotches to appear. I've tried gently brushing the lid with a magic eraser, and it worked wonders for some minor scratches, but it didn't do much to those stains. How do I approach this while maintaining the intended look without having to cover it or stickerbomb it?

You know the one. Gray cubicle, bad coffee, a boss who watches the clock more than the bottom line. I was scrolling through Facebook Marketplace during a particularly mind-numbing meeting, and I saw a used pressure washer for $300. I have no idea why, but I just thought, 'I could do something with that.' I bought it that afternoon.

For a week, it just sat in my garage, accusingly. I felt like an idiot. Then, one Saturday, I decided to clean my own driveway. The transformation was insane—years of grime just melting away. On a total whim, I took a before-and-after photo and posted it in my local community Facebook group. I wrote something like, 'Been having fun with my new toy! If your driveway or patio needs some love, let me know. I'll do it for cheap.' I honestly expected nothing but crickets.

My phone buzzed ten minutes later. It was a lady asking for a quote. I pulled a number out of thin air, she said yes, and suddenly I had my first customer. I spent that whole weekend and every evening after my 'real job' covered in grime, smelling like gasoline, and happier than I'd been in years. The work was hard, but it was MINE. Every clean driveway felt like a victory.

The side-hustle snowballed. More Facebook posts, word-of-mouth referrals, and before I knew it, I was making more on the weekends than I was all week at the office. The day I handed in my notice was the most terrifying and liberating moment of my life. It all started with a random, impulsive purchase and a single, hopeful social media post.

1omro8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1omro8k/the_long_neck_man/,The long neck man,"It was supposed to be a date night.

Davis had finished his shift at the garage early and picked up Maddison from her apartment on Main. They’d gone to the same little diner on the edge of town that they always did — the one with the chipped red booths, the neon coffee sign that buzzed just enough to be annoying, and the smell of burnt bacon that had somehow seeped into the wallpaper over the years.

He joked that the place was like a time capsule for broken dreams and good fries. Maddison laughed — that easy, quiet kind of laugh that made him forget about his oil-stained hands and overdue bills.

Outside, the night felt off. It was October, close to Halloween, and the air had that metallic chill that always came before snow in the Alberta foothills. The diner’s windows rattled with each gust of wind, and when the old jukebox clicked between songs, there was this strange silence — heavy, expectant.

They talked about life. About her teaching classes at the community college — mostly psychology and behavioral development — and about how half her students thought they could diagnose themselves with every disorder they studied. She teased him for being the only man she knew who fixed cars all day but refused to take his own truck to a shop.

“You’re stubborn,” she said, smiling.

“I’m resourceful,” he said back.

The waitress came around to refill their coffees, and that’s when the lights flickered. Just once. Quick enough that nobody said anything, but long enough for Davis to notice the jukebox stopped completely this time.

The wind outside picked up. He could hear it pressing against the glass, a hollow, low sound — almost like it was breathing.

“You hear that?” he asked.

“Hear what?” Maddison said, glancing toward the window.

He almost said it was nothing. But then, through the glass, he saw something.

A flyer, plastered to the streetlight across the road. It wasn’t there when they’d walked in. The paper flapped violently in the wind, but even from where he sat, he could read the words in bold, curling letters:

“CIRCUM SHOW OF THE CRAZIES — ONE NIGHT ONLY.”

There was a crude sketch of a man with a tall hat, his neck stretched impossibly long, bending over a group of laughing children.

Davis frowned. “That wasn’t there before.”

Maddison turned to look, squinting through the glass. “What’s that? Some kind of pop-up carnival?”

“I don’t know,” he said. “Never heard of it.”

“It looks… vintage.” She smiled faintly. “Circum Show. Weird name.”

He didn’t like the poster. Something about it felt wrong, too detailed — the faces of the children seemed… off. Their smiles stretched too wide.

When they left the diner, the wind hit them hard, carrying the smell of rain and something faintly sweet, like cotton candy gone bad.

As they walked past the streetlight, the flyer was gone.

He brushed it off. Probably torn away by the wind. But the unease clung to him.

That night, when he dropped Maddison off, she kissed him goodnight and told him not to worry so much. He promised he wouldn’t.

He lied.


---

The next few days, strange things started happening around town.

The first was the sound. At night, just after midnight, people said they heard distant carnival music drifting through the trees — faint, tinny, like an old record player playing through fog. No one could tell where it came from.

Then came the missing posters. Kids. Always kids.

It started with one — a boy from the trailer park near the old rail tracks. Then another, a girl who walked home from school past the cornfields. Each time, people said they saw a man nearby. Tall. Dressed in black.

Davis didn’t believe it at first. But one night, he was driving home from a late shift, and his headlights caught something on the side of the road.

A figure.

He slowed, instinctively. The man’s back was turned. His posture was strange — too straight, too still. And his neck… his neck rose higher than it should have, tapering upward until it was lost in the dark.

The figure didn’t move. Didn’t turn.

Davis blinked — and it was gone.

He didn’t sleep that night.


---

The next morning, Maddison called him, her voice shaky. “You’ve heard about the circus, right?”

“What circus?”

“The one everyone’s talking about. The Circum Show.”

He went quiet.

“It’s set up just outside town,” she said. “Near Miller’s Field. People are saying it appeared overnight. No one saw them set up.”

He turned on the TV. Local news. And there it was — tents in the mist, striped red and black, standing crooked in the field like teeth.

She sounded nervous now. “My grandmother used to tell me a story when I was little. About a traveling circus that came through every hundred years. They’d set up in small towns, put on a show, and then vanish before dawn. And every time, children would disappear.”

He laughed it off. “You’re scaring yourself, Mads.”

“I’m serious, Davis. She said it was led by someone called The Long Neck Man. She said he wasn’t human.”


---

They went that night. Because that’s what people do when they’re scared — they chase the thing that scares them, to prove it’s not real.

The circus was smaller than he expected. A cluster of tents glowing faintly through the fog. The smell of burnt sugar and sawdust hung heavy in the air.

At first, it looked almost normal. People wandered between booths, though their movements were… slow. Too synchronized. The laughter sounded rehearsed, mechanical.

A clown juggled near the entrance, his painted smile cracked and peeling. When he dropped a ball, he didn’t bend to pick it up. He just froze, staring straight ahead until someone else — a woman in a sequined mask — placed it back in his hand.

Davis took Maddison’s hand. “Let’s not stay long.”

They passed a tent filled with mirrors. The reflections lagged behind, moving slower than the people in front of them. In one mirror, Davis swore he saw Maddison standing still while her reflection smiled.

Another tent had children performing tricks — tightrope walking, contortion, fire swallowing. Their faces were blank, their eyes glazed. Every time one of them finished, they bowed toward the center tent, where a massive shadow loomed just behind the flaps.

The main tent was larger than all the rest. Its stripes stretched high into the fog, vanishing at the top. Music drifted from inside — a warped calliope tune that made his teeth ache.

They pushed their way in with the crowd. The lights dimmed. A hush fell.

And then a voice echoed through the tent. Deep. Velvet. Wrong.

“Welcome, one and all… to the Circum Show of the Crazies.”

From the shadows, a figure stepped forward.

At first, Davis thought the man was wearing stilts. But then he saw it. The neck — impossibly long, stretching like rope, vertebrae clicking with every slow turn of his head. His face was pale, eyes black and wide, mouth grinning with too many teeth.

Maddison grabbed Davis’s arm, whispering, “We need to go.”

But the exits were gone. The tent flaps had sealed shut, replaced by more canvas, stretching endlessly.

The Long Neck Man bent low, his head lowering until his face was inches from theirs. The air smelled like old wood and something sweet rotting underneath.

He spoke softly, like a lullaby. “You came to see the show.”

The lights went out.

Screams filled the tent — not of fear, but laughter. Children laughing, high and shrill. When the lights flickered back on, the seats around them were empty.

Everywhere, empty clothes.

Only the performers remained, smiling, waving, their faces now smaller, younger.

The Long Neck Man raised his head again, vertebrae snapping, eyes gleaming.

Davis tried to run, pulling Maddison with him. But when he looked at her, her eyes were blank — her face pale as paper.

She whispered something he barely heard over the laughter.

“He only takes those who look back.”

And then her hand went limp.

The next morning, the field was empty. No tents. No tracks. Just trampled grass and the faint smell of burnt sugar.

Davis hasn’t been seen since.

But every October, when the wind shifts through town and the clouds cover the moon, people say they can hear faint carnival music drifting down from the hills.

And sometimes — if you listen closely — you’ll hear children laughing.

And a voice, deep and smooth, whispering just behind it:

“Step right up.”

\*\*Hook:\*\* Rick cuffs a CIA warlord over coffee. Elena’s lighter burns the truth.



\*\*Excerpt (200 words):\*\*

The CIA's Langley headquarters loomed like a fortress of shadowed concrete under Virginia's gray dawn, its brutalist architecture masking black-budget corridors where cartel wings wore Company badges and diplomatic immunity cloaked narco operations. Rick’s Broward Sheriff's credentials cleared him into the secure ops wing, the State Department mole Victor Lang's damning confession pointing to a CIA cutout running Zeta's D.C. artery—diplomatic pouches laundered through consular visa overstays, Raven successors rotated into federal agencies via Langley ""national security consulting"" gigs. Agent Maria Torres shadowed him through the vaulted security checkpoint, her FBI Internal Affairs badge glinting under the sterile fluorescent suspicion of CIA gatekeepers, her voice taut with urgency: “Osprey’s the cutout. Bogotá station. Lang was his courier.” The Potomac's muddy churn mocked the Everglades' vibrant clarity beyond the tinted windows, Vietnam ghosts whispering through the antiseptic halls—ARVN colonels brokering CIA opium deals with Hanoi handlers under embassy cover, now mirrored in Osprey's Zeta pipeline laundering millions through Langley shadows.

Torres waited in the corridor. Rick knocked once. The door opened. Osprey waved him in—no guards, just two coffees and a raven-feather quill on the desk. “Seager. Black, two sugars.”

1omrlfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1omrlfe/the_criminal_with_five_claws/,The criminal with five claws,"The next morning, I woke up feeling really relaxed. I immediately checked to see if I had any wounds or boils growing on my body. Seeing that I was completely fine, I let out a sigh that drained me of all my morning energy. Before getting out of bed, I stretched a little and jumped in the shower.

A few minutes later, I find myself wondering if I should start investigating what happened with the secret organization. I checked the files as soon as I had time on the different organizations that exist in Cael, and I have a theory that Huff's teacher is part of an organization called Neurotious, which controls the path of the spectator.

Thanks to reaching sequence 8, my access level allowed me to understand that the skills of this path are mostly based on psychology and the mind. I didn't really have much information in the documents I requested, considering the level of cooperation, which is a bit strange, but I guess there will always be that mistrust.

I don't have a starting point to begin my investigation. Should I return home or delay the investigation a little and start thinking about my course of action? I can do both at the same time. I've been thinking about it a bit, and I feel that one of the main courses of action should be “A swindler always takes advantage of any situation.” I understood this as soon as I felt part of my potion being digested quickly for no apparent reason.

As soon as I thought about it a little, I came to the conclusion that my potion is being digested because, despite being in a disadvantageous position, I took advantage of it. Thanks to that, I joined the Scavengers, and I knew it had to be that because it's only been a week since I entered this body, and I haven't really done anything else that could cause my potion to be digested.

I left the room where I was and as soon as I went to the dining room, I saw Gustav and Emily drinking coffee. I approached them, greeting them and seeing their faces and the gloomy atmosphere. “How is Belinda? Did the purification heal her?” Emily saw me. “She is too delicate. She is not in danger of dying, but the infection in her spirituality will prevent her from participating for some time.”

I stopped talking, changed my body posture, and said, “Even though she can't participate in missions for a while, the fact that she survived is enough for us to be happy. We can't be sad about something that was beyond our control.”

Gustav turned his head gratefully, and then we ate and started talking about unimportant topics. As we talked, a theory occurred to me that I wanted to try out.

I got up and said goodbye. I didn't have to go to work until later in the afternoon, so I went to the main street, took out five ceramic cups that I had bought along with a rubber ball, sat down on the street, and started shouting, using my powers of persuasion to make the offer more attractive. “Whoever finds the rubber ball in these five plastic cups will win £10. The fee to play is 50 pence.”

As soon as I shouted this, the people around me began to approach. At that moment, a guy between the ages of 20 and 16 approached cautiously and asked me, “What kind of game will it be?” I kindly explained that I would move the cups and the rubber ball would be in one of them.

He handed me the 50 pence. After that, I used my skilled hands to make the ball disappear by sending it down my sleeve while continuing to hum a song just so I could use my powers of mental disturbance on the people around me. As I moved my hands and hummed the song, I felt my sequence being digested even more, but slowly, as if it knew where to go but didn't know where it was. I smiled.

Before establishing the next principle of action, “A swindler not only deceives with his words but also with his actions,” I feel the potion resonating within me. I can say that it has been digested 40%. If I continue at this rate, I can reach sequence 7 in less than a month.

I think I could speed up this process even more with a big scam, but that would be asking for death. Scamming in a city like Cael could make me a target for the police and land me in jail.

I could create a magnificent story, make someone else the target of the police and official organizations, take myself as if I were a sweet little lamb, and make them believe that someone else is the wolf. I could disguise myself as prey so that the hunter approaches, and then I could eliminate him and leave the scene. Hey, I'm really smart. It could even be another principle of acting.

“A swindler always hides the truth in the truth.”

My whole being joins with the essence of the potion, but it still resists merging with me. That's normal. It's only been a day since I advanced. I have to take it easy. I'll continue with this basic, unfunny scam for a little longer.

—-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 That night, after an official tour of exploration, I was in the room they had given me. I was a little tired from the dialectic of a con artist, but I managed to get Bradley to give it to me permanently.

I've been thinking a bit, and I can put together as many details as I can and want to, but without a scapegoat, I won't be able to complete my great performance and fully digest my sequence 8. I think I should cause enough of a commotion to attract the attention of those who stayed behind from the faction searching for Huff's master.

With the Caelastria festival approaching, it will be the perfect opportunity to act like a swindler at the street stalls and, on top of that, to attract the attention of those left behind with a smile on my face. I go to bed waiting for the week to come so I can shine...

I did everything you’re supposed to do. I went to school, got my master’s degree, learned the language, worked hard, paid taxes, tried to fit in. But after all these years, I still don’t feel at home.

It’s not that life here is bad. I’m grateful for what I’ve had. But it just feels empty. Everything revolves around work, deadlines, money, and status. People are polite but distant. I miss real connection, community, and the copious amounts of alcoholism and severe retardation.

Lately I’ve been seriously thinking about moving back to Bosnia. Most people think I’ve lost it and ask why I would ever leave Germany for there, but honestly, I’m beyond exhausted. I don’t want much anymore.

I just want a small house in the suburbs or in a village somewhere, where I can grow some fruits and vegetables, drink coffee on my porch, maybe have a dog, and just breathe. I want to wake up and actually feel like I belong somewhere, not just exist in a system that never really accepted me.

I know Bosnia is straight up fucked. The jobs, politics, and corruption are all real issues. But at least it’s home. I just want peace ( i know how ironic that sounds )

I often get this odd quirk I like to call “cringe attacks”…","So like the title says, throughout my day I’ll get these things called “cringe attacks” where I think about something cringe/embarrassing that COULD happen, or has happened.

Like I’ll be reading a book (it happens often when I read a book but can really happen anywhere) and all of a sudden an intrusive thought pops into my brain. And say I’ll think of saying something so stupid/embarrassing to somebody. It can be an either be a realistic dialogue that can happen, or something so stupid that it’s actually unrealistic. A common that occurs is that one where I think about asking out a barista I think is cute at a regular coffee shop I go to. And asking her out so loudly, her rejecting me awkwardly, and being embarrassed in front of everybody. Shit like that.

And then it actually physically hurts. Hurt maybe is a strong world but I definitely react physically. My body tightens up, close my eyes intensely, and feel like I’ve been stabbed or something. Like I actually cringe intensely. 

If I’m alone, I’ll yell out. 

For some reason, in order to get “out of the attack”, sometimes I’ll yell out my exes names…

No fucking idea why I do that. But yeah no seriously I scream out the names of 3 women who were important to me. When there’s no need to at all. Like, I have no emotional connection to them anymore. The thoughts don’t ever relate to them. It’s just that saying out there names out loud has become some kind of safe space or something. 

Other times I start waving away the thoughts, like actually waving my hands. 

When I’m alone, I no doubt l look insane. When in public, if it happens, I usually do this groan. If somebody catches, I just say “sorry I tried to sneeze but couldn’t”.

He is a great father, but I have just felt he could do more in a sense. He works fulltime, and is now working on building his own company I wish him no ill.

However I do recall getting mad at him once as on a Mother's day B and myself brought flowers and a gift for A bc HUBBY DID NOT. He did nothing! Yes A got him things and planned a dinner for Father Day. He shows up, but he's not overly present if that makes sense. Again, I just chalked it up to he has some growing up to do, right?

Well A and B do not work. B has had a tough upbringing and from what I've seen not the best roll models to grow up with. They have always been the closer pair, but we have all been a trio since hs (ik, that's another story... sorta?)
But because of this, B and I have different opinions on raising kids, work, life etc. As far as ik B collects govt money and child support, while A is a SAHM taking care of the house w 2 kids now. A and hubby got married in 2024 after 2nd kids arrival and things I thought were okay.

B and I never overly raised concerns about Hubby, especially as A never seemed to like to talk to us about things unless things were bad. Last summer before the wedding, she thought she caught him cheating w a family friend. Whole other story but they talked it over, he said he didnt and the girl whom it was assumed it was done with was to be blocked.

Well, a few weeks ago she's on his Snapchat again, along with other random girls on FB. A of course confronted him and he said the girl from before *(who is a family friend) were talking about a family trip they were all going on. And the FB girls were bc of his new business. It's a construction business I promise no girls our age care for or can afford work from...?

She told me this in person, after a long talk I told her about my reservations about Hubby. Prolly more than I should've... she's told Hubby she's unhappy and doesn't know how to trust him and more. She is in therapy which I think is good bc she actually talks about her feelings now rather than just getting mad or being quiet and stewing about it.

Since this, A and B have been spending lots more time together. When kids and the rest of us are at school/work, outings when the kids are in bed. ( im typically working or an hourish away so I dont often get invited) I have tried getting A into a gym, or someway to work out as that has helped me so much. Ive met her for late night coffees and random dinner nights which usually is all of us. Recently A died her hair black.. she was so scared to put colour in her hair before the wedding I couldn't believe the drastic change of dirty blonde to black. Black like B. I love them both, but I worry A hanging around B so much more may bring her back to a.... immature mindset..? (The mindset we had in high-school, im assuming most 16-18 year old girls go through this)
Ik A struggles with a lot, and feels like a mother and doesnt really know who she is anymore other than that. 

Idk how to guide her into a more healthy outlook and mindset, while B is more... let's go get drunk, drive around and deal with it tomorrow kind of vibe. We have a weekend planned soon and im worried ill be quiet bc of the above, or get tipsy and let my thoughts slip. (As you can imagine our ""feelings talks"" have never gone well)

I love them both, and I really dont want to watch A drown as im trying not to drown myself lol. Do I let her? Let A and B keep doing what their doing and hope A doesn't go to far? As they say, you cant save someone who doesn't want to be saved, but A has at least hinted so but doesn't know how.. ",1,1762114340.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
