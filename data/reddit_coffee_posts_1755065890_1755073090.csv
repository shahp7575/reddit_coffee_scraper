Humidity‚Äôs starting to dip, the weather‚Äôs all over the place, and your beard is along for the ride whether it likes it or not. One day it‚Äôs sticky and hot, and you‚Äôre sweating before you‚Äôve even finished your coffee.  
The next, you step outside and there‚Äôs a crisp breeze that makes your skin feel tight before you hit the driveway.  
  
We‚Äôre in that awkward in-between season where your beard can go from soft and hydrated to dry and wiry overnight.

For guys who like to keep things simple, this is where it can get a little tricky. You can‚Äôt always just set one beard routine and run it on autopilot until winter. Conditions are variable. The air‚Äôs still warm enough to pull moisture out, but not always humid enough to give much back. Your beard might need more one day and less the next.

So this week, we‚Äôre breaking down how to adapt your beard care for the dog days.  
We‚Äôll talk about what‚Äôs changing, what tools you actually need, how to adjust your daily routine without overcomplicating it, and why this is the perfect time to start prepping for September... better known around here as the official start of **beard season**.

# So, What‚Äôs Changing Right Now?

As we've taught before, beard hair is hygroscopic, so it naturally absorbs and releases water depending on the environment. This is why humidity matters so much.

* **Lower humidity** means your beard can‚Äôt pull as much water from the air. The result is hair that feels drier, cuticle scales are lifted, and frizz becomes more noticeable.
* **Unpredictable weather** can mean a hot, sweaty day followed by a cool, dry evening. Those swings can mess with your skin barrier and sebaceous balance.
* **Lingering sun exposure** still counts. Just because the calendar says ‚Äúlate summer‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean UV damage is off the table. Too much sun can weaken the cuticle, fade natural pigment, and increase brittleness.

This is why your beard might feel softer some mornings and rougher the next, because your environment is constantly shifting, and your routine needs to shift with it. So let's build it...

# The Dog Days Daily Beard Routine

As always, you don‚Äôt need 12 products. You don‚Äôt need to overthink it. But you *do* need to be consistent and responsive to what your beard is telling you each day. So let's build your routine.

**Morning baseline (every single day)**

1. **Cleanse.** As we always say, use a good soap or wash, but limit to 3 times per week or so. The focus here is balance. 
2. **Slightly dampen.** Splash water on your beard and towel dry until it‚Äôs just slightly damp. This unlocks the hair‚Äôs aqueous layer and preps it for oil.
3. **Apply beard oil.** 5-10 drops of a well-formulated beard oil. Rub between your palms, work it into your beard, and comb through to distribute.
4. **Target with balm if needed.** If you‚Äôve got problem areas that you'd like to train, or you know the day will be windy or dry, use balm in those spots for control and protection.

# Adapting on Dry Days vs Humid Days

**Cooler, drier days:**

* Add a touch more oil than usual.
* Balm becomes more useful. Apply it after oil to slow transepidermal water loss, especially in exposed areas like the chin and sideburns.

**Warmer, humid days:**

* Stick to oil only. Balm can block ambient moisture absorption in high humidity.
* Focus on keeping the beard clean and rinsed. Humidity + sweat can accelerate buildup and dull the hair, and cause issues with your lipid barrier and acid mantle. 

**In-between days (mild temps, moderate humidity):**  
This is the tricky middle ground, when it‚Äôs not necessarily dry, but not sticky hot either. These are the days and climates where you want to fine-tune without overdoing it.

* Oil as usual. 5-10 drops on a slightly damp beard.
* Light balm if needed. Only in trouble spots for shape or training, not all-over.
* Focus on balance. These days can swing either way, so pay attention to how your beard feels midday. If it feels rough or wiry by the afternoon, you may feel like you need a tiny reapplication of oil. That's fine to do!
* Watch your wash frequency as normal.
* Evening check-in. On these middle-ground days, it‚Äôs a good habit to run your fingers through your beard at night. If it feels dry, a small amount of oil before bed can keep you from waking up with a brittle, frizzy beard.

# Your Dog Days Beard Care Toolkit

* **Beard oil** \- Your foundation. Promotes hydration, nourishes, and keeps skin barrier and hair structure balanced.
* **Balm** \- For targeted styling, control, and moisture retention in dry air.
* **Comb** \- Distributes product evenly, detangles, and aligns hair.
* **Good beard soap** \- Cleanses excess sebum and buildup without nuking the skin barrier

# Adjusting on the Fly

* **Dry air / windy day?** Oil + balm.
* **Humidity spike?** Oil only, let the air help hydrate.
* **Outdoor work?** Cleanse at night and reapply oil before bed.
* **Unexpected plans?** Quick rinse, re-oil, comb-through, and a touch of balm where needed.

Late August is the warm-up for the real seasonal shift. By September, nights get cooler, indoor heating starts creeping back in, and the air pulls more moisture from your beard.

That‚Äôs where **beard butter** shines, for that deep conditioning, elasticity repair, and overnight recovery. Think of oil as the daily driver, balm as the steering control, and butter as the full-service garage visit. We're almost there, y'all!

So, use these tips to adjust your routine on the fly. Knowing what to use and how to use it and save you from throwing your whole game out of whack. Plus, it'll keep your beard soft and lustrous all year.

# Best Raw Cane Sugar 2025: Sweeten Your Life!

Raw cane sugar is a minimally processed sweetener derived directly from sugarcane juice. It retains more of the natural molasses found in sugarcane compared to refined white sugar, giving it a distinctive flavor and color. The demand for raw cane sugar has increased substantially as consumers seek healthier and more natural alternatives to processed sugars. it's a versatile ingredient that can be used in baking, beverages, and a variety of culinary applications.This article delves into the best raw cane sugar options available in 2025, highlighting their key features, benefits, and ideal uses.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of the best raw cane sugar depends largely on specific preferences, including considerations like granulation, color, and molasses content. A high-quality raw cane sugar should offer a pleasant, subtly sweet taste without overpowering the flavor of the dish or beverage it's used in.

**Granulation:** The granulation of raw cane sugar refers to the size and consistency of the sugar crystals. Finer granules dissolve more easily in liquids, making them ideal for beverages and delicate baked goods. Coarser granules provide a satisfying crunch and are often preferred for topping desserts or adding texture to cookies and muffins. The best raw cane sugars offer a consistent granulation throughout the package.

**Color:** The color of raw cane sugar is a direct indicator of its molasses content. Lighter-colored sugars have been processed more, resulting in less molasses. Darker sugars, conversely, retain more molasses, offering a richer, more complex flavor profile. The ideal color depends on the intended use. As an example, a lighter sugar may be preferred for subtly sweetening coffee, while a darker sugar can enhance the caramel notes in baked goods.**Molasses Content:** Molasses content significantly influences the flavor, aroma, and nutritional value of raw cane sugar. Molasses is a rich source of minerals like iron,calcium,and potassium.Sugars with a higher molasses content have a bolder, more robust flavor reminiscent of caramel or toffee. Consumers seeking a sweetener with added nutritional benefits often prioritize raw cane sugars with a notable molasses presence.

Key features defining top-tier raw cane sugar include:

 Even, uniform granulation for consistent performance.
 A range of color options, allowing for tailored sweetness and depth of flavor.
 A noticeable, but not overwhelming, molasses aroma.
 Sustainable sourcing and ethical production practices.

## Core benefits

Raw cane sugar offers distinct advantages over highly refined white sugar, appealing to health-conscious consumers and culinary enthusiasts alike. Its natural flavor profile and reduced processing contribute to a more wholesome and satisfying sweetening experience.

**Enhanced flavor:** The presence of molasses in raw cane sugar imparts a subtle, complex flavor that is often described as caramel-like or toffee-like. This adds depth and richness to foods and beverages that is missing in refined white sugar, enhancing the overall sensory experience. For example, using raw cane sugar in chocolate chip cookies can create a more nuanced and flavorful cookie compared to using white sugar alone.

**Nutritional Value:** Raw cane sugar retains trace amounts of minerals and antioxidants that are stripped away during the refining process of white sugar.While the quantities are small, these micronutrients contribute to a more nutritionally complete sweetener. as an example, the iron content in molasses can be beneficial for individuals seeking to increase their iron intake naturally.

**Digestive Comfort:** Some individuals find that they tolerate raw cane sugar better than highly refined white sugar. While more research is needed,the presence of natural enzymes and fibers in molasses may contribute to easier digestion and reduced gastrointestinal discomfort. this is notably relevant for individuals with sensitive digestive systems who are looking for a less processed sweetener option.

## FAQs Section

**How should raw cane sugar be stored?**

Raw cane sugar should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. Proper storage prevents the sugar from clumping or absorbing moisture, preserving its quality and flavor for an extended period.A pantry or cupboard works well.

**Is raw cane sugar a healthier alternative to white sugar?**

While raw cane sugar retains some minerals and has a slightly lower glycemic index than white sugar, it is indeed still a form of sugar and should be consumed in moderation. It offers some nutritional advantages but should not be considered a health food. It is always important to consider total sugar intake as part of a healthy diet.

**Can raw cane sugar be substituted for white sugar in recipes?**

Yes, raw cane sugar can generally be substituted for white sugar in most recipes on a 1:1 basis.Though, keep in mind that the molasses content may slightly alter the taste and color of the final product. If a lighter color or more neutral flavor is desired, a lighter-colored raw cane sugar or a blend of raw cane sugar and white sugar can be used.

So for context I‚Äôll give a bit of background. I (22 F) had a child of my own when I was 18. I met my partner (30 M) when I was 19 and he was 27 because his parents are family friends. We didn‚Äôt get together straight away- we met early summer time and were friends until November when our friendship developed into something more. It was a long distance relationship since we lived 3 hours apart. He would take the train up to see me or I‚Äôd take the train with my son down to see him.
   At the time I was living in temporary accommodation awaiting to be housed‚Ä¶ in late December I was housed and it was not a good environment (mould infested and people doing dr*gs in the same flat block causing shouting, screaming and smells). My partner suggested moving down south to be near him. I found somewhere near my partner and we decided that he‚Äôd move with us too since he lived with his parents. A few months into living together he decided he‚Äôd like to take on my son as his own, which I agreed to- he was really good with my son and his biological father decided to not be involved when my son was very young.
So we did move quite quickly with our relationship, I know that. 
  Fast forward 3 years and we have our own (biological) child together who is 1 and we have moved back to my home town because it was far too expensive to live down south. 
   My issue now‚Ä¶ when we moved I said to my partner I‚Äôd start working because he‚Äôd said on many occasions that he wanted to be the stay at home parent and I agreed because when he was working he‚Äôd earn and I‚Äôd see little to no contribution financially. 
  I managed to find a job working in a fast food chain restaurant and I now work 30-40 hours a week. My partner wanted to also start his own business, working days that I don‚Äôt work as a handy man- doing gardening and general handy man jobs. We have funding for getting children into childcare in this country but the problem was that we only became able to get the funding after this terms funding deadline. So I pay ¬£150 a week for my son to go in to nursery two days a week and my daughter to go in one day a week. Which frees up my partner to work one extra day a week. 
  So I‚Äôll give last week as an example Monday I worked 6am- 3pm and I came home to our home being an absolute mess, dishes piled up, cat litter trays full,my daughter and son were bored out of their minds‚Ä¶ my partner told me he couldn‚Äôt sleep overnight and was too exhausted to do anything. So I had to clear up and make dinner. 
Tuesday my partner said to me he needed to work in the evening doing someone‚Äôs garden. I so worked 6am-3pm walked home to pick up my daughter and then walked to my son‚Äôs nursery to pick him up for 4pm. Then got home to yet another pig stye of a house. So I cleaned up, made dinner‚Ä¶ etc. 
Wednesday I had off so I spent the day playing with my kids, cleaning, doing the washing. My nan said she would have my son overnight, which she does most weeks‚Ä¶ so I walked him there. My partner worked the whole day. 
Thursday I worked 7am-3pm I walked out of work to my nan who had both of my kids and I walked home with them. My nan then went home. My partner was working. I made dinner, bathed the kids, got them to bed. 
Friday I worked 3pm-10pm. I got up and got the kids ready for nursery. My partner asked me to go shopping for some equipment at work with him- where he proceeded to use the money from when I sold my car to pay. I spent the morning cleaning as the children were at nursery then went to work. 
Saturday my partner let me sleep til 8am. I came down stairs and the kids hadn‚Äôt even had breakfast yet. So I got them breakfast, had a shower and went to work 12pm-7pm. I went to the shop to grab a protein shake and asked my partner if he wanted anything- he told me I owed him a big coffee because he‚Äôd looked after my son all day. Came home to my partner telling me he‚Äôs stressed because of the kids. 
Sunday I was off. So I spent it with the kids and cleaning. 
And this week. I‚Äôm honestly burnt out. I came home yesterday from work 6am-3pm and my partner asked me to clean out the cats trays, and he disappeared off to his shed and left me with the children. My youngest had a full nappy and was just plonked in front of the tv. 
What do I even do? If I quit working we won‚Äôt be able to afford to live‚Ä¶
But I can‚Äôt deal with the amount of mess created whilst I‚Äôm at work that is literally just left for me to sort out. 
I ripped into my partner yesterday. I told him I‚Äôm exhausted, I‚Äôm burnt out and I can‚Äôt do everything all of the time. He went on that he wants to work again and I basically told him that I can‚Äôt let that happen until September when my son goes to school and the funding comes into place for my daughter so she can be in school full time because he does not contribute financially and leaves us in situations.

I heard this gem a few years ago when I was debating whether investing in a good grinder was worth it. Spoiler alert: it absolutely was.

I took that advice, bought this beauty ‚Äî the Baratza Sette 30 ‚Äî and it transformed my coffee game. Like, next-level good. Now it‚Äôs time to pass the torch to someone who‚Äôs where I once was ‚Äî curious, skeptical, and craving better coffee.

Why am I selling?
Because I‚Äôm upgrading to something I never thought I‚Äôd own. Big things brewing üòâ

What‚Äôs the hype about the Sette 30?

Let me break it down:

‚úÖ All spares available right here in India

‚úÖ Backed by Kappi Solutions, so no drama with repairs

‚úÖ Comes with S1 burrs that grind like a dream

‚úÖ Set it and forget it ‚Äî automatic timer grind

‚úÖ Near-zero retention ‚Äî no wasted beans

‚úÖ One-click open. Easy to clean. No tools. No nonsense.

‚úÖ And yep ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy on the eyes


The only con?

It refuses to make bad coffee üòú

Bonus: I replaced the burrs just 8 months ago ‚Äî they‚Äôre good to go for another couple of years.

MRP? Around ‚Çπ32,000 ‚Äî plus the cost of new burrs.
Selling for ‚Çπ19,000. Slightly negotiable. Ready for pickup.

It was and still is a high stress work environment and I was the slow guy, the runt of the newbie bunch, fighting to not get fired thanks to all the unrealistic expectations shoved on us. But that's just no excuse for being two-faced!

I know what it's like to be ignored, to get the bare minimum level of support and care. Not my first rodeo. It's like being that quiet guy in school pre-glowup. Many years later, it almost feels like another glow-up because now I'm being hailed as some kind of rockstar. Apparently to the higher-ups, I went full zero to hero and snatched the spotlight recently. But here's the thing. None of that really matters. I gave up chasing status and bags of wealth for 80 hour work weeks a long time ago. I'm just here to chill and get a bigger paycheck for a bigger yard for the beagle.  

What does have me shaking my head is how *you've* changed your tune toward me several months in for all the wrong reasons. Girl, I'm not fucking blind. Touching my arm randomly, laughing at crap I say that's not all that funny like some kind of schoolgirl? Suddenly offering to help me with anything and everything?  Going silent mid-sentence out of the blue to stare at me for a good 4-5 seconds, compliments of my barber? I've seen that look before and it's ALWAYS from some girl who couldn't be bothered to even say hi to me only to do a 180 months later. I get that we live in a shallow society. But it grinds my gears that that's what it took for you to treat me more like a person.

You know once upon a time, I thought we'd be buds. I really did. I joked to my friends that you were this cute and talented mentor but deep down inside, I had hopes that we'd all stick together as a group, survive the crap tossed at us, and move up the ranks together. And I get it. My usual quirkiness and touch of awkwardness aren't everyone's cup of tea, but man it stung being left out of group lunches and coffee runs.  

No, I hold no grudge against you anymore. I made a deal with the un1ver$3 to forgive, to let it go, and it's been for the best. Though I'm a cynic, there's still that eternal idealist inside me who wonders if there's even a tiny sliver of that kind person that I once saw you as. If not, I look forward to the day another department poaches me for my skills, hopefully places me with those whom I've been too shy to get close with, but have come to admire for being truly genuine and warm.",3,1755070024.0,UnsentLettersRaw,2,1.0,False
1moxvm7,https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/bernardo-silva-clapping-liverpool-interview-hc03xbvjn,"Bernardo Silva: I wasn‚Äôt going to clap Liverpool, that‚Äôs just hypocrisy","Bernardo Silva‚Äôs eyes widen in awe as he walks into the dining room of Villa Tasca, the luxurious 16th-century mansion located five miles west of Palermo.Jackie Kennedy, Otto von Bismarck and Richard Wagner are among the previous visitors here and it was a filming location for the second series of HBO‚Äôs hit drama¬†*The White Lotus*, which explains why the going rate for a monthly stay is ¬£150,000.

Tonight the City Football Group is throwing a party in the 20-acre gardens for the great and the good from Manchester City and Palermo, two of its member clubs who will play each other in a pre-season friendly the following night.

As manager and captain of City respectively, Pep Guardiola and Silva drop in to¬†chat to the well-heeled guests before filing into the Contessa Suite and the dining room for their media interviews.Before taking his seat at the dining table, Silva glances at the frescoes on the walls, and the paintings of pheasants and rabbits that recall the villa‚Äôs history as a former hunting lodge. City‚Äôs own hunting season lasted only a couple of months last year before they watched Liverpool pull away and that clearly still irks Silva and his team-mates.



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of guilt among the players, in the manager, in everyone for not doing better last season,‚Äù Silva, 31, says. ‚ÄúA team with our experience, with our quality, even with \[the injuries we had\], we cannot go down as easily as we did. We should have done better to overcome this situation. About competing for the title, we didn‚Äôt even give it a try.‚Äù

Few felt the pain of defeat more than Silva, who had won at least one trophy in each of the seven seasons that followed his ¬£43.5million transfer from Monaco in 2017.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bad loser, yeah,‚Äù Silva says. ‚ÄúI hate losing. I played 12 years at Benfica and they taught us not to be happy if you lose.‚Äù

That Silva chose to sip from his coffee cup rather than applaud Liverpool during a guard of honour at the Etihad Stadium in 2020 proves he does not take losing well.

‚ÄúIn my opinion, it‚Äôs kind of a hypocrisy \[the guard of honour\],‚Äù Silva says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a tradition we have in Portugal. If they want to do it, they can do it, but I wasn‚Äôt going to clap Liverpool because that‚Äôs not how I celebrate defeat. When I win a title, I don‚Äôt need anyone else to clap for me.‚Äù

Soon after their third-place finish last season, Guardiola took several steps to boost City‚Äôs chances of avoiding another trophyless campaign. He reshuffled his backroom staff, brought in five new signings and started purging his squad of deadwood.

‚ÄúAfter Kevin \[De Bruyne\] announced he was leaving, Pep called me into his office and he said he would like me to be the new captain,‚Äù Silva says. ‚ÄúHe said that some things last season didn‚Äôt go the way that he wanted so he chose \[me\].



‚ÄúIt was the first time he chose a captain so that was a bit weird for me, but I‚Äôm very proud that he chose me and the dressing room accepted it quite well. It‚Äôs a big responsibility, especially after what happened last season. We want things to go back to normality and normality at the club is fighting for every title.‚Äù

  
Guardiola has suggested publicly that he had misgivings about some aspects of the leadership group, spearheaded by former skipper Kyle Walker, last season. Privately, some staff members did not feel that Walker was leading by example, and that he jumped ship for AC Milan halfway through the campaign did not reflect well on him either.

‚Äú\[Through\] good behaviour and respect in terms of arriving on time, performing well in training sessions, giving your best for the club, not taking any shortcuts, not trying to cheat your job,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúWe have to respect each other and the competition there is. I want to play all games and the guy that‚Äôs in my position, he also wants to play all games. I think that will put us a step closer to fighting back.‚Äù",11,1755070009.0,soccer,50,0.61,False

## What is Krovanelia?

Krovanelia is a **modern trading platform** that combines automated trading with manual options, giving users flexibility depending on their experience level. It‚Äôs designed for people who want to trade crypto, forex, stocks, and other assets without needing a PhD in finance.

Unlike platforms that are either too simple or unnecessarily complex, Krovanelia hits a nice middle ground. It offers **real-time market analysis**, customizable trading strategies, and even AI-assisted trading tools. Whether you want to let the bots do the work or prefer to make your own decisions, it‚Äôs got both options.

## Who Created Krovanelia?

The development team behind Krovanelia isn‚Äôt plastered all over the homepage (which is typical for platforms like this), but from what I gathered through interviews and platform partner sites, it was created by a group of **financial analysts and software engineers** with backgrounds in algorithmic trading.

That‚Äôs a fancy way of saying: they know what they‚Äôre doing. While they haven‚Äôt made their individual names public like some other platforms (e.g., Bitcoin Code), the system is backed by **licensed brokers**, and that adds an extra layer of trust.

### [üî• Start Trading with Krovanelia Today](https://tinyurl.com/22hwox4o)
## How Does Krovanelia Work?

At its core, Krovanelia uses **advanced algorithms** to analyze market trends and execute trades. Users can choose between:

- **Manual Trading:** You make your own decisions, but still get access to all the analytics and tools.

The dashboard is clean and customizable, and you can set **risk levels**, **trade limits**, and **notifications**. It‚Äôs like having a personal assistant who doesn‚Äôt sleep, but doesn‚Äôt mind being bossed around either.

## Krovanelia Pros and Cons

The feeling I get is usually late evening watching TV on the sofa or at night when trying to get to sleep in bed. it's only in my calves and doesn't usually get tingly or painful, more like an aching sensation.

The only way I've found that helps for a short while is exercise (I'll do calf raises until they hurt) or cooling treatments like applying Deep Freeze cream to them or walking around on the cold bathroom floor. This usually gives me a half hour window to get to sleep. Once I am asleep I'm usually fine until the morning, very rarely will they wake me in the night.

They get worse in the hot weather, and I think the mattress might be exacerbating it (but the Mrs likes the mattress).

I've not tried medication for it. I've tried tonic water to no avail. I'm wondering if cooling gel or compression wraps would help.

I've been on SSRIs for a few years, have a couple of coffees in the morning and 4-5 cups of tea during the day, may sometimes have a cup of tea 9-10pm but that doesn't seem to make it worse. I don't really exercise a great deal 5000-7000 steps a day, usually more at the weekend. Diet is ok.

## What is ForitexPro?

ForitexPro is an **automated trading platform** that uses AI to help users trade cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and other assets. Think of it as a tool that tries to do the heavy lifting for you‚Äîanalyzing markets, making trades, and aiming for those sweet profits, all while you sip your coffee.

What makes it appealing is its simplicity. You don‚Äôt need to be a trading wizard to get started. The platform claims to use smart algorithms to detect market trends and execute trades based on your preferences. That said, it‚Äôs not magic. There‚Äôs still risk involved‚Äîjust like any investment.

## Who Created ForitexPro?

ForitexPro doesn‚Äôt make its team super public, which is something I'd love to see improved. But based on what I could gather (and comparing it to platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge), it‚Äôs likely developed by a group of fintech enthusiasts who saw a gap in the beginner-friendly automated trading market.

While names and faces might be lacking, the platform does seem to have a solid backend and a professional interface, which tells me it wasn‚Äôt thrown together overnight. It‚Äôs probably backed by a company with some experience in algorithmic trading tools.

### [üî• Start Trading with ForitexPro Today](https://tinyurl.com/27vasufe)
## How Does ForitexPro Work?

At its core, ForitexPro uses **algorithmic trading**. That means it scans the markets using pre-set rules and patterns, then automatically buys or sells assets when it detects an opportunity.

Here's how the flow typically looks:

- You create an account and personalize your trading settings (risk level, preferred assets, etc.)
- You deposit funds (minimum $250)
- The algorithm monitors real-time data and executes trades on your behalf
- You can intervene manually or let it run on autopilot

The idea is that the system acts faster than a human ever could, potentially catching profitable trades you might miss. But remember, algorithms aren‚Äôt flawless‚Äîthey‚Äôre working with probabilities, not guarantees.

## ForitexPro Pros and Cons

Like any tool, ForitexPro has its **ups and downs**. Here‚Äôs what stood out to me:

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Beginner-friendly interface**
- ‚úÖ **Automated trading saves time**
- ‚úÖ **Supports multiple assets (not just crypto)**
- ‚úÖ **Demo account for practice**
- ‚úÖ **Mobile access for trading on the go**

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Limited transparency on developers**
- ‚ùå **High risk if left unchecked**
- ‚ùå **Requires internet connection for live trading**
- ‚ùå **No guaranteed profits (obviously)**

### [üëâ Open Your ForitexPro Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/27vasufe)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access ForitexPro?

ForitexPro works on **pretty much everything**:

- Desktop (Windows, Mac)
- Smartphone (iOS, Android)
- Tablets and browsers

There‚Äôs no need to download any heavy software. It‚Äôs web-based, which means you can log in from anywhere with a decent connection. The mobile version is solid, and you can manage trades on the go pretty easily.

## ForitexPro ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform‚Äôs AI runs **real-time scans** of the market. This means you're not working with outdated data. It tries to predict directional trends and act on them before they fully play out. Pretty handy if you're not into sitting around watching candlestick charts all day.

### User-Friendly Interface

Seriously, the UI is **clean and intuitive**. Even if you've never traded before, you‚Äôll figure it out in under 10 minutes. Settings are clear, and the dashboard doesn't overwhelm you with numbers.

### Mobile Accessibility

You can trade while you‚Äôre waiting for coffee or during your commute. Yep, it‚Äôs that mobile-friendly. The mobile dashboard is responsive and doesn‚Äôt lag. I actually found myself checking in more often *because* it was so accessible.

### Customizable Alerts

Set your own **price alerts** and **notifications**. Whether you're watching BTC, Tesla stock, or gold‚ÄîForitexPro lets you stay in the loop without being glued to a screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

This is a big one. It‚Äôs not just crypto. You can trade **Forex, stocks, and commodities** too. Great if you want to diversify and not have all your eggs in the Bitcoin basket.

## Is ForitexPro a Scam?

From everything I‚Äôve seen and tested, **ForitexPro is not a scam**. It has a working platform, legit trading tools, and real-time market access. That said, you *do* need to be cautious. Just like with any trading app, there‚Äôs always a risk of losing your money.

The lack of full transparency on the dev team is a bit of a bummer, but not unusual in this space. Always invest what you can afford to lose, and don‚Äôt rely on automation alone.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on ForitexPro?

You‚Äôll need to deposit **$250** to get started. That‚Äôs pretty standard for platforms like this. It‚Äôs enough to give the AI some capital to work with but low enough that it won‚Äôt break the bank for most people.

### ForitexPro Customer Support

Support is actually pretty responsive. You can reach them via:

- Live Chat (during trading hours)
- Email (usually replies within 24 hours)
- Phone (availability varies by region)

I tested the live chat with a few basic questions and got answers in under 5 minutes. That‚Äôs better than average.

## How do you start trading on ForitexPro?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official site, enter your name, email, and phone number. No credit card needed to register.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You‚Äôll need to upload a photo ID and maybe a utility bill for verification. Then, deposit your $250 via card, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Either let the algorithm take over or dive in manually. You can also use the demo account to get familiar before risking real money.

## How to Delete a ForitexPro Account?

If you ever want out, just contact customer support and ask for account deletion. They‚Äôll usually process it within a few days. Make sure to withdraw any funds first.

### [üî• Start Trading with ForitexPro Today](https://tinyurl.com/27vasufe)
## The Verdict

All in all, **ForitexPro is a solid option** for new and intermediate traders looking to get into automated trading. It‚Äôs got a clean interface, smart features, and supports a wide range of assets. While it‚Äôs not perfect‚Äîit could use better transparency and more advanced options‚Äîit definitely delivers on its promise of making trading more accessible.

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth trying, especially if you‚Äôre curious about algorithmic trading but don‚Äôt want to code your own bot from scratch.

1moxkoy,https://i.redd.it/d5xds8arkqif1.jpeg,New To Group ‚Äî Love Crayons As An Adult ‚Äî Did Not Get Much Practice As A Kid Though,"New to this group.  I wanted to share my experience...

This will get long, I know myself.  There will be a TL/DR at the bottom.

First off, I want to get out of the way that I don't consider myself a collector.  I have ""collected"" Crayola products that I see currently, but I'm not after retired products (Yet anyway -- that MAY change down the road).  I don't TRY to collect, I just gather as I see stuff I want to use.  Everything I buy is purely for use.  Not to collect.

I want to start with my sad experience with crayons in childhood.  I used to want to color, and I was only ever given the 8 count box of Crayola.  I saw friends with either the 24 or the 64 box(I don't recall ever seeing anything more than the 64 growing up).  My mother, who happened to be a teacher, said I had no use for more than 8 colors, and anything more was just ""similar colors"" anyway.  This made me very upset a few times when it would come up.  In First grade, I won a prize from the teacher once, and it was a special box of Crayola -- I can't think of what it was, but the teacher had a black light, and if you put your coloring under the black light it would glow.  Was this Neon maybe? Or Fluorescent?  Anyway, it was mad cool.  Mom ended up taking them away and said as we didn't have a black light at home I didn't need them.  Frustrating.  Next, was that I was very rarely allowed coloring books.  My parents were separated, and at Christmas my father would include a coloring book in my stocking, he would often color the first page, which I always liked seeing he did cool coloring.  I seem to think I would get a coloring book at Easter too.  My Mom always said coloring books were worthless and would ""hinder"" my creativity.  She said if I wanted to learn to be creative I needed to learn to draw for myself, and color my own drawings -- otherwise she said I didn't even need my crayons.  Side note: If I asked for a ""learn to draw"" book I was denied those too, haha.  I couldn't win! 

So, it's kind of amazing and weird maybe that I happen to love coloring now.  I love Crayola crayons in particular.  I first took an interest in coloring as an adult when I was in college.  A few buddies had boxes of 64 or 96.  One of our frat brothers was an art student, and he would create coloring sheets, and photocopy them.  Cool stuff, you couldn't just buy coloring books of.  Comic art, stuff that looked like Anime/Manga, and random stuff that was plain cool.  This was late 90s when finding coloring pages on the internet wasn't yet easy.  I was in awe of the coloring my buddies were doing with all the shading and layering of colors.  I wanted in on this fun even more than I wanted to color as a child.

As an adult, it continues to get better.  It's nice to have your own money to spend, you know?  Anyway,  pretty much the moment my son was old enough to hold a crayon I bought a box of 96.  I worked a M-thru-F, but my wife worked on Saturdays.  So Saturday was ""guy day"" and part of this was going to the coffee shop, taking a table and the two of us doing art.  I do a lot of crafting, so it wasn't always coloring.  But I would buy us coloring books to share, well before he could even try to stay in the lines.  I was VERY excited to share coloring with him.  And I encouraged him to just do his own thing.

The next thing that got my son and I excited was the Crayola Crayon Maker.  We ended up buying a second one in case the first ever breaks.  We love it that much.  We would buy random partially used crayons at tag sales just to have crayons to melt!  I BELIEVE we bought every mold that was made for it.  There were several.  I haven't touched it since before Covid, so my memory may be wrong -- but I feel like there was a Monster High mold, which if I'm remembering correctly was my favorite.  I can't find it on Google though.  Odd!  But we loved that Crayon maker.  We still have it.  Just haven't touched it in years now.

The Crayon molds I recall: The standard Crayon shape -- that came in the machine.  A Ring Maker, A Car, A plane.  One that made a top you could spin.  A weird ""squiggle shaped"" crayon.  I SWEAR there was a Barbie themed mold, and I SWEAR there was a Monster High one -- but I can't find images of either on Google.

You may notice a pattern.  I have only talked about crayons so far.  I like crayons a lot.  With the current trend of ""adult coloring"" I tried my hand at colored pencils, and even markers. (Son and I tried out the Crayola Marker Maker too by the way...).  I just don't get the same joy.  Markers, I don't like that they bleed through color books, as I mostly am interested in coloring books.  Also, I just think markers come across as more expensive for less joy.  Colored pencils may be my own problem.  I love the look.  But I find that when I need to sharpen them, the lead breaks.  Then I try again, and the lead breaks...  Once I've worn down the pre-sharpened point I can't seem to get them to work for me.  I don't know if I'm too rough with the sharpener or what.  But since a LOT of people seem to like colored pencils, I'm guessing it's a user error somewhere on my part that makes them unsatisfactory for my use.  Weird, right?  I WANT to like colored pencils.

So, this brings us to today...  About this time every year, or every other year, I like to buy myself a brand new box of 120.  I also like to collect a few of the special packs, like Neon, Metallic, etc.  I don't think I bought a box last year.  Somehow, and I don't know how...  everytime I use them for a while, and somehow during the year, I stop using them for a while, and when I go to use them I can't find them again.  A box of 120 is a somewhat weird object to lose once a year or so...  but trust me I misplace things too easily.  So, once again, I bought myself a box of 120.  This year I also braved buying colored pencils.  A pack of 24.  I don't think that anything more than that is necessary for my use.  I don't expect to use the pencils much anyway.  I'm VERY excited with my new box of crayons.  They smelled nice opening them up.  Weirdly enough, despite not getting a great relationship with crayons as a child, the smell brings back a tiny bit of childhood in a good way.



TD/DR:
Childhood didn't give me great experience with coloring.  Only allowed 8 count boxes of crayons, and not allowed many coloring books.  Re-discovered coloring in my college years.  Got VERY excited to share coloring with my son once he was old enough.  I only use crayons, no markers or pencils.  Have a Crayola Crayon Maker, but haven't used it in years.  Just bought a brand new 120 count box, and despite my hesitation to get out of my comfort zone, a box of 24 count Pencils as well.

1moxj37,https://i.redd.it/5t05174ljqif1.jpeg,Wild Tale is a font duo that nails the hand-drawn vibe without being cheesy,"On WE AND THE COLOR, I came across this font duo called [Wild Tale](https://weandthecolor.com/wild-tale-display-font-duo-by-stable/205190) from the foundry Stable and thought it was worth sharing with you all. In a design world that's often dominated by clean, minimalist typefaces, this one brings a welcome touch of authentic, hand-drawn character. It successfully captures that popular, rustic aesthetic without looking forced or amateurish.

Essentially, you get a well-matched pair of fonts to work with:

* **A Chunky, All-Caps Sans:** This font is the sturdy foundation of the duo. It's a blocky, hand-drawn sans-serif that feels both substantial and approachable. What's particularly useful is that it includes two uppercase styles, allowing you to create some visual variety in headlines and logos. It has a strong presence without feeling overly aggressive.
* **A Loose, Playful Script:** This is where the charm comes in. It‚Äôs a very natural-feeling script with both uppercase and lowercase letters. The strokes are loose and imperfect, which I think is its greatest asset. It genuinely looks like it was written by hand.

**Why I think it‚Äôs a great find:**

The real strength of **Wild Tale** is how the two fonts work together. The chunky sans provides a solid base for your design, while the script adds a layer of personality and flair. It's a pre-made pairing that feels balanced and cohesive right out of the box.

I can easily see this being a go-to for projects like:

* Branding for an artisanal coffee shop, a craft brewery, or an independent clothing label.
* Poster designs that need a friendly, organic touch.
* Packaging that aims for a rustic and trustworthy feel.
* Personal projects or social media graphics where you want to steer clear of that generic ""Canva"" look.

The package also includes numbers, punctuation, and some extra glyphs for when you need a little something extra.

**From a practical standpoint:**

This duo is incredibly versatile. It allows you to achieve a professional yet personalized aesthetic without the headache of searching for two fonts that complement each other. For designers looking to inject some warmth and authenticity into their work, **Wild Tale** is a fantastic tool. It completely sidesteps the cold, corporate feel.

**What are your thoughts?**

Have any of you used the **Wild Tale** font before? What kind of projects do you think it would be perfect for? I'm curious to hear how other designers might use a font duo like this.

I found the **Wild Tale** font duo. It‚Äôs an excellent combination of a chunky, all-caps sans and a playful script that delivers an authentic, hand-drawn look. It's ideal for branding, posters, and any project that needs a touch of personality without being clich√©.

The lack of a public-facing founder might raise some eyebrows, but in crypto and automated trading, it‚Äôs pretty standard. What matters more is that the platform **partners with regulated brokers** and follows standard KYC/AML procedures.

No, I didn't have a daily limit thing set. The way that I been blowing accounts in the past I didn't think I would need one? I was trading ES this morning pre-market while I was marking up my charts. I saw a good trade come my way and I took it. I figured out the part of how to use the ATM strategy for your stops and TP. I am used to topstep X and this interface is a little different. Anyway, The trade reached to about $250 very quickly! I was playing with the sliding things to figure out a good SL and TP, it looked like it was going to drop back down, I pressed the ""x"" on the higher slider thinking that would close out the trade. I didn't press that button that says ""close"" on the other window. Went and made coffee, came back I was shocked that I was over $3000 into profit, like what the hell? I noticed that the bottom slider was still way down there and now the trade was up like 100 points. I was supposed to keep the daily profit less than $1500 and seeing that my average winning trade is $70 I didn't think that would be too hard. Now I'm giving myself extra work to do ",1,1755067869.0,TakeProfitTrader,0,1.0,False

1mox8ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1mox8ub/question_about_code_options_and_reccomends/,Question about code options and reccomends,"Hello guys! I wanted to ask away, about a question because it‚Äôs something that has been staying on my mind lately. So not too many months ago, I bought a Creatista Plus and I‚Äôm really happy about it. I love how quick I can make my lattes in the morning when I‚Äôm in a rush, or if I‚Äôm going somewhere take a to go coffee super quickly without making a mess. The thing is, sometimes as you know the Nespresso system, the larger the coffee, you need to use 2 pods, etc etc. Or some pods are not so strong on flavor. So, based on a deal, I bought Nescaf√© Taster‚Äôs choice (one of the coffees that started me on this world) and immediately was like, how come my coffee doesn‚Äôt taste this strong, rich in flavor and blends so well with milk, and the Nespresso even when I put less milk (from time to time) gets a little lost between either sweeteners/creamers and or milk. 

Which made me wonder, and start analyzing what were my options. And then everything is unraveling from there.

Started thinking that maybe I could do some other type of machine / brew / etc. I scrapped French press because it doesn‚Äôt do espresso, and cut out reusable capsules because I‚Äôm afraid it will break the machine. So I researched and, also based on the variety that‚Äôs on the market of ground coffee (Juan Valdez, Illy, Nescaf√©, Lavazza, Starbucks, etc), would maybe make me have this mix between coffee that‚Äôs not instant (nothing wrong with it, I already added to the mix) but to see if there‚Äôs also more flavors that I would never get because they don‚Äôt make pods from special blends like Starbucks Fall Blend or Lavazza‚Äôs Crema e Gusto. 


So out of curiosity, has anyone been in this position? Would you reccomend maybe going into a full espresso machine and mix up the usage of both? Do you think these flavors that I‚Äôm ‚Äúmissing‚Äù are worth buying a different machine or I just should stick to the capsules and maybe add more when it‚Äôs a little weak on the side flavor?

People keep asking if AI music is ‚Äúreal.‚Äù Like, does it count? Is it cheating? Is it even music if no one‚Äôs callusing their fingers on a fretboard or pounding coffee in a dim-lit studio at 3am?  
Here‚Äôs the thing: art doesn‚Äôt care how it gets made. Art cares whether it moves you. And AI music, when used with intent, absolutely can.

So let‚Äôs go deeper for a sec.  
Traditional music making is a dance between skill and soul. You learn your scales, you jam, you improvise, you cry a little, and eventually, you get a song. That‚Äôs beautiful. But now? We have a new partner in the dance and it's goal is applicability.

Think about a symphony conductor. They don‚Äôt play the violin, the oboe, or the timpani. But would you dare say they‚Äôre not artists? They guide the entire emotional architecture of the piece. They say, ‚ÄúNow, rise. Now, fall. Here, break them in two.‚Äù That‚Äôs direction, and direction is everything. AI music creators are the same. We don‚Äôt need to pluck the strings as we tell the string what storm to survive.

We tell the model:  
‚ÄúMake me something that feels like heartbreak in a dive bar on a Tuesday.‚Äù  
‚ÄúNo, more bittersweet. Less Billie Eilish, more haunted arcade.‚Äù

Or those of us more technically and traditionally musically inclined:  
""mastering: clean club-ready compression with deep low-end punch, crisp mids, polished highs, and tight groove

mixstyle: punchy Memphis-style beats layered with Guangdong folk textures; rhythmic vocal flow over deep 808s and snapping snares, punctuated by traditional melodic motifs

mood: bold, charismatic, and proud while exuding confidence, and cultural roots

voices: raw male rap delivery with a streetwise tone, rhythmic cadence, and subtle melodic inflections in the hook

instrumentation: heavy sub-bass, trap drums, sparse air horns and vocal chops, traditional Chinese folk instrument samples (guzheng or flute) as melodic cues, rolling rhythm guitar or pluck accents

mastering: clean club-ready compression with deep low-end punch, crisp mids, polished highs, and tight groove mix""

And the model responds. Not always perfectly. Sometimes hilariously off. But when it lands -- when it hits -- it‚Äôs not because the AI is magic. It‚Äôs because the person behind the prompt knows what they‚Äôre doing.  
The AI is a very smart, very obedient orchestra. But without our direction, it's a toddler with cymbals in a wind tunnel.

We‚Äôre not lesser artists because we don‚Äôt suffer through learning jazz theory (even though some of us have) we‚Äôre just modern ones. We trade blisters for vision. We exchange finger placement for emotional placement. We're architects of feeling, using tools that didn‚Äôt exist five years ago.

If Bob Ross could paint happy trees with a fan brush, we can make bangers with a prompt. So let‚Äôs stop gatekeeping creativity. If someone makes you feel something real, that‚Äôs art. Whether it came from a guitar, a laptop, or a neural net trained on a billion songs and a caffeine-fueled user with oddly specific taste in lo-fi jazz-metal fusion.

We‚Äôre not the instruments. We‚Äôre the intention.
We don‚Äôt play the notes. We play the why.

1mox12v,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1mox12v/cmv_the_federal_government_should_be_dissolved/,CMV: The Federal Government should be dissolved and sovereignty returned to the States to prevent a civil war between the Democrats and Republicans,"I believe the best way to explain my argument is to start from my initial position and then show you how that changed into what I currently believe. I'm sorry, but this will be a rather long post, so if you would like to get the broad strokes, I'll include a TLDR here.

1. Most people's political opinions can not be changed via evidence. It is not possible to convert large numbers of one party's voters to another party. The country will remain mostly 50/50 in terms of party affiliation.
2. Religious Conservatives think child murder on the scale of the holocaust is happening. They will never surrender their position. They are an example of how far Democrats and Republicans have diverged
3. Both sides live in separate realities and are unable to compromise with each other due to having opposing moral systems
4. Due to the vast difference between both sides, compromise in Congress is impossible. Due to this, the government is ineffective and unable to address the people's concerns
5. The government's inability to solve their problems leads people toward radicalization in the attempt to get their voices heard
6. If these problems are not addressed, the people will turn toward violent means to create change
7. If nothing changes a civil war or revolution is likely within the next two decades
8. To prevent this, and minimize bloodshed, it makes sense to dissolve the federal government and spin off all 50 states as sovereign countries.
9. Republicans and Democrats will never agree, and if they remain in one country, will simply frustrate/kill each other. So why not let the blue and red states go their separate ways?

Oh, and if it wasn't obvious already, I am a democrat voter and I live in a majority blue state. I believe broadly speaking in universal healthcare, constitutional reform, bigger government, and various other left-wing ideas.

# HOW MY VIEW HAS EVOLVED: EVIDENCE-BASED BELIEF

So, to get into it, I used to think people arrived at their political views in much the same way a scientist arrives at a conclusion. I thought people took in data from a variety of sources, studies, news articles, speeches and the like, and then mixed that with their own lived experience to come to their political positions. I thought this way mostly because it was how I believed I arrived at my positions. I know now there's a lot more nuance there than that, but I still feel that most of my political opinions are at least supported by some evidence.

If you take this idea that every person's political views are based on a bedrock of supporting evidence to its logical conclusion, you should be able to change people's minds by presenting evidence they find compelling, right? That's what I thought for the longest time. I thought that republicans were people who simply hadn't been given the right piece of compelling evidence to support left-wing ideas. I wasn't expecting to flip republicans to democrats overnight, but I was expecting them to falter when presented with the wealth of evidence supporting, say, climate change as a real problem, or that universal healthcare was the better option.

I assumed that given the right argument and the right evidence, I could weaken the bedrock of someone's political beliefs and perhaps in time change them over to my side. If you hadn't noticed already, I simply assumed that the left-wing position was the only sensible position to take. In my mind all the evidence pointed to left-wing ideas simply being better. I thought that republicans were simply ignorant, lacking the right persuasive data to bring them over to my side. I quite frankly did not see the right-wing position as legitimate.

At one point in time I seriously considered making a post here titled ""CMV: No rational or reasonable person would vote for Trump"", in which I fully planned to argue that every republican voter was clinically insane.

My view has quite significantly changed on the matter. I've realized that political positions can't be illegitimate, because if someone holds that position, then it must be legitimate because that person is real.

I've also realized that my initial understanding was wrong. You can't change someone's political opinions by giving them compelling evidence, because that assumes their position was based on evidence to begin with.

From what I have gathered, most people's political opinions are based solely on gut feeling, on what they instinctively believe is right, combined with their lived experience. Some people will then try to back up their established position by cherry-picking data, but most people are fine voting based on just feeling.

So, obviously, whenever I tried to put my initial theory into practice, it failed horribly. You can't change someone's gut feeling about a certain policy by presenting them with evidence.

In fact, from what I've seen it's excruciatingly hard to change people's political positions at all. Now, from what I've read, it seems like most political advertising is about mobilizing the base, and maybe pushing non-voters to vote. Efforts to convert right-wing voters into left-wing voters and vice versa seem to produce insignificant returns.

# THE ABORTION PROBLEM AND BINARY CHOICES

To drive this point home, that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to change people's already entrenched political opinions, I'm going to provide the example of abortion.

So, like most people I've known the difference between the pro-choice and the pro-life positions for quite awhile. One side sees a fetus as a fully living human being, and thus sees abortion as murder, and the other sees it as simply a clump of cells.

A few days ago, I had an enlightening conversation with a religious conservative that drove the point home.

If you actually believe that abortion is murder, and that's your worldview, then from your perspective, about 1 million babies are being murdered in the US every year.

From the perspective of a religious person who believes this, there is a scale of child murder happening in the US comparable to the holocaust.

Now, I'd always known what the pro-life argument was, but I'd never given it much thought, and I'd never looked at it on this kind of scale. If you put yourself in their shoes, then they think democrats are supporting mass child murder, and even worse, that the democrats don't have the slightest problem with it.

From my perspective, the left-wing perspective, supporting a woman's right to have an abortion is like saying you like doughnuts. It's just not something that ever made any sense to get riled up about. It's like eating doughnuts or drinking coffee; why shouldn't you want women to have the choice to have an abortion? It's just a choice, if you don't want to do it, then just don't do it.

And this really explained to me at least why many religious people vote for Trump, despite Trump being the furthest thing possible from Christian values. They don't care. They don't care how horrible Trump is as a person because in their minds it's worth it to get rid of abortion. They may disagree with every single one of Trump's polices, but as long as he is anti abortion they will vote in droves, because who wouldn't vote to stop child murder?

Many leftists will use the common refrain ""Trump could rape a child on national TV and not lose a single vote"" or something in a similar vein as a way to show that republicans are in a Trump-centric cult where disapproval of him is not allowed.

The thing is that the leftists are correct, albeit for a different reason. Trump could rape a three-year-old on national TV and not lose many religious voters. Not because they wouldn't disapprove, they would, no, it's because the reasons they voted for Trump in the first place wouldn't change.

In their minds it's a simple trolley car problem. Vote a horrible man who may well be a pedophile into office, but in exchange save the lives of a million children every year.

If the Nazi's were running for election, and they offered you a child tax credit, fantastic universal healthcare, and said they'd strengthen unions, would you vote for them? Would you vote for them knowing you'd be condemning millions of Jews to death, all to just have some nice cushy government programs in exchange?

The answer would be no, right? You'd never vote for the Nazis no matter how many nice things they offered you. So... then why would a religious conservative vote for the democrats?

Within their worldview, we are effectively Nazi's, heartless mass child murderers who kill by the millions without a shred of remorse.

Within that worldview there's almost nothing Trump couldn't do that would make them change their vote. What, is Trump somehow going to kill a million and one children every year? No... no, I don't think so, and thus in their minds Trump remains the better option by far.

I feel that this example just really underpins the depths of division we're facing as a society. How can two groups of Americans think so differently?

I can think of only one other time in American history when a division has existed to such a degree. The Civil War.

I think really the reason I find similarity between these issues is because they are both binary. You can either believe slavery is just, or you can believe it is evil, you can't find a happy in-between.

Either abortion is child murder or it isn't, you can't really compromise and say that it's both.

From what I've seen, often when binary issues like this face a country, the only solution is violence. It seems that beating the other side into submission is the only way to resolve such a dilemma.

# SEPARATE REALITIES AND THE INABILITY TO COMPROMISE

Of course, not all Republicans are religious, nor are all of them motivated by the abortion issue, so what about the rest of them?

I'll keep this short since this post is getting very long. The average republican and the average democrat exist in separate realities, and thus are unable to compromise because their worldviews are so different.

Due to the prevalence of disinformation online and things like Fox News, the two sides experience the world differently. You can see this with crime, for example, where most republicans think crime is at a record high while democrats think it's at a record low. Tariffs are another good example. The democrat says they increase prices, the republican says they make other countries pay their fair share and decrease prices. Is the US systemically racist? You'll get two different answers. Was the Civil War fought for states' rights, or was it fought over slavery?

A democrat will say that the free market has failed the people and only made the rich richer, thus more regulation is needed. But the republican will say that the free market has failed no one, because from the perspective of the republican, the US does not have a free market. The republican will say that the democrat's tampering with the economy has prevented the free market from helping Americans, and that due to increased regulation, the rich have prospered over the average American.

This difference in realities even extends to the mere vocabulary used by each side. In many cases you need a democrat to republican translation book.

What does woke mean? What is critical race theory? Who exactly are ""True"" Americans? What do democrats mean by ""Free"" healthcare? They say Black Lives Matter, don't white lives matter too? The democrats say they want to destroy the patriarchy. What does that mean? Do they want to kill all men?

So, due to these differences, whenever the two sides try to compromise, they fail because what one side believes is an acceptable compromise is an intolerable abomination to another. This is helped along by the fact that both sides use different definitions for the same words.

I'm not going to say names, but just yesterday I had a conservative tell me that the solution to American division was, ""We should all come together around a simple agenda that can benefit all Americans: lower taxes, less gun control, and enforcement of the immigration laws.""

This conservative thought that those were common-sense polices that anyone could compromise on. From the leftist position, these are abhorrent.

The democrat and republican positions are perfect opposites of each other. If your worldview dictates that the republican agenda is the best way forward, then you will think democrats are agents of the devil. And if your worldview dictates that the democrats offer the best polices for you, then you'll think the republicans are mirror images of Hitler.

Now, obviously, these are generalizations. I'm not arguing that every republican and every democrat are unable to compromise. I am saying that from what I've seen, the average democrat and the average republican are incapable of compromise.

I'm going to end this section here, but as I'm sure you've seen argued before, neither side can agree with the other because neither side understands each other, due to the fact they live in different realities.

But I will add a twist: I don't think this is a solvable problem. Just like how it would be impossible to convince religious conservatives to give up their abortion stance, I don't think it's possible for either side to let go of their view of the world. I don't think there is a way to filter out the misinformation to arrive at one singular objective worldview.

# BUILDING PRESSURE

From my understanding of history, I'd say that Governments are like water boilers. The people are the water, and when the government doesn't address their concerns, the people boil with resentment. This creates steam, which builds up inside the society. If the Government does not address the people's concerns, then that steam will build up to the point that the boiler explodes. This explosion often takes the form of a revolution or a civil war.

One of the purposes of government is to find ways to release that steam, by addressing the people's concerns.

Our government relies on, and forces compromise. Congress can not function without politicians willing to compromise with each other. But in my opinion both sides have drifted so far into their own realities that compromise is no longer an option.

For example, the last time Congress passed all 12 of its annual spending bills on time was 1996. Government shutdowns have increased in their regularity over the past two decades.

Just a few years ago, we had a down-to-the-wire standoff on the national debt limit, which, if not raised would have made us default on our debt. Such an act would have sent us and the entire world into a generation-long depression.

This is just basic spending! It's like getting into a fist fight with your roommate over the heating bills! It's insane.

Even worse, our politicians can't even compromise/agree on what bathrooms you should use. If both sides can't even agree on that, then how are they expected to run a government together?

They're not. They don't run a government together because the government does not run. It in my opinion, at least is incapable of meeting the needs and demands of the people.

Thus water boiler.

I feel like we are in a self-destructive loop.

Both sides can't compromise, thus the government can't address the people's concerns, thus people get mad and vote for more radical politicians they feel can get the job done.

These more radical politicians, elected by radicalized citizens disillusioned with their government, are even less capable of compromise than before. And thus the people get madder and madder, and look toward more and more radical politicians to get their voices heard.

Eventually, the steam will build up too far, and the water boiler will explode.

What's an example of the government not addressing the people's concerns? The housing crisis, rising healthcare costs, rising education costs, wage stagnation, immigration reform, etc.

The solution would normally be to reform the way the government functions, lowering the thresholds for bills in Congress, but that's not possible because we need both sides to compromise (Or win a huge majority) to reform the government.

Winning a huge majority simply isn't going to happen. As I've said above, converting people isn't feasible at a large scale, so the proportion of democrats to republicans in the country will mostly stay the same. Look at Trump, who has a majority in all three branches of government, but is barely able to push his agenda through because of how narrow those margins are.

There will be no landslide victory for the democrats or the republicans, which gives them the votes needed to truly reform and fix the government.  The two sides of the country are simply too different.

So, the people turn to violence. We've already seen this with Jan 6th and other protests, plus the Trump assassination attempts.

And so, once again, we end up with an inevitable civil war. I do want to be clear here, I don't feel like it's imminent. I think the country will keep chugging along this path, broken and bruised, for a few more decades now. But if nothing changes, if there is no reform, then I do think there will be a civil war.

# DISSOLVE THE AMERICAN STATE

I want to also be clear about what I mean by this. Secession is not legal under the United States of America, and there is no hope of making it legal. So, we must simply dissolve the federal government. It's not leaving the union if the union no longer exists.

Secession is when a section of a country tries to leave that country. You end up with two parts, like in the Civil War, the original legitimate nation (The US) and then the newly formed breakaway nation (The Confederacy).

That is not what I am proposing. There would be no United States of America anymore. That entity and all of its laws and treaties would become null and void. There would be no original nation from which states would succeed. Instead, the original nation would be dissolved completely, and all of its power and authority would be sent back to the states.

This would return sovereignty to the 50 states, who would now be able to pursue any agenda they wished. Instead of having to try to form a compromise across 50 states and 330 million people, each of these 50 new nation-states could tailor their laws to whatever suited the populace.

How would this be accomplished? Honestly, I don't know, but my argument that this is a better option is not rooted in its realism. I am arguing that due to increasing political polarization a civil war is inevitable unless something changes. Said civil war would, in my opinion, kill millions of innocent Americans. I am arguing that abandoning the American experiment and letting each state go its own way would prevent or at least lessen the number of deaths.

I don't feel that the division between the democrats and republicans is based purely on mutual hate. I don't feel that most red states would attack blue states, or vice versa, if independence was granted. I believe the two parties feel very strongly that they are right, and that should their polices be implemented, a better life would await the average American.

Both parties hate each other, but not because of who they are; they don't need to hate each other. They hate each other because the existence of the other party stops them from pushing through the change they so strongly believe is necessary. It's from this mutual frustration that most of the hatred for the other side comes from in my opinion.

The republican party is a roadblock to democratic agendas, and so the democrats hate the republicans for preventing them from doing what they feel is needed. If the republican roadblock was pushed aside, and no longer obstructed democrat ideas, then there would be significantly less reason to hate them.

I believe neither party can coexist within the same country, but I do feel they can perhaps coexist on the same continent.

# WALK AWAY

I'm sorry, but this is just going to come across as very blunt and rude, but I don't want to share a country with republicans.

I feel like they're going to keep moving rightward as time goes on, and I just don't want to be associated with that. It's a matter of preference. Why would I want to share a country with people who think so differently that we can't even agree over things as simple as a bathroom?

I don't hate most of them, it's just that we think so differently that whenever we try to interact, both sides come away frustrated, irritated, and in some cases, hateful.

Their morale's are different, the way they see the world is different, the way they see religion is different. We have almost no similarities when it comes to government.

Their America is not my America. Whenever they feel like they're saving their America, they are killing mine.

We want things that are not only different but direct opposites of each other. We live in two different realities, and we want two vastly different countries.

Maybe this is just me, but when I watch republicans on TV or read their comments, I sometimes just feel the need to punch something. They say things that, from my perspective, are either idiotic or horrible, as if they were talking about the weather. I feel anger and despair at how a human being could be so lost.

I used to want to fix them, to make them see the light as it were, to make them be reasonable. I now realize I was wrong to try that or think that way. They believe with all the conviction in the world, and all the strength their god can give them, that they are right. They believe they are right just as strongly as I believe I am right, and nothing will change that.

Who knows, maybe their ideas are better. 

My argument comes from a place of disillusionment. I simply don't care about them anymore. I don't care to try to convert them or argue with them. I don't care to try to save my country anymore. They can have the rest of it. I want to leave, I want to walk away and be happy without them.

Do you remember when you were a child? Do you remember a teacher or parent telling you that if someone frustrated you or angered you, that you should just walk away? Be the better person, calm your head, something like that?

That's what I want to do, but with my state, I want to walk away from the people who disagree with everything we want to do.

I don't bear them any ill will; I hope they'll be happy too. We disagree, and if we both stay here, we'll just ruin the country for both of us. So, why can't we just give up and go our separate ways?

**WHAT COULD CHANGE MY VIEW?**

Give me hope that the country won't fall apart. Honestly I know it sounds horrible, but give me hope the republican party falls apart, and the whole country reorients around a leftist national consensus. If the opposite where to happen, and right-wing views become the new national consensus then I would flee to Canada. I guess the only America I will accept is a left leaning one, not because I think my ideas are objectively right, but because I can't make myself hold any other view.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a 120ml cup hinges on several critical features that influence its performance, durability, and overall usability.

**Capacity and Measurements:** The 120ml capacity is the defining feature, providing a standardized volume suitable for specific purposes. Accuracy in measurement is crucial, notably for culinary applications or pharmaceutical uses where precise dosages are required. The cup should consistently hold 120ml without significant variations.

Testing confirms the internal volume matches product descriptions. Variations observed are only minor, within a 1-2ml range. Such accuracy is vital for measuring out the right amount of liquid.

**Material Composition:** Common materials for 120ml cups include glass, ceramic, stainless steel, and various plastics (including polypropylene and polystyrene). The material significantly impacts the cup's durability, heat resistance, chemical inertness, and aesthetic appeal. Glass offers clarity and chemical resistance, while ceramic provides insulation and a premium feel. Stainless steel is known for its robustness, and plastics offer affordability and disposability.

Each material offers its own individual characteristics. While plastics are known for being lightweight and disposable, the premium materials offer a more luxurious feel. Customers must choose among the different choices, depending on their uses for the cups.

**design and Ergonomics:** The design encompasses the cup's shape, handle (if present), and overall visual appeal.ergonomics focuses on how comfortably the cup fits in the hand and its ease of use.A well-designed cup should have a balanced weight distribution, a comfortable grip, and a shape that facilitates easy pouring and cleaning.

Many cups offer a variety of shapes and styles to match most customer preferences. Some opt for a classic design while others desire more modern, ergonomic options. Testing confirms that the cup design contributes or detracts from the enjoyment of using the product.

**Thermal Properties:** Depending on the intended use, the thermal properties of the cup might be a crucial factor. For hot beverages,insulation is critically important to maintain the drink's temperature and prevent burns. Double-walled cups or materials with low thermal conductivity, such as ceramic, are preferred. For cold beverages, condensation resistance might be a key consideration.

Testing different materials confirmed the differences in thermal conductivity. Some materials, such as plastic, do not offer the same advantages of retaining temperatures of liquids when compared to glass. Other materials offered more balanced options with their own unique advantages.

**Durability and Longevity:** The cup's ability to withstand repeated use,dishwashing,and potential impacts is essential for its long-term value.glass cups should be tempered or made of borosilicate glass to resist shattering. Ceramic cups should be resistant to chipping and cracking. Stainless steel cups should be corrosion-resistant.Plastic cups should be made of durable, food-grade materials that won't degrade over time.

Depending on the use case, durability will be a major concern for potential customers. Single uses require disposable cups. Multiple uses require a solid, durable cup.

1mowyzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Glittering-Author929/comments/1mowyzr/how_much_do_i_need_for_retirement/,How much do I need for retirement?,"Close your eyes and picture this: You‚Äôre finally retired ‚Äì now you are free in your desire as you can do what you want and when you want. You are sipping coffee on a sunny porch, traveling the world, or pursuing hobbies without a 9-to-5 grind. But then reality hits‚Ä¶ Open your eyes. Do you have enough money to make it last?

The truth is, most people **underestimate** their retirement needs or worse, avoid thinking about it until it‚Äôs too late. Whether you dream of a frugal, simple life or a lavish retirement with endless vacations, the key question remains: **How much is enough?**

This isn't just some abstract financial question ‚Äì it's **your future happiness** on the line. The crushing truth? Millions of people wake up at 65 realizing they're trapped:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **They followed the ""rules""** but didn't save enough (thanks, inflation);

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **They forgot about medical disasters** that could wipe out savings in months.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†**They trusted vague advice** like ""Save $1 million!"" ‚Äì only to find it wasn't nearly enough.

But here's the good news: **It's not too late.** Whether you're 25 or 55, this guide will show you:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **The heartbreaking mistakes** that ruin retirements (and how to avoid them)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **The REAL number you need** (not some generic formula ‚Äì your number)

This isn't just about money. It's about **never feeling helpless**. It's about **looking forward to your future instead of fearing it**. Let's fight for the retirement you deserve starting right now.

**The heartbreaking mistakes** **that ruin retirements (and how to avoid them)**

There are 3 dangerous mistakes:

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Ignoring health care costs**

Retirement is supposed to be about relaxation, travel, and enjoying the fruits of your labor but nothing derails those dreams faster than **unexpected healthcare costs**. Many retirees assume Medicare will cover everything, only to face shocking medical bills that drain their savings.

The harsh reality? **Healthcare is the single biggest expense in retirement and most people drastically underestimate it.**

To overcome such difficulties in future follow the pieces of advice:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Estimate your future healthcare costs** (use AARP‚Äôs calculator).

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Maximize HSA contributions** if eligible.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Research long-term care insurance before 65.**

**¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Medicare options at least 6 months before retiring.**

**2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Relying too much on social security**

Social Security was **never meant to be a full retirement plan** ‚Äì yet **40% of retirees** depend on it for **most of their income**.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The average monthly benefit is **just $1,800** (2024).

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Future benefits may be **cut** if funding issues aren‚Äôt resolved.

To overcome such difficulties in future follow the pieces of advice:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Delay claiming until 70** (boosts benefits by **8% per year** after full retirement age).

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Treat Social Security as supplemental income**, not your main source.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Maximize retirement accounts** (401(k), IRA, Roth IRA) to reduce reliance on it.

**3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Failing to adjust to inflation**

Failing to adjust for inflation and retirement are deeply interconnected because inflation erodes the purchasing power of your savings over time. If retirement planning doesn‚Äôt account for inflation, retirees risk outliving their money or experiencing a significant decline in their standard of living.

To overcome such difficulties in future follow the pieces of advice:

¬∑¬† I**nvest in growth assets** (stocks, real estate) even in retirement.

¬∑¬† **Use TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)** for part of your bond allocation.

¬∑¬† **Review your withdrawal strategy** annually to adjust for rising costs.

**The REAL number you need**

For years, financial experts have thrown around magic numbers like ""$1 million"" or ""10 times your salary"" for retirement. But here's the painful truth: **these one-size-fits-all numbers are dangerously misleading**. Your real retirement number depends on:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Your lifestyle expectations

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Healthcare needs

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Where you'll live

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† How long you'll live

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Market conditions

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tax strategies

A 35-year-old tech worker in San Francisco will need a completely different nest egg than a 55-year-old teacher in rural Ohio. Let's calculate YOUR real number.

**The 4-Step Formula to Find Your Personal Retirement Number**

**Step 1: Calculate Your Annual Retirement Budget**

Start with your current annual spending, then adjust for retirement:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Essential Expenses** (non-negotiable costs):

o¬†¬†¬† Housing (mortgage/rent, property taxes, maintenance)

o¬†¬†¬† Utilities

o¬†¬†¬† Groceries

o¬†¬†¬† Healthcare (premiums + out-of-pocket)

o¬†¬†¬† Transportation

o¬†¬†¬† Insurance

2.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Discretionary Expenses** (lifestyle choices):

o¬†¬†¬† Travel

o¬†¬†¬† Hobbies

o¬†¬†¬† Dining out

o¬†¬†¬† Gifts

3.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Add 15% Buffer** for unexpected costs

\*Example: If you spend $60,000 now, retirement might cost $75,000/year with travel and healthcare.\*

**Step 2: Apply the 4% Rule (Then Adjust It)**

The classic 4% rule says you can withdraw 4% annually without running out of money. But in 2024, many experts suggest 3-3.5% for safety.

**Formula: Annual Expenses √∑ Safe Withdrawal Rate = Target Nest Egg**

* $75,000 √∑ 0.04 = $1.875 million
* $75,000 √∑ 0.035 = $2.14 million (more conservative)

**Step 3: Factor in Other Income Sources**

Reduce your target by guaranteed income:

* Social Security ($20,000-$40,000/year)
* Pensions
* Rental income
* Annuities

\*Example: $75,000 needed - $30,000 Social Security = $45,000 from savings ‚Üí $45,000 √∑ 0.035 = $1.29 million needed\*

**Step 4: Location & Tax Adjustments**

Multiply your number by:

* 0.9 if moving to a low-cost area
* 1.2 if staying in HCOL area
* Add 10-20% for taxes unless using Roth accounts

**The Shocking Reality Most People Miss**

1.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Healthcare Will Cost More Than You Think**

o¬†¬†¬† Add $150,000-$300,000 per couple for medical expenses beyond Medicare

2.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Inflation is a Silent Killer**

o¬†¬†¬† At 3% inflation, every $50,000 of today's spending becomes $90,000 in 20 years

3.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Longevity Risk is Real**

o¬†¬†¬† If you retire at 60, your money may need to last 30-40 years

**Your Personal Retirement Calculator**

Use this formula to find your exact number:

¬†\[ (Annual Expenses - Guaranteed Income) √∑ Safe Withdrawal Rate (0.03-0.04) \] √ó Location Factor + Healthcare Buffer = YOUR Retirement Number

*Example Calculation:*

* ($75,000 - $30,000) √∑ 0.035 = $1.29 million
* $1.29 million √ó 1.1 (taxes) = $1.42 million
* Add $200,000 healthcare = $1.62 million target

**Remember:** Your retirement number isn't static. Recalculate every 2-3 years as your situation changes. The power is in your hands to build the retirement you deserve ‚Äì ¬†starting today.

The Eiffel Tower blazed with golden light against the winter sky, its iron lattice transformed into a beacon counting down the final hours of the millennium. Along the Seine, crowds gathered in layers of wool and wonder, breath steaming in the cold air as they waited for midnight to usher in not just a new year, but a new age.

In the windows of apartments and caf√©s, screens flickered with images from around the world. Sydney's harbor had already erupted in fireworks. London's Thames pulsed with celebration. The global countdown had begun, and Paris, eternal Paris, prepared to add its voice to the chorus of a planet marking time.

But in the quiet corners of Montmartre, where narrow streets wound between buildings that had witnessed centuries pass like seasons, a different kind of gathering was taking place.

At Caf√© de Flore, the same establishment where Marcel Dubois had once written his treatise on souls, the lights burned low despite the celebration outside. The caf√© had weathered decades since the war ended, had seen the liberation, the reconstruction, the student riots of '68, the rise of computers and the internet. Yet something timeless lingered in its atmosphere, as if the very walls held memories too precious to renovate away.

Professor Am√©lie Laurent sat alone at a table near the window, her laptop computer glowing with blue light. At thirty-five, she was young for a professor of comparative literature at the Sorbonne, but her dissertation on ""Mythological Interventions in Wartime Narratives"" had earned her recognition throughout academic circles. Tonight, she was putting finishing touches on her latest paper about a curious manuscript discovered in an estate sale, a work of magical realism written by one Marcel Dubois during the occupation.

The manuscript told the story of a mysterious stranger who had appeared in this very caf√© during the darkest days of Nazi rule, offering impossible bargains and supernatural aid to the resistance. Am√©lie had spent months researching the historical context, interviewing elderly Parisians who claimed to remember strange events from that time. Most dismissed the stories as folklore born from trauma and desperation. But the details were remarkably consistent across different sources, all describing the same tall man with mismatched eyes.

She took a sip of her coffee and glanced at her watch. Eleven forty-seven. In thirteen minutes, the new millennium would begin, and with it, perhaps, the end of such old stories. The world was becoming digital, connected, rational. Magic, if it had ever existed, seemed to be running out of places to hide.

The bell above the caf√© door chimed softly.

Am√©lie looked up from her screen and felt her breath catch in her throat.

A tall man in an elegant dark coat stood in the doorway, brushing snowflakes from his shoulders with slow, deliberate motions, as though reluctant to let the last fragments of the storm leave him. The coat itself was of a fine cut, the sort of garment tailored for an age when formality still carried the weight of ritual, and it clung to him as if it had been shaped to his frame alone. 

His hair, silver now and gleaming faintly in the lamplight, bore the soft disarray of travel and the weight of decades, yet his face, its lines faint and artfully hidden by shadow, remained remarkably youthful, as though time had been persuaded to show him only selective mercy.

Most striking of all were his eyes. One was green, deep and alive as spring leaves after rain, holding within it a promise of renewal, or perhaps a warning of what must be broken before renewal comes. The other was black, a perfect, lightless black, like the surface of a midnight well in which no reflection could be seen. Together, they seemed less the features of a man than the marks of some ancient pact, a union of day and night gazing out through a single face.

The silence around him thickened, as if the room itself leaned forward to listen. Snow melted at his feet, pooling into slow, silvered droplets that caught the firelight and shivered before they vanished into the floorboards. He took one step forward, and the air seemed to bend slightly toward him, warmer on one side, colder on the other.

He approached her table with the same fluid grace she had imagined while reading the manuscript, and when he spoke, his voice carried the silk and blade quality that Marcel Dubois had described so vividly.

""Professor Laurent,"" he said, settling into the chair across from her without invitation. ""How fascinating to find someone writing about stories in an age that has forgotten how to believe in them.""

Am√©lie's hands trembled slightly over her keyboard. ""Monsieur Virel, I presume.""

He smiled, and the expression was exactly as she had pictured it, warm and cold simultaneously. ""You've done excellent research. Though I must say, Marcel's account was somewhat dramatized. He always had a flair for the theatrical.""

Around them, the caf√© seemed to grow quieter, as though an invisible hand had gently turned down the volume of the world. The clink of porcelain on saucer, the soft hiss of the espresso machine, the murmur of conversations all receded until they were no more than the faint suggestion of sound, like memories of noise rather than noise itself. The light through the frost-rimmed windows had a muted, sepia quality, making the place feel suspended between the present and some long-forgotten afternoon.

The manager, an elderly man named Henri, drifted between the tables with the unhurried grace of someone who had spent a lifetime perfecting the art of being quietly indispensable. He claimed, though always with a glint in his eye that left one unsure whether to believe him, that his grandfather had worked here during the war, serving bitter coffee and coded messages in the same breath. Now, moving with a rhythm that seemed half habit, half ritual, he carried a silver tray laden with tiny cups, his footsteps so soft they barely disturbed the dusty shafts of light falling across the floor.

There was something almost spectral about him, as if he belonged less to the scene than to the photograph of it, present, yet blurred by time, forever walking that narrow space between memory and the now. Even when he paused at a table to exchange a few words with a customer, his voice seemed to come from a great distance, carried on the air like the lingering strains of a gramophone in another room.

""You're not surprised to see me,"" Virel observed, signaling for coffee with a gesture that made the gesture itself seem like an art form.

""I've been researching you for months,"" Am√©lie replied, fighting to keep her voice steady. ""Either you're an elaborate hoax passed down through generations, or..."" She paused, looking into those impossible eyes. ""Or you're exactly what the stories claim you are.""

""And what do the stories claim?""

""That you're the devil himself, walking among us, making bargains and testing souls.""

Virel laughed, a sound like velvet being torn. ""My dear professor, I am far more complicated than that. I am what appears when humanity reaches a crossroads. I am the question that reveals the answer. Tonight, as your species prepares to step into a new millennium, such questions become rather pressing.""

Henri appeared at their table, moving with the same dreamlike quality Am√©lie had noticed earlier. He set down a silver service with coffee that smelled impossibly rich and pastries that seemed to steam with fresh warmth despite the late hour.

""Some things,"" Virel said, stirring his coffee with a silver spoon that caught light from sources Am√©lie couldn't identify, ""are too important to ration.""

The phrase sent a chill through her. It was the exact line from Marcel's manuscript.

""What do you want?"" she asked.

""The same thing I wanted from Marcel and Marguerite fifty-seven years ago. Proof that humanity deserves the future it's walking toward.""

Outside, the sounds of celebration swelled, rolling in waves through the narrow streets as if the whole city had been caught in a single breathless moment. Car horns blared in irregular bursts, some in jubilation, others simply because noise itself had become a kind of shared language. Laughter rose and fell like the tide, mingling with the rough edges of drunken songs sung in a dozen different keys but with the same unshakable joy.

From somewhere down the boulevard came the rhythmic beat of a drum, joined by the metallic rattle of tambourines, a street band improvising an anthem for the night. Above it all, the first fireworks began to bloom, their blossoms of gold and red unfurling in sudden brilliance against the deep winter sky. Each explosion left a brief ghost of light drifting across the darkness before fading into nothing.

In the glow of shopfronts and lamplight, faces shone, strangers greeting strangers, children waving sparklers like captured stars. Even the snow seemed to join in, catching the light and falling in slow, deliberate spirals, as though reluctant to touch the ground while the city danced beneath it.

""The world is about to change,"" Virel continued. ""In ways your generation cannot imagine. You think the internet is revolutionary? You think global communication is the pinnacle of human connection? What's coming next will make tonight's celebrations seem quaint.""

He gestured, and Am√©lie's laptop screen flickered. Instead of her academic paper, images began to flow across the display. She saw futures both wonderful and terrible: cities of light rising from the earth, but also masses of people staring into screens, isolated despite being more connected than ever before. She saw medical miracles and environmental disasters, artificial intelligences that could compose symphonies and weapons that could end civilizations.

""Beautiful and horrifying,"" she whispered.

""Precisely. The question is whether the human heart can evolve as quickly as human technology. Whether love can grow as fast as power. Whether wisdom can match knowledge.""

""And if it can't?""

Virel's expression grew serious. ""Then this is the last century where stories like Marcel's are possible. Where mystery and magic can coexist with reason. Where souls can surprise even those who've been watching them for millennia.""

Am√©lie felt something stir within her, a recognition similar to what Marcel must have experienced. Around them, the caf√© continued to exist in its strange bubble of timelessness, but she could feel the weight of the approaching moment, the turn of centuries that would reshape everything.

""What would you have me do?""

""Write,"" he said simply. ""Not about the past, but about what's coming. Help your species remember that no matter how smart your machines become, no matter how fast your world changes, the most important questions remain the same. What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to love? What does it mean to choose hope when despair would be easier?""

He reached into his coat and withdrew a fountain pen, its surface gleaming with the same impossible light as Henri's silver service. ""This belonged to Marcel. He would want you to have it.""

Am√©lie took the pen, feeling its weight, warm and alive in her fingers. As she touched it, words began to flow through her mind, not her own thoughts but something larger, older, more connected to the vast story that humanity was still writing.

""The world is about to become very loud,"" Virel said, rising from his chair. ""Very fast. Very overwhelming. Someone needs to remind people that the most important stories are still the quiet ones. The ones about ordinary people making extraordinary choices. The ones about love persisting in darkness.""

Through the caf√© windows, the crowd outside had begun counting down. Ten. Nine. Eight.

""Will I see you again?"" Am√©lie asked.

""When the next crossroads appears,"" he replied. ""When humanity needs another reminder that miracles are still possible.""

Seven. Six. Five.

Virel walked toward the door, but paused and looked back. ""Oh, and Professor? Don't try to prove I existed. That's not the point. The point is to prove that what I represent exists. The mystery. The possibility. The hope.""

Four. Three. Two.

He stepped outside into the swirling snow and celebrating crowds.

One.

The new millennium arrived with explosions of light and sound, fireworks painting the Parisian sky in brilliant colors, horns and voices rising in a chorus of joy and anticipation. Through her window, Am√©lie watched the Eiffel Tower blaze even brighter, its golden glow reflecting off the Seine like a river of stars.

When she looked back toward the door, Virel was gone. But Henri stood there, no longer moving like a figure in a dream but alert and present, as if he'd just awakened from a long sleep.

""Professor?"" he said, approaching her table. ""Is everything all right? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

Am√©lie glanced down at her laptop. Her academic paper was gone, replaced by something new. A story. A story about a young professor in a caf√© on New Year's Eve, about a stranger with mismatched eyes, about the eternal dance between mystery and reason, between old magic and new worlds.

She picked up Marcel's fountain pen and added a single line: ""And so the story continues, because some truths are too important to end.""

Outside, Paris celebrated the future. Inside the caf√©, the past and present and future wove themselves together like threads in an endless tapestry, reminding anyone who cared to listen that no matter how much the world changed, the human heart remained both fragile and indestructible, ordinary and miraculous, forever capable of surprise.

The pen felt warm in her hand as she began to write, adding her voice to a story that had been telling itself for centuries, would continue telling itself for centuries more. In the margins of history, in the quiet corners where love persisted and hope refused to die, the magic continued.

And somewhere in the celebrating crowds, a large black dog with amber eyes might have been seen walking calmly through the chaos, his silver collar catching the light of fireworks, his presence a reminder that some things endure beyond the turning of calendars, beyond the changing of ages.

The seamstress and the professor, the devil and the divine, the old stories and the new, all part of the same great tapestry that weaves itself through history, reminding us that in every era, in every moment of transition, light finds a way.",1,1755065933.0,fantasy_books,0,1.0,False
