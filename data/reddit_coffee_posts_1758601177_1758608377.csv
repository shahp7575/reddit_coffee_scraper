It wasn‚Äôt that book the flat man, though, so maybe I am confusing memories. But this author had a few different short books that had me and my fellow elementary schoolers obsessed. One page would have the text, on a light brown page (looked coffee stained) with a ‚Äúvictorian‚Äù or vampirey font. The other page would have these insanely cool illustrations, the faces didn‚Äôt have too much detail, it was just about how creepy they were. The colors were always that coffee stain and black/shading. I think the books always had a man in them who was not relevant to the story about the monster itself, rather an easter egg, and he was always in black with bats around him. Bats were used in all of the books a lot even if they weren‚Äôt particularly about bats. I think there was even a rumor in my elementary school that the man in the drawings (often seen at a desk or walking in a dark hall) was the illustrator drawing himself?

1no9ta7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantLiberty/comments/1no9ta7/war_on_drugs/,War on drugs,"I really hate it. How the government dictates what I can and can‚Äôt do when it‚Äôs only my own body being affected. When a drug I do in the privacy of my own home that affects no one else aside from the consequences that so many people face from the federal government making it illegal. Why does it matter what I put into my body if I don‚Äôt hurt anyone else from doing it? Alcohol probably hurts more people than the illegal drugs ever could. Even when the federal government‚Äôs own actions cause the death and pain to inflate in huge proportions. Imagine a country where gangs aren‚Äôt killing each other so they have more territory to make more money from selling drugs. Where drugs are so cheap, that barely any drug users rob people so they can get more. Where the cartel has barely any influence because the government can sell it cheaper and cut out a lot of middlemen, so they lose a bunch of henchmen because they took a huge hit on their profit and people won‚Äôt see it as worth it. Where the national debt is none existent from all the tax money earned, even though I believe there should be no taxes for as long as they made it illegal, when so many people were put in prison for insane lengths, and killed because dealers or users would rather die in a shootout than go to prison for unjustifiably long terms. No more going to shady places with shady people where you go to buy, but get robbed instead. Where you know the purity that‚Äôs not laced or cut. The government was probably well meaning, seeing a problem and using laws to try to erase it. But they took a slight problem, and made cities ruined. Innovations never take place. One of those prisoners, might have been the one to finally completely cure cancer. But he was shanked and died in prison from simply watching a gang fight. The gang that would have never been built. Except there‚Äôs always, ALWAYS, a demand, so there will always be a supply. And when you live in the dark, because it‚Äôs illegal to do something, you do dark things. If the government didn‚Äôt make it illegal, but made the drugs that don‚Äôt make people go insane accessible, this would be a better place. Is it LIBERTY if you can‚Äôt even choose your state of mind? Did you just wake up and feel groggy? That coffee you‚Äôre about to drink changes your state of mind, so imagine if that choice and ability to drink it was taken away because a government decided you have to have a natural state of thought. That chocolate, it makes your brain release endorphins when you eat it, it‚Äôs illegal. For public health, all processed and man-made products are made illegal. It might not happen now, but a decade or century from now, there might be a day when public health is so important to the government with the power they receive from that excuse, that liberty has no importance. I fear that day but I probably won‚Äôt be alive by then hopefully.

So my trauma of the dentist started at a young age, witnessing my 10 year old brother have a procedure without any anaesthetic. This was in the early 90s in UK under NHS.

Since then, dental appointments have been few, usually only with sedation, and my last visit was now over 15 years ago (when I was told a root canal was required but I didn't get it done).

Unfortunately through unrelated depression, I have not maintained good oral hygiene, but have somehow skated by without pain or issue.

Living now in Australia, dental work is extremely expensive, with basic things like crowns costing thousands, and nos running close to $200 per 15 minutes. 

To look at, my teeth don't look particularly bad, but I know that's not the full story. I have been telling myself I'll just wait until I save enough for all on four, because it'll be about the same as repairing what's there and will look far better. 

Am I kidding myself? How do I even get started again knowing how much work is going to be required? And can I tell the dentist upfront not to use that picky thing they scrape at the teeth with?

Yes I sound like a 5 year old, but promise I'm a 40 year old man who is simply terrified of where to go. My only saving grace is I don't drink alcohol or coffee or smoke. But I know 15 years with no care is going to be bad news. ",1,1758607211.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
1no9kj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeAdmissionGuide/comments/1no9kj8/budgeting_for_college_what_you_need_to_know/,Budgeting for College: What You Need to Know,"Starting college is exciting. New friends, new classes, maybe even living on your own. But then comes reality ‚Äî money. Suddenly, you‚Äôre the one responsible for paying for groceries, textbooks, transport, and the occasional coffee run. And if you aren‚Äôt careful, it‚Äôs easy to burn through your cash faster than you thought.

That‚Äôs why learning to budget is a game-changer. It‚Äôs not about strict rules or cutting out fun. It‚Äôs about knowing where your money goes, avoiding stress, and still enjoying college life. Here‚Äôs how to get it right.

**Why Budgeting Actually Matters**

Some students think budgeting is boring, or worse, unnecessary. And yeah, it sounds dull when you hear ‚Äútrack every dollar.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî without a plan, money slips through your fingers before you even notice.

A budget helps you:

* **See where your money goes** (you might be shocked by those tiny, repeated purchases).
* **Avoid debt** (credit cards and loans add up fast).
* **Focus on essentials** without feeling deprived.
* **Build savings habits** for emergencies or fun things later.

Think of it as a roadmap ‚Äî not a prison sentence.

**Step 1: Figure Out Your Income**

First, know exactly what‚Äôs coming in. This might include:

* Part-time job wages
* Scholarships or grants
* Parental support
* Student loans

Add everything up. If your income varies, use an average. For example, if you earn $600 one month and $900 the next, consider $750 for planning purposes. Knowing your income lets you decide realistically what you can spend.

**Step 2: Track Your Spending**

Next, figure out where your money goes. Divide it into three buckets:

1. **Fixed costs** ‚Äî rent, tuition, insurance. Stuff that doesn‚Äôt change month to month.
2. **Variable costs** ‚Äî groceries, transport, utilities. These fluctuate a bit.
3. **Discretionary spending** ‚Äî coffee, eating out, streaming services, shopping.

Keep a simple spending journal. Write down everything, even $2 snacks. Seriously, those small buys sneak up.

**Step 3: Prioritize Essentials**

Now that you know your income and spending habits, decide what matters most. Essentials always come first ‚Äî rent, bills, and food. Then cover variable costs, and finally, some discretionary spending.

Here‚Äôs an example of a simple monthly plan:

|Category|Amount|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent|$500|Shared apartment or dorm|
|Groceries|$200|Cooking at home saves money|
|Transport|$100|Public transport or fuel|
|Utilities & internet|$100|Electricity, water, Wi-Fi|
|Study materials|$50|Books, supplies|
|Entertainment|$150|Social outings, hobbies|
|Savings|$200|Emergency fund or future use|
|**Total**|$1,300|Leaves $200 for unexpected costs|

See how it balances necessities, fun, and savings? And no, you don‚Äôt have to cut out coffee completely ‚Äî just be mindful.

**Step 4: Build an Emergency Fund**

Unexpected expenses happen. Phones break, laptops die, medical bills pop up. Having a small emergency fund ‚Äî even $200 to start ‚Äî can save a lot of stress.

Start small. Save $10 or $20 per week. Before long, you‚Äôll have a cushion without even noticing. Trust me, it feels good to have that safety net.

**Step 5: Cut Costs Smartly**

Budgeting isn‚Äôt about going without. It‚Äôs about being smart. A few ideas:

* Cook instead of ordering takeaway (your wallet and your health will thank you).
* Share subscriptions with friends (Netflix, Spotify, whatever).
* Buy or rent second-hand textbooks.
* Always look for student discounts.

Little changes make a big difference over time. And honestly, you won‚Äôt feel deprived ‚Äî just wiser with your cash.

**Step 6: Use Simple Tools**

You don‚Äôt need fancy apps or software. A notebook or a spreadsheet works fine. Or if you like tech, budgeting apps can track spending and remind you about bills.

Even a simple calendar reminder ‚Äî ‚Äúpay rent‚Äù or ‚Äútransfer $20 to savings‚Äù ‚Äî helps you stay on top. It‚Äôs all about building habits.

**Step 7: Review and Adjust**

Budgeting isn‚Äôt one-and-done. At the end of each month, check:

* Did I stick to the plan?
* Where did I overspend?
* Can I tweak something for next month?

Adjust your plan as needed. Flexibility is key. Life isn‚Äôt predictable, and your budget shouldn‚Äôt be rigid.

**Step 8: Allow Fun**

College isn‚Äôt just about survival. Social life and hobbies matter. Budget some money for fun. Even $50 a month can cover a few nights out or a new game.

And if you don‚Äôt spend it, let it roll into your savings. Over time, it adds up ‚Äî sometimes faster than you expect.

**Step 9: Watch Out for Money Traps**

Some mistakes are easy to make:

* **Impulse buys:** ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only $5‚Äù turns into $50 in a week.
* **Credit card reliance:** Interest accumulates quickly.
* **Small subscriptions you forget about:** Those $10-a-month apps pile up.

Awareness is half the battle. Once you know the traps, you can avoid them.

**Step 10: Seek Help if Needed**

It‚Äôs normal to feel overwhelmed with money management at first. Ask parents, mentors, or even friends for advice. There are also online resources and services designed for students to help plan budgets and manage expenses.

**Final Thoughts**

Budgeting doesn‚Äôt have to be scary. Start by knowing your income, tracking your spending, and prioritising essentials. Build a small emergency fund, review your spending, and leave some room for fun.

It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs about developing habits that will carry you through college and beyond. Even small, consistent steps matter. Take control, plan a little, and enjoy your time at college without the stress of unexpected financial surprises.",1,1758607105.0,CollegeAdmissionGuide,0,1.0,False
1no9k3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1no9k3s/how_a_flexible_packaging_manufacturer_improves/,How a Flexible Packaging Manufacturer Improves Shelf Appeal and Shelf Life,"In today‚Äôs competitive retail world, grabbing a consumer‚Äôs attention is just as crucial as maintaining product freshness. That‚Äôs where flexible packaging truly shines. From bold graphics to advanced barrier technology, this modern packaging solution is helping brands not only stand out on shelves but also preserve product quality for longer periods.

**1. Eye-Catching Design Possibilities**  
One of the biggest advantages of flexible packaging is its ability to support vibrant, high-resolution printing. Whether it's stand-up pouches, flat-bottom bags, or resealable zipper packs, the material allows for detailed imagery and attractive finishes like matte, gloss, or metallic effects. These design options capture attention quickly, influence purchasing decisions, and strengthen brand identity at the point of sale.

**2. Innovative Shapes and Structures**  
Unlike rigid packaging, flexible materials can be formed into unique shapes that cater to consumer convenience and product differentiation. Pouches with spouts, handles, or easy-tear notches offer both visual appeal and user-friendly experiences. These structural innovations make products easier to use, store, and reseal‚Äîattributes that modern shoppers value highly.

**3. Superior Shelf Life with Advanced Barriers**  
The real magic happens behind the scenes. Flexible packaging offers exceptional protective properties through multi-layer films designed to block out oxygen, moisture, light, and other contaminants. This ensures the product inside stays fresher for longer‚Äîextending its shelf life and reducing food waste. Whether it‚Äôs coffee, snacks, pet food, or frozen goods, maintaining product integrity is essential for customer satisfaction.

**4. Lightweight and Space-Efficient**  
Beyond looks and protection, flexible packaging is also about efficiency. It‚Äôs lighter than glass or rigid plastic and takes up less space during storage and transportation. That means lower shipping costs, a reduced carbon footprint, and more products displayed per shelf. Retailers love this benefit just as much as manufacturers do.

**5. Consumer Convenience Matters**  
Features like resealable zippers, tear notches, and clear windows not only elevate the package's functionality but also improve the user experience. When customers find packaging easy to open, reseal, and store, they‚Äôre more likely to become repeat buyers. It's a subtle detail that makes a huge impact.

In conclusion, a **flexible packaging manufacturer** plays a critical role in enhancing both shelf appeal and shelf life. With innovative design, protective technology, and consumer-focused features, flexible packaging continues to reshape the way products are displayed, preserved, and enjoyed by consumers around the world.",1,1758607063.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

1no9giq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1no9giq/features_to_look_for_in_standard_pouch_packaging/,Features to Look For in Standard Pouch Packaging,"When it comes to choosing the right pouch packaging, there are a few essential features that can make a big difference in the product's shelf appeal, freshness, and overall user experience. Whether you're packaging snacks, powders, liquids, or anything in between, the right pouch should offer more than just storage‚Äîit should enhance your brand image and preserve your product‚Äôs quality. Let‚Äôs explore the must-have features that ensure your pouch packaging does the job right.

**1. High-Quality Barrier Protection**  
One of the most crucial aspects of any pouch packaging is its ability to protect the contents from external elements. Look for pouches with high-barrier films that keep out moisture, oxygen, and light. This feature is especially vital for perishable or sensitive products like coffee, tea, or powdered supplements. A good barrier not only maintains freshness but also extends shelf life, helping your products stay in top condition longer.

**2. Resealability and Convenience**  
Consumers love convenience, and resealable pouches offer exactly that. Zippers, spouts, and tear notches make pouches easier to open, use, and store. Resealable options also help reduce waste by allowing customers to consume the product over time without losing freshness. If you're targeting a market that values practicality, this is a feature you can't afford to skip.

**3. Sustainability and Eco-Friendly Materials**  
With more consumers becoming environmentally conscious, sustainable packaging is no longer just a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs an expectation. Choosing pouches made from recyclable or compostable materials shows a commitment to the planet, and this resonates with today‚Äôs green-minded buyers. Biodegradable films or recyclable plastics not only reduce environmental impact but also enhance your brand's reputation.

**4. Customization and Branding Potential**  
Pouch packaging offers a large canvas for eye-catching graphics, vibrant colors, and brand messaging. Customizable options allow businesses to stand out on store shelves and connect with consumers instantly. From matte finishes to metallic inks and transparent windows, the design possibilities are endless and can be tailored to match your brand‚Äôs personality perfectly.

**5. Durability and Strength**  
A good pouch must be tough enough to withstand handling, transportation, and storage without bursting or leaking. Tear-resistant and puncture-proof materials ensure your product arrives intact and in excellent condition. This boosts customer satisfaction and reduces return rates due to packaging issues.

In conclusion, **standard pouch packaging** should deliver on functionality, sustainability, and visual appeal. By focusing on these key features, you can ensure your packaging stands out, protects your product, and delights your customers from the first use to the last.",1,1758606688.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

I thought I'd treat my BFF to sbux with my discount the other day, and she always loved the Java Chip. We went to a store close to her house.

I let her know that it's not a menu item anymore, but I'd build it in my order the best way I knew how.

I ordered a mocha frap add java chips and mocha drizzle, and the partner seemed confused and distraught. She said ""Um, we have something called a Mocha Cookie Crumble that's really similar. Would you like that instead??""

I said ""Oh! No thanks! Just a mocha frap with Frap Chips and Mocha drizzle please!""

Still thinking I was a confused custie, she continued ""It just has extra whip on the bottom. It's basically the same thing! Can I ring you up for a Cookie Crumble??""

That's when I made the mistake of saying ""I'm really just looking for what used to be the Java Chip. Can it just be a mocha frap, add Frap Chips and Mocha Drizzle, please?""

She must've been really new. She went off-mic for like 60 seconds, where I assume she was asking for help. I'm still not sure why she didn't just ring it up! I'm not sure which way is technically the cheapest way, but I was just trying to make it simple for the person working the register!

When she came back, she said ""Okay. Did you want that creme based? The Java Chip was a creme frappucino.""

I really didn't want to be an ass! I feel like it would've been so weird to be like ""NO IT WASN'T"" but I was lowkey getting so frustrated at this point!

So I just said, for a FOURTH time! ""I'd love it with coffee. Could it just be a Mocha Frap with Frap Chips and Mocha Drizzle?""

and she finally said, so condescendingly! ""Okaaay? Pull up to the window.""

I felt like such a jerk, even when I gave her my partner numbers! I never want to be that customer who's like ""You don't know how to do your job"" But that's why I tried to build it in a really neutral way!

This is my second attempt, and I recently figured out why I didn‚Äôt pass. My understanding of the domain topics back then was very vague. Now, while I still don‚Äôt fully understand some topics, I can confidently say that I am much better prepared this time.

Last year, when I took the exam, I felt devastated and even joked that I developed PTSD :D. Because of that, I took a break from reviewing for a while. I started again in April and committed to five months of focused study. With a baby on the way, I‚Äôm grateful to have passed before my little one arrives.

For the exam itself: I spent about 10 minutes on the first 20 questions, which were mostly knowledge-based. By question #60, I had used less than 60 minutes. From questions 61‚Äì99, I stayed under 100 minutes. By the time I reached question 100, I was hoping the exam would end, but I kept going through 125 and then 150. At question 125, I still had 30 minutes left, and I reminded myself that I really needed to focus. I also remembered the posts here that said *‚Äúthe exam wants you to pass.‚Äù* That mindset helped me push through, focus on the questions, and choose the closest possible answers.

These resources are very helpful for me to pass the exam!

1. Destination Certifications (Mindmaps, App, and Destination CISSP: The Concise Guide) ‚Äì Outstanding for visual learning, challenging practice questions, and quick reference across all domains.

2. Pete Zerger, vCISO, CISSP (The Last Mile & CISSP Exam Cram) ‚Äì Excellent for concise domain reviews and a great overall summary.

3. Mike Chapple (LinkedIn Learning) & Thor Pedersen - Lead trainer at ThorTeaches (Udemy) ‚Äì Clear explanations and deep dives into complex topics.

4. Some additional videos to reinforce CISSP concepts/mindsets

\- Prabh Nair's Coffee Shots

\- Guenevere (Gwen) Bettwy (Ààbet Ààwƒì) How to Think Like a Manager & Test Tips by Tactical Security Inc. ‚Äì Excellent mindset and test-taking strategy

\- Andrew Ramdayal 50 Questions from Technical Institute of America ‚Äì Great for testing knowledge under exam-like conditions.

Now I can move forward and complete the endorsement process. This subreddit has been super helpful, and I‚Äôve been encouraged not only by the passing posts of members here but also by those who shared their failures.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ten thirty am and no, you haven't driven into the Twilight Zone. I‚Äôm here on six gallons of coffee, a wing, and a prayer, to bring you an exclusive interview with our favorite band. I‚Äôm Junie-Junebug, and you are listening to Hangdog City Radio.‚Äù 

JJ drops the needle on a record and switches off her mic. 

The records are vinyl, the needle looks real, but the rest is all Marasat tech. It will just keep switching records by itself if you leave it alone, if something goes wrong a Marasat appears like magic. 

The DJs are, as May would put it, aesthetic. 

June steps outside and looks idly over the town. 

JJ had made it up to ‚ÄòScience Officer‚Äô, or ‚ÄúUseless Doctor‚Äù according to May, and been stationed on Rycacia already when May got booted down here. 

She‚Äôs still on ISTC payroll, technically she‚Äôs in charge of maintaining soil quality and shit, but as long as the Marasats understand the parameters, they can deal with all of that. 

Everything here except the badlands, and some of the fauna, is part of one large organism. Or rather, it's a very large colony of several kinds of tiny organisms. 

They‚Äôre basically just little chemical factories when you get down to it, and were probably what allowed surface life to begin with. 

The Marasats have a symbiotic relationship with the stuff, they can manipulate it to produce whatever chemical or physical array they like. 

They can also do something else, which is why ISTC is actually hanging around. 

A cloud of dust is coming up the road, and JJ goes back inside. 

She‚Äôs interviewed Factory Road before, they come out here occasionally to visit Dusty‚Äôs family and are always happy to be on the radio. 

‚ÄúHey, guys.‚Äù JJ says on the air. ‚ÄúLadies and gentlefolk, Factory Deal. How have you guys been?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI pull in, my goddamn cousin took a swing at me!‚Äù Dusty barks. The band laughs. 

‚ÄúOh, good, y‚Äôall made up.‚Äù JJ says. 

They take turns talking for the next 45 minutes, play a couple songs. 

As they are putting the guitars down, JJ gets a message from the Marasats. It‚Äôs in English, as always, they can learn other languages but generally refuse to. 

‚ÄúHang on, guys, I‚Äôm getting a request. ‚ÄòCan you play live in the park tomorrow night‚Äô. Gee, I don't think I have that one.‚Äù JJ says. 

‚ÄúWhat do you say, guys, wanna hang out a couple more days?‚Äù Dusty asks. 

‚ÄúYou heard it here, folks, party in the park.‚Äù JJ says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Junie-Junebug, and you are listening to Hangdog City Radio.‚Äù


When JJ gets home, she finds May and that other Officer Fuckup she likes to run around with. 

‚ÄúYou stealing my horses?‚Äù JJ asks. 

‚ÄúBringing them back.‚Äù May says. ‚ÄúNeeded a couple ATVs to get up to Fern Hill.‚Äù

JJ arches an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat do you want with that old place?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you know about it?‚Äù May asks. 

‚ÄúAside from that it's supposed to be haunted, nothing.‚Äù JJ says. 

‚ÄúYou ever see a big red fella, kinda like a snake with feathers? Bout the size of the barn?‚Äù May asks. 

JJ laughs. ‚ÄúHattie does have that‚Ä¶thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not Rocky.‚Äù May says. ‚ÄúThis is more like something that would live in an ocean.‚Äù

JJ shakes her head. ‚ÄúNah, nothing like that. Did you see something like that up there?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I mean kinda, there's a painting of one. But there was one over at Layla's house, in that pond.‚Äù May says. ‚ÄúMust be using the cave system.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I don't do wildlife shit.‚Äù JJ says. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that's the problem.‚Äù May says.

My daughter is 19mo and has had an intense preference for me (her mum) for around 3 or 4 months now. She‚Äôs always so excited to see her dad and will play with him happily but he‚Äôs not allowed to put her to bed or go in if she wakes in the night. 
Generally whatever we‚Äôre doing (bath, tea time, book reading etc) If I‚Äôm there she‚Äôll scream at him to go away and cry until I take over. If I‚Äôm not there they get on pretty well.

It felt like the mum preference was easing off a month or so ago but it‚Äôs back now stronger than ever. But still quite selective as sometimes she‚Äôs happy for him to get her in the morning or carry her while he makes a coffee for example.

I‚Äôve never posted before, but wanted to share a positive experience with Wellbutrin. Three years ago I finally got up the nerve to ask my physician for help. I‚Äôd been in chronic pain, chronic fatigue, and depression for most of my twenties and early thirties and got desperate enough to ask for help. I knew what I wanted, after seeing friends with similar constitutions get results from Wellbutrin so I asked for it directly (as well as physical therapy). My doctor was kind and receptive and believed me (!!!!) about my pain and fatigue and depression. He prescribed 150mg Wellbutrin SR once per day for the first week then twice per day going forward. I had about a week of feeling like a superhero (no social anxiety, actually having energy) but also was often nauseated and was having a racing heart to the point where I had to cut out coffee for a week or two. Those things passed and I leveled out. The Wellbutrin along with physical therapy and low dose amitryptaliline actually saved me. I‚Äôm still on both meds three years later with marked success and my only side effect being that I need to take melatonin to fall asleep most nights. Which is fine by me. I was so scared that taking an antidepressant would alter who I was, but I think at the time I was so heavily identified with my depression I couldn‚Äôt imagine a self outside of it. Turns out there is one. I still get depressed occasionally but never to the extent I did before.

This two-day shopping festival is now one of the biggest events leading into the holiday season. If you missed July‚Äôs Prime Day, this October sale gives you a second chance to score massive savings on tech, home essentials, beauty products, and even winter gear.

Redditors across r/Deals, r/Amazon are already buzzing about it. If you‚Äôre searching for¬†‚ÄúAmazon Prime Big Deal Days October 2025 Reddit‚Äù, here‚Äôs a full breakdown of what to expect and how to prepare.

# When Are Amazon Prime Big Deal Days 2025?

The event will run for¬†**48 hours from October 7‚Äì8, 2025**, starting at¬†**12:01 a.m. PT on October 7**¬†and ending at¬†**11:59 p.m. PT on October 8**. It‚Äôs exclusively for Prime members, but even a free trial works. Shoppers should also know that Amazon has already started dropping¬†**early access deals**¬†ahead of the official dates, giving Prime members an advantage if they prepare now.

# Why Reddit Talks About Prime Big Deal Days

Reddit has become one of the most trusted spaces to track Amazon deals because users share raw, unfiltered insights. People post¬†**price-tracking screenshots**¬†to prove whether discounts are real, highlight¬†**hidden coupons and promo codes**¬†Amazon quietly releases, and discuss whether products are worth buying based on¬†**honest first-hand reviews**. This kind of community-driven feedback helps shoppers avoid fake discounts and spot the genuine bargains.

# Categories That Will See the Best Deals

One of the most exciting parts of Prime Big Deal Days is the wide range of categories that go on sale.¬†**Electronics and tech**¬†are always a major highlight, with discounts on smart TVs, laptops, gaming gear, and tablets.¬†**Home and office essentials**¬†like ergonomic chairs and desks also see big price drops, making it the perfect time to upgrade your setup.

Amazon also leans heavily on its ecosystem, so expect¬†**smart home devices**¬†like Alexa speakers, Fire TV sticks, and Ring doorbells to hit record-low prices. Beyond tech,¬†**beauty and personal care**¬†products (think hair dryers, electric shavers, and toothbrushes) tend to get bundled with deep discounts. Since the sale comes just before winter, you‚Äôll also find deals on¬†**jackets, boots, heated blankets, and space heaters**. And, of course,¬†**kitchen appliances**¬†air fryers, coffee machines, and blenders are always heavily discounted crowd favorites.

# Shopping Tips for October 7‚Äì8

Redditors who shop Amazon sales regularly recommend preparing early. Start by¬†**tracking prices in advance**¬†with tools like CamelCamelCamel or Keepa so you know whether a deal is genuine. Many deal hunters also¬†**set up alerts**¬†through Reddit bots or Telegram groups to get instant notifications.

Once the sale is live, you‚Äôll need to¬†**move fast**, especially on Lightning Deals, which often sell out within minutes. Don‚Äôt forget to¬†**compare competitor prices**¬†Walmart, Target, and Best Buy often run parallel sales in October. Finally, remember that Amazon‚Äôs¬†**holiday return policy**¬†usually extends well into January, so shopping now doesn‚Äôt lock you in if you change your mind later.

# What Redditors Say About Last Year‚Äôs Sale

If history repeats itself, October 2025 will be huge. One Redditor mentioned saving¬†**$200 on a gaming laptop**¬†during last year‚Äôs Prime Big Deal Days, while others recalled¬†**Echo Dots dropping to $19.99**¬†a deal that‚Äôs likely to return. At the same time, experienced shoppers warned that some ‚Äú40% off‚Äù deals were misleading, stressing the importance of using price-tracking tools to verify whether discounts are genuine.

# How to Prepare Before October 7

The best preparation starts now. First, make sure your¬†**Prime membership**¬†is active, or sign up for a free trial before the event. Then, build a¬†**wishlist**¬†of items you want - Amazon will alert you when those products go on sale. Following¬†**subreddits like r/Deals**is also key, since they‚Äôll surface hidden discounts in real time. Finally, keep¬†**competitor websites**¬†bookmarked so you can instantly compare prices when the sale kicks off.

**Amazon Prime Big Deal Days 2025 runs October 7‚Äì8.**¬†Expect deep discounts across tech, home office, smart devices, beauty, winter gear, and kitchen appliances.

1no8hri,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychologyOfHabits/comments/1no8hri/throwback_to_when_i_realized_my_morning_routine/,Throwback to when I realized my morning routine actually mattered,"So, I've always been someone who struggled with mornings... Like, waking up early and beinng productive was never my thing. But then I thought, okay, let me try this morning routine thing everyone talks about. For a while now, I start my day with a cup of coffee, 10 minutes of meditation, and a short workout. It felt kinda awjward at first, and I was super skeptical. It's not like I mayically transformed into a morning person, but I did notice a difference in how focused I felt throughout the day.

I think what's happening here is that my brain is getting a mini spa treatent every morning. The coffee wakes me up, the medittion calms my racing thoughts, and the workout energizes me. It's like giving my mind a fresh coat of paint. And tbh, I'm knda lovng it. There's this weeird sense of accomplishment that kicks in. 

I've read somewhere that doing somethnig consistently leads to habit formation through those sweet dopamine hits we get from completing tassks. Maybe it's all about tricking my brain into liking what it's doing. Decision fatgiue is also real, folks. By setting up a routine, I avoid the stress of having to decide what to do every morning. Just autopilot, ya know? 

It's fascinating how a few small changes can reshape your whole day. Curious if anyone else has felt a simliar shift by just tweaking your morning habits. Would love to hear about your routtines or any tips you might have!",9,1758603263.0,PsychologyOfHabits,2,0.92,False

1no8hjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1no8hjd/dirty_intermittent_fasting_because_perfect/,Dirty Intermittent Fasting - because perfect protocols are overrated,"# The DTiF Philosophy: Dirty Intermittent Fasting

**Core Principle:** Consistency at 80-90% beats chasing 100% perfection. Build a sustainable lifestyle, not a rigid prison.

## Key Tenets

**Smart Flexibility:** Your body doesn't flip a binary switch at exactly 12 hours. Don't count beverages - coffee with cream, tea, whatever keeps you going. Only actual food with substance matters. The mental boost from these comforts outweighs any minor metabolic cost.

**Break the All-or-Nothing Trap:** One small deviation doesn't justify torching the whole day. Don't turn coffee with cream into a pizza binge. Small slips don't erase progress - dramatic overreactions do.

**Master Hunger's Rogue Waves:** Hunger hits like rogue waves when you least expect it. Cruising along fine, then BAM, you're ""starving."" Set a 12-minute timer. Like any rogue wave, it looks massive but passes quickly. Most ""emergency"" hunger is just noise.

**Psychology Wins:** Mental freedom from flexibility often delivers better results than perfect execution with constant stress.

## The 20:4 Rolling Window System

**Your One Non-Negotiable:** Always wait at least 20 hours from when you stop eating to when you start again. This is your anchor.

**Life-Proof Eating Windows:** Your eating window flexes from 2-8 hours based on life. Aim for 4 hours baseline. Social dinner? Business lunch? Extend when needed, adjust tomorrow.

**The Simple Math Hack:** When you finish eating, subtract 4 hours - that's tomorrow's earliest start time. Done at 8 PM? Tomorrow opens at 4 PM.

**Social Freedom:** Never be the person who can't join dinner because of their ""eating window.""

## The 20-Hour Floor, Not Ceiling

**Listen, Don't Watch the Clock:** 20 hours is your minimum, not an eating alarm. Feel great? Keep riding to 24, 26, even 28 hours naturally.

**Your Body Knows:** Real hunger differs from clock-based habits. When thriving in the fasted state - clear-headed, energized, focused - why interrupt? Eat when your body actually asks for fuel.

**Natural Cap:** Most find their sweet spot between 20-28 hours. This isn't an endurance contest - it's finding your optimal daily flow.

## The 80-90 Rule

Eat well most of the time, don't stress occasional splurges. Quality fuel makes fasting easier - nutrient-dense foods keep you satisfied 20+ hours, junk leaves you fighting cravings at hour 12. That 10-20% flexibility keeps you human. Pizza happens. Move on.

## Victory Rituals

Lock in wins with non-food rewards when completing your window or hitting milestones. Podcast, walk, music, whatever sparks joy. Train your brain to celebrate the process.

## The DTiF Advantage

You're building a sustainable relationship with food that doesn't control your life. This prevents the perfectionist spiral that kills most fasting attempts. When you stop fighting the system and start working with it, everything becomes easier.

**Reality Check:** Most people fail IF because they're following someone else's perfect protocol. This is IF for humans who have shit to do.

‚Ä¢	This story starts of with a kid and a lonesome dad‚Ä¶. As sans ran downstairs static for what was about to come, he ran and jumps on his dad's bed, Gaster. As his brother followed both him and Papyrus jumped on his bed while Sans yelled ‚ÄúITS MY BIRTHDAY,BIRTHDAY!‚Äù while Papyrus yelled ‚ÄúYAY,YAY‚Äù as Gaster said ‚ÄúÔÅ∑ÔÅ®ÔÅ°ÔÅ¥ÔÄ†ÔÅ©ÔÅ≥ÔÄ†ÔÅ¥ÔÅ®ÔÅ•ÔÄ†ÔÅ®ÔÅ•ÔÅ£ÔÅ´‚Äù as he rubbed his eye smiling he said ‚Äúokay okay, calm down both of you‚Äù as they both did he put his hands on their head chuckling while the other grabbed his coffee as he looked at sans he said ‚Äúhappy birthday Sans‚Äù as little Sans was smiling brightly as Sans say‚Äôs ‚Äúnow that i‚Äôm 10 I can finally go to the laboratory with you!‚Äù excitedly grabbing to Gasters coat whilst Papyrus on the other hand just followed along with his brother‚Äôs excitement as again Gaster chuckled he said ‚Äúwell yes but also‚Äù Sans looked confused a little worried he would avoid him from going but instead taking out a package as sans looked amazed Gaster said ‚Äúfirst a gift‚Äù as he opened it a small white coat written inside a little badge written ‚ÄòÔÅ≥ÔÅ°ÔÅÆÔÅ≥‚Äô his name as he just stared at it Gaster asked ‚Äúso? Do you like it?‚Äù as he got very big grin he said ‚ÄúI Love it!‚Äù as he put it on he hugged Gaster as Gaster smiled he said ‚Äúwell i‚Äôm happy you liked it but that‚Äôs not your only gift son‚Äù As Sans looked curious he asked ‚ÄúReally? Really what is it?‚Äù but as he got ready his hands floating about getting his coat and other things he said ‚ÄúWell will have to go to my work and check it out huh?‚Äù as sans went to get his own stuff Gaster kneeled down as he said ‚ÄúHey Pap since i‚Äôm going to the lab I‚Äôll leave you at Undying since you love to be at her house is that alright?‚Äù as Papyrus lit up he said ‚ÄúYES INDEED! YAYAY‚Äù he chuckled at Papyrus excitement it was endearing to say the least as the family all walked down Gaster leaving at Undying as he discussed a few things with her Papyrus and Sans were kicking their feet waiting as Papyrus asked‚ÄùSo your really going to the lab this time how exciting brother!‚Äù As sans smiled he responded with a simple ‚ÄúYeah it is!‚Äù but then Undying sighted as they both looked Undying said ‚ÄúCome on Papyrus i‚Äôll make you something what was your favourite again?‚Äù as he kinda screamed ‚ÄúSpaghetti!‚Äù as he walked in he waved goodbye to both Gaster and Sans as they walked Gaster said ‚ÄúHey wanna teleport there?‚Äù as Sans nodded Gaster held him and they disappeared they where at the lab together while Sans was chuckling since it was fun to teleport  as Gaster dropped him slowly down As he grabbed his little hand while his other hands opened the door out of nowhere Dr Alphy‚Äôs  (she is waaay younger btw) came out scrambling some papers as she was stressing a little Gaster waved as she realised she waved smiling saying ‚Äúoh Dr Gaster its so good to see you and sans‚Äù as Gaster smiled he said ‚Äúyes i‚Äôm showing him around to the lab as I promised‚Äù as she chuckled they chatted while sans explored looking around room by room while on the other hand Alphy‚Äôs and Gaster discussed ‚Äúi-I know y-you think it be a fun thing t-to show your kid around‚Ä¶.‚Äù But then Sans found a room, and, in this room, there was a flower a pot plant with petals as he looked at it, he wondered ‚Äòwhat a weird flower‚Ä¶.‚Äô As he poked at it, Hower snarled ‚Äúdo you mind it?‚Äù as Sans jumped back, he was smirking ‚Äúwhat the- the flower talks?‚Äù  As he looked at sans he said, ‚Äúoh look a twerp in walking about screw off kid!‚Äù but that just intrigued Sans ‚Äúwho are you?

Sorry if i‚Äôm‚Ä¶budding in‚Äù he chuckled to himself as Hower only looked more annoyed as he said ‚Äúoh so you think its funny well kid let me tell you one pun better and you can buzz off will ya?‚Äù as Sans heard this he chuckled harder but as he did Hower got a bright‚Ä¶devious idea‚Ä¶to get back at Alphys‚Ä¶and Gaster ‚Äúthat reminds me you must Gasters kid right?‚Äù as Sans stopped laughing he was a little curious as he said ‚Äúyeah‚Ä¶.why you ask?‚Äù as Hower smirked he said ‚Äúoh nothing I just heard him and Alphy talking about this secret gift they were hiding‚Äù as he looked curious was the flower lying or was there really a gift‚Ä¶.Gaster did tell him that he had another gift coming‚Ä¶so maybe just to be sure.. he asked ‚Äúand where would this so called secret gift be?‚Äù as Hower  smirked he said ‚Äúcome closer kid and i‚Äôll tell you‚Äù he came closer and whispered ‚Äúits in a place called the core its under a pillar so just go there and touch a button or to and it will appear‚Äù but then sans heard Gaster calling him and he said ‚Äúwell I got to leaf you soon‚Äù as the flower just rolled his eyes as Sans left but as he did Hower grinned Gaster saw Sans as he said ‚Äòwhat where you doing you curious scientist ?‚Äù in a s jokingly manner as Sans said ‚Äúoh I was just looking around‚Äù as Gaster chuckled they both walked. But it was to late‚Ä¶ as they arrived at the core room Gaster said, ‚Äúwe should probably skip this room-‚Äù but Sans ran in the room as Gaster‚Äôs widen as he said, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing!‚Äù as he ran, he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to find the gift Papa!‚Äù and as he claimed the little stool onto the button Alphy‚Äôs walked in seeing the horrific event happening trying to stop him but Gaster saw exactly what was going to happen s as Sans put his little hand in the button the machine started as he widens he asked ‚ÄúPapa?‚Äù He teleported between Sans and then in a second was standing there his body dusting slowly as Sans stared in horror he said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry child... ‚úãÔ∏é‚ùÑÔ∏é üïàÔ∏é‚úåÔ∏éüíßÔ∏é ‚ò†Ô∏é‚öêÔ∏é‚ùÑÔ∏é ‚ú°Ô∏é‚öêÔ∏éüïÜÔ∏é‚òºÔ∏é ‚òûÔ∏é‚úåÔ∏éüïÜÔ∏é‚òπÔ∏é‚ùÑÔ∏é‚Äù as he disappeared Sans breathed heavily holding what was once Gaster‚Äôs hand while the only background was Alphy‚Äôs cries.

‚Ä¢	10 years later from the incident he woke up breaving heavily it had been a memory of the day, but he wouldn‚Äôt let that make sense his day had been bad he had to help Papyrus do puzzles but in this world, it was a little different

For this world not just a pacifist in general its not even a run, since frisk didn‚Äôt land in check point it never started the game therefore Chara wasn‚Äôt a thing for no humans landed so Asrial, Torial and Asgore were still a family (Bit who is Hower you may be wondering? Simple Just a plant they put a random Monster in I might add lore to want if you want) and therefore frisk was just them no human or real life (player) controlling them in this au ‚Ä¢	frisk in fact didn‚Äôt even land in the ruins but landed in Snow-din instead, how? They lived with a family I know crazy a family, and they where building a new home or building and made a hole but accidentally made it deep enough and in top of Snow-din (Sans and Pap‚Äôs house) walked and fell down a hole as usual or something along the lines. And thus, she didn‚Äôt learn how to fight or level up or who the heck this flowey guy is, but instead she landed at the house of the infamous comedian, San‚Äôs of this timeline. And after a while she met Papyrus and most people in snow-din ( however she did not meet or know Tori or Undying ect till later when she tried leaving) in snow-din, now a town with a secret human who lived with the Skeleton brothers as one of their own.

‚Ä¢	But the peace couldn‚Äôt last forever, for soon enough Frisk wanted to go home‚Ä¶ she knew she didn‚Äôt fit in, everybody would watch her every-time she‚Äôd step foot out of the house, but neither Papyrus nor San‚Äôs wanted to explain since they feared she‚Äôd leave to break the barrier and risk her life in doing so or worse being corrupted as like all the humans.

‚Ä¢	In this Au, Sans had a good relationship with Gaster even calling him his father (as you may know from the into) even thought he knew he had no mother, but Gaster was killed by sand, and so Sans and knew that it was the right thing to do after all..But in this Au San‚Äôs couldn‚Äôt let go‚Ä¶while Papyrus and some of the residents kept him company Frisk understood him more then the other‚Äôs (and yes she liked his puns guys) so he tried avoiding questions and misleading them till they had enough‚Ä¶ and a heated argument arose‚Ä¶ between the lies and the painful truth, And San‚Äôs only wanting to keep them safe, acting as if they were leaving like Gaster leaving. But even he knew they where to far gone‚Ä¶so he let them leave‚Ä¶but they weren‚Äôt ready enough as they reached King Asgore in the fateful battle they had lost but before they could learn about resets, and it seemed like the end of a story, but then something unexpected happen. Her parents (yep frisk has parents in this Au) walked out from the barrier to the underground seeing there Child dead their mother held them in her hands while their father a mage (he is part of the mages at the beginning of the story, there‚Äôs also lore I want to write before and after the incident) was angry not only that but ‚Ä¶.furious his child who had been missing for weeks on end had been killed‚Ä¶so in his rage he used his determination and cursed the whole under-tale all of their souls trapped no longer able to die as they took frisk with them.

‚Ä¢	As Sans, sees and even witnesses everything he couldn‚Äôt do anything he banged his hand on the barrier tearing up and yelling his brother tried helping him but as he looked at Papyrus, he could see his soul chained a grim reminder of what had just occurred.  How everyone slowly and dreadfully around him were going mad over the years and even decades. They wanted the torture to stop and San‚Äôs would find a way, to help with Alphy‚Äôs trying to find a solution(since a human hadn't fallen ever since Frisk they couldn‚Äôt use determination except for the limited stock they had) the citizens started going mad and started scheming plotting ‚Äúthose bastard a it was their faults those bone monsters doomed us all to eternity‚Äù all hell lose which happened when they tried stealing one if the souls they had. Cannibalising, fighting or betraying each other in order to find ways to stop this madness‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢	And after a very long time and sleepless nights somehow  San‚Äôs and Alphy‚Äôs managed to find a solution to their problem with the use of a machine (haven‚Äôt decided design or name) able to liberate everyone‚Äôs souls, (notes where actually left by Gaster so W Gaster) but their was aways a catch a specially with this kind of tale,  the thing was the machine in order to operate needed one monster to liberate another..so it meant one monster had to be left behind Alphy‚Äôs offered but Sans denied feeling the guilt knowing that if he hadn‚Äôt been so protective and  taught Frisk how to fight maybe it would‚Äôve been different, a different outcome. So he volunteered so little to little he did it till it was just Sans and Papyrus the brother cried not wanting do die without his brother but Sans smirked he knew he wouldn‚Äôt allow himself to keep Papyrus from suffering much longer so in an act of love from brotherly hood (NOT OTHER LOVE, FAMILY LOVE) he unwilling shot Papyrus so he could be free and in the finale acts Papyrus say‚Äôs ‚ÄúI forgive, brother I will see you in the End‚Äù  and now the monster who was left was just him being stuck there his soul not able to die‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢	Alone... for a very long time in his empty Au... He would almost go mad multiple times trying to find a solution to a machine for himself but as he was in the middle of his discovery, he was suddenly was met by an unfamiliar face Core!frisk, as she introduced himself he pleadingly asked if she could use the machine and finish him at last, but as she tries to help the machine was only able to be used for people in his Au, (like the infinite stones in What if, if any nerds know you know) since her energy and his was different, so instead Core!frisk offered him another plan, taking him to the Omega timeline to live there.

‚Ä¢	As he was met with such a different environment Core!Frisk asked what his name was as he thought about it and as his brother wishes and also as a funny pun he said ‚ÄúName‚Äôs End, End the skeleton‚Äù as he spent his time living there he was met but many unfamiliar faces while trying to figure a way to break free of his chain. And in accident joining the good San‚Äôs helping the Au verse, blah blah you know Au stuff I wish would be a massive collab and in such mixing with other San‚Äôs Au‚Äôs story‚Äôs but although he had a happy and punful appearance deep down he missed all his loves ones and was deeply broken emotionally and physically, as a cup of water at the brim of spilling the events that leaded may or may not break him.

‚Ä¢	And after a very long time and sleepless nights somehow  San‚Äôs and Alphy‚Äôs managed to find a solution to their problem with the use of a machine (haven‚Äôt decided design or name) able to liberate everyone‚Äôs souls, (notes where actually left by Gaster so W Gaster) but their was aways a catch a specially with this kind of tale,  the thing was the machine in order to operate needed one monster to liberate another..so it meant one monster had to be left behind Alphy‚Äôs offered but Sans denied feeling the guilt knowing that if he hadn‚Äôt been so protective and  taught Frisk how to fight maybe it would‚Äôve been different, a different outcome. So he volunteered so little to little he did it till it was just Sans and Papyrus the brother cried not wanting do die without his brother but Sans smirked he knew he wouldn‚Äôt allow himself to keep Papyrus from suffering much longer so in an act of love from brotherly hood (NOT OTHER LOVE, FAMILY LOVE) he unwilling shot Papyrus so he could be free and in the finale acts Papyrus say‚Äôs ‚ÄúI forgive, brother I will see you in the End‚Äù  and now the monster who was left was just him being stuck there his soul not able to die‚Ä¶


‚Ä¢	Alone... for a very long time in his empty Au... He would almost go mad multiple times trying to find a solution to a machine for himself but as he was in the middle of his discovery, he was suddenly was met by an unfamiliar face Core!frisk, as she introduced himself he pleadingly asked if she could use the machine and finish him at last, but as she tries to help the machine was only able to be used for people in his Au, (like the infinite stones in What if, if any nerds know you know) since her energy and his was different, so instead Core!frisk offered him another plan, taking him to the Omega timeline to live there.


‚Ä¢	As he was met with such a different environment Core!Frisk asked what his name was as he thought about it and as his brother wishes and also as a funny pun he said ‚ÄúName‚Äôs End, End the skeleton‚Äù as he spent his time living there he was met but many unfamiliar faces while trying to figure a way to break free of his chain. And in accident joining the good San‚Äôs helping the Au verse, blah blah you know Au stuff I wish would be a massive collab and in such mixing with other San‚Äôs Au‚Äôs story‚Äôs but although he had a happy and punful appearance deep down he missed all his loves ones and was deeply broken emotionally and physically, as a cup of water at the brim of spilling the events that leaded may or may not break him.

The first featured a golden sauce with cured ham, offering richness, while the second pasta had a bright tomato-based sauce with seafood, giving a lively, savory depth.

1no85vy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1no85vy,Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate w/ coffee and Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet chocolate sans coffee,"Inspired by u/ashbakesstuff, I decided to make two chocolate sourdough loaves. One with dark chocolate chunks and a double-shot of espresso and another without coffee and semi-sweet chocolate chunks. While these loaves were nowhere near as beautiful as hers was, hot damn are they suuuuuuper yummy. I had initially screwed up (was in a rush to get my pup to her teeth appointment) and added equal parts flour and water to both doughs. Luckily when I returned to do my stretch and folds after an hour and thought ‚Äúboy these are way too wet,‚Äù it clicked and I worked in the remaining flour I needed to get the right consistency. Additionally, I avoided a cold ferment with this batch as I wanted to avoid too much sour flavor and let the chocolate shine through a little more. 

Recipe by u/ashbakesstuff who got it from @crustycravingsbyh on TikTok

Dark Chocolate w/ espresso:
- Bread Flour: 600g
- Cocoa Powder: 50g
- Double-shot Espresso: 90g 
- Water (warm): 350g 
- Active Starter: 100g 
- Brown Sugar: 30g
- Salt: 10g
- Vanilla Extract: 5g
- Ghirardelli Dark-Chocolate: 115g (the whole bar)

Semi-sweet Chocolate:
- Bread Flour: 500g
- Cocoa Powder: 50g
- Water (warm): 350g 
- Active Starter: 100g 
- Brown Sugar: 30g
- Salt: 10g
- Vanilla Extract: 5g
- Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks: 115g (the whole bar)

Mix the starter and warm water. Then add the rest of the ingredients except the chocolate chunks. Let the shaggy dough sit for 1 hour. Then stretch and fold every 30 minutes for the next 2 hours, adding the dark chocolate chunks to the espresso loaf and the semi-sweet to the other during the second set of stretch and folds. After the final fold, allow dough to finish bulk fermentation. Shape dough into desired shape, allow it to rest for 30 minutes. Preheat oven(s) to 450 with pan/dutch oven inside. After 30 minutes are up and the ovens heated, shape each dough one final time before scoring and pop them into the oven for 30 minutes. If you do a loaf pan, I like to add another loaf pan on top to enclose the loaf. After 30 minutes, remove the lid/top pan, lower oven temp to 400f and bake for another 10-13 minutes. 

Needless to say, I will absolutely be doing this again down the road. Each slice, toasted and topped with peanut butter has been delicious. I am very excited to try this with my coffee in the morning. Thank you again to u/ashbakesstuff for this recipe! ",4,1758602124.0,Breadit,0,1.0,False

Sorry this is long 
I 31 female have been with my husband male 32 for almost 15 years. We haven‚Äôt been in a good place for years. I‚Äôm not in love with him but I do love him. He is/was my best friend who I thought I‚Äôd be with forever and that he would never do anything to hurt me. Until today I‚Äôm broken and shattered and I don‚Äôt know what I should do.  My trust for him is gone and I don‚Äôt know if I will be able to get it back. Back in March I felt a shift in our relationship. He was more distant and on his phone a lot more. I just pushed it to the side and tried to ignore it. But I kept getting this gut feeling he was up to something. I ignored it for a while but it just made me question why he was also on his phone. He would never leave it laying around anymore and he would stay up much later than me at night ( which was unusual for him bc he usually wakes up at 4 in the morning) but my gut was telling me something was up. I knew he would never let his phone out of his sight. So I figured I‚Äôd just take his iPad and try to figure it out. Well this man was clever bc the iPad he never used and always left on his desk all of a sudden stayed in his possession. So I knew it would be hard for me to figure out. So for months I tried looking over his shoulder, cuddling super close to see who he was texting tried staying up later than him but nothing. He would just always make it to where I couldn‚Äôt see. So for months I had a gut feeling that he was talking to someone else but I had no way to find out. I would make jokes of him always texting his girlfriend and he would get angry and tell me I was crazy.  Well today after I dropped our son off at school I came home was making me a coffee when something kept nagging me to find his iPad. I searched for about 10 minutes and I found it. It was slightly hidden but I‚Äôm pretty sure he forgot to take it with him so I start searching going through messages, Instagram, Facebook other apps he has to communicate I searched for an hour trying to find something bc I knew something was there. I almost gave up until something told me to open up a app called discord ( had no clue what that was honestly thought it was some gaming app) so I started clicking on messages and there‚Äôs a few of him talking crap about me. But whatever I know I‚Äôm not perfect. Then I came across a conversation with him and another woman. These messages went on for 7 almost 8 months. He was telling this women so many lies about his life and what he has to do everyday. He would go on and on about how he cared so much for her and how she was an angel and how he grew love for her. For 7 almost 8 months this man who I shared a bed with would wake up every morning message this lady good morning then kiss me tell me his loves me before he left for work. Then all day have conversation with this lady come home kiss me tell me how much he missed me throughout the day and continue messaging this lady until he told her goodnight and then would cuddle and fuck me as if he was in love with me.  It took me over 8 hours to read all those messages between him and her and I was hurt but honestly I wasn‚Äôt mad,sad or angry I honestly thought to myself this is my get out of jail free card. I can finally get away until I realized it would be hard for me to get away. He would find a way for it to be my fault and if I made him leave then he would let me know he wouldn‚Äôt be here tomorrow. How do I let the person I‚Äôve been with for 15 years leave knowing that if he can‚Äôt have me then he wouldn‚Äôt be here tomorrow. I can‚Äôt let our son be without a father and I can‚Äôt live with myself knowing that my husband would hurt himself if he left.

I don‚Äôt know how to handle or manage anything financially bc he handled all of that. I‚Äôm not sad that he decided to have an emotional affair with a woman he didn‚Äôt know who lived across the country from us. I‚Äôm hurt that the one person who I trusted with my life did this to me.

**A mouse.** Not just any mouse. A *creature of the shadows*, a *demonic blur of fur and terror*, *hurtling across the curtains* like a villain in the final act of a thriller. My breath caught. My soul *left* my body for a brief, chilling second.

It scampered ‚Äî bold, arrogant ‚Äî across the kitchen shelf‚Ä¶ toward a lone, forgotten sticky trap. And in that moment, a switch flipped within me. I was no longer a teenager. I was a **warrior**.

With the raw instinct of a seasoned gladiator and the desperation of someone who had *just barely passed biology*, I **slammed** the coffee maker in front of the trap ‚Äî a *perfect* move, a *stroke of genius*, a *divine strike*.

The mouse panicked. It made a fatal move.

**It landed.** Right on the trap. Victory.

But victory‚Ä¶ oh, she‚Äôs a cruel mistress.

My triumph evaporated as the reality of the situation hit me like a Greek tragedy. I began spinning in frantic circles, hyperventilating, praying to gods I had never before acknowledged, while tearing through drawers and closets in search of gloves. Just **one** glove. The glove of fate. The glove of battle.

Then, I called upon my grandmother ‚Äî the matriarch, the elder, the only one who knew what to do in times like this. As I rolled up my pants like I was preparing for war in the rice fields of feudal Japan (which helped *absolutely nothing*, by the way), chaos erupted.

In trying to retrieve the coffee machine‚Ä¶ I knocked something loose. It **fell**. On the trap. On the mouse. Towards me.

**My grandmother**, goddess of calm chaos, pulled it in my direction ‚Äî and like a startled feline confronted with a cucumber, **I leapt back**, shrieking in a pitch previously unknown to the human species.

I *crashed* into the trash can, *launched* a sandal across the kitchen like a missile, *shouldered the refrigerator* like I was reenacting a WWE finale, and scraped my arm with all the grace of a falling chandelier.

And then, dear listener‚Ä¶ I **screamed**. Not just screamed. I *screamed like the gates of hell had opened and I was the first to be taken.*

And yet, I prevailed.

I attached the sticky trap ‚Äî my tormentor ‚Äî to the end of a broom like it was a cursed relic and marched it outside like a knight banishing a dark spirit. I peeled it off, placed a cardboard box over it like a tombstone, and did what had to be done.

**A paint can.**

Heavy. Full. Final.

With trembling hands and a soul forever changed, I struck. Once. Twice. Three‚Ä¶ maybe four times. Until the beast was as flat and lifeless as a pressed autumn leaf in a forgotten diary.

1no7z1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1no7z1t/what_should_i_do_about_a_coworker_who_seems_to/,What should I do about a coworker who seems to have a weird vendetta against me?,"I (23F) recently, started a job as an assistant in an office building. My company itself is small, but we work in a larger office building with a lot of other people, and there‚Äôs one guy who comes in every day to do the cleaning that‚Äôs about my age. This post is about him.

At first, I thought I was being paranoid because I noticed he was skipping my trashcan when he came in to empty everyone‚Äôs. I even moved my trash right into the walkway a few times right in front of him so it was impossible to miss, and he still ignored it. I kind of brushed it off and thought I was overreacting. Then one day I went to the bathroom while he was replacing the trash and when I came back, I was locked out of the office with all my coworkers still inside. Which means I think he just locked me out of the office on purpose. At the time, I also kind of brushed it off and assumed it was maybe an accident.

Then, last week, one of my coworkers casually asked if he had been taking my trash out. When I said no, she told me this cleaner guy hated the last girl in my position because she rinsed the coffee pot and filter in the office sink. She said he probably hates everybody who works my job because they all have to rinse the coffee pot out, so now he probably hates me too.

For background: our break room doesn‚Äôt have a sink, and I was specifically instructed as part of my job to rinse out the coffee pot and filter in the little supply room sink. It‚Äôs just a small sink in a closet area that‚Äôs open to everyone in the office, but there‚Äôs another door and I think it leads into a cleaning room where the cleaning guy hangs out. So it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm doing anything wrong I was told to do this.

My coworker was joking about it, and my boss ended up coming up and she told him that the cleaner hated me now too but he basically just shrugged off. 

Honestly, the whole situation makes me feel pretty uncomfortable. First of all I just started this job and it already feels like I‚Äôm being dragged into some random office beef that has nothing to do with me really. Second, it keeps getting brought up every day whenever he skips my trash, people are making it a joke, but it kind of makes me feel weird.

The fact that it‚Äôs only me he‚Äôs doing this to, plus the locked out incident, feels weirdly aggressive. It makes me anxious to go into work and interact with him, especially since he still skips my trash and has access to my desk when I‚Äôm not there and also knows the women‚Äôs restroom codes.

The problem is, there‚Äôs no HR here. It‚Äôs literally just two partners who are I guess both my bosses. And my main boss already shrugged it off and admitted that he knew this was an issue with the last assistant too, so I‚Äôm not sure how seriously he‚Äôll take it if I bring it up again. I don‚Äôt know if I should: talk to him again directly, write a formal email so there‚Äôs a record, try to get in touch with the building managers, or just leave it alone. But honestly, it makes me feel uncomfortable and if I dare say a little unsafe, so I feel like I should do something.

I‚Äôm pretty new to game dev, and I‚Äôve been playing games like¬†***Good Pizza, Great Pizza***¬†**and**¬†***Good Coffee, Great Coffee***. They look simple on the surface, but I‚Äôm sure there are some cool algorithms working behind the scenes, and I'm curious what those might be.

I'm curious about stuff like how they decide what orders customers will ask for. Or how the game checks if you made the order ""right"" or ""wrong"".

I'm completely new to game development, and I don't have much experience with algorithms, so if anyone could explain it in beginner-friendly terms, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Thank you!",1,1758601320.0,hobbygamedev,1,1.0,False

I chose to disclose my diagnosis to my manager, their manager (who used to be my direct manager and was the person who hired me in my first role in the business), and to HR.  Manager and manager once removed both have neurodivergent kids.  Manager once removed took me out for coffee and reiterated that there‚Äôs no doubting my work ethic and that they want to find the best way to capitalise on my focus and talents.  Manager made a comment insinuating that I disclosed to HR so I wouldn‚Äôt get in trouble, and at our last one-on-one seized on a mistake I‚Äôd made (and immediately owned, and remediated, and safeguarded against happening again, and already discussed with them ad infinitum), asking if it was down to ADHD and that they hadn‚Äôt yet ‚Äúcracked the code of how to manage me‚Äù.  Because, of course, if I‚Äôm going to make a mistake, it must be down to neurology, and not, y‚Äôknow, human nature, or having a bad day.

And that, friends, is why I disclosed to HR.  So I have some recourse against petty types who likely think I should have grown out of ADHD, like they‚Äôre expecting their kid to do.",2,1758601260.0,adhdaustralia,1,1.0,False
1no7wi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScrollAddiction/comments/1no7wi0/7_sciencebacked_tips_to_break_your_scroll/,7 Science-Backed Tips to Break Your Scroll Addiction,"# 1. Replace, Don't Restrict

Instead of trying to ""just stop,"" plan specific activities for your usual scroll times. When you feel the urge to scroll, have a book ready, call a friend, or take a walk. Your brain needs something to do, not nothing to do.

# 2. Remove the Trigger

Put your phone in another room during focus time. The few seconds it takes to retrieve it gives your brain time to remember why you're avoiding it. Physical distance creates mental distance.

# 3. Set Scroll Schedules

Allow yourself 30 minutes of scrolling after coffee and 30 minutes after work. Having planned scroll time removes the guilt and makes it easier to stop when time's up.

# 4. Turn Off All Notifications

Every ping is a dopamine trap designed to pull you back in. Turn off notifications for social apps. If it's truly urgent, people will call or text.

# 5. Create ""Phone-Free Zones""

Designate specific areas where phones aren't allowed - your bedroom, dining table, or workspace. Physical boundaries help create mental boundaries and reduce the automatic reach for your device.

# 6. Add Friction with Intentional Delays

Use apps like One Sec or create your own friction by requiring yourself to wait 10 seconds before opening social apps. This brief pause interrupts the automatic habit and gives your conscious mind a chance to decide if you really want to scroll right now.

# 7. Track Your Wins, Not Your Failures

Celebrate every time you choose something real over scrolling. ""I read for 20 minutes instead of scrolling"" beats ""I only scrolled for 2 hours today."" Focus on what you're gaining, not what you're losing.

What worked best for you? And what's your biggest struggle with breaking the scroll habit?",9,1758601244.0,ScrollAddiction,0,1.0,False
