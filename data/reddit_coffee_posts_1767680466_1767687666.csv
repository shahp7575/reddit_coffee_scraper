1q5czad,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1q5czad/daily_eye_twitching_for_1_year_now_noticed_on/,"Daily eye twitching for ~1 year, now noticed on exam and referred to ophthalmology. What could cause this?","Hi, I’m hoping to get some insight while I wait for an ophthalmology appointment.


Age: 22


Sex: F


Height/Weight: 5’8” and ~130-135 pounds (or ~60kg) 


Medical conditions: POTS, GERD (seeing genetics for an unrelated issue)


Drinking/smoking/drugs: none


Caffeine: not on a regular basis - I have a cup of coffee once in a blue moon 


Sleep: good and consistent, usually 8-9 hours of sleep per night 


Deficiencies: none that I know of (no iron, magnesium, B12, etc.)


For about a year now, I’ve had eye twitching almost every day. It’s usually my eyelids, but sometimes it feels like the area just under my eyes too. It’s not painful, just annoying, and I honestly hadn’t thought much of it tbh. 


Today I had an appointment with a geneticist for something completely unrelated, and she did a full physical and neuro style exam. When she did the eye exam (the small light and following it in all directions), she spent quite a long time watching my eyes. She also had me smile really big and noticed that my eyelids and the area below my eyes were twitching during that as well.


Because of that, she’s referring me to an ophthalmologist, and said it should be a quick referral (this week). That part is what’s making me anxious I think. 


My questions:


What could cause persistent daily eye/facial twitching like this?


Does this sound more like something benign or something that warrants concern?


Is an urgent ophthalmology referral typically precautionary in cases like this?


I know no one can diagnose me online; I’m just trying to understand what kinds of things doctors usually consider so I can calm my nerves a bit while I wait. Thanks so much.",1,1767687566.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Why I’m building a [wearable health device](https://sychedelic.com/blogs/the-future-of-wearable-tech-from-fitness-tracking-to-brain-boosting/) company that treats the brain, not just the body.

In a world obsessed with tracking steps and calories, we’ve ignored the most critical organ in the empire: The Human Brain.

As a founder and a mom, I’ve seen the ""forbidden"" truth your mental performance isn't about how much coffee you drink; it’s about how well you manage your cognition. We’ve been taught to survive the ""crap"" life throws at us, but we’ve never had the tools to actually understand your brain in real-time.

**Until now.**

We are building the future of health devices. We aren’t just another tracker; we are a HealthTech revolution focused on neuromodulation and brain health tracking.

**The Sychedelic Mission:**

\- Decoding the Human Brain: We’re moving past guesswork. Our tech is about decoding the human brain to help you understand your stress levels before they lead to a burnout.

\-Beyond Survival: Most wearables tell you that you’re tired. We use neuromodulation to help you shift your state, optimizing cognitive health in just 20 minutes.

\- The Longevity Play: This isn't just about winning the afternoon; it’s about long-term brain health. We are prioritizing longevity so your brain stays as sharp as your ambition.

The future of health devices belongs to those who prioritize cognitive health as much as physical fitness. Whether you're navigating a boardroom or a 3 AM ""poonami,"" you deserve a device that helps you [\#GetSyched](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/getsyched/).

I’m a Prayagraj local who has recently left his full time job in London, and have moved backed here to help with my family business. 

While I was in the UK, I got used to a certain standard of gaming cafes, high-end specs, super clean aesthetics, and a proper community vibe. Since coming back, I’ve been looking for a spot to grind Dota 2 or play CS2, but I’m struggling to find a dedicated PC LAN center here. Most places seem to be just general browsing cafes.

I am seriously considering putting up the capital to open a proper Esports Cafe in Civil Lines.
I want to bring that International/Tier 1 Indian city gaming bar/cafe culture to Allahabad.

The Rigs: 144Hz+ monitors, Mechanical keyboards, Zowie/Logitech mice. No compromise on FPS for CS2/Valo.

The Vibe: Not a dark, dingy basement. I’m thinking modern industrial decor, comfortable ergonomic chairs, and genuinely good coffee/food and (ofcource Maggi).

Community: Weekend LAN tournaments, TI/Major watch parties, and a chill place to hang out even if you aren't playing.

My Question to You: I know the passion for gaming is here, but I’m unsure about the economics in Prayagraj right now.

Willingness to Pay: For a premium experience (AC, zero lag, high-end gear, clean restrooms), what is a realistic hourly rate people would pay here?

The Crowd: Are people still playing CS and Dota here, or has everyone moved fully to Valo/BGMI on mobile?

I want to create something high-quality for the city, but I need to know if the market is ready for it.

Poll: If I open this place, what is the MAX hourly rate you'd comfortably pay?

More cloudy and grey.
Yet the rain never falls.
No flood flushes the roads.

It's been dim.
Dim enough that breakfast looked like dinner.

So people don't get breakfast.
They just drink.
Cup of milk, of coffee, of rum, or some fabrication of an idealistic breakfast.

Notes has been a popular choice for breakfast these days.
Buy one and it'll say something nice to you and for you to work on like copper.

“Your hair looks nice this morning!”
“It wouldn't be your job without you!”
“Don't forget lunch! Wouldn't want anything to steal that waist of yours!”

“Only you know how much love you deserve, so give them to yourself!”

It always fascinates me— that saying to love thyself.
Repeated through countless generations, through countless kingdoms and their wars, through continents and stars.

Yet not a single one tells how to do so.
Always speaking through a thin wire to tread outside of specificity.

They say a love language exists.
So what should I use to love myself?
My own language? or another language so I'm able to portray the use of my love language?

Would touch need me to sever my own hands before cupping my own cheeks?
Would words need me to rip my own throat and blow air to make voices?

Love thyself.
Then immediately countered by saying that people have different ways to love.

So what must it be?
I'm my own language, must I twist into another person to love myself?
Or must I turn myself into another person so I may love it?

No, no, that's not it, sweetheart.
To love yourself means to love what's good and what's bad about you.

So we are praising faults?
Wouldn't it be pretentious? To love a part that's mildly decent, and also worship the worst of himself?

Love is acceptance, it doesn't have to be beautiful or grand.
Just noticing and acknowledging that part of you exists is all.

Then isn't that just a world where nothing ever gets done?
Left and right, people have to say “I accept your incompetence field.”

Every journey to self love says the same.
Protect your peace, you are your own happiness, your thoughts aren't you.

So by that logic, there are still two people to love one.
The other to give, protect, and reject.
The other to feel and be happy.

There's no true self love.
You cannot be a self, and love that.

It's either alienation of one element of what makes the self.
Or an invitation to another so the self may be a self.

The only greatest true self love is to destroy one.
To make the previous self a new view for those coming to love.

The greatest act of self kindness is self mutilation.
To scrape the scarlet rot and make a garden of it.

The blind love themselves with acceptance due to inaction.
The lovers love themselves with destruction because they wouldn't love themselves in a state of deluded poppy.",1,1767686810.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1q5cqbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ControversialOpinions/comments/1q5cqbw/plant_based_milk_and_cheese_companies_are_not/,Plant based milk and cheese companies are not tricking unwitting consumers,"Many places like the EU and Canada have rules preventing plant based milks and cheeses from being called milks and cheeses or using terms which dairy claims. 

A common argument why these companies cannot label their milks and cheeses as milks and cheeses is that this protects the consumer from being tricked. This is ag industry propaganda and any risk of tricking happens the other way. 

Plant based milks and cheeses are currently significantly more expensive than plant based ones for reasons including being a less developed technology and not getting dairy subsidies. Oatly and presumably other plant based milk companies report negative operating margins. An FDA report that looked into the tricking concern in 2023 determined that consumers generally understand that these do not contain dairy milk and pick them partly for that reason. 

There is little incentive for oatly or its peers to trick customers by pretending to be dairy milk. Their customer base seeks them out because it is non-dairy milk and they would compete against cheaper products and reduce their own differentiation against them. 

Everywhere except for packaging, people use the terms without much confusion. People have referred to plant based milks as milks for thousands of years and today people would look at me weird if I asked for soy beverage in my coffee instead of asking for soy milk.

The harm of this is that consumers who want to consider other options to compare prices or nutrition may need to know the non standardized names of the brands before hand hurting product discovery. Advocates of these naming rules will bring up nutrition concerns while reducing the ability to compare nutrition by making sure the substitutes are of different product cateogories. 

To whatever extent trickery happens, it is by the dairy side. Products like lactose free dairy milk or products that contain dairy milk often don’t clearly label themselves as dairy products. If proponents of this clear labeling were honest about their intent, they would have at least handled the lactose free milks that don’t have a clear dairy label on them as the average person will not understand the lactose free dairy milk technology. I think it’s far more likely that consumers looking for plant based options end up tricked into lactose free dairy than that consumers looking for dairy end up with a plant based milk . 

The dairy industry isn’t satisfied with relying on our subsidies for their business model but also has successfully weaponized the perception of consumer incompetence to keep out competition.",3,1767686611.0,ControversialOpinions,0,1.0,False

I often see Mums in what seems to be an agreed uniform of coats. You know, black kenee lemgth, neck covered and looking super toasty.

Im pregnant and will soon be back into the newborn long coffee walks so keen to get something suitable.

Obviously I can just find a generic one anywhere but wondered if there is anything specifically suitable?

Edit: I'm not looking for a pregnancy / maternity coat. More for after!

I’ve noticed over the past few months that many people in this community often share posts about friendships, going for coffee, and random chats. While these interactions can lead to positive connections, they sometimes expose us to scammers and individuals who are not genuine. Many of you have already created groups for networking, but I am seeking to establish a strong sports community for young individuals who are busy with their hectic routines. Our goal is not just to gather and play sports, but also to discuss healthy ideas, technology, and foster a strong network. If you enjoy playing sports and haven’t participated in a while for any reason, or if you are a sports enthusiast, let’s build a solid community together. Please note: There will be no tolerance for vulgar conversations or troublemakers in this community.

I met her! We got along well enough, nothing accusatory was said, and the feedback was that we actually liked each other. That didn't last. The following morning she found my contact info somewhere (not from him or me) and sent me an email saying ""suck it up buttercup,"" that if I cared for him I'd let him keep her as just a friend. Yeah, sure.

So I've decided to do exactly that... Ignore them and whatever they do.

He is very talkative, and one day replies to an Instagram story of mine. 

We start chatting about our interests and random stuff, and I continue to ask follow-up questions and add on to things he said, because that’s how conversations work, and that’s how you be nice, right?

(Also please note I am neurodivergent and often have a difficult time understanding social cues, intentions, etc)

I was back in my hometown for Christmas when this started. He asked me if I was currently in the city (of the university) as it was very boring there. I told him I was not. When I did move back to the city a week later, he told me that he’d like to get coffee with me before he leaves back to his home country in three days. 

I said sure, bc in my mind this couldn’t be a date if he’s leaving right away, right?? Meeting up simply as friends/peers would be good to me.

HOWEVER, upon discussing what time would work, he replied with “I can do in the afternoon ;)” and then TWO more messages with “ ;) ” and “ ;> “ at the end. He also hearted over half the messages I sent. 

Does the winking face “ ;) “ always necessarily mean flirtatious? Or can it just be friendly? But even if it was, it’s not like a date would make sense, as he’s moving to the other side of the world right away anyways. Unless “ ;) “ implies something else?? Is it possible that it IS in fact flirty, but since a relationship obviously wouldn’t happen in the time frame, it’s in an “I want something physical from you” way?? And if so, did I possibly accidentally reciprocate that idea??

1q5clwp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q5clwp,Help with progressively worsening coffee plant,"Hey
I posted about a week ago asking for help for my coffee plant and some reminded me that she needed high humidity and less intense light
So I bought a humidifier and keep her about 2 inches from it humidifier blows upward not at her and is on for about 14 hours daily 

As for watering I’m watering at about a week apart or so as her soil isn’t dry enough usually hence the moisture meter. 

I also bought a moisture meter to accurately check when she’s dry

I also moved her to a south facing window that has shutters but I point the shutters upward so light shouldn’t hit her directly 

As for the grow light I moved it far from the plant and lowered the intensity and it is primarily aimed at plants surrounding her so it’s not directed at her 

I thought she was doing better since she was very upright but the brown spots I had noticed are getting worse and I’m very worried 

I’m not sure what to do and I adore this freaking plant to death

If additional context is needed she is currently in fox farms soil with added perlite I haven’t added any fertilizer as I’ve heard that may be harmful since she is fragile. I live in a desert area so naturally the air is quite dry and especially since it is winter 

Any advice or help is greatly appreciated:(

For reference this was her leaves about a week ago (first picture) and these are her leaves now (second picture) I fear the left upper leaf is a goner :(

I have also attached a photo of her current set up (3rd picture) 

As for the rest of her she seems pretty upright and I think a small bud is forming here (4th picture) and her bud hasn’t changed much but seems okay (5th picture)

At Thanksgiving Dinner, I was taking a picture of the over-priced gazebo my in-laws recently built to send to my friend with an eye-roll emoji, and guess what my iPhone immortalized in digital format?

My husband was ki-ssing Diana. Talk about things not to be thankful for.

I let out a dry laugh, which burned my insides. It hurt like a motherfu-cker.

Then I printed ten photographs of the ki-ss and put them into the envelope.

I picked up the red and green acrylic pens I'd set aside for just this purpose and, with the viciousness of a woman scorned, wrote my husband's name and mine on it.

To Aiden. From Mia.

Then I contacted my friend, a divorce lawyer.

Heartbreak changes you—I would've never known, would never have believed it until it happened to me.

I'm not mercenary by nature. But I've been pushed to a point where I'm going to choose me, since my husband, the love of my life, doesn't give a rat's a-ss about me.

Now he could choke on it.

——————

Mia

My last name might be Winter, but Aiden Winter and his parents, his sister, his brother, his...well, all his family, look at me and treat me like I'm just taking up space, the same exact space they'd rather fill with their favorite family friend—a woman who is probably fertile, considering I am not.

I'd have never asked for a divorce, no matter how bad things got, except....

I love my husband. I thought I knew he loved me.

But that changed when I saw him ki-ss another woman.

Oh, he backed away immediately, had a whole, 'what have I done' look on his face, but the genie was out of the fu-cking bottle.

""So, this is what it takes?"" my best friend asks, as she gives me a measured look.

Katya isn't a fan of Aiden or his family. She sees them as snobs who think that if your bank account doesn't have a zillion zeroes, then you aren't worthy of their time. She also sees Aiden as their enabler.

""They'd invite Ted Bundy over and treat him better than they do you if he came from money,"" she once quipped.

""Not just money,"" I corrected her, slurring my words because we'd finished a whole bottle of wine between us, ""it has to be old money.""

""You sure this is how you want to do this?"" she asks me, again, as she slides the divorce papers into a manila envelope.

We're sitting at her dining table in her cute cottage just outside of Burlington. It has three bedrooms. I'll be residing in one of them shortly, right after Christmas.

Katya and I grew up together.

When my parents died in an accident, her parents took me in. I was sixteen. I miss my parents every day, but Anya and Ivan made me their daughter in every way. So, Katya, in fact, is both my sister and best friend.

Losing Ivan three years ago was harder than when I lost my parents.

Anya now lives in an a-ssisted living facility, a couple of hours from Burlington. Katya tried taking care of her, but early-onset dementia isn't something that can be managed at home.

It's progressive and heartbreaking.

Sometimes, Anya is lucid, but most of the time, she isn't.

Katya and I mourn the woman she was before the disease took over—and try to be grateful that she's still with us, that there are moments where she knows us, when she reaches for Katya or me, and remembers our names. And then it's gone, like the tide pulling back before we can even feel the wave.

Katya and I used to visit Anya once a week, though now she mostly goes on her own. I have not been able to accompany her regularly. She understands that I have social responsibilities since I'm a Winter.

I can still hear Aiden say, ""She's not even your mother. I don't understand why you have to go. This charity lunch is important to my parents, Mia.""

I didn't argue. I stayed back.

I was weak and pathetic, so afraid to lose him that I just let go of myself.

No more!

""Yes, I'm sure. But use this."" I pull out an envelope from my tote. It's gorgeous and golden—one Aiden gave me two Christmases ago with a card in, a card that simply said: 'Paris Vacation'.

We still haven't gone.

My husband is the CEO of Winter Financial, a hedge fund company that manages gazillions of dollars. His father, Nelson, is Chairman of the Board. He's a piece of work, by which I mean a complete misogynist and a-sshole.

""The one thing you should be able to do, which is get knocked up, and you can't do that. Why the fu-ck is he still married to you?"" he once said to me.

I'd then said it was because he loved me.

What the fu-ck did I know?

I'm a kindergarten teacher; I don't usually swear. But since that ki-ss, something has been unraveling inside of me.

""Oh, and don't forget to add this."" I hand her ten printed photographs of the ki-ss. For each print, I used a different filter. The noir one looks particularly romantic.

Yes, I took a photo.

No, it wasn't intentional.

It was by accident.

I'd needed to breathe, so I had left the family house while pie was being served at Thanksgiving Dinner.

I was taking a picture of the over-priced gazebo my in-laws recently built to send to Katya with an eye-roll emoji, and guess what my iPhone immortalized in digital format?

Yep, you guessed it!

My husband was ki-ssing her.

Talk about things not to be thankful for.

Katya snickers. ""This is truly diabolical. I never thought you'd do it.""

""I never did, either,"" I admit.

Her expression softens with compa-ssion. ""How hard is this?""

I let out a dry laugh, which burns my insides. ""It hurts like a motherfu-cker.""

""You keep up with that language, and they'll kick you out of Little Luminaries,"" she teases, but her voice is gentle. She knows how much I love Aiden. Knows that this is painful. Knows that I feel lost and afraid.

""Then you can hire me at your firm.""

Katya is a divorce lawyer. And right now, it is conveniently handy.

Every woman whose husband cheats on her should have a divorce lawyer as a best friend.

""And you're sure you don't want to talk to him and get his side of the story?"" She gives me the sealed envelope.

""He ki-ssed her. That's the end of the story, babe.""

I pick up the red and green acrylic pens I'd set aside for just this purpose and, with the viciousness of a woman scorned, write my husband's name and mine on it.

To Aiden. From Mia.

I add some sketches of holly and sh-it—so it looks Christma-ssy.

""Mia, I am so sorry."" Katya puts a hand on my shoulder.

I hold her gaze, my eyes dry. I'd cried myself dry for three weeks now, and I didn't have anything left.

""I'm not.""

She tilts her head and gives me a look that says, ""I don't believe you, babe. But A+ for faking it.""

I shake my head as I set the acrylic pens on Katya's desk. ""I've put up with enough.""

""I know that.""

""Years of doing everything I can to make his family accept me, make him happy, and what do I get in return? I get to photograph him ki-ssing Diana fu-cking Valentine.""

""I've never heard you cuss this much,"" Katya notes.

""Well, Miss Goody Two-Shoes is done being good.""

Heartbreak changes you—I would've never known, would never have believed it until it happened to me.

I take a cleansing breath. ""Now, let's walk through that blasted prenuptial agreement.""

I'm not mercenary by nature. But I've been pushed to a point where I'm going to choose me, since my husband, the love of my life, doesn't give a rat's a-ss about me.

And, let's face it, the Winters have it coming. After all, they were the ones who'd put the infidelity clause in that prenup; certain a harlot like me would be the one who'd stray.

Now they can choke on it.

As the heroine in William Congreve's 1697 play, The Mourning Bride, declared, ""Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor he-ll a fury like a woman scorned.""

Aiden

""Baby, you haven't eaten anything.""

I looked at Mia's plate, barely touched. She'd cooked dinner like she always does—fish and rice, and vegetables.

She opened a bottle of dry Riesling to go with it. She'd drunk two gla-sses. One more than usual.

She looks small, lost, and guilt swarms through me.

That ki-ss!

God! How could I have done that to my marriage? To myself?

The only saving grace is that it was one ki-ss, and Mia didn't know. I can't stand the idea of her finding out. She'll break.

My wife loves me. Completely.

My family doesn't see it.

""Not hungry,"" she says, her eyes staring into the distance.

""You packed?"" I ask because she's not looking at me, and I'm trying to extend the conversation so she will.

Now, she does. But there's a faraway look on her face. I've never seen it before. She seems detached. ""I packed.""

We leave for Stowe, Vermont, tomorrow for the Winter Christmas week, as we always do.

Bliss—the estate that has been in the Winter family for several generations—is a forty-minute drive from Burlington. There are several cabins around the estate and one large house, my parents', where we stay and spend most of our time during this week, eating, drinking, and being a family.

""Skis?"" I ask.

""Of course.""

I nod and press my lips. ""Are you alright?""

""Why wouldn't I be?"" She looks confused enough that I wonder if I'm transferring my guilt onto her.

I feel like sh-it.

Diana and I grew up together.

Her parents were close friends of mine. When they pa-ssed when we were in our twenties, we enfolded her into our family. She got married and lived in Los Angeles, but after her divorce, she returned and has become a fixture.

She's close to my sister and sister-in-law. She goes on spa days with my mother. My father adores her. She works at Winter Financial as the Chief Financial Officer. We spend a lot of time together at work.

My colleagues joke and call her my 'work wife'.

When I ask my a-ssistant to let my wife know I'll be late, she teases and asks me which one. It's usually Mia who has to hear from my a-ssistant.

I don't love Diana. Not like I love Mia. However, over the past two years, since Diana returned to Vermont and started working for me, I have been to more restaurants with Diana and had more meals with her than with my wife.

""Be careful,"" Huxley, my oldest and closest friend, warned me when we met a few months ago for drinks.

He owns a chain of hotels across the state. We met in high school and have been close since.

""What do you mean?"" I asked, perturbed.

""You're planning a business trip and missing your wedding anniversary.""

""And?""

""And...you're taking a business trip with Diana to Paris.""

I shook my head. ""What the fu-ck are you trying to say?""

""I'm not trying, Aiden, I'm telling you that you're having a fu-cking affair and you're going to lose your wife over it.""

I laughed. Hard. ""I'm not having an affair. Diana is family, Hux. We're colleagues and⁠—""

""You're having an emotional affair. Your colleagues call her your work wife.""

I waved a dismissive hand. ""Everyone has a work wife. Means nothing.""

""How does Mia feel about her?""

""My wife isn't insecure,"" I snapped.

""She's not happy about all the time you spend with Diana. I can guarantee that, even if she hasn't said a thing.""

It's not like she hadn't, but she understands that work is work, and Diana is family. She brought it up a lot when Diana first moved back to Vermont, but I shut it down by telling her to grow a spine and trust me.

""You don't know Mia, so stop pretending like you do.""

""But I know Diana,"" he pointed out. He did. We all grew up together. ""She wants to be your wife.""

""But I don't want her. Not like that. Never like that.""

He gave me a measured look. ""You sure about that?""

I lied to him then and said I was.

But the truth?

I enjoy Diana's company.

She looks up to me and talks to me like I'm some kind of financial genius. It soothes my ego.

Mia is a kindergarten teacher. She knows nothing about high finance. I love her. But for a while there, she didn't excite me.

Even remembering how I felt makes me feel guilty, especially now, after that da-mned ki-ss.

Especially now that I realize I confused new and shiny with excitement, which made me ignore my wife, maybe even resent her a little.

I can't believe I let it happen. Let another woman ki-ss me. Place her lips on mine. Be intimate with me.

It was after Thanksgiving Dinner.

Diana says she wants to talk about work. We go outside in the snow and walk to the gazebo. My mother just had it built.

It comes with a gla-ss cover.

It's pleasant, even on a frigid day.

""Aiden, I want to ask you something."" She looks nervous. I give her a rea-ssuring look.

""Anything, Di.""

She smiles, licks her lips. ""I...don't...."" She trails off, shaking her head. ""I...never mind.""

""Sweetheart, what's up?""

She looks at me with moist eyes, and my heart pounds in my chest. Something is wrong, and I want to fix it. I don't like seeing Diana upset.

""Are you happy in your marriage?"" Her words are a whisper.

I frown. ""What?""

""Are you?""

""Yes...I think so.""

She puts a hand on my chest. ""We spend a lot of time together, Aiden. I can feel it, too.""

I look at her painted nails, Fire Engine Red, against the white of my dress shirt. I raise my eyes to hers. ""Feel what?""

""Us.""

She steps closer. Goes on tiptoe and...places her lips against mine.

It's a shock.

My mouth opens without me thinking about it. Her tongue touches mine.

For a moment, we stay locked.

Then, an eternity later, reality slams into me. I step back, away from her, away from the man I don't want to be.

""What the he-ll, Diana?"" I snap, furiously swiping my mouth with the back of my hand, as if I can scrub away the taint she's just put on my marriage.

Whatever flicker of attraction I once felt for her—something I can admit now—vanishes in an instant, burned out by anger and disgust.

She's exciting. Interesting. Understands my work. Is beautiful as fu-ck.

But she isn't Mia.

She isn't soft, warm, and gentle. She doesn't make me laugh with stories about her students. She doesn't make sure that I have my migraine pills with me, because she can see, even before I can, that it's coming. She doesn't hold my hand when my father makes me feel small. She doesn't do any of that.

I love my wife.

I'm happy in my marriage.

What the fu-ck have I done?

""I know,"" she breathes. Steps closer.

I hold a hand up to stop her, to keep her away from me. ""Know what?""

""That you're not happy in your marriage.""

""What the fu-ck are you talking about?""

My entire being is horrified at what just happened.

I ki-ssed another woman. I couldn't wrap my head around it. Since I met Mia, there has been no one else. Not even in fantasy. Even when I masturbate, it's to her.

""I know you want a child.""

I freeze.

Her words slice through me like a sharp, merciless blade.

I told Diana recently—something that isn't a secret in the family—that Mia can't have children. Endometriosis stole that from her. She wants to adopt, and God, I wish I could give her that without hesitation. But my parents are dead set against it, and the truth is, so am I.

I know exactly how they'll treat an adopted grandchild—like they're less than—and I can't bear the thought of bringing a child into that. So, I said no. And every time I think about it, I feel like I've failed Mia twice over.

""And?""

""I can give you a baby, Aiden. She can't.""

I shake my head as if that's going to help clear this mess I made.

""She's my wife, Diana. I love her.""

She scoffs at that. Her blue eyes blaze with irritation. ""Do you? You spend more time with me than with her, even on weekends. You have more dinners with me. You have more breakfasts with me than you do with her.""

""That's work, Diana."" But I'm lying. It was not always the case. I know it. She does, too.

""You missed your wedding anniversary to be with me in Paris.""

""We had a client meeting,"" I protest.

""You took me out to dinner on your wedding anniversary. A romantic dinner at the Eiffel Tower,"" she reminds me.

""That was...that was just because you said you wanted to eat at the Eiffel Tower.""

Why did I do that? Why did I miss my wedding anniversary and take this woman, who isn't my wife, anywhere?

I clench my jaw. ""It appears I have given you some signals that I didn't intend. I love my wife. I don't care that she can't have children. I'm not interested in you...se-xually. What you just pulled, Diana?"" I let out a huff of breath. ""Don't ever do something like that again.""

Three weeks have gone by since Thanksgiving, and that ki-ss weighs like a ton of bricks inside of me.

At work, I've cut my interactions with Diana down to the bare minimum. No more casual chats, no more small talk. If I speak to her, it's strictly business—and whenever possible, I make sure there's a chaperone in the room. Sometimes two.

She's not taking it well.

""I know you're feeling guilty, but if a marriage is not working, it's not,"" she tells me after my first week of keeping her at an arm's length. ""I know from experience. You're a good man. You don't want to hurt Mia. But staying with her when it's not right will end up hurting you both in the long run.""

I ki-ssed another woman. I'm definitely not a good man.

However, that ki-ss made one thing crystal clear—I don't want Diana.

She might have been a stimulating mind to spar with about Winter Financial, but that's all she ever was: a colleague, not a partner. She was never someone I could be with emotionally. She's been a decent sounding board for the CEO in me, but never for the man I am. The man I am needs Mia. Loves Mia. Without her, my days would turn black.

""Don't talk to me about this bullsh-it again,"" I retort. ""If you do, I swear to God, Diana, you'll be looking for a new job.""

She went straight to my father, who told me to man up and take what I want. In the past week, my mother has told me that maybe it's time to let Mia go. My sister, Gianna, has also shared her thoughts on the matter, as has my brother, Tristan.

My family's never liked Mia—never thought she was right for me. And when they found out we couldn't have kids, that pushed them right over the edge.

But my wife? he-ll, she's a saint. She still tries with them. Still smiles. Still offers kindness they don't deserve. Still holds her patience, even when I know every word from them is designed to cut.

And what do you do, Aiden?

You let her work hard for their approval and never tell them to accept your wife for who she is.

Why the he-ll else would they think you'd be interested in leaving her?

Since that ki-ss, I've spent more time in introspection than my whole life put together. I can see I've been a terrible husband to the best wife a man can have.

Mia's love is clean. Pure.

She has no one. Like Diana. No siblings, no parents. Her friend Katya's family is hers, just like the Winters are Diana's. But the similarities end there. Diana is entitled. I can see that now. Mia is absolutely not. Diana is polished but also a little fake. Mia is genuine. And most importantly, there isn't a situation, not even with a gun to her head, where Mia would make a pa-ss at a married man.

""I'm going to bed,"" Mia announces, bringing me back to our dining room, to our marriage that I know is fraying at the edges. She looks at the table and the dishes in the kitchen and sighs. ""I'll take care of it tomorrow.""

The hits keep coming.

She cooks and cleans.

After dinner, I usually go into my home office and spend a couple of hours there. I've always worked long hours. But since I took over as CEO after my father stepped down a couple of years ago, around the time Diana joined Winter Financial, I've been busier than ever.

Mia says she understands but implores me to pursue balance. ""Can't work all the time, Aiden. You have to make room for play, to relax, to even get bored.""

""I'll clean up, baby."" I smile at her.

There's a flare of surprise in her eyes.

That's the kind of sh-itty husband I am that my wife is shocked I volunteered to help her with a household chore.

She shrugs. ""You don't have to.""

She doesn't wait to see if I agree with her or not. She just leaves.

I know something is very wrong. I can feel it.

My premonition proves correct.

Mia

I lie in bed and stare at the ceiling.

My heart hurts.

My Aiden ki-ssed another woman.

My Aiden doesn't love me.

My Aiden is not mine.

We met eight years ago. I was so young. Just twenty-two, studying to become a kindergarten teacher. He was thirty, having already completed the educational part of his life, and was working at his family's business.

I had no money. He had too much.

I had no family. He had everyone, even grandparents.

Nothing much has changed, has it? I still have no money. I still have no family.

We live in a very nice home in Burlington, Vermont, one we bought together. With his money, obviously. But he always said everything he had was mine. It was our money.

It felt like a dream. Like I'd won the lottery, not the financial kind but the kind of love I thought only happened in movies.

The first time he saw me, I was shelving books in the children's section of the bookstore where I worked part-time. He walked in, tall and polished in a charcoal-gray coat, lost in the stacks like he didn't belong among the tiny tables and mismatched rugs.

I asked if I could help him. He wanted to buy a book as a Christmas present for his two-year-old nephew. I recommended Corduroy.

He thanked me. Said I had beautiful eyes.

He kept coming back.

Every Friday at 4 p.m., like clockwork, he would buy another book for his nephew.

When he finally asked me to dinner, I said no the first time. And the second.

I knew who he was. In Burlington, everyone knew the Winter family. They were wealthy beyond belief.

He kept asking, especially when I told him that he was not in my league. He said he loved that about me, that I wasn't like the women he knew. That I saw him, not his bank account.

He made me feel special.

Chosen.

That's the part that hurts the most now.

Because when he ki-ssed her, Diana Valentine, he un-chose me.

After all these years of loyalty—of swallowing my pride and putting up with his family because he loves them—even though they treat me like dirt ground into their custom Persian rugs...he still discarded me.

All the times I smiled through his mother's digs about my wardrobe being 'too schoolteacher-like', sat through dinner parties where she practically introduced me as Aiden's charity case, swallowed his father calling me barren, endured his sister's little jabs—like saying I probably couldn't even spell ""fiduciary""—and his brother and sister-in-law's constant reminders that we were childless because my body had failed Aiden....

And what do I have to show for it?

Nothing.

No—that's not true. I have a broken heart to match my broken uterus.

It wasn't like this all the time. I wonder how many women, who see their marriage disintegrate, say that.

Before Aiden took over as CEO, he would wake up before me, make me coffee, and we'd drink it together while we ate breakfast. He was always home for dinner. He sent me text messages all day.

Even after the doctors said I had endometriosis, which had made me infertile, he never made me feel bad about it. When I suggested we should adopt, he told me that would be a bad idea, considering his parents would have a problem with it. We talked about surrogacy. We talked about a lot of things regarding having children—not once did he tell me that he resented me for us not being able to have children.

All that changed when he became the CEO and Diana returned to Burlington.

It started slowly, the way these things usually do.

A missed dinner—followed by an apology.

A missed birthday—followed by flowers and an apology.

A missed wedding anniversary—followed by a gift, flowers, and an apology.

And then he started missing more and more...and stopped apologizing.

Just a casual, ""You understand, don't you, baby? It's so busy.""

As if I didn't even deserve an explanation.

I took it. I swallowed my hurt. I wanted to be supportive. I wanted to be a good wife.

I wanted to—God help me—keep him.

Tears fill my eyes.

I was afraid of losing him.

That's the reason I let his family abuse me.

Let him disrespect me by spending more and more time with another woman.

I allowed this to happen.

I was so busy being a good wife, I didn't realize that I was compensating for him being a sh-it husband.

I mean, who takes his work wife (yeah, I know what they call Diana) to Paris on his wedding anniversary? An a-sshole does. A man who isn't worthy of being called husband.

I let my need for a family take precedence over my need to be seen. I kept shrinking, kept smiling, kept hoping and praying that Aiden wouldn't leave me.

And now?

Now, I'm lying in a bed we picked out together, in a house I helped turn into a home, wondering how long I've been disappearing—little pieces at a time.

I turn my head to look at his side of the bed. It's empty. Devoid.

Deciding to leave him has resulted in heartache, absolutely.

But surprisingly, there is also peace.

I no longer have to live in fear that he's going to abandon me, because that already happened. I don't have to be terrified of him asking me for a divorce, because that's happening. I don't have to be petrified of the idea that he's going to choose another, better woman, because...he's done that, too.

All my nightmares have come true, so I don't have to fear them anymore.

I lay a hand on the cold pillow.

Is he working in his office downstairs, or is he mourning the version of us that I'm still fighting to remember?

My eyes fall on the photo on his nightstand. It's his favorite. At least that's the bullsh-it he sold me.

It's when we got engaged. It's candid.

The bookstore manager took it. That's where he proposed to me, where we first met. Aiden had told her he was planning on proposing to me, so she was ready for it.

I'm laughing while he ki-sses my lips.

The ring is beautiful.

My eyes are filled with happiness.

His smile is wide.

We look like a couple who'll make it.

I look away from it, draw my hand back from the unoccupied pillow, and rest my chin on the fist I curl beneath it as I turn my back to his side of the bed.

I don't cry.

I've cried enough.

I have pain, yes. But I also have a plan.

I have the divorce papers. I am going to reclaim my dignity. I'm not going to be a doormat any longer. I'm going to be someone I can be proud of.

But...the ache in my chest tells me one thing⁠—

No matter how broken he's made me feel, I still love him.

And that might be the cruelest betrayal of all.

When the bedroom door opens, I close my eyes, pretending to be asleep.

I've never done this.

I waited for him, cuddled with him, and talked to him. And, now I realize, forced him to pay attention to me.

I hear the gentle click of the handle, the faint shuffle of his bare feet on the carpet.

Aiden. He moves quietly, like he thinks I might be asleep. Or maybe he's hoping I am?

He goes into the bathroom. I hear the sounds of the shower, the toothbrush, of Aiden—familiar sounds, routine, intimate.

Will I miss this in two nights?

Those are the number of nights we have left together.

Tonight.

Tomorrow night.

And then it's Christmas Eve, when we'll open presents after dinner, as is the Winter tradition. The kids get their presents before dinner so they can be put to bed right after they finish eating—shuttled off with nannies who don't get Christmas off.

That's when I will end this.

Aiden slips under the covers beside me, his body warm and familiar, and somehow, because of that ki-ss I saw him sharing with Diana, cold and strange.

I used to turn toward him, automatically. My cheek would find his chest, his arm would wrap around my waist. I'd exhale like I'd come home.

I don't move now. I lie there, tense, facing away.

A moment pa-sses. Two.

Then his hand rests lightly on my hip.

""Mia,"" he murmurs, voice low. He shifts closer, his body curling around mine.

His fingers brush the bare skin at my waist, under the edge of my sleep shirt.

His mouth finds the curve of my neck, presses a ki-ss there. Soft. Tentative.

I feel nothing. No spark. No flutter. Just a rising wave of cold.

I make a sound like I'm fast asleep.

He ki-sses my shoulder.

""Baby, wake up,"" he cajoles, trying again, like we haven't drifted into two entirely different solar systems.

I mumble something like I'm in the middle of my REM cycle.

I don't know if I'm fooling him or not, but I don't care.

I can't make-love with him. Not after he was with another woman.

I saw them ki-ss, but they've probably had se-x, too. Did he ever make-love to her and then come home and fu-ck me? Because that's what it is, isn't it? fu-cking...when there is no love?

I relax my body to convince him to leave me alone so I can sleep.

How many wives do this as a way to not have se-x with their spouses?

The cliché of it stings, but the truth behind it is worse. I'm in so much pain, from what he did, from holding back the truth, from pretending we're still us.

He hesitates. His hand lingers a moment before he withdraws it.

I can feel the tension seeping out of him.

Confusion.

Frustration.

Guilt?

I almost want to comfort him. The old me would. She would've rolled over and ki-ssed him. Told him it was okay. That she understood. That tomorrow would be better.

But that Mia has packed her bags and left.

I feel his lips brush against my cheek. ""Goodnight, sweetheart.""

That guts me. He calls Diana sweetheart, too. Is he thinking of her right now?

I don't say anything.

If I open my mouth, I'll scream. Or cry. Or admit that I miss him, too, and that would be worse than either of those.

He lies on his back.

I listen to his breathing settle.

It doesn't take him long—it never does. Five minutes later, he's out.

It takes me longer to fall asleep as I grieve the loss of the illusion of Aiden, of a man who made me believe love was enough. A man who doesn't exist.

I have to face facts. He doesn't love me; if he did, he wouldn't have touched Diana. If he did, he wouldn't have abandoned me the way he has.

The ki-ss I witnessed is the culmination of what's been going on for two long years.

That ki-ss was my wake-up call.

Five years after my divorce from Julian Sterling, a girl walked into my corner coffee shop. 

She was six or seven, delicate–featured with eyes and brows achingly familiar. She stared at me 

without blinking. 

Our eyes met, and the pain I’d buried came flooding back. 

Something in me wanted to keep her there. 

“Would you like to try some coffee, sweetie? This one’s called Spring Whisper. You’ll like it.” 

She took the cup carefully, listening as I rambled about everything and nothing. 

I told her I used to own the biggest coffee company in the country. Someone took it from me. 

I told her I once had a daughter who would have been about her age. 

The girl asked curiously if I hated the bad people who took my things. 

I lowered my eyes and looked at her for a long time before flashing a bright smile. 

“There can be no hate without love.” 

“It’s been five years. I let it go a long time ago.” 

\*\*\* 

Rain started drumming against the windows. 

The girl watched, paused mid–sip, and furrowed her brows. 

“Oh no! I got distracted and forgot about Daddy’s engagement party!” 

“And the chauffeur isn’t here…” 

She stared at the entrance and suddenly gasped. 

“That suit… is Daddy here to catch me?” 

I followed her gaze. A black suit flashed past the doorway but didn’t come in. 

Probably just someone ducking out of the rain. 

I looked away and turned to Nina instead, trying to comfort her. 

“It’s okay, Nina. I’ll drive you there in a bit.” 

She tilted her head, her eyes softening with a flicker of affection.

“Thank you!” 

“Daddy only drinks whiskey anyway. He hates coffee. He’d never look for me in a coffee shop!” 

“He won’t even let me like it. So bossy!” 

As Nina complained about her father’s heartlessness, her words pulled up memories of someone else. 

He hated coffee the same way. Hated me too. 

Nina’s voice brought me back. 

“Where’s your daughter? Is she at school?” 

She settled back in her chair, legs swinging. 

My hands stilled over the coffee set. Water rushed over porcelain. 

“She’s gone.” 

“When she was very small.” 

Nina went quiet, then whispered, “I’m sorry.” 

“It’s all right.” 

I set down my coffee, gazing out at the gray sky. 

My daughter’s death was a thorn lodged deep. The slightest mention, and the pain came back. 

But something about Nina made me want to tell her everything. 

I smiled. “Want to hear a story?” 

My name is Grace Yates. I was the heiress to Port Haven’s largest coffee company. 

My childhood friend was the Sterling heir. His family owned the city’s biggest whiskey company. 

Our families went back generations. Our parents were close. 

He and I hated each other. 

I was allergic to whiskey. He couldn’t stand the smell of coffee. 

Every time we saw each other, we ended up trading insults and fighting like the world was coming 

apart. 

Everything changed when we were eighteen. On a family trip, our car went through a guardrail. 

Julian could have saved his parents. He chose me instead.

On our wedding day, his hands shook as he slid the ring on. 

If I’d known what he was really feeling, I wouldn’t have thought it was just nerves. 

Nina frowned, unable to stop herself.

“I’ve acquired Yates Corporation. You and your parents owed me this.” 

“I won’t divorce you. That’s all you get.” 

He walked away without looking back. I just stood there, shattered.

I followed her gaze. A black suit flashed past the doorway but didn’t come in. 

Probably just someone ducking out of the rain. 

I looked away and turned to Nina instead, trying to comfort her. 

“It’s okay, Nina. I’ll drive you there in a bit.” 

She tilted her head, her eyes softening with a flicker of affection. 

Chapter 1

“Thank you!” 

“Daddy only drinks whiskey anyway. He hates coffee. He’d never look for me in a coffee shop!” 

“He won’t even let me like it. So bossy!” 

As Nina complained about her father’s heartlessness, her words pulled up memories of someone else. 

He hated coffee the same way. Hated me too. 

Nina’s voice brought me back. 

“Where’s your daughter? Is she at school?” 

She settled back in her chair, legs swinging. 

My hands stilled over the coffee set. Water rushed over porcelain. 

“She’s gone.” 

“When she was very small.” 

Nina went quiet, then whispered, “I’m sorry.” 

“It’s all right.” 

I set down my coffee, gazing out at the gray sky. 

My daughter’s death was a thorn lodged deep. The slightest mention, and the pain came back. 

But something about Nina made me want to tell her everything. 

I smiled. “Want to hear a story?” 

My name is Grace Yates. I was the heiress to Port Haven’s largest coffee company. 

My childhood friend was the Sterling heir. His family owned the city’s biggest whiskey company. 

Our families went back generations. Our parents were close. 

He and I hated each other. 

I was allergic to whiskey. He couldn’t stand the smell of coffee. 

Every time we saw each other, we ended up trading insults and fighting like the world was coming 

apart. 

Everything changed when we were eighteen. On a family trip, our car went through a guardrail. 

Julian could have saved his parents. He chose me instead. 

Chapter 1 

His parents died instantly. 

My parents felt grateful and guilty. They nearly bentripted themselves helping him stabilize company when he took over 

Like something out of a movie, love crept in as we spent our days side by side. 

The man who’d mastered sarcasm turned gentle when he loved 

He remembered everything I liked. 

Every morning, he’d wait in line for an hour to buy me fresh croissants. 

When I was being difficult, he’d choke down a whole cup of coffee despite hating it 

On our wedding day, his hands shook as he slid the ring on. 

If I’d known what he was really feeling, I wouldn’t have thought it was just nerves. 

Nina frowned, unable to stop herself. 

“If Uncle Julian was so nice, how did someone steal your company? 

Even a six–year–old could see it. 

But I couldn’t see it. 

After we married, he was even better to me. He put me first in everything, 

Yet whenever I made coffee, he would lose himself watching **my** profile. 

Conflicted. Struggling with something, Guilty. 

I thought he was still grieving his parents. 

A year later, on that same stretch of road, **my** parents‘ car suffered brake failure and went over the 

cliff. 

They both died. 

At the funeral, I collapsed in Julian’s arms, sobbing **until** I couldn’t breathe. 

Then he pushed me away. He stepped into the center of the hall and pulled out a stack of documents. 

“I’ve acquired Yates Corporation. You and your parents owed me this.” 

“I won’t divorce you. That’s all you get.” 

He walked away without looking back. I just stood there, shattered. 

In a single day, I’d lost everyone I loved. And I became Port Haven’s laughingstock ",1,1767685806.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

My connecting flight to the US was cancelled on the tarmac.
Amsterdam is recovering from strong winds and some snow. I live in MN so to me it looked insignificant. The real issue is/was the de-icing process. It takes hours for planes to get a slot in one of the 4 de-icing stations. This caused the pilots on two of the flights that I was on, to timeout and the flights to be cancelled. 
That happens on Sunday 4-th and Monday 5th. Yesterday I got another flight for the 6th. At 11 PM that flight gets cancelled. 
So on the phone with Delta I see availability on the premium and delta one cabins which the agend denied to put me in. They give me a flight for the 7th, more then 36 hours.

Here is where Delta really ""shined""

Speaking with a supervisor, he agrees to give me any cabin, but he doesn't see the spots that I see. They are visible on delta.com, the previous agent sees them, but the supervisor doesn't. He tells me that I can buy it and hope for reimbursement. Which I really would like to avoid to be put in Delta 's mercy. He tells me to go to the airport in the morning and see what they can do for me. 

This morning, bright and early I go to schipol, and this place is like a war zone. People sleeping on the floors, really long lines for accommodation, but the check in line is manageable. After about 30 minutes I am taking to an agent and I plea for any last minute openings.

She finds one right away on the direct flight, leaving in 2 hours. After 30 minutes on hold with delta she gets me an isle seat . WHAT? This is a delta flight!!!!

So I open the delta app and what do I see. For that flight 177 open seats, 70 in the premium cabins. 
So either the app is not correct or Delta is flying half empty planes while paying hotels and meals for stranded passengers. 
At the very least, Delta's systems are really messed up....

Wondering what the community thoughts are on this? Is Delta's system so messed up that agents don't see all availability, is Delta really flying half full flights while paying hotels for stranded travelers. Still on the airport and snow is picking up, so hopefully this flight doesn't get cancelled.

After circling Terra a handful of times to slow her speed, the descent of the Gryphon was rapid. The spacecraft was a Pegasus-type Ohio class warship that had been repurposed as a deep space research vessel, FTL propelled to investigate the anomaly detected near Sagittarius A\* by a combination of nuclear fusion and Alcubierre warp drive. Approximately a year ago UTC the Shadowfax re-entry vehicle had been launched via fire-breathing Dragon SpaceY chemical rockets, and the historical and etymological significance of the final destination for its far-flung heat shields was not lost on the all-seeing Her. The air was to blame for the flames that could melt metal, and yet the atmosphere as expected cushioned the fall. The capsule had been designed with such conditions in mind, so Mother only metaphorically smiled while ceramic tiles and random jetsam littered the bucolic Albion countryside. Future radiocasts and retellings wondered whether the intervention wasn't divine given the surprising lack of casualties. Multiple news outlets reported near misses, recounting seemingly improbable instances of debris just barely avoiding total catastrophe. British encyclopedists struggled to explain the improbable events, often referring to it as ""miraculous"".



While Avery was glad to finally open his eyes and find himself still alive, he could hardly call the crash landing miraculous. The goal had been to land in the great expanse of the Pacific, but Gaia's rotation was slightly different than the 24 hours expected. In a last ditch effort, Mother had recalculated the entry for the Atlantic. However, the atmosphere was just slightly different enough from the composition stored on board (or critical measurement devices malfunctioned) such that the craft crashed into the River Kent as an emergency escape pod landed in a nearby pasture to the alarmed baa's of its inhabitants. The Royal Air Force was publicly shamed for the incident catching it off guard, but a full inquiry absolved all responsible, in part due to the strange cargo. After the fireworks show, it didn't take long before The Service arrived.



Fortunately for our spacefarer, the cavalry was cautious and held back the hounds. Coms failed but when he finally came out he held up his hands as they steadied their indexes. The medics rushed in to collect him as he collapsed to the ground, still dizzy from vertigo. A cab chopped air to the nearest military hospital, where the protagonist was handled with extreme care. The crew on the ground performed a perfectly choreographed impromptu dance cordoning off the scene and collecting evidence. Not much of the craft was recovered in tact, but the bits that remain made headlines later and prompted many conspiracies and investigations. Avery later learned that on this Earth, ""SpaceZ"" (run by a ""Kat Ivory"") had sent ""Guy"" to explore a similar anomaly about a year before. Not only experts were baffled that the prodigal son who'd returned was not the one they expected. And yet, as they pieced it together, the two seemed eerily similar. Guy's life had followed a similar trajectory, and Avery's world seemed familiar yet different, as if the specific details had been slightly altered. The basic machinery was the same; it was clear that the proposed alternate universe (there is no way this was a hoax) operated on the same physical laws, and seemed proximately close in time in its development. But it was not easy interfacing with the foreign technology. The form factors were slightly different, and while the foundation of the code was again, as expected, the same, the languages and syntax differed. Fortunately, Avery's accent of English was easy enough to comprehend, though he spent some time in bed recovering before they had a chance for a ""dialogue"" (that shortly devolved into an inquisition, though lucky Avery was spared the worst).



The international incident caught a lot of attention, so it was weeks before Avery was let in public. He was allowed to walk in a nearby park under constant surveillance, with agents jogging and playing tennis. The man was, understandably, shaken and in a quandary. As he paced the pavement lost in thought, he noticed out of the corner of his eye, off in the distance, someone who looked familiar. He had resigned himself to losing his beloved Constance, and so looked away dejected, putting the thought out of mind. Funny though, she had a similar terrier to the one they'd shared. It was a lot to take in, the new world he'd found himself in, but the most crushing part was the knowledge that there was no Constance in this universe. He had journeyed to the stars for her, and wished he'd never come back. The physicists concluded the black hole anomaly caused the warp drive to malfunction, slipping the cosmonaut into a parallel dimension of astronauts; most likely, Guy was in Avery's world. Avery felt for his doppelgänger, who must be experiencing the same thoughts and feelings. The walk wasn't long, but Avery remembered how græy and dreary it'd been.



Through all the monotony and tortuous testing, Avery eagerly awaited the second arranged exercise outing. He'd hoped that woman he saw might be there. He thought, maybe some things are constant, the physical laws are. They hadn't yet told him that *everything* was different--there was no way to know. There were a lot of similarities, it almost felt like being in a dream, or tripping. He felt antsy, his legs were restless, and he wanted to see the sky, even if he couldn't see the sun. He had to wear sunglasses and nondescript clothing per protocol. They were more or less familiar, though the name brands differed. The trends were slightly different--this world seemed strangely a bit more vibrant than the more muted one he recalled. Sadly, it was rainy that day. Avery kept dry under his umbrella, but his heart only skipped and sank as he realized each figure was different. As he was escorted away, he looked back, and could've sworn he saw her.



Who was she? Surely the area was contained, but not too obviously, that would attract attention. The mental and physical examinations were exhausting. He was well-trained for them, but not for a repeated marathon such as this. It was only the flagging in his abilities and noncooperation that prompted the handlers to permit him outside. It's all he thought of, all he held on to anymore. He had cried himself to sleep among the many sleepless nights. The nurses and staff were always kind to him though, and Avery always profusely thanked them. Few were permitted to know much, but they all spread gossip, and most felt sorry for him. And he was so kind, a real gentleman. But so saturnine, it tugged at their heartstrings.



Avery tempered his hopes for the third outing. He was looking forward to it regardless, and it was, for once, a sunny day. He took that as a positive sign. Either way, Sol's rays were refreshing, and as he took a deep breath his olfactory receptors caught all the pungent scents in the air that spring day, with freshly cut grass, perfume, and coffee tickling his nostrils. He liked to play a game, guessing which people were agents and which weren't. He smiled and waved to them all, if they looked his way. He sat down on a bench to breathe in the scenery and soak in the sun as bagpipes played in the distance, when at the end of the bench sat a woman in all black, with a grieving veil covering her face.



Avery sat dumbstruck, paralyzed, with too much going on his head to say hello, let alone acknowledge her presence. With a tremble and slight stumble, the stranger stammered, ""N-Nice weather, innit? ... Nice the—""



""—sun's out, yes, beautiful day!"", Avery ejaculated. ""The birdsong's lovely, too... Ehm, you look familiar, do you come here often?""



""Not until recently, I don't live here... But I was looking for a guy I know...""



Avery cocked his head, but his heart steadied his mind as he shifted to compassion. He blurted out artlessly, ""Oh. Did something happen to him?""



The stranger stifled a giggle, and suppressed tears Avery couldn't see. Avery was so perplexed by the response and found her laugh so familiar and infectious he couldn't help himself let a laugh of his own escape aloud. His cheeks immediately flushed as he course corrected: ""Er, sorry, I didn't mean to offend, that's no laughing matter. It's — never mind, I hope he's alright?""



There was a pause as the dame composed herself. Avery's heart sank to the pit of his stomach as butterflies began eating his lungs. Had he said something wrong—

""I really hope so, but I don't know, we lost contact with his ship six months ago. Since then, we've seen a nearly identical one approach, and it's said to have made landfall nearby. The government's kept quiet so far about what occurred, with so much noise flooding the corporate airwaves It's absurd. I have a lot of... intelligent friends, you might say, and they pointed me this way.""



This was a lot to take in for our hero, who absorbed the implications. Surely something similar must be happening to ""Guy"" in his original dimension, and Constance would no-doubt pull strings to find him. It was hard to believe they would not have informed her of their discovery, but perhaps they had left it to him to be the bearer of bad news. He wished he himself could shoot the messenger.



Quickening to an almost manic pace, she raced to say, ""Sorry, I bet that sounded crazy. It's funny, you know you sound like him, by the way. Sorta look like him too, he's very handsome."" This time, Avery could feel her cry, as if she ran out of air for words. With grace, she continued, as cheerfully as she could muster while drying her eyes: ""Sorry, I'm off my rocker, it's just — it's been a lot, and I miss him. I hope he's okay.""



Avery wanted to wrap her in his arms and reassure her more than anything in that moment. To see her so deflated, he nearly dissociated, flying back into the bench, pulled towards the ninth circle of hell. Autopilot came on as he responded, ""I've been through something similar. I miss her too. You remind me of her too.""



A dense patch of cumulonimbus wafted lazily overhead, obscuring the sun. Unable to contain her excitement, the maiden lifted her veil. ""Is it you? Is it p-possible?""



Avery averted her gaze, shades still on his face, as he contemplated what to say.



""Please tell me!"" she exclaimed. Almost pouting, she proclaimed, ""But, no, you seem different. I'm sorry mister, this was a mistake.""



As she motioned to leave, Avery closed his eyes, removed his glasses, sighed, smiled, and looked her in the eyes. ""My name is Avery. I believe we've met in another dimension, but it's nice to meet you again."" He extended his hand.



A flash of horror possessed the stranger's mien but her shock relaxed as her expression quickly turned to a quixotic one, with lips pursed and eyebrows furled. This was not the response she'd expected and the possibilities flooded her mind. But she could not lie or refuse the politeness of a stranger, and perhaps he just needed a gentle reminder? ""I'm Klarity, it's a pleasure to meet you,"" she squeaked as she held his hand. It felt so familiar, like the first time she'd met Guy.



Avery, meanwhile, shivered as flashbacks of Constance inundated his spine. The clouds passed by and the sun shined. ""Nice to make your acquaintance, Klarity.""



In unison, they smiled and added: ""Charmed, I'm sure.""",1,1767685406.0,DiabolicOughts,0,1.0,False

Ava

The final echo of the previous class lecture still rang in my head as I shoved my notebook into my backpack and checked the time on my phone. Five forty-eight. Which meant I had exactly twelve minutes to get across town to the diner before I’d be late again. My boss had already warned me that if I came dragging in past six one more time, I’d be bussing tables instead of waiting them.

“Don’t run, don’t run,” I muttered to myself as I jogged anyway, weaving through the crowd of students spilling out of the Humanities building. My sneakers slapped the pavement, my ponytail smacked between my shoulders, and the late September air was cool enough to sting my lungs.

The bus stop was already crowded, and waiting wasn’t an option, so I cut through the side streets, legs pumping harder. I wasn’t built for athletics — I was built for caffeine, sarcasm, and just enough stubbornness to stay alive in both college and a food-service job.

Still, I made it. Six on the dot.

The little bell over the diner’s glass door jingled as I pushed in. A wall of smells hit me — coffee, grease, pie crust, and fried onions, the signature perfume of Mel’s Diner. The fluorescent lights buzzed, the floor gleamed with its permanent layer of waxy grime, and the booths were filling up with regulars who didn’t need menus anymore.

“Cutting it close again, Ava,” called Jessie, another waitress, from behind the counter. Her lipstick was already smudged, her eyeliner perfect. She lived for drama — work gossip was her oxygen.

“Yeah, yeah,” I said, tying on my apron. “But technically, I’m not late.”

She smirked, chewing her gum. “Technically. Mr. Bailey’s already in his booth, and you know he’ll tattle if you don’t bring his coffee before you even clock in.”

I groaned, but she wasn’t wrong.

Mr. Bailey was eighty-seven, a retired math teacher, and my self-appointed supervisor. He came in at exactly 6:02 every evening for “his” booth and acted like my promptness was a matter of life or death. The man didn’t need a watch — he had me.

“On it,” I sighed, and grabbed a fresh pot of coffee.

As I crossed the floor, weaving between tables, I caught snippets of conversation — laughter, silverware clinking, the static from the little wall-mounted TV near the counter. But underneath all that, there was something sharper. Voices from the street outside, way too clear considering the windows were shut. A guy asking if someone had jumper cables, a girl complaining about her boyfriend’s cheap cologne.

It wasn’t new. My hearing had always been… off. Too sharp sometimes, too selective at others. Mom used to call it “selective hearing” when I was a kid, which made it sound like I was just ignoring her. I’d mostly learned to tune it out, but sometimes it slipped through like tonight.

I set the mug in front of Mr. Bailey before he could look at his watch and got a grunt of approval. Mission accomplished.

By seven, the place was hopping. I was balancing plates on my arm, scribbling orders, flashing my best fake smile. Between customers I’d sneak glances at my notes shoved under the counter — a mess of highlighted definitions from Psych 201. The exam tomorrow was going to murder me, but tips tonight would pay for next semester’s books. My stomach twisted at the thought of the rent bill waiting at home.

“Table four wants refills,” Jessie called, dumping her tray by the dishwasher. “And they want you, not me. Guess you’re the favorite.”

“Lucky me,” I muttered, and went.

Halfway there, a weird vibration tickled the edge of my awareness. Not sound, exactly. More like… pressure, the way the air gets before a storm. I shook it off and plastered on a smile for table four, joking with them while pouring sweet tea.

But the sensation didn’t go away.

It grew stronger, like the room was humming around me. The hair on my arms rose, goosebumps prickling, and I had the strangest urge to step outside. Like something was waiting.

I told myself I was being ridiculous. Probably low blood sugar. I hadn’t eaten since noon.

Then the fire alarm went off across the street.

The shrill wail sliced through the diner, and everyone’s heads jerked toward the windows. Red light flashed against the glass, and a dark plume of smoke curled into the dusky sky.

“Holy crap,” Jessie whispered. “That’s the apartment building.”

Half the customers were already out of their booths, pressing against the glass or spilling onto the sidewalk. I grabbed a tray to look busy, heart thudding, but my eyes fixed on the street as the sirens wailed closer.

And that’s when I saw them.

The firetruck screamed to a halt, and the firefighters leapt down, hauling gear with practiced urgency. Helmets, jackets, axes — they were a blur of motion and authority. But my gaze caught on one.

Tall. Broad shoulders under heavy gear. Dark hair damp with sweat, plastered to his forehead. His jaw was cut sharp enough to slice steel, his eyes—

His eyes met mine across the street.

And the world stuttered.

Heat surged through me, not embarrassment, not attraction, something raw and feral. My lungs forgot how to work. The noise around me faded into static. It was just him, and the way my pulse thundered like it was answering his.

He looked at me like he recognized me. Like I wasn’t a stranger at all.

Then someone shouted his name — too far away for me to hear, yet I did.

“Luca!”

He turned back to his crew, breaking whatever that was, and I nearly dropped the tray in my hands. My palms tingled like I’d touched a live wire. My knees wanted to give out.

What the hell was that?

Then—

“Mate.”

The word cracked through my head like a whip. But it wasn’t my thought. It was a voice — female, husky, and smug as hell.

“Okay, losing it,” I whispered, clutching the booth’s edge so I didn’t fall.

Oh, you’re not losing it, honey. You’re gaining it. Him. Did you see the shoulders on that one?

My mouth dropped open. “Who—what—”

Seriously? I’m your wolf. You know, the growly part you’ve been ignoring your entire life? Surprise! And you’re welcome. Because that man— A throaty purr rolled through my mind. —is ours.

I blinked hard, trying to reset my brain. “No. Nope. I’m hallucinating. Too much coffee, not enough sleep.”

Or, she said, sounding unbearably smug, maybe your DNA finally decided to ring the doorbell. Hate to break it to you, sunshine, but this isn’t caffeine jitters. That’s your mate out there, and I am living for this.

“I don’t even know him,” I hissed, hugging the tray to my chest.

Then let’s get to know him. I bet he has a great laugh. And abs. Definitely abs. I can smell abs.

“Abs don’t have a smell!”

His do.

I choked on a laugh, earning a side-eye from Jessie behind the counter. I waved her off, pretending I’d spilled something, while inside my skull my life was unraveling.

Stop pretending you’re not into this. Your heart’s practically trying to claw its way out of your chest just to get to him.

“Shut up,” I muttered.

Make me.

Before I could fire back, someone shouted from the street: “Luca!”

The firefighter — Luca — turned at the sound, hefted an axe, and vanished into the smoke-choked stairwell like it was nothing.

My wolf practically fanned herself. Ugh. Brave. Hot. Checks all my boxes. Tell me we’re keeping him.

“He’s not a stray puppy,” I snapped. “We’re not ‘keeping’ anyone.”

Correction: he’s a firefighter-shaped gift from the universe, and the bond says he’s ours. Do you really want to argue with destiny? Because spoiler alert: destiny wins.

My stomach flipped as the acrid scent of smoke wafted stronger through the diner’s vents, and I realized my hands were shaking. “This is insane. I’m going insane.”

Nope. You’re just finally paying attention. Took you long enough. I’ve been stuck watching reruns of your boring human routine for years. At least now we’ve got some action.

Jessie grabbed my arm suddenly. “Whoa, Ava, you okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“I—yeah—just, uh—dizzy,” I stammered, forcing a laugh that was too high-pitched to sound normal. “Forgot to eat.”

“Girl, you need sugar,” Jessie said, already fishing for a Coke behind the counter.

I nodded, pretending to be grateful, while inside my skull my wolf was still pacing like a caffeinated cheerleader.

Forget sugar. What you need is to get closer to our firefighter before he walks out of here and we miss our chance. Trust me, you’ll regret it forever.

Forever. The word dug into me, hot and terrifying.

1q5ce7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonalds/comments/1q5ce7y/celebrating_1_year_without_mcdonalds/,Celebrating 1 year without McDonalds!,"I saved over $1000 this year by making my own meals and coffee, and my mornings are so much better for it! My food is always exactly how I like it, and I don’t feel sluggish or disappointed afterward anymore.

I remember when McDonald’s was the gold standard for fast food in America. The fries were iconic, the burgers were consistent, and it actually felt like they cared about quality and customers. Now it’s gone completely downhill. Prices are ridiculous, portions feel smaller, orders are wrong half the time, and the food barely tastes like what it used to.

It’s honestly sad to see what’s happened to a place that used to be an American staple. At the end of last year, I finally decided I was done and wasn’t going to give them any more of my money.

Today marks one full year McDonald’s-free, and I don’t miss it at all! Cutting out McDonald’s has been the best New Year’s resolution I’ve ever made, and I encourage anyone thinking about it to do the same for 2026.

Ava

The final echo of the previous class lecture still rang in my head as I shoved my notebook into my backpack and checked the time on my phone. Five forty-eight. Which meant I had exactly twelve minutes to get across town to the diner before I’d be late again. My boss had already warned me that if I came dragging in past six one more time, I’d be bussing tables instead of waiting them.

“Don’t run, don’t run,” I muttered to myself as I jogged anyway, weaving through the crowd of students spilling out of the Humanities building. My sneakers slapped the pavement, my ponytail smacked between my shoulders, and the late September air was cool enough to sting my lungs.

The bus stop was already crowded, and waiting wasn’t an option, so I cut through the side streets, legs pumping harder. I wasn’t built for athletics — I was built for caffeine, sarcasm, and just enough stubbornness to stay alive in both college and a food-service job.

Still, I made it. Six on the dot.

The little bell over the diner’s glass door jingled as I pushed in. A wall of smells hit me — coffee, grease, pie crust, and fried onions, the signature perfume of Mel’s Diner. The fluorescent lights buzzed, the floor gleamed with its permanent layer of waxy grime, and the booths were filling up with regulars who didn’t need menus anymore.

“Cutting it close again, Ava,” called Jessie, another waitress, from behind the counter. Her lipstick was already smudged, her eyeliner perfect. She lived for drama — work gossip was her oxygen.

“Yeah, yeah,” I said, tying on my apron. “But technically, I’m not late.”

She smirked, chewing her gum. “Technically. Mr. Bailey’s already in his booth, and you know he’ll tattle if you don’t bring his coffee before you even clock in.”

I groaned, but she wasn’t wrong.

Mr. Bailey was eighty-seven, a retired math teacher, and my self-appointed supervisor. He came in at exactly 6:02 every evening for “his” booth and acted like my promptness was a matter of life or death. The man didn’t need a watch — he had me.

“On it,” I sighed, and grabbed a fresh pot of coffee.

As I crossed the floor, weaving between tables, I caught snippets of conversation — laughter, silverware clinking, the static from the little wall-mounted TV near the counter. But underneath all that, there was something sharper. Voices from the street outside, way too clear considering the windows were shut. A guy asking if someone had jumper cables, a girl complaining about her boyfriend’s cheap cologne.

It wasn’t new. My hearing had always been… off. Too sharp sometimes, too selective at others. Mom used to call it “selective hearing” when I was a kid, which made it sound like I was just ignoring her. I’d mostly learned to tune it out, but sometimes it slipped through like tonight.

I set the mug in front of Mr. Bailey before he could look at his watch and got a grunt of approval. Mission accomplished.

By seven, the place was hopping. I was balancing plates on my arm, scribbling orders, flashing my best fake smile. Between customers I’d sneak glances at my notes shoved under the counter — a mess of highlighted definitions from Psych 201. The exam tomorrow was going to murder me, but tips tonight would pay for next semester’s books. My stomach twisted at the thought of the rent bill waiting at home.

“Table four wants refills,” Jessie called, dumping her tray by the dishwasher. “And they want you, not me. Guess you’re the favorite.”

“Lucky me,” I muttered, and went.

Halfway there, a weird vibration tickled the edge of my awareness. Not sound, exactly. More like… pressure, the way the air gets before a storm. I shook it off and plastered on a smile for table four, joking with them while pouring sweet tea.

But the sensation didn’t go away.

It grew stronger, like the room was humming around me. The hair on my arms rose, goosebumps prickling, and I had the strangest urge to step outside. Like something was waiting.

I told myself I was being ridiculous. Probably low blood sugar. I hadn’t eaten since noon.

Then the fire alarm went off across the street.

The shrill wail sliced through the diner, and everyone’s heads jerked toward the windows. Red light flashed against the glass, and a dark plume of smoke curled into the dusky sky.

“Holy crap,” Jessie whispered. “That’s the apartment building.”

Half the customers were already out of their booths, pressing against the glass or spilling onto the sidewalk. I grabbed a tray to look busy, heart thudding, but my eyes fixed on the street as the sirens wailed closer.

And that’s when I saw them.

The firetruck screamed to a halt, and the firefighters leapt down, hauling gear with practiced urgency. Helmets, jackets, axes — they were a blur of motion and authority. But my gaze caught on one.

Tall. Broad shoulders under heavy gear. Dark hair damp with sweat, plastered to his forehead. His jaw was cut sharp enough to slice steel, his eyes—

His eyes met mine across the street.

And the world stuttered.

Heat surged through me, not embarrassment, not attraction, something raw and feral. My lungs forgot how to work. The noise around me faded into static. It was just him, and the way my pulse thundered like it was answering his.

He looked at me like he recognized me. Like I wasn’t a stranger at all.

Then someone shouted his name — too far away for me to hear, yet I did.

“Luca!”

He turned back to his crew, breaking whatever that was, and I nearly dropped the tray in my hands. My palms tingled like I’d touched a live wire. My knees wanted to give out.

What the hell was that?

Then—

“Mate.”

The word cracked through my head like a whip. But it wasn’t my thought. It was a voice — female, husky, and smug as hell.

“Okay, losing it,” I whispered, clutching the booth’s edge so I didn’t fall.

Oh, you’re not losing it, honey. You’re gaining it. Him. Did you see the shoulders on that one?

My mouth dropped open. “Who—what—”

Seriously? I’m your wolf. You know, the growly part you’ve been ignoring your entire life? Surprise! And you’re welcome. Because that man— A throaty purr rolled through my mind. —is ours.

I blinked hard, trying to reset my brain. “No. Nope. I’m hallucinating. Too much coffee, not enough sleep.”

Or, she said, sounding unbearably smug, maybe your DNA finally decided to ring the doorbell. Hate to break it to you, sunshine, but this isn’t caffeine jitters. That’s your mate out there, and I am living for this.

“I don’t even know him,” I hissed, hugging the tray to my chest.

Then let’s get to know him. I bet he has a great laugh. And abs. Definitely abs. I can smell abs.

“Abs don’t have a smell!”

His do.

I choked on a laugh, earning a side-eye from Jessie behind the counter. I waved her off, pretending I’d spilled something, while inside my skull my life was unraveling.

Stop pretending you’re not into this. Your heart’s practically trying to claw its way out of your chest just to get to him.

“Shut up,” I muttered.

Make me.

Before I could fire back, someone shouted from the street: “Luca!”

The firefighter — Luca — turned at the sound, hefted an axe, and vanished into the smoke-choked stairwell like it was nothing.

My wolf practically fanned herself. Ugh. Brave. Hot. Checks all my boxes. Tell me we’re keeping him.

“He’s not a stray puppy,” I snapped. “We’re not ‘keeping’ anyone.”

Correction: he’s a firefighter-shaped gift from the universe, and the bond says he’s ours. Do you really want to argue with destiny? Because spoiler alert: destiny wins.

My stomach flipped as the acrid scent of smoke wafted stronger through the diner’s vents, and I realized my hands were shaking. “This is insane. I’m going insane.”

Nope. You’re just finally paying attention. Took you long enough. I’ve been stuck watching reruns of your boring human routine for years. At least now we’ve got some action.

Is there any wear OS health app you can recommend that does that well?

Chapter 1 

Five years into my marriage, I had told the story thirty–three times, how I’d lost the hearing in my left ear while saving Tristan Royston’s life. 

Yet every time I tilted my head to catch what someone was saying, he looked at me like I was doing 

it on purpose. 

“Why do you always tilt your head and play cute?” he snapped. “Can you be normal for once?” 

He even complained to his friends, “My wife’s always putting on this cutesy act. I tell her to stop, and she never listens.” 

Then, at the company’s Fourth of July reception, he reached up and took his assistant Natalia’s earring off. 

He reminded her gently, “Your piercing got infected a few days ago. Give it a break, stop wearing 

these for now.” 

He could remember her inflamed piercing like it mattered. 

But the habit I’d built after going half–deaf saving him, he “forgot” whenever it was convenient. 

So my sacrifice had never been a sacrifice to him. In his eyes, it was just me “trying to play cute.” 

I drifted out of the ballroom like I’d lost my soul, and my shoulder slammed into two men who reeked of alcohol. 

One of them clamped down on my wrist, hard, while the other raked his leering eyes over me. 

“You’re practically coming on to us,” he sneered. “And you still have the nerve to play the innocent?” 

I fought to pull free, and without thinking, I tilted my head, trying to hear them clearly. 

That tiny movement made them burst out laughing. “So you’re being all coy now?” one of them jeered. “Playing hard to get?” 

They yanked me toward the exit. 

My heart seized as I scanned the room, and I saw Tristan walking this way with Natalia tucked close, like he was shielding her from the world. 

Chapter 1 

0.87% 

I screamed with everything I had, “Tristan, help me!” 

Tristan did step in front of us, but Natalia cut in first, sweet as sugar. “Mr. Royston, I saw Fiona tilting her head and smiling at them earlier. They probably know each other.” 

Tristan’s face turned to ice. 

The men latched onto it instantly. “Yeah, yeah,” they said eagerly. “We know her!” 

I tried to explain, but a searing pain exploded across my cheek**,** making my vision blur. 

“Fiona,” Tristan snarled, his voice dripping. 

My cheek burned, and a metallic taste filled 

fury, “how long are you going to keep this up?” 

my mouth. 

By the time I lifted my head, Tristan already had his arm around Natalia and was walking away. 

Natalia glanced back, her body trembling as if she were innocent. “Mr. Royston… do you think Fiona will blame me? I’m so scared…”

Rage and humiliation flooded my chest, and I shouted at his back, “Tristan, if you walk away like this today, we’re getting divorced!”

Chapter 1 

Five years into my marriage, I had told the story thirty–three times, how I’d lost the hearing in my left ear while saving Tristan Royston’s life. 

Yet every time I tilted my head to catch what someone was saying, he looked at me like I was doing 

it on purpose. 

“Why do you always tilt your head and play cute?” he snapped. “Can you be normal for once?” 

He even complained to his friends, “My wife’s always putting on this cutesy act. I tell her to stop, and she never listens.” 

Then, at the company’s Fourth of July reception, he reached up and took his assistant Natalia’s earring off. 

He reminded her gently, “Your piercing got infected a few days ago. Give it a break, stop wearing 

these for now.” 

He could remember her inflamed piercing like it mattered. 

But the habit I’d built after going half–deaf saving him, he “forgot” whenever it was convenient. 

So my sacrifice had never been a sacrifice to him. In his eyes, it was just me “trying to play cute.” 

I drifted out of the ballroom like I’d lost my soul, and my shoulder slammed into two men who reeked of alcohol. 

One of them clamped down on my wrist, hard, while the other raked his leering eyes over me. 

“You’re practically coming on to us,” he sneered. “And you still have the nerve to play the innocent?” 

I fought to pull free, and without thinking, I tilted my head, trying to hear them clearly. 

That tiny movement made them burst out laughing. “So you’re being all coy now?” one of them jeered. “Playing hard to get?” 

They yanked me toward the exit. 

My heart seized as I scanned the room, and I saw Tristan walking this way with Natalia tucked close, like he was shielding her from the world.

Tristan’s face turned to ice. 

The men latched onto it instantly. “Yeah, yeah,” they said eagerly. “We know her!”

This time, with a bit of time off work for the holidays, I decided to try quitting again. I gave myself permission to have a cup of decaf each day and the occasional piece of chocolate, but my only rule was that I wouldn’t have fully-caffeinated soda, tea, or coffee. 

Last week, around week 5, I got an email to say that I was being laid off. I’m also losing the benefit of having my Masters degree covered by this employer, so there is more being lost than just employment.

I was initially disappointed and emotional about it, but I found that my mind wasn’t as focused or anxious about it like I would have been in the past. Coffee would make me fixate on problems and just spiral out of control, but now I feel like I’m able to be more practical about things. Yes, it sucks to lose my job, and I probably won’t be able to find something with the same salary, but I’m able to think through this situation now and keep it in perspective. Maybe this is just a push in a different direction for my life and career. I don’t need to overthink it or feel depressed about it. 

It takes time, and you might feel depressed, anxious, fatigued, apathetic, angry, or whatever other emotions your withdrawal makes you feel, but give it time. It will be worth it in the end.

I want to feel more alive within my career,"I’m working towards growing my business. It’s on a good steady growth pattern. It’s in a field that I can build a unique lifestyle and skillset. 

My “problem” is that it can feel flat at times and it is overly based on me and me alone. My day is pretty much mine to structure it as I want and if I want to work and grow it that’s my decision - there is no real team here counting on each other. 

In many ways, it’s the dream. I work from home mostly. I get to make a great breakfast. I play a game of sudoku with my coffee. I water the plants, fiddle around the house here and there. I can do as I wish and make moves where I see necessary for the business. If I want to go somewhere and travel, I don’t have to put in PTO or ask anyone for permission. Sure, the business isn’t making a ton of money by any means, but it’s getting me by. 

Why do I still get hung up on some idea of something better out there? Something where I’m needed and there’s stress and I’ve got to be somewhere and show up for someone/team. Where at the end of the day you may be beat but you’ve also got a high because you got through and conquered the day and now you can go enjoy your home. 

For instance, I’m watching The Bear right now and it’s utterly chaotic. I don’t think kitchen life would be this fantasy I’m alluding to haha but there’s something about it that’s alive!

I feel like the answer is to focus and dig deeper into my business, grow it into something very successful, and make it more of what I want but I keep finding ways to just be distracted and do busy work rather than really push it forward. 

And then I daydream about some other fantasy career that must be out there where every day I feel like I’ve been used up but in the best way possible. 

I’ve worked several office jobs and I know that’s not it for me. 

Am I just a total brat playing the grass is greener game? I’d really like to stop if so…

\- Throw it with light wash jeans + a plain navy hoodie (under a beige puffer) → casual winter streetwear.

\- Dress it down with khaki chinos + a white oversized tee (layered under a denim jacket) → weekend coffee run vibe.

\- Even works with black cargo pants + a neutral crewneck if you want edge without overdoing it.



The details (the subtle stitching, the Fragment logo hits) make it feel premium but not flashy—perfect for flexing \*without\* screaming “I spent too much.”

1q5bvcb,https://i.redd.it/umqinymlfobg1.png,I tried quitting a hundred times. I succeeded on the 101st. Never stop trying.,"Soon it will be **3 years since I completely quit smoking (cold turkey)**. Before that, I had smoked quite heavily for about **6 years**, around **1.5 packs a day on average**.

**What helped:**

**Get rid of anything that reminds you of smoking (at least temporarily).**

For me, this was mainly **coffee**, so I was fighting two battles at the same time, nicotine and caffeine. I only started drinking coffee again a few months later, once I was confident that it would not automatically pull me back into smoking.

**Social groups matter a lot.**

For me, social groups were a major factor in my smoking. Distancing myself from people who smoked a lot helped more than I expected. I know this is not an easy thing to do, and in my case it was not even really a choice. I moved abroad and had to rebuild my entire social circle from scratch. Because of that, I completely understand that this approach may not be realistic or applicable for everyone.

**Exercise and momentum.**

During my weight loss journey, I realized that when I exercise, I do not feel like overeating because it would undo the effort I already put in. I believe the same logic applies to smoking. I really like the compounding effect. When you exercise, eat well, and do not smoke, your overall health improves very fast. It feels incredibly good to notice your body recovering at such a high rate, and at that point you simply do not want to get in the way of that progress. You have to **create momentum**. Once you do that, even if cravings show up, they are usually not strong enough to stop it once it is rolling.

  
And most importantly, **keep trying.**

  
I have failed an embarrassing number of times. Do not forget that you have an endless number of attempts, and you only need one win.

I’m on a mission to collect cool people like Pokémon — except you don’t have to live in a ball, just maybe answer this post.

I’m looking for new connections anywhere in the world. BUT if you’re in NRW / around Düsseldorf, you get a shiny sticker and higher chances of spontaneous “let’s actually meet up like real adults” plans.

A bit about me:
	•	I love cooking (I will absolutely try to feed you at some point — consider this a warning)
	•	I run a lot (for fun, not because I’m being chased… usually)
	•	I’m into art + photography (street photos, vibes, aesthetics, the whole “wow that light is perfect” thing)
	•	I’m generally active — walks, exploring, trying new stuff, anything that gets me out of the “same couch, same scroll” loop

What I’m looking for:
	•	People who can hold a conversation beyond “haha yes”
	•	Locals for coffee, photowalks, a run, cooking sessions, random city adventures
	•	Online friends from anywhere who are up for chatting and maybe meeting if paths cross someday

If any of this sounds like your kind of chaos, send me a message with:
	1.	Where you’re from
	2.	Your top 3 hobbies (bonus points if one is weird)
	3.	The last thing you did that made you think: “Okay, that was actually a good day.”

Some of you reached out to me with your own stories, that made me feel heard and not alone and I appreciate all of you for speaking up against it.

Special thanks to the mods for removing bad comments and blocking such people from the community.

Now I would like to address some of the most repeated criticisms here -:

• “You cooked for him and then went to the beach with him, that’s why he thought you want to sleep with him”

I had cooked for him and others countless times before, none of them (including him) ever pulled this s\*it. If I want to sleep with someone, i would ask them directly.

Cooking = sexual interest is a bs logic

• “ Men and women cannot be friends “

I don’t think i am the only one with healthy friendships with the opposite gender. Just because of one isolated incident, i am not going to stop befriending, or cut off per se, my other male friends.

• “Going to any place alone with someone means sexual interest in Japan “

So what!? Aren’t we supposed to fight back against this culture? This is victim blaming at the finest. A lot of you said Japanese women avoid going for a coffee or karaoke etc alone with a guy because it is interpreted as sexual interest. That’s shifting the entire blame onto the women in the name of “culture “. Again if someone wants to sleep with their friend, they should ask for consent first, instead of sliding their hands down your pants.

I am really concerned about the type of foreigners who are moving to Japan, and supporting this misogynistic behavior.

1q5bouy,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1q5bouy/itutuloy_ko_ba_relationship_namin/,Itutuloy ko ba relationship namin?,"Problem/Goal: me and this guy (both 27) is on break (you can call it cool off maybe) dahil ang gulo niya. Ako ang first girlfriend niya. We were friends for almost 3 years before being in a relationship. He had side funs (with men) within the first 1 1/2 year ng friendship namin. Naging kami last July but it’s messy and ang gulo niya but said he really loves me.

Context: so I met a guy online last 2022. We vibed and became friends. He is a pretty boy. Very nonchalant siya and wala masyadong friends. I was a work from home girly and hindi talaga lumalabas so I figured why not have someone who drags me out to go places.

Naging super close kami and after almost a month of talking online, we met. He is really good looking but l theres something in him that screams na di siya straight. I talked to him about that and he said nga na he is doing side funs (no penetration) with men and ‘receiver’ lang daw siya. I didn’t mind since we’re friends nga. I even support him with it. Help him monitor yung prep niya and remind him or schedule him to have STD/HIV tests. I was also going out on dates from time to time with guys na nirereto ng mom/lola ko or reto from friends.

Umabot sa point na after work namin, lagi na kaming magkasama and I go to his condo kasi mahilig kaming mag coffee around his area. We mainly talk about businesses since my family owns multiple businesses and isinasama ko rin siya sa mga meetings ko. We had a lot of travels outside the metro and madami siyang First experiences with me. Kasama ko rin siya maghanap ng properties and went to few oculars with him. He actually helped me choose one of the properties I acquired and I can say na that unit is really dear to both of us.

Things started to change when suddenly, he got mad at me for installing bumble. I didn’t think much about it and was actively swiping. Had a few meetups too. There was a time na nasa trip kami sa North and he asked me to delete bumble, stop dating other men and he would also ‘behave’ na and won’t do side funs anymore. 

We continued with our setup. Lagi pa rin kami nagkikita after work and we’re always together every off. He was giving me all the motives but was never clear about it. Yun din actually nagiging reason ng arguments namin before since may mga times na I would go out on dates and magagalit siya pag nalaman niya but when I ask why is he mad and ano ba kami, he just tells me I am someone SPECIAL to him. 

He said he was trying to figure out things pa and he was never in a relationship that’s why he couldn’t go all out on me. He basically said he was scared he would fuck it up and ruin our friendship. That went on for another year (and during this period, we started having sex na din). He’s certain he has feelings for me and I know I have feelings for him too.  But the problem is I came to a point where was having existential crisis and was feeling pressured since I’m getting older and couldn’t settle yet.

We sat down and talked about things. We said we would give it a shot, hence the relationship. It was okay naman. He brought  me home and officially introduced me to his family as his girlfriend and I did the same. Everything was fine naman up until lagi kaming nagaaway because I feel like as a boyfriend, he was somehow neglectful in a way na gusto niya yung mga gusto niya lang nasusunod and I do all the compromise.

I don’t know but I got sad and felt like it made me miserable since he wasn’t listening whenever I discussed what hurt me, what he needs to do, what I want and what I don’t.  One day nasa condo niya kami and nag away because of his coworker and because he has this habit of eating on his own as soon as  nakaluto na siya. 

He didn’t bother getting me a plate and didn’t bother offering me food. He was at the table eating lang. i was pissed and hurt. Idk but hindi kasi ganun sa family namin and ilang ulit ko na yung sinabi sa kanya na I feel disrespected and neglected whenever he’s doing that. I left his condo and blocked him shortly after that. He tried to reach out and was also contacting my mom. 

It’s been 3 months and nagusap lang kami this new year. He said he realized all his mistakes and was apologetic. He said  he’s only seeing himself with me and only wants his future with me. He’s showing naman na he changed and is a lot mature now. But I still don’t know if I should continue the relationship or cut him off completely.

1q5bo6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q5bo6e/college_sweethearts_avoidant_discards_me_im/,College Sweethearts: Avoidant discards me & I’m heartbroken,"Two months ago, my girlfriend of three years broke up with me. We’re both young—she’s 21, I’m 23—but I genuinely believed she was the one.

We met in college when she was 18 and I was 20. For most of 2024, we were long distance while she finished her final year across the country. The distance was brutal. Our intimacy evaporated, made worse by a serious health issue she dealt with during the three months we had together last summer. Instead of reconnecting, those months became a dead zone—though I was there for her through all of it.

As her graduation approached this past fall, my worst fear materialized: I could feel her pulling away. The uncertainty was killing me. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep—it was affecting every aspect of my life, not knowing whether the woman I’d spent three years loving even wanted me anymore. I got anxious and, honestly, I smothered her. She basically told me I was emotionally exhausting, that she felt pressured to fit into my established post-grad life like a puzzle piece. She said her entire adult identity had been built around me, and that freaked her out. Her expression of doubt shattered me, but honestly, was very valid.

When I visited during her last weeks at school, I knew it was over. I just couldn’t get myself to break up with her. I even called my good friend, he told me to get my ass home. I didn’t, we celebrated our 3 years. She said that our relationship deserved a fighting chance. A week later she called me in tears & dumped me. We met up in person & hashed it out shortly after - she was stone cold sound in her decision.

I guess we  both needed things the other couldn’t give. She needed space to figure out who she is outside of us. I needed reassurance she wanted to be with me. And truthfully, I’d gotten too comfortable—coasting in my personal life, not chasing my goals.

When she ended things, she said she doesn’t think our story is finished. That I’m her dream partner, that perhaps one day we could still
Get married. She can’t give me a timeline. We’re doing monthly calls now, and she’s moving to my city soon for work, but she made it clear that doesn’t mean we’ll get back together. We are to meet for coffee, something she wants to do.

Part of me completely understands. This woman was my best friend, the only person who truly knows me. If we’re ever going to work, we both need to grow into different people first. The other part of me is shattered.

I’m doing what I’m supposed to do—traveling, excelling at work, hitting the gym, going on casual dates. I don’t want to put my life on hold. But I also can’t shake the belief in what we had.

Against your better judgement, you make a face like what's even this vegan casserole even made of? and with another little *hmf* she packs up her book and what's left of her tea and she leaves the room. You wouldn't call this storming, just yet--some heavy raining, maybe--just she walks away with sudden purpose and you take a bite or two of whatever this even is and figure you're allowed to follow. *Mmmm*, you say. Into the living room you say it. *Mmmm* and find her folding her legs up on the couch and unresponsive with her tea. *That sure was tasty*, you say, and you turn on the TV and sit next to her and with another--yep--with another predictable *hmf!* she packs right back up and leaves the room again. And here you are and so you remain, here, on the couch. Still taking all of this in and talking to yourself. Out loud like a crazy person. Or not, because she can still heeeear you and you know it, by the way. Because you can hear her, too, that sound her chair just made across the kitchen floor, and you suspect! louder now, you suspect this wasn't an accident, was it! She wants to be heard, it turns out. huffing and puffing and pulling out chairs. That she didn't go upstairs, yet, is the point of the chair sound. She wants to be followed, again. But not this time! You're done with all that! You've had a long day! You want a little peace and quiet and maybe some real cheese?? if that's not crazy? Let alone a piece of meat for Pete's sake--oh! And what was that? Perchance did a chair just squeak again? Into the living room is she storming? Your silent cranky mouthless herbivoric fiance? No? Upstairs then? finally? Yep. There she goes. The storm of the century has finally arrived, folks. All of that stomping and storming up the stairs you anticipated all along. All day long you worked and worried how you'd get out of this rabbit food supper and only to come home to what? To this! An attitude! Well forget it! Maybe you WILL go to the strip club tonight! If only for the hot wings and maybe you--ahh, more sudden storming sounds. Haunting. Anticipation brews! More and louder careful-not-to-fall-down-the-stairs-but-still-storming sounds, and here she is. Arms crossed like any of this is your fault, when it isn't. Well fine, maybe that bit about the strippers crossed a line, but you mean at least you say what's on your mind? Or would she prefer you both get the silent treatment? Yes? Well tough luck. You're not built that way. You're not as expressive in the *face*. You can't communicate with just your FACE the way she can. What's that, face? Does she want your feet off the coffee table? Fine. The TV off? Fine. Was that so hard? Shove over? Sure. As she wishes. You sit up to give her the comfy corner of the couch which mind you both of you prefer, mind you. Is she happy now? Is that what face is saying? These little spats sure would finish faster if she used her words, by the way. And wow, somehow this gets a smooch. Somehow. Who even knows. The mind of your woman remains a complete mystery to you, but the crisis has been averted, it seems. And now to be honest you're wondering if a pizza isn't out of the question. You mean you could compromise, put some mushrooms on it. Grass, for all you care, so long as there's a pepperoni or two. Face says no. Face isn't happy with this idea. Face threatens more stormy weather over meat talk--well fine. No pepperoni. Have it her way. At this point you'll settle for real cheese. Deal? Deal. Hooray. And yes, you get the hint already.

1q5bmbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1q5bmbf/i_am_33f_and_husband_is_35m_can_a_marriage_be/,I am 33F and husband is 35M. Can a marriage be stable and feel like a compromise?,"I’m 33F, married to my husband (35M), and I’m asking this with a lot of honesty.



This is an arranged marriage—not forced. We met in India for a couple of coffee dates, then spent three days together in London. During that time, he felt like exactly what I wanted—present, warm, emotionally available. I chose him deliberately.



Early in our marriage, I was very clear that I wanted two kids and that I was ready to start a family. Around that time, our sex life began to fall apart. Intimacy became infrequent, awkward, and mostly initiated by me. Over the years, it never really recovered.



I’ve spoken to him about this multiple times—openly and directly. I’ve explained how important emotional and physical intimacy are to me, and how lonely it feels to always initiate. He listens and acknowledges it, but nothing meaningfully changes long-term.



Six years later, we now have an 8-month-old baby through IUI. The reason for IUI was not fertility issues, but ongoing sexual incompatibility. Even now, intimacy remains strained and one-sided.



My husband is a genuinely good soul—kind, ethical, dependable. He is a good partner in practical ways and a good father. I respect him deeply.



But our relationship feels passionless.



Emotionally, it often feels platonic. Physically, desire feels muted and obligatory. I’m a deep, emotionally intense person who craves connection—both emotional and physical. He isn’t wired that way, and trying to bridge that gap often feels like I’m alone in wanting it.



For context, before marriage I dated someone who was emotionally volatile and narcissistic. He oscillated between extreme idealization and devaluation—calling me “an angel” one moment and “a bitch” the next. It was unhealthy and destabilizing, and I don’t romanticize it. But the intensity and passion in that relationship were very real.



Because of that history, I sometimes wonder whether my nervous system learned to associate intensity with love—and whether stability now feels flat by comparison. At the same time, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to want desire, intimacy, and mutual initiation in a marriage.



That’s where I’m stuck.



One practical question I’m dealing with right now: my husband and I are meeting each other again after about 45 days apart, and we’ll be staying with his parents. I’ve realized I don’t want to be the one initiating intimacy this time, since that’s been the pattern for years. I’m not trying to punish or manipulate—just trying to step out of that dynamic and see what happens.



For those who’ve been in similar situations:



* Is it reasonable to stop initiating without making it a “thing”?
* How do you handle this when staying with parents, where intimacy is already constrained?
* Is it better to let things unfold naturally, or to try to intentionally push intimacy during a reunion like this?





What I’m ultimately struggling with:



* Is passion something that naturally fades in marriage, or something that was never really there?
* Do people accept marriages where intimacy exists mostly out of effort, not desire?
* How do you distinguish healthy calm from emotional emptiness?
* How do you tell the difference between maturity and quiet resignation?





I’m not looking to leave, cheat, or blame my husband. I chose this marriage consciously, and I own that. But I don’t know whether living long-term without passion—emotionally and physically—is something people adapt to, or something they regret not addressing sooner.



I’d really appreciate honest perspectives, especially from people in arranged marriages, long-term marriages, or those who’ve navigated sexual incompatibility and emotionally intense past relationships.

My husband is aware and usually supportive.

We attended a family party last weekend. Nothing crazy just my husband's cousins, a couple friends and parents. We all got together to watch a hockey game and play cards. 

I had been feeling anxious before the party and my husband asked if I wanted to stay home but I didn't want to miss out and I was worried his family would think I'm a shut-in so I went.

Everything was fine and I was having fun. I had my drink on a low coffee table and their dog came in from outside and ran up and knocked my drink over onto the carpet. I helped clean it up but immediately I couldn't help the spiraling negative thoughts- ""I'm not gonna be invited over anymore, I spilled a drink on their carpet. Everybody already thinks I'm weird and antisocial, I have to keep it together""

It felt like I couldn't breathe and I asked my husband if we could leave. He wanted to stay longer so I went in the bathroom and started crying and then I just couldn't stop. People came to check on me and I was sooooooo embarrassed and then my husband saw I was crying and took me home.

I woke up to a bunch of texts the next day from people asking if I was ok. I'm sure these people just genuinely care and they're concerned but I don't know how to tell all these family and friends that the reason I was openly sobbing was because of a spilled drink. My husband is also disappointed and says he wishes I would have just stayed home.

The fresh capital will be used to expand the product portfolio and accelerate the brand’s reach into new markets in India and abroad.

The deal also includes stake acquisitions from existing investors Premji Invest and TPG NewQuest. According to reports, Apax Partners will invest around ₹1,300 Cr ($144 Mn) for a 25% stake, valuing iD Fresh at approximately ₹4,500 Cr.

Founded in 2005 by Musthafa and his four cousins, iD Fresh built its reputation on idli and dosa batters, before expanding into frozen Indian flatbreads, pancake and coffee mixes, and dairy products like curd and paneer.
After years of growth and investment, the company turned profitable in FY24, posting a net profit of ₹1.84 Cr, up from a loss of ₹23.3 Cr in FY23. Its profit before tax (PBT) surged to ₹26.7 Cr in FY25, with revenue climbing 22% to ₹688.22 Cr.

A key driver of profitability has been diversification beyond batters and an omnichannel distribution strategy spanning general trade, modern retail, e-commerce, and quick commerce—helping iD Fresh reach more cities and maintain its competitive edge in short shelf-life products.

This milestone underscores the brand’s strong execution, innovative product portfolio, and scalable growth strategy, and marks a significant step forward in iD Fresh’s ambition to become a national and global leader in ready-to-cook foods.",1,1767682418.0,u_abhaymishr0,0,1.0,False

The relocation is required for a promotion my husband had worked his whole career to get.

We currently live in a really walkable part of LA with access to lots of parks, a really nice “town center” with dozens of great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops, and we walk our kids (age 6 and 9) to school every day. The school is solid and the community is outstanding. We got really lucky when we bought our house, which was and still is my dream home.

I love love love Chicago, but we decided to move to the suburbs for the schools and so that we can have a nice wide lot with a nice backyard — it felt too much to uproot our kids and take away those things that they’re used to here. But I’m really having second thoughts leaving our life here, and I’d love to hear from other people who have relocated from LA or SoCal area to the Chicago burbs.

What has your experience been like? Do you regret moving? Or do you love it so much you haven’t looked back? Do you have any advice for us?

1q5bhuc,https://i.redd.it/mar7wpfwdobg1.png,Warning to those using LAN,"Recently, my girlfriend and I have started to play TFC, and we've run into MAJOR issues. Now, I may delve deeper into those issues in a future post, but to rush out a PSA, I wanted to make this post as the most prevalent issue we ran into was with the KubeJS mod.   
  
I am on Windows, and my girlfriend is using her MacBook.   
  
Now, we haven't fully gotten the LAN to work yet, though she was able to briefly join my world, so I guess that's better than nothing.   
  
The issue we ran into along the way (besides the endless networking issues) was that upon attempting to load into my world, she would receive an error message that stated her KubeJS was not the same version as mine. (I will attach an image relating to this.)   
Because the game takes 12 years (approx. 15 minutes) to load on her device, I had her send me her version of the KubeJS folder found in the main folder for the profile of the modpack to fix the inconsistencies. Doing so ended up breaking a few things in my game. I wasn't able to chop wood, nor was boiled (or boiling) water a thing at all. Seriously, my backpack was completely emptied of all its water.   
  
Considering I didn't want to deal with drinking unclean water for the rest of my playthrough, I decided to back up my world file (move it to a temporary folder) and delete the profile (then move the world back into the new modpack installation). This fixed the issues, but it also caused my map and waypoints to be completely deleted.   
  
I assume this can be fixed by properly backing this data up, but to save my fellow players from a bit of headache, just beware of what you do with the KubeJS folder. 

Currently, I am still trying to fix our LAN connection and have the game function properly with both of us playing. 

PS. Can I just say how frustrating it is that I can't download the server pack? I get the modder wants to make money off the pack somehow, but for the love of God, just let me buy you a coffee or something instead. Seriously, this modpack is really fun, but it's very annoying that I can't just make a server as I do with all the other modpacks I use.

Ever feel like you're hustling 24/7 but your bank account isn’t reflecting the grind? Yeah, me too. That’s why I’ve been diving deep into AI-powered passive income streams—and let me tell you, the future is *now*. In 2026, AI isn’t just a buzzword; it’s your side hustle’s new best friend. Here are **three actionable ways** to turn AI into a money-making machine while you sleep (or binge-watch your favorite show 🍿).

---

### **1. AI-Generated Niche Blogs (The “Set It & Forget It” Goldmine)**
Remember when blogging meant staring at a blank screen for hours? **Not anymore.** Tools like Jasper, SurferSEO, and even free AI writers can crank out hyper-targeted, SEO-optimized posts in minutes. Here’s how to make it work:
- **Pick a micro-niche** (think “eco-friendly cat toys” or “budget VR gaming setups”).
- **Train your AI** with a few high-ranking articles as examples—give it your tone, keywords, and structure.
- **Automate posting** via WordPress plugins or Ghost (schedule 3-5 posts/week).
- **Monetize** with affiliate links (Amazon Associates, ShareASale) or ads (Ezoic, Mediavine).

*Pro tip:* Use AI to repurpose old posts into TikTok scripts or Twitter threads. **Double the content, half the work.**

---

### **2. AI-Powered YouTube Shorts/TikTok Clips (Viral Loops on Autopilot)**
Short-form video isn’t slowing down—it’s *evolving*. AI tools like Pictory, Synthesia, and even CapCut’s auto-captioning can turn **any** content into engaging clips. Here’s the playbook:
- **Scrape trending sounds/topics** with tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ.
- **Use AI to edit** (e.g., auto-cut silences, add captions, or generate voiceovers).
- **Repurpose long-form content** (turn a blog post into 3-5 Shorts with AI summaries).
- **Post daily** (consistency > perfection) and let AI handle the heavy lifting.

*Bonus:* Use AI to analyze your top-performing clips and **clone the formula** for endless variations.

---

### **3. AI-Curated Newsletters (The “Lazy” Influencer Hack)**
Newsletters are back, baby—and AI is the ultimate wingman. Platforms like Beehiiv or ConvertKit + AI tools (like Copy.ai or Notion AI) can turn you into a **one-person media empire**. Steps:
- **Pick a niche** (e.g., “AI tools for solopreneurs” or “underrated travel hacks”).
- **Use AI to curate** (feed it RSS feeds, Twitter threads, or Reddit posts to summarize).
- **Add your personality** (a quick intro/outro keeps it human).
- **Monetize** with sponsorships (once you hit 1K subs) or digital products (e.g., Notion templates).

*Secret sauce:* Let AI **A/B test subject lines** to boost open rates while you sip coffee.

---

**Final thought:** The key to passive income? **Start small, automate fast, and scale smart.** AI’s the tool, but *you’re* the strategist.

*(P.S. If you’re curious about other passive income hacks, I recently stumbled on a community focused on automated reselling—apparently, they guarantee 10x ROI with daily secret deal alerts. I’m testing it out, and if you wanna peek, here’s my affiliate link: [https://clipwise.ai/?utm_source=affiliate&linkId=lp_603470&sourceId=liveitup-deals&tenantId=clipwise&affS1=reddit].

I mean, I get it—shorts are viral, easy to digest, low effort, blah blah blah. But is it actually profitable, or am I just living in the dream world of online money-making content?

You perform a Google search for a highly competitive term. You expect to see the usual suspects dominating the top spots: Amazon, Wikipedia, Forbes, or perhaps a massive industry retailer with a marketing budget that dwarfs your annual revenue. But then, you see something unexpected.

Sitting comfortably in position one is a website you have never heard of. It’s a niche blog or a small startup’s landing page. It doesn't have the domain age of the giants, and if you ran it through an SEO tool, its Domain Authority (DA) would likely look underwhelming compared to the competitors below it.

This isn’t a glitch in the algorithm. It is a feature of how modern search engines prioritize value over volume.

For small business owners and content marketers, this phenomenon is the ultimate beacon of hope. It proves that SEO is not a ""pay-to-win"" environment where the deepest pockets always secure the most visibility. While big brands have the advantage of accumulated trust, they often suffer from dilution and lack of focus. Understanding why *small sites outrank big brands* requires shifting your mindset from chasing vanity metrics like DA to understanding how Google actually evaluates relevance, intent, and authority on a granular level.

# The Myth of Domain Authority Dominance

To understand how a David can beat a Goliath in the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs), we first have to dismantle a pervasive myth: that Google uses ""Domain Authority"" as a ranking factor.

Domain Authority (DA), and similar metrics like Domain Rating (DR), are third-party scores developed by software companies like Moz and Ahrefs. They are useful predictive tools that estimate a website's ability to rank based on its backlink profile. However, Google has stated repeatedly that they do not use a sitewide authority score to rank pages.

Google ranks *web pages*, not *websites*.

While a high-authority domain can pass ""link juice"" to its internal pages, giving them a head start, it does not guarantee a ranking. A specific page on a low-DA site that is perfectly optimized, highly relevant, and expertly written can absolutely outperform a mediocre page on a high-DA site. This distinction is where the opportunity lies.

# Topical Authority: The Specialist vs. The Generalist

Big brands are often generalists. A massive e-commerce giant sells everything from lawnmowers to lipstick. A major news outlet covers global politics, celebrity gossip, and tech reviews. While they have a wide reach, their expertise is diluted across thousands of different topics.

Google’s algorithms, particularly after updates like BERT and the Helpful Content Update, place a massive premium on **Topical Authority**.

Topical authority is a measure of a site’s depth of expertise in a specific subject area. When a small site dedicates its entire existence to a single niche—say, ""ergonomic setups for remote developers""—it signals to Google that it is a subject matter expert.

# How Topical Relevance SEO Works

When a search engine crawls a massive retail site, it sees a disorganized cluster of keywords. When it crawls a niche site, it sees a semantic web of related concepts.

For example, if you run a small coffee blog, you don't just have a page about ""coffee beans."" You have pages about:

* The difference between Arabica and Robusta.
* The impact of altitude on bean density.
* Specific brewing temperatures for Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.

Because your content covers the entire ""entity"" of coffee, Google trusts your site more for coffee-related queries than a lifestyle magazine that publishes one article about coffee every six months. This is *topical relevance SEO* in action. The algorithm recognizes that your site provides the most comprehensive answer, regardless of your brand size.

# Intent Matching: Answering the Question vs. Selling the Product

One of the most common reasons small sites outrank big brands is simply that they understand the user better. Large enterprises often suffer from a disconnect between their SEO teams and their content strategy, leading to pages that are optimized for keywords but fail to satisfy user intent.

Consider a search query like ""how to fix a leaky faucet.""

* **The Big Brand Approach:** A massive hardware retailer ranks for this because they sell wrenches and washers. Their page is a product category page listing 50 different tools.
* **The Small Site Approach:** A local plumber or a DIY blog writes a step-by-step guide with photos, a video tutorial, and a troubleshooting FAQ.

The user does not want to buy a wrench yet; they want to learn how to fix the leak. The hardware store failed to match the *informational intent* of the searcher, attempting to force a *transactional* experience. The small blog met the user exactly where they were.

Google tracks user interaction signals. If users click the big brand link, realize it’s just a product list, and bounce back to the search results, that signals dissatisfaction. If they click the small blog and stay for five minutes reading the guide, that signals relevance. Over time, the small site rises.

# Page-Level SEO: The Granular Battlefield

Because Google ranks pages rather than sites, the battle for the top spot is fought on a page-by-page basis. This levels the playing field significantly.

A large corporation might have millions of backlinks pointing to its homepage, but its specific sub-page about ""enterprise software integration"" might be buried five clicks deep in the site architecture, with poor internal linking and outdated content.

A startup, on the other hand, can create a ""Power Page"" on that exact topic. They can execute superior *page-level SEO* by:

* \*\* optimizing the URL structure\*\* (e.g., /software-integration-guide vs. /products/cat-ID-8839).
* **Updating the content regularly** to ensure freshness, something big sites struggle to do at scale.
* **Building specific backlinks** directly to that article from other niche-relevant sites.

When the algorithm compares the two specific URLs, the startup’s page looks stronger, more relevant, and more authoritative *for that specific query*, even if the big brand’s homepage is more famous.

# SEO as a Compounding Asset, Not a Linear Input

Many large organizations view SEO as a linear input: if we publish X number of pages, we get Y amount of traffic. They treat content like a commodity. This approach leaves a vulnerability that smaller, more agile competitors can exploit.

Successful smaller sites view SEO as a compounding asset. They understand that content, links, and trust signals reinforce each other over time.

# The Flywheel Effect

1. **High-Value Content:** You create a resource that is significantly better than what the big brands offer (because they can't justify the cost of creating ""10x content"" for a niche keyword).
2. **Earned Links:** Because your resource is the best, other sites link to it naturally. You don't need a massive PR budget; you just need to be the most useful reference in the room.
3. **Increased Trust:** These links tell Google your page is trustworthy.
4. **Higher Rankings:** You take the #1 spot.
5. **More Visibility = More Links:** Being at #1 naturally attracts more links from people doing research, which further cements your position.

Big brands often struggle to get this flywheel spinning for specific topics because they are bogged down by bureaucracy. Approval processes for content can take weeks. Technical changes to the website might take months to get through the development queue. A small site owner can update a title tag or add a paragraph of new information in five minutes. This agility allows small sites to compound their wins while big brands are still scheduling the meeting to discuss the strategy.

# The Technical Advantage: Speed and Experience

It is ironic that companies with the biggest budgets often have the worst websites from a technical standpoint. Enterprise websites are frequently plagued by ""code bloat."" They are weighed down by:

* Legacy code from previous site versions.
* Dozens of third-party tracking scripts and marketing pixels.
* Unoptimized, heavy images uploaded by various departments.
* Intrusive pop-ups and legal compliance banners.

These factors hurt Core Web Vitals—Google’s metrics for user experience (loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability).

A small site can run on a lightweight framework. It can be razor-fast, mobile-responsive, and free of clutter. Since the Page Experience update, Google has made it clear that if two pages have similar content relevance, the one with the better user experience will win. This is a massive tactical advantage for lean, small websites.

# Focus and Depth Beat Scale

The final reason small sites win is simply focus.

If you are a big brand, you likely care about ""head terms""—the high-volume keywords that drive massive traffic. You might focus on ranking for ""insurance.""

A small site cannot compete for ""insurance."" But they don't need to. They can compete for ""professional liability insurance for freelance graphic designers in California.""

By narrowing the focus, the small site can create content with a depth that the big brand cannot replicate at scale. To the big brand, that specific long-tail keyword is a rounding error. To the small business, it is a highly qualified revenue stream.

Google rewards this depth. The search engine wants to send users to the best possible resource. Often, the best resource isn't the one with the biggest logo, but the one written by a passionate expert who covered every angle of the topic.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# How do small sites outrank big brands?

Small sites outrank big brands by focusing on topical authority, user intent, and agility. By becoming the absolute expert in a specific niche, creating content that answers questions better than generic corporate pages, and ensuring a fast, clean user experience, small sites can beat giants on specific search queries.

# Does brand size matter for SEO?

Brand size matters, but it is not the only factor. Big brands often have high ""Domain Authority"" and natural trust, which gives them a head start. However, they often suffer from technical bloat and diluted content focus. Google ranks pages based on relevance and quality, not just the size of the company behind them.

# Can startups compete with big companies in SEO?

Yes, startups can absolutely compete, provided they don't try to fight on the big company's terms. Startups should avoid broad, high-volume keywords initially and instead focus on long-tail keywords, specific questions, and niche topics where they can demonstrate superior expertise and depth.

# Why does Google rank smaller websites higher?

Google ranks smaller websites higher when those sites provide a better answer to the user's search query. If a small site has a dedicated, deeply researched article on a topic, and the big brand only has a thin product page, Google’s algorithm is designed to prioritize the helpful content on the small site.

# The Opportunity Is Wide Open

The search landscape is more democratic than it appears. While it can be intimidating to see household names dominating the top of the search results, remember that their armor has chinks. They are slow, they are generalists, and they often prioritize transaction over information.

By doubling down on *page-level SEO*, building immense *topical relevance*, and treating your content as a compounding asset, you can carve out a significant share of traffic.

After plenty of research, I decided a Moccamaster KBGV was what we needed in our kitchen. 

I was so excited to find a great price on one from a reputable source during Cyber Monday. I got it relatively fast and the shipping box was in near perfect condition. I wrapped it up nicely, put a little bow on it, and labeled it to us “from Santa”.

We open it up on Christmas morning, start unpacking it, and immediately notice the hot plate is damaged. Such a bummer. Called the company for a replacement, and they’re backordered until March—so now we are stuck with our leaky Mr. Coffee for a few months waiting on the exchange. 

With the hype around it being a handmade product and a brewer of the best coffee, I’m surprised to see that this issue is so common. I’m hoping Moccamaster or Technivorm sees this post (and the so many others) and puts a little more care into the production and safe packaging of the hot plate.

I sure hope it does not have a bunch of teenage girls. I don't need that kind of shit, and neither do my members. I watched as a woman and for boys all well over 6 feet, 4 inches or more tall got out of the cars. Then I noticed the Indian motorcycle pulled up and parked behind a truck.

My VP and I watched as a small boy got off. Then our mouths dropped open. It was a girl whos hair flew down her back, past her hips as she took off her helmet. We heard one of the boys yell something and she ran over and jumped into his arms. She is short, very, short. But I am looking at the older woman. She has dark red hair that flows down her back to her hips. She is about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with long legs.

As we watched them walk around the property we heard the boys talking about how much land came with it. And there were two three car garages. And a huge metal building in the back. We sat watching to see what happened next. Sure enough the for sale sign was removed.

We watched as the older woman and one of the older boys got into the truck and headed to town. Just then the bigger boys grabbed the girl and started tossing her back and forth. We heard them yelling she had to agree to something. I heard her yell ""fuck you guys."" They stood her on her feet and crossed their arms. Looking down at her.

The started yelling at her and I laughed as she just stood there and glared at them. She showed no fear of them. ""Dam that little girl is a spitfire"" I said looking at my VP. My VP is a 24 year old man that loves pussy. My VP's name is Ripper. He looked at me laughing. ""She is a handful isn't she?"" The we really laughed as she walked away giving them the finger.

I was so pissed at my brothers. I just turned 18 and will graduate from high school this year. My brothers rang from 25,24,23,22, and 20. Ace is 25, Turk, is 24, Panther is 23, Racer is 22, and Fist is 20. Mom stopped having kids after I came along. My dad died in a bar fight trying to protect my mother.

My dad's brother is the president of the Wild Eagle MC. of Lima, Ohio. His name is Hunter. He told mom about this house. Mom sold our house and decided to move from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Celina, Ohio. I sit down on the porch and lit a joint.

I looked up and saw the moving truck pull into the driveway. I walked into the house and looked at all the bedrooms. I turned left at the top of the stairs. I walked down the hallway and opened the door. This is my room, it has its own bathroom.

""I opened the window and yelled down that they better pick their bedrooms because this one is mine.""

They can't argue with that because this one is purple. A girls room. I heard them running toward the room I was in. My brothers were yelling they want this one until they walked in and saw the walls are purple.

""Fuck that"" they said. They all turned and started looking around until they all had picked the rooms they wanted. My bed was up and the boxes stacked against the wall. I made my bed, then started hanging my clothes in the closet. Then I put them in the dresser.

My desk was against the wall next to the door. I had everything unpacked and turned my radio on. Then I climbed out my window and sat on he roof.

I looked up and saw her sitting on the roof. She couldn't be more than 18. I heard one of her brothers yelling at her to get off the roof. I caught my breath as she walked to the edge and looked down at him.

Granted it could not be more than 5 or 10 feet off the ground. But she could fall and hurt herself. Knight Rider MC

""Do you really want me off the roof Ace."" She asked.

""Get off before you fall.""

I watched as she sat on the edge of the roof. Then she jumped off.

""Fuck,"" I said standing up. Then I saw him catch her.

""Will you stop doing that Star.""

""One of these days you are gong to get hurt.""

I heard her laugh and my breath caught in my throat. It was beautiful. I saw another brother walk out on the porch and he said, ""Mom just called."" She is on her way home with groceries. She will need help unloading them.

She also said she had some news for us. We turned as mom pulled into the driveway and parked. We all started carrying groceries into the house. We started putting them away.

Turk asked. ""What is your news mom?""

""I got a job at the nursing home down the road.""

""I will be the nurse in charge and work the morning shift.""

""There is a nursing assistant position open on the second shift.""

""I brought you an application home, Star.""

""You can work after school. Here is the application."" I start in two days. I can take your application in when I go to work. I took it to my room, filled it out then gave it back to my mom.

""I am going to park my bike in the big shed out back. I said walking out the door. I walked over sat on my bike and started it. Then I started it and rode around the cars and trucks to the back yard.

I drove it into the building parked it, shut it off and got off walking out of the building. I walked over to my mustang and parked it in the garage. I then walked back into the house.

Chapter 2: Brandy

I am the mother of four boys and one daughter. I am a nurse and I just moved my family to Celina, Ohio. My husband was killed last year in a bar protecting me. I needed to move from Fort Wayne, Indiana. I moved to a nice town with a lake. It is not a big town but that is what I wanted for my kids. I moved across the street from the Knight Rider MC.

I heard a knock on the front door. I opened it large, tall man wearing a cut standing there. I opened the door and ""asked if I could help him.""

""I want to introduce myself. My name is Gunner and I am the president of the club across the street.""

""We are having a BBQ this weekend and would like to invite you and your family over. It starts at 7:00 pm.""

""My name is Brandy, Thank you, we will be there.""

I watched as he walked down the porch steps. That was nice of him. I told the boys were invited to the BBQ. Star is not home so I will tell her in the morning. I got home at 1:00 Am. Everyone was in bed. I walked into my room and put my money in a lock box. I made $25,000 tonight. I took a shower and went to bed. I have school in the morning.

I got up and dressed for school. I made me coffee and cereal. I put my bowl in the dishwasher before walking out and getting into my car. I drove to the high school and parked my car. I walked to the office and got my schedule. After school I walked to my car and drove home. Again no one was home when I walked in.

I made me a sandwich and coffee before I walked up stairs to my room where I changed into shorts and a tee-shirt. I ate my sandwich and drank my coffee before I completed my homework. We have been here almost a week now. Tomarrow is Saturday. I wonder what mom has planned.

It seems my brothers have all planned to stay at the club across the street. They are hardly at home anymore. I miss Panther. He moved to Florida a week ago. He is the president of his own MC now. I walked down stairs and saw my brothers in the living room.

""What are we all doing tomarrow?""

We don't know about you, but we have all been invited to a BBQ across the street.

""What do you mean, you don't know about me?""

""I wasn't invited?""

""Mom didn't mention you.""

""Oh, Ok,"" I said getting up and walking out the front door to sit on the porch. I felt a tear slide down my face. I was not invited to attend the BBQ. How could mom do that? It was not fair that I was not invited and they would go without me. I watched as mom and the boys started out the door.

I said. ""Mom how could you go over there when I was not invited.""

I than ran out the door got on my bike and drove out of the driveway and down the road.

""What did she mean by that Ace.""

""Well, you told us boys that you and we were invited.""

""You didn't mention Star, so we told her she was not invited.""

I drove to the restaurant in town and parked my bike. I saw a girl come out and get on her bike.

""Hey, didn't you move into the house across the street from our club?""

""Yes, why do you ask?""

""Aren't you coming to the BBQ?""

""I was not invited.""

""My brothers said that just them and my mom was.""

""That can't be right, my brother would not do that.""

""Well apparently he did."" I said turning and walking into the restaurant and ordered food. I looked out the window and saw it was getting dark so I got on my bike and rode home.

I saw them walk into the club but I did not see the girl. Where is she? Introductions were made and I asked.

""Where is your daughter?""

""She was not invited.""

""Wait, What?""

""Of course, she was.""

""Fuck."" I heard her brothers say.

""We didn't think she was because she is not 21.""

""Of course, she was invited. This is a family BBQ.""

""She left the house when we told hers she was not invited.""

I was pissed that Gunner did not include that girl in the invitation. I walked in the club slamming the door.

""How the fuck could you do that Gunner?""

""What?""

""Not invite that girl here.""

""And you,"" I said, looking at her mother and brothers.

""What the fuck is wrong with you?""

""As her mother you should not have come here without her.""

""Some fucking mother you are.""

""And you guys as her brothers should have stood up for your little sister.""

""She told me our club can go straight to hell.""

""And I just bet she will have somethings to say to all of you.""

I said. ""Gunner you should have mad it plain that girl was included in the invitation.""

""Where is she Grace?""

""In town at the restaurant.""

Then we heard the bike coming down the street. That might be her returning home."" Go get her Ripper.""

I saw her walk into the house as I walked across the street. I knocked on the door and waited for her to answer it. I opened the door and saw the VP standing there. I looked at him with cold eyes. I slammed the door shut and locked it.

What the hell just happened I asked myself. Her eyes were like ice. She took one look at me and slammed the door shut without saying one word. I knocked again but she didn't answer it. I walked back to the club.

""Where is she?"" Asked Gunner.

I told him what happened and her brothers gasped.

""Fuck mom, she is going to do it again.""

Come and take a seat in the bookclub room - Minjun is preparing the coffee with his usual dedication.  Today we are discussing from **Can I Make a Living with a Bookshop** to the **end**.  This book was quite a contrast to our first South Korea book, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.  A summary of this section follows and questions will be in the comments.  📚 ☕

**Can I Make a Living with a Bookshop?**

Yeongju attracts more customers to the shop after both an interview with a newspaper journalist and her regular book column.  She also begins receiving commissions for essays on books, bookshops and reading.  The strain however becomes too much.  Fortunately, Sangsu, one of the bookclub leaders, offers to help during the busiest times, for minimum wage.  Between customers, he reads, but is often approached for book recommendations.  

Yeongju holds a talk for prospective bookshop owners, joined by several other booksellers who discuss the challenges of the trade.  She admits that she constantly worries about the shop's financial stability.  Mincheol continues to visit twice a week, and becomes a taste-tester for Minjun's coffee as Minjun works to reduce its bitterness.

**Barista ‘IN’ on Monday**

Because Mondays were Minjun's day off, Yeongju would post notices on social media that coffee would not be served. Customers were supportive of this work-life balance, which had become part of the bookshop’s culture. Minjun created some confusion when he began turning up on Mondays in his mission to perfect his coffee. Yeongju resolved the situation by advertising that the Barista would now be 'IN' on a Monday, resulting in an increase in the number of regular coffee customers.

**I'll Help You Take a Look**

Jungsuh shows concern for Yeongju who is still struggling under the increased workload. Yeongju reassures her that she is coping, but regrets the loss of her reading time.  Seungwoo helps edit her writing, explaining that corrections were to be expected, and not something to worry about.  On one occasion, as they are leaving the shop for the night, Seungwoo asks Yeongju if there is something she is waiting for, admitting that he himself is yearning for someone's heart.  Yeongju wonders what he means.

**With Honesty and Sincerity**

One evening Mincheol, who has been struggling with a writing assignment he must complete if he wants to avoid [cram school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagwon), asks Seungwoo if he enjoys writing, and about his job.  Mincheol then explains that his mother has set him an essay on whether he should pursue something he enjoys or something he is good at.  Mincheol admits that he cannot even think of anything that he enjoys and feet lost. Seungwoo recognises this as a problem not confined to teenagers. He explains that doing what you like does not guarantee happiness; the environment is more important.  Seungwoo reveals that he once worked as a software developer, his dream job, but left because of an unsupportive environment. By immersing himself in the Korean language, he eventually arrived where he is today.  He encourages Mincheol to try different things, and to do his best in whatever he is doing.  He tells him to write honestly, and with effort, and that is enough.

**To Focus on Coffee When Making Coffee**

Minjun starts learning to roast at the Goat Beans, a more appropriate place for practising, where Jimi and the staff take the work seriously.  Jimi encourages him, and Minjun becomes intensely focused, concentrating solely on the task in front of him.  He had once discussed the principle of living in the moment with Jungsuh, and wonders if he is on the path to becoming a more mature person.  Jungsuh believes that focusing fully on a task leads to a better result.

**Who Was the Man Who Came to Look for Yeongju?**

One day, as Seungwoo, Mincheol, Jungsuh and Minjun are chatting in the bookshop, a man enters and looks directly at Yeongju, who recognises him.  She leaves the shop with him, and the others grow concerned.  Two hours later Yeongju returns with swollen eyes.  When oniy Seungwoo and Minjun remain, Yeongju begins to talk to Minjun about how she had chosen the bookshop’s name in haste, and later regretted it, though she now feels it suits.  As he leaves, Seungwoo hands her a piece of paper with his edits, recognising the melancholy in her expression.  Yeongju then explains that the man was a friend of her ex-husband, bringing a message for her.

**Letting Go of the Past**

That night, Yeongju reflects on her conversation with Taewoo, a friend of her ex-husband Chang-in.  She had met Chang-in through Taewoo, and they had shared much in common:  past failed relationships, and strong focus on their careers.  When Yeongju began to suffer from burnout,  her husband failed to make time to listen.  She left him when he refused to stop working for her.  At the end of their divorce , he told her he would be miserable, but that she should forget him, and that he didn't want to see her again.  Taewoo had told her that Chang-in read her newspaper column from time to time and was no longer angry.  He wanted to let her know that he, too, had been at fault, and that after sensing the sadness in her writing, he hoped he was not the cause of it.  Taewoo apologised for being harsh in the past and said Chang-in wished for them all to stay in contact.  Yeongju explains how she opened the bookshop after the divorce, fulfilling a childhood dream.  She chose Hyunam-dong because *hyu* meant “rest”, even though she had never been there.  The shop she found needed renovation, mirroring the rebuilding of her own life.  Though she was growing stronger, she still carried guilt for leaving without apologising.  Today's apology from Chang-in gave her the permission to apologise as well, and be free to embrace her new life.

**As if Everything Was Fine**

Yeongju organises a film screening, inviting a film critic to lead the discussion, to be followed by a discussion on the novel.  Minjun tells her that he has seen the film, and it was one that provoked him to reflect on whether he was the adult he wanted to be, and what it means to live a life chasing dreams.  He wondered if it might be better to abandon the pursuit and just enjoy living.

**Let's Like Each Other**

Yeongju and Seungwoo discuss the novel *Zorba the Greek* - she loved the freedom that Zorba represented, and had once tried to be like him.  Seungwoo asks her about the visitor and why she told him who he was.  She says she didn't want to lie by omission, hinting that Seungwoo might have special feelings.  She warns him that she is selfish and might hurt someone else.  He wants to tell her that everyone hurts someone at some point, but instead suggests that they agree to like each other.

**A Life Surrounded by Good People**

Jimi comes to the bookshop to announce that she's getting a divorce.  Not knowing how to feel she decides to feel nothing for the moment. They watch the movie which explores the uncertainty of living a life when it is your first and only one.  Minjun had challenged Sungchul about his claim to be a film critic since he had no affiliation with any organisation.  Sungchul said he critiques movies, so therefore he is a movie critic.  They discussed Minjun's barista work, which Minjun finds satisfying and creative.  He tries not to overthink life, and to just fill it with things he enjoys.

**A Test of Feelings**

At the Goat Beans, Jimi tells Minjun that it was he who had made her reevaluate her relationship with her husband.  She realises that ending things that were not working out was a way of living well.  Jimi and Jungsuh come around to Yeongju’s apartment with food and drinks.  Jungsuh is seeking employment having decided that if her colleagues are horrible, she'll just find her own peace.  She asks Yeongju about her relationship with the author, who says there's nothing going on because she's bad at relationships.  Jimi says she had noticed Seungwoo’s concern for Yeongju and asked her if she would prefer that he didn't show interest.  By thinking about this question, her feelings should become clearer.


**A Place that Makes Me a Better Person**

Yeongju opens up to Minjun about how her attitude towards work has changed.  Whereas in the past she viewed it as stairs to reach the top, now she views work as food, to be eaten with care.  Minjun's diligence has motivated her to become a better person, although she still has to work on sharing.  She loves the bookshop and wants it to continue, and offers Minjun permanent employment.

**Let's Meet in Berlin**

Minjun signs the contract, and Yeongju embarks on a project to visit independent bookshops around the world to learn how they stayed alive.  She was excited about her first solo trip.  On her way to the airport, Mincheol calls her to announce that he's decided not to go to university, a decision he arrived at after reading *Catcher in the Rye*.  Yeongju understands - books have often helped her make decisions.  The next call is from Seungwoo, who asks her if he could be her travel partner in Berlin.  She hesitates, but after he helps her to imagine the scene of going from bookshop to bookshop, stopping for meals and drinks, reading and discussing books together, she agrees.

**What Keeps a Bookshop Alive?**

One year later, Sangsu is now the second full-time employee at the shop, with his own corner for his book recommendations.  Mincheol has also begun part-time work there after a European trip his mother encouraged him to take.  They start a Staff Bookclub which grows in popularity.  Yeongju implements her changes to the bookshop, deciding on a focus of curating books with depth, and stops carrying bestsellers.  She was convinced that bestsellers were the reason for the loss of diversity.  Instead, she stocks books that are similar in theme.  She realises that she must stay true to her roots - she is a book lover, and wants to pass this on to others.

1q5b78f,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1q5b78f/how_to_become_so_selfdisciplined_it_feels_illegal/,How To Become So SELF-DISCIPLINED It Feels Illegal: The Psychology Deep Dive,"I've spent way too much time analyzing why some people seem to have ironclad discipline while most of us struggle to stick to basic habits for more than three days. After diving deep into behavioral psychology research, dissecting content from people like Dan Koe, and testing this stuff myself, I realized something wild: we've been approaching self discipline completely backwards. 
 
Society sells us this idea that discipline is about white knuckling through pain and forcing yourself to do shit you hate. That's precisely why most people fail. Real discipline isn't about suffering, it's about rewiring your brain's reward system and creating environments where the right choices become automatic. And no, this isn't some rah rah motivational BS. This is backed by actual neuroscience and behavioral economics research. 
 
**1. Stop relying on willpower alone because it's a depletable resource** 
 
Willpower is like your phone battery. Every decision drains it a little. By 3pm you're running on 15% and suddenly ordering takeout instead of cooking sounds perfectly reasonable. 
 
Roy Baumeister's research on ego depletion proved this. The solution isn't building more willpower, it's designing your life so you need less of it. Make decisions once, then automate them. Same breakfast every morning. Same gym time. Same work routine. Sounds boring but that's literally how every high performer operates. 
 
James Clear talks about this extensively in ""Atomic Habits"" (bestselling productivity book, over 15 million copies sold). He breaks down how tiny systems beat goals every single time. The book will make you question everything you think you know about building habits. What hit me hardest was his concept of identity based habits, instead of saying ""I want to work out,"" you say ""I am someone who works out."" Insanely good read that actually changed how I approach everything. 
 
**2. Use temptation bundling to hijack your dopamine system** 
 
Your brain doesn't actually resist discipline. It resists boredom and delayed gratification. Katherine Milkman from Wharton School studied this phenomenon and found that pairing necessary tasks with immediate rewards dramatically increases follow through. 
 
Only listen to your favorite podcast while doing cardio. Only watch that show you're obsessed with while meal prepping. Only grab your fancy coffee after completing your morning routine. You're essentially bribing your primitive brain with instant gratification while building long term habits. It sounds manipulative because it is, you're manipulating yourself into doing hard things. 
 
**3. Create friction for bad habits and remove it for good ones** 

The Ash app does this brilliantly for mental health (it's basically a pocket therapist that helps you identify emotional patterns and relationship dynamics in real time, genuinely helpful for understanding why you self sabotage). But you can apply this principle everywhere. 
 
Want to stop doomscrolling? Delete social media apps and only access them through browser. That extra 30 seconds of friction is enough to break the autopilot behavior. Want to read more? Sleep with a book on your pillow. The average person checks their phone 96 times per day according to research, mostly out of pure habit, not actual desire. 
 
BJ Fogg's ""Tiny Habits"" explains this perfectly. He's a Stanford behavior scientist who's dedicated his career to understanding how habits actually form. His framework is stupidly simple: make it tiny, find the right spot in your routine, and celebrate immediately. The book feels almost too basic at first but that's the point, we overcomplicate everything. This is the best habit formation book I've ever read because it actually accounts for how humans work, not how we wish we worked. 
 
**4. Track everything obsessively for 30 days minimum** 
 
What gets measured gets managed. Sounds corporate and annoying but it's true. Use apps like Streaks or even just a basic spreadsheet. Seeing your streak builds momentum. Breaking it creates genuine psychological discomfort. 
 
I use the Finch app for habit building and it's weirdly effective. You take care of a little virtual bird by completing your habits and it's somehow more motivating than any productivity app I've tried. The gamification aspect tricks your brain into caring about arbitrary tasks. 
 
BeFreed is an AI powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers that transforms book summaries, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio learning plans. It pulls from high quality sources to create custom content based on your specific goals, like building better discipline or understanding behavioral patterns. You can adjust both the length (10 minute overview to 40 minute deep dive) and the style, and it includes all the books mentioned here plus thousands more. The adaptive learning plan evolves with you, and there's a virtual coach you can chat with about your unique struggles. It's been useful for turning scattered reading into structured daily learning without having to dig through dozens of books manually. 
 
The research backs this up too. A study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that people who tracked their habits were twice as likely to stick with them long term. Your brain loves data and patterns. Give it clear feedback loops. 
 
**5. Schedule your discipline during your biological prime time** 

Daniel Pink's ""When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing"" breaks down how our cognitive abilities fluctuate dramatically throughout the day. Most people hit peak mental performance 2-4 hours after waking. That's when you should tackle your hardest, most important work. 
 
Stop scheduling bullshit meetings during your prime hours. Stop checking email first thing. Stop wasting your peak performance window on reactive tasks. This one shift alone probably adds 10-15 hours of productive time weekly. 
 
The book is packed with research from chronobiology and shows how timing affects literally everything from medical procedures to test scores. It's not just about working hard, it's about working when your brain is actually capable of hard things. 
 
**6. Build identity momentum instead of chasing outcomes** 
 
This is where most discipline advice falls apart. People focus on the goal (lose 20 pounds, make six figures, whatever) instead of becoming the type of person who naturally does the things that lead to those outcomes. 
 
Dan Koe hammers this concept constantly. Stop saying ""I want to be disciplined."" Start saying ""I am disciplined."" Your brain literally cannot tell the difference between identity and aspiration if you consistently act as if it's true. Fake it till your neurology catches up. 
 
Cal Newport's ""Deep Work"" explores this from a different angle but reaches the same conclusion. He argues that the ability to focus intensely is becoming increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. The book is basically a manifesto for why discipline and deep focus are the ultimate competitive advantages in a distracted world. Newport profiles people who've mastered this and they all share one trait: they see focused work as part of their identity, not a chore. 
 
**7. Use implementation intentions to remove decision fatigue** 
 
Instead of ""I'll work out tomorrow,"" say ""I will go to the gym at 6am, drive to the location on Main Street, and start with 10 minutes of cardio."" Psychologist Peter Gollwitzer found that this specific type of planning increases follow through by over 300%. 
 
Your brain loves clear instructions. Vague goals require constant decision making which drains willpower. Specific implementation intentions run on autopilot. You're not deciding whether to work out, you're just executing a predetermined script. 
 
This applies to everything. ""I'll eat healthier"" becomes ""I will meal prep on Sunday at 2pm for 90 minutes."" ""I'll be more productive"" becomes ""I will work in 90 minute blocks starting at 9am with my phone in another room."" 

The system itself becomes your discipline. You're not relying on motivation or feelings. You're following a protocol regardless of how you feel, which is exactly how discipline actually works. 
 
Look, nobody wakes up naturally disciplined. It's a skill you build by manipulating your environment, understanding your neurology, and creating systems that make the right choices inevitable. Stop romanticizing the struggle and start engineering your life so discipline becomes the path of least resistance.",1,1767681086.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

I get that, but that only works for layers that exclusively should have the new color. Right?

I would like to print [this](https://www.printables.com/model/473351-updated-grind-setting-dial-v20-universal-fit-eurek/comments) dial for at coffee grinder, where there are lines and numbers to indicate how far the dial has been turned. When i look at the files in PrusaSlicer, it seems to me the lines and numbers are indented/recessed/lowered into the dial. How would i go about printing that in two colors, so it is easy to see the lines and numbers?

If i were to insert a pause before the top 5 layers (or whatever how many layers it should be) and change filament, it means the top 5 layers of the dial would also be the new color.

I can see that someone else with a MINI+ has done it, but i have no idea how.

Again, i'm very new to all this, can someone point me in what direction i should look, to learn more about this?

when Onix launched XI Alpha in 2024 I had jumped on band wagon and had bought one. I became instant fan. I had very moderate expectations from it. Maybe that made it hit for me. Now fast forward 2025 Onix announced XI Beta a successor to Alpha. Beta has tubes and Solid state amplifier chips so two in one. I was very kin to get my hands on it but price was hindrance. I was not ready to spend twice the amount of XI Alpha. So the wait continued. Fast forward few days back my friend SushiFi gave me good news. He had recieved Onix XI Beta for review. He asked me if I wanted to review it. I said hell ya!. After counting days excruciatingly I have in my hands the Onix XI Beta. Well does it deliver? Is it real successor? Does the price justifies? So many questions right? Well read on for the answers.

First of all huge thanks to SushiFi for the opportunity and to Onix without their review tour this wouldnt have been possible. 

I have not been paid or compensated in any manner to write this review. All thoughts and opinions expressed here are mine. 

What are my biases I like R2R > Tubes > Delta Sigma amplifiers.

Please see music section for music choices to further understand how I arrive at my conclusions.

Now that all pleasantries are done for Lets proceed to meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Purely made out of metal. It insipres confidence. This time around the edges are round rather than  square. Also the unit is wider than Alpha. Less tall than Alpha. There is enough space between 3.5mm & 4.4 mm to include another port. On opposite side is USBs type c port. Top of the unit is glass display which diplays bit rate, volume level, filter, gain level, line out or phone out, playing or mute. Adorning the screen are two buttons. Volume button controls volume. Volume here can be independent or synched. Small button acts as play & pause. Also it acts as menu button. This button changes color as per bit rate. On bottom there is leather strip on the metal which gives premium feeling in hand and provides texture for avoiding sliding off. On sides you have windows to see tubes glowing inside. This provides visual indicator of tubes working. 

Provided short type c to c cable is premium and goes well with color theme of Onix Xi beta.
Would love to see a case included at this price point.

Overall Build Quality 5/5. 



Music Genre Used for this Review :

Hiphop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.


Test Gear Used :

Activo Q1 , Oriveti OD200, Hidiz Mp143, Sennhieser HD560s, HD600, Hifiman Edition XS and many more sets.


Impressions of both Working Modes :

Well as you all know onix Beta has both modes i.e Tube mode and Solid state mode. Here I have compared both modes. 

In Tube Mode :

Bass becomes bit rounder.
Vocals feel more natural.
Treble feels smoother.
Entire presentation is more towards musical rather than analytical.
Volume scalling feels low in tube mode compared to tube off mode. For same volume levels the volume in tube mode feels less.

In Tube Off Mode :

Details Increase compared to tube mode.
Vocals pop compared to tube mode.
Treble feels more extended.
There is increase in percieved soundstage.
Presentation is more analytical than tube mode. Mind you its not like ESS presentation. Its still classic CS presentation. No glare in treble.
   
Comparison against Onix Alpha :

when compared both modes of the Beta with Alpha. I found out that Solid state mode has more details than Alpha. It sounds more clearer than Alpha. Soundstage feels bit larger. Micro details pop more. Treble extends well.

With tube mode the musical nature makes the beta stand out more than Alpha. It has more or less has similar details. Only soundstage is bit smaller. Else it sounds more enjoyable than Alpha.

In my opinion in both modes the Onix Beta is truly improvement over Alpha and we can call it successor to it.



Final Conclusion :

This is really nice product release by onix. Onix has created perfect balance between the tube goodness and details. With most tube amps you lose details. Here the loss of details is miniscule. You get all macro and micro details. Just micro details dont pop like most solid state amps. Best part is that onix has secondary ss mode so if you feel that something is missing in the presentation you can just switch to it and get that part. So you have 2 in 1 tuning option here. You can enjoy musical and analytical both in the same. Here the tuning is not analytical like you get in some ESS flavoured Dac & Amps. Here it has onix house touch to it. 

I think this is great release. Hope onix keeps innovating. I feel there are few things that keep this from becoming absolute VFM product. One is the power output. It can power any IEM you pair with it but headphones struggle with it. Again thats not true con as the product design and form factor limit the power output.  Second is the price. I think if Onix had priced it around 200USD it would have been great price for it. It will become more accessible to masses. If the price is reduced it will become market leader. I myself would be buying one soon at sale price. 

Hope Onix listens to people like me and does this in future. 

So for me yes its upgrade over Alpha and true Successor to Alpha.

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now grab a cup of coffee and lets get high on safe high ie Music.

1q5b2qi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q5b2qi,Onix XI Beta,"Onix XI Beta



when Onix launched XI Alpha in 2024 I had jumped on band wagon and had bought one. I became instant fan. I had very moderate expectations from it. Maybe that made it hit for me. Now fast forward 2025 Onix announced XI Beta a successor to Alpha. Beta has tubes and Solid state amplifier chips so two in one. I was very kin to get my hands on it but price was hindrance. I was not ready to spend twice the amount of XI Alpha. So the wait continued. Fast forward few days back my friend SushiFi gave me good news. He had recieved Onix XI Beta for review. He asked me if I wanted to review it. I said hell ya!. After counting days excruciatingly I have in my hands the Onix XI Beta. Well does it deliver? Is it real successor? Does the price justifies? So many questions right? Well read on for the answers.

First of all huge thanks to SushiFi for the opportunity and to Onix without their review tour this wouldnt have been possible. 

I have not been paid or compensated in any manner to write this review. All thoughts and opinions expressed here are mine. 

What are my biases I like R2R > Tubes > Delta Sigma amplifiers.

Please see music section for music choices to further understand how I arrive at my conclusions.

Now that all pleasantries are done for Lets proceed to meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Purely made out of metal. It insipres confidence. This time around the edges are round rather than  square. Also the unit is wider than Alpha. Less tall than Alpha. There is enough space between 3.5mm & 4.4 mm to include another port. On opposite side is USBs type c port. Top of the unit is glass display which diplays bit rate, volume level, filter, gain level, line out or phone out, playing or mute. Adorning the screen are two buttons. Volume button controls volume. Volume here can be independent or synched. Small button acts as play & pause. Also it acts as menu button. This button changes color as per bit rate. On bottom there is leather strip on the metal which gives premium feeling in hand and provides texture for avoiding sliding off. On sides you have windows to see tubes glowing inside. This provides visual indicator of tubes working. 

Provided short type c to c cable is premium and goes well with color theme of Onix Xi beta.
Would love to see a case included at this price point.

Overall Build Quality 5/5. 




Music Genre Used for this Review :

Hiphop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.


Test Gear Used :

Activo Q1 , Oriveti OD200, Hidiz Mp143, Sennhieser HD560s, HD600, Hifiman Edition XS and many more sets.


Impressions of both Working Modes :

Well as you all know onix Beta has both modes i.e Tube mode and Solid state mode. Here I have compared both modes. 

In Tube Mode :

Bass becomes bit rounder.
Vocals feel more natural.
Treble feels smoother.
Entire presentation is more towards musical rather than analytical.
Volume scalling feels low in tube mode compared to tube off mode. For same volume levels the volume in tube mode feels less.

In Tube Off Mode :

Details Increase compared to tube mode.
Vocals pop compared to tube mode.
Treble feels more extended.
There is increase in percieved soundstage.
Presentation is more analytical than tube mode. Mind you its not like ESS presentation. Its still classic CS presentation. No glare in treble.
   
Comparison against Onix Alpha :

when compared both modes of the Beta with Alpha. I found out that Solid state mode has more details than Alpha. It sounds more clearer than Alpha. Soundstage feels bit larger. Micro details pop more. Treble extends well.

With tube mode the musical nature makes the beta stand out more than Alpha. It has more or less has similar details. Only soundstage is bit smaller. Else it sounds more enjoyable than Alpha.

In my opinion in both modes the Onix Beta is truly improvement over Alpha and we can call it successor to it.




Final Conclusion :

This is really nice product release by onix. Onix has created perfect balance between the tube goodness and details. With most tube amps you lose details. Here the loss of details is miniscule. You get all macro and micro details. Just micro details dont pop like most solid state amps. Best part is that onix has secondary ss mode so if you feel that something is missing in the presentation you can just switch to it and get that part. So you have 2 in 1 tuning option here. You can enjoy musical and analytical both in the same. Here the tuning is not analytical like you get in some ESS flavoured Dac & Amps. Here it has onix house touch to it. 

I think this is great release. Hope onix keeps innovating. I feel there are few things that keep this from becoming absolute VFM product. One is the power output. It can power any IEM you pair with it but headphones struggle with it. Again thats not true con as the product design and form factor limit the power output.  Second is the price. I think if Onix had priced it around 200USD it would have been great price for it. It will become more accessible to masses. If the price is reduced it will become market leader. I myself would be buying one soon at sale price. 

Hope Onix listens to people like me and does this in future. 

So for me yes its upgrade over Alpha and true Successor to Alpha.

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now grab a cup of coffee and lets get high on safe high ie Music.

I got a new moka pot and prepared decaf coffee in it, i didn't realize that you're not supposed to drink it straight up you're supposed to add a lot of milk( im a coffee NOOB). Within 5 minutes after taking a few sips my heartbeat was at like 180 🫢. I was hyperventilating and shaking and even wanted to call an ambulance(yes ik im dramatic). Im just glad i survived. I really thought i was gonna die. Anyways note to self always add more milk in your coffee even if its decaf unless you want bad palpitations.

1q5b2kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q5b2kd/aio_is_my_ex_friend_harassing_me/,AIO?? is my ex friend harassing me??,"(throw away post Im going to be very vague, I am not including everything, and what I say here is how Ive gone through things and how I have seen it through my eyes, and unfortunately a lot of stuff is hear say so this for sure isn't the full story or the exact truth.  i'm just at a loss and need third party opinions with no bias, and if i'm the one in the wrong how to learn from my mistakes) I’m looking for advice on a situation that started with a friendship breakup and has turned into what feels like harassment. I’m genuinely trying to understand if I handled things wrong or if I need to take this more seriously.

In early summer, my former close friend and I were extremely close. We even had a shared graduation party and worked together. After the party, she suddenly became distant in a way that felt very calculated. I was confused, so I texted her asking if I had done something wrong. She avoided the question and insisted everything was fine. It felt off, but I didn’t push it.

Soon after, she started hanging out with people and doing plans we had talked about doing together but with others instead, including people who had previously hurt me. What confused me most was that if I had done this to her, she would have been furious.

My boyfriend of nearly four years noticed the change too. At the time, he was friends with her boyfriend (now ex), so he asked him privately if I had done something to upset her. He was told no.

That same weekend, she asked me to cover her work shift because she was at a festival we had planned to attend together but she went with other people. I covered the shift. Later that day, she texted me saying, “I know what you said.” I assumed there was a miscommunication about the conversation between our boyfriends. I tried multiple times to explain that nothing malicious was said, but she told me she needed space.

After several days, I asked to talk in person. I explained that I felt like I had done something wrong, especially based on who she was hanging out with and the fact that she only contacted me about work. She apologized, but it felt off. We were “friends” again for about a week, then she ghosted me completely.

Later that summer, while I was volunteering at a summer camp, I found out an old friend was in a coma due to an accident. I shared the GoFundMe to support the family. Shortly after I got home, my friend passed away, and I shared it again. My ex-friend said nothing. I reached out, asking where she had been for me especially since I had supported her earlier in the year when she lost someone.

I also confronted her about hearing (from her ex-boyfriend) that she disliked me due to our shared work and that she had been sharing personal information about me. She responded by accusing me of “comparing grief” and claimed people from middle school said I didn’t even know the friend who passed. That wasn’t true (I knew these people later in middle school and was in all honestly closer to them than the person who passed but I knew the person who passed for a short while in 6th-7th grade before we naturally grew apart, but I had/have found memories of them so I was devastated to hear about their passing).

After that, things escalated. She began spreading private family information about me, telling people I was “crazy”, and posting vague, targeted content about me on social media. She also became close with a girl she used to brutally make fun of. I had a video of her speaking horribly about this girl, and I sent it to her because I genuinely felt she deserved to know. I know this may not have been the best choice, but my intention was to protect her.

From there, My ex friends new friend group became actively hostile toward me. They tried to get my boyfriend to break up with me. When that didn’t work, my boyfriend and I pretended we had broken up to see what was being said behind my back and to understand the harassment better. Due to the fact they started treating my boyfriend like their bestie so he heard everything.

During this time:

* They created a TikTok account mocking my weight and saying they hate fat people
* They stalked my social media
* They commented on posts
* They drove past my house late at night
* They showed up at my workplace

My boyfriend and I eventually confronted them and told them we had been together the entire time and that they needed to leave me alone or we would take further action. Things stopped for a while.

Two weeks ago, they started again by prank-calling both of us.

At this point, I am constantly on edge. Every time I hear a car playing loud music drive past by my house, any time I get a call from a number I don't know, or honestly just walking into our local coffee shops I get anxious and my stomach drops.

I genuinely want to know:

* Did I escalate this situation?
* Did my boyfriend and I handle this wrong?
* Is this harassment, or am I overreacting?
* What should I do next?

I feel like I’ve lost control of a situation that started with me just wanting to understand why my friend pulled away.

update (this post has been a draft until today so im adding an update and posting because this is my last straw) on 01/06, the group of girls is calling people that I know pretending to be me, under the \*67 no caller ID. Ive been told they are saying crazy things while pretending to be me. Would I be over reacting by going into the police station tomorrow? ",2,1767680647.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1q5b2fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q5b2fj/i_work_at_a_diner_in_the_middle_of_nowhere_part_2/,I work at a diner in the middle of nowhere (Part 2),"If you’ve read my last post, you know weird stuff happens at the diner all the time. But this guy? He was different. This isnt like the gnomes or the guy on the payphone. You’re just going to have to read it for yourself.

It was late morning, maybe around ten thirty or eleven. It was the kind of slow where the coffee had that flat, burnt taste that means I should probably make another pot, but no one had asked yet, and I didn’t feel like bothering with it.

There was no radio on. No cars in the lot. Just the fridge humming and the occasional sound from the back, the building shifting its weight like it does when it thinks no one’s paying attention. I remember thinking it felt like a Sunday even though it wasn’t.

The door opened, and this man came in.

He stopped just inside, one foot still on the mat, like he’d hit an invisible line. He didn’t look around. He didn’t take anything in the way people usually do. He just stood there, completely still.

Then, after about a minute, he moved. All at once. Quick, no adjustment, no hesitation. I remember thinking that I hadn’t seen him shift his weight before stepping forward, which didn’t make sense, but I let it go.

He picked a booth at the end of the wall. The corner one with only one side, and that faces the wall. He didn’t slide in. He turned, lowered himself straight down, and sat stiffly with his back straight and his jacket still on.

The vinyl didn’t creak.

It usually does. Even when people try to sit gently. I notice that kind of thing because the sound always makes me laugh a little, because it's funny to think everyone is letting out a little fart when they sit. This time though, there was nothing.

When he looked at me, his eyes moved first. His head followed after, like it was remembering what it was supposed to do.

They didn’t move smoothly. They jerked, snapping from one place to another. Door. Counter. Window. Me. When they settled on my face, they stayed there for a few seconds too long. When they stopped, they stopped completely, like they’d locked.

His mouth didn’t move much when he spoke.

“Coffee,” he said.

The word came out flat and careful. There was a faint clicking under it, barely there, almost like something tapping against glass.

I leaned closer to Marlene and asked, quietly, if she felt anything off.

She didn’t look up from what she was doing. She said a customer was a customer, and as long as nobody was getting hurt, I should do my job. She said it the same way she says it every time, I hate when she talks to me like that, like I'm a child or something.

Anyway, I poured the mug and brought it over. He watched my hands the whole time. Not my face. Not the coffee. Just my hands. His head tilted slightly, then straightened again.

Before I could ask about cream and sugar, he already had the sugar dispenser.

He poured without slowing down. He must have poured for a minute straight. The coffee thickened and then stopped behaving like coffee and more like syrup. He didn’t stir it. He just watched the surface settle, waiting for the little air bubbles to stop floating up.

Then he drank.

Short pulls. Long pauses. Very still in between. Each time he set the mug down, he turned it so the handle faced the same direction it had before. I don’t know why I noticed that, but I did, and once I noticed it I couldn’t stop.

When he was finished, he stood up all at once. No easing out of the booth. Just up. He froze for a second, then smoothed his jacket down with both hands.

He left exact change on the table. I hadn’t even rung him up yet, but it was right.

At the door, he stopped and turned back. His eyes locked in place again, the same way they had before.

“Good,” he said, drawing the word out longer than it needed.

After he left, the diner felt louder. Not immediately. It crept back in. The fridge clicked on. Somewhere behind the wall, something tapped twice and then stopped, and I waited for it to start again.

Marlene told me to clean the booth.

The sugar had spilled over the edge of the table and hardened. The floor underneath was sticky. I wiped it once and made it worse. Wiped it again and spread it farther. At some point, I got annoyed and scraped at it harder than I needed to. It took a long time to get it mostly clean, and it never really felt clean after that.

When I lifted the mug to dump it out, something inside shifted.

There was a roach in the cup.

It was alive.

For a second, it struggled against the syrup, legs moving too fast, like it hadn’t decided which way to go yet. Then it pulled itself free and ran straight up the inside of the mug. It disappeared over the rim and dropped somewhere under the booth before I could react.

The sound that came out of me... I stepped back and dropped the cup. Marlene definitely noticed when it shattered. She wasn’t happy about it.

When I checked under the booth, I didn’t see the roach. If I’m being honest, I didn’t look very hard. I crouched, glanced, and stood back up. I told myself that counted.

The rest of the shift went the way it usually does. A couple of customers. Someone asking for directions and not liking the answer. Someone else was using too much sugar and apologizing like it mattered. Nothing that stood out, which almost made it worse.

But the floor under that booth stayed tacky no matter how many times I cleaned it. i dont know, something... everything about that guy made my skin crawl, and I felt like I just had to share it here, oh, and at least by the time I left, we still hadn't found the roach. It looks like I'm going to have to order some bug traps.",2,1767680635.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

when Onix launched XI Alpha in 2024 I had jumped on band wagon and had bought one. I became instant fan. I had very moderate expectations from it. Maybe that made it hit for me. Now fast forward 2025 Onix announced XI Beta a successor to Alpha. Beta has tubes and Solid state amplifier chips so two in one. I was very kin to get my hands on it but price was hindrance. I was not ready to spend twice the amount of XI Alpha. So the wait continued. Fast forward few days back my friend SushiFi gave me good news. He had recieved Onix XI Beta for review. He asked me if I wanted to review it. I said hell ya!. After counting days excruciatingly I have in my hands the Onix XI Beta. Well does it deliver? Is it real successor? Does the price justifies? So many questions right? Well read on for the answers.

First of all huge thanks to SushiFi for the opportunity and to Onix without their review tour this wouldnt have been possible. 

I have not been paid or compensated in any manner to write this review. All thoughts and opinions expressed here are mine. 

What are my biases I like R2R > Tubes > Delta Sigma amplifiers.

Please see music section for music choices to further understand how I arrive at my conclusions.

Now that all pleasantries are done for Lets proceed to meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Purely made out of metal. It insipres confidence. This time around the edges are round rather than  square. Also the unit is wider than Alpha. Less tall than Alpha. There is enough space between 3.5mm & 4.4 mm to include another port. On opposite side is USBs type c port. Top of the unit is glass display which diplays bit rate, volume level, filter, gain level, line out or phone out, playing or mute. Adorning the screen are two buttons. Volume button controls volume. Volume here can be independent or synched. Small button acts as play & pause. Also it acts as menu button. This button changes color as per bit rate. On bottom there is leather strip on the metal which gives premium feeling in hand and provides texture for avoiding sliding off. On sides you have windows to see tubes glowing inside. This provides visual indicator of tubes working. 

Provided short type c to c cable is premium and goes well with color theme of Onix Xi beta.
Would love to see a case included at this price point.

Overall Build Quality 5/5. 



Music Genre Used for this Review :

Hiphop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.


Test Gear Used :

Activo Q1 , Oriveti OD200, Hidiz Mp143, Sennhieser HD560s, HD600, Hifiman Edition XS and many more sets.


Impressions of both Working Modes :

Well as you all know onix Beta has both modes i.e Tube mode and Solid state mode. Here I have compared both modes. 

In Tube Mode :

Bass becomes bit rounder.
Vocals feel more natural.
Treble feels smoother.
Entire presentation is more towards musical rather than analytical.
Volume scalling feels low in tube mode compared to tube off mode. For same volume levels the volume in tube mode feels less.

In Tube Off Mode :

Details Increase compared to tube mode.
Vocals pop compared to tube mode.
Treble feels more extended.
There is increase in percieved soundstage.
Presentation is more analytical than tube mode. Mind you its not like ESS presentation. Its still classic CS presentation. No glare in treble.
   
Comparison against Onix Alpha :

when compared both modes of the Beta with Alpha. I found out that Solid state mode has more details than Alpha. It sounds more clearer than Alpha. Soundstage feels bit larger. Micro details pop more. Treble extends well.

With tube mode the musical nature makes the beta stand out more than Alpha. It has more or less has similar details. Only soundstage is bit smaller. Else it sounds more enjoyable than Alpha.

In my opinion in both modes the Onix Beta is truly improvement over Alpha and we can call it successor to it.




Final Conclusion :

This is really nice product release by onix. Onix has created perfect balance between the tube goodness and details. With most tube amps you lose details. Here the loss of details is miniscule. You get all macro and micro details. Just micro details dont pop like most solid state amps. Best part is that onix has secondary ss mode so if you feel that something is missing in the presentation you can just switch to it and get that part. So you have 2 in 1 tuning option here. You can enjoy musical and analytical both in the same. Here the tuning is not analytical like you get in some ESS flavoured Dac & Amps. Here it has onix house touch to it. 

I think this is great release. Hope onix keeps innovating. I feel there are few things that keep this from becoming absolute VFM product. One is the power output. It can power any IEM you pair with it but headphones struggle with it. Again thats not true con as the product design and form factor limit the power output.  Second is the price. I think if Onix had priced it around 200USD it would have been great price for it. It will become more accessible to masses. If the price is reduced it will become market leader. I myself would be buying one soon at sale price. 

Hope Onix listens to people like me and does this in future. 

So for me yes its upgrade over Alpha and true Successor to Alpha.

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now grab a cup of coffee and lets get high on safe high ie Music.
