You're not alone! I've been experimenting with optimizing my setup for painfully slow connections,and I wanted to share a few things that have actually made a difference.

First, prioritize. Identify the *absolute* necessities for your ByteLifetyle. Can you realistically cut back on bandwidth-heavy activities like streaming high-definition video and focus on text-based dialog, coding, or offline content creation? A temporary shift can considerably reduce network strain.

Second, bandwidth management is key. Tools like your router's QoS (Quality of Service) settings can prioritize certain types of traffic. I set mine to give video conferencing and important work tasks higher priority than background downloads or non-essential streaming. It's not a perfect solution, but it helps. Also consider using browser extensions that block auto-playing videos and resource-intensive ads.

offline alternatives can be a lifesaver. Pre-download podcasts, articles, or educational videos when you *do* have better connectivity (coffee shop trip, anyone?). Many coding environments work perfectly offline, allowing you to stay productive even with a terrible connection. What other strategies have you found useful for thriving in a ByteLifestyle, even with terrible internet? Let's hear your tips!",1,1749111315.0,ByteLifestyle,0,1.0,False

This technique was born out of my lack of having a gooseneck kettle while still wanted to have a coffee experience that wasn't absolutely hells-waiting-room grade while I went camping.

It's an aero press + pour over technique.

Water gets heated in whatever is available that can hold a boil.

This now gets poured into the aero press which has the spout that is just a center hole sealed with four rubber flaps. When the plunger goes on, I now don't need a scale because 1ml water =1gr water, I can just do it volumetrically looking at the numbers on the side of the aero press.

This can be used with a continuous pour over or with pour overs varying either by time and/or water level.

It gives a more precise control over the jet of water that really agitates the coffee grounds. Just how a water pick cleans your teeth this thing stirs the grounds like a water spoon.

I know a lot of people don't stir the coffee because of flavor profile reasons. I feel like this method offers a lot of grey area to be explored in terms of flavor profile and that it should be considered even by people who don't agitate their grounds with a spoon in their filter.",1,1749111178.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

This might seem like an oddly specific question, but I'd like to get some opinions please!

I'm a cabaret artist, and would love to perform a song in BSL (or SSE). 

For context of who I am, I am a fully hearing person born to hearing parents (however I do have a few Deaf friends/friends who have BSL as their 1st language), and so I'm worried people will think I'm using it as a 'gimmick' or I will offend the d/Deaf community by 'stealing' their culture and language.

I've been learning BSL for over a year now, attend different BSL users/learners clubs (a 2hr lesson on Tuesdays, BSL club with Deaf colleagues at work on Wednesdays, and on the weekends either go to BSL coffee mornings when they occur, or other various activities where I practice BSL with my d/Deaf friends). I've also done a lot of independent research into d/Deaf culture and awareness, and in terms of official qualifications, have nearly completed level 1 (looking to start level 2 or skip to level 3 if possible in September). I'd say my current proficiency is about advanced beginner-intermediate, and if there was a BSL user in the audience I'd be confident holding a conversation with them. (This is not to make me sound like some martyr for the d/Deaf community, just trying to make the point that this isn't something I've just picked up in an afternoon haha).

My Deaf friends have said they think its a good idea, however I'd love to get some wider opinions before I perform it.

It would only be the one song, and I plan on fully studying the song (as opposed to just copying a video of someone signing with SSE).

Will not be offended if people think this is a terrible idea/not my place to do this, just would love to get peoples honest opinions (particularly opinions from d/Deaf people and interpreters, but any opinions welcome).

The digital nomad phenomenon is more than just a trend\; it\'s a seismic shift in how we perceive work\, freedom\, and life itself\. No longer tethered to an office desk or a specific city\, today‚Äôs professionals are redefining success by choosing where they live based on lifestyle\, not salary\. This new paradigm has birthed a generation that thrives on flexibility\, curiosity\, and the unrelenting pursuit of autonomy\. If you‚Äôve ever felt trapped in a routine that stifles creativity and dampens ambition\, then this journey might just be the key to unlocking your true potential\.

Breaking free from the traditional 9\-to\-5 grind isn‚Äôt just about escaping a cubicle‚Äîit‚Äôs about reclaiming control over your time\, your space\, and your destiny\. The digital nomad movement is fueled by those who crave adventure while still earning a living\. It‚Äôs not just about working remotely\; it‚Äôs about living intentionally\, exploring the world\, and building a career that moves with you\. And yes\, it‚Äôs possible to thrive in this lifestyle without sacrificing financial stability or professional growth\.

_üåç Ready to unlock your earning potential\? [Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_

To understand the modern nomadic identity\, you must first grasp what it means to be a digital nomad\. At its core\, it‚Äôs someone who uses technology to perform their job from anywhere in the world\. But it‚Äôs more nuanced than that\. A digital nomad isn‚Äôt just location\-independent‚Äîthey‚Äôre also mindset\-independent\. They reject the notion that productivity is tied to a physical space and instead embrace the idea that results matter most\. This identity is fluid\, adaptable\, and constantly evolving\, much like the individuals who embody it\.

Key characteristics define the digital nomad\: adaptability\, resilience\, and a deep understanding of self\-management\. These individuals often possess a blend of technical skills and soft skills that allow them to navigate diverse environments with ease\. They‚Äôre comfortable with ambiguity\, adept at problem\-solving\, and unafraid to pivot when necessary\. In essence\, they‚Äôre pioneers in a new era of work‚Äîone that prioritizes experience over convention and innovation over inertia\.

Technology has been the great enabler of this transformation\. From cloud computing to video conferencing tools\, the digital age has made it possible to collaborate across continents in real\-time\. What once required an office building now fits into a backpack\. The rise of remote work platforms and freelance marketplaces has democratized access to global opportunities\, allowing anyone with internet and talent to participate in the gig economy\. This shift is not just changing careers‚Äîit‚Äôs reshaping entire industries\.

The evolution of remote work has dismantled the myth that productivity requires a fixed location\. Coffee shops\, co\-working spaces\, and even park benches have become makeshift offices for those who refuse to let geography dictate their success\. The result is a workforce that‚Äôs no longer confined by borders but empowered by them\. The ability to work from anywhere has opened doors to new markets\, cultures\, and perspectives‚Äîeach one enriching the individual and the collective human experience\.

As the demand for remote workers continues to grow\, so does the variety of jobs available to digital nomads\. Freelance writing\, web development\, virtual assistance\, social media management\, online teaching\, graphic design\, e\-commerce\, affiliate marketing\, IT consulting\, and app development are just a few of the common roles that cater to this mobile workforce\. Each of these professions offers unique challenges and rewards\, making it essential for aspiring nomads to identify their strengths and passions before diving in\.

Freelance writing and content creation remain among the most accessible entry points for digital nomads\. Whether it‚Äôs crafting blog posts\, editing manuscripts\, or producing SEO\-friendly articles\, the demand for quality content is insatiable\. With the right portfolio and a bit of hustle\, writers can command high rates while enjoying the freedom to work from anywhere\. The beauty of this role lies in its versatility‚Äîyou can specialize in niches ranging from tech to travel\, ensuring there‚Äôs always a niche waiting to be explored\.

Web development and design are other popular choices for digital nomads\, especially those with a knack for coding and aesthetics\. As businesses increasingly rely on digital presence\, the need for skilled developers and designers continues to soar\. From building responsive websites to optimizing user experiences\, these roles require both technical proficiency and creative flair\. For those who enjoy solving complex problems through code\, this path offers endless possibilities for growth and innovation\.

Virtual assistance and administrative support provide another viable option for those seeking a structured yet flexible career\. Many entrepreneurs and small businesses outsource tasks such as scheduling\, email management\, and project coordination to remote assistants\. This role demands excellent organizational skills\, attention to detail\, and the ability to manage multiple priorities simultaneously\. It‚Äôs ideal for individuals who thrive in fast\-paced environments and enjoy being the backbone of a business\.

Social media management and marketing have also become lucrative avenues for digital nomads\. In a world driven by online engagement\, brands are constantly on the lookout for experts who can curate compelling content and foster meaningful connections with audiences\. From managing Instagram accounts to running Facebook ad campaigns\, this field requires a mix of creativity\, strategy\, and data analysis\. For those passionate about storytelling and audience growth\, this could be the perfect fit\.

Online teaching and tutoring offer a rewarding way to share knowledge while traveling the globe\. With the rise of platforms like VIPKid and Teachable\, educators can reach students across the world without leaving their laptops\. Whether it‚Äôs teaching English as a second language or mentoring in specialized subjects\, this role allows for a deep sense of fulfillment and impact\. Plus\, it‚Äôs a fantastic opportunity to connect with diverse learners and cultures\.

Graphic design and branding continue to be in high demand\, particularly in a visually\-driven digital landscape\. From creating logos to designing marketing materials\, graphic designers play a crucial role in shaping brand identities\. This field requires a strong eye for aesthetics\, an understanding of design principles\, and the ability to translate concepts into visual form\. For those who love art and communication\, this could be a fulfilling career path\.

E\-commerce and dropshipping have emerged as powerful income streams for digital nomads\, especially with the rise of platforms like Shopify and Amazon\. By leveraging trending products and strategic marketing\, entrepreneurs can build scalable online stores from virtually anywhere\. This role requires a blend of business acumen\, market research\, and operational efficiency\. It‚Äôs a dynamic field that rewards agility and innovation\.

Affiliate marketing and influencer management are other popular options for those looking to monetize their online presence\. By promoting products or services and earning commissions on sales\, marketers can create passive income streams while engaging with communities\. This field thrives on authenticity and trust\, making it essential to cultivate a genuine connection with followers\. For those who enjoy storytelling and community building\, this could be an exciting venture\.

IT consulting and technical support provide yet another avenue for digital nomads\, especially those with expertise in cybersecurity\, network infrastructure\, or software solutions\. As businesses increasingly rely on digital systems\, the need for skilled IT professionals remains constant\. This role requires a deep understanding of technology and the ability to troubleshoot issues efficiently\. For those who enjoy problem\-solving and staying ahead of the curve\, this could be a rewarding career choice\.

App development and software engineering are also gaining traction among digital nomads\, thanks to the growing demand for mobile applications and software solutions\. From coding to testing\, these roles require a strong foundation in programming languages and a passion for innovation\. With the right skills and a bit of determination\, developers can build successful careers while exploring the world\.

Navigating the gig economy as a digital nomad requires more than just technical skills‚Äîit demands a strategic approach to building a sustainable income stream\. Unlike traditional employment\, the gig economy operates on a project\-by\-project basis\, making it essential to diversify your offerings and establish a consistent workflow\. By leveraging platforms like Upwork\, Fiverr\, and Toptal\, you can access a global pool of clients and opportunities\.

Leveraging platforms for global reach is a critical component of success in the digital nomad job market\. These platforms not only connect freelancers with clients but also provide tools for collaboration\, payment processing\, and performance tracking\. However\, standing out in a crowded marketplace requires more than just listing your skills‚Äîyou must craft a compelling profile that highlights your unique value proposition and sets you apart from the competition\.

Essential skills for success in digital nomad jobs include communication\, time management\, and adaptability\. In a world where you‚Äôre often the sole representative of your work\, clear and concise communication is paramount\. Whether you‚Äôre negotiating a contract or providing updates to a client\, your ability to convey information effectively can make or break a deal\. Time management is equally important\, as the lack of a structured schedule can lead to procrastination and burnout if not managed properly\.

Adaptability is perhaps the most underrated yet vital skill for digital nomads\. The nature of this lifestyle requires constant adjustment to new environments\, time zones\, and cultural norms\. Being able to pivot quickly and maintain composure under pressure is essential for long\-term success\. This skill not only helps you navigate the unpredictability of remote work but also enhances your ability to learn and grow continuously\.

Challenges faced by digital nomads are as varied as the individuals who pursue this lifestyle\. Managing taxes and legalities can be a daunting task\, especially when operating in multiple countries with different regulations\. It‚Äôs crucial to seek expert advice and stay informed about tax obligations to avoid any legal complications\. Additionally\, dealing with isolation and loneliness is a common issue for many digital nomads\, as the transient nature of this lifestyle can sometimes feel isolating\.

Maintaining work\-life balance is another significant challenge for digital nomads\. Without the natural separation between work and home\, it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of overworking or neglecting personal well\-being\. Establishing boundaries\, setting realistic expectations\, and prioritizing self\-care are essential strategies for achieving a healthy balance between productivity and personal fulfillment\.

Strategies for thriving in a nomadic career involve creating a strong professional network\, investing in continuous learning\, and prioritizing health and well\-being\. Networking is not just about finding clients‚Äîit‚Äôs about building relationships that can support your growth and open doors to new opportunities\. Attending conferences\, joining online communities\, and collaborating with fellow nomads can help you expand your influence and visibility in the industry\.

Investing in continuous learning and growth is another key strategy for long\-term success\. The digital landscape is constantly evolving\, and staying ahead of the curve requires a commitment to lifelong learning\. Whether it‚Äôs mastering a new programming language\, learning advanced marketing techniques\, or developing leadership skills\, the pursuit of knowledge is a powerful tool for advancement\.

Prioritizing health and well\-being is equally important\, as the physical and mental demands of a nomadic lifestyle can take a toll if not managed properly\. Incorporating regular exercise\, maintaining a balanced diet\, and practicing mindfulness can help you stay energized and focused\. It‚Äôs also essential to take breaks and disconnect from work to recharge and reconnect with yourself and others\.

Tools and technologies for digital nomads are the backbone of this lifestyle\, enabling seamless collaboration and productivity across borders\. Must\-have apps for productivity and collaboration include project management tools like Trello and Asana\, communication platforms like Slack and Zoom\, and note\-taking apps like Evernote and Notion\. These tools help streamline workflows and enhance efficiency\, making it easier to manage multiple projects and deadlines\.

Secure and reliable internet solutions are non\-negotiable for digital nomads\, as connectivity is the lifeline of remote work\. Investing in a portable Wi\-Fi hotspot or using local SIM cards can ensure uninterrupted access to the internet\, regardless of your location\. It‚Äôs also wise to use a virtual private network \(VPN\) to protect your data and maintain privacy while working from public networks\.

Cloud storage and file management systems are essential for keeping your work organized and accessible from anywhere\. Services like Google Drive\, Dropbox\, and iCloud allow you to store and sync files across devices\, ensuring that your work is never lost or inaccessible\. These platforms also facilitate collaboration\, making it easy to share documents and track changes in real\-time\.

Finding your niche in the digital nomad job market is a crucial step toward building a successful career\. Identifying your strengths and passions is the first step in this process\. Reflect on what you enjoy doing\, what you‚Äôre naturally good at\, and what excites you about your work\. This self\-assessment will help you narrow down your focus and position yourself as an expert in your chosen field\.

Researching high\-demand niches is the next step in finding your niche\. By analyzing current trends and market needs\, you can identify areas where your skills and interests align with opportunities\. Whether it‚Äôs a booming sector like AI or a timeless field like copywriting\, understanding the demand can help you make informed decisions about your career direction\.

Crafting a unique value proposition is the final piece of the puzzle\. In a competitive market\, it‚Äôs essential to stand out by highlighting what makes you different and why clients should choose you over others\. This involves showcasing your expertise\, sharing your story\, and demonstrating the tangible benefits you bring to the table\.

Building a personal brand as a digital nomad is a powerful way to establish credibility and attract clients\. A strong professional online presence is the foundation of any successful brand\. This includes having a well\-designed website\, an active LinkedIn profile\, and a cohesive social media strategy\. Your online presence should reflect your personality\, values\, and expertise\, making it easy for potential clients to get to know you\.

Showcasing your work and expertise is another critical aspect of personal branding\. By publishing case studies\, sharing client testimonials\, and posting tutorials or thought leadership pieces\, you can demonstrate your capabilities and thought leadership in your field\. This not only builds trust with your audience but also positions you as an authority in your niche\.

Engaging with communities and forums is an effective way to expand your network and gain visibility\. Participating in online discussions\, attending virtual events\, and contributing to relevant groups can help you connect with like\-minded professionals and potential clients\. These interactions can lead to valuable collaborations\, mentorship opportunities\, and long\-term relationships that support your growth\.

Monetizing your digital nomad journey involves diversifying your income streams\, exploring passive income opportunities\, and setting realistic financial goals\. Diversification is key to financial stability\, as relying on a single source of income can be risky in the unpredictable gig economy\. By offering a range of services or products\, you can create multiple revenue streams that complement each other\.

Exploring passive income opportunities is another smart strategy for building wealth as a digital nomad\. Whether it‚Äôs through affiliate marketing\, creating online courses\, or investing in dividend\-paying stocks\, passive income can provide a steady flow of earnings with minimal ongoing effort\. While it may take time to build up\, the long\-term benefits are substantial\.

Setting realistic financial goals is essential for maintaining motivation and direction\. Whether you‚Äôre aiming to save for a house\, fund a trip around the world\, or achieve financial independence\, having clear objectives can help you stay focused and disciplined\. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your goals ensures that you‚Äôre on track to meet your aspirations\.

Choosing the right locations for work and play is a crucial decision for digital nomads\. Factors to consider when selecting a destination include cost of living\, quality of life\, safety\, and internet reliability\. Some cities offer affordable accommodations and vibrant expat communities\, making them ideal for those who want to maximize their budget while enjoying a rich cultural experience\.

Cost of living versus quality of life is a delicate balance that every digital nomad must consider\. While some destinations may offer low costs\, they may also come with trade\-offs in terms of amenities\, healthcare\, and overall comfort\. On the other hand\, higher\-cost locations may provide superior infrastructure and services but can strain your budget\. Finding the sweet spot depends on your personal preferences and priorities\.

Cultural and language considerations also play a significant role in choosing a destination\. Immersing yourself in a new culture can be incredibly enriching\, but it also requires openness and adaptability\. Learning the local language\, respecting cultural norms\, and embracing new traditions can enhance your experience and help you integrate more seamlessly into the community\.

The future of digital nomadism is shaped by emerging trends in remote work\, the impact of AI and automation on digital jobs\, and sustainability and ethical considerations\. As remote work becomes more mainstream\, we can expect to see new models of collaboration\, hybrid work arrangements\, and innovative tools that further blur the lines between work and life\. These developments will continue to redefine what it means to be a digital nomad\.

AI and automation are already transforming the digital job market\, creating both opportunities and challenges for digital nomads\. While some roles may become obsolete due to automation\, new opportunities will emerge in fields like AI development\, data analysis\, and machine learning\. Staying ahead of these changes requires a proactive approach to learning and adaptation\.

Sustainability and ethical considerations are also becoming increasingly important in the digital nomad community\. As more people adopt this lifestyle\, there is a growing awareness of the environmental and social impact of frequent travel\. Initiatives like eco\-friendly accommodations\, carbon offset programs\, and responsible tourism are gaining traction\, encouraging digital nomads to think critically about their footprint and contribute positively to the communities they visit\.

In conclusion\, embracing the digital nomad lifestyle is a bold and transformative choice that offers unparalleled freedom\, flexibility\, and fulfillment\. By understanding the key elements of this lifestyle and equipping yourself with the necessary skills and strategies\, you can build a career that aligns with your values and aspirations\. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out or looking to refine your approach\, the journey of a digital nomad is as rewarding as it is challenging\.

Recapping the key insights\, it‚Äôs clear that the digital nomad movement is here to stay\. It‚Äôs a testament to the power of technology\, the resilience of the human spirit\, and the desire for a life lived on one‚Äôs own terms\. As we move forward\, the opportunities for innovation and growth in this space are limitless\, and the potential for personal and professional fulfillment is immense\.

She won't stop them. There are plenty of men in the world. They can have each other.Once she wakes up, she starts chasing her long-lost dreams. She soon becomes a rising star in the international art scene.Along the way, she casually inherits a multi-billion-dollar fortune, and suddenly everyone is calling her the ultimate winner in life.But just when she's shining brightest, Sebastian comes crawling back while burning with regret. He tries to trap her back in his arms.Julia steps aside with a cold laugh. The more love she gave him then, the more disgust she feels now.She glances at him with icy indifference. ""Mr. Holt, take a good look. Wouldn't want to be hugging the wrong woman.""And later, he kneels outside her door every night with their son. They beg for forgiveness, looking heartbroken and desperate.Julia folds her arms, completely over it. ""Get lost.""

Chapter 1
""Lia, have you thought about what we discussed? Your grandpa isn't doing well. You're our only daughter. Your dad and I don't have anyone else. Are you really not coming home to take over the company?""

Julia Summers sat in the empty room, paintbrush in hand, as her mother Elaine Yates' weary voice crackled through the phone.

In the dim room, she finished her painting with one last stroke, completing the portrait of a family of three.

Just as Elaine braced for another refusal, Julia answered. ""Alright.""

Elaine faltered, sounding almost startled. ""Y-You mean yes?""

""Yes,"" Julia replied evenly. ""I'll come back. I just need time to wrap things up here. I'll be home within two weeks.""

A few clipped exchanges later, she ended the call.

Julia stepped out of the room, her gaze drifting over the three people in the hall below. Her eyes settled on the man seated on the couch.

He was undeniably handsome‚Äîhis features sharp but not harsh, his presence quiet yet intense. His shirt and dress pants were perfectly pressed, the top button neatly done up, giving him an effortless elegance.

This was her husband. The man she'd gone against her family for, rejecting their plans and even cutting them off, all because she'd refused to marry anyone but him.

Sebastian Holt from Javerston was known for being cold and unapproachable, so much so that people in their circle called him ""The Iceborne Scion"". But now, here he was, speaking softly to a woman.

A strikingly handsome boy, around five or six, nestled into the woman's arms. His big, pleading eyes blinked up at her. ""Aunt Penny, will you make trout almondine for me? Please?""

Penelope Dawson tapped the tip of his nose affectionately and smiled. ""Of course.""

Xavier Holt's eyes lit up with delight. ""You're the best, Aunt Penny! Mom never gives me seconds.""

He gave a little pout.

Penelope chuckled. ""Well then, Xav, eat as much as you like today.""

Xavier nodded, beaming. ""You're so nice, Aunt Penny. I wish you were my mom.""

Penelope's smile grew wider.

Julia stood on the upper floor, a dull ache pressing against her ribs.

Kids never knew when to stop eating. She only monitored Xavier's portions because seeing him curled up with a stomachache later would break her heart.

She couldn't take it anymore. That was her husband and son, but when the three of them were together, they looked like the perfect family, while she just didn't belong.

Julia turned and retreated to her room.

Before long, footsteps approached, and Penelope walked in. Her makeup was perfectly done, and her smile was warm and tender.

""Jules, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Xav's birthday together,"" she said.

Penelope used to be Julia's intern. She didn't come from much and was never more than average at her job.

Once, she broke down in tears before Julia and talked about everything she was going through. She told her that if she couldn't find a job soon, she'd have no choice but to go home and settle into marriage.

Feeling sorry for her, Julia brought Penelope into the company. No one expected that Penelope would turn around and wreck Julia's family.

Penelope had been mimicking Julia, determined to replace her as Falcrest Group's new leading lady. By the time Julia caught on, Penelope had already made herself comfortable, securing Sebastian's and Xavier's favor.

Julia had seen past Penelope's act long ago. She even blamed herself for inviting a viper into her nest.

""I'm not feeling well, so I won't be going,"" Julia said flatly.

Penelope put on an innocent act and coaxed, ""You're Xav's mother, Jules. He needs your blessing.""

Julia frowned, about to reject her again, but then the thought struck her, and she sighed.

This was between her and Penelope. Xavier was just a kid and shouldn't be dragged into it. As his mother, Julia owed him this much. So, she set her paints aside and brushed past Penelope on her way downstairs.

Being ignored, Penelope's smile stiffened, and a flicker of malice flashed in her eyes as she followed after Julia.

Julia went still as she stared at Sebastian and Xavier.

It had been ten years since she joined Falcrest Group to gain experience. That was where she'd met Sebastian, and where their constant teasing had somehow turned into a wedding.

She'd defied her family and walked away from their carefully arranged plans all for him. And she'd never regretted it.

Sebastian was everything‚Äîwealthy, handsome, and utterly devoted. And Xavier? A perfect, bright-eyed boy who made her heart swell.

For years, she'd truly believed she had it all.

But now Julia watched as Penelope served food onto Sebastian's and Xavier's plates with a flattering smile. Penelope's presence had ruined everything for her.

Julia quietly scooped some food onto her plate. She was about to take her first bite when a sickening feeling rose in her throat. She dropped the fork and rushed to the bathroom, gagging as her stomach heaved.

Sebastian was instantly on his feet, worry written across his face. However, Penelope stepped in his path, her own expression frantic. She grabbed his arm, asking, ""What's happening to Jules, Mr. Holt?""

""Don't worry about it. She's been like this for a while,"" Sebastian said gently. Then he turned to Julia, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""So what's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food just terrible?""

Julia didn't bother answering. She just dabbed her mouth with a tissue.

Would they even believe her if she said she was pregnant? Then again, what was the point in telling them? She'd be gone soon anyway. Why rock the boat between Sebastian and Penelope?

Penelope was only Sebastian's secretary, but that didn't stop her from calling him out.

""Mr. Holt, you shouldn't talk about Jules like that. She could actually be sick. She's lost so much weight lately,"" she said with a slight frown.

She got up, poured a cup of chamomile tea, and handed it to Julia. ""Jules, are you okay? Here, have some of this.""

Still feeling queasy and unable to bear the sight of her, Julia shoved her aside irritably.

Julia barely used any strength, but Penelope went with the motion, and the hot tea spilled all over her own hand. She cried out in pain.

""Penny!""

""Aunt Penny!""

Sebastian and Xavier rushed over at the same time, their eyes fixed on her injured hand with concern. Her skin, which had been pale just moments ago, was now bright red.

Xavier's eyes glistened with tears, and his voice sounded worried. ""Aunt Penny, does it hurt a lot?""

Penelope gave him a weak smile and brushed it off. ""Don't fuss over me, Xav. I just wasn't paying attention. It's fine.""

Sebastian shot Julia a furious glare, barely keeping his anger under control.

""What the hell are you playing at now?"" he demanded, his voice cutting like a blade.

Julia's chest tightened painfully when she noticed Penelope's smug expression and Xavier standing guard before her. Overwhelmed, she closed her eyes.

""I didn't do anything,"" she murmured.

But Sebastian would never believe her.

The family doctor arrived. Sebastian kept Penelope close, letting her lean against his chest. His eyes were filled with disappointment.

""You've changed, Julia. The old you would never have done something like this out of jealousy.""

Had she really changed?

Yes. She had.

Ten years ago, Julia's skin wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. She wouldn't have lost her glow from all those sleepless nights either.

She would never have given up her career just to manage Sebastian's household because of some offhand comment he made, especially not if it meant getting replaced by someone else in the end.

Suddenly, Julia felt exhausted. She swallowed the words she wanted to say in her defense, turned, and headed upstairs.

Julia paused at her door and looked back one last time, taking in the mess below.

Her eyes lingered on Sebastian and Xavier, whom she'd once loved more than anything. They gathered around Penelope like usual, just as close as ever.

Julia shook her head with a wry smile and rubbed her stomach. She set the timer on her phone, counting down the days until she'd be gone. Then, without looking back, she turned and walked inside.

From now on, she was done with their world.
Chapter 2
The noise outside gradually quieted down. Julia tuned it out with earplugs and a sleep mask, sleeping soundly till morning.

Now that she'd decided to return home and take over the family business, she would have to quit her current job.

She hadn't been to Falcrest Group much since Xavier was born. But back when Sebastian took the reins, she'd been by his side, helping him build the company.

Falcrest Group was the top company in the country, and Julia had played a big part in making that happen. That was why she still collected hefty dividend checks and bonuses every year without ever setting foot in the office.

Early in the morning, Julia studied her reflection. Her dark brown hair fell in gentle curls around her delicate face, and her striking eyes held no warmth.

She was a striking woman. Even though the endless grind of being a housewife wore on her, her beauty held on.

But the constant morning sickness and her family's cold cruelty wore her down over time, until her eyes turned dull and empty.

‚Ä¶

Julia was waiting for her resignation letter to print on the top floor of Falcrest Group when she overheard some employees talking.

""Did you see Penelope's Instagram?""

""Not yet. What did she post this time?""

""A whole bunch of stuff. Looks like she's celebrating someone's birthday. You should check it out.""

They laughed and joked until one of them looked up and noticed Julia. Their smiles vanished.

""M-Ms. Summers?""

""Ms. Summers, you're at the office today?""

Julia nodded casually.

They muttered quick greetings before practically bolting. As they retreated, she caught fragments of their hushed voices.

""Ugh, of all people. Why's Julia even here?""

""She's already married to Mr. Holt. Did she have to rub it in our faces?""

""Please. I've seen the way Mr. Holt acts around her. He's not even that into her. Wouldn't surprise me if they got divorced.""

Julia didn't react to their words. She'd never been well-liked at the company, so she was used to this by now. She never would've fallen for Sebastian if he hadn't helped her through all that workplace bullying.

Bored from waiting, Julia pulled out her phone and opened Instagram.

Penelope posted a nine-photo grid. The first one was from Xavier's birthday party last night. The decorations were over the top, and the centerpiece was a massive three-tiered cake.

But what caught Julia's attention was a photo taken at the hospital, where three hands of different sizes were stacked together, looking warm and tender.

She only had a minor burn. So why was she back at the hospital?

Julia found it ridiculous. She scrolled through the comments, finding that nearly all of them were full of well-wishes and admiration.

""Wow, is this your child's birthday party? So sweet!""

""Showing off again, huh? Who's this secret husband of yours? Won't you let your bestie meet him?""

""No matter what, being together as a family is the greatest happiness.""

Julia knew Penelope had posted all this just to get under her skin, to goad her into lashing out at Sebastian like some unhinged woman.

The old Julia wouldn't have put up with Penelope's petty games. And she definitely wouldn't have tolerated Sebastian and Xavier leaving her behind to go fawn over some second-rate copy of herself.

But now? Julia was leaving, so none of it mattered anymore.

She faintly smirked as she tapped the screen, leaving a bright red heart in her wake.

Once her resignation letter was ready, Julia took it and went straight to the CEO's office, where she handed it to Alexander Kingston, Sebastian's assistant.

The secretarial staff had been whispering about her dismissively, just like the others before them. But the moment they saw her resignation letter, their voices jumped with shock.

""A-am I seeing this right?""

""Ms. Summers is quitting?""

Alexander's face went rigid, panic flashing in his eyes. ""M-Mrs. Holt, Mr. Holt is in an important meeting right now. Maybe you could wait until he's done before handing this in?""

Julia offered a faint smile. ""Don't worry about it. I'm a chief secretary, but that's just on paper. Since you're authorized to handle resignations, there's no need to bother him.""

The onlookers sighed among themselves.

""Do you think the rumors are true? Julia and Mr. Holt are really over? And is Ms. Dawson the homewrecker here?""

""Ms. Dawson? But she's married, isn't she?""

""Open your eyes. That hand in her Instagram post was obviously Mr. Holt's. Nobody else in Javerston wears a Rolex that pricey.""

""Exactly. And think about it‚Äîsince Ms. Summers left for maternity leave, Ms. Dawson swooped in on all her tasks.""

""Now that Ms. Summers has quit, she's probably clearing the way for her replacement.""

Julia knew how much these people loved to gossip. There was a time when hearing things like this would have crushed her, leaving her crying under the covers late at night.

But now she realized their words were empty the moment she stopped giving a damn.

She smiled at everyone as if she hadn't heard a word they'd said and gave a polite nod. ""Thank you for your hard work these past ten years. May Falcrest Group continue to thrive and prosper.""

An awkward silence settled over the room. Only then did Julia return to her desk to collect the belongings she'd gathered over the years.

As someone who'd spent ten years with the company, her workspace was packed with reference books from her early days and notes she'd carefully kept after becoming Sebastian's secretary.

The notes spelled it all out‚Äîhe drank hand-ground coffee every morning, couldn't stand tardiness, and banned perfume on any woman, plus all the rest.

Every single note was a mark of Julia's commitment, a quiet record of how much she'd given to this job.

Nobody had a clue what Julia gave up to be good at her job. To most people, being a secretary was just some little role for men's amusement‚Äîsomething a woman could skate by in if she was hot enough.

Sebastian was the only one who noticed the late nights she spent buried in contracts, the hours she put into perfecting presentations, the way she studied every last one of Falcrest Group's competitors until she knew them cold. He saw how she memorized every minor report as if it were second nature.

She worked so hard that even the untouchable scion had to take notice. He actually stepped down from his pedestal.

Julia had always believed Sebastian was the only one who really got her. Apparently, she was wrong. Everything between them fell apart in just ten years.

Julia was busy gathering her things from her desk when the meeting ended. Penelope stepped out first, her bright smile vanishing when she saw Julia.

Penelope's stomach dropped. Was Julia here because of that Instagram post? Was she about to go off on her?

The idea left Penelope on edge. She sank back into her chair, restless and uneasy, waiting for the outburst she was sure would come.

But all anyone else saw was her ducking her head, eyes brimming with tears like she'd been deeply hurt.

Sebastian was the last to emerge. Passing the secretarial department, he was caught off guard to find Julia at her desk.

Julia's desk had always been the one closest to Sebastian's office‚Äîa place of honor that once reflected her status and the closeness between them. Now, just the sight of her there put him on edge.

To make things worse, Julia seemed completely at ease, casually flipping through a book with a quiet smile. Next to her, Penelope sat hunched over her desk, dabbing her tears with a tissue.

Frowning, Sebastian rapped his knuckles on Julia's desk. ""My office. Now.""

She looked up at him, unbothered. ""Alright.""

The second she walked in, Sebastian spoke up. ""Falcrest Group has no use for you right now. Only show up if there's a special occasion.""",1,1749110183.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False
1l3tjd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/study/comments/1l3tjd3/5_things_that_helped_me_enjoy_studying_again/,5 things that helped me enjoy studying again,"Do you ever have a dry spell, when you're just too tired to even want to study? It isn't just a lack of motivation (sometimes I don't feel very motivated but can still have a productive study session), but more like a weird lethargy. I was feeling like this earlier in the year and decided to tackle it head-first. 

Instead of focusing on productivity or output, I decided to focus on the enjoyment metrics (not very breezy of me to link enjoyment to metrics, but you get my point). I think we tend to forget the fun part of studying beyond a certain point and that's ok - it isn't a grassy meadow by a long shot. That said, I realized that a lot of my inertia was connected to the fact that I had started to dread the very act of studying. 

Here is what i changed/added, hope it helps!

1. Following my instincts - I've been studying more intuitively the last couple months. Instead of setting rigid schedules daily, I am more flexible with routine setting. It's honestly fine to be a little ad-hoc, as long as you're not ignoring your to-do list to the point of no return. The Pomodoro method has also helped hugely - I usually do 4 Pomodoro cycles (2 hours) straight away, and then do the next 1-2 hours untimed. 

2. Tracking progress - Honestly, makes a huge difference. I just use an Excel sheet, but there are plenty of apps for this. I track number of hours, subject-wise progress, assignments, and exam prep. I also devised an internal metric called the 'smug score' - it's basically a happiness score that rates how I'm feeling on the day (the smug is for alliteration haha). Weirdly enough, it helps to actually see a low score on the days I'm feeling crappy. Highly recommend.

3. Asking for help - A solitary learner by nature, but trying to keep an open mind there. I've doing bi-weekly study sessions with a friend for 3 months now and it's been really nice. We meet at the library and get a coffee later. A second opinion has helped. Same with profs, I'm seeking them out when I have a query and **clarifying it immediately**. The immediacy has helped - it's a 2 minute task, doing it right away makes sense.

4. Tools on the internet - A combination of a bunch of things. I watch YT videos about a subject where I feel like more context would make my interest greater. I've been creating my own flashcards for revision, very fun. I've also been using an app called Studydrive to access study notes for a little while now - they're all generated by actual students, and have been very helpful. A couple of other fringe tools - I use Calm for guided meditation. 

5. Taking a break - Saving the best for the last. Taking a break!! Can't overstate benefits!! No honestly, I've always scoffed at the idea of taking an indulgent break because I'm tired. Not very self-aware of me. Happy to report it works. ",1,1749110156.0,study,2,1.0,False

1l3thva,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonfictionbookclub/comments/1l3thva/reading_atomic_habits_by_james_clear_is_literally/,Reading Atomic Habits by James Clear is literally a Cheat Code.,"I was a productivity porn addict.

Downloaded 47 habit tracking apps. Bought 12 different planners. Watched every YouTube video about ""morning routines of successful people."" Read every blog post about willpower and motivation.

Result? I was still the same lazy piece of shit who couldn't stick to anything for more than 5 days.

Then I read *Atomic Habits* by James Clear and realized I'd been doing everything backwards.

You think the problem is motivation. Wrong.

You think the problem is discipline. Wrong.

You think the problem is you. Also wrong.

The problem is you're trying to change results instead of systems.

I spent 3 years trying to ""lose 30 pounds"" and ""read 50 books"" and ""wake up at 5 AM."" All outcome-focused bullshit.

James Clear flipped this: **Don't focus on what you want to achieve. Focus on who you want to become.**

Most people do this: *""I want to lose weight, so I'll go to the gym.""*

Smart people do this: *""I'm the type of person who takes care of their body. What would that person do right now?""*

The difference is massive.

When you see yourself as someone trying to lose weight, skipping the gym feels like failure.

When you see yourself as someone who prioritizes health, skipping the gym feels like betraying your identity.

I didn't start exercising to get in shape. I started exercising because that's what healthy people do. Small shift. Huge difference.

Here's the math that changed everything:

* 1% better every day = 37x better in a year
* 1% worse every day = nearly zero in a year

You don't need massive changes. You need tiny improvements that compound.

I didn't go from couch to marathon. I went from couch to walking around the block. Then two blocks. Then jogging one block.

Six months later, I was running 5K without thinking about it.

**Small changes aren't dramatic. But they're permanent.**

Every new habit should take less than 2 minutes to start.

* ""Exercise for an hour"" becomes ""Put on running shoes""
* ""Read 30 minutes"" becomes ""Read one page""
* ""Meditate for 20 minutes"" becomes ""Breathe deeply once""

This sounds stupidly simple because it is. But stupidly simple works.

You're not trying to achieve the habit. You're trying to prove to yourself that you're the type of person who does that habit.

Once putting on running shoes becomes automatic, adding the actual run is easy.

Your environment shapes your behavior more than your intentions.

I kept failing at reading because I'd leave my book in another room while keeping my phone next to my bed.

Then I flipped it:

* Phone charges in the kitchen
* Book sits on my nightstand
* Kindle app deleted from phone
* Physical books stacked where I can see them

Making good choices easier than bad choices is the closest thing to a cheat code for habits.

Link new habits to existing ones: **""After \[current habit\], I will \[new habit\].""**

My morning stack:

* After I start the coffee, I do 10 push-ups
* After I pour the coffee, I write 3 sentences
* After I drink the coffee, I read one page

Each habit triggers the next. It becomes a chain reaction that runs on autopilot.

Here's why most people quit right before they break through:

You work your ass off for weeks with zero visible results. This feels like failure. It's not.

Think of an ice cube at 31¬∞F. Heat it to 32¬∞F and suddenly it melts. The previous heat wasn't wasted - it was accumulating below the surface.

Most breakthroughs happen after months of work that seemed pointless.

I read consistently for 4 months before people started calling me ""well-read."" The reading wasn't working... until suddenly it was.

1. **Start embarrassingly small** (2-minute rule)
2. **Focus on identity**, not outcomes
3. **Design your environment** to make good habits obvious
4. **Stack habits** onto existing routines
5. **Never miss twice** (consistency matters more than perfection)
6. **Track your progress** (what gets measured gets managed)

Atomic Habits isn't a magic pill. It's a boring system that works if you work it.

Most people want sexy, dramatic transformations. Clear offers the opposite - tiny, invisible improvements that compound into massive results.

The choice is yours:

* Keep chasing motivation and failing every few days
* Build systems that make success inevitable

I chose systems. Three years later, I'm unrecognizable from who I used to be.

Not because I had some massive breakthrough moment. Because I got 1% better, every single day, for 1,000+ days straight.

Start today. Start small. Start with identity.

The person you become is more important than anything you achieve.

On most occasions, my decisions have obliged me to behave as strictly as possible, and I feel somewhat like I've developed this decision-making system as a strategy to avoid people's condemnation. I think it has become my defense mechanism and, at the same time, a way of punishing myself after making even the tiniest mistake.


**I don't want to admit it, but I have to face this issue right away. I apologize if, through this post, I sound like a selfish prick whom everybody is terrified to talk to. I just want to know if there are other people like me.**


I'm not sure whether it's a good or bad trait, but I can barely stay in the middle and mostly live at the extremes. Hopefully, I won't get too deep into it, but let me explain how it feels.


I either don't do something, or I pour all my energy into doing it. I either don't make friends with someone, or I form such a strong emotional bond that removing that person from my life feels almost impossible. Though I'm not sure how useful or damaging this attitude might be, I have to admit that it has had its pros and cons so far.


Let me give you a real-life example. I had been drinking coffee for almost five years. Week by week, my caffeine intake increased to the point where I ended up drinking 2-3 double espresso shots a day. Then, a few weeks ago, before going to bed, my father told me to wake him up at 4 a.m. the next morning, and I said okay. That night, I couldn't sleep until 1:30 a.m., and there's no need to mention that it was because of the double espresso I drank at 7 p.m. As a result, the next morning, I woke up at 5:30 a.m., 1 hour and 30 minutes late, and my father almost missed his business meeting with nine people. I was so furious that I decided never to drink coffee again, and I kept my promise. I haven't sipped a single drop of coffee since, and I'll stick to it for the next few years. I even gave my 1 kg of freshly brewed coffee beans to one of my father's friends, so I'd never try coffee again. Therefore, I successfully quit my caffeine addiction overnight.


I have plenty of examples of how I cut off people, whom I once loved with all my heart, from my life in the blink of an eye; some of them were my best friends, whom I had been friends with for more than seven years.


Anyway, overall, I don't deem this idiosyncrasy healthy. My family and my best friends are kind of afraid of me because I can make the hardest and toughest decisions in a few seconds, and they know I'll stick to them for the rest of my life. I feel like a jerk.


Though I tried to express my feelings as clearly and transparently as I could, I understand if it sounds vague or confusing to you. I genuinely appreciate the time you took to read this. Thanks for being there ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,1749109917.0,CasualConversation,0,0.67,False

# How to Make a Hojicha Latte

Hojicha latte is a comforting and aromatic drink made with roasted green tea leaves (hojicha) and milk. Unlike traditional green teas, hojicha has a warm, nutty flavor due to its unique roasting process, and it's low in caffeine, making it a perfect evening beverage. Making hojicha latte at home is simple and rewarding. Here‚Äôs how to do it.

# Ingredients:

* 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of hojicha powder (or 1 tablespoon of loose leaf hojicha)
* 1/4 cup hot water (about 80¬∞C or 175¬∞F)
* 3/4 cup milk of choice (dairy, oat, almond, soy, etc.)
* Sweetener to taste (honey, sugar, maple syrup, etc.)
* Optional: a pinch of cinnamon or vanilla extract

# Instructions:

1. **Choose Your Hojicha:** If you‚Äôre using hojicha powder, you‚Äôll get a smoother, caf√©-style latte. Loose leaf hojicha can also be used‚Äîjust steep and strain it well. Hojicha powder is more concentrated and dissolves easily, making it ideal for lattes.
2. **Brew the Hojicha:** For powder: Sift 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of hojicha powder into a cup to remove clumps. Add hot water and whisk thoroughly using a bamboo whisk (chasen) or a milk frother until it‚Äôs smooth and slightly frothy.For loose leaves: Steep 1 tablespoon of hojicha in 1/4 cup hot water for 3‚Äì5 minutes. Strain the tea leaves.
3. **Heat and Froth the Milk:** In a small saucepan, gently heat your milk of choice. Do not boil. Froth it using a milk frother, whisk, or by shaking in a heat-safe jar. Plant-based milks like oat or almond froth well and complement the roasted flavor.
4. **Assemble the Latte:** Pour the brewed hojicha into your favorite mug. Add sweetener to taste. Slowly pour in the steamed milk, holding back the froth with a spoon. Then spoon the froth on top.
5. **Serve and Enjoy:** Optionally, sprinkle a little cinnamon or drizzle some maple syrup on top. Your homemade hojicha latte is ready to sip and savor.

Whether hot or iced, a hojicha latte offers cozy flavors and a peaceful tea experience. It‚Äôs easy to make and a great alternative to coffee or matcha.",1,1749109914.0,senchabrew,0,1.0,False

My social anxiety got so bad I couldn‚Äôt handle going to classes and dropped out of college after freshman year, now I only take classes virtually. 

After talking about it with my partner, it seems like I just attract negative attention? I would regularly get bullied for things that were perfectly normal or even positive, from how i dressed to daring to wait in a long line at an expensive coffee shop on campus. I even got relentless comments about what laptop I use, only for a professor to compliment it in private. I also had a coworker laugh at me for buying an ipad air instead of a pro? Just random stuff, but it never stops. 

Anytime I ask for advice about this the only responses I get are to ignore it or learn how to snap back. However, I don‚Äôt care enough to make up a comback and my problem isn‚Äôt ignoring them, I already do. I just feel burnt out because the more I ignore them they harder they try, from repeating the same comments, saying them louder, physically blocking me from walking away, ect.

I am a bartender -- I am new to bartending but not hospitality. I love what I do. A lot. It isn't my end goal but I love the job itself. I enjoy the craft of it and I just started to bartend at a daytime coffee place.

Recently I left a bar I had worked at for years because I had what I can only deem as a mental breakdown. I am really codependent, I've been my whole life. My life had become a huge mess, I was drinking a LOOOT and I was becoming this insane narcissistic people pleaser.

I have a history of addiction to stimulants but alcohol was never my DOC -- until I was around alcoholics. Post stimulant recovery, I don't drink alone literally ever and and never feel compelled to drink, especially binge drink, if I'm not with other people who are binge drinking. I love a good cocktail or a beer occasionally but especially since I left that bar over two weeks ago I've noticed literally no urge to drink -- I've had one cocktail since then. (It was good!!! But then I was like ok I'm done and hung at the bar I was at w new friends and was plenty happy.) 

I come from a family of alcoholics and over the years I've found myself around more as friends, esp my coworkers who I became unhealthily attached to. In my own friend group I have multiple close friends in recovery who have even pointed out to me my codependent nature and how I'm not an alcoholic on my own terms but when around alcoholics, I suddenly like, start acting crazy. And that has trickled into my life outside of drinking -- even now two weeks later I am struggling to be alone. Idk what to do without people. I have laid in bed for three hours bc I didn't have a person to hang out with.

Recently, a friend recommended Al Anon based off of what I've told her and from knowing me and said it's really helped her. But I don't want to enter a space and be like hey guys I'm a bartender!! And make other people deeply uncomfortable.

In my industry and even at my last workplace, one of the bartenders I really respect and love talked about how in order for this to be sustainable for him he had to recognize his own relationship with alcohol. I think that there is a larger conversation happening in the industry about that relationship and being around alcoholics and serving alcoholics. But I really would love to have this conversation outside of that space and not just as a theoretical conversation. I just am unsure if Al Anon would be a good fit. But I do really need people to talk about this with in a structured setting and I dont want to fall into the same trap at a new place.",2,1749109733.0,AlAnon,2,1.0,False

# Best Cake Jars 2025: Indulgent Flavors Reviewed

Cake jars have become a popular dessert option, offering convenience and portion control while delivering intense flavor. They are essentially deconstructed cakes layered in a jar, making them easy to transport and enjoy on the go. The appeal extends to individuals seeking individual treats, those looking for unique gifts, and party hosts aiming for easy dessert solutions.With an increasingly crowded market, selecting the best cake jars can be overwhelming. This review analyzes the top cake jar offerings available in 2025, evaluating them based on flavor profiles, ingredient quality, texture, presentation, and overall value. Our goal is to provide a complete guide to help you find the perfect cake jar to satisfy your sweet cravings. We will explore trending flavors, innovative combinations, and the overall experience each brand delivers.## Key Features Analysis

The taste and quality of cake jars largely depend on several key features of their ingredients and design.

**Flavor Complexity:** The cake jars that stood out offered more than just a sweet taste. They featured complex flavor profiles that combined complementary elements. For example, salted caramel was balanced with a hint of coffee, or rich chocolate was brightened with a touch of raspberry. The best cake jars created a harmonious blend of sweet,salty,bitter,and tangy notes,making each spoonful an adventure for the taste buds.

**Ingredient Quality:** Premium cake jars utilized high-quality ingredients, which significantly impacted the overall taste and texture. Real butter,fresh cream,and premium chocolates created rich,indulgent flavors and moist textures. Conversely, cake jars made with artificial flavorings or low-quality shortenings often tasted bland and had an unpleasant, greasy aftertaste. The brands that prioritized ingredient quality consistently delivered a superior product.

**Texture Variety:** A well-constructed cake jar offered a pleasing textural contrast. Moist cake layers were paired with smooth fillings, crunchy toppings, and creamy frostings. this interplay of textures created a satisfying experience.Cake jars with a uniform texture, such as those made entirely of soft cake and frosting, often felt monotonous and less enjoyable.

**Layering and Presentation:** The visual appeal of cake jars is crucial. Neat and distinct layers of cake, frosting, and fillings showcased the different components and made the jars more attractive. Sloppy or poorly layered cake jars often looked unappetizing.Creative garnishes, such as chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or fresh fruit, added visual interest and enhanced the overall presentation.

**packaging and Portability:** The functionality of the cake jar container is also notable.A secure lid prevented leaks and kept the contents fresh. Sturdy jars made of glass or durable plastic ensured the cake jars did not break during transport. Some brands included small spoons or forks, making it even more convenient to enjoy the cake jars on the go. Additionally, attractive labeling and branding added to the overall appeal.

## Core Benefits

cake jars offer a unique set of benefits catering to diverse needs and preferences.

**portion Control:** Unlike a full-sized cake, cake jars offer a pre-portioned serving, making them ideal for individuals who want to indulge without overeating. This is especially helpful for managing calorie intake or satisfying a craving without the temptation of cutting a larger slice. Instead of a whole cake sitting in the fridge, the single-serving size can curb that temptation.

**Convenience and Portability:** Cake jars are incredibly convenient for on-the-go consumption. They are easily transportable in lunch boxes, handbags, or backpacks, allowing you to enjoy a tasty dessert anytime, anywhere. The individual packaging eliminates the need for plates, forks, or knives, making them perfect for picnics, road trips, or office snacks.

**Unmatched Freshness:** The cake jars‚Äô sealed packaging helps maintain freshness for a longer period compared to a traditional cake. The airtight seal prevents the cake from drying out or absorbing odors from the refrigerator. This means you can enjoy a freshly baked taste even days after purchase.

**simplified Sharing:** Cake jars make sharing easy and hygienic, unlike having to find a knife to slice and serve, than having to worry about whoS fork may have touched what. Each person gets their own individual portion, eliminating the need for cutting and serving. this is especially useful for gatherings, parties, or corporate events where individual servings are preferred.

## FAQs Section

**How long do cake jars typically last?**
Cake jars typically last for 5-7 days in the refrigerator. The airtight seal helps prevent the cake from drying out and maintains its freshness. Some cake jars may last longer depending on the ingredients used and the storage conditions. To ensure optimal freshness, it's best to consume them within the recommended timeframe.

**Are cake jars suitable for people with dietary restrictions?**
It depends on the specific cake jar and its ingredients. Some brands offer gluten-free, vegan, or sugar-free options to cater to various dietary needs. Always check the product label for detailed ingredient information and allergen warnings. If you have specific dietary restrictions, it's best to contact the manufacturer directly to inquire about their product formulations.

**Can I freeze cake jars?**
Yes, cake jars can be frozen to extend their shelf life. Wrap the jar tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. Frozen cake jars can last for up to 2-3 months. When you're ready to enjoy them, thaw them in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight before consuming. Be aware that freezing may slightly alter the texture of the cake and frosting.**What‚Äôs the best way to enjoy a cake jar?**
Cake jars can be enjoyed straight from the fridge or at room temperature. Remove the lid and use a spoon or fork to scoop out the cake and frosting layers. You can also warm the cake jar in the microwave for a few seconds to enhance the flavors and create a more indulgent experience. Be careful not to overheat the cake, as it may become dry or mushy. Additionally, it's fun to try to scrape the sides and especially corners to ensure that you get all the good cake crust/edge pieces.

1l3t8cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1l3t8cn/am_i_behind_the_times_or_are_they/,Am I behind the times or are they?,"Okay I haven't stayed in a hotel in a couple of years, before the pandemic. I had to stay in a Hampton by Hilton a few blocks from our home to avoid renovation construction chaos. 
Some things didn't seem right to me. This used to be a nice mid-range hotel it certainly looks nice from the outside. But the observations I have that reduced my comfort and pleasure may seem nitpicky? 

To be fair, the room provided basic shelter: a locking door and window, strong air conditioning, a microwave, a refrigerator, and a television. However, despite those essentials, the stay was uncomfortable, confusing, and noisy‚Äîfar below what I expect from a Hilton-branded property, and even from economy motels.

The TV had no streaming or on-demand options, no working guide, and no access to local broadcast channels like NBC, CBS, or ABC. Those channels showed no service. There was one HBO channel no way to order a movie no way to stream a movie, no way to stream audio for that matter. A whole lot of sports channels, Spanish language channels, children's channels. 
Seriously you can't order a movie anymore? 

 There were no instructions for using the bathtub faucet or switching between the handheld and overhead shower. The hair dryer was placed 6 ft high‚Äîcompletely unreachable for someone in a wheelchair, though the room was designated as wheelchair accessible. I'm not in a wheelchair however I am slightly disabled and I'm really short. I'm taking a bath and washing my hair, I had to stand up to reach the shampoo that was glued to the wall, and pump it about six times before anything came out and then sit back down. You couldn't exactly squirt it ahead of time and hold it in your hand until the bath was ready. There was room for a wheelchair next to the bath and a transfer bench but I'm not disabled.

There was no makeup mirror, and no way to apply makeup close to a portable one. I can't remember staying in a hotel in the last 40 years that didn't have a makeup mirror. 
The microwave was very outdated, and the refrigerator made loud, disruptive noises day and night. The freezer failed to keep frozen even 3 oz ice cream cups, and I bought tiny ones so that that wouldn't be a problem in the tiny freezer of the mini fridge which kept drinks and water cold. The air conditioner and plumbing were also very loud, making the room far from restful. Of course hotel room air conditioning is always loud I guess. But the mini fridge sounded like a jet taking off every other hour.

Only coffee pkgs provided‚Äîno tea, no hot water option.  I am not comfortable microwaving a cup of water until it's superhot, that can be dangerous. So I had to boil my own tea bags in the cup. There were no printed materials, no welcome info, no local guides, not even a notepad so I could write a note when I left my tip. no instructions for appliances, basic  TV channel list, which included the channels that were not available. The toiletries were not the Neutrogena products advertised online, but some off-brand, hotel brand, I don't know but everything smelled like olive oil and was cemented to the walls.

I am a day sleeper and typically sleep from 4 a.m. to noon or later, so I was not awake during breakfast hours and couldn‚Äôt use the complimentary breakfast. While I understand this is often highlighted as a key benefit and perhaps tea was available there, I wouldn't have known because not everybody gets up at 7:00 a.m. and eats a waffle.

Am I expecting too much from $170 a night? I checked in in the evening, got things put away for a stay and got ready for bed to get comfortable in the middle of the night and realize good heavens there's only a channel that shows all the Die Hard movies over and over and over, a channel that showed Forensic files over and over and over, and then of course like three Fox channels the golf channel some ESPN's some children's channels. No PBS, and nothing local. It was like being in a motel 6 with out motel 6 prices. It was clean enough I bring my own blankets and whatnot although should have brought my own pillows because they were feather. What the heck are feather pillows doing in a hotel? Little feathers inside the sheets even. 

Am I being a jerk? I was there for medical reasons to relax and be away from what was going on at my house. I was not there to throw my bags and then run go do all the fun things in town although I wouldn't have known what they were because there was no things to do in this town literature or a local highlights magazine or anything. It literally was like being in a jail cell that was extra large. Glad we have smartphones and I guess they assume everyone does but also another thing why no hand sanitizer?

1l3t810,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyHealing/comments/1l3t810/whats_your_best_coping_mechanism_for_anxiety_or/,What‚Äôs Your Best Coping Mechanism for Anxiety or Panic? Let‚Äôs Talk About It.,"Ever felt like your chest is a balloon about to pop? Or like your brain suddenly forgot how to do‚Ä¶ life? Anxiety and panic can feel like someone slammed the emergency alarm in your body ‚Äî but no one gave you the manual to shut it off.

So, let‚Äôs talk about it. Not from some cold, clinical perspective, but from the messy, real-life trenches. Here's a mix of tried-and-true tips and community-powered wisdom to help you get a grip when anxiety tries to hijack your system.

---

## 1. **Breath is Your Anchor. No, Really.**

You‚Äôve probably heard of the 4-7-8 breathing technique. Inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Sounds simple, right? But when you're mid-panic and your body‚Äôs in full DEFCON mode, remembering numbers feels like solving calculus.

Here‚Äôs the trick: **slow down any way you can**. Count in your head. Blow air like you're cooling soup. Whisper the word ‚Äúrelax‚Äù with every exhale. It‚Äôs not about being perfect ‚Äî it‚Äôs about reminding your body you‚Äôre not in danger, even when your brain‚Äôs convinced you are.

---

## 2. **Grounding Techniques That Actually Work**

Weird but effective: put your hands under cold water. Or dig your toes into the carpet. One person I know keeps a smooth rock in their pocket ‚Äî they rub it when things get dicey.

A classic is the **5-4-3-2-1 technique**:
- 5 things you can see  
- 4 you can touch  
- 3 you can hear  
- 2 you can smell  
- 1 you can taste  

You‚Äôre basically distracting your brain from going down the panic rabbit hole. It‚Äôs like giving a toddler a shiny toy ‚Äî redirect that wild attention somewhere calmer.

---

## 3. **Talk to Someone (Even if It‚Äôs Yourself)**

Not gonna lie ‚Äî I‚Äôve whispered ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay, this is just panic, it will pass‚Äù to myself in bathroom stalls, elevators, and even during Zoom calls (camera off, obviously).

**Naming the fear disarms it.** It turns the monster in the shadows into something with shape, something you can deal with. And if you‚Äôve got someone safe to text or call during these moments? Even better. Sometimes, just a ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm spiraling a bit‚Äù is enough to shift the weight.

---

## 4. **Create a ‚ÄúCalm Kit‚Äù Before You Need It**

You know how you can‚Äôt find your keys when you‚Äôre late? Same idea with coping tools. You need them ready *before* the storm hits.

Build your own mini anxiety survival kit:
- Noise-canceling headphones
- Lavender roll-on or essential oil
- Fidget cube or stress ball
- A playlist labeled ‚ÄúBrain Melting Down‚Äù
- A sticky note with a reminder: *This will pass. It always does.*

It‚Äôs like emotional first aid ‚Äî but for your brain.

---

## 5. **Get Moving, Even Just a Little**

Look, you don‚Äôt have to hit the gym. But walk around the block. Shake out your arms. Stretch. Panic is energy overload ‚Äî movement is a pressure valve.

My personal favorite? **Doing the silliest dance possible** in my kitchen for 30 seconds. Bonus points if I do it in socks and nearly slip. It breaks the anxiety loop because suddenly I‚Äôm laughing at myself ‚Äî and that moment of levity is everything.

---

## 6. **Sleep, Food, and Screens ‚Äî The Trifecta We Ignore**

This one‚Äôs less sexy but wildly underrated. If I haven‚Äôt eaten in 6 hours, slept like trash, and just scrolled Reddit for two hours reading about *everything that could go wrong in the world*, guess what?

My brain‚Äôs gonna freak out.

It‚Äôs not weakness. It‚Äôs biology. Keep snacks handy. Set a bedtime (and stick to it like your life depends on it ‚Äî because some days, it kinda does). And, maybe, just *maybe*, get off your phone when your chest tightens.

---

## 7. **Rituals Are Underrated**

You know what keeps toddlers sane? Routine. Adults aren‚Äôt that different. Having little ‚Äúanchors‚Äù in your day ‚Äî making coffee slowly, journaling for five minutes, lighting a candle before bed ‚Äî they signal safety to your brain.

Some people swear by meditation. Others, by morning walks. I‚Äôm a fan of absurdly long showers where I argue with imaginary people in my head. Whatever works, honestly.

---

## 8. **Redefine ‚ÄúCoping‚Äù ‚Äî It‚Äôs Not About Perfection**

Coping doesn‚Äôt mean you have to feel amazing. It means you stayed grounded when everything screamed at you to run or freeze or freak out. Even if you only managed to breathe through it. Even if you sat on the floor and cried for five minutes before getting back up.

**That counts. That‚Äôs coping. That‚Äôs strength.**

---

## 9. **Collect Coping Mechanisms Like Pok√©mon**

Different days, different tools. Some days, a brisk walk clears my head. Others? I need a nap, a snack, and to not talk to anyone.

So ask yourself:
- What helped last time?
- What made it worse?
- What haven‚Äôt I tried yet?

This is your toolkit. Build it. Tweak it. Share it. And if you‚Äôre reading this thinking, *‚ÄúNothing works for me‚Äù* ‚Äî hey, that‚Äôs part of the process too. Don‚Äôt quit. Just keep collecting until something clicks.

---

## Final Thought

If you‚Äôve made it this far, maybe you‚Äôre currently battling that silent panic or just trying to prepare for the next wave. Either way, I see you. You‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôre not broken.

You‚Äôre just figuring out how to live in a loud world with a sensitive nervous system. And that? That takes courage every single day.

Let‚Äôs keep the conversation going: *What‚Äôs your best coping mechanism for anxiety or panic?*

Share it. You never know who might need it.

Suitcase ever unpacked, boarding onto planes.  
Seeing the world's beauty, always on your feet‚Äî  
But what if you had stayed with me, on our street?  
We‚Äôd walk all over the cracked pavement, still here,  
Nothing‚Äîstill the same old town, year after year.

**We would count the same cars and watch dusk settle in,**  
Linger under lamplight, letting quiet begin.  
We‚Äôd share slow coffee mornings, repeat well-worn lines,  
Laughing off your longing‚Äîall its obvious signs.

**I‚Äôd notice your silence, the way you‚Äôd look away,**  
At the distant horizon, not knowing what to say.  
Would your brown eyes hold the spark that once lit every dream,  
Or would you fade with the seasons and run out of steam?

**Maybe the awful rain would sound softer if you'd stayed;**  
Sundays would surely be less dull, and me less afraid.  
We‚Äôd even build a small shelter of common routine,  
Daydream about all the places we have never been.

**And you would always wonder what more you could be,**  
If you weren‚Äôt tethered to this worn place with me.  
Perhaps your restlessness would whisper loud at night,  
Crying to leave me forever, to make things right.

**I see you now, shining in photographs sent,**  
Your stories like postcards of all that you meant‚Äî  
Yet sometimes I wish, in another refrain,  
You had waited beside me and missed just one plane.

Not here to toss out a lazy ‚Äúhey‚Äù and disappear after three texts. I‚Äôm actually hoping to find someone I genuinely vibe with, something real, effortless, consistent. The kind of connection that feels like a soft place to land after a chaotic day.
I‚Äôm 19.Bit of an old soul, classic films are my thing (yes, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is peak cinema). I get lost in emotional story-based games, the kind that leave you wrecked in the best way. I write too ,poetry, short stories,mostly when my thoughts get loud.
I love books, learning new languages (currently deep into Japanese and German), and getting to know different cultures. I‚Äôd pick a sunrise in the mountains over a loud night at a club any day. Quiet coffee mornings, solo travel, long walks with no destination, that‚Äôs more my pace.My life‚Äôs kinda wild right now, I run a marketing agency, work remotely with a US-based company, and also manage an NGO and school for kids who deserve a better shot at life. So yeah, it gets busy. But everything I do, I do with heart.

What I‚Äôm hoping to find:
Someone I can build a long-term connection with. Someone to talk about life, music, weird dreams, or send voice notes at 2AM. Deep talks or silly memes,I‚Äôm down for both. I‚Äôm honest, respectful, and not here to waste time or play games.

We are wasting away so much food that we could be using that same money to fund more staff in the stores. Loses of $500 plus per day for the deli alone is not a sustainable business model. It would be ideal to make less food to have enough to cover rushes and that is it. Many love‚Äôs travel stops already come with an Arby‚Äôs, subway, or an another restaurant in them. I see no point in making more food to simply throw it away later. 


Don‚Äôt get me started on these ridiculous metrics that we all have to meet as well which just drain the energy out of everyone on the team. When I hear something is not getting done I look at my line of 3-5 people and ‚Äúsay do you expect me to be in two places at once?‚Äù This trend of putting more and more work on so little staff has got to stop for our sanity‚Äôs sake. All I am seeing at my love‚Äôs is us becoming more and more like Walmart everyday. We say we care about people and then those same people get targeted and thrown under the bus all because of a bad survey or bad metric for the day. 


Instead of looking at the bad leadership they blame the person on the ground actually trying to help the customers. Managers hide in their office chit chatting about the latest toys they bought or their own employees belittling them for their mistakes behind their backs. Managers that act like robots and meet metrics are praised while those who fail to meet metrics are shamed and pushed out of the company. People on the frontlines are made to enforce policies such as $2.99 for a coffee with just water in it or putting away totes at least 2-3 per day while dealing with coffee machines, long lines of customers, and messy floors. Each shift putting blame on the next shift never able to keep up with the demands of both the company and the customers. 


Even our fuel haulers Gemini and Kane say that they are seeing business in decline. I am inclined to agree that is the case. Our leadership is very poor at times and instead of them taking accountability for their actions they punish the frontline workers. Some managers are good not all are bad, but those that are rotten to the core know who they are. Shame on you all who are managers who don‚Äôt pull your fair share while the frontline workers deal with never ending tasks while trying to keep up with customers nonstop. There needs to be change at love‚Äôs starting with leadership that takes accountability for their actions. Until corporate office can get off of their duffs and do something all I see is this company spiraling into bankruptcy. ",1,1749106351.0,LovesTravelStops,0,1.0,False

Jessica froze. No matter how many times she'd been disappointed by Brian, every time she heard his cold tone, it still felt like a knife stabbing straight into her chest.

Her eyes lowered, and the smile on her face disappeared. ""Okay.""

Brian had expected Jessica to lash out, but he hadn't thought she'd give in so easily. Only then did he actually look at her.

He noticed Madeline was right‚ÄîJessica really had lost a lot of weight lately.

He thought, 'Maybe Jessica really was throwing up last night because she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she wasn't being jealous in front of Madeline after all.'

His lips pressed together, and his tone softened slightly. ""Madeline's been doing your job well. Your focus now should be taking care of Jake. I've explained this to you so many times‚Äîthere's nothing between me and her.

""Jessi, stop making trouble. Don't make me regret choosing you to be my wife.""

Jessica thought, 'Regret? I regret it too. I really regret giving up my family's business just to become this so-called Mrs. Atkinson. The Grant family has real status. Grant Group is powerful. I could've gone back and been the heiress everyone doted on instead.'

Jessica closed her eyes and calmly pulled out her resignation letter. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Atkinson, then please go ahead and approve this. I'll officially resign starting tomorrow.""

With that, she turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, Brian grabbed her arm.

""Jessica?"" Brian sounded surprised, as if he hadn't fully processed what was happening. Holding the resignation in one hand, he instinctively reached out and caught her.

He stared at her signature on the resignation letter. His face darkened as he held back a surge of anger. ""You're doing this to spite me? I thought you came today to make peace, but now you're taking it even further?""

""No, Mr. Atkinson. You said Atkinson Group didn't need me, and it just so happens‚ÄîI feel the same."" Jessica kept her gaze lowered, her thick lashes trembling slightly. ""It's been ten years. Atkinson Group isn't what it used to be.

""Since everyone clearly loves Madeline, I figured I might as well step down now instead of holding a position and collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.""

Brian let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp, like he could see straight through her excuse. ""Don't use the past ten years to guilt me. I know Atkinson Group wouldn't be what it is today without you. You were a great employee.

""But Jessica, ever since you had the baby, you haven't been involved in any business matters. I've been nothing but considerate. All you have to do is take care of our son, and you'll always be the lady of Atkinson Group.

""You can't even handle something this simple, and now you say you're stepping aside? All you're doing is putting Madeline in a difficult position. Jessica, I know you too well. You're calculating, but don't be cruel. Since last night, have you even apologized to Maddie?""

Jessica thought, 'Apologize? I'm supposed to apologize to the woman who wrecked my home? Shouldn't she be the one thanking me?'

Suddenly, Jessica let out a laugh and looked at Brian with a hint of curiosity. ""Yes, I'm cruel. Mr. Atkinson, have you never considered giving up?""

The kind of giving up she meant was divorce.

Over the past few years, whenever Brian and Jessica fought, she brought up divorce again and again, and every time it ended in an ugly stalemate.

Brian had never agreed. In his eyes, even if he cheated, Jessica was still his wife.

That was always how it was with Brian‚Äîdomineering and controlling, a man who held power over all of Hartdale.

As for Jessica, at the beginning, she hadn't really meant to leave. She had been acting out, like Brian said, hoping he'd actually care more about her.

But now, she was tired. She was fine with getting a divorce and going their separate ways. She even thought about the kids. They could each take one, and that would be that.

Brian's face darkened, his grip on her arm tightening like he could snap her in half. ""This is your last chance, Jessica. If you mess up again, I won't hesitate to find Jake a new mom.

""Do you know how many times he's complained to me he has no joy or freedom living with you? Why are you such a failure as both a wife and a mother?""

The word ""failure"" made her close her eyes and let out a long breath.

Jessica thought, 'So that's how it is. Waiting up all night for Brian to come home and making him hangover cures was a failure. Hand-washing his designer suits in the dead of winter until my hands were raw was a failure.

'Tutoring Jake through elementary math, raising a child who fit the Atkinson family's image of an heir was a failure. This home really has no place for me anymore.'

""I'm sorry, Mr. Atkinson,"" Jessica said sincerely. She believed someone who failed should take a final bow and leave the stage.

Her other hand slipped into her coat pocket and tapped her phone screen. The countdown began‚Äîthere were fourteen days left.

Once everything was in order, she would disappear completely. Brian would never have to be annoyed by her again.

Jessica's attitude caught Brian off guard. He still wanted to say something, but she didn't give him the chance and turned to leave.

She walked away without hesitation. Brian reached out again, but caught nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp pain clenched in his chest, a wave of panic rising fast and hard.

He frowned, watching her disappear down the hall, a strange sense growing stronger‚Äîthat something important was slipping further and further away from him.

Once outside, Jessica called her best friend, Gabriela Clark. They were besties, though they hadn't spoken in over six years.

Gabriela was a fashion designer, constantly flying around the country, tailoring clothes for different models. A lot of them were male, and with adults working in close quarters, it wasn't unusual for things to happen.

Put plainly, Gabriela went through boyfriends like outfits. Brian had always hated that about her. After Jessica had their child, he'd told her to stay away from Gabriela, said she'd be a bad influence on Jacob.

So Jessica had listened and cut ties with the friend she grew up with for six whole years.

After not hearing from Jessica for years, Gabriela was furious. She picked up and snapped, ""So you finally remembered I exist? Jessica, I thought you were way too far gone in your lovesick haze. And now you finally call‚Äîwhat, regretting it already?""

Jessica let out a helpless laugh, tears falling before she even noticed.

She hadn't cried when Brian humiliated her, hadn't cried when Madeline made a fool of her, not even when the child she carried for nine months called someone else Mom. But with Gabriela, Jessica sobbed in regret.

""Yes, I regret it,"" Jessica said. ""Gabi, if I come back now, is it too late?""

On the other end of the line, Gabriela went quiet for a long time after hearing Jessica's sincere words. When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.

She said, ""I'm just glad you've come to your senses. You idiot, do you have any idea how exhausting it's been running the studio for you all these years? The entire art world's been waiting for your return.

""Jessica, being a CEO's secretary only buried your talent. You were born to be an artist‚Äîyou're the last true gem of the Impressionist world. Jessi, I've been waiting for you this whole time.""

""I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm so sorry."" Jessica crouched down in the middle of the street, crying.

Jessica was always meant to be proud. She had been brilliant and talented from the start. Even Brian didn't know that she had studied fine art at a university in Fiorenelle, a city in Aurevia.

Her very first graduation piece had made it into the Viremont Grand Biennale, shocking the entire art world.

After graduation, the paintings she signed off on had sold at auction for more than a million dollars.

And yet, for the sake of so-called experience, she came back to the country and started over in a job that had nothing to do with her field. She studied admin, finance, and business management from scratch and still excelled at it.

She gave up painting for ten years. But today, she had finally decided‚Äîshe was going back.

# 4.Chapter 4 Her Ungrateful Son

After agreeing on a time with Gabriela to take over the studio, Jessica returned to Atkinson Villa.

She had given herself a 15-day countdown because ten years had left too many things unresolved. She couldn't just walk away. There were still matters to handle.

The most important of all was everything inside Atkinson Villa.

The massive villa, over 5,000 square feet, had no housekeepers simply because Brian thought they were too noisy. The daily cleaning had always fallen to Jessica.

Now that she was leaving, she intended to step down like the perfect secretary she'd always been. It was a matter of pride‚Äîas the heiress of the Grant family.

Madeline clearly wasn't the type to do housework, so Jessica had to find a qualified housekeeper for her husband and child.

During the day, Jessica interviewed several candidates, having each of them cook according to Brian's preferences. In the evening, as she was eating at home, an urgent voice came from the front door. ""Chester, call the family doctor. Now."" It was Brian.

Jessica, being pregnant, was especially sensitive to the smell of blood, and the air immediately made her nauseous.

She frowned, an instinctive worry rising. 'What happened? Is he hurt?' she pondered.

She instinctively started toward the door, only to see Brian hurrying in, carrying a woman in his arms. It was winter in Hartdale, snow falling steadily, soaking his hair and shoulders, but he didn't seem to notice.

He laid the woman down on the couch and barked, furious, ""Where is the family doctor? Hurry up.""

Jessica didn't even need to see the woman's face to know who she was. It was Madeline.

Wrapped in her thick robe, Jessica stood to the side and calmly asked, ""What happened to her?""

They had just argued in the morning. Brian glanced at Jessica but didn't seem interested in talking to her. His voice was filled with annoyance. ""She ran into some loan sharks and took a stab to the shoulder.""

""Loan sharks? Whose debt?"" Jessica asked, curious. She thought, 'What, has the CEO of Atkinson Group gone bankrupt?'

Before Brian could respond, Madeline, pale and weak, spoke up in a pitiful voice, ""I'm sorry, Jessi. It's my fault. My dad owes gambling debts, and somehow those people found out I was Mr. Atkinson's secretary.

""They waited on a dark road tonight and tried to kidnap me. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Atkinson was working late and happened to be there. If he hadn't shown up and saved me, I might've been killed.""

""Don't say things like that,"" Brian said sharply. ""As long as I'm around, no one will lay a finger on you. But your place isn't safe for now. I've already called the police. Until they catch those men, you'll stay at Atkinson Villa.""

""No."" Jessica didn't hesitate at all.

Hearing that, Brian looked up at her.

Jessica seemed in good spirits. Maybe it was because she had quit her job and reconnected with her best friend. Her cheeks were rosy, her skin glowing. She wore a soft silk robe, standing there lazily, full of charm.

Brian had been irritable since morning, but hearing Jessica's flat rejection actually calmed him down.

He turned his head, sneering with what looked like mockery. He thought, 'Just like I thought. Another game of push and pull. She acts like she's indifferent, but deep down she's still jealous of Madeline.'

His tone turned low and warning. ""Jessica, this is Atkinson Villa."" He was the one who owned this place. Whoever got to stay here was up to him.

""She still can't stay,"" Jessica said firmly. ""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

Atkinson Villa was big, spanning three full floors, but there were only three actual bedrooms.

One room was for Jacob, one for Jessica, and one for Brian. That was all there was.

There used to be extra guest rooms in Atkinson Villa, but back when Jessica and Brian were newlyweds and still happy, Brian had had them all remodeled.

There was a luxurious nursery, a walk-in closet, a display room for luxury goods, and spaces Jessica used to pass the time‚Äîlike a flower room, an art studio, and a yoga room. But there were no extra bedrooms.

In fact, the third bedroom was planned by Brian for their second child in the future. But back then, they never imagined that one day they'd be sleeping apart because of emotional distance.

Brian hadn't expected Jessica to reject Madeline's stay for this reason. His face instantly darkened.

His voice was tight, like he was clenching his teeth. ""Jessica, you sleep in the master bedroom.""

The implication was clear‚Äîthey could share a bed. After all, no matter how strained things had gotten, just three months ago, they had still slept together. That was how Jessica ended up pregnant.

But Jessica didn't care. That night had only happened because Brian was drunk three months ago. Back then, her feelings had been a tangled mess of love and resentment. Now, neither was left. There was no reason for them to be intimate anymore.

Jessica stood her ground, stubborn and unmoving, and the sight of it made Brian's anger boil over.

At that moment, Jacob came downstairs, still groggy from sleep. ""Dad, Mom, what's going on? I heard you two arguing again.""

He spoke with a pouty, wronged tone, then glanced over and saw Madeline on the couch, still bleeding as her wound was being treated. He snapped to attention. ""Maddie.""

Jacob ran over quickly. ""Maddie, what happened? Why are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Madeline smiled, patting his head, ""It's nothing, Jake. Be good and go back to bed.""

""I'm not going. You're hurt. I'm not sleeping until you're better."" Jacob was still a clingy child, and he clung to Madeline without letting go.

Seeing how much he liked Madeline, Jessica suddenly curved her lips into a smile. ""Jake, don't worry. Maddie might be staying with us for the next few days.

""But since we don't have enough bedrooms, would it be okay if Maddie sleeps in your room with you?""

""Really?"" Jacob's eyes widened, full of excitement and joy. ""Yeah, that'd be‚Äî""

Halfway through, he quickly clamped his hand over his mouth. ""No, I didn't mean it like that, Mom.""

Jacob thought, 'I totally forgot. Mom hates it when I act like I love Maddie. The last time I stayed out playing with Maddie too long and forgot to come home, Mom got super mad.

'After that, Dad told me I shouldn't let Mom see how much I love Maddie.'

""It's okay. You can mean it,"" Jessica said quietly, her voice soft as her cold hands beneath the robe rested gently over her belly.

Today, she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ungrateful child.

Jessica still remembered the day Jacob was born. She'd gone through a long labor for nearly two days. The doctors had said she might not survive and told Brian he had to choose whether to save the mother or the baby.

Brian's eyes had been bloodshot, screaming outside the OR that he only wanted Jessica.

But Jessica had refused. In tears, she'd begged the doctors to save the baby. She'd said she could give up everything, anything‚Äîjust not the child she shared with Brian.

In the end, she'd pulled through on sheer will, giving birth to Jacob naturally without a single dose of anesthesia.

Jessica gave up her career to raise Jacob herself, day in and day out. And now, what she got in return was a child who favored another woman and wanted a different mom.

Jessica was really tired. She hadn't even wanted to keep the baby she was carrying. When she got the results from last week's checkup, her first instinct had been to give it up.

Her life felt too hopeless. She hadn't planned on having another child with Brian.

But when she thought about leaving, Jessica started to feel a glimmer of hope. She thought that maybe this time, without the Atkinson family holding her back, she and her child could grow freely and things might be better.

With that thought, Jessica stopped looking back and walked away.

Jacob didn't understand why his mom was acting this way. He stood frozen, watching her leave, silent for a long time, and then suddenly burst into tears.

He was a sensitive kid. Even if he didn't understand anything, something deep in his blood told him he was being left behind.

His sudden crying startled Madeline. She quickly hugged him and tried to comfort him, ""Jake, don't cry. I'm right here. Don't be scared.""

She looked at Brian, nervous, her eyes brimming with tears like she was silently accusing Jessica of making Jacob cry again.

Brian's face was grim. He looked up toward the second floor, his eyes brooding. But in the end, he didn't say a word.

# 5.Chapter 5 She'd Had Enough

Jessica slept through the night without dreams. The next morning, when she came downstairs planning to make herself breakfast, she smelled food the moment she reached the stairs.

It was Madeline. She had already made breakfast for the whole family and was now grinding coffee for Brian by hand.

When she saw Jessica, she smiled and greeted her, ""Jessi, you're up. Come on, I made sandwiches. I'm not sure if you'll like them.""

""Maddie's cooking is great. Who wouldn't like it?"" Jacob chimed in with a bright smile, then sneaked a glance at Jessica. There was a flicker of fear in his expression. He was afraid of his mother, and he resented her too.

He felt like Jessica had suddenly become a different person. He didn't understand why she had looked at him with such a cold expression before.

Every time Jacob praised Maddie in the past, it would set Jessica off, making her try harder to be good to him‚Äîjust so he could use that as a chance to slack off from all his tutoring sessions.

Jessica could more or less guess what her son was thinking. She let out a faint, mocking smile and thought, 'Does he really think I, his mother, can't see through a kid's little tricks?'

Jessica had indeed resented Madeline out of jealousy in the past‚Äîbut only because she couldn't accept that her husband had such a close third party in his life.

As for how Madeline treated Jacob, Jessica had always turned a blind eye.

Jacob was the heir of the Atkinson family. After Jessica gave birth, Brian's mother, Paisley Atkinson, had warned her countless times not to slack off when it came to Jacob's education.

Jessica had always believed in a happy, low-pressure way of raising her child. She knew Jacob was a lively, sweet boy who loved comic books, playing games, and being in nature.

But as Brian's wife, and as the ever-watched Mrs. Atkinson in high society, she had to play the part of a strict and proper mother.

That was why Jacob always ran to his dad, complaining that his mom was too harsh.

What he didn't know was that, while Jessica was strict, she had read educational books from all over the world, doing her best to create a teaching method that balanced structure and rest.

Jessica might have seemed like a stern mother, but back when Madeline was still her intern, it was Jessica who had personally handed her a hand-drawn storybook she had made herself and asked her to use those toys to bond with Jacob.

Jacob's favorite dish‚Äîfish casserole‚Äîwas something Jessica had taught Madeline how to make, step by step.

Jessica never imagined that all the care and effort she once gave would turn into a weapon against her in the end. Her expression turned cold, touched with a kind of hopeless absurdity. ""What are you wearing?""

Madeline hadn't expected Jessica's first words to be that. She looked nervous. ""I-it's a suit. I didn't have any clothes to change into last night, so I grabbed something from the closet. Jessi, what's wrong?""

Jessica thought, 'What's wrong? A woman who doesn't belong in this house is wearing my clothes, making breakfast for my kid and grinding coffee for my husband‚Äîand she's asking me what's wrong?'

Brian seemed to sense Jessica was about to cause trouble again. He frowned and spoke first, ""Jessica, it's just clothes. Don't make a scene. I gave you a black card. You can go buy a hundred more.""

Hearing that, Jessica couldn't help but let out a snort. Her stomach turned. She couldn't even tell if it was the pregnancy or the fact that she hadn't eaten breakfast. ""Brian, did you forget that this piece was...""

It was the one she wore after the first time they slept together.

Back then, Jessica had been young, fresh out of school, filled with curiosity about the world.

At a business party, she'd thought she could help the company close a billion-dollar deal. She'd drunk too much with the client, only to realize later that her drink had been spiked. She'd ended up in bed with the company's CEO by mistake.

The next morning, she'd woken up to find her clothes torn to shreds by Brian. She couldn't go to work and had sat on the bed, blushing in frustration.

Brian had found her reaction cute and had his assistant buy her that custom-tailored suit. After that, he'd reassigned her to be his personal secretary.

Jessica remembered it clearly. That was how everything started between them.

She didn't expect Brian to forget. And now he let Madeline wear the very same outfit she once wore‚Äîit was disgusting.

Brian looked at Jessica's face, seeing she was holding something back. He gave a mocking smile, his deep-set eyes flashing with something strange. ""What is it? Say it. Jessica, are you really that attached to a piece of clothing?""

Madeline quickly sensed the tension in the air. She rushed over to explain, grabbed Jessica's hand tightly, and pleaded with her, her eyes brimming with tears, ""Jessi, don't be mad at Mr. Atkinson. He didn't know. I took it on my own.

""He just felt bad for me and didn't make me take it off. I didn't think you'd care so much. I'm sorry, Jessi. I'll go change right now. Please don't be upset.""

Jessica pulled her hand away in disgust. ""No need. You look good in it. Keep it. In fact, why stop at the suit? Just take anything you want from the walk-in closet. It's all yours. And not just that.""

Jessica looked up at Brian and mocked, ""Everything I ever had in this house is yours now, Madeline.""

""Jessica."" Brian finally lost it. He slammed the table and shouted, ""Do you have to push her like this?""

Jessica said, ""I'm not pushing her. You people are the ones pushing me.""

Her phone chimed. Jessica glanced down and saw the notification pop up‚Äîthirteen days left on the countdown.

At this rate, she might not even make it to the end of the countdown. She'd be gone before then.

Even Jessica hadn't expected Brian to be this heartless. Day by day, he kept crossing her line.

'Today it's the clothes. What will it be tomorrow?' she thought, when suddenly she caught a scent coming from Madeline.

Jessica pondered, 'Is that perfume?'

It drifted faintly at first, almost like a natural scent. But now that Jessica was standing closer, it hit her sharply.

She was sensitive to smells as it was. Her face turned pale in an instant, and her mind jumped back to the notes she had written at her desk‚Äî""3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

She thought, 'Well played, Brian. So that's how it is. As long as she's around, every rule can be broken, huh?'

Jessica let out a laugh, tears falling before she even realized it. In that moment, she couldn't wait for the countdown to end anymore. She wanted to leave now.

Her parents, her grandfather, and even her childhood best friend were waiting for her.

Jessica thought, 'What right does Brian have to let another woman humiliate me like this and treat everything I gave him over the past ten years like it meant nothing?'

""If you feel so pushed, then leave."" Brian stared at her coldly, finally snapping. ""You stay in this house acting like the world owes you something. Jessica, you've been talking about divorce, haven't you? Fine. Let's get divorced.""

Jessica's chest heaved as she struggled to breathe through her rising anger. ""Great. Then let's get a‚Äî""

Before the last word ""divorce"" could come out, she clutched her collar in pain, her breath quickening, her skin flushed all over, her eyes locked in disbelief on Madeline.

Jessica thought, 'Is that perfume floral?'

She gave a broken laugh, then said her last words, ""Brian, if you want me dead, just say it.""

Then everything went dark. She collapsed.

# 6.Chapter 6 Her Allergy

Five minutes later, a black Range Rover sped toward the hospital. In the back seat, Brian sat with a cold face, his eyes fixed on Jessica in his arms, never blinking.

The moment her eyelids moved, he saw it.

""Jessica, wake up,"" Brian said.

Jessica caught the faint cool scent on him and slowly opened her eyes. She was sitting on Brian's lap, leaning into his chest.

The moment her gaze met his brooding eyes, she seemed to catch a flash of joy in them.

""Why did you..."" The joy in Brian's eyes faded just as fast.

What he saw in hers was indifference. She got off him without a trace of hesitation and shifted to the side as she sat up, deliberately putting distance between them.

Brian raised an eyebrow, thinking she was still acting childish. ""Jessica, you're not a kid anymore. You knew you were allergic and still didn't go to the hospital.

""You just had to pass out right in front of me and Jake so we'd panic and fuss over you‚Äîwas that what you wanted?""

Maybe it was because Jessica's cold attitude had been getting to him these past two days, but the words Brian had meant as concern came out sounding more like an accusation.

Jessica silently clenched her fists at her sides. Her face, turned toward the window, looked pale.

Seeing her like that only annoyed Brian more. He grabbed her chin and forced her to look at him. ""Say something. You went this far hurting yourself just to play the victim.

""Now both Jake and I are taking you to the hospital in person, and you still want to sit there pretending not to care?""

Jessica gritted her teeth and slapped his hand away. She gave a bitter smile. ""Playing the victim? Brian, are you pretending not to know I'm allergic to floral scents, or did you just forget?""

Brian's brows furrowed tightly. His already grim expression turned colder. He looked at Jessica like he was indulging her for being unreasonable.

Jessica thought, 'Forget it. What's the point in saying all this now?'

All of a sudden, it just felt meaningless. None of it mattered to her anymore.

Noticing the other two gazes in the car, she looked up. In the front seat, Madeline watched the scene unfold with a wide-eyed look of innocence while Jacob nestled in her arms.

When Jessica looked over, he pouted in annoyance, as if blaming her for overreacting and disturbing everyone.

But no matter how she looked at it, after she passed out from an allergic reaction, neither Brian nor Jacob had worried about her first. They only thought she was using it to manipulate them.

They were even afraid she'd take it out on Madeline and silently shielded her, taking her side.

""Jessi, are you okay?"" Madeline's eyes welled with tears, as if she were truly worried about Jessica. She handed her a bottle of water with gentle concern. ""Don't be scared. We'll be at the hospital soon. Mr. Atkinson, Jake, and I are right here with‚Äî""

Jessica smacked her hand away without mercy. The slap rang out sharp and loud.

Madeline let out a muffled gasp, as if it really hurt, but she bit her lip and endured it. The back of her delicate hand reddened.

""Mom, why are you always so mean to Maddie? I really don't like you anymore."" Jacob's voice turned shrill as he shouted at Jessica, clutching Madeline's hand tightly and blowing softly on it. ""Shoo shoo, Maddie's ouchie will go away.""

Jessica's lips trembled. She started to speak but stopped, her eyes slowly closing. What she saw in front of her felt like a stab to the heart.

Jacob had always been energetic. For a little boy like him, bumps and bruises were quite normal.

Whenever that happened, he would pout, throw his little arms around Jessica, and cry with that wronged, adorable face of his.

And every time, Jessica would blow on the bruised spot and say, ""Shoo shoo, Mommy's magic breath will make your pain go away.""

As soon as she blew on it, Jacob would stop crying, snuggle up to her for a bit, then bounce away to play again.

But now, watching the boy she'd once held so dearly comfort another woman as if she were his mother, Jessica felt like the whole thing was a cruel joke.

Brian and Jacob didn't notice the flicker of triumph in Madeline's eyes or the smug challenge in her gaze when it met Jessica's.

""All better now, Jake. You're so sweet. It doesn't hurt anymore. Jessi didn't use any real force,"" Madeline said, her eyes red. She let Jacob rub her hand a few times before tucking it behind her back, then looked up, shooting Brian a pitiful glance.

""Jessica, apologize to Madeline."" Brian's voice was cold, tinged with impatience.

Jessica turned to him, stunned. ""You want me, the victim, to apologize to her?"" Furious, she let out a dry laugh. ""She's the one who triggered my allergic reaction and knocked me out. Should I be thanking her instead?""

Madeline had started off as her intern. Jessica had practically taught her everything. There was no way she didn't know about Jessica's allergy to floral scents.

Jessica had already sensed something was off when she caught that faint fragrance at Atkinson Villa. It turned out that she'd fallen for it anyway.

""Mr. Atkinson, no need to make Jessi apologize. I know she misunderstood me."" Madeline forced a smile. She looked all pitiful, like she didn't want Jessica to get the wrong idea again.

""Don't speak up for her,"" Brian remarked, his eyes chilling. ""You've always been too forgiving toward her.""

Jessica caught the subtext. Brian meant that he had been too forgiving toward her too. Once again, he didn't hesitate to take Madeline's side.

Jessica thought, 'Then what am I to him? I'm his wife.' A sudden tightness gripped her belly, pain rolling in waves.

She thought of the baby. Instinctively, she rested a hand over her stomach, her lips pressed tight nervously, unwilling to explain anything more.

The tension inside the car was thick, but luckily, they arrived at the hospital soon after. Brian got out first. ""Jessi, your health matters. Don't let your temper hurt you in the end.""

Inside the car, Jacob was too young to pick up on the sharp sarcasm and challenge laced in Madeline's words. He simply thought she was kind-hearted and still cared about the mom he believed to be cold and heartless.

At that, Jessica's face turned even paler as she clutched her stomach, staring coldly at Madeline. ""I was stupid enough to help you back then. That's why things ended up like this. I'll take the consequences.""

With that, she pulled the door open and tossed out a final line before stepping out. ""You'd better watch yourself from now on.""

She thought, 'Did she really think being Brian's wife was going to be that easy?'

But Madeline didn't take her words seriously at all. She pondered, 'Once I get Jessica out of the picture, I'll be the only woman he still keeps around. Becoming his wife will be a piece of cake.'

Jessica had only taken a few steps before a wave of dizziness hit. Just as she was about to collapse, Brian caught her.

""Call a doctor. Now,"" Brian shouted. ""Somebody help.""

He could feel her trembling slightly in his arms. Her beautiful face was drained of all color, and something about it made Brian panic.

Soon, a few nurses from the hospital rushed over with a stretcher, and Jessica was wheeled into the emergency room.

""The patient's having a severe allergic reaction. We need to administer...Wait, Ma'am, do you have any known drug allergies?"" the doctor asked routinely in the ER.

Jessica placed a hand over her belly. ""Doctor, I'm pregnant. I can't take any meds.""

""You're pregnant?"" The doctor looked shocked. Then he said, ""Your allergic reaction is critical. If we don't get you treated right away, you could experience nerve failure and suffocate.""

""Just treat me with whatever's safe for the baby,"" Jessica insisted, holding on to what little consciousness she had. ""And one more thing‚Äîdon't tell my husband I'm pregnant.""

""B-but this goes against protocol. If anything happens‚Äî""

""I'm the heiress of Grant Group. Whatever happens, I'll take full responsibility. Please.""

Before Jessica could finish her sentence, she collapsed on the operating table.

Outside the ER, Brian stared at the glowing light above the door, his fists clenched without realizing it. He thought, 'It's just an allergic reaction. Jessica's going to be fine.'

He let out a slow breath and tugged at the hem of his shirt, only to feel something damp. His eyes instantly widened.

He thought, 'Blood? Is this Jessica's blood?'

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only..........","**1.Chapter 1 Her Regret**

In the empty room, Jessica Atkinson held a paintbrush in her hand, listening to her mother's weary voice over the phone.

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?""

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three.

Just as Stella thought she'd failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, ""Okay.""

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. ""Y-you're saying yes?""

""Yes."" Jessica's voice was calm. ""I'll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I'll be back in 15 days.""

After a few more words, she ended the call.

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room.

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch‚ÄîBrian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh.

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control.

This was Jessica's husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family's arrangement and cutting ties with them.

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone.

Beside them, a boy around five years old with delicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman's arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, ""Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?""

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. ""Of course.""

Jacob's eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, ""Maddie, you're the best. Not like my mom‚Äîshe never lets me eat too much."" As he spoke, he even pouted a little.

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, ""Then you've got to eat a little extra today, Jake.""

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. ""Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.""

Madeline's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob's diet because she didn't want him to get sick. That was all.

Jessica didn't feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room.

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. ""Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Jake's birthday together.""

Madeline used to be Jessica's intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent.

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn't find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married.

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she'd end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family.

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place‚Äîto become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son.

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, ""I'm not feeling well. I'm not going.""

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, ""Jessi, you're Jake's mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.""

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh.

She figured this was between her and Madeline. Jacob was still just a child who shouldn't be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday.

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline's shoulder, completely ignoring her.

For a split second, Madeline's smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after.

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused.

Ten years ago, she'd joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They'd fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family's carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it.

For the past ten years, she'd never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life.

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline's presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect.

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging over the sink.

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic.

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. ""Mr. Atkinson, what's going on with Jessi?""

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, ""She's been like this lately. It's nothing. Don't worry.""

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, ""What's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?""

Jessica didn't respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, 'If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me?

'Forget it. I'm leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress.'

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, ""Mr. Atkinson, don't say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn't feeling well. She's lost a lot of weight lately.""

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. ""Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.""

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline's face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away.

She hadn't even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand.

""Ow!"" Madeline cried out.

""Maddie,"" Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red.

Jacob's eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. ""Maddie, does it hurt a lot?""

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. ""It's okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn't hurt.""

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. ""What are you trying to pull now?""

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline's eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, ""I didn't do anything.""

But Brian didn't believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep-set eyes as well.

He said accusingly, ""Jessi, you've changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.""

Jessica thought, 'I've changed? Yeah, I have.'

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn't have gone dull from staying up all night.

And she definitely wouldn't have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian's words‚Äîonly to be replaced by another woman.

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs.

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had.

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn't bear to be apart.

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room.

From this moment on, she wouldn't disturb them again.

# 2.Chapter 2 She Was Done Playing Along

The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn't bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning.

Since she'd already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group.

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Atkinson Group's rise to the number-one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn't come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share.

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light.

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay-at-home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed.

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless‚Äîlike fish washed up on the shore.

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot.

One said, ""Did you see Madeline's Instagram post?""

Another asked, ""No, what did she post this time?""

Someone else added, ""She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.""

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze.

One of them gasped, ""Ms. Grant?""

Another asked, ""Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?""

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left.

Someone sneered, ""What a buzzkill. What's the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?""

Another said sarcastically, ""She's already the CEO's wife. What's the point of showing off in front of us?""

Someone else snorted, ""I don't think Mr. Atkinson's that close to her anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting a divorce.""

Jessica didn't react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk.

If she hadn't gone through so much workplace bullying in the past‚Äîif Brian hadn't stepped in and helped her so many times‚Äîshe wouldn't have fallen for him to begin with.

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine-photo post from Madeline.

The first image was taken at Jacob's birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three-tier cake in the center was impossible to miss.

What caught Jessica's eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other‚Äîit looked so warm and loving.

Jessica thought, 'It was just a burn. Why'd they go to the hospital again?'

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well-wishes.

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\]

Another joked: \[Showing off again‚Äîso who's your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\]

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family's together, that's what really matters.\]

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian.

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn't have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start.

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn't care anymore.

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like.

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO's office and handed them to Brian's current personal assistant.

The people in the Secretary's Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock.

Someone asked, ""I-I didn't read that wrong, did I?""

""Ms. Grant is quitting?"" another exclaimed.

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. ""M-Ma'am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he's done.""

""No need. I'm just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,"" Jessica said with a light smile.

People around them sighed under their breath.

""Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?""

""Why Madeline? Doesn't she have a family?""

""Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson's. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""Now that Jessica's quitting, maybe she's handing the position over.""

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would've crushed her. She would've curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers.

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered.

She smiled at everyone like she couldn't hear a word and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.""

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she'd accumulated over the years.

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she'd bought when she first started out and notes she'd taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary.

On one page, it clearly said: ""1. He needs a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica's effort.

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man's plaything‚Äîthat all it took was a body, not a brain.

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night‚Äîreviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature.

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her.

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust.

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first.

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, 'Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me?

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she'd just been horribly wronged.

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary's Office, he saw Jessica there at the office.

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection.

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue.

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica's desk, and ordered, ""Come in.""

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. ""Okay.""

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. ""The company doesn't need you right now. If there's no special reason, don't come to Atkinson Group again.""

For example, with a recommendation bot, if every day before, at 7 am, the owner of the bot always drinks coffee, then by¬†**rule-based reasoning**, the bot¬†is going to¬†recommend that action today for the owner. Maybe these routines of the owner can be detected by a heuristic algorithm or it is a constant action of his, so reasoning without LLM can be efficient¬†in certain cases - something even outperforming reasoning using LLMs.

However, reasoning without LLMs can be limited by scalability issues related to knowledge, datasets, and the number of detectable contexts.¬†Nowadays, there are a lot of solutions for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLM or an LLM-integrated system but in general, they are in one of 6 groups below:

* **Pretraining**
* **Supervised Finetuning**
* **LLM Architecture Design**
* **Alignment Training**
* **In-Context Learning**
* **Autonomous Agent**

Regarding¬†**Pretraining**,¬†**LLM Architecture Design**, and¬†**Alignment Training**, I will not focus much on them because these methods require high computation costs rather than the remaining ones, in my research time, I only concentrate on the way to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM-integrated system with the¬†cost¬†(both time and computing consumption) as low as possible. So, we will concentrate on three other groups:¬†**Supervised Finetuning**,¬†**In-Context Learning**, and¬†**Autonomous Agent**.

# In-Context Learning

I think we should¬†start our first session with a game of imagination.¬†We imagine that an LLM is also a girl¬†who is¬†studying at a primary school. What about the capabilities of her?

* Her language capabilities are similar to what an LLM gains through¬†**pretraining**¬†(finishing the mask modeling as filling in the space exercises)
* Her knowledge and every capability obtained like the LLM after¬†**supervised¬†finetuning**¬†(math, literature, history,‚Ä¶)
* Her brain is also like a human brain, and one of the most difficult things to explain and understand is the mechanism, which all of the researchers in the world are trying to improve day by day, this work called¬†**LLM Architecture Design**¬†(for example, Transformer or DeepSeek Architecture)
* She learns from her mistakes, similar to how an LLM improves through¬†**alignment training**.

So, if we give her¬†a¬†exercise, if she¬†know¬†how to solve it, she solves it normally. If she does not know how to solve it, we should give her¬†an instruction to solve¬†step-by-step,¬†she¬†will¬†by¬†herself¬†think about each step. Moreover, if we give her a knowledge question, if she does not know it, we should search Google and give her a reference.¬†They¬†are called¬†**In-Context Learning**.

**Few-shot prompting**¬†can provide a few examples of similar problems she must solve.¬†**Chain-of-Thought**¬†can break a dish recipe into many steps she should follow.¬†**Meta-prompting**¬†gives many rules such as the structure, and syntax of the solution she must answer. And they are calling LLM only 1 times.

**Self-consistency**¬†makes her draw many pictures and select the best one.¬†**Generate Knowledge Prompting**¬†makes her write relevant information before answering the question.¬†**Prompt Chaining**¬†helps her break the exercise into many steps but¬†give¬†her each exercise for each step.¬†**Tree-of-Thought**¬†like Prompt Chaining but each step has many ways to finish.

**Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART), ReAct Prompting (Reason and Action)**, and¬†**Reasoning without Observation (ReWOO)**¬†simulate using external tools while solving tasks‚Äîalternating between reasoning and action.

Besides, there are many methods to improve¬†the¬†instruction for students¬†easy¬†finish exercises more easily.¬†**Automatic Prompt Engineer**¬†using¬†many correct samples of exercise - solution for the best experts to generate many instructions,¬†then¬†with which instruction¬†the student gets the highest score will be chosen.¬†**Active Prompt**¬†improves few-shot prompting by selecting the questions that can be answered with the highest uncertainty percentage, and then annotating them to make the prompt more general (overcome the optimal solution direction of few-shot prompting).

# Autonomous Agent and Memory Management

Because multi-agent systems are among the most prominent trends today,¬†so I will have a short comment about it, only a brief.

First, we should start with¬†a comparison between¬†In-Context Learning and Multi-agent¬†for enhancing¬†the reasoning capability of an LLM-integrated system, especially for SLM.¬†In-context learning requires fewer resources, is¬†simple, andfocuses only on input design. In contrast, multi-agent systems require significant resources, are complex to implement, and only perform efficiently when correctly and appropriately designed‚Äîsomething that is often challenging. Especially,¬†**CMD**¬†show that a single-agent LLM with strong prompts can achieve nearly identical performance to the best existing discussion approach across various reasoning tasks and backbone LLMs. They find that multi-agent discussion outperforms a single agent only when the prompt lacks demonstrations.

Here are a few notable frameworks for Multi-agent systems:

* **Debate**¬†replicates a simple turn-based discussion among agents. All agents receive prompts to address the assigned task. Their responses are then incorporated into each agent's input for the next round. This process typically involves three rounds of discussion.
* **MAD (Multiagent Debate)**¬†introduces divergent thinking by involving two participants who discuss a task from opposing perspectives. A judge then evaluates which viewpoint seems more plausible or determines if further discussion is needed. The process continues until¬†either¬†a consensus is reached or the judge favors a particular solution.
* **Reconcile**¬†uses multiple LLMs (ChatGPT, Bard, Claude2) with stages: feedback generation with confidence estimation, multi-round discussion, and confidence-based voting.
* **CMD**¬†is a general discussion framework for achieving consensus through iterative interaction.

Next, we come to an LLM integrated system with only individual agents and the way many agents interact together indirectly, through¬†**Memory System**.

In the agent system,¬†we should distinguish between¬†the¬†**Memory System**¬†and¬†**RAG.**¬†While both Memory Systems and RAG provide information to LLMs, they differ in two key aspects:

* RAG brings external knowledge at the inference time, but the Memory System stores provided information and controls it every time, instead of inference time.
* RAG is fundamentally stateless, while the Memory System is stateful. RAG¬†has no awareness¬†of previous interactions, user identity, or how the current query relates to past conversations, but Memory System has.

Memory Systems for agents in general are so diverse that I will give an example of¬†the way¬†to manage memory systems for chatbot agents. In a chatbot system, for¬†example, Chatgpt, we will have some circumstances:

* The system needs context from the conversation history so a core-memory is necessary for the system. It contains the profile of the user which is collected to direct the Memory System followed as user-directed Memory, and¬†also contains the recent conversation history of the user.
* When the conversation history is large enough and the storage is limited, a history summarization memory is required to store the key information such as events, meetings, and¬†notable information contained in the conversation history of the user and bot.

So, the collaboration between the agents and the Memory is¬†very important. With the chatbot system above, maybe we need at least three agents, one for profiling user profiles, one for summarizing the conversation history, and¬†one for communicating with users. The profile builder and summarization agents can potentially run in the background, so their real-time responsiveness is less critical than that of the communication agent. That depends on the¬†design of the system¬†we build between agents and the memory system.

That‚Äôs also the end of my research about¬†**Reasoning**¬†with¬†**In-Context Learning**¬†and¬†**Agents with Memory Management**.",1,1749105335.0,StartupAI,0,1.0,False

As the title says I want to know if some of you have some tips for the summer time now? Alhamdulillah I haven't missed prayers yet, but I am still really struggling to keep awake until Isha and wake up for Fajr. I work about 9-9.5 hours a day and have to be at work early every day unfortunately.

I rediscovered Islam not that long ago (maybe 2.5 years) but I haven't been able to pray all prayers on time until the beginning of this year when I went to Umrah with my husband (of 1 year now). After we came back, we were determined to devote to Allah SWT and our prayers fully. 

However, I don't know how to get enough sleep with the prayer times being really late/early now that summer time is coming. I am trying my best, but I am so tired every day and cannot function without at least 1 strong Matcha and 1-2 coffees throughout the day. I also have no possibility to take a nap during work as I have to be present at the reception at all times during working hours. My lunch break is only 30 minutes and during it I would like to eat because I get really hungry lol.

Any help or advice is much appreciated. May Allah bless you all. Have a lovely and blessed day of Arafah and Eid inshaallah. <3",8,1749105244.0,Hijabis,1,1.0,False

I was travelling the next day, so this was sort of an event, our last time seeing each other for quite a few days. 

As we were walking together, we came across a couple, and my girlfriend commented on how the woman looks too pretty for the man. In all honesty, there was quite a stark difference between how both looked, but I told her you never know what that man offers her in a non-physical sense.

I then went on to jokingly ask her ""So if I didn't look good, you wouldn't have talked to me, and we wouldn't be together?"". She goes on to casually say ""You're not good looking, you're average looking"". I paused for a moment and then told her ""Sorry what?"". She replied ""Yeah, you're average looking"". She repeated the statement a few times, everytime I'd ask her ""You're joking, right?"". And everything she'd just reiterate her statement.

I immediately felt so numb, then so mad, but I didn't even have words for it. She kept apologising, saying that she didn't mean it that way and that I'm the only guy she has eyes for because of everything else that I offer her, and that she doesn't think there's a more attractive guy than me. Quite frankly, most of her words meant nothing to me because I couldn‚Äôt even feel anything at all. She then tried to make me forget by kissing me and making me touch her in public, and then when my mood still didn't fully change, she got so mad and was going to leave me and go home, because she had been apologising to me for 30 minutes and all throughout she was saying ""Can you please not be upset?"" like it was some sort of pressure to forgive her in that very moment. And later on in the day she said that I ruined our last day out together before I travelled. I had to be the one who compromised their feelings so she doesn't feel upset, or go back home feeling upset. 

It's been a few days now and this has been on my mind since then. She has been supporting and loving ever since but I just can't get my head around what she said. I know I'm not the most good-looking human, but I was always confident of my looks and how I present myself. In fact, I never even truly cared about that side of things. But I can't be with someone who I plan to call my wife, and yet she thinks I'm just an average looking person, and that in her eyes, there are many better looking guys out there. I believe her when she says that she only sees me, because I offer her so much in everything there is I could offer, and I do it out of love for her. But I also don't believe her when she tells me to forget what she said because she didn't meant it.

No, she did mean it, it was her opinion.
The thing about her that you should know is that she's very naive and so many times I'd feel like I'm dealing with someone with the emotional understanding of a child. So part of me believes that she didn't say it with malice intended. But I just can't get her words out of my mind.

I don't know what to do now, how to feel like, or how to interact with her. Part of me questions if I should still be with her at all. I try to carry on as if nothing happened, but every while I remember what she said and I feel so upset. This isn't a one-off, that's the thing. She regularly says and does things that make me feel iffy. Im not sure I want to be with someone who I know eventually will hurt me again and again.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a coffee grinder for espresso requires careful consideration of several key features. The burr type, grind settings, motor power, and overall build quality all play significant roles in achieving the perfect espresso grind.

**Burr Type:** Conical vs. Flat

Conical burrs are known for producing a bimodal grind distribution, which some argue enhances the body and sweetness of espresso. They also tend to operate at lower speeds, generating less heat and preserving the volatile aromatics of the coffee. Flat burrs, on the other hand, produce a more uniform grind size, which can lead to greater clarity and precision in the espresso. Ultimately, the choice between conical and flat burrs is a matter of personal preference.

**Grind Settings:** Stepless vs. Stepped

Stepless grind adjustment allows for infinite control over the grind size, enabling precise dialing in of your espresso. This is particularly beneficial for experienced baristas who seek maximum control over their extraction. Stepped grind settings offer predetermined grind sizes, making them more user-friendly for beginners. While less precise, stepped grinders still provide a good range of grind options for espresso.

**Motor Power:** RPM and Torque

The motor's power and speed (RPM) are crucial for consistent grinding, especially when dealing with dense, oily beans. A powerful motor with sufficient torque ensures that the grinder can handle the resistance of the beans without stalling or overheating. Lower RPMs are generally preferred, as they generate less heat and preserve the coffee's flavor.

**Build Quality and Materials:** Stainless Steel vs. Plastic

The durability and longevity of a coffee grinder are largely determined by its build quality and the materials used in its construction. Stainless steel components, such as the burrs and housing, are more resistant to wear and tear than plastic alternatives. A robust build quality ensures that the grinder can withstand daily use and maintain its performance over time.

Key features of the best coffee grinders for espresso include:
 * High-quality burrs (conical or flat)
 * Stepless grind adjustment
 * Powerful motor with low RPM
 * Durable build quality with stainless steel components

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality coffee grinder for espresso offers numerous benefits that can significantly enhance your espresso brewing experience. From improved flavor extraction to increased consistency and efficiency, a good grinder is a worthwhile investment for any espresso enthusiast.

**Improved Flavor Extraction:** A consistent and precise grind is essential for optimal flavor extraction. A high-quality grinder ensures that the coffee particles are evenly sized, allowing for uniform saturation and extraction during the brewing process. This results in a more balanced and flavorful espresso shot, with enhanced sweetness, acidity, and body.

**Enhanced Consistency:** Consistency is key to achieving repeatable results in espresso brewing. A reliable grinder delivers a consistent grind size from shot to shot, minimizing variations in extraction time and flavor. This allows you to fine-tune your brewing parameters and consistently produce high-quality espresso.

**Increased Efficiency:** A powerful and efficient grinder can significantly reduce the time and effort required to grind your coffee. A grinder with a strong motor and well-designed burrs can quickly and effortlessly grind the beans to the desired fineness, saving you time and energy. This is particularly beneficial for those who brew multiple espresso shots per day.

 ## FAQs Section

Choosing the right coffee grinder for espresso can be confusing, especially with the abundance of options available. Here are some frequently asked questions to help clarify the decision-making process.

**What is the difference between conical and flat burrs?**

Conical burrs are typically slower and produce a bimodal grind distribution, which some believe enhances the body and sweetness of espresso. Flat burrs are generally faster and produce a more uniform grind size, leading to greater clarity and precision. The best choice depends on your personal preference and the type of espresso you enjoy.

**How important is stepless grind adjustment?**

Stepless grind adjustment offers infinite control over the grind size, allowing for precise dialing in of your espresso. This is particularly beneficial for experienced baristas who seek maximum control over their extraction. However, stepped grind settings can be sufficient for beginners and those who prefer a more user-friendly experience.

**What should I look for in terms of motor power?**

Look for a grinder with a powerful motor that can handle the resistance of the beans without stalling or overheating. Lower RPMs are generally preferred, as they generate less heat and preserve the coffee's flavor. The specific power requirements will depend on the type of beans you typically use and the amount of espresso you brew.
