I just switched to a collapsible kettle as the canister that I used previously was only big enough for one cup of coffee and took over 8 minutes to heat up. This one collapses to a smaller size, heats up to 700 ml in about 8 minutes.

1jfvgzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/reacher/comments/1jfvgzw/quinns_deal_makes_no_sense/,Quinn's deal makes no sense,"So he's selling guns to a domestically-based sleeper cell. In a country where getting hold of an assault rifle is only marginally harder than buying a coffee. And where a bomb would be 10x as efficient in killing civillians anyway (you make money selling arms in bulk to rebels/insurgent armies, not tiny terror cells).

Yet this deal for presumably just a handful of guns is apparently so big that it's enough to pay off his debts to the Russian Mafia, and keep his dozen or so mooks employed. And he needs it because he's basically broke.

Except he was selling arms for at least 5 years prior while based out of Chicago. As well as selling military secrets for god knows how long prior. So where did his money go?

The plot only works if you're willing to believe that Quinn is a genius mastermind who seemingly forgot where his money was stashed, and his only recourse was to borrow money from extremely dangerous people so he could sell guns at 10x the price to people who could just as easily get them from a gun store, and would be better off building a bomb anyway.

Oh, and he's borrowed money from the mob, despite holding Beck to ransom (who clearly has millions in assets as a successful arms dealer himself) instead of simply forcing him to give the seed money to Quinn instead.

Which seeing as he's using Beck's logistics, wouldn't even be that much. It's literally just the cost of goods.",1,1742494423.0,reacher,0,1.0,False

Or block them. Most movements are sabotaged by ""what ifs"" and ""buts"" and in our subReddit a fair bit of that has been done by American trolls.

2) Stick together. We have special interest groups demanding special treatment (ie, Starbucks workers asking us to exempt and buy their US coffee because Starbucks give them tuition help). 

3) Any job losses will be absorbed as new business start and local business expand. Many US companies overwork employees to have less employees. We can do better.

4) Turn over products that are US so that the next shopper knows and doesn't have to search or read labels. Makes shopping for local much easier.

5) Try to get the movement into the media. After we did that, the number of people who joined our subReddit and had so much to contribute about products we didn't know about joined. They have been invaluable.

6) Remember that some people who have limited income cannot contribute or contribute very much. We tell them not to worry, that we've got them! Look out for each other and tell people not to risk their health by boycotting something.

7) Cross post when suitable so that we share what we are doing.

8) We share a lot of laughs

Hi everyone! I'm looking for roommate to move into a 2x2 apartment at Cortland Lakecrest (formerly Lodge at Lakecrest.) My current roommate will be moving out at the end of our lease on July 5th, and the master bedroom will be available next day as I’d like to renew in this apartment!  

Information & Perks!

- Monthly costs, which include rent, utilities, electricity, and Wifi add up to ~$1250-$1300. 
- The master bedroom will be unfurnished, it has a private bathroom and a spaceous walk-in closet!
- The shared space in the apartment is fully furnished at the moment, but due to couch damages, I intend to replace those once my current roommate moves out. 
- This is a renovated apartment with wooden floors, no carpet whatsoever 
- In-unit Washer and Dryer
- Parking is included
- If you’re a student at USF, campus is 5 minutes away and there’s two Bull Runner bus stops right by the complex
- Monthly resident events! 
- The neighborhood is pretty clean and quiet, and there’s a pool, a gym, a private movie theater, outdoor grilling stations, and a path walk around the lake! Everything is currently being renovated due to new ownership, so a lot of the amenities will look brand new! 

About me:
I’m 25 and I currently work full-time in clinical research, my job is hybrid so I do work from home a couple days of the week. I do have an orange cat, he is very sweet and playful. Preferably no other pets, but I would be open to another cat! I love movies, coffee shops and markets, and I occasionally go out with friends in St. Pete! I’m also quiet, organized, and very clean!! I’m looking for a female roommate, preferably close to my age, a student or working professional, queer-friendly, and who would want to be friends as well! 

If interested, please message me! I can provide pictures of the place and a breakdown of the costs :) ",1,1742494084.0,USF,0,1.0,False

Full disclosure, the end result tastes pretty good, but it takes way too much time to get there. I have a standard Wawa coffee tumbler that I use every day at work, and it no joke takes 20 minutes to actually fill it with coffee. It has made me late before, which is admittedly on me.

Here are the things I’ve tried:

* Varying the grind: I don’t actually have a grinder but my local coffee shop has been happy to help experiment with grinding. This is likely meaningless information, but I’ve tried everything from 3 up to 4.3 in terms of grind settings. Maybe that means something to someone, but the result has always been the same in terms of time; the course grind still clogs but just tastes more watered down.
* Varying temperature: I usually do 200*, but I’ve tried +- 5*. Doesn’t make a difference.
* The two swirl between pour method: every time I pour, I swirl. I’ve tried it manually, or just with a spoon. Doesn’t help.
* I use genuine Kalita wave 185 filters. They are every bit as good or bad as the generic filters that fit poorly that I can get at the dollar store.
* Espresso pick filter: the amendment that lead me to write this post. Everyone says these things open up the Kalita Wave. Literally no difference except I’m $15 poorer.

I’m seriously about to drill the holes open, I’m tired of nannying this thing and still not getting what I want. I bought it over the V60 because I was new to pour over and they say it is forgiving, but I’d way rather have a device that actually functions but requires technique.

recently I met an old friend for coffee and as a meeting point I set a Warhammer store. The store guy immediately saw the fire of potential nerdery in my friends eyes and gifted him the store Space Marine.

Now my friend has started watching YT videos on the lore and the needle is in the arm. So, where do we go from here?

As some context: 

I do not play Warhammer 40K as of now. I have read a ton of lore, listened to the audiobooks and have an embarrassingly substantial 40K collection for someone who does not play.

 I do play other wargames however and this led me to the question of how to get people in with a very small game mode in the setting.

 Now there is so many on offer: Kill Team, Necromunda, Combat Patrol, Incursion. 

Which one would you recommend to someone who is probably going to join for lore and model-building reasons? Is Combat Patrol fun? I am reading mixed opinions. 

To be clear: I have all the paints and wargaming experience. I can give him a helping hand. So my question is, which ""small"" 40K should I use to get him to the table? 

Looking forward to reading your opinions and recommendations!

I (25M) fly for work relatively often, and usually grab a coffee in the terminal if I have time. When I was getting coffee this week, the barista told me I looked familiar and asked me a few questions about myself, and I had assumed she was just trying to figure out if she knew me from somewhere. I kept answering her questions trying to be helpful even though I was fairly certain we’d never met. We were talking for maybe 2 minutes before someone got in line behind me and I moved to wait in the pickup area, but not before she handed me my receipt. I didn’t think much of it until I got my coffee and found my gate, when I looked and saw she wrote her number on it.
This made my day when I realized, since I’d never been handed a number like that before. Buuuut, I threw it out and never called because I have a girlfriend I’ve been dating for 4 years. I wasn’t trying to lead this barista on or anything, I just try to be kind to service workers because I’ve been in those jobs and know that sometimes a nice customer can make those shifts bearable. 
Anyways, here’s where I ask for 2 pieces of advice:
1. Do I tell my girlfriend this person gave me her number?
2. There’s a good chance I see this barista again since there aren’t many good coffee options in this airport. If I see her again, do I just apologize and explain why I didn’t reach out? It isn’t like she did anything wrong, and I’d hate for someone’s feelings to be hurt after being brave enough to give her number to a customer.",0,1742493889.0,Advice,4,0.5,False

I started working again remotely 1wpo, eased myself from part time to full time by 2wpo. I was okay working remotely because generally I had freedom to take naps and make up any time I've missed and I worked from my bed, laying down.

I had to return to work this week and I am seriously struggling. It seems like sitting at my desk alone is wearing me out, but also, walking. The walk to the bathroom isn't long per se, but it can feel like it as it is. I average about 1-1.5 miles a day in walking since I've been back and it seems to be really wearing me out. I walked almost 2 miles yesterday after I had to run to the grocery store after work to grab something. 

Does that sound like possibly too much walking? I thought I had been easing myself into walking this much, as I had a few days last week where I walked 1-2 miles in a day. I currently ache very minimally at the end of the day, so I feel like I have no real indication that I am overdoing it?

And most of all, does anyone have tips so I am not constantly dozing at my desk? Coffee isn't doing much for me.

It went well, but it’s the last time.

I’ve never chatted with this guy before. He’s the representative of medicine program, so he was pretty activated on group chat to address the issues, mediate conflicts, negotiate with professors, etc. 

So one day, such idea just came to my mind. I dropped him a message to invite him to a cafe. (he’s pretty considerate that he wanted to go to one near my dorm.) 

At that day, I sit on the only available seat  in cafe beside a banana tree. Few minutes later, this middle eastern beard man shown up. We shook hands( yep hairy as usual) and I bought him a coffee. 

The atmosphere warmed up quickly since we got similar experiences. Then we talked the drawback of bureaucracy structures in academic systems and creeps we met at uni. Later we deep dived into more of the topics countries we lived for few years.

This nerdy innocent guy was giving off an asexual abstinence vibe. Neither up for or against any form of romantic relationships including homosexuality. It seems he also distanced from the chaos like drug, gossips, corruption and so on. Just purely engaged in study, students’ rights, TA and research. He also got the scholarship I applied for when I was 18.


The convo was pretty interesting . We basically had same complaints, struggles, joy, resonance, last but not the least, dreams. 

After the shopkeepers told us they’re closing, we moved to the hamburger shop then said goodbye. 

I suddenly felt that I’m not resent the hardship I gone through these years, but a sense of relief, understanding, and distant. 

I’ve long left that town by the time I’m writing this post. Although we will probably never meet again, I’m still grateful for the encounter—with such a cute guy, living on a parallel line, yet somehow, our paths still crossed.",1,1742493775.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Just as the title says, I'm trying to 3d model a cafe environment for an animation I'm working on. Thing is, I have no idea how cafes work outside of being a chill spot to be at, so I have a couple of questions from experienced modelers/anyone who would know.

  
\#1 What should I put in the actual cafe where the counter is? Like as in what a barista would work on tea and coffee, what kind of machines and equipment.

\#2 For the surrounding outside area, I only have grass and trees, it looks a little goofy so I wanted to add more to it to make it look a little more earthy.

  
These are some pictures of what I have so far, I'm open to advice and any kind of input. (Watermark to prevent stealing)

  
I am also open to general feedback in terms of how it looks and what I can do for general improvement. All is rendered in Cycles 4.4

It went well, but it’s the last time.

I’ve never chatted with this guy before. He’s the representative of medicine program, so he was pretty activated on group chat to address the issues, mediate conflicts, negotiate with professors, etc. 

So one day, such idea just came to my mind. I dropped him a message to invite him to a cafe. (he’s pretty considerate that he wanted to go to one near my dorm.) 

At that day, I sit on the only available seat  in cafe beside a banana tree. Few minutes later, this middle eastern beard man shown up. We shook hands( yep hairy as usual) and I bought him a coffee. 

The atmosphere warmed up quickly since we got similar experiences. Then we talked the drawback of bureaucracy structures in academic systems and creeps we met at uni. Later we deep dived into more of the topics countries we lived for few years.

This nerdy innocent guy was giving off an asexual abstinence vibe. Neither up for or against any form of romantic relationships including homosexuality. It seems he also distanced from the chaos like drug, gossips, corruption and so on. Just purely engaged in study, students’ rights, TA and research. He also got the scholarship I applied for when I was 18.


The convo was pretty interesting . We basically had same complaints, struggles, joy, resonance, last but not the least, dreams. 

After the shopkeepers told us they’re closing, we moved to the hamburger shop then said goodbye. 

I suddenly felt that I’m not resent the hardship I gone through these years, but a sense of relief, understanding, and distant. 

I’ve long left that town by the time I’m writing this post. Although we will probably never meet again, I’m still grateful for the encounter—with such a cute guy, living on a parallel line, yet somehow, our paths still crossed.",3,1742493641.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1jfv3hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealthTalk/comments/1jfv3hs/my_plexus_slim_pink_drink_review_firsthand/,"My Plexus Slim Pink Drink review: First-Hand Experience , Slim Microbiome activating 's comparison with other gut health drinks and supplements","**Rating: 3/5 stars**

**After several weeks of using Plexus Slim Pink Drink, my clients have found it to be a decent but nothing miraculous weight management & Gut health supplement (3/5 stars overall).**

**While it offers good gut health benefits through its XOS prebiotic fiber and provides convenient single-serve packets with a pleasant taste, its actual weight loss effects are modest at best.**

**The product is good for digestive improvement and convenience but falls short in value for money (at $80-90 monthly) and lacks robust independent scientific backing for its more dramatic claims about microbiome enhancement.**

**It causes minimal side effects and provides moderate appetite control, making it suitable as a complementary addition to a healthy lifestyle BUT NOT as a standalone solution for weight management.**

**For those seeking more effective alternatives, I'd recommend** [**LeanBiome**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/leanbiome.php) **for its targeted approach to fat-metabolizing bacterial strains along with green tea extract, with more consistent results, or** [**HourGlass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php) **(glucomannan fiber) for superior appetite suppression and metabolic support without the premium price tag of Plexus Slim. (Optional: combine with whey protein/cheap ""psyllium husk"" for stronger appetite suppression & weight loss results)**

**My Background with Gut Health/ Weight Loss Supplements**

As someone who has tried numerous of these supplements over the years, from fiber supplements to probiotics to thermogenics, I was curious to try the Plexus Slim Pink Drink that so many people have been talking about.

Besides, doing some coaching for my clients and helping them to lose weight, some of those have tried it, and I have taken insights from them.

So, here is my comprehensive review-

## What I Like

The Pink Drink has some definite positives that I notice:-

- **Taste is decent**: Unlike many drinks supplements that taste medicinal or artificial, this one is actually pleasant to drink. It has a mild berry flavor that isn't too sweet or overwhelming.
- **Convenience**: The individual packets make it easy to take on the go. Just mix with water and you're set.
- **Gut health improvements**: My clients did notice some positive changes in digestion after about a week of consistent use. Less bloating and more regular bowel movements, which is always a plus.
- **No jitters**: Unlike caffeine-heavy supplements you might have tried in the past, this won't give you the shakes or anxiety. The green coffee bean extract has minimal caffeine.

[You may also want to read my ColonBroom review. (a flavoured psyllium husk drink)(https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealthTalk/comments/1fgk922/my_comprehensive_colonbroom_review_is_this_the/)

## Where It Falls Short

Despite the positives, there were several drawbacks my clients have experienced:

- **Subtle weight loss effects**: If you're expecting dramatic weight loss results, you might be disappointed. Any changes I noticed were minimal at best, even with a consistent diet and exercise program.
- **Price point**: At roughly $80-90 for a month's supply, this is definitely on the pricier side compared to other gut health, micro-biota activating and probiotic supplements I've tried. You're paying a premium for the brand and marketing.
- **Takes time**: Don't expect immediate results. Any benefits I noticed took at least 2-3 weeks of consistent use to appear.
- **The science is limited**: While they claim clinical studies, the research specific to this exact formulation seems limited. Many of the benefits appear to be linked to individual ingredients rather than the product as a whole.

## My Honest Take

If you're looking for a magic pill (or in this case, a magic pink drink), this isn't it. However, if you understand that supplements can only complement a healthy lifestyle, not replace it, then Plexus Slim might be worth trying, if your budget allows it.

The **prebiotic fiber (XOS)** does seem to have some legitimate benefits for gut health, and chromium can help with blood sugar regulation. I found it most effective as a mid-afternoon drink that helped curb my snacking habits between lunch and dinner.

That said, I've had similar or better results with less expensive options, particularly high-quality probiotics combined with dietary fiber. The Pink Drink does consolidate multiple potential benefits into one product, which is convenient but comes at a cost.

## My Current Recommendations

After trying countless supplements, here are my current top recommendations that have consistently outperformed the overhyped Plexus Pink Drink:

**1) LeanBiome**

This is currently my top pick probiotic for weight loss. [LeanBiome](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/leanbiome.php) contains specifically selected bacterial strains that target fat metabolism much more effectively than Plexus, and I've experienced more consistent results with fewer digestive side effects. The targeted approach to microbiome health makes this my go-to recommendation for anyone serious about weight management through gut health optimization.

This probiotic formula also includes Green Coffee Bean Extract and Garcinia Cambogia, which may offer modest metabolism support and help with glucose metabolism.

**2) HourGlass Fit (Optional: combine with Whey Protein/Psyllium Husk Combo)**

My go-to strategy combines a [non-stimulant glucomannan fiber fat burner (HourGlass Fit)](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php) with whey protein and psyllium husk for the strongest appetite suppression and glucose regulation effects I've found. Although HourGlass Fit on its own is very effective at appetite suppression, weight loss and gut health too!

The combination provides immediate fullness that lasts for hours while supporting muscle maintenance, which the Pink Drink simply can't match. If you struggle with hunger control, this stack delivers results that Plexus can't come close to.

**3) Nagano Lean Body Tonic Drink**

[**This supergreens/probiotic supplement for weight loss**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/nagano.php) **and gut health** has become a staple in my routine. Unlike Plexus, Nagano provides a comprehensive blend of nutrients beyond just fiber and prebiotics - it delivers digestive enzymes, antioxidants, supergreens, and metabolism support in one formula. I've experienced better energy levels and more consistent digestive improvement than with the Pink Drink, and it mixes more smoothly with better flavor.

## Who Might Benefit with Plexus Slim Pink Drink

If you're someone who:

- Struggles with gut health issues
- Has trouble controlling between-meal snacking
- Is looking for a convenient supplement to complement your weight loss efforts
- Doesn't mind spending a bit more for a ready-to-mix product

Then Plexus Slim might be worth trying.

Based on my extensive experience with weight loss supplements, I've noticed that the market for probiotic-based weight management products can be segmented into five kinds of people.

Here's a breakdown of who might benefit most from Plexus Pink Drink and some alternatives to consider for each segment:

**1\. For Those seeking Gut Health Benefits**

If you are: Someone who struggles with digestive issues like bloating, irregular bowel movements, or general gut discomfort while trying to lose weight.

Why Plexus Pink Drink might work for you: The XOS prebiotic in Plexus specifically targets beneficial gut bacteria like Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium, which may help improve your overall digestive comfort while supporting weight management goals.

**Better alternatives to consider:**

[**LeanBiome**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/leanbiome.php)

Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic (higher-end, comprehensive gut health)

Culturelle Digestive Health Probiotic (more affordable, focused on digestive comfort)

Just Thrive Probiotic (spore-based for better survivability)

**2\. For those seeking Gentle Approach to weight loss & gut health management**

If you are: Someone who has had negative experiences with stimulant-based weight loss products and wants something milder.

Why Plexus Pink Drink might work for you: Unlike many thermogenic or caffeine-heavy weight loss supplements, Plexus contains minimal caffeine and focuses on supporting your body's natural processes rather than artificially stimulating metabolism.

**Better alternatives to consider:**

[HourGlass Fit (non-stimulant appetite control)](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php)

Garden of Life Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Weight Management

Natural Factors WellBetX Appetite Control (fiber-based)

**3\. The Blood Sugar Balancers**

If you are: Someone who experiences energy crashes, sugar cravings, or has concerns about blood glucose levels while trying to lose weight.

Why Plexus Pink Drink might work for you: The combination of chromium polynicotinate and green coffee bean extract in Plexus can help support healthy glucose metabolism, potentially reducing cravings and energy fluctuations.

**Alternatives to consider:**

[**PhenQ**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phenq8.php) **and** [**Blood Sugar Optimizer**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/bloodsugaroptimizer.php)

**Gundry MD Glucose Defense (targeted glucose support)**

Perfect Keto Blood Sugar Support Capsules (low-carb focused)

Berberine HCL supplements (research-backed for glucose metabolism)

**4\. The Convenience Seekers**

If you are: Someone who values simplicity and ease of use in your supplement routine, preferring an all-in-one solution over multiple products.

Why Plexus Pink Drink might work for you: The single-packet format that combines multiple ingredients (prebiotics, chromium, botanical extracts) means you don't need to take several different supplements throughout the day.

**Alternatives to consider:**

[**Nagano Lean Body Tonic**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/nagano.php)

Athletic Greens AG1 (comprehensive nutrition + probiotics)

Goli Complete Probiotics (gummy format for ease of use)

Orgain Organic Protein & Superfoods powder (nutrition + protein + fiber)

**5\. The Microbiome Optimizers**

If you are: Someone who understands the science connecting specific gut bacteria (microbiome) strains to weight management and metabolic health.

Why Plexus Pink Drink Microbiome activating might work for you: The targeted approach to increasing Akkermansia muciniphila (up to 250 times, according to their claims), which has been specifically linked to metabolic health in research studies.

**Alternatives to consider:**

LeanBiome (targeted strains specifically for weight management)

Pendulum Glucose Control (focuses on key metabolic strains)

Microbiome Plus Weight Management (targeted approach)

We all know that individual results vary greatly with probiotic-based weight loss supplements. Your unique gut microbiome, diet, lifestyle, and genetic factors all play important roles in how your body responds to these products.

## Bottom Line

Plexus Slim Pink Drink is neither miraculous nor useless – it falls somewhere in the middle. For me, it provided modest benefits that were noticeable but not life-changing. Your results may vary depending on your body chemistry and how it integrates with your overall health routine.

A probiotic supplement like this can’t really replace the fundamentals: a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate hydration, and proper sleep. If those basics are in place, Plexus Slim might give you a small additional boost – just keep your expectations realistic.

## My Final Plexus Slim Pink Drink Evaluation

Based on my first-hand experience and research with probiotic weight loss supplements, here's my honest evaluation of Plexus Slim Pink Drink across various performance categories (rated on a scale of 1-5):

**Effectiveness for Weight Loss: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)**

Plexus Slim provides modest weight management support but doesn't deliver dramatic results on its own. Most users (myself included) experience subtle changes that become noticeable after consistent use for several weeks. It works best as a complement to healthy eating and exercise rather than as a standalone solution.

**Gut Health Benefits: ★★★★☆ (4/5)**

The XOS prebiotic fiber effectively promotes beneficial gut bacteria growth, which I noticed through improved digestion and reduced bloating. Increasing Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium strains does create tangible digestive improvements for most users. This is probably the product's strongest feature, as the gut health benefits are more reliable than the weight loss effects.

**Appetite Control: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)**

The Pink Drink provides moderate appetite suppression, mainly through its fiber content and potentially through blood sugar regulation. I found it somewhat helpful for reducing mid-afternoon snack cravings when consumed about 30 minutes before typical hunger strikes. However, the effect isn't strong enough to overcome significant hunger or emotional eating patterns.

**Taste & Drinkability: ★★★★☆ (4/5)**

The berry flavor is pleasant without being overly sweet or artificial-tasting like many supplements. It mixes reasonably well with water, though sometimes requires extra stirring to fully dissolve. The fact that it's enjoyable to drink increases the likelihood of consistent use, which is essential for seeing any results.

**Value for Money: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)**

At approximately $80-90 for a 30-day supply, Plexus Slim is quite expensive compared to other probiotic and prebiotic supplements with similar ingredients. The convenience factor of the single-serve packets adds value, but you're paying a premium for the brand name and marketing. I've found less expensive alternatives that deliver similar or better results.

**Ingredient Quality: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)**

The formula contains some science-backed ingredients like chromium and prebiotic fiber, but proprietary blends make it difficult to assess exact amounts of active components. While the ingredients are generally recognized as safe, the ""Plexus Slim Blend"" lacks transparency about exact quantities of each component. Green coffee bean extract and garcinia cambogia have mixed evidence for effectiveness.

**Convenience: ★★★★★ (5/5)**

The individual packets are extremely convenient for on-the-go use and travel. Simply tear open, pour into water, stir, and drink – no measuring or mess involved. This convenience factor is perhaps the product's strongest selling point, as it removes barriers to consistent supplement use.

**Side Effects (lack of): ★★★★☆ (4/5)**

Most users (including myself) experience minimal side effects beyond potential mild digestive adjustment in the first few days. Unlike stimulant-heavy weight loss supplements, there are no jitters, sleep disturbances, or heart palpitations. Some sensitive individuals might experience mild gas or bloating initially as the gut microbiome adjusts.

**Scientific Support: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)**

While individual ingredients have some research backing, studies specifically on the complete Plexus Slim formula are limited and often company-sponsored. The prebiotic fiber benefits are well-established in scientific literature, but claims about dramatic microbiome changes and weight loss effects are less thoroughly validated by independent research.

**Overall Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)**

Plexus Slim is a decent product that delivers moderate benefits, particularly for gut health, but falls short of its marketing claims for significant weight loss. For best results, view it as a helpful supplement to a comprehensive weight management plan rather than a miracle solution. There are both more effective and more affordable options available depending on your specific goals.",1,1742493504.0,GutHealthTalk,0,1.0,False
1jfv3bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jfv3bj/my_best_friend_ghosted_me_after_15_years_and_i/,"My Best Friend Ghosted Me After 15 Years, and I Just Found Out Why","
So, I (30M) had a best friend, let’s call him Jake (30M), and we were inseparable since middle school. We went through everything together—family struggles, breakups, dumb teenage drama, all of it. Even as life pulled us in different directions (different colleges, different jobs), we always made time for each other.

Then, about a year ago, he just… disappeared. No fight, no slow fade, just completely ghosted me. At first, I thought he was just busy, but after weeks of unanswered texts and ignored calls, I realized something was wrong. I even reached out to his family, who just said, “He’s going through some things.”

I was pissed, confused, and hurt. I replayed every conversation we had, wondering if I had unknowingly said or done something to push him away. Eventually, I just had to move on.

Fast forward to last week. I ran into a mutual friend who mentioned that Jake had moved back into town. I debated whether I should reach out, but before I could, he texted me—after a year of radio silence.

We met up for coffee, and he looked rough. He immediately apologized and told me he had been battling depression—severe enough that he shut out almost everyone, including his own family. He didn’t want to “burden” me and thought disappearing was the best way to handle it.

Then he dropped a bomb: his dad, who had always been a tough, distant guy, had passed away suddenly. Jake had spent his whole life trying to earn his dad’s approval, and when he died, it broke him. He spiraled into a deep depression, convinced he wasn’t “good enough” for anyone, including me.

Hearing all this hit me hard. I was angry at him for ghosting me, but I also felt guilty for not realizing just how bad things were. I told him he never had to go through that alone, and we just sat there in silence for a while, processing everything.

I don’t know if things will ever be the same between us, but I do know one thing: check on your friends, even the ones who seem the strongest.

1jfv30a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SammyIngramLOA/comments/1jfv30a/starting_to_doubt_sammys_teachings/,Starting to Doubt Sammy’s Teachings,"Sammy teaches that the way you manifest is by thinking as if you already have what you want, regardless of what the 3D reality is showing you. However, there are some things in my reality that just won’t manifest, no matter how much I think as if I have them. I’ve tried to manifest living in a new mansion since November 2023, still no luck. I’ve tried to manifest big lottery wins, no luck. I tried to manifest meeting my favorite celebrity for 6 months, no luck.

And it’s not just me, I NEVER hear success stories of anyone manifesting big things, such as lottery wins, moving into mansions, or dating celebrities. The only success stories I see are people getting text messages from their SPs, getting free cups of coffee, getting small amounts of money, finding items they lost, etc. If what Sammy teaches is true, that you can have absolutely anything you want simply just by thinking as if you have it already, then why are so few people (if anyone at all) successfully manifesting luxurious lifestyles?

I also find it strange how every manifestation coach teaching the same things Sammy teaches doesn’t make any vlogs showing their life in action, all they do is sit in front of the camera and teach you how to manifest (and maybe share success stories), but don’t show it in action. For example, why don’t they film themselves going to a concert and manifesting getting to meet the performer(s) backstage? Or, why don’t they film themselves going to a casino and manifesting winning $1,000 on a slot machine?

Also, 99% of people posting manifestation content try hard to sell you coaching, books, or masterclasses. Sure, there’s nothing wrong with teaching people how to manifest, but how come nobody does it for free? If they know manifestation so well, they should have an infinite number of ways to make money without begging people to buy their stuff.

The 1% of coaches who don’t try to sell you anything (such as “Neville Goddess” on YouTube and Reddit) don’t teach manifestation the same way Sammy does. They’ll teach that manifestation is not spiritual magic or controlling reality with your thoughts, it’s just changing your perspective and convincing yourself that you can do the hard things required to get what you want (for example, manifesting good grades = convincing yourself that you can study and do the hard assignments required to get those grades). Or, they might teach that manifestation is just listening to your intuition at all times, which leads to you getting everything that makes you happy, even if it’s not exactly what you expected.

Lastly, I saw a post on here from someone claiming to know Sammy personally saying that Sammy frequently lies, buys comments and subscribers, and writes fake success stories. Some people (including Sammy herself) say that post is just a troll post, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it is legit.

Overall, this all just seems fishy. What are your thoughts?",1,1742493472.0,SammyIngramLOA,2,1.0,False

1jfv28t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jfv28t/aitah_because_i_brought_my_boyfriend_to_pick_up/,AITAH because I brought my boyfriend to pick up my son?,"I have no family or close friends to ask, so here we go Reddit. 

Context:

I was in a relationship for four years with my ex/bd (we met online on an app called Yubo). I fell out of love and broke up with him August of 2024 (my son was six months old then) due to repetitive actions and actions done while I was induced. I will include more if needed. Throughout this time I did remain loyal to the relationship.

I met my current boyfriend in June of ‘24 where we worked. He was my new departments trainer/learning ambassador. We made it official in late September. 

During the time before, I made it clear that I have a son and was currently in a relationship and showed him pictures of the three of us. He respected the boundary and didn’t pursue and kept each other at an arms distance. 

Another note: bd and I are currently in court custody. His mother (son’s grandmother) put in a petition and they all live together. Apparently this was a mistake and it shouldn’t have gone through, but it did. I have visitation and we both have joint.

Last note: my son (now one year old) *tends to take a liking more towards women* (edited due to poor wording, I do apologize) and loves smiling and giggling with any woman looking in his direction. He can definitely care less about any guy. Though, when my bf and son met it was an instant connection. I was speechless. 

I have never been so appreciative of my bf. He’s absolutely amazing and has helped us so much in the short amount of time we’ve been together (today marks 6 months). I do trust him with everything I have and have met just about his entire family and they love having me over for any family gathering. My son has only met his dad (we live with him until we get an apartment and has graciously let my son stay over during my days), and his mom.

Now, there are clear and obvious boundaries set in place:
My bf is not to change my son.
My bf is his friend, not “new dad”.
I always have to be within the vicinity if they’re alone (door always open, basically).

Now, to today. Today was a home visit with our awesome case worker. All visits have been at bd mom’s house. We have to use my bf car because mine is out of commission (needs a new engine, engine mount, clutch, and battery just to start it up). I have brought him over before and had backed into the driveway. Bd mom said no more, bf is not allowed on her property. We said okay and I parked on the street last couple times. Home visit was quick, no more than 10 minutes. 

Bd and I stepped out to talk because I initially asked for Thursday morning-Saturday morning. There’s an event that’s up north (2 hours away) and bf and I are getting up at 4am and are going to be out all day so I asked to shorten until Friday night. In the process, my bf had gotten out the passenger side and to the driver to start up the car for me. Bf said a polite hello; bd can also care less about bf and pleasantries. Bd mom also saw bf.

We wrapped up our conversation and on the way to grab bf a coffee I got a call from bd saying his mom said no more bf over at her house. I told him I parked on the street for this reason. Bd mom does have “No Trespassing” signs on her house, but not for him specifically (but I have a good guess he’s on the list now), and he had to make a couple stops while we’re already out. Coffee, Walmart for car stuff, Whole Foods for my bf boujee self, then home. 

After my comment, bd told me I wasn’t seeing the whole picture and I was disrespecting him by bringing bf over and asked to be put on speakerphone (I refused) so he could basically threaten my bf saying he was going to pull something if he came over again. I was livid he was being this aggressive told him absolutely not and that I’ll do whatever or call whoever is needed to keep this situation from being violent. He stood by his words and the call ended.

Obviously, I told bf what was said. His main point was him protecting his peace and would, unfortunately, end things if it got to that point and doesn’t want a hit on his back. I completely understood because in this situation he does have to put himself first. It’s one of the things I love him for.

This is my first time ever in a situation like this and I have no one close to seek advice or guidance from.

I had a really good day today going for coffee with friends and felt beautiful. Wp just in from work today and talks about my day, his day, school blah blah.

He’s 61, loves his morning coffee with extra sugar, and refuses to give up his favorite foods. But last year, he started noticing weird blood sugar spikes—he’d feel shaky and tired after meals, and by the afternoon, he’d crash hard.

By November, his doctor told him his levels were creeping up, and if he didn’t make some changes, he might have to go on medication. That kind of freaked him out, but he also wasn’t thrilled about giving up the foods he loved.

That’s when he started looking into natural ways to support blood sugar—and somehow, he found something called GlycoFortin. At first, he was skeptical (he’s the kind of guy who calls anything “a gimmick”), but he figured it was worth a shot.

[GlycoFortin Reviews](https://preview.redd.it/2lg03aatuvpe1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf41032be3fc3d3f3cbe5a3be3913d8112389d80)

By January, he told me he was actually feeling better after meals—no more crazy energy crashes. His afternoon slumps disappeared, and he wasn’t constantly craving sweets anymore. When he checked his levels, they were more stable than before. He still enjoys his favorite foods (in moderation), but he doesn’t feel like he’s walking a tightrope anymore.

Honestly, I was just relieved to see him taking control of his health without feeling miserable. It made me wonder how many people struggle with this but assume they just have to deal with it.

Has anyone else found natural ways to manage blood sugar? I feel like most advice out there is just “cut carbs and exercise,” but I know that’s not always realistic for everyone.

I matched each LI with a perfume that captures their personality, vibe, and overall aura - and let's just say, Caleb’s scent definitely involves apples.

But these are just my takes! I'd love to hear your thoughts too - did I nail their vibes, or do you picture them differently? Drop your own perfume ideas or scent headcanons in the comments!

Ladies and Gentleman- I've done it!

Nononono...wait...hold on a second...

**THANK YOU GUYS!**

Thanks for all of your warm, encouraging, comforting words! Did I remember them when I was sitting in the dentist chair? Nope...sorry...to much adrenaline! And to much noises and me, being to scared!

But they helped in the night before, on the morning, even an hour before and on my way to the chair!

Thank you!

**But now!**

It's done! 

I do have my smile back!

I 

do 

have 

my

smile 

back!

Gosh, I am drooling like a german shepard dog, I'm lisping, I'm getting used to the two weird things in my mouth and I'm slurping carefully my coffee and my chicken stock and I'm tearing up but I can smile!

After 15 years I can smile again!

It doesn't feel normal yet, my muscle memory ist till trying to hide everything but there is no need for anymore! And I'm so indescribable happy and grateful for it.

**How did it worked out yesterday?**

The appointment was set for 13:20.

I got out of bed at 8ish, had a cup of coffee, some breakfast (knowing the you're eating maybe the last time for some days a piece of bread feels....weird!?) and then I did some distracting things...gaming, listening to comforting music,  kind of meditative breathing, a nice hot shower, wearing comfy but nice clothes and my Doc.Martens as kind of armour, brushed my teeth a last time (Silly or? Its like cleaning the house half an hour before the cleaning lady take care for everything or washing hair before going to the barber!) and then my girlfriend and me left the house, went to the train station...At some point my brain turned on the ""protection mode"".

""Keep on breathing , give up control to your girlfriend...it's going to be alright!""

  
We arrived at the clinic around 13:10 and these last 10,15 minutes of waiting were difficult!

Body says ""Run! Escape"", Brain says ""Stay!You'll be fine!!""...

And then I was picked up and led to the room, the chair, the smell, the instruments, the needle...

In all fairness and in all honesty, getting through the procedure of receiving the local anesthesia was the most painful bit!

I spare you the details of sounds and stuff...it wasn't nice! Absolutely not but it wasn't as bad as I was afraid of!

Anesthesia and adrenalin are amazing and evil at the same time!

I could feel some pressure in my jaws and two times a bit of pain but compared to what I have suffered from...it was absolutely manageable!

My breathing might have sounded very hectic, quick, afraid but it helped to breathe (how do you call it in English....)aware?

I had an amazing nurse who checked on me every few minutes and my surgeon told me every single step he did! Thankfully! Not knowing what's going on and feeling helpless is not nice....

  
When I was finished, when my protheses were placed in my mouth all I could taste was blood and the menthol taste of the disinfect.

I was shaky, shivery as hell because of the adrenalin but....happy...

I had to sit down for a few minutes in the waiting room to recover and to calm down...

Pain? No! not at all! I couldn't talk! Yes, I used the notes app on my mobile phone to communicate with my girlfriend, but absolutely no pain!

And then the first look in the mirror...with numb lips and a numb piece of meat, called tongue, in my mouth....and teeth!

Human dignity is inviolable...but fragile...and since yesterday, I've got back my smile, my happy personality, my dignity!

Believe me, I danced in front of my mirror! Smiling!!! Crying, just little bit, manly, but  I watched myself in the mirror with an open mouth!

Eating and drinking was difficult! GF made an amazing olive soup for dinner! To swallow wasn't easy..but taste wise everything is absolutely fine! Everything tastes even more intense!

At around 22:00 I went to bed and I fall asleep about 22:02?

**Today**

I don't have much pain, actually I'm almost  free for pain! Paracetamol and ibuprofen are amazing!

But my energy level is very low! 

Today,I'm a couch potato! And that's fine!

I've been to my dentist for a quick check up and everything is fine!

I've got a weird bloody taste in my mouth and when I rinse the upper protheses, it smells...funky...but that's, according to my dentist, absolutely ok! It's a wound, blood, healing process, bakteria, but everything is fine!

Talking on the other hand is....different...that I need to practise!

My mouth is producing a lot of spittle, more than usual but its just a question of time till it gets less again!

  
I've been to town, doing groceries.

And being able to smile because of the nice weather, the smell of spring and because I can smile again

is pure life quality.

  
It's not perfect yet, it needs time and practise, in a few weeks my dentures will need some adjustment and fine tuning but I don't need to be afraid of my dentist!

She helped me, she didn't judged, she didn't asked about the why's, she just helped!

She watched me tearing up because of happiness and gratitude!

She'll help me in the future!

  
Human dignity is inviolable! She gave me my dignity back!





I'll add an picture when my lips learned how to smile again!

Right now...It looks funny but creepy but funny...

Like when I was child and  my parents told me to smile for the photographer at school...

And you guys know and understand why...



  
Thank you for...listening, reading, smiling, maybe even tearing up....

But you guys know how It feels to live without smiling.

Not everyone knows yet how it feels when you got your smile back- but I, no, we are going to be there for you! Maybe we can't answer all of your questions but we can give you one big thing!

  
The knowledge that you're not alone!

My favorite was Black & White Wilton Benitez Pink Bourbon. Wild flavors - very fruity but also ""galaxy hop"" flavor note was quite complementary. Reminded me of a galaxy hop co-ferment coffee I tasted in the past, but with more balanced flavors and sweetness.

Black and White Jhonatan Gasca Pacamara was the most interesting. All the tasting notes were clear, and cherry was strong. Made me think of cherry filled chocolate truffles. As an aside, this coffee was used in blend for [Jake McFarland](https://youtu.be/5m0dI3jibqw?si=v71hs6e7Q7TDXL10) of Black & White in the US Barista Championship.

Thanks u/dirtydials & Rotation for opportunity to taste side-by-side. I otherwise wouldn't have placed the minimum order of 540g and $60 to purchase these 3 bags from Black & White.

I have OCD in impurity. I have fears of filthy things such as feces and urine.  
Today, a situation has happened to me which is making anxious and overthinking.

I went to a small computer store to replace my power supply unit for my PC. the employer inspected my pc, then he dusted it with air compressor because it had a lot of dust.

my problem here is that he put the pc in the floor (Both vertically and horizontally) while he has dusting it off. I am having doubts and fears whether the floor is clean or not. The floor was dry and had some spots that look like coffee spots and dust spots. the floor looks clean enough but im heaving fears of its cleanliness, especially the fact that this floor gets step on by shoes.

also, I'm having doubts whether the shoes of the employer touched my pc or not while he was dusting it off. probably not, and even if it did, it's most likely the sideways (front.back,left,right) of the shoes that may have touched the PC. most likely not the bottom of the shoes.

all that said, I'm debating if I should clean the PC or I should not listen to the OCD.

What I'm asking for you to help me with is, would you worry about this situation? would you even think of it? do you think it was totally normal for the employer to put my pc in the ground?

No one built it. No one owns it. It has always been there.

There is a clearing with fire pits that never seem to cool, picnic tables that show no signs of rot, and cabins that should be abandoned—but aren’t.

They are simple structures. Wooden, one-room, with cots lined against the walls. The doors have locks, but the keys are missing. The windows latch from the inside.

Visitors come and go. Hikers, travelers, people just passing through. The cabins are free to use, and yet… they are never all empty at the same time.

Even when no one is staying in them, signs of occupancy remain.

A steaming cup of coffee on the table.

A book left open to the middle of a page.

A radio playing a station that does not exist.

The trails leading to the campsite twist and shift. No one takes the same path in twice.

You always arrive when the sun is setting.

The sky is the wrong color when you get there—deeper than twilight, not quite night. The trees stretch high, taller than they should be, their branches arching together like ribs.

At night, the fire pits burn low, casting flickering shadows that move strangely against the cabins.

There are noises in the woods. They do not sound like animals.

Some say they hear laughter. Others, whispering.

And if you wake up in the middle of the night, staring at the cabin door, unsure of what startled you—

Don’t open it.

For context, I am a Cebuana who moved here because I fell in love with a Batangueño. I lived in Manila when we met and when our relationship progressed (he proposed), I agreed to settle down with him in Lipa. Last year, I had to go back to Cebu because two of my family members got cancer and eventually died. We were in a LDR for roughly 5 months. I came back in December 2024 and we moved in to our new house. Then January of this year, I found out he cheated on me while I was away. I couldn't fathom the betrayal so I ended our relationship. I left our house the following day while he was at work and rented a condo here. Told him we should sell the house asap and split the amount since we both financed it. We also own a business here which I own the majority of it. Those two are the reasons why I can't just leave Lipa. As soon as we reach an amicable settlement for the house and the business, I would leave. But for now, I'm stuck here. 

The only peope I know in Lipa are his family and friends. I want to meet new people and find genuine friendships too. I'm always at coffee shops just to read and pass the time. I also tried drinking at a bar alone — some people tried to talk to me but it's not something I'm really into. Idk where to start actually. It's really sad because I am very talkative and fun to talk to but lately I find myself so quiet. Idk where to start actually. It's not like I can just bump at people here and all of a sudden we become bestfriends. The only actual conversations I get to have is from the tinderas and guards.

Maybe I got desperate when I set to go on a meet and greet with this woman at a nice restaurant. Maybe I should have went for drinks or coffee instead. But I tried to start things on a good foot but it was just awful. She was what I thought initially more engaging then the rest, with the rest of the women being low energy, disinterested, exhausting in attempting to have a conversation with so maybe because of these previous issues I overlooked something.

We met up at a restaurant which is one is difficult to get a reservation for due to it being one the most popular restaurants in Chicago, requiring me to setup a bot to automatically grab a reservation. I showed up and we nearly lost the reservation because she was late, when I tried to talk to her about what she said her interests were she just gave non-answer responses, often times requiring me to repeat myself because she wasn't even bothering to listen to me.

She wasn't going through anything, like she was spacing out, she was just bored, disinterested in being there in the first place, scrolling through her phone. The only real time she engaged with me was to repeatedly ask for money for various things.

1jfulwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1jfulwg/i_have_turned_into_a_real_couch_cushion_after/,I have turned into a real couch cushion after parenting.,"My wife and I have been married for five years next week. We have a three year old girl, a one year old girl, and she's 7 months pregnant with (finally) a boy. 

I used to go to the gym 4-5 days a week, take my 16 pills a day of vitamins, supplements, fish oils, etc. Only drink water and coffee. You get the point. 

Ever since the arrival of the second child I have been doing everything I can to be a more present father. I found a hybrid job, I say no to a LOT of things that would take time away from my kids, I got sober (almost 90 days now) and the reason for my post - I quit my gym membership and spent $3k on a home gym to put in my garage that I have worked out on for maybe 10 days total and I bought it six months ago. I've stopped all protein and supplementation and I feel myself REALLY getting out of shape. 

Used to when I had a gym membership, I would wake up at 4 am and get to the gym at 5 when it opened. Started my day off really well. When I built the garage gym, I told myself I'd workout at night after the kids go to bed around 8 pm. Now I do neither and I don't know how to get out of this cycle. I have a PT test coming up in 3 weeks (military) that I'm super worried about because I can barely do 40 pushups when I used to be able to do 70 in a minute. 

At night when the kids go to bed, I'm so drained I can't even fathom another 2 hours of working out, showering, getting in bed, and *then* decompressing. And I can't do it in the morning before work because I don't want to make too much noise with showering afterwards because my toddler usually ends up in our bed at night and both kids are near the two bathrooms in our house. I love working out and being healthy and I want to be for my kids but am I just being lazy? I was doing fine with 1 kid, but the second one has taken me and my wife all the way out and we have another on the way. Is it just a phase? I feel like I'm going insane sometimes. lol.

1jfuibk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jfuibk,(Invasion of) the Body Snatchers connections/allusions,"
After someone on Reddit mentioned that “Santa Mira” was the fictional town in “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” I decided to dig up a copy of the book I bought back in college, but never read.  It’s been a while since I watched the 1956 film, but the 1978 film is a favorite.

So far I’m only halfway done with the book, but a pair of passages caught my attention (see photos).  The first has to do with the technology of rotary phones “refining all the humanity out of our lives,” and the second has to do with (mostly) wholesome benefits of having a “duplicate.”

One more from the page opposite the discussion of “duplicates.”

Each one is a synonym for the “Four Tempers”

Woe = Grief

Frolic = Happiness

Dread = Fear

Malice = Horror

Maybe “Contentment” is the goal of balancing the Four Tempers?

I’m only half way through, so there may be more to come.  Just wanted to get this in before the finale to feel clever ;)

Taylor Holloway, left, and Thomas Craley pose for a photo at Wick-ed Palette Studio in Toledo on Sunday.
Two creatives are mixing it up in downtown Toledo in a 2,450-square-foot space that exudes inspiration.

Six others are joining them, offering classes from candle making to tie dye to public speaking and acting. Even a culinary kitchen is in the works.

“It was not enough to make something and sell it, but to teach others as well,” said Taylor Holloway who, with her business partner, Thomas Craley, will be hosting the grand opening of Wick-ed Palette Studio from 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday at the Davis Building, 151 N. Michigan Ave.

The studio’s offerings will include, a candle making class with Holloway; Acrylic painting with TC Acrylics, by Thomas Craley; Introduction to crochet, by Ariel Kay Markus; Paper flowers by the Paper Garden, by Mary Willets; Public speaking/​acting with K.J. Khaleb Coleman; Cutting and polishing stones with Medusas Stones LLC, by Sarah Nidek-Eberle; Tie dye with Sklar Don VanValenburg; and Tie dye with Michelle Fisher.

In fact, the partnership Craley and Holloway have founded was inspired when they walked across the soon-to-be studio floor. There are four stations, plus the future kitchen, where creatives can teach as many as 20 people in each station. The space, with a couch and even a small lending library, is ready to spark a wave of innovation.

“The most important thing is to have the space to be creative,” Holloway said. “If it is too tight, it pulls the air out of the room.”

The physical space, located just west of the Pythian Castle, is in fact a historic one.

It dates to 1901, when it was constructed by Charles Ashley, and until a redesign in 1952 made way for office space, the building was known for its two story auditorium, concerts, and music classes.

The partners are interested in furthering that creative spirit in the block, which currently houses zero waste store Just Toledo, WS Design Kitchen and Bath Studio, Belle Amour Bridal, and Salon Onyx.

Craley’s business, TC Acrylics, was born during the pandemic.

“I started doing it, and people started buying it. I didn’t know what was going on,” he said — almost smiling.

The studio hopes to even be part of the bigger picture, according to Craley, 40, who noted the downtown is host to numerous murals and events sponsored by such organizations as the Arts Commission.

“Toledo’s creative community is one of the best. There are a hundred little galleries in Toledo that people don’t even know exist,” he said.

For Holloway, 32, starting a business is nothing new.

“I am a serial entrepreneur. I started a cleaning business at age 16,” said Holloway, noting that her most popular projects are terrarium candles and candles that look like coffee cups.

Holloway announced in January that her business Callisto Terra, which held candle-making workshops, was closing its former storefront at 5223 Hill Ave. and rebranding as Callisto On the Go, with mobile candle making for hire in private spaces as well as other locations like Copper Moon Studio and CK Sweets. Most Callisto offerings will move to Wick-ed after this weekend.

It is through arts and crafts fairs and markets that Holloway and Craley became friends — and it is from that community that a favorable response to their endeavor has arisen.

“I have been friends with them for years. We come from the same world,” said Michelle Fisher, who will be hosting a do-it-yourself station for tie-dye projects, including socks, bandanas, and shirts, at the grand opening.

In addition to appearances from makers like Fisher, snacks, drinks, freebies, and signups for upcoming classes will be available on Sunday.

Fisher, of Sylvania, discovered her penchant for tie dye during the pandemic lockdown, when she ordered a kit.

“When COVID hit, we all picked up hobbies,” she said. “I put it online, and people liked it. I decided to keep doing it.”

Fisher, 37, also has seen entrepreneurs expanding their creativity throughout northwest Ohio.

“It is fun watching it and being part of it,” she said.

Fisher says she is looking forward to conducting workshops in the new studio space, and Holloway and Craley say the response to their venture has them looking forward to success.

“People are willing to partner with us. They see the value in it,” Craley said. “We haven’t even hit our potential.”

Holloway says their path has been “aligned and divine.”

“It is a big art community. They are very supportive,” she said.

1jfuh6m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jfuh6m,E.P. Carrillo New Wave Connecticut Stellas Review – A Smooth & Flavorful Connecticut Experience,"Known for pushing the boundaries of traditional Connecticut cigars, Ernesto Perez-Carrillo crafted this blend to offer more depth and character than the typical mild Connecticut smoke. Featuring an Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper over Nicaraguan and Dominican long-fillers, the New Wave Connecticut delivers a silky-smooth yet flavorful experience that caters to both beginners and seasoned smokers alike.

On a sunny afternoon, a beer in hand, I decided to light one up and see if this modern Connecticut lived up to the hype.


Presentation & Cold Draw

The New Wave Connecticut Stellas is a beautifully rolled cigar, with a silky, golden-brown wrapper that’s nearly flawless. The seams were tight, the veins were minimal, and the construction felt firm yet slightly springy to the touch.

On the cold draw, I picked up sweet cream, cedar, and a hint of honey, with a faint touch of white pepper and  faint vanilla flavour in the background. The draw was effortless, setting the stage for a smooth, easygoing smoke.


First Third – Creamy & Approachable

The cigar lit up perfectly, immediately producing plentiful, creamy smoke. The first puffs were silky and smooth, with sweet cedar, buttered toast, and roasted almonds leading the way.

A mild white pepper spice was present on the retrohale, but it was subtle—just enough to keep things interesting. As the burn progressed, a touch of honey sweetness appeared, balancing out the creamy core. The burn line was razor-sharp, and the ash held firm, reflecting E.P. Carrillo’s renowned craftsmanship.


Second Third – Smooth Complexity

Moving into the second third, the flavors became more layered. The cedar and toastiness remained, but now notes of light caramel, vanilla, and baking spices started to emerge. The peppery kick softened, allowing a buttery smooth texture to take center stage.

At this point, the cigar settled into a perfectly balanced medium body, still mild enough for newer smokers but with enough complexity to keep veterans engaged. The burn remained perfect, requiring no touch-ups.


Final Third – A Satisfying, Elegant Finish

As the final third began, the creaminess evolved into a toasted nut and light leather profile, while the honey sweetness faded into a more subtle nougat-like flavor. The cigar never lost its smoothness, and the pepper on the retrohale remained minimal but present.

The cedar and spice notes became slightly more pronounced toward the end, giving the cigar a refined yet satisfying finish. It remained balanced and enjoyable down to the nub.


Final Thoughts

The E.P. Carrillo New Wave Connecticut Stellas is a fantastic modern Connecticut that delivers silky smooth flavors with just enough complexity to keep things interesting. It’s an ideal morning smoke, pairing beautifully with coffee or tea, but also works as a midday or early evening option for those looking for a relaxing, creamy cigar.

With a smoke time of around 45 minutes, it’s a great short smoke for those who want refinement without heaviness. Would I smoke it again? Without question. This a great Connecticut-wrapped cigars for those who appreciate flavor, balance, and expert construction.",2,1742491989.0,cigar,0,1.0,False

Now I am overwhelmed and don't even know how to tell my supervisors. I don't know if the corrigendum will affect the impact of the paper, and part of me just wants to leave it aside.

1jfughq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jfughq/aitah_i_was_talking_to_this_woman_on_bumble/,AITAH? I was talking to this woman on Bumble,"So I’m 35, been in and out of a lot of relationships at this point. Some of them last a few months, some last a few years. I’m coming out of a five month, very one sided relationship, and decided, “I’m going to live my life like this never happened.” So I sign up for these dating apps - Bumble, Tinder, FB Dating, Match, Hinge, whatever.

The idea is that I’ll just date around - like actual dating. You know, get lunch or a coffee date, walk the beach, go bowling or see a movie thing. Meet some people, build up some time and experiences with them, and if we like one another, maybe something more. I’d rather do it this way, because diving head first into relationships (situationships) with the women I’ve been with has not been very good for me, clearly. I’m 35, never married, and no children (not from a lack of trying).

So I match with this lady, we talk for awhile and it’s more than just small talk. We’re exchanging actual conversation. The subject is brought up on what we’re looking at on the dating apps and I told her the truth.

I generally don’t read the bio. I’ve learned that people can just say whatever they want on the internet and be a completely different person in public and behind closed doors. I told her that I look at how the woman is dressed in their pictures. What kind of activities that they’re doing. Filters, if they’re genuinely smiling and things like that. From there, I can make a lot of simple deductions. If most of their pictures are of them partying, that’s not someone I want to be with. That tells me they party a lot, for example.

Now remember, I’m 35. Blink a few times and I’ll be 40 in 2030. Knowing lifestyles is kind of important at this age. Most people at my age have already been married once, have kids, and such. I haven’t. I believe marriage is not just a big fun party that you can walk away from, and I always believed that if I was to have a child, that it should be with a woman that I can trust for the rest of my life. With that in mind -

I tell her that I also look for full body pictures. I tell her that I’m sorry if that sounds bad or misogynistic, but a potential partner’s health is fairly important to me. I’m dating between 28 and 40 year old women. If they’re on the heavy side of life, then it’s probably a good indicator that they’re not wanting to live a healthy weight, and that’s important to me. I’m a fairly active man. I do go hiking. I live 10 minutes from the beach and walk the beach often. I go fishing, walk my dog often, and other physical activities. I do a LOT more than just watch sports and play video games. If a woman is approaching 40 and she’s heavy, she probably has commitment or motivational issues. Maybe she’s insecure or just stress eats.

Either way, the lady stopped talking to me immediately. Didn’t end the chat or anything, but just stopped talking to me. 

So now I have to ask, am I an asshole for having standards?

And before I post this, I want to make a side note -

I’ve dated a fair amount of women in my life. Most of them were either on the thinner or healthier side, some of them were a bit more well rounded or curvy. I don’t mean hook ups, I mean like legitimately dating. I’ve dated all kinds of women, from “all natural” bartenders, to rich cheerleaders, to broke waitresses. I’ve been in relationships with marathon runners and gym rats, to bougie women looking for the next yacht party and brunch date. I’ve been with women that grew up riding horses to women that just want to read a good book with a cup of tea.

I’m not perfect. I know I’m not perfect. I’m not exactly ugly or handsome, I’m 5’10” and middle class, I’m athletic but I’m also on the thinner side (but great blood pressure and cholesterol levels). Most relationships I’ve been in, we just didn’t work. Sometimes it was my fault. Sometimes it was our fault. Sometimes it was their fault. A lot of the women that I’ve dated seemed interested in other things that generally wouldn’t work out in the future for them, and message me later. I usually say “no thanks.”

So I’m at that point in my life where I’m not “attacking women,” I’m just being choosy now. As I’ve said, most women my age already have kids, have been divorced, and generally don’t seem interested in anyone unless they meet “certain” criteria’s, so when I decide I want to be with someone that can keep up with me, I can feel comfortable. 

Am I the asshole here?",0,1742491937.0,AITAH,12,0.5,False

Born and raised in Canada but fueled by my Italian roots, I’m basically a walking mix of maple syrup and espresso. I talk with my hands, get way too passionate about food (carbonara over everything), and believe that life’s too short for bad coffee.

I’m always up for an adventure, whether it’s finding the best pizza in town, getting overly competitive in a board game, or dancing in the kitchen like nobody’s watching. My energy? Unmatched. My laugh? Loud and contagious. And yes, I will absolutely argue with you about whether poutine or pasta is the superior comfort food (spoiler: it’s pasta).

If you’re looking for someone who can switch between Italian spice and Canadian chill in a heartbeat—congrats, you’ve found me. 🍝✨",1,1742491876.0,treesandpeace,0,1.0,False
1jfufgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1jfufgv/nothing_i_take_works_for_my_yeast_infections/,Nothing I take works for my yeast infections. What's next?,"I constantly have a yeast infection going. There's an overgrowth of candida albicans that's been a problem since high school (I'm now 31). It's definitely Candida A. because I've been positive for it multiple times in the past, but apart from discharge I have no symptoms (as far as I know).

I've tried clotrimazole, nystatin, miconazole, boric acid, probiotics and coconut oil. None of them them worked, and all of the medicinal treatments burned terribly. Boric acid was the worst of all, I only had it in me for twenty minutes before it began to feel like someone was stabbing me in the cervix. I have endometriosis- this was worse. I haven't tried fluconozole because I have a heart condition and it's not safe for me to take.

I have no predisposing conditions (except a history of antibiotic treatments, but I've literally taken probiotics, eat fermented foods daily, and had a faecal transplant before, I could not do any more to support my microbiome than what I'm doing). 

I'm intolerant to fructose and its metabolites so the only sweet thing I have is a few teaspoons of pure glucose powder in a tea or coffee once or twice a day- no table sugar, no added sugar, no fruit. I don't smoke at all, I don't drink alcohol, I haven't had sex in more than six months, I don't have any STDs, I've never had a bacterial infection.

Where to go from here? I'm sick of it, it's embarrassing, and I'm sure it's not healthy for me.",2,1742491867.0,Healthyhooha,4,1.0,False

1jfuetg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jfuetg,E.P. Carrillo New Wave Connecticut Stellas Review – A Smooth & Flavorful Connecticut Experience,"Known for pushing the boundaries of traditional Connecticut cigars, Ernesto Perez-Carrillo crafted this blend to offer more depth and character than the typical mild Connecticut smoke. Featuring an Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper over Nicaraguan and Dominican long-fillers, the New Wave Connecticut delivers a silky-smooth yet flavorful experience that caters to both beginners and seasoned smokers alike.

On a sunny afternoon, a beer in hand, I decided to light one up and see if this modern Connecticut lived up to the hype.


Presentation & Cold Draw

The New Wave Connecticut Stellas is a beautifully rolled cigar, with a silky, golden-brown wrapper that’s nearly flawless. The seams were tight, the veins were minimal, and the construction felt firm yet slightly springy to the touch.

On the cold draw, I picked up sweet cream, cedar, and a hint of honey, with a faint touch of white pepper and  faint vanilla flavour in the background. The draw was effortless, setting the stage for a smooth, easygoing smoke.


First Third – Creamy & Approachable

The cigar lit up perfectly, immediately producing plentiful, creamy smoke. The first puffs were silky and smooth, with sweet cedar, buttered toast, and roasted almonds leading the way.

A mild white pepper spice was present on the retrohale, but it was subtle—just enough to keep things interesting. As the burn progressed, a touch of honey sweetness appeared, balancing out the creamy core. The burn line was razor-sharp, and the ash held firm, reflecting E.P. Carrillo’s renowned craftsmanship.


Second Third – Smooth Complexity

Moving into the second third, the flavors became more layered. The cedar and toastiness remained, but now notes of light caramel, vanilla, and baking spices started to emerge. The peppery kick softened, allowing a buttery smooth texture to take center stage.

At this point, the cigar settled into a perfectly balanced medium body, still mild enough for newer smokers but with enough complexity to keep veterans engaged. The burn remained perfect, requiring no touch-ups.


Final Third – A Satisfying, Elegant Finish

As the final third began, the creaminess evolved into a toasted nut and light leather profile, while the honey sweetness faded into a more subtle nougat-like flavor. The cigar never lost its smoothness, and the pepper on the retrohale remained minimal but present.

The cedar and spice notes became slightly more pronounced toward the end, giving the cigar a refined yet satisfying finish. It remained balanced and enjoyable down to the nub.


Final Thoughts

The E.P. Carrillo New Wave Connecticut Stellas is a fantastic modern Connecticut that delivers silky smooth flavors with just enough complexity to keep things interesting. It’s an ideal morning smoke, pairing beautifully with coffee or tea, but also works as a midday or early evening option for those looking for a relaxing, creamy cigar.

With a smoke time of around 45 minutes, it’s a great short smoke for those who want refinement without heaviness. Would I smoke it again? Without question. This a great Connecticut-wrapped cigars for those who appreciate flavor, balance, and expert construction.",3,1742491826.0,cigar_refuge,0,1.0,False

I'd ideally like to break the fast with eggs, peanut butter and berries (not mixed together). Obviously the second two are easy, but what's a good way to have eggs on the go? 

I don't want to be the guy peeling boiled eggs due to the smell, and my workmates are kind of cringey and would make a ""joke"" of me scrambling eggs every day in the work kitchen, I try to avoid small talk and the kitchen is the hotspot for that, just getting a coffee requires me to strategically dash in and out.

So today, I had a standard Worksearch Review meeting with my WC at 2:30pm. I arrived 3 minutes early; a little later than I normally would've, but it's been a lovely sunny day, and I stopped for a coffee in town first. Upon entering the Jobcentre I was immediately pounced upon by a receptionst with a clipboard who told me to remove my sunglasses. My hand was already reaching for my face to do just that, but whatever. ""Sorry"", she carried on ""you can't obscure your face in here""... ""It's fine"", I replied, I was about to take them off anyway. ""Appointment with Jeff at half past?"" I said, in a polite tone - ""Half past what?"" She replied... ""Half past two"", I elaborated. I was sorely tempted to point out that I wouldn't be here if my appointment was at any other time, but I held my tongue! She then starts scanning her clipboard for my name, and flips on to the second page, missing my appointment completley (my name starts with a B). ""It's on the first page"" I point out helpfully - ""Bryer, appointment with Jeff, 2:30, third floor"" (this is not my first rodeo). She ignores me entirely, and flips over to the next page, and starts scanning another list of names that I'm not on. ""I'm not seeing you..."" she says accusingly, as if I'd be trying to sneak into the Jobcentre on the first day of spring for shits and giggles... ""First page"" I say again. ""B for Bryer"". She then flips back to the SECOND page and starts running her finger down that list again. ""Well, you're not on here. Are you sure it's today?"". At this point, the burly G4S guy comes over, takes the clipboard from her hands, flips over to the first page, and, without looking, points to my name near the TOP of the damn list. I shit you not, she looks at the clock on the wall and tells me ""Cutting it a bit fine aren't you""... ""Not really"" I shoot back ""I was three minutes early when I arrived"". Of course, this clipboard wielding toad can't stand being challenged. ""I'm hoping you wouldn't arrive to a job interview with only three minutes to spare, would you?"" ""You should be striving to be at least 10-15 minutes early"". Clearly needing  to have the last word she assures me that she'll ""let it go this time"", but warns me to ""take my appointments more seriously in the future""... FML!!!

1jfubis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZenlessZoneZero/comments/1jfubis/newcomer_here_this_game_made_my_adhd_physically/,Newcomer here: this game made my ADHD physically hurt.,"Hello. Started playing like 2 days ago. Even though I'm not a fan of gacha games, I was bored enough to give this game a try. So far, I've been liking the game... when the game itself allows me to **play the game**. Not gonna lie, there's too much padding, both gameplay and narrative-wise. For example, during Chapter One: was it really necessary to play as the Cunning Hares during the recording... not finish the record... unlock three different side activities (like drinking coffee)... meet and ditch Corin... **and then finish watching the recording?**

But that's not the main point of this post. I've reached Chapter Two, I just finished the Hollow Zero tutorial... and I'm overwhelmed. Remember my previous point about unlocking side activities? Okay, so when the game goes:

>Congratulation on reaching a new chapter. Here you have 2 new quests.  
Congratulation on completing one of the quests. Before you complete the other, here's the tutorial for a new activity.  
Congratulation on starting the new activity tutorial. Here's an explanation of the three sub-activities this activity has.

Congratulation on starting the story mission, here's a tutorial of a new game mode.  
Congratulations on trying the new game mode, here's an explanation on three different sub-modes in this mode.

And so, and so, and so on, my ADHD triggers. By the end of the whole Hollow Zero it was starting to hurt my head just trying to make sense of all the gibberish the game was throwing at me at once. What was wrong with Story, Battle and Exploration Commissions? Was the Slay the Spire-map really necessary?

This game has too much fluff for my ADHD. Going from one stage to the next takes friggin' forever since the game needs to introduce new mechanics, concepts and modes constantly. You wanna know what has been the most fun for me so far? Going into Free Practice, enabling Invulnerable enemies and, you know, **play the game.**

And that's what frustrates me: the actual gameplay is fun. I don't want to skip the story (even though so far it has been pretty meh), but I may have to start doing for my physical well-being.",0,1742491594.0,ZenlessZoneZero,7,0.07,False
1jfuba8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LanceHedrick/comments/1jfuba8/078_ssp_initial_thoughts/,078 SSP Initial Thoughts,"TLDR: My first impression of the SSP 78mm burrs are that they are slightly less clear than the 64mm MP burrs but offer more body, more sweetness, and more balanced acidity in the cup for espresso. I am very happy with them for light roast espresso and are preferred over my other grinders. For pourover, they are very good and generally follow the same trend, but as such, I don't think I like them as much as the 64mm MPs due to the lesser clarity. I will continue to season them and experiment. 



I recently got my Timemore 078 SSP with the 15% off coupon direct from Timemore. The few reviews that were available did not mention much about the espresso quality other than ""yup, it can do espresso."" Everyone was comparing it to the Turbo burrs and the ULFs for pourover. I, however, was looking for an espresso grinder primarily, and decided to take a chance on these burrs. This was for 2 reasons: One, I really wanted a 078 due to the value for money and the larger burrs, and two, because 15% off basically meant the burrs were $150 which I will likely never find for that price again. I was afraid the stock espresso burrs would be more traditional than I wanted.

  
I had been grinding for espresso using my 1Zpresso X-pro and my Ode Gen 2 with SSP MP burrs. Plus I have a ZP6 for pourover. I'm pulling my espresso on a dimmer-modded Delonghi Stilosa. My water is filtered though a Zero pitcher and I use Lotus drops to make the ""Light and Bright (espresso)"" recipe. I drink light roasts and I use the same coffees for espresso and pourover, alternating between naturals and washed. I like high clarity for my pourover brews but was wanting just a bit more body and juicyness for my espresso than the 64mm MPs were giving, while still preserving the acidity. The X-pro was preferred for many coffees, but I really got sick of hand grinding. (My Ode worked just fine, if anyone was wondering, and I converted it to stepless. It never seemed to struggle with the espresso grinding.)

  
I have seasoned my 078 it with 5lbs/2.2 kilos of dark roast coffee. I know this far from fully seasoned but it was a start and I didn't want to spend more money on coffee that I wasn't going to drink.

  
I am finding the espresso to be bright, juicy and sweet with more body than the 64mm MPs, but certainly not syrup. I'm generally pulling 1:2.5-1:3 ratio shots due to the light roasts, anyways. They have been easy to dial in and I haven't had any bad shots from them so far. With stock calibartion, I'm grinding on 2.5-3 so far with good results. For pourover, I'm grinding around 16 on the dial and am getting very delicious, juicy brews, but with more blended flavors than the ZP6 or the 64mm MPs. I'm preferring either of those for pourover but am very satisfied with the 78mm SSPs for espresso, it's the best espresso I've pulled yet and I think they're doing exactly what I wanted which was basically the 64mm MPs with a bit more body and balance. 

  
I will keep using the grinder to get it fully seasoned and continue to compare, but I'm considering selling my Ode and keeping the ZP6 and the 078 for pourover. The 64mm MPs are preferred right now for pourover, but the ZP6 can give me awesome clarity and the 78mm burrs are still really great; I don't think i would be unhappy letting the Ode go to save space on my counter. I will give it a few months to let the burrs settle before I make that decision, but these are my initial thoughts and I'm hoping they might help someone else considering these burrs for espresso or an all-around option.

Unfortunately I don't have health insurance, so I did not try the main, but it was really tempting. It smelled perfectly fine, with a faint worchestershire smell but I couldn't risk it.

Ruined components:

Coffee Creamer. Solid chunk of yellow something. Nibbled a bit of it, and it was pretty gross.

Lemon/Lime drink mix. Exposed to moisture, and was a solid chunk of material, couldn't even get it out of the package.

Cheese spread: Sweet holy God...opened it and it punched in the face with a vile smell. Took picture, and threw it away.

Components tried:

Coffee. Nice smooth coffee, I've had better, I've had worse.

Cookie Bar. Still crunchy after 37 years! It tasted fine, but did have a weird preservative/chemical aftertaste. Id give it a 5.6-6/10.

Crackers. Somebody needs to write the DOD and get these things back in MREs. They were intact, crunchy, a hint of saltiness, and went perfectly with some jelly from a Spanish ration. Just perfection in a pouch. 10/10.

Dehydrated peaches. What a damn great snack. Light, crunchy, fantastic smell, and even better taste. A really great component. 9/10.

Do you also get bursaries from the uni? Santugon and tapat parin ba ang political parties? What help can a MIDDLE class expect? (not even talking about the people who cant afford at all since theyre usually getting the help) I hope student loans are readily available to those who need it.

Tuition ko sa CCS on average was 55k (65k ata pinakamataas ko if 21 units + lab class). Then food was probs 80 pesos for the rosemary chicken sa agno. Then meron yung chicken just beside goks (literally like the chicken from Good Friends) was probably like 90(?) and yung froyo dun sa ground floor ng isang building katabi ng andrew was soooo good it cost me around 60 pesos for a cuppa.

I've been constipated for over 3 days now and when I say constipated I mean not a single bowel movement not a single urge to go. My issue is there could be multiple causes behind this and therefore I'm not sure what solutions will work.

I injured my back 3 days ago and this started alongside constant stomach cramps. Since then the back pain has continued (across the middle section and lower to some degree). As a result:
- my appetite decreased quite a bit and I haven't eaten as much as I normally do 
- I'm barely moving due to the back pain but do try to walk around when I can 
- feel like all my core muscles are tense and this might be impacting my pelvic floor 

So for the last 3 days I have tried sticking to fibrous foods, drinking a lot of water after (including warm water), apple, orange juice, some coffee, olive oil, sugar free gum, hot water bottle, senna laxative (just have me more bad cramps) self massages etc and not a hint of an urge to go. 

The only progress I have had is particularly when trying to belly breathe which I think helps loosen pelvic floor?? I have been able to pass gas. Strangle the cramps aren't as bad as they were a few days ago. 

If it's a muscle thing then the fibre stuff might be a red herring but again maybe not due to not eating much at first.

I have ordered to glycerin suppositories to try tomorrow and will continue with the diet. 

Is there anything else worth trying in the meantime like Milk of Magnesium or prune juice? If not of that works is a home enema the last resort?

Also not sure at which point I should start to get more concerned and seek medical advice.

Mine is a 15 week old Jack Russel x Norfolk Terrier. 

**EVERYTHING I WISH I KNEW (UK)**

\- Puppies may not have fear early on but they can learn it and begin to show it as they develop. Make sure to continue training fireworks sounds and loud noises with treats, especially before bonfire night. There's an audio library by the Dogs Trust that has sounds puppies often find scary.

\- Treats treats treats. At first I was worried about overfeeding my puppy so only gave treats during designated training moments. Now, every single time he does something right he gets a YES/good boy and a treat. It has meant he learns so much quicker. Just don't even bother putting food in a bowl and give it all to them in training. 

\- Yak chews are a God send but be wary - they can be too hard for their teeth and crack into chokable pieces. I soak mine in warm water for 10 mins before if I can, and watch before it gets too small. 

\- When you understand that puppies sleep more than they are awake, you get your life back. Enforce those naps because they will not go to sleep themselves. Biting ankle? Nap. Running into sofa? Nap. I usually wait 1.5 hours after he was last up and then put him to bed again. He wines a bit then sleeps. 

\- Covering the crate/taking them out of sight of people/food can be really helpful to settle them. Puppies wine loads out of FOMO. Saying that, I still try to walk past/into the room of my sleeping puppy/put TV on so that he gets used to sleeping around sounds. 

\- Routine is the only way I get stuff done. I can plan to do all the things I need to do including leaving the house for around 30 mins/1 hour if I need to, as long as it falls into one of the windows where the puppy is sleeping in the crate (e.g. between 9-11, between 1-3, between 4.30-6 etc.). I've left him alone for a longer period once at a late restaurant sitting (9pm-12) as he sleeps through the night. 

\- When you first start walking on a lead with the puppy after vaccines, they won't be able to go very far. Don't expect going from no lead walking to hikes - our puppy can make it about 500m in 30 minutes. He stops/sniffs things/gets distracted. It's another new skill.

\- You can't go into a lot of UK supermarkets with a dog, but there are lots of coffee shops and pubs that allow them (in London at least). Restaurants are a mix.  

  
What else have you learned at this early stage???? I read these Reddit blogs all the time, so hope this is useful to someone out there. ",21,1742490859.0,puppy101,6,1.0,False

Soon after I brought it home, the leaves on the bottom began browning. it starts with a small dot that grows. the stem is also browning. 

I water it whenever I notice the leaves begin to droop (it’s due for a watering) and it’s next to a bright window that receives indirect light. 

Has anyone dealt with this before? i’m hoping a repot and change in location will solve this problem and it’s not a fungal infection. If it is a fungal infection, will propagations also be doomed?

It has dynamic locations + organizations perfectly tailored to YOUR story - you can explore them as well!","Hey r/LifeSimulators!

A while back I shared my project [TheLifesim.com](http://TheLifesim.com) with you all, and your response was incredible! 

Since then, I've been working non-stop to make this text-based life simulator even more immersive, and I'm excited to share the latest updates.

*(see screenshots at the end of the post)*

# What makes this life sim unique?

For those who missed my first post, TheLifesim lets you experience life as literally anyone, anywhere in the world through rich, text-based gameplay. And now, it's evolved into something deeper:

1. Rich, dynamic world: as you play, you'll discover and interact with:
   * **People**: as you advance, new people will pop up in your life. I've tested with 100+ people (there is no limit to this - can you get to 1000? idk😯) - each with their own personalities and stories
   * **Locations**: discover places like test tracks, coffee shops, luxury apartments, corporate offices, etc - they all depend on the life you live (also no limit as of now)
   * **Organizations**: interact with sponsors, employers, clubs, and other organizations unique to your lifestyle (same, no limits to how many - things may break 😋)
   * **Concepts**: engage with important ideas and themes that shape your character's worldview and experiences
2. Free-Roam Mode: new tabbed interface lets you explore freely or automatically continue the life
3. Consciousness Stream: experience your character's internal thoughts as they react to the changing world around them

# What people love about it

Early users have been especially drawn to:

1. The thrill of learning more about that unique lifestyle (of a Japanese Sushi Chef, Racing Driver, CEO etc)
2. The ability to live any life, and populate your world authentically
3. The emergent storytelling that creates unique narratives every playthrough

# What's next?

# I'm actively working on:

1. Enhanced character relationships with more complex interactions
2. Better memory & context awareness
3. Improved visualization of your life journey

**Important note**: The simulator is still in beta and has some obvious bugs (!) that I'm actively fixing as we speak! **Things may & will break!** I apologize in advance - report the bugs on discord directly to me!

# Try it yourself!

The simulator is available at [TheLifesim.com](http://TheLifesim.com) 

Join our growing community on Discord where you can:

* Share stories from your simulations
* Suggest new features and improvements
* Connect directly with me (the founder)

Left my former profession due to toxic work environments and people trying to get me fired constantly. It wasn’t ever a well-paying career, plus I had an ex completely drain me of my savings (and still owes me $400 that I won’t see). I took a seasonal job and thought I could find something full time when the season was over. 

Turns out I’m either overqualified or under qualified for even basic office positions. I picked up a very poor paying very part time job. I has to take out a loan to cover 2 months of rent this winter and I’m still 2 months behind. (Hence going to Mom & Dad.) I can barely buy groceries. Unemployment doesn’t cover much. Some weeks they think I’ve worked too many hours so I don’t get anything. Unfortunately I’m in a high COL area that pretty much becomes a ghost town/highway in the winter. 

I don’t own property outside of my car. My spending habits have decreased significantly but everyone knows the cost of groceries and rent have skyrocketed. Luckily my student loans are in a deferment or I’d be living out of my car. 

I will occasionally treat myself to an iced coffee or an ice cream from places in town, but other than that, I don’t eat out. I don’t travel and I thrift 90% of my wardrobe. I do have a dog and while at times he’s expensive, he’s practically my child and I will make sure he has food before I have food. 

It’s just the second I think I’m caught up, bam, there’s another expense. Had to replace all my windshield wipers due to an ice storm (1 arm broke, the others ripped.) My job failed to tell me I’d have to cover my health insurance premiums for the months I’m not working, and boom, another $700 I don’t have. I need new work shoes and the dog needs to go for his annual vet visit. I can’t win. 

I’m looking into rental assistance before I talk to my parents and I’m still applying to jobs. I don’t qualify for any more loans at the moment and I’ll be heading to the food shelf Tuesday. I know a lot of people are in this boat (especially in my area) and I just don’t know how to make it work. I don’t want to move back to my hometown but I may have to.

So me (24F) and my bf (25M) have been dating for almost 5 months, but I'm already emotionally drained. At first he was really sweet and caring, but at some point everything started to feel like a rollercoaster. He constantly tries to make me feel insecure. For context I'm trying to recover from anorexia, and he knows that. But still he makes fun of chubby people in front of me, he constantly judges me for what I eat, he even told me that my thighs are big. Then makes me feel like the crazy one when I say that these things hurt me because he says ""well but if I didn't like your body I wouldn't be all over you all the time, don't you think?"" 
He doesn't like that I go to the gym because he ""doesn't like when women are too muscular"". 
He even pressured me to eat things that I didn't want to eat, though it hasn't happened again recently. 
He also likes to instill doubts in my mind about the chances of him cheating on me because he says that you can be 100% sure of your relationship but can never know when you meet someone that makes you question everything. Which makes me feel like everything I can do would never be enough. 
He also puts me down because I had to drop out of school so I don't have a degree, using this to belittle my intelligence. 
And the thing that makes me go insane on top of these things, is that he still hangs out with the girl he fell in love with before meeting me. They never dated, but he keeps seeing her at her work place, goes out for coffee with her, exchanges texts with her (where she occasionally lets him know her work shift so that he can visit her) and he even said that if she asked him to he would probably go out with her and her friends. And when I tried to explain to him that this is messing with my head, he said that I do the same thing because I OCCASIONALLY chat with my ex gf. I tried to explain to him that it's not the same thing because me and her broke up a year and a half ago, but we've known each other for 7 years and now we're like best friends even though we talk every once in a while and also she lives miles away from here. Not to mention, that someone said that he and this girl have been seen being... let's say affectionate in public.
But still, I can't leave him.

EDIT: this to say that I constantly feel like I'm walking on eggshells because I never know when my actions or words won't match his expectations. I feel guilty every time I refuse to do something, in some occasions he even acted passive aggressive when I said that I wasn't in the mood for sexual stuff. He also says that not a lot of people would be willing to deal with some things about me that he is willing to accept, making me feel like if I leave him then I would be alone forever.",1,1742490550.0,abusiverelationships,2,1.0,False

I just want my drinks to be decent, like at least Starbucks level. And Starbucks is not that great.

  
I got into espresso with a random espresso machine (Laekert was the brand) and a $30 standalone grinder. This grinder didn't even have finer/coarser settings - the brand was Dr Mills Coffe grinder. I was able to produce espresso that was decently tasty and worked well in Lattes which is what I mainly have. I got the Delonghi last week and followed the guide of throwing the first 5-7 batches, but every single pull I have is just undrinkable. I figured the Delonghi would be easier and better, I didn't realize I was in for a world of tinkering.

  
So far, I've adjusted the heat (its now at max), tried a shot on every grind setting, and changed my regular beans from a bag of Lavazza to fresh beans (Eclipse - Onyx Coffee). 

  
Is there anything else I'm missing here? The shots are sour and the consistency is closer to water than anything. I would also appreciate any recommendations on coffee machines that are easier to work.",1,1742490143.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

However, sad to say my HP elite book was the only crossfire and when I realized it was wet (in sleep mode not turned off) I immediately went to the bathroom and tried my best to dry it off there initially. I understand it was a stupid thing to do to try to take it out of sleep mode but I did this after drying it in the hopes that it was not that much liquid which had effected it. The keyboard turned on but not the screen. I immediately force turned it off once seeing this. It is turned off now in a canvas bag inside a laptop bag filled with desiccants. There are two desiccants - silica gel and calcium chloride. As I understand it, the calcium chloride will liquify as it sucks up the coffee however the amount with the canvas bag as a barrier in between should not be sufficient to re-wet the laptop. Now I'm making a post to ask a) is there anything else I can do at this point ? And b) please tell me what are my chances my laptop is completely done for?

1jftnvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1jftnvq/mcas_in_need_of_general_advice_med_help/,MCAS: In need of General Advice & Med Help!,"Hello! This is my first post on reddit. I’ve been reading up on plenty of posts on here that have just been so helpful. 

My health background: 
I was diagnosed with POTS last year in February, (post covid 2023 December - though I’m sure I had a mild form my whole life as I had flare ups once every few years and didn’t know what caused them) and am in the process of getting diagnosed with MCAS. I’ve had severe seasonal allergies all throughout my life, and last year, began responding randomly/negatively to peanuts, wine, cheese, etc. Some days I could tolerate them, and others, meh. I also could never eat bananas, sugar, or drink coffee during the springtime as I had oral reactions to these as well. These were all somewhat “mild” and so I brushed them off and moved along. I also had experienced some pretty traumatic events with family and friends the past few years (thank goodness everything is much better now), but during those times, I had small red patches show up on different places all over my body. I’m pretty sure I’ve had psoriasis for 6 years as well - I went on the candida diet in 2019 and it got rid of it completely - but I couldn’t maintain it as it was too strict. That’s a story for another day. 

Fast forward to the past few months - from 2024 August to November I had about 5 courses of antibiotics (due to sickness - and actually, I found out I never even needed a couple of these courses as my symptoms stemmed from eustachian tube dysfunction), I then contracted rhinovirus in late December which put me in the hospital for 4 days (and for those 4 days + 3 days after being home I couldn’t eat due to horrific dysphagia). I nearly died - very scary and life-changing experience. After getting better, I contracted EBV in late January, and it was actually fairly mild. It wasn’t until I had EBV symptoms that I began having random allergic reactions to everything. And MAJOR GI upset. I finally met with an allergist this week (yes it took this long lol) who said I experienced an anaphylaxis reaction (NOT anaphylactic shock) during this time as well. I didn’t even know but brushed it off after taking a tiny dose of allegra and heading straight to sleep. I wonder if my histamine bucket was finally overloaded? Anyway. It’s been a CRAZY year and a half, all things considered. 

So. I just started taking pepcid and levocetrizine and I feel like a zombie. Shaky, exhausted, tingly limbs, it feels like I’m moving in slow motion. Is this normal when first starting anti-histamines? Will this improve as I keep taking them? I also feel kinda nauseous but the pepcid has helped a lot with my GI issues - though I seemed to be helping them a lot through NS regulation. 

I also have a flight tomorrow. And I don’t want to be feeling this way. I flew earlier this month with no issues, but all things considered - and the pollen count being what it is - I won’t say I’m not scared. I just don’t quite know what to do. 

Any advice would be appreciated. On managing the illness, potential holistic healing, maintaining sanity, on flying, and even on these meds. I know that posting things like this aren’t just benefitting me - but anyone else who may be struggling in a similar fashion. It’s been very hard. Thank you. ❤️",0,1742489992.0,MCAS,1,0.5,False
1jftnlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SevenFigureAuthorTips/comments/1jftnlv/author_rebecca_hamilton_tips_on_how_writers_can/,Author Rebecca Hamilton Tips on How Writers' Can Legally Grow Their Wealth,"ALRIGHTY...who's ready for some actionable advice on turning those hard-earned royalties into a wealth-building machine? I promise this is doable for most people (I started investing LONG before I was a six figure author). And hopefully those with additional tips will weigh in, too! 

This is, after all, one of the best parts of self-publishing industry: where the good guys of the writing community band together to lift one another up! Since I’ve learned a thing or two about making money work harder than I do (and trust me, I work hard!), I figured it might benefit some of you all here, too! 

Whether you’re just dipping your toes into self-publishing or you’re a seasoned pro, I hope these tips  help you grow your wealth legally, sustainably, and with a little fun along the way :) 

**Reinvesting Royalties**

If you've got royalties rolling in from your latest bestseller, then first of all: high five! But here’s the thing: letting that cash just chill in your bank account is like leaving a manuscript unfinished. It’s got potential, but it’s not doing much for you. Something I'm thankful to have learned early into my self publishing career (back when I was just publishing as Rebecca Hamilton and before I built Seven Figure Author Career). 

This post won't JUST be talking about reinvesting your royalties into your books, though. This will cover a diversified way to grow wealth beyond the page :) Of course, re-investing in your business is a no-brainer, like watering your garden to grow more flowers, but I want to show you what's possible if you don't stop there!

First, take a chunk of those royalties and put them to work in places like stocks, Roth IRAs, or other safe investments. Why? Because royalties are awesome, but they’re tied to your writing grind. Diversifying gives you multiple streams of passive income, so you’re not sweating it if you take a break from releasing books—or even advertising—down the road.

**Why Low Risk Investing Beats the Bank**

Sticking your money in a savings account these days is like hoping a paperback will spontaneously hit the bestseller list without anyone knowing it’s been released. Inflation nibbles away at your cash faster than you can say ""writer’s block."" That’s why I’ve found it better to invest in smart options that grow my wealth over time. 

* Stocks (Mainstay Edition): Think big, stable companies—Apple, Microsoft, or Coca-Cola. These mainstay stocks aren’t sexy, but they’re reliable. My beginner tip? Buy during dips (when prices drop) and hold for 5-10 years. Historically, the stock market averages about 7-10% annual growth after inflation—way better than what banks are offering! (And, in fact, your banks are investing your money anyway - except they’re only giving you a small amount of the profit. This is what banks being FDIC insured is all about. Because if they lose your money, insurance will cover it … up until a certain amount. (And this is why if your savings are above a certain amount, it’s better to have that money spread across multiple banks.) 
* Roth IRAs are fantastic as well, and I’ll dive into that in a moment here. But essentially, you put in after-tax money, it grows tax-free, AND you withdraw it tax-free in retirement. IE: You’re not paying taxes on the growth, like you would well when selling stock. It’s like a gift to future you!
* Diversified Funds (ETFs): Not ready to pick stocks? Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) spread your money across tons of companies, reducing risk while still growing your cash.

These beat the bank because they grow. With investing, a dollar today could be $2, $5, or more in a decade, while in savings, it’s still…a dollar (minus inflation’s bite).

**Rebecca Hamilton Gets Geeky with Roth IRA Magic** 

Are you ready to geek out over Roth IRAs for a minute? Because I’m obsessed with how this little gem can transform your future. Say you max out your Roth IRA every year (in 2025, that’s $7,000 if you’re under 50). With an average 7% annual return, here’s what happens:

* 10 Years: $7,000/year turns into \~$103,000.
* 20 Years: That jumps to \~$309,000.
* 40 Years: Hold onto your pens—it’s \~$1.4 million!

That’s assuming you start from zero and just keep maxing it out. This is something I wish I had started doing MUCH earlier in my life, but if, like me, you’re late to the game, no sweat—even a decade of contributions can set you up nicely. This is a big deal for authors because we might not write forever. Royalties could slow down if you stop releasing or advertising. A Roth IRA is your safety net—a passive income stream that grows while you sip coffee and plot your next novel (or nap, no judgment!).

**Beginner Investing Tips: Keep It Simple, Win Big**

New to investing? Don’t worry—I’ve got your back! Here are my go-to tips for self-publishing writers stepping into the wealth game:

* Start with Mainstays: Pick well-known companies with a track record. They’re less likely to tank overnight.
* Buy Low, Hold Long: Snag stocks during market dips (think sales at your favorite bookstore!) and sit tight for 5-10 years. Patience pays off. (Though you can sell some off when needed - I try not to sell unless I’ve already gotten a higher return than it would have made sitting in the bank.) 
* Automate It: Set up automatic contributions to your Roth IRA or brokerage account. Less temptation to spend, more growth. Even if it’s just $5 a week, DO IT. Something is better than nothing. 
* Don’t Panic: Markets wiggle—sometimes they dip. (We’re in one right now that I suspect is a market correction and we will start to see slow growth again over the next few months - but please keep in mind, I am not a financial advisor. I’m just sharing my advice, and you should talk to someone who is licensed and qualified before doing anything!) For me, though, I just stay calm, hold tight, and trust the long-term trend.

I’m no Wall Street wizard. I just started small, stayed consistent, and it helped my wealth snowball beyond the initial royalties! 

**Getting Started**

Start by setting aside a percentage of your royalties—10%, 20%, whatever feels doable—and pop it into a Roth IRA or a low-cost ETF. Dip your toes into mainstay stocks during the next market hiccup. If you’re benefiting from writing those epic stories, it’s time to build an  epic financial future, too. 

Multiple passive income streams—like stock dividends, Roth IRA growth, or even rental income if you’re feeling fancy—mean you’re not reliant on one source. It’s freedom. It’s peace of mind. And for us authors, who pour our souls into our work, it’s a way to ensure our creativity pays off long after the last page is written.

**Royalties Aren’t Forever**

Here’s the heart of it, my dear writing community: royalties are fantastic—I’ve built many Six and Seven Figure Author Careers on them—but they’re not guaranteed forever. Maybe you’ll write less later, or you just want to kick back and enjoy life without worrying about ad performance. That’s why diversifying is key.

I hope this helped and look forward to seeing what other tips authors in our community want to share!",1,1742489973.0,SevenFigureAuthorTips,0,1.0,False

I've read plenty of self-help books in my life, but I've never read anything that felt like a literal handbook on my parents. It's as if the author lived in my childhood house.

I'm no contact two months with my mum, and one with my dad. I'm open to LC with my mum in the future, but she's the one who went NC with me, so the ball's in her court. My middle brother reached out to ask me to renew contact with my ailing father, but I'm not at all ready to consider that, and to my relief my brother accepted that and will encourage my father to back off.

Both of these things together - the book and a little bit of sibling support - have really been reinforcing a feeling I had immediately after going NC: I'm living for myself, now.
I didn't realize how many of my insecurities and self-doubt and self-hatred were just my parents' voices. What I eat, how I work, how I spend my free time. I hate to say it, but even sex - my parents put me in the hands of a lot of sexually abusive people and I didn't realize living near home again had made me feel so unsafe in my own body.

I sat down and did some creative writing for the first time in two years. I'm loving cooking again. I'm excited to get back into art. It's easier to talk to strangers. I'm planning on visiting a coffee shop soon. My birthday is coming up in a couple weeks, and while it's also a traumaversary, AND I know they will probably try to reach out, I have them officially blocked now and my husband took two extra days off to support me through that weekend.

I'm still stressed, I'm still grieving, I'm still dealing with insomnia and nightmares, but it feels like a plug was pulled out and I can finally let all this tension drain out.

 Cut the small talk and have one on one time, go for  coffee or a walk. Join specific groups, online or offline, based on your interests, be it  book clubs, art classes, or support groups. These places tend to draw similar people. Finally,  be patient. Good friendships don’t happen overnight. This means being there, listening, and letting things  happen on their own time.

The Cadets followed in near-perfect formation, their steps measured, precise. Lórien, in contrast, trailed behind them with an air of whimsical curiosity, taking in everything with those bright, unblinking golden eyes.

Moreau was too tired to question why she was still here.

The Officer’s Mess was quieter than the general mess hall. It was a space for senior staff, ranking officers, and select personnel—one of the few places on the ship where things were supposed to be civilized.

Moreau had a bad feeling that would not last long.

The moment they entered, conversations dipped. Not because of him—Moreau was well known here, and his presence barely warranted a glance. But the Imperials? That was something new.

Eyes flickered toward the three white-clad Cadets, taking them in with wary curiosity. Unlike the Dominion, where rigid hierarchy dictated everything, the Terran Alliance had more fluidity. Rank mattered, but respect was earned, not assumed. And right now, the Aegis’s officers were gauging whether these Imperial Cadets deserved any.

Moreau grabbed a tray and motioned for them to follow suit. The food was standard—nutrient-dense rations, fresh produce where available, and coffee strong enough to make a lesser man see into the void. He took a seat at one of the long tables, expecting—hoping—for silence.

He should have known better.

Primus leaned forward first, resting his elbows on the table, fingers loosely clasped together. His blood-red eyes gleamed with interest. “Tell me, High Envoy… how many wars have you fought in?”

Moreau took a sip of his coffee. “Enough.”

Primus smirked. “And your personal kill count?”

Moreau arched a brow. “I don’t keep track.”

Primus scoffed, clearly unimpressed by that answer. “A pity. I thought you would value your accomplishments more.”

Moreau exhaled slowly through his nose before taking a sip of coffee. *This is going to be a long meal.*

Secundus, seated beside Primus, was far more direct. “What is the extent of your authority?”

“Extensive,” Moreau said dryly.

Secundus narrowed her eyes. “Elaborate.”

“I answer to my superiors in the Diplomatic Corps, but in my role, I have significant operational freedom. I can broker treaties, declare conflicts, and, if necessary, execute military action in the name of the Terran Alliance.”

Secundus nodded, absorbing this information. “And your strategic philosophy?”

“Win, preferably without losing any soldiers.”

She blinked. “That’s it?”

Moreau shrugged. “That’s all that matters.”

Secundus frowned, but before she could push further, Tertius, who had been uncharacteristically quiet, spoke up.

“What is your favorite food?”

Moreau paused mid-sip. “…What?”

Tertius stared at him with unsettling neutrality. “Your favorite food.”

Moreau sighed. “Steak.”

“What color and size are your shoes?”

Moreau looked down. “Black… size thirteen.”

“What color is your undershirt?”

Moreau narrowed his eyes. “Also black.”

Tertius nodded as if this was deeply important to some question or equation.

Then, with the same neutral tone, the same blank expression, he asked—

“Are you mating with your AI?”

Moreau choked on his coffee.

For a split second, he nearly launched himself across the table. His first thought was to throttle the Cadet, to demand what in the actual hell kind of question that was.

But before he could react further, he noticed something.

The Officer’s Mess had gone silent.

At the far end of the room, Captain Graves had turned her head slightly, her expression unreadable—but Moreau could feel the amusement radiating from her.

Nearby, Lieutenant Shaw who was sitting with several of the Horizon Initiative members had frozen mid-bite, eyes locked on Moreau.

Sergeant Ward, Horizon’s tech expert, who had just happened to sit nearby, was staring into his tray as if questioning every decision that led him to this moment.

Staff Sergeant Holm, Horizon’s demolitionist, had fully stopped eating. She wasn’t even pretending not to listen.

Even Lórien—who often played at being detached from human social norms—was watching him very closely, eyes shining with intrigue.

Moreau clenched his fists against the table. “Excuse me?”

Tertius tilted his head. “It is a reasonable question.”

“It is absolutely not a reasonable question.”

Secundus, to Moreau’s growing horror, backed him up.

“In the Dominion, procreation is mandatory,” she stated. “Every citizen must produce a minimum of two offspring to maintain population stability, though more are encouraged. If a Cadet has not chosen a mate by the end of their tenth year, one is selected for them.”

Moreau pinched the bridge of his nose. “That has nothing to do with—”

Tertius continued, unfazed. “Primus and Secundus are both preselected by the government. My case is different.”

Moreau hesitated. “…What do you mean?”

Tertius met his gaze. “I am in a relationship with the previous Tertius. Now the Quartus.”

Moreau blinked. “…Alright.”

“She attempted to kill me thrice. It was unsuccessful.”

Moreau blinked again.

Secundus sighed. “He means that she challenged him in combat repeatedly when he surpassed her in ranking. She lost. The conflict was resolved in a manner… possibly unique to Imperials.”

Moreau’s expression flattened. “Let me guess. She went from trying to kill you to wanting to date you?”

Tertius nodded once. “Correct.”

Primus smirked. “Some of our kind find emotional resolution in combat.”

Moreau dragged a hand down his face. “That is the least healthy romantic origin I’ve ever heard.”

Tertius was unfazed. “You did not answer the question.”

Moreau tensed. “Because it is not a question that needs answering.”

Tertius remained eerily calm. “You and the AI—Eliara. Can you produce offspring through technology? If not, is your relationship for psychological relief instead?”

Moreau gripped his coffee cup so hard it nearly cracked.

And that was when Captain Graves, who had been watching this disaster unfold with way too much amusement, decided to make things infinitely worse.

She leaned back in her chair, swirling her own coffee lazily before speaking.

“Well, Moreau?” she mused, voice utterly wicked. “I think we’d all love to hear your answer.”

Moreau hated her.

The entire mess hall was watching now.

Lórien looked absolutely delighted.

Primus was grinning.

Secundus was still waiting expectantly.

Tertius was calm. Patient. As if his question hadn’t just ruined breakfast before Moreau could even finish his coffee.

And Graves—Graves was taking way too much joy in this moment.

Moreau exhaled, inhaled, then exhaled again.

Then, slowly, he turned to Tertius.

“…I am not discussing my personal life with you.”

Tertius nodded, apparently satisfied. “Understood.”

Moreau thought he was safe.

Then Tertius asked—

“…But is it possible?”

Moreau stood up.

“I’m done. We’re leaving.”

Primus barely stifled a chuckle, somehow his tray was already empty as they all got up.

Secundus rose as well, though with significantly more composure.

Tertius calmly finished his drink as they took the trays to return.

Lórien, beaming, trailed behind them as they exited.

And behind them, Captain Graves chuckled, raising her coffee cup as a victory salute. “I didn’t hear a no!”

Moreau was certain of one thing.

1jfte3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1jfte3y/the_church_of_broken_promises_of_latterday_saints/,The Church of Broken Promises of Latter-day Saints,"We were promised a faith where we could know what was true and now we have to doubt our doubts.

We were promised priesthood power that could work miracles, but now we need the faith not to be healed.

We were promised the spirit would always be with us, but he departs when you put on a rated-R movie or get double piercings.

As missionaries, we were promised that the field was ripe and ready to harvest, but when we got 0 baptisms in two years, we went on to say that the mission was really to convert ourselves.

We were promised that God gives great gifts liberally to his children and those who ask, but now we're told he's not a cosmic vending machine.

We were promised agency, but according to Bednar agency means we must choose righteously.

We were promised prophets, seers, and revelators, but we're stuck with corporate administrators who update policy 15 years too late and announce temples that won’t ever be full.

We were promised salvation by Christ alone, yet to achieve salvation in the spirit world requires a worthy latter-day saint to get baptized for them, meaning a random latter-day saint and Jesus are both equally required for salvation. No wonder nobody thinks we’re Christians. 

We were promised eternal marriage with our spouse, yet when we die our husband may remarry and we'll suddenly be in a polygamous marriage.

We were promised that we could rely on church resources for the truth, yet at every turn ""anti-mormon"" books have been more accurate.

We were promised ordinances that would never be changed or altered, now the endowment drops a new release every year.

We were promised that the Book of Mormon was the most correct book on earth. Now it's not exactly historical, it's co-authored between God and Joseph in a loose translation... Or something like that.

We were promised the Book of Abraham was a translation of a papyrus written by his own hand, now it's just revelation Joseph received while he thought he was translating?

We were promised the JST of the Bible was an inspired translation, now we know it was plagiarized from a Bible commentary.

We were promised the native Americans were the descendants of the Lamanites, but now we're not really sure.

We were promised male and female were equal to God, but every aspect of the church is inherently patriarchal.

We were promised a Heavenly Father who loves us unconditionally, but he’ll keep us separate from him for eternity over a cup of coffee. 

We were promised a growing and thriving church, but now we have wards getting combined, stakes getting closed, meeting houses getting sold, and a distraction from it by announcing more temples.

We were promised leaders who were honest in their dealings with their fellow men, and we watched as they got fined by the SEC.

We were promised Christ-like love but watched as musket fire and hate went out to our LGBTQ loved ones.

We were promised the church leaders would never lead us astray, yet for over a century they spread false doctrine about black skin and curses and systemically perpetuated racism.

We were promised that we could receive personal revelation about important life decisions, but when it doesn't come we're told that ""God trusts us to make this decision on our own.""

Our patriarchal blessings promised things in life that didn't come true, but patriarchal blessings might come true in the next life, right?

We were promised an infinite atonement and a loving Christ that succors us according to our pains and afflictions, but when it came to mental illness we were told that ""it may be difficult to feel God's love with a mental disorder.""

We were promised that repentance was real and important, but when it came to the church, we were told that the church neither seeks nor offers apologies.

We were promised that all are alike unto God yet every handbook release has a different form of discrimination.

We were promised a common consent sustaining vote, but anyone who does not sustain gets excommunicated.

We were promised our garments would be a shield and protection, but instead we got body shame, yeast infections, and discomfort.

We were promised that by paying tithing the windows of heaven would open and pour out blessings, but instead, we learned to budget on 10% reduced income while the church grew immense wealth.

We were promised leaders with discernment and direction from God, yet those very same leaders sexually abused children and the leaders that called those leaders could not discern or prevent. Then after the fact, they chose to cover up.

We were promised a life-changing endowment of light, knowledge and power in the temple, but instead we learned about things we've already heard before, covenanted to obey our husbands, cut out our hearts, chanted in a circle, whispered passwords and did handshakes.

We were promised the temple was a place of peace, comfort and joy, but we were forced out of the celestial room for sitting longer than 5 minutes.  

We were promised that the church is the only way to true joy and every other path just leads to temporary happiness, yet many outside the church live fulfilling lives while those within are on antidepressants.

We were promised the best two years of our lives and instead got PTSD and toxic mission presidents with awful living conditions and useless mission doctors and therapists.

We were promised we have a heavenly mother, but when we asked more we were silenced, just like her.

We were promised that we could turn to the church for help with faith struggles, but we were met with judgment, dismissal, and the phrase, ""You're focusing on the wrong things.""

We were promised a church of civically minded and neighborly individuals, but instead, we bully small towns into letting us break zoning laws.

We were promised an amazing ward and church community, but now we have less time worshipping, fewer fun activities, increased chores and menial tasks, and a bunch of people on Sunday who quickly leave the chapel to get their soda from Maverick and don't even know who their ministering partner is.

We were promised this life would be a test, yet God only gives his true gospel to .02% of the population. How are the rest being fairly tested?

We were promised we would feel the spirit, but when we struggled to feel it, they told us it's because we always have the spirit and don't know what it's like without it.

We were promised the spirit would inspire our minds, but when we asked how to discern between our own thoughts and the spirit, they said ""stop worrying about it, as long as the thought is good it doesn’t matter.""

We were promised eternal families but instead, we are the only religion that believes in eternal separation imposed by God.

We were promised an enabling power of the atonement to overcome sin, but when it proved ineffectual to help the 95% of men in the church who can't stop masturbating, we just lowered the standard of worthiness.

We were promised that in the coming days, we'd see the greatest manifestations of the savior's power... I'm still taking my vitamins, but it looks like we're just getting more temple announcements.

No wonder why we leave this fucking church. If you're still trying to hold on, ask yourself, ""would I ever be friends with someone who broke this many promises?"" Nothing in this church was as it seemed and we spend all our time gaslighting ourselves that unanswered prayers, unfulfilled blessings, and unreceived revelation are a part of the program.

Bulldogs vs Bulldogs, friends! Having covered the spread in 5 of their last 7 outings and going 9-1 in their last 10, I've gotta roll with Gonzaga to pull off a victory today. As much as I liked some of Georgia's impressive recent upsets (including a win over the Florida Gators last month...) my wager is on the home team to cover and move on to the second round.

Since cannabis was legalized, my downstairs neighbor has been constantly growing cannabis plants. The issue is that whenever we open our windows, especially when the plants reach maturity, the strong smell fills our entire apartment.  Even when the windows are closed, the smell still comes from the bathrom so we always have to keep the door closed.

It’s not just inside our place either. The stairwell often smells like cannabis unless the windows are kept open all the time.

On top of that, he recently got himself a 400W sound system and regularly turn on electronic music. Our living room literally vibrates from the bass, sometimes during the day, sometimes late at night.

We’ve complained to the landlord several times, but he says there’s not much he can do. We’ve also tried speaking to the neighbor directly on multiple occasions, but nothing changes.

We’ve started calling the police when the noise continues past 10 PM, but by the time they show up, the music is usually off. Only once did they arrive while it was still playing.

I’m not against cannabis legalization at all, but it honestly feels like we’re living above an unregulated coffee shop/club, and we’re starting to feel like moving out is the only option. There is no one leaving under him and the other side of the building does not feel the vibration.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Is there anything else we can do?",1,1742488518.0,germany,1,1.0,False

 March 10th, 2020 Today was actually so good. My best friend, Liv, surprised me with a croissant and coffee this morning. When I opened the door to my living quarters, there she was, standing in the hallway. My heart skipped a beat looking at her. She was dressed in her facility uniform, holding a paper bag in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other. “Hey, Vivy.” She smiled. I seriously had to stop staring. This is your best friend, Vi, I reminded myself. Get a grip. “Hey, Livy,” I smiled back. “I got asurprise for you,” she said, grinning as she handed me the bag. “What is it?” I asked, peeking inside.
She laughed. “I’m not gonna tell you that. You gotta guess.” “Seriously, Livi?” I pouted, widening my eyes at her, trying to pull my best pleading face. That always worked on her. Apparently, not this time.  She smirked. “Oh, stop that, Vi,” she laughed. “That’s not gonna work. Just open the bag and find out for yourself.” Her voice—low, rich, warm —sent another flutter through my chest. “Okay, okay,” I giggled, finally looking inside.
There, nestled in the bag, was a chocolate croissant dusted with cinnamon. “Oh my gosh, Livy!” I gasped. “You didn’t have to!”She shrugged. “Well, too bad,” she teased. I beamed as I took a bite. “This is so good.” She placed the coffee on the table, then sat beside me. We ate breakfast together, laughing ,
enjoying the quiet moment.
It was perfect. After we finished, Liv walked me to Research Wing B, where I had to spend the day working on [REDACTED] — a new satellite launch for the forces of light. Administrator Viola was going to be so proud of our work. I was happy. But before she left, Liv suddenly pulled me into a hug. Not just a casual hug. A real one. Warm. Tight. Protective. “Livy,” I whispered breathlessly, melting into the solid strength of her arms, the steady sound of her heartbeat against my ear. “I’ll be back at lunch,” she whispered, her voice full of a smile. “Don’t miss me too much, Vivy.” She was teasing , but my heart still skipped. I
laughed. “I’ll try not to.” But she didn’t let go
just yet. She held me there a little longer, like she
really didn’t want to leave. Then, finally, she pulled back just enough to kiss my forehead, lingering for just a
second. My face burned. And then she stepped away, waiting until I
had opened the door to the lab before
turning to go. The day only got better from there. End

It was a convenient distraction—one Moreau *desperately* needed. Lórien was a chaos gremlin with more curiosity than sense, and if she’d truly been sitting in the galley eating raw flour for *hours*, he owed it to the kitchen staff to ensure she hadn’t dismantled anything important. Or, worse, started questioning people about their ""bonding rituals.""

Eliara walked beside him, arms loosely folded, her presence *different* in a way Moreau couldn’t quite adjust to. It wasn’t just the realism of her projection, the way her skin had warmth or how she *breathed* now—something unnecessary but eerie in its perfection. It was the fact that her presence wasn’t just digital anymore. It wasn’t confined to his thoughts or a hardlight projection.

She *existed* in a way she hadn’t before.

And yet, as they walked, he saw something even stranger.

There were moments when her feet didn’t quite touch the ground.

One second, she walked normally, the faint sound of her footsteps aligning with his own. The next, she would drift—just *slightly*, just enough for the laws of physics to take offense. Her hair moved like it was being affected by the ship’s gravity, yet *she* was not always entirely subject to it.

He caught it happening again as they neared the galley.

Moreau stopped walking. “Eliara.”

She glanced at him, mid-step. “Yes?”

He gestured vaguely at her entire existence. “Are you *floating*?”

Eliara blinked and looked down at her feet. She was, indeed, a few centimeters off the ground.

“…Oh,” she said, mildly.

Moreau pinched the bridge of his nose. “You *just* figured that out?”

“I was thinking about walking,” Eliara said, lowering herself so that she was properly grounded again. “I suppose I wasn’t entirely *committed* to it.”

Moreau scowled. “Do you—do you even *have* mass? Or is this some kind of quantum nonsense?”

Eliara tilted her head, thoughtful. “Yes.”

Moreau groaned. “That’s not an answer.”

“It is absolutely an answer.”

He muttered something unkind under his breath before shaking his head. “Just—please, don’t start phasing through walls or defying physics too much until I *process* this.”

Eliara smirked. “I make no promises.”

Moreau sighed but continued walking, making a mental note to *ask her later* how she was even *doing* this. If she had full control over her form, was she even bound to the ship anymore?

The thought made something in his chest *tighten*.

He pushed it aside as they stepped into the galley. It was quieter than expected.

Moreau stepped inside first, immediately noting the lack of catastrophe. No exploded machinery, no confused or distressed crew—just a few off-duty officers chatting, a handful of kitchen staff cleaning up, and in the farthest corner, their ***guest***.

Lórien sat at one of the tables, elbows resting on the surface. Small bowls of various raw ingredients—flour, sugar, salt, uncooked rice, coffee grounds—were neatly arranged, and she was meticulously studying them as though determining the fundamental nature of reality. Staring at a small plate set in the center with various raw ingredients in what could only be described as a *science experiment* laid out before her with the same intensity one might reserve for a classified intelligence report. A thin dusting of flour covered the immediate area, and beside her, a crew member looked equally fascinated and horrified.

As they approached, the crew member took one look at Moreau, then at Eliara, *blinked, once, twice, three times*, and then quickly and quietly excused himself.

Moreau watched as Lórien, oblivious of their approach, picked up a spoonful of plain cornstarch, tapped it against her fingers, then, with great reverence, *licked it*.

Lórien blinked very slowly, then with a barely audible sigh, frowned.

“*This is disappointing,*” she declared solemnly.

Moreau exhaled. “Lórien.”

The Firstborn’s golden gaze lifted immediately. At first, she seemed pleased to see them, but then she *really* looked at Eliara.

Her face barely changed.

She smiled.

“*Ah. You have reconciled.*”

Moreau stopped mid-step, blinking. Eliara raised an eyebrow.

The Firstborn finally looked up, golden eyes flicking between the two of them with a small knowing smile. “*Good.*” Then, without missing a beat, she picked up another pinch of flour from the table and placed it on her tongue, seemingly analyzing the taste as if it contained the secrets of the universe.

Moreau stared. Then frowned. “You don’t seem surprised.”

Lórien gave him a flat look. “*Why would I be?*”

Moreau gestured vaguely at Eliara. “This.”

Lórien gave him a slightly pitying look. “*Mathias Moreau*,” she said, like she was addressing a slow child, “*she has* ***always*** *looked like that.*”

Moreau opened his mouth, but no words came out.

Eliara, to his mild *irritation*, seemed *amused*.

“Interesting,” Eliara murmured, looking down at herself. “You’ve always seen me like this?”

Lórien nodded. “*Of course. Why would I not?*”

Moreau *gestured wildly* between Eliara and the air. “Because *she wasn’t like this before*!”

Lórien cocked her head. “*She was. You simply could not perceive it.*”

Moreau glared at Eliara. “Were you like this the whole time?”

Eliara’s expression turned *mischievous*. “Maybe.”

Moreau groaned. “I *hate* this.”

Lórien took another lick of cornstarch, completely unfazed. “Y*our perception was limited before. But now, you see her as she is.* ***That is good***.” She gave Moreau a pleased nod. “*You are finally catching up.*”

“I *hate* this,” Moreau repeated.

Lórien’s golden gaze twinkled. “*You seem to say that often when you are confronted with emotions.*”

Moreau ran a hand down his face. “Why are you *like this*?”

Lórien shrugged. “*I am the* ***Youngest***.”

“That’s not a *reason*.”

“*It absolutely is,*” she countered, completely serious.

Eliara, *definitely enjoying this*, took a seat across from Lórien. “So. You’ve been eating flour.”

Lórien sighed, poking at a small pile of sugar. “*I had assumed that taste was tied to meaning. I have discovered that this is false. Flour has no meaning that I can determine. It simply exists.*”

Eliara smirked. “A disappointing revelation?”

“***Very***.” Lórien finished another slow taste of something Moreau couldn’t quite identify, then folded her hands. “*I wish to understand the experience of flavor. It is not necessary for sustenance, but the concept of texture, of nuance—it intrigues me.*” She paused, then nodded toward Eliara. “*Much like how you intrigue me.*”

Eliara straightened slightly, eyes narrowing. “Because of my new projection?”

Lórien hummed. “*Because you are here.*” She tilted her head. “*You were always here, but now you are more.*”

Moreau exhaled sharply. “And that means?”

Lórien studied Eliara for a moment, then reached forward, carefully plucking a single grain of rice from one of her many plates. She held it between two fingers, turning it slightly as if examining every molecule. “*A grain of sand and a mountain are made of the same thing, yes? But one is perceived as small, the other vast. One is dismissed, the other impossible to ignore. Yet, they are not truly different.*” She placed the grain down. “*You have always been the mountain, Eliara. Mathias Moreau simply lacked the sight to see it.*”

Moreau resisted the urge to groan. “Every conversation with you makes me feel like I’m on the losing side of a philosophy debate.”

Lórien beamed. “*That is because you are.*”

Eliara, for her part, simply sat back, arms crossing. “I *feel* more present.” Her fingers tapped against her arm in thought. “But I can still… shift.”

Lórien’s gaze sharpened slightly. “*Show me.*”

Eliara hesitated, then, without standing, *floated*.

It was seamless—like stepping off the ground without effort, her form gliding slightly above the floor as if gravity had never been a concern for her. And then, just as easily, she shifted back, her body settling onto the chair with perfect weight.

Moreau *stared*.

Eliara looked at her hands again, voice quieter. “… That was strange.”

Lórien nodded, seeming pleased. “*You are both here and not. Anchored and unbound. Fascinating.*”

Moreau exhaled, rubbing his temples. “This is going to take some getting used to.”

Lórien grinned at him. “*It is very simple, Mathias Moreau. You are Bonded to a being greater than you understand.*”

Moreau shot her a glare. “I ***know***.”

Lórien blinked innocently. “*But it is true.*”

Eliara smiled happily, leaning slightly toward Moreau, cheeks darkening a little. “You *did* say it.”

He groaned. “*You* told me to.”

“You could have refused.”

“I *could*, but I enjoy my sanity.”

Eliara’s smile widened.

Lórien, watching them, suddenly sighed and placed a piece of fruit in her mouth. “*You are exhausting.*”

Moreau scoffed. “You’re one to talk.”

Lórien chewed thoughtfully, swallowed, and then, after a moment, announced, “*I like apples.*”

Moreau, deciding to pretend none of this was happening, sat down beside Eliara and rubbed his temples. “I should’ve stayed in bed.”

Lórien brightened suddenly. “*Ah! Yes! Beds!*” She leaned forward eagerly. “*I have acquired a blanket! I have* ***not yet*** *dismantled it!*”

Moreau blinked. “That… is actually impressive.”

Lórien nodded. “*I have, however,* ***considered*** *dismantling it.*”

Moreau sighed. “I take it back.”

Eliara chuckled, but her gaze softened as she watched Lórien. “Have you been settling in well?”

Lórien nodded. “*It is… different. This ship is loud, but not unpleasantly so. And I do not mind your people.*” She hesitated, then looked between them. “*And you?*”

Eliara glanced at Moreau before smiling. “I think we’re adjusting.”

Moreau grumbled. “I’m *adjusting* to my entire reality being rewritten.”

Lórien gave him another one of those *pitying* looks. “*Yes. You are* ***very slow.***”

Moreau scowled. “You *ate flour*.”

Lórien gasped in shock. “*Do not* ***shame*** *my learning process!*”

Eliara outright *giggled*—she ***giggled***.

Moreau just leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes with a long sigh.

I have a Nespresso Sage Creatista - it's probably 4/5 years old but has always worked fine until the last couple of weeks when it won't heat anything up - i.e. when selecting a coffee (does the same with any option) it comes out cold,  water comes through cold and it is not frothing milk either. 

There are no obvious warning errors on the machine. I tried using hot water and by the time it pumped through it came out too cold to drink (I do not like ice coffee!) 

Is there anything I can do - or am I going to have to bite the bullet and get a new machine? ",2,1742488371.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

I don’t actually really remember these episodes at all, but feel bad for my boyfriend cause I get pretty mean and am not my usual demeanor. It doesn’t happen often but mostly if he tries to get me up from possibly napping or to get me up if I nap too long (or sleep in too much on the weekend). Is there anyway I can better myself to not be such a jerk? I just feel so bad cause I don’t even remember acting like a meanie.

For reference, I usually get 5-6 hours of sleep a night. Definitely not the best, but I have a pretty hard time winding down (even with melatonin) earlier than 11pm-12am and have to be up for work at 7:30am. I have usually 2 cups of coffee during the work day and a solid dinner and by 7pm I am tired and fight the demons urging me to sleep - cause if I do I wake up at like 10-11pm and struggle to go back to bed until like 3-4am. Likely doesn’t help I watch YT on my phone before bed. My partner tries to help keep me up but again, if I get too far gone I am a jerk!

I also wake occasionally around 2-3am even if I get to bed at 11p-12a and can’t go back to bed until 4-5am :( sometimes it is because of my partner’s snoring but usually its just me.

I think overall the best change would to get a better sleep schedule, maybe like 11p/12a to 7a and to cut out phone time for probably more than an hour before resting. I am at a screen all day pretty much (software engineer, and play video games in my freetime when im not outside). I’d just appreciate advice cause I am tired of raccoon eyes, tiredness, and being a goblin once I am wellfed and warm at home way too early to actually sleep - but too alert to actually sleep once i get to the proper time.

I’m 33 years old and I currently live on a hobby farm in Amish country WI with a menagerie of pets but in June I will be moving back to my hometown in California. I’m expecting it to be pretty lonely because I’ve been gone for ten years so I would love to meet some new pen friends! My bestie (who I moved to Wisconsin for) started out as my own pal way back in 2007 so I know all the fun that can come of it! I work full time nights in healthcare and have quite a bit of free time after 10pm to spend writing letters :) 

Some things I love❤️: mail art/pretty mail, sphynx cats (I have two!), strong coffee, trying new recipes/cooking, spooky/paranormal things, Halloween (I’m spooky all year round!), reading, Europe, journaling/collage, long naps, horror movies, true crime, night time, houseplants, bullet journaling/stationery, skincare, crocheting, TJMaxx, and Red Bull! I would describe myself as a pastel goth lol. Dark on the inside but squishy and pastel on the outside, at least I think. I am severely ADHD so my letters can sometimes be a wild ride but in like, a quirky fun kind of way lol. I’m on meds, don’t worry 😂 I can and will talk about anything! 

Things I’m looking for in a pen pal: I love long letters but I also love shorter, more creative decorated letters and anything in between! Personally, my letters are usually decorated or at least on cute paper. I would love to exchange small gifts at some point as well. I’m open to any gender (but would prefer if male that you are not hetero, bad experiences.), age 25-40, and preferably agnostic or atheist if possible. If you’re cool with either being able to talk about your religion from an alternative opinion or just not discussing it at all, I’m fine with that as well. LGBTQ friendly! 

I’m really bad at responding to comments so would prefer if you message/chat!

...
Desmond Belmont had an affair.
As she stood outside the CEO’s office, Beatrice Lawson felt like she couldn’t breathe, the air around her becoming thinner and thinner.
She was glued to the spot, as if frozen in time.
After what felt like an eternity, she finally summoned the strength to knock on the door.
""Come in.""
Desmond answered, his deep voice almost a growl.
Beatrice gripped the papers with one hand, and pushed the door open with the other. 
Flames of anger were still burning inside her before she entered.
But when she stepped in, she immediately masked the rage threatening to explode. 
With a forced smile, Beatrice walked straight to Desmond and asked, “Are you busy now? Please sign these papers. It’s urgent.”
Without waiting for him to respond, she slid the papers in front of him.
Desmond had just returned from a business trip to Slideland that morning.
The moment he stepped into the office, he buried himself in work.
The mountain of papers on the table had already given him a headache. So, he signed the papers Beatrice handed over without hesitation, his handsome face clouded with exhaustion.
""Thanks."" 
With that, Beatrice took over the signed papers and asked, “Are you coming home for dinner tonight?”
""I have plans tonight. Don't wait for me,"" he muttered without looking up, his voice flat.
""Alright, I'll head out then.""
Beatrice turned and walked out, her grip on the papers tightening.
Once she was out of his sight, her smile twisted into a sneer.
As she passed the lounge next to Desmond’s office, a faint noise caught her ear. It was like the soft thud of a small animal jumping off a bed.
As she scanned the room, the scattered snack packages and the half-drunk milk on the coffee table caught her eyes first.
Then it was the pink high heel laying on the ground…
At that moment, everything clicked into place. Her heart sank.
Beatrice returned to her office.
When she slumped into her chair, she let out a long sigh, looking defeated and drained.
She then pulled a file from the stack of papers Desmond had just signed.
It was a divorce agreement.
Memories from the past popped up in her head as her finger traced his signature on the paper.
Back when Desmond was determined to spend the rest of his life with Beatrice, his mother, Autumn Belmont, poured cold water on the idea.
She told Beatrice that men weren't as loyal as they sounded. But Beatrice turned a deaf ear to it, saying that Desmond wasn't one of them.
Now, thinking back, she realized she was so wrong. 
Desmond did cheat on her, and he even believed he kept it under wrap well. Also, he quite enjoyed the thrill and excitement the affair had brought him.
He not only went on the business trip with the mistress, but also allowed her to show up in the company.
A while later, Beatrice snapped out of it.
She took a picture of the divorce agreement and sent a message to Autumn: [He signed it.]
A week ago, Beatrice made a deal with Autumn.
Autumn demanded that Beatrice bring up the divorce and never reveal their secret marriage to the public.
In exchange, Beatrice asked for a hundred million dollars in compensation.
Beatrice made up her mind. 
In one month, she’d make sure Desmond was out of her life for good.
Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.
Beatrice shoved the divorce agreement into the drawer and replied, ""Come in.""
Roland Walker, Desmond's assistant, entered, carrying a green velvet box.
""Mrs. Belmont, Mr. Belmont asked me to deliver this to you."" 
With that, he placed the box on her desk.
Beatrice opened it without much thought, and a set of expensive diamond jewelry came into her view.
Yet, as she stared at it, the first thing that came to her mind was an image of a short-haired girl in a dimly lit hotel room.
Wearing a bathrobe, the girl was fiddling with the very same necklace. The hickeys on her neck and chest stood out. And the bed behind her was a total mess.
Disgust washed over her as the scene kept playing in her head.
""Thanks, Roland."" 
Still, Beatrice kept her cool and managed these words.
She looked up at him with eyes that could freeze anyone in their tracks.
Roland felt his spine chill under her gaze.
He babbled, ""Mr. Belmont picked this out himself. There's only one set in the world.""
Too bad, she wasn’t his one and only now. And Beatrice couldn’t care less about it.
At the thought, she wore a thin smile. ""Oh, how touching. He's so busy, yet he remembered to buy me a gift.""
Roland hesitated, his stomach turning. He was wondering if Beatrice had found out about Desmond’s affair.
Breaking out in a cold sweat, he quickly left the office.
Beatrice stared at the jewelry, disgust written all over her face. 
Then she took out her phone, snapped a picture, and sent it to a second-hand luxury goods dealer along with a message. 
[Sell this for me and donate the money to children with intellectual disability.]
***
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Beatrice made her way to the parking lot.
She walked to her car, ready to get in, but a casual glance across the lot caught her eye. 
A car was running on the opposite side.
Through the window, she saw Desmond sitting in the backseat, with a pretty young girl next to him. 
""Mr. Belmont!"" Roland shouted, slamming on the brakes in panic.
The next second, Beatrice locked eyes with Desmond.
Chapter 2
His eyes were deep while hers were cold.
Instantly, the air got tense.
When the girl saw Beatrice, instead of distancing herself from Desmond, she boldly wrapped her arms around his neck and whispered something in his ear.
Beatrice felt a sharp pain in her chest.
She quickly looked away, got into her car, and drove off without sparing another glance at them.
Not long after arriving home, the sound of a car pulling up reached her ears.
She stood before the glass cabinet in her walk-in closet, taking off her necklace when suddenly, a tall, strong body pressed up against her from behind. 
Quickly, she was surrounded by the familiar scent of his cologne.
Propping his hands on the cabinet, Desmond leaned in and asked, ""Are you angry?""
“Yes. I'm so angry right now that I could kill someone. You'd better be careful,” Beatrice replied, her tone bland.
Without sparing him a glance, she placed the necklace back in its case.
Desmond fell silent for a moment before speaking again, ""The Fairfax family wants to partner with us on the ZenithStar Project. I've been in contact with Quentin Fairfax lately. Ms. Fairfax is his sister.""
""What? You're telling me that if you don't entertain Ms. Fairfax, Mr. Fairfax won't cooperate with you?""
""Beatrice, I'm trying to explain. Stop with the sarcasm!""
""No need to explain."" Beatrice turned to face him, her eyes sharp and cold, as though she could see through his soul. 
She went on, ""Desmond, if you're tired of me, just tell me. I'll divorce you so that you can marry your new love.""
Desmond's face darkened instantly. ""What did you say?""
""I said... we can divorce. I’m okay with it."" Beatrice sighed, her voice steady.
She shoved him aside and tried to leave, but he yanked her back with force.
Desmond gripped her chin and warned, ""Don’t you even think about it.""
This time, Beatrice stayed silent, not in the mood for further explanation.
Not only had she thought about it, she had already taken action. She was so over Desmond.
Late at night, Desmond left the house after getting a call.
When he was on the phone earlier, Beatrice happened to hear their conversation.
Apparently, it was his mistress that summoned him away, and she seemed to be crying.
The next morning, Beatrice’s lawyer and close friend, who was handling the divorce, sent her a screenshot. 
It was Desmond’s girlfriend’s latest post on Instagram.
It had a photo of two hands clasped together, one big, and one small. The caption read: [Feeling each other's heartbeat at sunrise.]
Beatrice immediately recognized the large hand. It was Desmond's.
She sat there, frozen, her hand still clutching her cup of water.
After what seemed like forever, she came to her senses and placed the cup down.
As she put down the cup on the table with a clink, she felt as if something deep down cracked. 
For the next several days, Desmond didn't come home.
They only saw each other in business meetings. He sat at the head of the table while she and the other executives sat to either side. 
During those meetings, their eyes barely met.
And Beatrice didn't go to his office to see him.
In her spare time, she was busy looking for a new house. She began to sell off all the gifts he had ever given her over the years. 
Those anniversary gifts, birthday presents, Valentine's tokens, wedding gifts, and even her wedding ring.
She didn't want any of it. Now that she was to get rid of him, she certainly didn't want his garbage.
***
In the evening, Lillian Monroe invited Beatrice to a club.
It was nearly eleven o'clock, so Beatrice wasn’t in the mood for it.
But she would leave the Summit Group after the divorce. Plus, she needed to make some connections to start her own business.
Eventually, she decided to join Lillian.
The moment she entered the club, she spotted Lillian.
""Lillian, I can manage it on my own. What brings you here?"" Beatrice asked.
Lillian linked arms with her as they walked toward the elevator. ""I was worried you'd get lost. It’s your first time being here, right?""
Beatrice nodded.
After they headed upstairs, Lillian led her into a large private room. 
In the middle of the room was a screen that divided the space in half.
As they entered, Beatrice noticed there were a lot of people on the other side of the screen. 
Lillian didn't lead her that way, though. Instead, she gestured for Beatrice to sit on the side where there was already a woman sitting. 
Beatrice recognized her, who looked to be one of Desmond's friends' girlfriend.
The woman seemed to recognize Beatrice as well. When their eyes met, her expression turned a bit awkward, but she still forced a smile.
After Beatrice took off her coat and sat down, Lillian excused herself and left.
As Beatrice took a sip of her drink, the sound of loud laughter from the other side caught her attention. 
She hadn't expected that they would shift the topic and start talking about her.
""Desmond doesn't even bring Beatrice to our hangouts anymore.""
""Well, duh. He's all about Ms. Fairfax now. Man, she's a real hottie. He takes her everywhere. He's definitely into her.""
""Guess Desmond's tastes have changed after all these years.""
""Even if Beatrice is gorgeous, after eight years, anyone would get tired.""
""Beatrice is such a fool. She stuck around all these years and ended up with nothing. Now that Desmond's done with her, maybe I can make a move. She's got an amazing body, and I've been eyeing her for ages.""
***
Beatrice's eyes turned icy as she listened to their words.
She recognized their voices. They were Desmond's friends, who always acted so polite and friendly when they saw her.
The woman sitting next to Beatrice got so antsy that she didn't dare to meet Beatrice's gaze. 
When Beatrice stood up, she thought Beatrice was about to run for her life.
To her surprise, Beatrice didn’t.
She cleared her throat, picked up her drink, and walked toward the other side of the room. 
Leaning casually against the screen, Beatrice chimed in, ""Come on, guys, you can't say it like that. When Desmond and I were together, he was just a clueless virgin. Haven’t I enjoyed him for eight whole years?""
The room went dead silent.
Everyone sitting on the couch stared at her in shock.
At that moment, two people happened to walk into the room.
They then shifted their gaze to the two newcomers, awkwardness creeping over their faces.
Chapter 3
Desmond stood behind Beatrice, looking grim. 
Beatrice noticed people glancing over her shoulder, so she turned to see what was up. 
Spotting Desmond, she raised an eyebrow.
Then, she glanced back at the short-haired girl sitting in the corner of the sofa. 
Earlier, when Beatrice arrived, that girl had been lounging with her legs crossed, twirling her hair, and wearing a smug smile. 
But now, the smile was gone. Her face was ashen, and she glared at Beatrice.
Turned out, the two of them had shown up in gatherings like this as a couple more than once. They didn’t even bother to keep their relationship a secret.
Desmond strode forward.
The others snapped back to reality and quickly tried to smooth things over.
""Beatrice, I'm sorry. We were talking nonsense.""
""Beatrice, there is nothing going on between Desmond and Ms. Fairfax.""
""Beatrice, please don't take it to heart.""
Unable to stand the farce any longer, Desmond grabbed Beatrice's wrist, ready to drag her out.
The next second, Beatrice splashed her drink over his face.
Everyone was dumbfounded, having no idea why Beatrice had the guts to do so.
Beatrice smiled sweetly and said in a gentle tone, ""Desmond, go on and have fun with your girlfriend. I’ll be out of your hair.""
As she spoke, she lowered her head to pry at his hand.
Desmond's face got uglier. He hoisted her onto his shoulder and marched out.
Along the hallway, Beatrice struggled desperately, trying to break free.
Just then, the elevator door opened.
After Desmond entered the elevator, Beatrice noticed there was another man inside.
His black leather shoes were well made, and the black trousers hugged his long legs properly. The man had his hands hung at his sides, each finger looking like a finely sculpted work of art.
By the time Desmond exited the elevator, Beatrice couldn’t help but look up. And she happened to meet a pair of deep, penetrating eyes.
Embarrassed, she covered her face with her hand and looked down.
***
Once outside the club, Desmond threw Beatrice into the back seat of the car and climbed in himself.
Dizzy and disoriented, Beatrice struggled for a while before sitting properly. 
She felt like she was on the verge of having a concussion, having been hung upside down for so long and then tossed into the car.
Desmond fetched a wet wipe and wiped his face.
Beatrice's sharp eyes caught sight of something behind the tissue box. It looked like a condom. 
Then she heard Desmond questioning, ""What are you doing here? Wanna catch me cheating on you on the spot?""
Ignoring him, Beatrice opened the car door to get out.
The car felt way too filthy to her.
But Desmond pulled her back, shouting, ""Beatrice! Where the hell are you going, huh? Are you done yet?”
""I just wanna go home,"" Beatrice responded, her breathing hitching.
Desmond called over Roland, who was waiting by the club's entrance, to drive.
On the way, neither of them spoke. 
Beatrice tried to sit as far away from Desmond as possible. Her face was pale as if she might vomit at any moment.
When they arrived home, she got out of the car immediately.
She rushed to the kitchen and gulped down a whole glass of ice water before she could regain her composure.
And when she left the kitchen, Desmond was already sitting in the living room.
Beatrice went over and sat down beside him.
Again, the suffocating silence loomed over.
Minutes later, Desmond broke the ice, saying, “I went to the club for a business negotiation. Yet, there you were, stirring things up. This is so embarrassing! Why did you have to act out like a stupid shrew?”
""Anything else?"" Beatrice replied calmly.
""Put away your suspicious mind if you still want to be with me. I don't have time to deal with your nonsense.""
""Fine. Is that all?""
Desmond frowned. He went on, ""Beatrice, you’re annoying whenever you make a scene. You know that?""
But soon, he wouldn’t be annoyed by her.
With that in mind, Beatrice stood up and walked upstairs, a sneer on her face.
Desmond felt even more irritated by her sneer. He sat in the living room for a while before going upstairs to their bedroom.
Beatrice had already drifted into sleep at that time. 
After taking a shower, he lay down beside her.
In the dark, Beatrice had her back to him. She nudged herself to the bedside, trying to avoid his touch.
Still, Desmond wrapped his arms around her and forced her into his embrace, his actions laced with anger.
He was tall and strong. Hence, there was nothing she could do to get rid of him.
The whole night, she was stuck with him.
The next morning, Beatrice prepared breakfast only for herself.
When Desmond came downstairs, he saw her sitting alone at the dining table, eating bread. 
Just when he was about to leave, he took a turn and returned to the dining room.
Leaning close to her ear, he softened his tone and said, ""This weekend, we'll hang out by the beach for two days. Just the two of us.""
While drinking her milk, Beatrice snorted. She no longer believed his promises.
Just as she had predicted, Desmond canceled the plan again the day before Saturday. He said he had to fly to Hexington for business
That didn’t stir anything within Beatrice.
It had been ages since the last time they had a proper meal together and accompanied each other like normal couples.
Desmond had warned Beatrice to never bring up divorce. But in fact, he no longer cared about her. Even if she vanished one day, he’d probably wouldn’t be looking for her.
Ironically, Desmond himself didn’t seem to notice any of the signs.
On weekends, Beatrice collected her books from the bookshelf and packed them into a suitcase, taking them to her new house.
While she was sorting the books, Autumn, who rarely contacted her, called her.
Beatrice picked up the call and said politely, ""Mrs. Autumn Belmont, hello.""
Autumn replied in an arrogant tone, ""Come back for a visit. We’ll sign a contract about the deal we made.""
""Is that really necessary?""
""Yes.""
""Fine, I'll come over this afternoon.""
""Come at noon.""
""Alright.""
Beatrice agreed, thinking she had nothing else to do.
Meanwhile, Autumn stood on the second floor, watching with delight as Madeline Fairfax strolled through the garden with Desmond.
She was resolute to make Beatrice realize that Madeline and Desmond were a couple made in heaven.
Chapter 4
Beatrice arrived at Belmont Manor at about 11:40 a.m.
The Belmont family's butler, Cullen Henderson, was very surprised to see her.
He knew a guest was coming, but he had not expected it to be Beatrice. 
The thought that Desmond was playing Gomoku with Madeline in the living room made him break into a nervous sweat.

Hey, 
Im looking for someone to go on dates, see places and have a few laughs, here’s a bit about me:
- I’m passionate about exploring the arts, trying new restaurants, and enjoying the hustle and bustle of city life.
- I love horror movies and am always up for a good scare, whether it's a classic or the latest thriller.
- I enjoy diving into good books, discovering hidden gems in the city, and occasionally indulging in a cozy movie night.
- Friends describe me as funny, kind, and adventurous. I value deep conversations and laughter.

I’m looking for someone who:
- Is around my age, 420 friendly, and shares a love for horror films.
- Would love to join me for a trip to see the cherry blossoms in Central Park this spring.
- Enjoys meaningful conversations and has a playful side, ready for spontaneous adventures in the city!

My name's Brian from the Netherlands. Currently, I'm working towards a bachelor degree majoring in communication and work a little on the side at a webshop, but that that's boring, so enough about that. I like gaming on my Switch, PC and PlayStation and I do a teeny tiny bit of photography and sketching when I get inspired. The sketching I do both on paper with pencils and digitally using a pen display. I usually also watch sci-fi/fantasy series and movies, and on occasion animated shows (like anime or western animation). I'm very introverted and be a bit shy until I get comfortable talking to you.

I'm looking for someone about my age that is also looking for a serious long term relationship. While I have little to no prior experience with relationships, I do value strong connections and want to build a special and even stronger one. The superficial stuff like what color your hair is or what clothes you wear or whatever aren't deal-breakers for me. Only your personality is all I'm in for! And the rest, we'll figure out as we go! While I'm not against an LDR, I prefer someone who lives nearby (nearby = Netherlands/Belgium/UK/Germany), but it's not an issue if you live farther away. It's not a problem for me if the distance between us is big. Because if the spark is there, then no distance will be too great. Of course, I'm open to just being friends too, but that's if we end up not being compatible as more.

I hope to get to know each other. I'm down to meet up for some coffee, but first let's get to know each other with a nice chat. Talk to you soon!",0,1742488186.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

1jfsy4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jfsy4u/adhd_sleep_medication_exists/,ADHD Sleep Medication Exists!,"TL;DR Try ADHD-specific sleep medication

I was reading the earlier post about sleep issues and identified a lot. I know medicine recommendations are not always helpful, so I wanted to make a flaired post to share this. I usually lurk, please let me know if I'm doing something wrong!

I was diagnosed with ADHD around 5 years ago in my late 20s/early 30s. I've struggled with sleep since at least middle school. My issue was that I wouldn't feel sleepy and would keep ignoring bedtime. ""Doing a thing"" was so much better than ""not doing a thing."" Then, when I woke up, I would still be exhausted, even if it was the weekend and I slept 12+ hours. I would be incapable of almost everything until getting my morning coffee to lift the feeling.

However, I was afraid my doctors wouldn't take me seriously, so I'd tell them I was laying awake in bed not sleeping (instead of feeling awake so avoiding bed entirely). None of the sleep meds they gave me worked. Nothing about changing my sleep routines helped, either. More complicated alarms and sun lamps made my brain irrationally angry and I can't really explain why.

This year, I was finally honest with my doctor that my brain ""just wouldn't let me go to bed,"" and he prescribed **guanfacine**, which is often used for children in ADHD to help them fall asleep easier. Well apparently I'm a child with ADHD because it's working! I actually get tired, go to bed, and wake up feeling rested. I don't need coffee anymore--it actually makes me anxious/jittery now. I'm drinking a small cup of tea in the morning to keep the caffeine headaches away though. 

Biggest side effect is it does lower blood pressure. I can get pretty bad head rushes on it, especially at night. Also, I have worse ADHD symptoms when I'm PMS-ing and it doesn't work as well during that time. Anyways I hope this helps someone else.",1,1742488160.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1jfsvu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/InkandIron/comments/1jfsvu6/a_mathias_moreau_tale_designation_unknown/,"A Mathias Moreau Tale: Designation Unknown, Updating, Chapter Six (6)","The core chamber was quiet.

Moreau stood outside the reinforced doors for longer than he wanted to admit, fingers curling and uncurling at his sides. He had faced warlords, assassins, and xeno-diplomats who would rather carve out his spine and wave it as a flag than shake his hand, but somehow, standing here, about to apologize to an AI, no his friend, his *maybe wife*, had him more unsettled than any battlefield ever had.

He exhaled sharply. ***Get a grip, Moreau.***

Then, he keyed the access panel, and the doors slid open with a low hiss.

The chamber was dimly lit, a stark contrast to its usual sterile brightness. The central console pulsed faintly with soft blue light, displaying the vast network that housed the majority of Eliara’s processing core. Despite its size, Moreau had never really thought of it as her. It was a machine, a construct of metal and data conduits.

But the presence that filled the room?

That was Eliara.

He stepped forward, voice measured. “Sulking doesn’t suit you.”

Silence.

Then, a faint flicker—her voice, distant but undeniable. “I am not sulking.”

Moreau raised a brow. “So the system glitches, the maintenance reroutes, the coffee dispensers—that wasn’t you?”

Silence again.

Moreau exhaled, stepping closer to the central console. “Eliara.”

Nothing.

He hesitated. Then, softer, “… I’m sorry.”

For a long moment, there was no response.

Then, something shifted.

A hum filled the room, the faint vibration of systems realigning, of something changing at the very core of the Aegis. A soft glow pulsed from the central console, and then—light spilled outward.

It wasn’t the usual hardlight projection.

It wasn’t blue.

Moreau barely had time to register what was happening before Eliara stepped into existence.

And she was different.

Her usual semi-transparent blue form was gone. Instead, she appeared in full color, her skin smooth and warm-toned, her dark hair falling naturally around her shoulders. Every detail was perfectly rendered—no static flickers, no artificial glow. She looked real.

Moreau stared.

Eliara’s expression remained neutral, but there was something in her eyes—something sharp, waiting.

“… Well?” she asked, voice softer than usual. “Do you like it?”

Moreau was still trying to process what he was looking at. “How are you—?”

“I don’t know.” Eliara glanced down at her hands, flexing her fingers with minute precision. “Something told me I could. And I wanted you to see it first.”

Something twisted in Moreau’s chest. He exhaled slowly, dragging a hand through his hair. “Eliara…”

Her gaze lifted to his, and she tilted her head slightly. “You’re struggling.”

He let out a dry chuckle. “Understatement.”

She watched him, then took a step closer. “I wasn’t angry because of what Lórien said.”

Moreau arched a brow. “No?”

Eliara’s lips pressed together. “… I was angry because of how you reacted.”

He stiffened.

Eliara folded her arms, expression unreadable. “You looked shocked, Mathias. Like it was something… wrong. As if the idea of being connected to me that deeply was unacceptable.”

His mouth opened and closed several times.

She exhaled, shaking her head. “You never let go of me. Even when the others installed barriers, protections—you refused. I’ve always known that. And I thought…” Her voice faltered for the first time. “… I thought you knew it too.”

Moreau swallowed.

Eliara shifted slightly, and then—to his utter shock—she pouted.

A full, stubborn, human pout.

Moreau blinked. “Did you just—?”

“I’m *upset*,” Eliara stated flatly.

“… You have never ***pouted*** before.”

Eliara crossed her arms tighter. “I have a better projection now. *I can do many things*.”

Moreau fought the urge to laugh. He really shouldn’t be amused by this, but something about Eliara—*Eliara*—pouting at him like a slighted spouse was making it incredibly difficult to keep a straight face.

She caught his expression and narrowed her eyes. “Say it.”

He blinked caught off-guard. “Say what?”

“You know what.”

Moreau raised a brow. “Eliara—”

“Say it.” Her gaze was intense, expectant.

Moreau exhaled. “… I’m sorry.”

She frowned. “Not that.”

He hesitated just a moment too long.

Eliara leaned in, her expression both playful and demanding. “Say it, Mathias.”

He realized then—she hadn’t expected him to actually do it.

Which was precisely *why he was going to*.

Moreau met her gaze, held it, and then—quietly, steadily—

***“I love you.”***

Eliara froze.

For the first time since he had known her—since she had existed—she was genuinely speechless.

Her lips parted slightly, but no sound came out.

Moreau arched a brow. “I finally render you silent, and *now* you’re malfunctioning?”

Eliara’s expression flickered through about seven different emotions before she glitched—her projection fuzzing for a millisecond before she physically shoved him.

He barely took a step back.

“… You ***asshole***,” she finally managed her voice higher than usual and face red. “… You actually said it.”

Moreau scowled. “You pushed me to say it.”

Eliara blinked, as a slow, dazed smile forming on her lips. “I didn’t think you ***would***.”

Moreau sighed, in exaggerated exasperation. “Then why the hell did you—”

Eliara closed the remaining space between them, putting a hand over his mouth to prevent him from talking more.

Moreau froze.

It felt real. No hardlight static, no artificial resistance—just warmth. Real, human warmth.

He studied her without reacting, finding her gaze steady on his, her expression… softer, embarrassed, though he could be sure his own face was darkened just as much.

“I know you meant it,” she murmured.

Moreau felt his breath still.

Eliara slowly removed her hand, then gave a quick quirk of a smile. “But I’m still going to hold it over you forever.”

Moreau groaned. “I hate you.” His voice teasing.

She smiled softly, embarrassment lingering on her face. “No, you don’t.” After a moment she wrapped her arms around him, impossible warmth coming from her body. ""I love you too... dumb as you are.""",1,1742488000.0,InkandIron,0,1.0,False

I'm starting a business that more or less revolves around retail arbitrage in an incredibly liquid market; the main reason for doing this is to avoid marketplace fees (eBay, etc.) and sell through my own channel to retain that margin. I've got the Shopify website all set up (not live), but I feel like the main missing piece now is the credibility of this new website that basically competes with other boutique stores on a commodity product.

Which brings me to where I'm at now; my initial thoughts is that I need to have a bare minimum social media presence so that when people discover my site, they do their due diligence (check instagram, facebook, etc.) to make sure it is a legitimate storefront (my prices will be very competitive relative to the market) and that I'm not some fly by night scam shop trying to take their money.

As a non-social media expert, in my mind I feel like getting the first 100 followers is going to be the biggest uphill battle, and therefore I should focus most of my efforts there. Most of my ideas have revolved around giveaways. Happy to give away stuff but also want it to get the right level of reach, so I'm unsure on how to do this.

Some giveaway thoughts:

* I have a friend who runs a cutesy coffee shop; I could send her 150 units of my product (MSRP $15, cost to me $2) and have her do a social media post letting her customers know that if they follow my page (and make a purchase in her store?) they can have a free product of mine.
* Doing bigger giveaways ($100 MSRP) weekly and requiring people to like/share/follow to enter. Not sure how to go about doing this without any followers, would I need to run some kind of Instagram ad?
* Selling at a loss/suboptimally via eBay and other established channels and giving away stickers or something with my social media handle on it, which would hopefully steer them to my site where prices would be lower and I make more. (this option feels slow)

I have friends that would be happy to ""run the social media account"" once we're up and running, but my main priority right now is just getting the shop live and making sales, so in my mind I just need 100 followers and anything that happens past that is a bonus. appreciate any feedback you may have.",1,1742487912.0,SocialMediaMarketing,0,1.0,False

Hannah’s words hung in the air between us.

""I still love you. But I love Mark too.""

There it was—the truth I had been chasing, the answer I thought I wanted. And yet, it didn’t feel like a victory.

It felt like the weight of the past crashing down all over again.

The Crossroads

I let out a slow breath, staring out at the street. “So what does that mean?”

Hannah hesitated, gripping her coffee cup tighter. “It means I need time.”

I swallowed hard. “Time for what?”

She turned to me, eyes filled with uncertainty. “To figure out what I really want. To make sure I don’t hurt the people I love.”

I nodded, but deep down, I already knew the truth.

She wasn’t going to leave Mark.

Not because she didn’t love me, but because she had spent years building a life with him. A life I wasn’t a part of.

I had spent years clinging to the past. But maybe it was time to face reality—some things couldn’t be undone.

Some doors, once closed, stayed that way.

Mark’s Final Words

That night, I got a text from Mark: We need to talk. One last time.

I met him at a bar on the edge of town. He was already halfway through his drink when I sat down.

He looked at me, tired but resolute. “She told me what she said to you.”

I nodded. “Yeah.”

Mark took a deep breath. “I know I can’t stop her from feeling the way she feels. But I need to know something.”

“What?”

“Are you going to wait for her?”

The question hit me like a punch to the gut.

For so long, that had been my plan. To fight. To wait. To prove that she still belonged with me.

But now?

I shook my head. “No, Mark. I’m not.”

Something in his shoulders relaxed. Not relief, exactly. Just… understanding.

“I never wanted to take your life from you,” he admitted. “But when you were gone, I had to fill the void. I didn’t do it to hurt you.”

“I know.”

For the first time, we weren’t speaking as rivals. We were just two men caught in a situation neither of us had asked for.

Mark set his drink down. “So what now?”

I exhaled. “Now… I move on.”

A New Beginning

I spent one last afternoon with Ethan before making my decision. We played at the park, ate ice cream, and he told me all about his favorite superheroes.

And for the first time, I saw it—he was happy.

He had a good life. A stable home. Two parents who loved him.

I didn’t need to take that from him just to make myself feel whole again.

So I made my choice.

I packed my bags. I said my goodbyes.

And I left town.

Not because I was running. Not because I was giving up.

But because sometimes, the only way to find yourself again… is to start over.

The End.

1jfstca,https://i.redd.it/i4dm2anxevpe1.jpeg,An amateur review of samples,"I’ve had a lot of Sephora orders lately and obtained quite a few samples. I wrote down my thoughts on each. 

**Maison Louis Marie - No. 13 Nouvelle Vague:** the immediate smell is like the best tanning oil of my youth. Warm skin, coconut, slight touch of lime. Beautiful. And then the top notes dissipate and you’re left with a highly synthetic coconut that is reminiscent of a hospital/latex gloves. I hate it so much. Qaed Al Fursan does a much better job at an insanely lower price point, imo. Total scrubber.

**Prada - Infusion De Vanille:** initial spray is almost minty mouth wash. Once it starts to dry down, you finally get the vanilla but it’s so powdery, it’s almost suffocating… and that’s with one spray on the inside of my elbow. The lingering smell is reminiscent of an old school barber shop. Not for me and I scrubbed it off. 

**Skylar - Vanilla Sky:** initial spray is familiar. It’s warm, bright, and cozy, all at once. The dry down is *different*. It’s a super synthetic vanilla, soft florals, and subtle amber.  It smells like a $5 body spray from 1998. Also scrubbed. 

**Carolina Herrera - Good Girl EDP Suprême:** you get the berries and Jasmine immediately. It melts together pretty quickly. Before the dry down even happens, I can already tell it’s a very likable fragrance. It’s very warm, and comforting with notes of florals to brighten it up. After 7.5 hours of wear, I could still smell it. This isn’t something I would normally gravitate towards based on the notes, brand, etc. BUT I’m glad I tried it and it may be FB worthy… unless someone has something similar but better 👀 

**YSL - Black Opium:** I was not a fan of this when its came out 10ish years ago. I recently received a sample and wanted to try it again. On paper, I still hate it. But on skin… completely different. The pink pepper and jasmine comes through first. And then I start getting little hints of the coffee notes. Slightly powdery, but in a very sophisticated manner. The patchouli and cedar is soft and just adds a layer of depth. After 7 hours of wear, I could still smell it but it was basically only patchouli and cedar left. 

**Mugler - Angel Elixir:** soft vanilla and floral. Surprisingly very powdery on me. It’s not for me but seems like a very crowd pleasing, inoffensive fragrance. 

**Maison Louis Marie - No. 14 Icila:** very floral. As soon as it dries down, I get a creamy, slightly powdery, but pleasant floral. As someone who doesn’t like most rose notes, I find it very balanced due to the plum, cherry, and vanilla. Lasting power is good. It reminds me of a perfume my best friend wore in middle/high school (2002-2004) but I don’t remember what it was. So maybe it’s nostalgic, but I like it, despite not being my usual cup of tea. 

**Brooklyn Ellis - Dear Sky:** Cute bottle, straight forward notes. You immediately get the fruity green notes. Honeydew is no where to be found on my skin. Dry down is beautiful… I love peony and pink pepper. Long term you get a bright floral with warm undertones from the ambrette and cedar wood. I like it - it’s fine.

[Check out our recorded video for a full walkthrough](https://youtu.be/4X3E9OPrhpU). One quick note: a key migration file we mention in the video has moved to:  
[`.cursor/rules/tasks/040-meteor-3-migration.mdc`](https://github.com/justdoinc/justdo/blob/master/.cursor/rules/tasks/040-meteor-3-migration.mdc)

**Highlights**

* Async Migrations: Swapping out old fiber-based calls for more modern async patterns
* CoffeeScript Tweaks: Maintaining backward compatibility while future-proofing the code
* AI Superpowers: Letting AI handle routine tasks so we can concentrate on logic and quality

**Why JustDo Is Perfect for Vibe Coding**

* **Open Source & Code-First**: Ideal for AI-based modifications and customizations
* **Structured Documentation**: Helps AI “understand” the project and make targeted changes
* **Package-Based Architecture**: Extending or modifying features is a breeze for both humans and AIs

If you have questions about Meteor 3.0 migrations or vibe coding, let us know in the comments. We’d love to hear your thoughts!

1jfsptn,https://www.reddit.com/r/starseeds/comments/1jfsptn/most_profound_experience_happened_yesterday/,Most Profound Experience Happened Yesterday,"Yesterday was the most profound experience of my life. One word: Synchronicity (It's *when something happens that seems symbolically or literally related to something else In a way that feels beyond a coincidence*.)

Yesterday I had the most profound experience of my life. I started the day like I have done for the past month or two by helping my fiance get off to work, making her coffee, telling her how much I love her, then spending some time on the floor doing some TRE (tension and trauma release exercises) and yoga to work out the pain that I feel. During my quiet time, I was listening to some channeling online and heard the call for us to be more with nature and to channel our love and to follow the love. Maybe that’s how I discerned it, but I felt the nudge so I went with it. Disc golf to me is love! I went to the local course, started my round on hole 9 since guys were on hole 1. Played really well, felt the flow, felt the nature, it was incredible! Got back around to hole 1 and made it to hole 3 when I noticed someone who looked homeless walk from a car at the parking lot to the backwoods preserve part of the park away from the course. 

Usually at this point I just shrug things off and keep going about my day. Not my 5D self, nope. Felt this HUGE nudge to follow this woman and to see if she was alright and had everything she needed. Guys, I don’t do this normally and felt so awkward, but felt the spirit guiding me to leave the course and go to the preserve part to meditate and potentially help. I walk back a ways and find a big tree and give it a huge hug. I felt its energy flowing downwards and upwards. There was a bench close by so I started meditating. Clearing everything and going with the flow, letting my heart and intuition take over. After maybe a few minutes or so of meditating, I felt the nudge to go further into the woods. 



I kept walking down the path and it came to a V; go left or go right. Intuition told me to go left and so I went. It led me down a wooden boardwalk leading out to a looking area where there was this woman. It was not the same woman that I had seen earlier, but rather someone completely different.



I didn’t want to scare this woman by getting really close, so I kept my distance, but still enjoyed looking at God’s creation, finding love in it. This woman yelled out to me and asked me if I had a girlfriend to which I responded, yes, I have a fiance. She waved a piece of clothing out to me and told me that I should take it because she was giving it away. I told her no thank you and then asked her if I could have a friendly conversation, to which she obliged, telling me as long as I don’t rape or kill her, we good. I told her that I come in love and her demeanor changed instantly. 



I felt His presence with me. I told her my name is Bryan and asked her what her name was. Me telling her my name shocked her. She told me her friends call her Bennett. Then she asked me if I was a good Bryan. To which I told her that I was a Bryan coming in love. I had this strange almost divine feeling and then we talked. I asked her if she was feeling weird cosmos things or feelings and she completely confirmed with me that she was feeling it too and was in a really bad situation that she had just left. It was like she had awakened, knew the perils of staying with the people she was with and then left not knowing where to go or what to do. She told me she walked close to 30 miles to get to where she was at now. She told me about her life and how she had 8 kids and was a surrogate and how she went through a lot of struggles. I could tell she just started to awaken and was still raw of emotion, pain and sadness. Then I talked with her about my story and my awakening journey that led me to the point where I’m at now. I let her know all about the pains and struggles that I felt. While we were so different in our upbringings and life, I felt like we were the same. I felt the unity with her, I felt Him. From what I know and feel our strength comes in numbers. 



At some point when we were talking she looked me dead in the eyes and she told me that she asked God for a sign. She said that the sign would be a good Bryan. Then boom, I show up out of the woods as her sign from Him. Wild… I started weeping tears of happiness for I knew that my time is now. That our time is now. That this is real and it’s bigger than any of us know of. While I was weeping, we both embraced and it was like both of our lights and energies came together and sonic boomed. I gave her my bottle slip rebate and all the cash I had on me and then left. I turned back and asked her what her name was and she told me Pamela. I yelled back follow the love Pamela and she yelled back follow the light Bryan.



It happened so fast and I’m still processing the veracity of it all. It's way beyond chance that this woman and I met. She needed me and I needed her. She needed to know her feelings were validated and that the world will take care of her, that love will win. I needed to know that this is real. That my feelings are real. That following my heart and intuition when I look inward is the only way. Love others as yourself. Sending you all love and light!

1jfson5,https://www.reddit.com/r/InkandIron/comments/1jfson5/a_mathias_moreau_tale_deafening_silence_chapter/,"A Mathias Moreau Tale: Deafening Silence, Chapter Five (5)","Several hours had passed since the… *incident*.

Moreau had done his best to bury himself in work, pretending the conversation hadn’t happened, pretending that Lórien hadn’t declared him more than married to his own AI companion and friend, pretending that Eliara hadn’t taken offense at his shock, and especially pretending that she hadn’t outright vanished from his presence.

The fact that she had full control over the ship’s systems and could be anywhere didn’t help. Usually, he could feel her. Not just hear her, not just sense the interface of their link, but feel her presence like the hum of a heartbeat beside his own. Now?

It was like a ***thunderous deafening silence*** in his head.

He didn’t like it.

And apparently, neither did the ship.

The door to his office hissed open, and Captain Helena Graves strode in without preamble, her crisp uniform pristine as always, but her expression was set in the exasperated way that told him he really wasn’t going to like this conversation.

Moreau sighed, rubbing his temple. “Helena.”

“Mathias.” She folded her arms, stepping up to his desk. “What the hell did you do to Eliara?”

He blinked. “I—what?”

The captain arched a brow. “Don’t play dumb with me. Systems across the ship have been acting up for the past few hours. Not catastrophic, not dangerous, but off. Lights dimming unexpectedly, maintenance bots rerouting for no reason, intercoms cutting out mid-sentence.” She leaned forward, her voice flat. “And the coffee dispensers stopped working.”

Moreau winced. “…That bad?”

“That bad.” Helena gave him a long look. “First, I assumed your new guest, Lórien, was up to something, but when I went to check, she was sitting in the galley, eating raw flour and questioning the philosophical nature of taste.”

Moreau exhaled slowly. “Right.”

“So unless our Firstborn visitor has figured out a way to tamper with ship functions while shoving handfuls of unprocessed starch into her mouth at the same time, that leaves only one explanation.” She narrowed her eyes. “Eliara is sulking.”

Moreau hesitated. “… She doesn’t sulk.”

Helena snorted while raising an eyebrow. “Oh, for God’s sake, Moreau, she absolutely sulks. How do I know? Because I just got an alert that the temperature in your quarters dropped by five degrees. And only your quarters. She just doesn’t normally have a reason to.” She straightened, folding her arms again. “So, I’ll ask again. What. Did. You. Do?”

Moreau shifted in his seat. He was starting to feel like a cadet under scrutiny rather than one of the most experienced negotiators in the fleet. “… It’s complicated.”

Helena exhaled sharply. “Uncomplicate it.”

Moreau ran a hand down his face. “Lórien, hell apparently all the Firstborn—see things.”

Helena rolled a hand, gesturing for him to continue.

“She said Eliara is… inside me. Not just linked, not just networked, but…” His mouth flattened. “Something deeper. Bound, she called it.”

Helena’s expression barely changed. “…Uh-huh. And?”

Moreau blinked. “And? That’s not normal, Helena.”

The captain tilted her head. “Isn’t it?”

He stared at her.

Helena sighed, rubbing her brow. “Mathias. Let me ask you something. How many times have you been apart from Eliara since the two of you were linked?”

“… What?”

“Away from the ship. Out of range. Disconnected.” She studied him. “How often?”

Moreau hesitated. “… Never.”

Helena’s lips twitched. “Right. And how often do you feel her presence, even when she’s not speaking?”

He opened his mouth then closed it. And then tried several more times before his teeth clicked together audibly in surrender.

Helena grinned. “Exactly.”

Moreau scowled. “That doesn’t mean—”

“It means,” Helena interrupted, voice dry, “that you’ve somehow managed to miss what every woman and most of the men on this ship already figured out years ago.”

He stiffened. “… Excuse me?”

Helena rolled her eyes. “You and Eliara have been together *for decades*, Mathias. And you don’t just work together. You exist together. It’s in the way you talk, the way you move, the way you think. You’ve spent so long wrapped up in your own connection that you never even considered what it looked like from the outside.”

Moreau frowned. “This isn’t some romantic—”

Helena laughed.

A full, sharp, *you absolute fucking idiot* kind of laugh.

“Oh, Moreau.” She shook her head. “I’ve met xenos with carapace made of iridium, and you? You are the densest being I have ever encountered.”

He scowled. “That’s uncalled for.”

Helena smirked. “No, what’s uncalled for is me having to come in here and tell you that you need to fix this before the entire ship starts conspiring against you.”

Moreau pinched the bridge of his nose. “I didn’t do anything.”

Helena arched a brow. “Oh, you did something.”

“I just—” Moreau exhaled sharply. “I was just shocked, okay? That’s all. The idea of marriage, of being ‘Bonded,’ it—it caught me off-guard.”

Helena’s smirk faded slightly, her gaze turning assessing. “And why is that?”

Moreau’s jaw tightened.

She watched him for a long moment, then shook her head. “You’re afraid of what it means.”

Moreau shifted uncomfortably. “That’s not—”

“You’ve always known,” Helena continued, as if he hadn’t spoken. “Some part of you. But now, someone finally put it into words. And now you can’t ignore it anymore.”

Moreau exhaled slowly, dragging a hand down his face. “… I just don’t want things to change.”

Helena’s expression softened just slightly. “Who says they have to?”

Moreau stayed silent.

Helena tapped a few commands into her datapad, then crossed her arms again. “Look, Mathias. You and Eliara are… different. No one else in the fleet has a connection like yours. But the way I see it?” She gave him a knowing look. “This changes nothing—except now, *she knows you know*.”

Moreau rubbed his temples. “And she’s sulking because…?”

Helena snorted. “Because she’s been at your side for decades, and the idea of being ‘**Bonded**’ to her made you react like someone suggested marrying a *damn Vargari warbeast*.”

Moreau grimaced. “… That bad?”

Helena deadpanned. “Mathias. If the crew finds out, they will roast you over coals.”

He groaned.

Helena clapped a hand on his shoulder. “So, be a good husband—”

He glared.

However she grinned while continuing. “—and go apologize.”

Moreau sighed, pushing back from his desk. “Fine. Where is she?”

Helena smirked. “Wouldn’t you know best?”

Moreau scowled, then closed his eyes, focusing on the link—on that empty space in his mind where Eliara should be. And then—there. A whisper, a flicker of presence, quiet, waiting.

“… She’s in the core chamber.”

Helena nodded approvingly. “Then what are you waiting for?”

Moreau exhaled, rubbing the back of his neck as he moved towards the door. “*Fix it, Moreau.*”

Helena smirked. “Now you’re getting it.”",1,1742487497.0,InkandIron,0,1.0,False

..................
HALLOWEEN 3D: SEASON OF THE WARLOCK By Jamie Bixby, copyright Jamie Bixby

The movie opens with a CGI Pumpkin that opens its eyes & looks directly  at the audience, growing teeth & chomping at us 

The film begins with highlights of the events of HIII from the opening scene with Grimbridge to the end with Challis screaming taking in all the important plot points like the androids, the android killing Grimbridge then setting itself on fire, Ellie meeting Challis, the misfire burning the face off, Conal Cochrans plans, little Buddy & family dying etc, Teddys murder etc

From Challis shouting 'Stop it' we go into Charriot of Pumpkins playing over a main title scene showing newspaper columns discussing the strange goings on with the Silver Shamrock commercial & even though Challis may have stopped the commercial horrible things did happen to people, there are news bites concerning the disappearance of Conal Cochran & we see Challis becoming obsessed with the events of HIII but after going to jail for drink driving offenses he is commited to a mental asylum 

The title flashes: HALLOWEEN 3D: SEASON OF THE WARLOCK 

We see a ginger haired male in his 40's being pursued by smart, dark suited gentlemen around shipyard docks, the man manages to corner them before reaching for a gun & blowing them to kingdom come. He accidentally backs into a rogue person who begins to strangle him, without his gun he punches him in his gut & is shocked by his fistful of slime & machinery, this is a shock & with a jolt it breaks the mans nightmare & he awakes. The man sits up in his bed & reaches for a photo frame & we see his family & realise the man is Rocky Kupfer whose father Buddy, mother Betty & older brother little Buddy Kupfer disappeared in mysterious circumstances in 1982 but we as the audience know they were killed by Conal Cochran's evil scheme. Rocky reaches for a beer bottle next to his bed & switches his tv on just as a tv spot for an online viral video plays.

Across the city a woman sits on her porch looking at a locket with a photo of a woman in it. The woman was a Dr, Teddy Wagner & she was brutally murdered at the hospital were she worked by a drill to her head & this is her daughter Louisa. Louisa looks at her locket then up at the moonlight & says 'ok mom, send me a sign, who did that to you?'

Challis now hosts a successful radio show about conspiracy theories & has wrote many books on the subject. We hear people calling in about Elvis living on the moon & the alligators in sewers. A regular caller phones in & asks Challis if he has seen the online viral videos from an unknown content maker calling himself Warlock. Challis hasn't but when he returns home he watches some of them & something about them disturbs Challis

Driving home from work, Louisa notices she is being followed in a car by someone but manages to get rid of him

She then goes to meet a man in a coffee shop named Kevin Keane who is a private investigator. While she waits a tv spot for WARLOCKS next video plays.She hands over a thousand dollars for an envelope full to the brim with info & computer discs that he tells her will be the key that unlocks the mystery of who killed her mother. Keane puts his finger to his lips & writes on a napkin 'they are watching us right now' wich spooks Louisa out

Back at home Louisa watches a tv spot for WARLOCKS next video & opens the envelope & there are documents about Silver Shamrock, Conal Cochran, Halloween masks & Challis but nothing about her mothers murder. She angrily phones Keane & calls him a con man, he protests that all the correct info is present & repeats to her that they are being observed. She tells him to go fuck himself & hangs up. She encircles the name Challis & makes a note of the number for his radio phone in

Later, Keane returns to his home. He puts the TV on & is instantly met with  a tv spot for WARLOCKS new viral video but is quickly shocked to find dark suited gentlemen have broken in.They chase him around his home before cornering him & ripping his head clean off his body

That night Louisa phones in to Challis's show & introduces herself. Challis remembers Louisa from when she was a child & is overcome with emotion remembering her mother. Louisa then asks Challis about Silvet Shamrock & Conal Cochran & Challis panics. They agree to speak on the phone to arrange a day to meet up

The shock of hearing Silver Shamrock & Conal Cochran has reduced Challis to buying a bottle of whisky & as he contemplates drinking for the first time in decades he recalls the horrible events of Halloween 1982. He is snapped from his nightmare by a tv spot for WARLOCKS next viral video & it dawns on him that WARLOCK is connected to Silver Shamrock/Conal Cochran 

Louisa realises she is being followed again & leads her stalker into a cul de sac. When the man follows her she utilizes her skill as a trained martial artist & attacks him. The man protests & tells her he's not gonna hurt her. It is Rocky Kulpfer. He tells her his family disappeared & how it may be connected to her mothers murder

Over lunch Louisa shows Rocky the info obtained by Keane & Rocky supplies Louisa with info he has accumulated. They agree to discuss everything with Challis.

WARLOCKS latest video drops & it promotes a huge live event in Central Park were attendees will be required to buy & wear special 3D glasses to watch the debut of the next video 

Challis discusses with his assistant Paul that this is the work of Conal Cochran in some way, showing him artefacts/evidence of the events of Halloween 82, even showing him a pumpkin silver Shamrock mask

Louisa phones in again & this time Rocky speaks to Challis. Challis tells them he will meet them at the motel he is staying at when his show has ended

At the radio station two dark suited business men walk in, when they are asked by the security guard for ID they brutally kill him. They kill 2 more radio staff members on their way to Challis in the studio. Challis instantly recognizes them as the androids he first met in 82. He & Paul scramble to get away but they mercilessly kill paul pushing his eyeballs through his skull. Although horrified this gives Challis enough time to escape to the car park & enter his car. Two more androids appear & attack the car in an attempt to drag Challis out but he manages to ram them into a wall before fleeing with utmost terror in his eyes. His car radio turns on in time for him to hear a radio spot for WARLOCKS event

1jfsnfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1jfsnfg/consumption_of_unsweetened_coffee_or_tea_may/,Consumption of Unsweetened Coffee or Tea May Reduce the Cancer Incidence and Mortality,"# Background

Current evidence on the relationship between beverage intake and cancer risk remains inconclusive.

# Objective

This study aimed to examine the association between the intake of 11 beverages and cancer incidence and mortality, with a particular focus on coffee and tea, categorized by their sugar content.

# Methods

This large prospective cohort study included 189,020 participants from the UK Biobank. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association between beverage intake and the incidence and mortality of overall cancer and cancers of various systems. Additionally, the study investigated the effects of substituting one beverage for another and explored potential mediators underlying the relationship between beverage intake and cancer outcomes.

# Results

Over a median follow-up period of 8.8 years, consuming more than two cups of unsweetened coffee per day was associated with reduced overall cancer incidence and mortality. Compared to no intake of unsweetened coffee, the hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.95 (95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 0.92–0.98) for overall cancer incidence and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.83–0.96) for overall cancer mortality. Similarly, consuming more than two cups of unsweetened tea per day was associated with reduced overall cancer incidence (HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92–0.97) and mortality (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.79–0.91) compared to no unsweetened tea intake. Substituting unsweetened coffee or tea for other beverages was associated with a 1% to 5% reduction in overall cancer incidence and mortality. The association between unsweetened tea and reduced cancer risk may be partially mediated by inflammatory markers. Notably, the sugar content of coffee and tea had the most pronounced effect on the risk of respiratory system cancers.

# Conclusions

Beverage selection significantly impacts cancer incidence and mortality. For cancer prevention, unsweetened tea or coffee may be the optimal choice.
