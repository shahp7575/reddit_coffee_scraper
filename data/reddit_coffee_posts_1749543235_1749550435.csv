You walk in, order a coffee, and sit down to the comforting sound of chill lo-fi beats or soft indie music perfect background vibes for working or relaxing.

- Frantic jazz solo.

- Aggressive world percussion.

Or even worse: complete awkward silence.
Coincidence? I think not. I’m convinced there’s a “time threshold” where the playlist changes to make you uncomfortable enough to pack up and leave like a polite, passive-aggressive audio eviction.

I was feeling really vulnerable because I went for drinks with a friend and it was close to the place where my ex took me on our first date. Then I had to walk in the city center to get home and I passed in front of the place where we'd always meet up, not far from his apartment. 

I had done so well until that point. Now I'm deeply ashamed and disappointed. I'm scared this was a huge setback in my healing process. 

How do I get over the shame, anxiety, feelings of having betrayed myself? I feel like I ruined every possibility of becoming friends in the future. Which might not be a bad thing? IDEK anymore. I've been spiralling. I slept 4 hours tonight, jolted awake at 4.30 am from the adrenaline and the shame. 

Tonight Im going to the movies, which is really close to his place. It's in a complex with restaurants, groceries etc and that's where we used to go to get snacks, coffee and we went to the movies there once. Believe me I wont text anymore. But I feel so stressed and anxious and tense and it's going to be very hard yet again. But the shame and disappointment in myself are the worst right now...

1l7uw4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/kannada/comments/1l7uw4c/building_dreams_and_a_network_from_scratch_my/,Building Dreams and a Network from Scratch: My Journey as a Solo Architect in Bengaluru,"I’ve been lurking here for a while, soaking up all the wisdom and inspiration from this amazing community. Today, I want to share my story as a solo architect in Bengaluru, India, navigating the highs and lows of building my practice from the ground up over the past two years. It’s been a wild ride, and I hope my experience resonates with anyone trying to carve their own path in this field—or at least offers a glimpse into the grind!The Leap into Solo PracticeTwo years ago, I took a leap of faith. After working under some great mentors at established firms, I decided to go solo. I’m an architect with a passion for sustainable, context-driven design, and I wanted the freedom to create projects that aligned with my vision. Bengaluru, with its booming real estate, startup vibe, and diverse architectural landscape, seemed like the perfect place to set up shop. Plus, I was born and raised here, so I thought I had a decent lay of the land. Spoiler: Knowing the city and knowing its professional network are two very different things.Starting my own practice felt liberating at first—full control over my designs, my schedule, and my clients. But the reality of being a one-person show hit hard, fast. No HR team to handle paperwork, no marketing department to drum up leads, and no senior partner to lean on for advice. It was just me, my laptop, and a whole lot of ambition.The Struggle to Build a Contact BaseBengaluru’s architecture scene is vibrant but fiercely competitive. The city’s a mix of high-end developers, heritage conservationists, and budget-conscious clients, all with wildly different expectations. Breaking into this network as a solo architect with just two years of independent practice has been… let’s call it a character-building experience.

The Cold Call Conundrum: Early on, I underestimated how tough it is to build a client base from scratch. I spent months reaching out to potential clients—developers, homeowners, even small businesses—via emails, LinkedIn, and good ol’ phone calls. Most went unanswered. The ones who did reply often wanted “big names” or firms with a longer track record. I get it—trust is everything in architecture—but it stung to hear “come back when you have more experience” when I was already delivering solid work.Networking in a New Way: Bengaluru’s professional circles can feel like a walled garden. I started attending local architecture events, real estate expos, and even sustainability workshops to meet people. These were hit-or-miss. Some events led to great conversations. Others felt like cliquey gatherings where established architects swapped business cards while I sipped coffee in the corner.

 Pro tip: Always carry a portfolio on your phone—it’s a lifesaver when someone unexpectedly asks, “So, what do you do?”

The Social Media Hustle: I turned to Instagram and LinkedIn to showcase my work. Posting renders, sketches, and progress shots of my project (like a G+4 residence)  helped me get noticed. But curating a feed that looks professional while staying authentic is a time suck. And don’t get me started on the cost of hiring a photographer for finished projects—my wallet still hasn’t recovered.

The Local Challenge: Bengaluru’s clients often want quick turnarounds and low budgets, especially for residential projects. Balancing creativity with cost constraints is a tightrope walk. I’ve had clients love my designs but balk at the timeline or fees, expecting MNC-firm speed from a solo operation. Explaining that quality design takes time (and fair compensation) is a skill I’m still honing.The Wins Amid the StrugglesIt hasn’t all been doom and gloom. Two years in, I’ve had some victories that keep me going:Small but Mighty Projects: I’ve completed a couple of projects I’m proud of—a compact  home, a renovated residence in Indiranagar, and a startup office with a biophilic design. These projects are my calling card now, proof I can deliver.Word-of-Mouth Magic: My first few clients came from personal referrals (shoutout to my cousin who convinced his friend to hire me!). Those early projects led to more recommendations, slowly building my network. It’s a reminder that doing good work is the best marketing.Learning to Say No: Early on, I took every project that came my way, even ones that didn’t align with my vision or budget. Big mistake. Now, I’m learning to prioritize projects that let me flex my design muscles and clients who value my work.What I’ve Learned (and Advice for Others)Patience is Key: Building a contact base takes time. Focus on quality relationships over quantity. One solid client who trusts you is worth ten flaky leads.Collaborate Locally: Partnering with local contractors, material suppliers, or even other architects for small collaborations has opened doors. Bengaluru’s construction ecosystem thrives on these connections.Invest in Visibility: A simple website and active social media presence are non-negotiable. Even a basic portfolio site can make you look legit to potential clients.Stay True to Your Niche: For me, it’s sustainable design with a local flavor. Sticking to that has helped me stand out in a crowded market, even if it means turning down some projects.The Road AheadI’m still a small fish in Bengaluru’s big architectural pond, but I’m optimistic. The city’s growth means there’s room for fresh voices, and I’m determined to be one of them. My goal for the next year is to land a mid-sized commercial project and maybe (fingers crossed) hire an intern to help with the workload.To anyone else out there starting their own practice, especially in a bustling city like Bengaluru: it’s tough, but it’s worth it. Keep showing up, keep designing, and don’t be afraid to ask for help—or coffee meetups!What about you all? Any solo architects or freelancers out there with tips for building a network?

The day I found out I was pregnant, I walked in on my husband having sex with his adopted sister on our couch.  
  
When I confronted them, I started hemorrhaging badly—blood pouring down my legs. But Sebastian just scooped Vivian into his arms and stormed out, shouting:  
  
""Don't be so damn judgmental! Vivian was born without a vagina—it's a birth defect. As her brother, I just want her to experience intimacy before her reconstructive surgery!""  
  
""If you can't handle this, we'll divorce tomorrow. Once Vivian's surgery is over, we can remarry!""  
  
They rushed me to the ER as I bled everywhere. During my six-hour emergency surgery to save the baby, my phone kept buzzing. Vivian was sending me explicit videos, one after another.  
  
Our bedroom, his car, his office... her mouth on him, his hands all over her body, grinding against each other in every way possible...  
  
I realized they'd been doing everything except actual penetration this entire time—oral sex, mutual touching, dry humping like teenagers who couldn't go all the way.  
  
That night, I calmly signed the divorce papers and left the Walker family behind.  
  
Three years later, while volunteering at a rural Maine orphanage, I ran into my ex-husband.  
  
He wore that same arrogant smirk.  
  
""I'm New York's richest man now. Still think you made the right call walking out over something so trivial? I'm giving you one shot to come back.""  
  
What he didn't know was that I'd remarried—and my two-year-old was napping upstairs.  
  
……  
  
""Julia, this is pretty pathetic, don't you think?""  
  
""Radio silence for three years, then you magically show up in this dump right after I hit the Forbes list? Don't tell me this is some coincidence.""  
  
""Cut the act! I'm here on important business. Until you properly apologize to Vivian for what you did, I'm not taking you back!""  
  
Sebastian froze mid-step as he climbed out of his Maybach, spotting me outside the community housing. After a beat, he let out a mocking laugh.  
  
Vivian gracefully followed, her hand—adorned with a massive Graff wedding ring—casually sliding around Sebastian's arm.  
  
They looked like the perfect power couple.  
  
Even after three years, seeing them together like this still messed with my head.  
  
Back then, when Sebastian's father brought home a girl with a birth defect to be his adopted sister, teenage Sebastian completely lost it, pinching his nose and yelling:  
  
""Get her out of here! I don't want some freak as my sister! That's disgusting!""  
  
Watching Vivian huddle in the corner, trembling, I smacked Sebastian upside the head and took her cold hand in mine. I led her to the bathroom, wiped away her tears, and got her into soft pajamas.  
  
That's how Vivian became part of the Walker family.  
  
Her condition made her incredibly insecure and timid. Kids at school constantly bullied and mocked her.  
  
So I held her hand and taught her makeup, helped her pick out her first dress, stayed up all night helping her with homework.  
  
Watching Vivian grow more confident and radiant each day, getting closer to Sebastian—I thought I was doing something beautiful. I never imagined the two people I loved most would end up stabbing me in the back.  
  
When I didn't respond, Sebastian's eyes swept over the run-down housing behind me, his expression full of pity.  
  
""You regret leaving me, right? Look at yourself—you can't even afford decent rent. The dogs Vivian and I have live better than this.""  
  
""Think about it—your parents are dead. Besides me, your childhood sweetheart, who else do you have left?""  
  
Sebastian seemed to soften slightly, sighing.  
  
""Look, Vivian's feeling carsick. Stick around for a few days and take care of her. If she forgives you, you can come home.""  
  
""But remember—no more of that crazy jealous crap from three years ago. Vivian and I are innocent. Your paranoia just makes things uncomfortable for everyone.""  
  
Vivian immediately started stomping her feet, grabbing Sebastian's arm and whining like a child.  
  
""Babe! I'm never forgiving her!""  
  
""She ghosted us for three years—didn't even show up when you were in the hospital. Now that you're loaded, suddenly she appears!""  
  
Sebastian laughed and leaned down to kiss her lips softly.  
  
""Relax, baby. I'm just screwing with her. Why are you getting all worked up?""  
  
""You forgot we're getting married soon anyway.""  
  
That instantly cheered Vivian up, though she kept shooting me dirty looks.  
  
I took a deep breath and stepped back.  
  
""You've got this all wrong. I'm here volunteering.""  
  
I'd been coming to this small Maine town for a year now, ever since I met Principal Charlotte and promised to help out annually.  
  
Mr. Lewis, the sweet old teacher coordinating everything, nervously tried to back me up.  
  
""Yeah, yeah, Mr. Walker, you got it wrong about Ms. Grace. She's this botanist our principal brought in special. I was just giving her a ride since I was coming this way...""  
  
Sebastian snorted, his face turning cold.  
  
""Oh, cut the crap! Nice little performance! Maybe work on not stuttering through your lines next time?""  
  
""Julia, I was being generous here! If this is how you're gonna play it, then just screw off and stop wasting my time!""  
  
""Come on, Viv! Standing here another second is beneath us!""  
  
His engine roared as they peeled out, kicking up dust that had me and Mr. Lewis coughing our lungs out.  
  
Even with my usual patience, I was ready to tell them both where they could shove it.  
  
My phone buzzed—a text from my husband.  
  
\[\*Hey babe, you make it to town okay? Don't skip breakfast.\*\]  
  
Followed by some ridiculous cat cuddle GIF that was so unlike his usual serious self—God knows where he finds this stuff.  
  
I couldn't help grinning, my mood instantly lifting as I typed back.  
  
\[\*Matthew, you're being cute again! Already ate. Heading into town now—might lose signal.\*\]  
  
Mr. Lewis drove me in his beat-up van along crazy winding mountain roads for over three hours before we finally made it to the community center.  
  
He was leading me to the office to check in when I walked through the door and immediately wanted to turn around and leave.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The normally quiet office looked like some kind of smoky boardroom. Cigarette smoke everywhere, tables covered with coffee cups and overflowing ashtrays.  
  
Sebastian and Vivian were sitting there like king and queen, surrounded by a bunch of fancy-dressed businessmen kissing their asses.  
  
""Mr. Walker, you're incredible! Youngest billionaire in New York, and now you've got connections with the old-money families—sky's the limit for you!""  
  
""My company's nothing compared to yours—we're gonna need all the help we can get, Mr. Walker!""  
  
I coughed from all the smoke.  
  
Sebastian looked over at me with this ""I fucking knew it"" expression, holding up his hand to shut everyone up while staring at me like I was dirt.  
  
""Well, well. Julia, you really followed me all the way out here? That's even more desperate than I thought.""  
  
Everyone turned to stare at me.  
  
""Mr. Walker, who's this?""  
  
Sebastian's smirk got even nastier as he put on this fake sympathetic act.  
  
""Guys, meet my pathetic ex-wife. Now that I'm successful, she's stalking me like some psycho.""  
  
""Julia, since you begged your way out here, how about you start by getting everyone coffee? Maybe if you grovel enough, I'll throw you a bone.""  
  
All the businessmen immediately looked at me like I was trash.  
  
Someone looking to kiss Sebastian's ass immediately piped up.  
  
""Damn! Mr. Walker and his lady are relationship goals—everyone knows he's crazy about her. You're not even good enough to shine his shoes!""  
  
""Mr. Walker, you're way too nice! This bitch probably got used up and tossed aside, and now she's back 'cause you're loaded. Watch yourself!""  
  
Another guy shoved his cup forward aggressively:  
  
""Yo, waitress! Where's my water? How you gonna win back Mr. Walker with shitty service like that?""  
  
As the insults got worse, Vivian was cracking up like it was the best entertainment ever. She casually flicked her perfectly manicured nail, sending her water glass crashing to the floor.  
  
""Whoopsie! My bad, Julia sweetie! Clumsy me! You're such a doll—you'll clean this mess up and grab me a fresh glass, won't you?""  
  
Everyone erupted in laughter while Sebastian sat there with that cruel smirk, watching me like I was dirt.  
  
I chuckled softly and grabbed the water pitcher.  
  
I was about to drench the whole damn table when Mr. Lewis went bright red and frantically blocked me.  
  
""Ms. Grace, no! Please, let me—""  
  
""Folks, Ms. Grace here is VIP—our principal flew her in special from New York...""  
  
Sebastian slammed his foot into the table, his voice ice-cold.  
  
""Cut the shit! Same fucking story on repeat—we get it!""  
  
""She's my pathetic ex-wife! She screwed me over, so when I say jump, she asks how high! End of discussion!""  
  
One businessman made a show of standing up.  
  
""Well, if this is your idea of hospitality, you can kiss that funding goodbye...""  
  
Mr. Lewis completely lost it, running around trying to stop people from leaving, practically in tears.  
  
""Wait, please! You can't go—our principal's in the ICU and she trusted me to take care of you...""  
  
""She's gonna kill me if you all walk out...""  
  
I set down the pitcher, took a deep breath, and smiled at Mr. Lewis.  
  
""It's fine. They're our guests—I got this.""  
  
Watching me pour water for everyone, Sebastian finally looked pleased, giving me an approving nod.  
  
""There we go, Julia. Much better.""  
  
I ignored him completely, just kept their glasses filled.  
  
The conversation shifted back to business deals, Sebastian throwing in comments here and there while keeping his predatory gaze locked on me.  
  
What nobody saw was Vivian under the table, her fingers clawed together in rage, eyes burning with pure hatred.  
  
That afternoon, Mr. Lewis took me around to meet the kids.  
  
They were all hiding behind doorways, peeking out at me shyly.  
  
I pulled out the candy I'd brought and suddenly they were all over me like excited puppies, chattering non-stop.  
  
This sweet little girl named Lily Shaw picked some wildflowers and bashfully handed them over.  
  
""Ms. Grace, are you gonna be our teacher? You're so pretty—like a princess in the movies!""  
  
I grinned and scooped Lily up, taking her flowers.  
  
I had no clue that one innocent moment was about to royally screw us both over.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Next morning, I was alone in my room working on lesson plans.  
  
CRASH!  
  
Someone kicked my door clean off its hinges.  
  
Sebastian barged in, dragging little Lily by the arm, with teary-eyed Vivian and those angry businessmen right behind him.  
  
Sebastian looked absolutely murderous as he grabbed my wrist, examining it closely.  
  
The second he spotted my emerald bracelet, his eyes went black with fury.  
  
""Julia! Are you out of your goddamn mind? You're so hell-bent on screwing over Vivian that you got a kid to steal for you?!""  
  
I was totally lost, yanking my wrist away from Sebastian's death grip.  
  
""What are you even talking about?""  
  
Vivian stepped up, laser-focused on my emerald bracelet with tears pouring down her cheeks.  
  
""I'm not wrong. That bracelet—my mom walked barefoot for three days to reach the Vatican. She prayed for hours on those stone steps until her knees bled, just to get this blessed by the Pope himself before she died. I'd know it anywhere.""  
  
""Julia, why'd you steal the only thing I have left of her?""  
  
""Is this... is this payback for asking you to serve coffee yesterday?""  
  
""I swear I didn't mean it like that—I was just testing to see if you really loved Sebastian...""  
  
Vivian completely broke down while everyone looked at me like I was absolute trash.  
  
""Jesus, stealing from a dead woman—that's low even for you.""  
  
""Poor kid was just being nice and this psycho pulls this shit.""  
  
Sebastian looked at me like I made him sick.  
  
""Julia, I actually thought you'd grown up. When you served everyone yesterday, I figured maybe you were finally ready to fix things between us. Turns out you were planning this twisted crap the whole time!""  
  
""God, I almost felt bad for you!""  
  
Little Lily was trembling, staring up at me with scared eyes.  
  
""Ms. Grace... I found a purse and gave it back to the lady, but she says stuff's missing...""  
  
Everything suddenly made perfect sense.  
  
I pulled Lily behind me and laughed bitterly.  
  
""Vivian, you should've researched before trying to set me up. This bracelet was personally blessed by Pope Francis for my husband's family—it's literally one of a kind. Like you could ever have connections like that.""  
  
Vivian's pupils dilated—she obviously had no clue this simple-looking bracelet had such prestigious origins.  
  
But everyone just burst out laughing at my words.  
  
""This crazy bitch is making up stories now.""  
  
""Stop it!"" Sebastian's face twisted with disgust. ""Enough with the lies, Julia! When the hell did I ever get you papal jewelry?""  
  
""The Vatican doesn't just hand out blessings to nobodies like me. Quit making a fool of yourself! And one more thing...""  
  
He smirked, his voice dripping with contempt.  
  
""Don't call me your husband. We're divorced, remember?""  
  
I took a deep breath, ready to tell him exactly where he could shove it.  
  
""Sebastian, I'm already married to—""  
  
Suddenly Vivian hit the floor hard.  
  
Her whole body started seizing, foam bubbling from her mouth—it was horrifying.  
  
Sebastian went white, diving into Vivian's bag and pulling out an emergency inhaler, jamming it between her teeth like he'd done it a million times.  
  
A few seconds later, the convulsions stopped and Vivian curled up in Sebastian's arms like a broken bird, silently shaking.  
  
Everyone was freaked out by what just went down.  
  
When Sebastian looked at me again, his eyes were pure venom.  
  
""Julia! You know damn well that three years ago your drama gave Vivian PTSD seizures that she still hasn't gotten over...""  
  
Vivian weakly grabbed his shirt.  
  
""Babe, stop... I know Julia's not evil. She's just pissed about what happened before, pissed that I'm wearing your ring now.""  
  
""This bracelet is all I have left of my mom. If Julia gives it back, I'll get out of your lives forever...""  
  
Everyone was eating up this poor suffering angel act.  
  
They all started going off on her behalf.  
  
""Mr. Walker, you can't seriously consider taking back someone like her! Don't do that to your girl!""  
  
""Yeah, call the damn cops! Both of them need to learn a lesson!""  
  
Sebastian stared at me with pure hatred burning in his eyes.  
  
""Julia, since you won't own up to what you did, you and this kid can rot in jail together!""  
  
The door suddenly exploded open—  
  
""Over my dead body!""

**Learning function:** GE Universal Remotes frequently enough include a learning function. This allows the remote to “learn” commands from your original device remotes simply by pointing the remotes at each other and going through a programming sequence within the GE remote's instructions.

This ensures that even if a device isn't pre-programmed, you can still control it by teaching the GE remote its signals.

**Ergonomic Design:** GE remotes are designed with user comfort in mind, featuring a contoured shape and strategically placed buttons. This ergonomic design ensures that the remote is agreeable to hold and use for extended periods.

The button layout is intuitive and easy to navigate,even in low-light conditions.

**Backlighting:** Certain models of the GE Universal Remote offer backlighting of the buttons. This is a great solution for low-light conditions and allows for quick navigation in dark home theater environments. The buttons illuminate, making it easy to find the correct button for the function you need.

Backlighting allows you to easily control your television or connected devices from any location in the room.

Key features of the GE Universal Remote include:

*   Broad device compatibility

I've had a rough time coming back to work after mat leave. I made a request to drop to p/t, which was accommodated, and I'm grateful for that. However, my manager made the decision not to hire in someone new for my remaining hours but to give some of my role responsibilities to other members of the team (all of whom already worked f/t fyi). I didn't push back on this and I wish now that I had done. I was also prepared to make this a permanent change, but he wanted it to be temporary, and presented this as something for me: 'it's your job, just in case you change your mind.' In regards to one of my colleagues and my old programme, my initial understanding was that I would have a sort of overseeing role over what happened: she would run the programme day-to-day, but I would be involved in setting of strategy, for example. This also chimed with my manager's 'it's your job, you can go back to it anytime, I want you to have a job you want to go back to', talk. My manager specifically used the word 'mentor' about me towards my colleague. However, after a few months, it became clear to me that she wasn't interested in having me as a mentor and was actively avoiding me. She asked everyone in my team their advice on my programme except me. My manager remained her line manager and she spoke only to him about her ideas for the programme. I asked him about this a couple of times - firstly to get clarification over who should be making decisions (as I didn't want to be held responsible for decisions that I'd had no part in), and later to point out that she was cancelling meetings with me last minute, not asking for help or advice (or only doing it to the wider team on days I wasn't working) and that she clearly wasn't interested in having me as a 'mentor'. I told him that if there was nothing explicit he wanted for her and me in this 'mentoring' relationship (and I assumed there wasn't as the team wasn't restructured), then I would leave the programme to her. Initially he took this badly - said he was disappointed in me - but when I said I wasn't refusing to help, I was saying I would only help if I was explicitly asked, he softened. This all felt really awful- I'm still not entirely sure why my colleague (who I really liked up until this situation) considers me such an irrelevance to a programme I set up. However, I'm also upset about my manager's inability to take charge of a team and to be explicit about the roles and responsibilities of each team member, rather than just talking in lovely platitudes. I'm upset about him essentially making me vulnerable to my colleague's disregard of me by his messy management skills and I'm really upset that when I came to him to say that I was unhappy about the situation, he told me that I was the disappointment for suggesting a way to clarify the relationship. 

So, that is the context. My relationship with my colleague has deteriorated since then. I have offered no advice on my old programme (but have not been asked for any either), however, her clear lack of respect for me has increased. She constantly criticises my handling of my remaining programme. I asked for the team's advice on a change to my programme, and she essentially said I wouldn't be able to handle the change, I had too much on my plate, I'd only just come back and I needed to let things settle down before I tried to change anything. It was extraorindarily partonising and she did it in front of all my colleagues. Furthermore, the change was something that had come from my line manager, not me, but he wasn't in the meeting and so didn't see her refuse to help implement it. When he came back into another meeting with a (in my opinion), less well thought out change, because the other one had been rejected, she heaped praise on the idea. It seemed pretty clear that she thought the first idea was mine so she shat on it, but thought the next one was my line manager's so said it was brilliant.   
  
During delivery of our two programmes, I supported her to do what she wanted, I didn't question her, I kept my head down and did what was asked. However, during my programme delivery, she abandoned the job I asked her to do, made out that she didn't need to do it because everything was fine and another colleague was handling it, and then I had to step in and do it for her when I realised that actually everything was falling apart. Since then, I have had feedback from various people that this location was a disaster - the staff member that remained in post copped most of the blame, but I am aware that things wouldn't have been so difficult for her if she hadn't been abandoned by my other colleague. This felt like a deliberate attempt by my colleague to sabotage my programme. 

In the last week we had a team reflection on the year, which I found very difficult. It brought up a few other frustrations across the team, which I have been trying to get clarity on but no one (colleagues or line manager) will help on. I brought up how difficult I have found it being p/t and feeling like I am not able to contribute or be in the team as much as before. This was very much a, 'I know this is my choice, I know I can't be f/t right now' statement. But instead of talking about this (ie my feelings of increasing isolation from my team and how processes could be fixed to help p/t staff members - my whole team is f/t so I don't think they realise what gets missed for part-timers), my manager said that he was f/t and he still couldn't be part of everything he wanted to be part of. 

My colleague has now sent me a private message, asking for a coffee because she wants to 'reflect' on how the past year has gone and how she can 'support' me moving forward. I said yes, but then immeidately felt I was about to get ambushed. I have written back politely to ask her what she would like to reflect on and she won't be specific. I asked if she wanted to talk about one of the topics I have been asking for clarity on and she replied, 'yes we can chat about that.' But because she still hadn't said why she wanted the meeting I pushed again, to ask what \*she\* wanted to talk about. The reply has been, 'it was just more of a general catch up. Nothing formal.'   
  
Her initial message asked for us to 'reflect' because it was 'important' and how she could 'best support me'. Now none of that, to me, sounds like a general catch up. I also doubt she has asked any of my other colleagues to do this with her - especially since we have just done a team reflection. I'm exceedingly reluctant to be on my own with this woman and leave myself vulnerable to personal criticism, manipulations or other things that will leave me feeling inadequate in my job or bad about myself. I recognise there is conflict between her and me, but if that is something she wants to resolve, I would prefer it to be appropriately mediated. I know I am very bad at expressing myself in a fraught situation, I react quickly (either warmly or harshly) and regret at leisure. 

My questions are - do you think I'm overreacting? Do you think I can pull out of the meeting now because she won't say what she wants to talk about? Or should I suggest mediation? Or should I do something else entirely? I know I am miserable in my current work situation and I have been looking for other posts, but the only job interview I have been offered is a massive step-down in pay and is fixed term, versus my current permanent job.

I Slept Your Tycoon Uncle for Revenge Novel""-After her rebirth, the first thing Isabella Claymore did was fall to her knees before her parents, her voice trembling with earnest conviction.","Chapter 1  
  
After her rebirth, the first thing Isabella Claymore did was fall to her knees before her parents, her voice trembling with earnest conviction.  
  
""Dad, Mom... regarding the arranged marriage with the Moretti family, I choose to marry Lucius Moretti.""  
  
Her parents exchanged bewildered glances at their daughter's unexpected request.  
  
""Isabella, honey,"" her mother said gently, ""aren't you in love with Ronan? Lucius is his uncle.""  
  
Something flickered in Isabella's eyes—a shadow of pain that made her voice catch.  
  
""It's precisely because I know the consequences of loving him that I can't afford to anymore.""  
  
""Dad, Mom, I've never asked anything of you before. As the daughter who's enjoyed all the privileges of this family, I understand that an arranged marriage is my responsibility. But this... this is the one thing I’m asking for. Just this once—please, I’m begging you.""  
  
Seeing their daughter's forehead red from kowtowing, her parents sighed and helped her to her feet. ""If you’re really sure about this, we’ll talk to the Morettis. The only thing is—Lucius is in a pretty powerful position. He might say no. You need to be ready for that.""  
  
While comforting their daughter, the Claymores prepared generous gifts for their visit to the Moretti estate.  
  
As the black sedan disappeared down the driveway, Isabella turned back toward the familiar living room, everything feeling surreal.  
  
Suddenly, her phone buzzed.  
  
\[Midnight Lounge. Come now.\]  
  
It was from Ronan Moretti, along with the bar's address. Thinking this might be the perfect opportunity to clarify the change in marriage arrangements, Isabella headed over.  
  
The moment she pushed open the private room door, a bucket of ice water came crashing down, soaking her completely.  
  
The shock of the cold water penetrated her skin, making her shiver as cruel laughter erupted around her.  
  
""Well, well, if it isn't the Claymore princess! Look at you, drenched like a drowned rat!""  
  
""Serves her right! Always chasing after Ronan like some pathetic lapdog—this is what desperate bitches get!""  
  
Ronan approached with a cold expression, his eyes dark with contempt.  
  
""Are you that desperate to marry me? The arrangement was barely discussed, and you're already pushing your parents to finalize wedding plans. Now everyone in Chicago knows about our supposed engagement. Happy now?""  
  
Isabella realized he'd misunderstood everything.  
  
She wiped the water from her face, pushing back her wet hair, and looked at him with unexpected calm.  
  
""The Claymore-Moretti alliance was always inevitable. It makes no difference which family initiates the discussion. But don't worry—this has nothing to do with you.""  
  
Ronan froze for a moment, then let out a harsh laugh. ""Nothing to do with me? Don’t tell me you actually think you’re marrying someone else. Come on—who the hell in the Moretti family would even want you?""  
  
Before Isabella could respond, the door burst open.  
  
Heyar Whitlow stumbled in, tears streaming down her face at the scene before her.  
  
""Ronan… I heard you’re getting married. I wasn’t sure if I should come, but… I just wanted to say congratulations. I truly hope you and Miss Claymore will be happy together. Forever. Really.""  
  
With that, she fled the room, her sobs echoing in the hallway.  
  
""Heyar, wait!""  
  
Ronan instantly panicked, brushing Isabella aside as he rushed after her.  
  
Isabella crashed into the coffee table, her forehead splitting open. Blood trickled down her face in a gruesome stream.  
  
As pain shot through her skull, she watched their retreating figures and memories from her past life came flooding back.  
  
In her previous life, Isabella and Ronan had grown up together, childhood sweethearts with what seemed like an unbreakable bond.  
  
When their parents mentioned the arranged marriage, Isabella remembered all of Ronan's tender care over the years and chose him without hesitation.  
  
But after the engagement was announced, his attitude toward her began to shift—from anger to indifference, and finally to disgust.  
  
Isabella couldn't understand why, but she married him anyway, believing things would improve after the wedding.  
  
Even after their daughter was born, nothing changed. Then one day, she discovered thousands of photographs of Heyar hidden in his study.  
  
That's when she realized the truth: he'd always loved the housekeeper's daughter, but their class differences made such a relationship impossible.  
  
When Heyar married another man two years later, the marriage was troubled from the start. Ronan drowned his sorrows in alcohol, mourning for her happiness.  
  
The day Heyar's husband died in a car accident was the happiest day of Ronan's life.  
  
Isabella witnessed it all, her heart breaking piece by piece, but she forced herself to focus solely on raising their daughter.  
  
Until the kidnapping.  
  
Both their daughter and Heyar's son were taken. When the kidnappers forced Ronan to choose which child to save, he hesitated for only seconds before choosing the boy—who wasn't even his blood relative.  
  
The next moment, their daughter was pushed from the rooftop.  
  
Isabella watched her child die and threw herself from the same building.  
  
Now, given a second chance, she refused to torture herself again. She would cut all ties with Ronan Moretti.  
  
Back in the private room, the crowd continued their cruel mockery.  
  
""You can't force love, right? I mean, sure—he might marry her, but what’s the point if he spends every night in someone else’s bed?""  
  
""She chased his ass for years just to end up alone in a mansion, waiting on a man who’s never showing up. huh? Serves her right.""  
  
A sudden buzz cut through the laughter—Isabella’s phone was ringing.  
  
A message from her parents appeared on the screen:  
  
""Isabella! Lucius agreed! The wedding is in two weeks!""  
  
Her usually composed parents had used three exclamation points, showing just how shocked and thrilled they were by Lucius Moretti's acceptance.  
  
Isabella felt a wave of relief wash over her.  
  
She stood up, steadied herself, and faced the room full of mockers with newfound determination in her eyes.  
  
“My future has nothing to do with you—or with Ronan Moretti.""  
  
""Tell him this: I'm getting married in two weeks. And he won't be the groom.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After leaving the bar, Isabella went to the hospital to treat her wound.  
  
When she returned home, she gathered everything related to Ronan—photos, letters, gifts—and packed them all away in boxes.  
  
Her parents arrived just as she was sealing the last container.  
  
""Isabella,"" her mother asked gently, ""have you truly let go of Ronan? You're really over him?""  
  
Seeing their daughter nod without hesitation, both parents visibly relaxed.  
  
""Glad to hear that,"" her father said with a smile. ""Lucius is busy overseas, but the Moretti family arranged a video call today to finalize everything.""  
  
""Lucius is definitely more mature and put-together than Ronan—honestly, he’s a much better fit for you. We never even considered him an option, thought someone like him would never go for this. So yeah, we were pretty shocked when he said yes without hesitation.""  
  
Isabella's eyes filled with tears.  
  
From the moment she'd made her decision, she'd known Lucius would say yes.  
  
In her past life, the age difference and his cold, commanding presence had kept everyone at a distance—including Isabella. They rarely interacted outside of family gatherings.  
  
All she'd known was that he was completely devoted to his work, having built a business empire from nothing, and had never married.  
  
When he died by suicide at thirty-five, they found a stack of love letters while clearing out his belongings.  
  
Each one was addressed ""To my Stella,"" and no one in the Moretti family knew who was stella.  
  
Only Isabella knew. She was born on a night full of falling stars, and “Stella” was the nickname her grandpa always used—just his special name for her.  
  
She'd never realized that the cold, unreachable man had loved her silently for an entire lifetime.  
  
Now that fate had given her a second chance, she wanted to give them both an opportunity.  
  
Lost in thought, she barely noticed her parents approaching with an elegant gift box.  
  
""Sweetie, tomorrow's your birthday,"" her mother explained warmly. ""Lucius couldn't fly back in time, so he had his assistant retrieve this from his study. Do you like it?""  
  
Inside lay a breathtakingly brilliant diamond ring.  
  
Isabella recognized it immediately—""Stardust,"" the most expensive engagement ring sold at Sotheby's in the past fifty years.  
  
She'd seen it once at an exhibition and never forgotten its beauty.  
  
That Lucius would send such a priceless gift filled her heart with unexpected warmth.  
  
In her past life, after their engagement, Ronan had never given her another gift.  
  
She'd forgotten what it felt like to receive something precious from someone who cared.  
  
The next evening, Isabella's birthday celebration began promptly at seven in Chicago's most luxurious hotel.  
  
Guests offered their congratulations, and with the marriage arrangement finally settled, Isabella felt a weight lift from her shoulders. For the first time in months, she found herself genuinely smiling.  
  
Then commotion erupted near the entrance, and every head turned toward the door.  
  
Isabella followed their gaze and froze. Ronan had arrived—with Heyar on his arm.  
  
But that wasn't the most humiliating part. The worst was yet to come: a group of Ronan's friends marched through the crowd carrying an enormous placard.  
  
In bold letters across the center, it read:  
  
HYPOCRITE  
  
For: Isabella Claymore  
  
Guests pressed forward to gawk, whispering and pointing.  
  
Isabella's face went pale.  
  
Her hands clenched into fists as she stared at the troublemakers, her voice cutting through the noise like ice.  
  
""What the hell is this?""  
  
The group sneered at her, deliberately raising their voices for everyone to hear.  
  
""Oh please, you tell us! Yesterday you swore Ronan wasn’t the groom, but the second he got home, his whole family was already knee-deep in wedding plans. Seriously, who plays hard to get like you do, Princess? This sign fits perfectly!""  
  
""Please, we all knew she was faking it yesterday. She’s been chasing Ronan for years—girl left her pride at the door a long time ago. And now she suddenly doesn’t want him? Yeah, right. Classic move. Like, who else is she gonna marry? He’s the only Moretti her age.""  
  
Cruel laughter rippled through the ballroom.  
  
Ronan's expression was stone-cold as he addressed her. ""Isabella, stop with these hypocritical games. Don't think this will get my attention. Once we’re married, you’ll have the Moretti name—don’t expect a damn thing more.""  
  
She'd heard those exact words in her previous life.  
  
And he'd kept his promise. Seven years of marriage, and the name was all she'd ever received.  
  
The crowd buzzed with gossip as Isabella took a shaky breath and raised her voice.  
  
""Ronan Moretti! I don't need your name. Listen carefully—you are not my groom, and it's not with someone my age. It's with your—""  
  
Before she could finish, chaos erupted.  
  
Heyar suddenly clutched her face, red welts spreading across her skin as she collapsed into Ronan's arms.  
  
""Ronan… I—I can’t breathe… why are there so many hyacinths? You know I’m allergic…""  
  
Hyacinths were Isabella's favorite flowers, and the ballroom was filled with elaborate arrangements.  
  
Hearing Heyar's increasingly labored breathing, Ronan panicked, calling her name frantically before sweeping her into his arms.  
  
As he rushed toward the exit, he shouted two commands:  
  
To Isabella: ""When we’re married, there will be no hyacinths—ever. Not in the house, not at events, not anywhere.""  
  
To his friends: ""After I leave, destroy this entire party!""  
  
""Got it, boss. Consider it done.""  
  
The moment he disappeared, the group descended like vandals, grabbing chairs and wreaking havoc.  
  
The birthday cake splattered across the marble floor, crystal glasses shattered against walls, and flowers were trampled into pulp as guests fled in terror.  
  
""Stop! You have no right to destroy my birthday party! Stop!""  
  
""You're marrying our boy Ronan, sweetheart! Wife obeys husband—whatever he says goes! Ha ha ha!""  
  
Isabella screamed until her voice gave out, but couldn't stop the rampage. Her protests only brought more cruel laughter.  
  
Eventually, every guest had fled.  
  
Her birthday party ended in ruins.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
For the next several days, Isabella locked herself in her room with red-rimmed eyes, refusing to see anyone.  
  
When her parents learned what Ronan had done at the birthday party, they felt even more certain that not choosing him had been the right decision. They wanted to confront the Moretti family directly, but Isabella, who had barely stepped out of her room in days, stopped them.  
  
With the wedding so close, she didn't want any more complications.  
  
After calming her parents, she left the house carrying a design sketch.  
  
She hadn't been hiding in her room obsessing over Ronan—he meant nothing to her now. Instead, she'd been designing a wedding ring for Lucius, crafted by her own hand.  
  
She knew how much “Stardust” meant to him, and she wanted to give him something just as meaningful in return.  
  
She gave the design to the family's jeweler, asking him to have a master craftsman create it personally.  
  
But when the agreed deadline arrived, the ring never came.  
  
When Isabella inquired, she learned that Ronan had visited the shop days earlier. He'd spotted the ring immediately, asked a few questions, then simply taken it.  
  
His parting words: ""It's for me anyway. No need to call Isabella for pickup.""  
  
The staff, knowing about the Claymore-Moretti engagement, hadn't intervened.  
  
Isabella's heart sank like a stone.  
  
She rushed to the Moretti estate to retrieve the ring, only to find Heyar sitting among piles of delivery boxes, cooing sweetly.  
  
""Mr. Ronan, you secretly cleared out my shopping cart again! You're so sweet—I'll never be able to repay you.""  
  
""I do it because I want to. You don't need to repay anything. And I've told you before—stop calling me that. Use my name.""  
  
Heyar blushed prettily as she whispered, ""Ronan.""  
  
Watching their intimate exchange, Isabella didn't even blink as she strode through the door.  
  
Hearing footsteps, Ronan looked up and frowned.  
  
""What are you doing here?""  
  
""The wedding ring you took. Give it back.""  
  
Seeing Isabella's outstretched hand, Ronan raised an eyebrow.  
  
""It's gone.""  
  
Isabella's gaze sharpened, her voice hardening. ""What do you mean, gone?""  
  
Before Ronan could make up an excuse, Heyar spoke up from the floor, her voice timid.  
  
""Oh… Miss Claymore, I just saw online that wedding rings are great for opening packages, so I used it for a few… hundred. It’s a little scratched now. I mean… if it still matters to you, you can have it back?""  
  
She opened her palm, revealing the once-beautiful ring now marred with deep scratches.  
  
Ronan had given her wedding ring—designed with love for another man—to Heyar as a glorified box cutter?  
  
Rage ignited in Isabella's chest, spreading through her entire body.  
  
Unable to control herself any longer, she stared at the two uncaring faces before her, her eyes blazing.  
  
""“Ronan, what the hell gave you the right to take something that wasn’t yours? And you, Heyar—how dare you treat it like garbage? Do either of you even understand what basic respect means?""  
  
Seeing her break down over a simple ring ruined Ronan's good mood, irritation creeping into his voice.  
  
""The wedding ring was meant for me anyway. What are you making such a fuss about?""  
  
""Oh, and I've decided we'll just get the marriage certificate. No ceremony. So your ring design was pointless—don't waste any more effort.""  
  
His dismissive attitude made Isabella clench her fists as she declared once more:  
  
""Ronan, that wedding ring was never meant for you!""  
  
""If not me, then who? Isabella, enough. You’re taking this way too far!""  
  
As he spoke, Ronan carelessly tossed the damaged ring aside and pulled Heyar toward the door.  
  
""Don't waste time arguing with her. Heyar, didn't you say you wanted to learn to drive? Come on, I'll teach you.""  
  
Watching them leave, Isabella felt waves of anger and helplessness crash over her. She wanted to chase after them, but first she had to find the ring.  
  
It took thirty minutes of searching before she found it in a flower bed.  
  
Carefully tucking it into her pocket, she left immediately. There wasn't time to create a new one—she'd have to find someone to repair this one and hope it could be restored.  
  
Just as she stepped outside the estate, she heard a strange noise.  
  
Looking up, she saw a car barreling straight toward her. Isabella's eyes widened in shock.  
  
The impact sent her flying ten meters, landing in a spreading pool of blood.  
  
Heyar climbed out of the driver's seat, putting on a show of terror.  
  
""Oh no, oh no! I didn’t mean to! I’m still new at driving—I must’ve hit the gas instead of the brake… how stupid of me! This is awful… there’s so much blood! Miss Claymore looks really bad… Ronan, is she gonna be okay?""  
  
Seeing the stone steps stained crimson, Ronan frowned but pulled Heyar into his arms, comforting her gently.  
  
""She's fine. Isabella's always been dramatic—this is just another performance. Just ignore her. She'll stop pretending when she gets tired of it. Don't be scared, Heyar. Don't cry.""  
  
Through her haze of pain, hearing those words made Isabella feel cold to her very core. Tears she could no longer hold back began to fall.  
  
Ronan... I thought that even if you didn't love me, after all our years of growing up together, you'd feel something. Anything.  
  
But you'd rather comfort Heyar than care whether I live or die.  
  
Why did I ever fall in love with you in my past life?  
  
She tried to reach for her phone to call for help, but her strength gave out completely.  
  
Endless darkness crashed over her, drowning her consciousness.  
  
When she opened her eyes again, it was the next day.  
  
Shortly after she awoke, a doctor entered with her chart, his voice stern.  
  
""Why wasn't she brought in immediately after the accident? Making her lose all that blood before seeking medical attention—that's completely irresponsible.""  
  
Remembering the scene before she'd lost consciousness, Isabella moved her lips but could only manage a bitter smile. How could she explain that her childhood sweetheart had been too busy comforting another woman to save her life?  
  
The doctor didn't press the issue, simply continuing, ""Where's your husband? He needs to handle the admission paperwork.""  
  
Still groggy from anesthesia, Isabella answered without thinking.  
  
""He's overseas.""  
  
The moment the words left her mouth, the hospital room door swung open.  
  
Ronan stood in the doorway, staring at her intently.  
  
""Who's overseas""

When she woke up six years earlier she decided to change everything. Revenge would be something she focused [on.My](http://on.My) Fiction

Chapter 1

“Please don’t do this.” I begged over and over, but no one was listening. I thrashed against their hold, but nothing. “I am your luna.” I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me. 

“Luke please.” I begged once more time, my voice hoarse.

“Kill it once it’s done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.”

He can’t mean that. This was our baby. “Our baby.” 

“Is a mistake from the moon goddess. One I will rectify.” His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn’t even face me. “Now do it. That’s an order.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

It was a mistake to come here. 

It was a mistake to give him everything. 

“Oh, and doctor?” Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. “Don’t use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.”

“Yes, Luna.” The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed. 

I’m sorry, baby. Momma couldn’t save you. She wanted you so, so much. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade. 

“Silver?” My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn’t want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof. But I never touched another wolf, nor would I again, not after this betrayal. 

Why, Moon Goddess, why would you give him to me just to take him away? My pup.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us. 

“Bring me the body of the pup.”

“Yes Alpha.” I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I started to scream, soon I felt the blood trickling down my side, every drip off of me hitting the floor. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak. 

I’m sorry, baby.

They weren’t trying to keep me alive, which I expected, but I wished wasn’t true. I used to love my mate, but I felt the love die in me when I saw my pup being ripped from my belly.

“Please, let me hold him once.” I tried to move my arms to reach for him, but I was still tied down. The doctor, who was shedding tears, brought my pup and laid him on my chest. 

He was perfect. I rubbed his scent on my face and mine on his. He would forever be a part of my soul. 

My missing piece. 

“Doctor, now.”

“Yes Alpha.” The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements. 

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place. 

“I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. And I have, over and over, since he found out of your betrayal.” Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. “He is perfection. And don’t worry. I will give him another son.” She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. “What’s so funny?”

“I can smell the beta on you. That’s Derek’s child, and it’s a girl. Nice try though.”

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again. 

“You bitch!” He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room. 

“Brandon!” Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. “What’s wrong?” She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

“You lied!” He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver traveling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. “This was my pup. I can smell me on him. He was mine.” Brandon’s eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. “You said she cheated on me and that it wasn’t my pup.”

“She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.”

“You said you smelt it.” From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon. 

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls. 

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup. 

“Save her.”

“No!” Shannon screamed. “I am the Luna now, you marked me last night.” Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night. His betrayal had bile shoot into my mouth. “I am bearing your pup.”

I started to laugh again. I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. “Stay with me Amy.”

“Beta’s baby. She is fucking…the beta.” I choked out the words and laughed as horror bloomed in his eyes. Blood flew from my mouth as I smiled again. 

“Save her.”

“No!” I slammed out, putting all of my power in it. “Don’t move.” I used my Alpha strength to freeze everyone, including my mate. 

“How?” Brandon looked down at me, pleading. “Let me save you.”

“I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don’t deserve to save me. You don’t deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything.” I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body. 

And then I was free.

Chapter 2

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. “Amy hurry, you’re going to be late.” I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? “Amy!” The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom. 

I hadn’t stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother’s arms. “Mom, you’re here.” I started to cry. “I’ve missed you so much.”

“Amy. My girl.” She laughed as she patted my back. “I saw you yesterday.” She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. “Happy birthday, baby.”

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. “Thank you, mom.”

“Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life.” She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn’t want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

“I’d rather stay here with you.” I smiled as I kissed her cheek. “I don’t want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he killed my baby and me. He killed my mother for her involvement. Shannon’s father, my mother’s husband, watched her die. Don’t get me wrong I knew he loved my mother, and he was hurting, but his scheming daughter was the cause of all of this. He stood by and watched it all happen. 

I understood why he supported his daughter, but I didn’t like it, nor him, for that matter.

“Baby. You won’t miss us. We will be there every step of the way.” She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers. 

“Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy’s pack?” My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn’t a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk. But he swore it was a mistake. It was another Alpha’s maneuverings to break them up, but my mother said it didn’t matter. It was too late. 

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

“No baby. I can’t go back.” My mother’s face fell as she turned away.

“I don’t want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don’t want a mate.” I whispered my new truth.

“Mates don’t hurt each other, baby.” She tried to smile but I shook. I knew exactly what mates do to each other.

“Would you be made if I refused my mate?”

“God no baby. The Moon Goddess makes a path clear, but it is up to us to choose it. If you don’t want your mate, you can reject him.”

“And if it is the Alpha’s son?”

My mother looked at me. She knew that if it was the Alpha’s son, I would be screwed. They wouldn’t allow me to leave. An Alpha has to mate his first mate, even for a day to come into his full power. “What do you know?” I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. “I don’t know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon’s boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta.” I pulled back. “I don’t want this for me.”

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. “Okay baby. But you can’t leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.”

I tossed my hands in the air. “How would I do that?”

“There is much you don’t know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure…” She trailed off and I just nodded my head. “Then let me make a few calls. You don’t have to go to school today.”

I lept back into her arms. “Thank you, mom. I don’t know what I would do without you.”

“I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you.” She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room. 

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I rubbed my flat stomach. “Don’t worry, my pup. This time around, no one will hurt you.”

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open. 

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn’t do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited. 

“I’m telling you, if she is Brandon’s mate, I’m going to kill her.”

“You can’t mean that, Shan.” The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon’s best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

“Of course I do. Brandon is mine.”

“Only because you put out. He was hoping Amy would notice him.”

“You shut your fucking mouth, Megan.” Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. “He’s mine.”

“Whatever I gotta go. Hurry the fuck up before I leave your ass,” Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand. 

“What do you think you’re doing in my closet?”

“Amy?” Shannon’s mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

“You’re lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to kill me. Didn’t I hear that correctly? A beta’s daughter threatening an alpha.” I tsked.

“I didn’t do shit.” She snarled back at me as her hand reformed. 

“Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal.” I couldn’t stop my grin as I felt her tremble. “Did you threaten me?”

“Yes.” she screamed at me. “You’re going to take Brandon from me.”

“I don’t want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him.” I pushed her away. “Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you.” I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

“What the fuck is your problem?”

“You. Now leave.” I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Stupid bitch. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

Chapter 3

“Pack your bags, Amy.” My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making. 

“What?” I looked up. “Why?”

“You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha.” Mom smiled down at me. “Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.”

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. “I can go?”

“Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.”

I pouted. “Mom, I really don’t want to be here.” I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn’t risk him finding me.

“It’s okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad.” She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. “Now get ready.”

“Okay mom.” I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open. 

“I fucking knew it.” I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

“Shannon, why are you screaming?” Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room. 

“I’m not Brandon’s mate, daddy.” Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms. 

“How are you so sure?” Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

“It’s you. You stupid whore.” Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

“Amy!” Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked. 

“Morgan, you can’t yell at Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first.” My mom placed my breakfast on the table. “Amy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.”

“Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?”

“She is going away for the summer. To her fathers.” My mother turned to me and opened her arms. “Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.”

I walked over and sat down, and dug in. 

“Why is she going to her dads?” Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up. 

“She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?” My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn’t know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it. 

“Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven’t seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom.” I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled. 

“You’re leaving?” Shannon stood up.

“Yup. I’ll be gone the full summer.” I smirked over at her. “But my room is locked, and it will stay that way.” My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command. 

“Amy!” Morgan yelled out. “You know you’re not allowed to alpha command your step sister!” 

“And I wouldn’t have Morgan, if I hadn’t found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet.” I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie. 

“Is that true?” Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

“I wouldn’t lie. I’ll just command you to tell the truth.” She screeched and stomped her foot.

“Yes!” she screamed. “Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon’s mate.”

“How?” I threw up my hands, playing like I didn’t know the truth. “How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.”

“Because he scented you on me!” Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

“Calm down. You’re hurting everyone’s ears and just explain yourself.” My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

“Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy’s dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I’m not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me.” Shannon pouted.

“So he likes the way I smell, doesn’t mean we are mates.” I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn’t accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

“Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell.” Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. “He’s the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her.” She pointed to me. 

I scoffed. “I don’t want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day in hell before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon.” I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves. 

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It’s said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs. 

But either way, I wasn’t lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon’s vicinity.

“You’re lying. He’s the alpha.”

“And?”

“Everyone wants to be the luna.”

“Idiots want to be the luna.” I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

“That’s for you.”

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

Chapter 4

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely takin a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver’s arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. “Hey love bug.”

“Uncle Ronnie. I’ve missed you.” I climbed over the seats and sat up front. “What are you doing here?” Ronnie was my dad’s beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life. 

“You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.” 

“Dad sent you?” I laughed.

“Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da.” He smiled over and laughed with me. “As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.” 

“He didn’t have to.” I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt. 

“Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you’re sending in the summer. What’s going on?” My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head. 

“I don’t want to be here.”

“Why?”

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. “I’m afraid that my mate is here and I don’t want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.”

“Why wouldn't you want your mate?” My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport. 

“I’ll tell both you and dad, just not now.” My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding. 

“Fine, but I want the full story.”

“You will get it, I swear.” I nodded back to the road. “Now focus on driving so you don’t kill us.” I grabbed the wheel, swerving back into our own lane. 

“Fuck!” Uncle Ronnie grabbed the wheel from me and focused back on the road. “I just worry about you, pup.” I couldn’t stop the laugh because wolves stopped aging at twenty-five, and he looked barely older than me.

“I know you do.” I settled back into my seat and sighed. “I promise, what happened isn’t going to make that feeling any better.” I wiped at my face. “I don’t even know why my mom is sending me to my dad. She just said that he could help me.”

“Well, let’s hurry and get back so we can figure out what you need, Sugar.” My uncle hit the gas, and we ended up at the airport in no time. 

We loaded my bags and headed up to the jet, settling in there. “Close your eyes. You look like you barely slept today and we have a few hours.” My uncle patted my head before he sat across from me and opened his laptop.

“Work?”

“Work.” He nodded. 

“This summer, can you teach me some stuff?” A plan was forming in my mind, a plan not only to keep myself free from my pathetic mate, but one that would make me a lot of money.

“Of course, Sugar.” My uncle smiled up at me. “You know, your dad would teach you just about everything he could if you were open to it.”

“I asked to move to your pack.” I snuggled into the blanket the flight attendant handed me, and Ronnie froze.

“What is going on?” His eyes flashed.

“I’ll explain later. Just promise you will try to believe me and not judge me.”

“Of course, Sugar.” He smiled and then turned back to the laptop on his lap. “Now get some sleep.”

“Will do.” I turned away and fell asleep almost instantly. 

I woke up to Ronnie shaking me. “We are here.” 

I gave an enormous yawn and cracked my jaw before wiping my eyes. “Okay.” I handed off the blanket and wiped my face again. “Thank you.”

“No problem, Princess.” The flight attendant smiled down at me, and I realized belatedly that she was from the pack too.

“You don’t have to call me Princess.”

“You are the Alpha’s daughter.” She bowed and then left us to our own devices. 

“Come on, your dad has already linked me three times since landing.” Ronnie laughed and whisked me off to the waiting car. With in thirty minutes we were at our pack lands. “You dad would allow you to move here if you wanted to, Sugar.”

“I know. But Alpha Vince won’t allow me to leave…” I looked over and blew out a breath. “I think he assumes something I am running from and won’t let me leave until he knows for sure.”

“You going to tell me yet, Sugar.”

I hesitated as we pulled up out front of the pack house. Before I could answer the door was ripped open and I was surrounded by powerful arms and a smell that made my quaking insides settle.

“Dad.”

“Hey my pup.” His deep voice calmed me further, and I could feel my eyes prickle.

“I’ve missed you.” I sniffled as he unbuckled my seat belt and I was in his arms fully.

“As I have missed you.” He kissed my temple. “Now we have much to discuss.” He was running with me before I could utter another word, with Ronnie following behind. 

“Slow down, jack ass. Some of us can’t move that fast.” Ronnie struggled to keep up and my laughter filled the halls of the pack house. We settled in my father’s office with an out of breath Ronnie, who was scowling. God, I missed these two.

“Tell me what’s wrong, pup.” I looked around and still I stumbled over my words. My father grabbed my face and shook his head. “Nothing you tell me will change anything, pup. I believe you, no matter how crazy it seems.”

“Agreed Sugar.”

My insides settled when I saw how resolute he was. He would believe my craziness. I could tell no matter how crazy my story was, my father and Ronnie would believe everything I said. 

I never had to second guess if I was going crazy here.

So finally I settled fully and told my story.

Chapter 5

“I lived another life, and I died.” I stumbled over my words and I felt my father freeze. A quick look to Ronnie had him locking the door and waving his hands. I felt the air still, but I was focused on my father’s eyes. “This morning I woke up six years in the past after living until I was twenty-four, and growing my own pup only to have my mate to rip him from my body.” My father’s and Ronnie’s snarl shook the walls, but I raised my hands. “He betrays me for my step sister who convinced him that I cheated and the pup wasn’t his, so he killed us both using silver scalpels, and killing any love I had for him at the same time.” I looked up at my father and the tears rolled down my face.

“Pup.” His voice was choked up, but I raised my hand. 

“I don’t want him to be my mate, daddy. I know I won’t survive it. I need to change it. Everything, and it starts with hiding my scent. I told mom what I needed, and she called you. How are you going to help me?” I was starting to panic. “I don’t want to die. I don’t want my pup ripped from my stomach only for him to smell himself on him. I don’t want to create life just to have it ripped from me daddy. I can’t.” My soul was ripping and even though I want revenge, this was the first time I was given to truly grieve the lost of my pup. 

“Sugar.” Ronnie’s voice was barely a whisper and then I felt my father lose control.

“Who?” His voice was pure darkness front he depths of hell. His fist slammed into the desk, creaking the thick wood, and I looked up to find my father’s wolf looking back at me. “Who hurt you, my pup? Who killed my grand pup?” Loki’s voice was deeper than I had ever heard and his eyes promised retribution. 

“Brandon, the alpha’s son.” I whispered the final piece and everything seemed to click. The air rushed back in and my father’s wolf shifted into his black form. I screamed and Ronnie dove in front of the door.

Loki snarled, but Ronnie held firm. “You can’t go kill him for something that hasn’t come to pass yet, Loki. You know how this works. You have been through it yourself.” But Loki just snarled. 

“Daddy, please.” I begged. I knew if he got out, Brandon and Shannon were dead and the council would be on his doorstop. Loki whirled on me and softened at the devastation he saw n my face. He padded over and licked the tears from my face before going back behind the desk and shifting again. 

“I’m sorry Amy, I lost myself for a moment.” He opened a door and slipped into some shorts. He wiped at his face before he sat back down. “I guess its are turn to come clean.”

“Daddy?” I sniffled and looked up at him. 

“I’m not just a wolf, although, as you can see, Loki is very much a part of me.” His laughter was weak, but I just smiled. “My mother was a shaman of our people, a witch, and my father had to have her. Even if it was just for a night. And I was born.”

“A witch?” I dropped my hands, and he just had a small, sad smile. 

“Yeah. You would have loved her, but witches don’t live like us. They have the lifespan of a human, a flash in the pan. She was gone long before I met your mother.” He shook his head. “One of her powers was exactly what you explained, a second chance. The moon goddess passed us down with the same powers. I had mine when I was your age as well.”

I jolted back as he nodded. “What?”

“I never cheated on your mother.” His words were soft. “I alpha commanded a wolf to pretend I did when she came to me and told me she was with pup. You see, in my first life, I stayed with her and we had three wonderful pups, but one night, my enemies attacked and the four of your were all murdered.” His swallow was thick.

“Daddy.” 

“I couldn’t lose you, not all of my pups, so when I woke up four years in the past, I acted. You were just a babe. I never got your brothers or sister, which broke me for a time. But I had you.” He swallowed back his tears as I reached his side. “I told you, mother I betrayed her.”

“She said she felt it.” 

He nodded slowly. “When a wolf betrays their marked mate, the mate feels the worse pain imaginable.”

“Yes, he does.” Ronnie growled out and I darted my eyes back to his face and I realized something. 

“Mom and Morgan.”

“It doesn’t happen often enough to make a big deal out of it.” My dad growled out.

“But it happens enough that you feel the pain.” Ronnie growled out.

“Mom doesn’t know.” I wrapped my arms around my father. “She wouldn’t ever if she knew.”

“I know, princess, but you can’t tell her. I’m sure I passed the fate, since I made it past my death…but now, now it would break her to find out the truth.” My dad squeezed me. 

“So she felt you take another female?” I hugged him back, but he just shook his head.

“I used my power to fake the pain. She was crying inside of our room, and I was in the next room, breaking my own heart.”

“Daddy?”

“It was losing her and you, or losing everything. And I knew I would still get to see my little girl.” My dad pulled back. 

“But anyway, I didn’t tell you so you would feel bad for me, but to know that you have power too. Power to hide your scent, at the very least. But I will teach you how to wield it this summer.”

“Thank you, dad.”

“Don’t thank me yet. This summer will probably be the worst you have ever had, but it will save you in the long run.”

“Once everything is done, I need you to promise me something, daddy.”

“What is it, pumpkin?” My dad always called me new nicknames when he was worried. 

“After I have done what I need to do, we are going to tell mom the truth.”

“Baby, we can’t.”

“She is stronger than you think. And she never moved on. She only got with Morgan because she thought I needed a male’s protection in the new pack. And she didn’t like the attention she was getting from the Alpha.”

My dad growled and hit his desk again and then nodded. “Fine. We will tell her.”

“Thank you, daddy.” I kissed his cheek.

“Now go get settled, we will start tomorrow morning, but I know a certain someone who is pounding down the pack house doors to try to see you.”

I smiled and shook my head. Cassie was my best friend and soul sister. Meeting when we were babes was the first step in our soul bond. “Cassie?”

“Has been champing at the bit as soon as she heard you were coming, so go see her.”

“I love you two.”

“And we love you, sugar.” Ronnie kissed my head. “I’d kill your alpha mate if I could.”

“You would start a war.” I shook my head and left with a last hug from my dad.

Chapter 6

I walked to my room and screamed when I was tackled to the ground. I started laughing as Cassie got off me. “Why the heck didn’t you tell me you were coming?” She punched my shoulder as I stood. 

“I didn’t know until this morning.” I hugged her to my side. “I missed you.”

“I missed you too.” She pulled back and tossed me a small box. “Happy birthday.”

I laughed again. “With everything that has happened, I had pretty much forgotten that it’s my birthday today.” 

“The big eighteen. Have you shifted yet?” Cassie jumped up and down with excitement. 

I just shook my head. “I don’t shift. You know that.” My face fell. I heard chuffing inside of my head. 

“I think you are just blocking it. You have a wolf. We all feel her.” She bumped her hip into mine. “I can feel she wants out.” My wolf chuffed in agreement.

Cassie is smarter than you. My wolf’s voice ricochetted in my mind and I just smiled. There are things I cannot tell you, even now, but eventually, if we are lucky, you will find out your answers.

I rolled my eyes. Yet another non answer from Nix, my wolf. She snorted back to me and then receded into the back of my mind.

“Nix still not answering you?”

“She is, but it’s more of her non answers.” I grabbed my bag and opened it up. “You will never guess what happened today.”

Cassie flopped on my bed. “Tell me everything.”

I opened my mouth to tell her I lived before and my father’s voice sounded in my mind. Baby girl, I know you might want to tell Cassie what happened with your first life, and I understand the need, but don’t tell anyone yet. You can’t seal their tongue and our heritage is dangerous.

Okay, dad. I won’t.

I love you. Then his voice was gone and I had to reorganize my thoughts.

“Tell me.” Cassie threw a pillow at me and I shook my head. 

“I think the alpha’s son is my mate, and so does Shannon. She lost her ever loving mind, and was stealing my clothes so that he would pay attention to her.” I shook my head in disgust. 

“She was trying to steal your mate?” Cassie’s eyes flashed. 

“She can have him. I don’t want or need her sloppy seconds. Even if she hadn’t already fucked him, which I am sure she has, I wouldn’t have wanted him. He is mean and vindictive. And just…small.”

“Like small, small?” Cassie held her finger and thumb close together and shot her eyes to the apex of my thighs and I bent over laughing, tears springing to my eyes as she joined in. 

“I have no idea.” I wiped my eyes after I calmed down. “Nor do I want to. I just mean even as an alpha, he gives off small man energy? I don’t even know how to explain it exactly. Just that even when he is pushing his alpha aura, I feel nothing, not even a little bit, not even a fraction of what my dad does.”

I sat down on my bed. “And you don’t want to be with a mate that is weaker than you?”

“No, it’s not that.” I shook my head. I wasn’t explaining it right. “I know that if given an excuse, he would betray me. His devotion would be weak, just like his aura.”

“Ah. Now I understand.” Cassie rolled on to her back and huffed. “That would be the absolute worst thing. I don’t know how your dad is dealing with the pain.” She shot her eyes to me and grimaced.

“Did everyone here know the truth?”

Cassie shook her head. “No, but once you guys left, and the Alpha never stayed with the she-wolf. With any she-wolf, we figured something was wrong, and then the wolf was born and we could all smell the girl’s mate on the pup, and we knew they lied. We just don’t know why.” Cassie rolled over. “Do you know?”

I nodded. “My dad told me the truth today when I told him I wanted to reject my mate.”

“Well, this is just depressing. Let’s go out and do something?” Cassie sat up and I just shook my head. “C’mon.” 

“I have training in the morning and my dad said it was going to be brutal.” 

“So you can’t go out today? Bull. Get up. We are going shopping and then I will parade you in front of everyone to make them jealous that my best friend is the Alpha’s daughter.”

I perked up. “Has anyone been giving you issues here?” Cassie shook her head, but I could see someone had. “Cass?”

She huffed and then nodded a little. “Just a few she-wolves that think their shit doesn’t stink and have a higher rank.” Amanda and her little posse, I could only assume.

“Do they give you a lot of trouble?”

“Only a little.” She just grabbed my arm and pulled me to the door. “Enough of them, I don’t care. I just missed you, and I want to parade around with my best friend.”

“Deal.” I couldn’t say no to her when I knew she was being bullied. Cassie was weaker than me, but then again, everyone was. But she was sweet and had been by my side since birth. Her mom and my mom used to be best friends. “But you need to point out who is bullying you.”

“No way. I can handle it.”

“I know you can, but you shouldn’t have to.” I could feel Nix coming closer to the surface. My anger was already rising.

“You aren’t here enough.” Her whisper had me pulling her to a stop. “I don’t mean to make you feel bad, but you aren’t here enough to start something with them for me. Because it will only get worse once you leave again.” She looked back at me with sad eyes. “So, can we just drop it?”

I nodded my head but swore to myself that I would figure out this situation. “Let’s go have some fun. Parade me all you want. I’m here all summer.” I smiled and pushed the Amanda bullshit to the back of my mind. I would handle her as soon as I could.

Chapter 7

When we got to the mall, we walked into the clothing store. “I need a new dress.” Cassie pulled me to the back and started to go through the racks. 

“Why do you need one of these dresses?” I pulled a dress off the rack and held it to my body. The form fitting dress flared out at the bottom. It was a beautiful mermaid formal dress, but white wasn’t my color. 

“Your homecoming ball.” Cassie grabbed a short pink number that would look horrible with her skin tone. 

“Put that down and what do you mean homecoming ball?” Cassie froze and then slow turned back to me.

“Don’t tell your dad I told you.” She rushed back to me and grabbed my hands. “Frick, I knew I was going to mess this up. You are my best friend and I knew I would mess this up.”

“Calm down.” I laughed. “I would never tell my dad you messed up.” I wrapped my hands around her shoulders and shook. “Cassie, calm down and just tell me.”

She smiled and nodded. “I was supposed to take you dress shopping for a surprise home coming party tonight. You know your dad.”

“I do. Which is why I shouldn’t be surprised.” I smiled and then forced the pink dress out of her hands. “But this, this needs to go back and you have to promise me you will never touch it again.” I put it back on the rack. I started to go through the dresses and pulled a pale golden sheath dress that would look absolutely amazing on her. “Here try this on.”

“I don’t know Amy.”

“Listen to you best friend.” I pushed her back toward the change rooms and then I looked through the rack of myself. I was blissfully window shopping when I heard a voice that made my hackles rise. 

“Take it off now.” I could feel the power in the tone and then I heard Cassie’s sweet voice waiver.

“You aren’t supposed to command another wolf. You aren’t in a position to demand anything from weaker wolves.” Cassie’s voice sounded pained.

“Well then, take off the fuck dress and I wouldn’t.” Nix was in a full rage as I rounded the wall and saw Cassie being held face first into a wall with snarling red headed she wolf behind her with her cronies.

“And why would she do that?” I pushed my hand outward and checked my nails as fear scented the air.

Slowly the she-wolves all turned and then finally Amanda turned with a sweet smile. “Amy, welcome back.” I lifted my lip at her.

“Why are you touching Cassie?” I smiled at her slowly. “Specifically, why are you trying to take a dress I picked out for her?”

“You picked this dress? It’s amazing.” I nodded. 

“I know. That’s why I picked it out. It matches Cassie perfectly.” I walked over and pulled Cassie away from the crowd of women. “Let me look at you.” I saw the fear in her eyes, and Nix snarled. No one touched our friend. Cassie’s wolf, Nora, was a timid brown wolf that Nix took a liking to. “You’re stunning. This is the dress.”

“Wait.” Amanda walked over next to us. “I saw this dress on Cassie and thought that it clashed with her usual style.”

“And you thought it would look better on you?” I smirked as Amanda tried to stare me in the eye and failed. I felt her aura punch up a notch, and Cassie whimpered. “Well, too bad. We had it first.” I tried to handle this without the pissing contest, but Amanda punched up her aura again.

Cassie whimpered and looked at me. “I can pick a different dress. It’s okay.” She turned to take the dress off, and I saw a flash of triumph on Amanda’s face.

“No. If you don’t want it, I’ll buy it for myself. I picked it up first. So it’s mine. Amanda, you understand, don’t you?” I smiled down at the other she wolf and I could scent her frustration. 

“Okay Amy. It’s yours.” Cassie smiled at me before hustling back to the change room and taking off the dress before handing it to me. “Did you have anything you wanted to try on?”

“No, I am just going to buy these two dresses and we can go look at jewelry.” I smiled over at the huddled group of women. “I hope you guys find a dress for tonight.” Then we left.

Once we were out of earshot, I let out the snarl; I was holding. The air rumbled between my lips and Cassie ducked her head. A little bit of my aura leaked, and I felt guilty, but I was livid. 

“Don’t be mad, Aim.” Cassie grabbed for my arm and I watched her eyes flinch when she saw Nix’s golden eye staring back at her. ",1,1749549488.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I think it might be quite uneasy for people who know a book is smut to spot someone reading it in public.

I also thought I'd ask here instead of the normal actuallesbians because I'm 26 and would value some more mature perspectives if possible. 

I'm a very busy person at the moment and moved to a new city about a year ago but I started to want to put myself out there and date again or at least have some fun - I hadn't been intimate with anyone since a good friend with benefits moved abroad early last year and I hadn't dated romantically in even longer. I went on a couple of tinder dates last month - one was with a girl who, whilst nice, I knew on the first date would not be romantically compatible or on a wavelength with me. The next was with a girl who I really enjoyed talking to and chilling with over coffee and who I was very open to seeing again (and vice versa). We've now been on two proper, civilised dates and also met up at my city's Pride, at which we had a lot of fun, both got incredibly drunk and then hooked up (I know). We got breakfast together the next morning and parted ways. This all happened over the course of about a month. 

It's starting to feel more ostensibly a Thing now (her friends who got breakfast with us are talking and joking like they expect I'll be around for a while, she's inviting me to events happening months away etc) so I feel like we need to have a talk next time we hang and know where we stand. Trouble is I'M not sure where I stand. I like and admire her as a person but we don't know each other that well yet and haven't talked about anything especially deep, and I don't really have butterflies or pine after her or anything yet. I'd like to keep seeing her and figure it out but I've been led on before and I don't want to risk doing the same to her. But I also don't want to end things in a panic early on when she seems like one of the nicest people I've dated so far (admittedly the bar is low). I've done that in the past too and regretted it later. She is DEFINITELY someone I could see being in my life long term if she'll have me, I just don't know if that's as a friend or a partner yet.  

I guess things feel too normal for me? Normally at this stage of seeing someone I either feel really scared and suffocated because they want to u-haul and I want to run for the hills, or I feel desperately yearning and invested because I'm so attracted to and interested in them and they don't seem to care if I live or die. In this case I like her and enjoy her company but feel like things could still go either way, and we don't talk or see each other with the kind of frequency that would stress me out (we message maybe once a day if that and it's mostly to plan our next meeting). I keep reading stuff like ""you should be sure after three dates"" but like...I'm not? Is that okay? Needless to say I plan on communicating this to her and having a talk about what page she's on when we next hang, but...How long is too long to be unsure? Is there a 'normal'?

I’m a 22 year-old guy based in London, and I’m here to build real, long-term friendships - the kind that ideally includes meeting up in person eventually. I think it’s hard to form genuine bonds without shared experiences beyond a screen.

If you're just messaging out of boredom or likely to ghost after a day, feel free to skip this post as I’m looking for meaningful connections, not quick chats.

Who I’m hoping to connect with:

Aged 18–25

Based in the UK (even better if you’re also in London or nearby)

Open to eventually meeting in person - whether it’s for coffee, concerts, or just to hang out


A bit about me:

⚽ Football fan — I play weekly
🤘 Big into rock & metal — always down for gigs
🎮 Gamer — mostly into single-player games across genres
🎬 Into Marvel and all things nerdy
🏎️ I love go-karting and visiting theme parks
🧠 Neurodivergent — emotionally aware, open-minded, and a good listener

What I’m not looking for:

One-word replies

Inconsistent or low-effort conversations

Surface-level chats with no intention of building something real

What I am looking for:

People who want real connection and are willing to put in effort

Comfortable with chatting regularly, maybe gaming or voice calling

Open to hanging out or doing things in person down the line


If you’re messaging me, please include your age, gender, location, and a bit about yourself, just to show you actually read this and want to connect.

Thanks for reading.

I’d really like to meet a few solid, like-minded people.",1,1749548487.0,MakeNewFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

So I didn't.","This happened at my old job where our manager loved being overly strict just to feel in control. He was one of those ""rules for the sake of rules"" kind of guys. Always micromanaging, always watching the clock.

A few months into the job, he called a team meeting, not to appreciate our work, not to solve a problem, but to make an announcement:

""From now on, if you're late by even one minute, don't bother coming in at all. We need discipline around here.""

We all looked at each other, half confused, half amused. It sounded ridiculous, but he was serious. No grace period, no context, no questions asked.

Fast forward a few weeks. One morning, I got stuck in traffic due to an unexpected road closure. I did everything I could rerouted, skipped my coffee stop, even ran the last block to the office. I ended up arriving 3 minutes late.

So I didn't badge in. I turned right back around and went home.

About 30 minutes later, I got a call from my manager. He sounded angry and confused.

""Where are you? Why didn't you come in?""

## Key Features Analysis

The best huge ice cube trays of 2025 offer a combination of durability, ease of use, and versatile functionality.

**Material Quality:** High-quality silicone or durable plastic are the most common materials used in these trays.Silicone offers flexibility, making it easier to remove the ice cubes, while durable plastic provides a rigid structure that resists cracking or breaking. Trays made from BPA-free materials are essential for ensuring the safety of your ice cubes.

**Cube Size and Shape:** The size and shape of the ice cubes can considerably impact their melting rate and visual appeal. Common shapes include squares, spheres, and even novelty shapes. Larger cubes melt slower, keeping your drinks colder for longer, while unique shapes add a touch of elegance or fun to your beverages.Cube sizes typically range from 1.5 to 2.5 inches in diameter or width.

**Tray Design and Construction:** The design of the tray plays a critical role in its ease of use and longevity. Trays with reinforced edges are less likely to warp or bend when filled with water. Some trays come with lids to prevent spills and protect the ice cubes from freezer odors. The number of cube cavities also varies, allowing you to choose a tray that produces the right amount of ice for your needs.

**Ease of Use and Cleaning:** The tray should be easy to fill, transport, and remove the ice cubes from. Flexible silicone trays make it simple to pop out the ice cubes without needing to twist or bang the tray. A smooth surface also makes the tray easier to clean, either by hand or in the dishwasher.

 Food-grade silicone or BPA-free plastic construction
 Large cube capacity (1.5-2.5 inches)

## Core Benefits

Using a huge ice cube tray offers several notable benefits compared to using standard-sized ice cube trays.

**Slower Melting Rate:** The primary benefit of large ice cubes is their slower melting rate. This is due to their smaller surface area relative to their volume. Slower melting means your drinks stay colder for longer without becoming diluted as quickly, preserving the flavor and integrity of your beverage. Such as, a large ice cube in a glass of whiskey will keep it chilled for a significantly longer time than several smaller cubes.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** Large ice cubes, especially those with unique shapes, add a touch of elegance and sophistication to cocktails and other beverages. A perfectly clear, spherical ice cube can elevate the presentation of a drink, making it more visually appealing. This is particularly vital for entertaining guests or creating a special experiance.

**Versatile Applications:** Huge ice cube trays aren't just for making ice. They can also be used to freeze herbs in oil or water, make frozen baby food portions, create popsicles, or even freeze coffee for iced coffee. Their versatility makes them a valuable tool for various kitchen tasks, helping you to portion and preserve ingredients in a convenient and organized manner.

**Reduced Freezer Burn:** The larger size of the ice cubes also makes them less susceptible to freezer burn compared to smaller cubes. This means they can be stored in the freezer for a longer period without losing their quality or becoming unappetizing due to sublimation. This is particularly useful if you don't use ice as frequently.

## FAQs Section

June 2025
Dear Colleagues,

I don’t know what kind of GPU-induced coma I was in, but apparently I closed my laptop in late 2019 and just woke up. I thought I’d get a coffee and debug a GPT-2 hallucination. Instead, I found the world debugging reality itself.

You said we were 30 years from AGI.
It’s been six.

What. Happened.

Back in My Day…

We were so proud of GPT-2’s ability to spit out a half-coherent short story about “unicorns in the Andes.”
We debated whether 1.5 billion parameters was too big.
We argued about whether language models could “understand” anything.

We scoffed at the idea they could reason. Or plan. Or replace lawyers.

I mean… they couldn’t even keep track of a story for 5 sentences.

Now?
	•	You’re telling me GPT-4 passed the bar exam, the SAT, and writes code better than your juniors?
	•	People are using ChatGPT as a therapist, professor, startup co-founder, and lawyer?
	•	You talk to it in real-time now—and it talks back… with emotions?
	•	And OpenAI made a model that can “see,” “hear,” and “reason”—at once?
	•	There’s an AI arms race between nations, companies, and Discord users?

WHAT THE HELL DID YOU FEED THESE THINGS?

Also… WHAT IS A “GPT-4o”?!

Is that a typo?
Did we go through GPT-3.1, GPT-3.5, 4.0, 4.1, and 4.∞ while I was gone?

Worst of All…

You mean to tell me we didn’t solve alignment, but deployed this anyway?
That there are actual debates about whether AGI is already here—and someone might’ve just buried the news?

You let models simulate humans, write legislation, coordinate drones, and run companies…
And then said: “Don’t worry, it has guardrails.”

Guardrails?
I left you with unicorns. You gave them keys to the nuclear codes.

Final Questions:
	1.	Where’s my old job? (Replaced by AI.)
	2.	Who’s president? (It’s… complicated.)
	3.	Can I go back to 2019 now?

Please?

Sincerely,

Me having the worst credit out of the 3 of us should i apply along with them or would it be better to stick to the plan and have them 2 apply only? 


how likely would a landlord overlook our credit if we were to pay 2 or 3 months of rent upfront. is it frowned upon to offer that ? 

Would you guys recommend trying to reach out to privately owned apartments rather than going for the property management owned buildings?

Was going through a stressful and anxiety filled time and turned to cigarettes in nov. Then went to vaping around Feb or so. I use a geek bar pulse and that usually lasts me 7-8 days. I've tried cold turkey on a Tuesday and had to buy another vape because I'd wake up after a few hours with anxiety in my chest and couldn't sleep. I can handle it for most part during thr day but at night it's a different story. I need my sleep as I drive commercial explosive trucks and cant be tired. 

Yesterday I forced myself to wait a bit and I was managing the anxiety but last night around 7pm it was too much and had to go upstairs to have a few puffs of my almost dead vape. I've realized im gonna need to taper and use a patch to fully quit. What strength would you recommend? I usually puff 5-10 times every hour from 4am- 10pm when I go to bed. Wofes quitting too and is supportive. I've been trying regular gum for the oral fixation and it seems to help but cant stop the chest anxiety (which I assume is my craving). No other cravings really. 

Last night I bought a new one to get me through week until I can try to stop at fri. Gonna.leave it at home and only allow puffs in morning,  when i get home(1pm) and b4 bed. 

I smoked for about a month a year or so b4 starting again and was able to stop. Smoked weed in my 20s for a few years and quit cold turkey with any issues.  Haven't drank pop, onlyn2 cups of coffee a day and water. 

So im looking at doing a patch starting today or tomorrow and taper off instead of waiting on patch to do it alone. ",1,1749547203.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False

Add in rent, books, food, and surprise fees, and suddenly, you're staring down debt before you’ve even picked a major.  
But there are ways to cut your costs and make college way more affordable. Here are a few tips to help students keep costs in check 👇

1. **Apply for ALL the Financial Aid** 💸 Grants, scholarships, and state aid are out there, you just have to dig a little. Start with your school’s financial aid office, talk to your counselor, and check out niche scholarships.
2. **Rethink Housing** 🏠 If staying at home is an option, that’s a huge savings win. If not, living with roommates or even becoming a resident advisor (RAs often get free or discounted housing) can save you thousands.
3. **Get a Flexible Campus Job** 💼 Universities usually offer part-time gigs that work around your class schedule. Whether it’s working in the library or helping out at events, it’s a solid way to earn while you learn. 
4. **Graduate On Time (or Even Early)** ⏳ The longer you stay, the more you pay. Stay on top of your course requirements and avoid unnecessary classes to finish within four years and keep your costs down. 
5. **Buy Used, Borrow, or Share** 📖 Textbooks and supplies add up fast. Look for used options, rentals, or split costs with a friend when you can.

Try to make a budget. List everything: tuition, rent, food, books, transport, even coffee runs. Once you see where your money is going, it’s way easier to spot where you can reduce the costs.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of the optimal 32 oz drink container hinges on several critical features that directly impact user experience and satisfaction.

**Insulation Performance:** This refers to a container's capacity to sustain the temperature of its contents over a specific duration.A High-quality 32 oz insulated bottle, such as, should keep beverages cold for up to 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours.This is typically achieved through double-walled vacuum insulation, where a vacuum layer minimizes conductive and convective heat transfer. critical metrics include temperature retention curves measured under controlled ambient conditions, demonstrating the container's performance under various environmental stresses. The quality of the vacuum seal and the types of materials used influence the overall performance.

**Material durability:** Reflects the container's resistance to physical damage from drops, impacts, and general wear and tear.

Stainless steel grade (e.g., 18/8 or 304) signifies the composition and resilience, where higher grades offer increased corrosion resistance.Tritan plastic, a BPA-free choice, is known for its shatter resistance and clarity. Testing methods often involve controlled drop tests from varying heights onto different surfaces to assess impact tolerance and structural integrity. A durable finish, such as powder coating, further enhances scratch resistance and grip.

**Lid and Closure Design:** Focuses on the ease of use, leak-proof nature, and hygiene considerations related to the container's opening mechanism.

Features includes threaded lids, flip-top caps, straw systems, and push-button mechanisms. Ideal designs ensure a secure seal, preventing leaks even when the container is inverted or subjected to movement. The lid material, frequently enough BPA-free plastic or silicone, plays a crucial role in hygiene and cleaning. A wide-mouth opening facilitates easy filling and cleaning, while integrated carry handles or loops add to portability. Leak testing under pressure and repeated opening/closing cycles determine the reliability and longevity of the lid closure system.

**Portability and Ergonomics:** Considers the container's dimensions, weight, and handle design, all of which contributes to its suitability for carrying and handling.

optimal dimensions are crucial to compatibility with standard cup holders and backpack pockets. Lightweight materials, such as Tritan or thin-walled stainless steel, minimize the burden during transport. Ergonomic features, such as contoured shapes or textured grips, enhance user comfort and control. The design and placement of handles, loops, or clips allows for convenient attachment to bags or belts. Weight distribution and center of gravity are essential considerations for stability when placed on surfaces.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:** Centers on the ease with which the container can be cleaned, disinfected, and maintained over time, ensuring hygienic use.Smooth interior surfaces, wide-mouth openings, and dishwasher-safe components simplify the cleaning process. Antimicrobial coatings or treatments further inhibit bacterial growth, promoting hygiene. Some containers feature removable components, allowing for thorough cleaning of all parts. Material compatibility with various cleaning agents and resistance to staining or odor retention are critical factors. Regular maintenance,such as gasket replacement,may be required to maintain optimal performance over time.

1l7tyno,https://i.redd.it/9o9cj9r0f26f1.png,AI-Powered Customer Retention: An Overview of Techniques for Long-Term Engagement,"In today’s fast-paced world, businesses thrive not only by attracting new customers but by keeping existing ones engaged, satisfied, and loyal. Retaining a customer is far more cost-effective than constantly trying to acquire new ones, and loyal customers, those who feel seen and understood-are the very backbone of a sustainable brand. They not only spend more over time, but they also help spread the word about your business and reinforce a strong reputation in the marketplace. However, with endless options vying for attention and customers’ ever-changing needs, forging lasting relationships demands a deliberate mix of insight, genuine care, and well-crafted strategies.

At its heart, lasting customer loyalty arises from understanding people at a personal level. It requires knowing what motivates them, anticipating their needs before they even become apparent, and delivering value in a way that feels authentic and uniquely tailored. Companies that build these human-centric relationships turn one-time buyers into lifelong partners. Over the next sections, we’ll delve into essential techniques for maintaining customer engagement over time and explore practical, real-world examples of how businesses can make every interaction count.

**1. Personalization: Making Every Customer Feel Valued**

One of the most fundamental ways to build loyalty is through personalization. Everyone enjoys feeling special—whether it’s receiving a thoughtful birthday note with an exclusive discount, discovering product recommendations that align perfectly with past purchases, or simply getting a heartfelt thank-you message that acknowledges one’s individual choices.

Imagine visiting your favorite local boutique where the owner remembers your style preferences or your preferred fabrics. This level of personal attention is what many customers crave but rarely experience in larger retail chains. Corporations today aim to recreate that warm, one-on-one interaction on a larger scale, ensuring that every customer feels like they matter.

Take streaming services as an example. They often “curate” a selection of movies or shows that align with previous viewing habits, much like a trusted friend who knows your taste in books recommends a new novel. Similarly, online retailers present products or hint at new arrivals that mirror your past interests. The purpose isn’t to bombard you with random offers but to provide choices that resonate with what you love. By consistently addressing individual preferences, companies build an emotional connection that turns casual shoppers into devoted fans.

This approach goes beyond simple demographics it involves a thoughtful process of keeping detailed records of past interactions, understanding the nuances of customer preferences, and crafting messages that feel like a genuine conversation. When a customer sees an offer that truly speaks to their needs, the effort behind it becomes evident, deepening their trust and respect for the brand.

**2. Anticipating Customer Needs: A Proactive Approach**

Have you ever experienced a moment when you almost switched brands or cancelled a subscription, only to be pleasantly surprised by a timely outreach from a company? This type of proactive engagement is the result of businesses monitoring usage patterns and customer behaviors so keenly that they can step in before a minor concern grows into a major deal-breaker.

Consider the case of a meal kit service. Perhaps you’ve noticed that, after a few weeks of trying to keep up with a busy schedule, you begin to skip deliveries. A smart provider might detect this change in habit not by chance, but by carefully tracking engagement and then reach out with a personal suggestion: perhaps an introduction to a pre-prepared meal option or even a flexible delivery schedule that better fits your lifestyle. Such thoughtful intervention not only addresses an immediate need but also reassures customers that their convenience matters.

Subscription-based platforms regularly observe user activity to determine when interest wanes. For instance, if a once-active user’s activity begins to taper off, a well-timed email offering an exclusive feature or a limited-time discount can serve to reengage them before they consider leaving entirely. This proactive approach is about more than just preventing churn; it’s about consistently adding value at critical junctures in the customer journey. When people feel that a business is genuinely invested in their satisfaction, they naturally develop a deeper connection with the brand.

The secret to success here lies in careful observation and empathy. Companies that excel in this area are like attentive hosts they notice when a guest seems less comfortable and take steps to make them feel welcome again. By anticipating needs, businesses not only safeguard their customer base but also create ongoing opportunities to strengthen the relationship.

**3. Reliable Support: Being There When It Matters**

It’s said that nothing beats outstanding customer service, and no area exemplifies this more clearly than the support a company offers. In a world where technical glitches and service interruptions can occur at any hour, a responsive and understanding support team becomes paramount to customer loyalty.

Imagine a scenario where you experience a problem late at night perhaps with a new product or a service glitch and you’re met with a support team that is not only prompt but also empathetic. A real person guiding you through a solution step by step can transform a potentially frustrating ordeal into a positive experience. This reliable, accessible support creates a sense of security. Customers know that troubles will be addressed without lengthy waits or impersonal responses. Whether through live chat, phone calls, or email, timely help makes all the difference when you need it most.

But excellent support isn’t solely reactive. Forward-thinking businesses also adopt a proactive mindset by following up on customer experiences regularly. After a purchase, a simple check-in asking if everything is to your satisfaction or if there’s anything more that could enhance your experience can signal that the relationship extends beyond the point of sale. Even periodic newsletters with troubleshooting tips or hints to make the most out of a product drive home the idea that the brand stands by its customers.

Ultimately, dependable support builds confidence. It tells customers that the company not only cares about selling a product but is invested in ensuring that every customer enjoys an optimal experience every step of the way. When companies make themselves accessible, it adds a personal touch that inspires trust and loyalty.

**4. Understanding Customer Sentiment: Listening to the Voice of the Customer**

Conversation is the heartbeat of any strong relationship, and this holds true between businesses and their customers. What customers say whether in reviews, social media posts, or direct communications provides invaluable insights into their true feelings. Many companies have learned that to truly nurture loyalty, they must not only listen but also act on this feedback.

Consider a customer who leaves a mixed review or a candid social media post. Rather than brushing off such comments, an effective business will analyze the sentiment behind the feedback. Is there an undercurrent of frustration? Perhaps a touch of disappointment masked by politeness? Understanding these nuances can help a business take swift, tailored action. For example, if someone shares a negative experience publicly, an immediate, sincere response accompanied by appropriate compensation can transform discontent into gratitude and loyalty.

Moreover, positive feedback is just as powerful. When customers broadcast their positive experiences, companies can build on that momentum by reaching out for testimonials or facilitating word-of-mouth referrals. It is the authenticity of customer voices that lays the foundation for real trust. Customers are not simply data points; they are the individuals whose opinions have immense influence over new prospects and the overall brand perception.

A truly customer-centric approach means constant listening and learning. It means periodically analyzing the emotions conveyed through customer interactions and adapting strategies accordingly. Whether through organized surveys, spontaneous social media engagement, or community events, businesses that keep their ears open end up not only solving problems quickly but also pre-empting potential issues before they fester.

**5. Rewarding Loyalty with a Personal Touch**

A meaningful loyalty program can serve as a gentle reminder to customers that their patronage matters. Yet, not all rewards are created equal. Generic ""buy more, save more"" schemes often fall flat compared to tailored incentives that consider each customer’s unique habits and preferences.

Picture a local coffee shop that surprises a regular with a free latte after several visits. Or imagine an online bookstore that sends a discount on a new release from a favorite author—these are not just transactions; they’re thoughtful gestures that speak directly to the customer’s interests. Such personalized rewards programs demonstrate that businesses are constantly thinking about the people who keep them going.

Effective loyalty programs are built on the foundations of relevance, timing, and exclusivity. When a customer receives something unexpected and perfectly aligned with their interests—whether it’s in the form of points, discounts, or early access to new products—it elevates the everyday experience into something memorable. Moreover, these well-calibrated rewards signal that the business values not only the sales but also the relationship underlying every purchase.

The beauty of personalized rewards lies in their flexibility. Beyond one-time offers, companies can develop tiered programs that evolve as the customer’s relationship grows. A new customer might start with small perks, and as their engagement deepens over time, they gain access to higher tiers of rewards. This gradual enhancement of benefits reinforces the customer’s decision to stick with the brand, as each step forward is celebrated with a reward that feels both earned and exclusive.

**6. Engaging Customers Through Well-Timed Interactions**

In a world buzzing with distractions, timely and thoughtful interactions become crucial. People have busy lives, and small reminders can serve as subtle nudges that keep a brand top-of-mind without overwhelming the individual. The art of well-timed engagement is about striking a balance—ensuring that customers feel gently guided rather than harassed with excessive communication.

Consider an online shopper who adds a product to their cart but walks away before completing the purchase. A friendly follow-up email that appears within a few hours, perhaps with a modest incentive or additional product information, can remind them of what they left behind and encourage timely completion of the order. Similarly, if a customer hasn’t interacted with a mobile app for a while, a well-crafted push notification announcing a new feature or exclusive offer can recapture their interest. These small, considerate touches show customers that the business is mindful of their habits and eager to enhance their experience.

However, there is always a fine line between staying relevant and being intrusive. Successful engagement strategies rely on understanding customer preferences—when they’d appreciate a reminder and when they might prefer silence. Businesses that master this art pay close attention to feedback, adjusting the cadence and content of their communications accordingly. In doing so, they create a rhythm of interaction that feels natural and respectful, rather than mechanical or overbearing.

When executed correctly, such well-timed interactions become a testament to the company’s attentiveness. They illustrate that every customer is valued enough to merit personalized outreach at just the right moment—a gesture that builds a reliable, ongoing relationship.

**7. Tailoring Strategies to Different Customer Groups**

Not all customers are the same, and a one-size-fits-all approach can lead to missed opportunities. Successful businesses appreciate that their customers come with varying needs, preferences, and degrees of engagement. Segmenting the customer base into groups based on behavior, spending habits, or interests can help create messages that strike a more personal chord.

For instance, consider a fitness brand that caters to diverse demographics—from beginners taking their first steps into a workout routine to advanced athletes looking for specialized training. Newcomers might appreciate friendly motivational tips, beginner-friendly workout plans, and gentle encouragement, while seasoned enthusiasts may look for more challenging routines, exclusive events, and advanced health insights. By tailoring communications to these distinct groups, a brand can ensure that everyone feels both understood and supported.

This segmentation isn’t confined solely to a fitness brand. Retailers, travel companies, and even financial services can benefit from recognizing the unique subgroups within their customer base. A travel agency might have one group of adventure seekers while another might consist of customers seeking comfort and luxury. With targeted messaging, promotions can be crafted so that each group receives offers and content that truly resonate with their lifestyle and interests. This approach not only increases engagement but also reinforces the value of the customer’s time and trust.

Understanding the diverse nature of one’s customer base involves periodic revisits to the strategy. By analyzing purchase histories, feedback patterns, and usage trends, companies can adjust their segmentation over time, ensuring that each subgroup evolves with the business and receives communications that are always relevant.

* **Overcoming Challenges and Maintaining Ethical Practices**

While thoughtful engagement strategies can nurture customer loyalty, they must be balanced with ethical considerations. Today’s customers are increasingly conscious of how they are treated not just in terms of product quality but also regarding data privacy, fairness, and transparency. Trust is built not only through personalized attention but also through ethical practices that respect the customer’s autonomy and privacy.

For example, while personalized communications may delight customers, transparency about how personal details are gathered and used is essential. A well-regarded business openly communicates its policies and ensures that customers feel in control of their personal information. With an emphasis on clear opt-in and opt-out options, companies can honor customer preferences while maintaining the quality of service expected from a modern brand.

Additionally, although streamlined systems for engagement can provide efficiency, businesses must also preserve the human touch. Over-reliance on any automated process may result in responses that feel cold or mechanical. Customers may become frustrated if they feel they are interacting with a machine rather than a caring representative. Therefore, it is crucial to balance operational efficiency with genuine, heartfelt service—one that shows empathy, understanding, and readiness to help.

Fairness is another cornerstone. Reward systems, special offers, and customer segmentation must be designed to avoid any sort of bias. An inclusive approach ensures that no segment feels marginalized or overlooked. By being vigilant about ethical practices and continuously seeking feedback, companies cement their reputation as trustworthy partners earning the respect and loyalty of a diverse customer base.

* **The Future of Customer Engagement**

Looking forward, the landscape of customer engagement promises to evolve even further. Although the core fundamentals trust, timely support, personalized interactions, and ethical practices—will remain unchanged, businesses can expect to see fresh innovations and evolving methodologies that add richness to this relationship.

Imagine a future where deeper insights into customer behaviors allow companies to predict needs almost intuitively, resulting in even more seamless interactions. New forms of digital communication, such as immersive experiences or voice-based interfaces, could offer customers a more dynamic and interactive experience. Yet, the emphasis will always be on enhancing the human connection. Technology will serve as an additional tool—a means to understand and connect with customers on a more nuanced level, but without ever replacing that personal, genuine interaction.

In this future scenario, businesses might also leverage enhanced community-building strategies. Customer forums, interactive webinars, and local events could bring together like-minded individuals, fostering both brand loyalty and a sense of belonging. Whether it’s a small business gathering supporters in a local community hall or a global brand hosting virtual workshop, the continual emphasis remains on making every customer feel like an essential part of a larger family.

* Ultimately, the foundation of strong customer retention continues to be built on trust, responsiveness, and a deep appreciation for each individual. Companies that invest thoughtfully in understanding their customers, responding to their needs with care, and maintaining ethical practices will always be remembered not just as service providers, but as partners in their customers’ lives.

Im in a process to manifest back my sp, a better version of him as well as of myself. Last night, I suddenly woke up at 4:30 am and checked my instagram only to see he posted a video of him being out and having fun with his friends 30 minutes prior. I tried to let it go, get back to sleep but I couldn’t. Anything I tried I couldn’t go back to sleep and got so upset and frustrated with everything that I started crying. Sometimes I can’t help but feel so upset about the fact that he’s always out having fun with his friends every night, being distracted while I stay inside drowned in my own thoughts, worrying about him. And so I was crying hysterically, I was feeling so exhausted, so upset and I was talking to myself about how frustrating he is and how this process of manifestation is because, even though I’m so grateful for all the signs I already received (I have another post on that), it seems like all the signs are when we see each other at school but when we don’t, sometimes I don’t feel anything at all and summer break in one week away and we’re not going to be seeing each other. 

At some point, I fell asleep at 6:30 am, still crying but I was able to calm myself down a little. This morning I woke up at like 10 am feeling pretty good, calm and relaxed. I made some coffee and went on with my day feeling okay. Not amazing, just okay. 

Sometimes I can’t shake off the feelings when I realize he’s literally having fun w his friends all the time bc he has a really nice and stable friend group while I’m thinking about him and if he’s okay and stuff.

Should I be concerned?,"Posting on my alt since husband knows my main. Extremely long post so strap in!!

I (27F) have been with my husband (27M) for almost 8 years, married for 3. Let’s call him Liam (fake name). Prior to our relationship, Liam was with Danielle (28F, also fake name). Liam and Danielle met in high school and were extremely close friends before they decided to start dating. They dated from the end of their senior year of high school to the end of their freshman year of college. They were a lot of firsts for each other, including sex for the first time. According to Liam, Danielle was the first girl he was ever truly in love with. He did anything for her, including driving over 2 1/2 hours to and from his college to her college every weekend their freshman year (they went to schools in different states) so they could spend time together. Things started to change for them during the later parts of their freshman year of college after Danielle got heavily involved with a religious group on her campus. According to Liam, she got very manipulative and emotionally abusive. She had these new ideas in her head of who she was wanting him to be and wanting to “save him”. He tried going to church with her and doing the things she wanted him to do but it eventually led to him becoming confused, upset, and ultimately resentful which led to them ending things in a crash and burn type way. 

Fast forward several months after they breakup, Liam meets me. We started casually dating at first since he still had trauma and large amounts of trust issues that remained from his relationship with Danielle. After about 5 ish months, he felt like he was ready for something serious again. 3 1/2 years later, we’re engaged. Another year goes by, we’re married. Almost 3 years later, we’re here today. Throughout all of this time, Liam has not heard from Danielle once. Also during this time, Danielle has met someone new, gotten married as well, and currently has a young child.

Flash to a week and a half ago. Liam and I just moved to a new house closer to our hometowns and posted about the move on social media. After seeing the post, Danielle decides to message Liam congratulating us on the new place and hoping that all is well. Nothing too crazy but not something that he was expecting. They begin briefly conversing about house things, moving, renovations, etc. Liam tells me she reached out to him and I find this a bit odd but nothing to worry about. A couple of days later, Liam sits me down to ask me something and for me to “not freak out”. I, of course, begin freaking out. Apparently, Danielle had continued to message him after their brief conversation and eventually sent him a long post letting him know that there are some things she wants to get out in the open, wants to deeply apologize for the way she treated him towards the end of the relationship, and wants to do all of this in person with him. He asks me my opinion on this and I’m definitely concerned as to why after all this time this is something she feels the need to do and also why the need for this to be in person. After discussing this with a friend who had a similar thing happen to her and afterwards the ex left them alone, I ultimately agreed hoping that the same scenario would play out with us. Boy was I wrong.

Liam and Danielle decide to meet at a coffee shop in a town about halfway between where we live and where she and her husband live. For Liam, it was about an hour drive. This meeting took place this past Saturday. At first, I asked to come with and just sit in the car while they talked since I anticipated it being a short but awkward conversation where she could express what she needed to and then he could leave and we could go do something afterwards. Liam convinced me I would end up being bored and he would feel bad leaving me alone for that time so it was better for me to just stay back. He didn’t think it would last very long, maybe an hour or so, and he would be home before I knew it. I ended up agreeing and he left early in the morning so he could meet her around 10. After letting me know once he got there and that he would keep me posted on when he would be heading back, I waited. After about an hour, I texted asking how it was going and he said it was fine and that he was just listening to what she had to say. Another hour goes by and I start feeling a bit concerned as I would have thought they would be done by now. Another hour goes by and I’m full on irritated. I text him saying it’s been three hours and ask when I should expect him back. He lets me know they’re catching up and he would let me know. ANOTHER hour goes by. Four hours in total and I’m mad. What was supposed to be a short apology conversation was turning into a full day thing. Finally, he lets me know he’s heading home after 4 1/2 hours of them talking. I needed answers.

When he finally got home, I asked what happened. He lets me know that Danielle did apologize for the way she treated him during their relationship. After that, they began catching each other up on their lives since it had been nearly 8 years since they last talked. It was a good, casual conversation and then she started breaking down crying. According to Liam, Danielle is at her wits end in her marriage is considering divorcing her husband. She told Liam that her husband hasn’t been the man she thought he would be and that they have lost all passion in their marriage. That it got harder after she had their baby and doesn’t know what to do since she doesn’t really like the idea of starting over and navigating as a single mom. Basically, she was confiding in him about all of the issues in her life and he sat and listened and talked with her. Liam said she really just needed someone to listen that wasn’t involved in their circle. He felt bad for her and just wants to make sure she is okay. He then asked me how I would feel if they continued to be casual acquaintances. I told him I could maybe get to a point where I would be comfortable with that, but would needed to think about it.

He made it seem like that was the end of what they discussed and we continued the rest of our day as normal. At the end of the day, we get in bed and are watching TV when I notice that he’s getting quiet and distant. I ask what is wrong and he starts to tear up saying that there was more he needed to tell me about him and Danielle’s conversation. I, immediately, get worried. In tears, he tells me that Danielle expressed to him that she still has feelings for him. Even though it’s been years and they’ve both moved on, she still has parts of her heart set for him. That her husband “isn’t half the man he is”. In some ways, I wasn’t shocked to hear that especially since she wanted to meet with him after all this time. However, what he said next did shock me. He told me that after talking with her, he realized that he also still has some unresolved feelings for her. All this time, he thought she hated him after they broke up when in reality she was just struggling with her religious trauma in college and took things out on him when she shouldn’t. Everything was took out of context. I didn’t know what to think. He was so hurt and torn apart after they broke up and it took me months to build his trust and hope back up in the beginning to allow him to see himself capable of love again. Now all these years later he says he still has a part of his heart for her. In many ways, I understand because first love will always hold a spot. But I’m also a bit hurt that my husband, the man I plan to spend the rest of my life with, still feels for his ex.

After learning that she still has feelings for him, I told him I wasn’t liking the idea of them still talking. That she could eventually start interpreting his kindness to her wrongly and see some sort of potential between them. That really she should be discussing her marital issues with her own husband and not him. He insists that she would never come between us and that Danielle herself even expressed that she respected the idea of marriage whole heartedly and the last thing she would want to do is harm ours. He wants to be there for her because it seems like she doesn’t really have anyone else to talk to about all of this. 

Last night, he was showing me TikToks on his phone when a text notification from Danielle popped up. I questioned him about it and he shrugged it off as nothing. Today, I asked if she was still texting him and he said she was but he was trying to slowly cut her off. I expressed again how I don’t think it’s best for him to be talking to her and how she really should be going to a friend or family member to talk about her issues. I noticed he was still texting her throughout the evening tonight too.

Should I be concerned about all of this? I don’t want to come across as a wife who controls who her husband can or cannot talk to. I do trust my husband but I don’t really know Danielle. He insists she is true to her word and would never try anything but how can I know for sure? My best friends think I should tell him to block her. I don’t think he will because he feels bad for her. But I don’t want her to continuing to reach out to him for validation and that eventually leading to her feelings towards him growing more. What do I do? Please help.



TLDR: My husband’s ex girlfriend reached out to him after almost 8 years to apologize for the way she treated him. They spent time together catching up and she told him about how her own marriage is falling apart and doesn’t really know what to do. She’s been confiding in him for a few days now. Learned that there is also unresolved feelings on her end and my husbands end. Told my husband I didn’t like the idea of her coming to him for validation especially if she has feelings. He says she would never try anything. They are continuing to talk. Should I be concerned?",4,1749545770.0,Marriage,12,0.83,False

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a suitable wood slab coffee table hinges on several key features that define its aesthetic appeal, structural integrity, and long-term durability.

**Slab Dimensions:** The dimensions considerably influence the table's usability and aesthetic suitability for a particular space. A standard 48-inch slab provides ample surface area for everyday use, accommodating drinks, books, and décor items comfortably.larger slabs exist, offering greater visual impact, but may overwhelm smaller living rooms.

**Wood species:** Different species of wood exhibit distinct characteristics, affecting the color, grain pattern, and overall look. walnut, such as, offers a rich, dark tone with swirling grains. Maple offers a lighter, cleaner look with subtle patterns. The species influences the table’s wear resistance, with hardwoods like oak and maple being more resistant to dents and scratches.

**Finish:** The finish applied to the wood slab protects the surface and enhances its natural beauty. Options range from matte to high-gloss, each affecting the table's visual impact and maintenance requirements. A matte finish showcases the wood's texture,while a glossy finish adds a touch of elegance.Oil-based finishes penetrate the wood, providing protection and a natural look, while polyurethane offers a more durable and water-resistant surface.**Base Material and Design:** the base dictates the table's stability and complements its overall style. metal bases, either sleek and modern or rustic and industrial, offer strength and a contemporary aesthetic. Wooden bases provide a more traditional and cohesive look. The design can range from simple geometric shapes to intricate carvings, impacting the table’s overall aesthetic.

**live Edge vs. Straight Edge:** A live edge retains the natural contours of the tree from which the slab was cut, adding an organic and unique element. A straight edge offers a cleaner, more modern look and enhances the table's practicality.The choice between thes two depends on personal preference and the desired style.

**Moisture Content:** The moisture content of the wood is critical. It can vary widely depending on how the wood has been dried or treated, which means its susceptible to expansion and contraction leading to possible cracking and warping. Purchasing from a company that kiln-dries its wood is a solid choice.

Key features of a high-quality wood slab coffee table include:

* Durable and attractive finish
* Sturdy and complementary base

**How do I care for my wood slab coffee table to prevent damage?**
Regular dusting with a soft cloth helps prevent scratches and maintain the finish. Avoid placing hot or wet items directly on the surface, instead use coasters and placemats. Occasional polishing with a furniture polish designed for wood keeps the finish looking its best.Avoid direct sunlight, which can fade or damage the finish over time.

**What types of wood are best suited for a coffee table slab?**
Hardwoods like oak, walnut, maple, cherry, and ash are highly recommended due to their durability and resistance to wear. Softwoods like pine and cedar are less suitable for high-traffic areas but might potentially be appropriate if given proper coating and care. The choice depends on your desired aesthetic, budget, and the level of maintenance you are willing to provide.

**what are the common causes of cracking in wood slabs, and how can I prevent them?**
fluctuations in humidity and temperature are the primary causes of cracking in wood slabs. Wood expands and contracts with changes in moisture levels, leading to stress that can cause cracks.Maintaining a stable indoor environment by regulating humidity levels, especially during dry winter months, can help prevent cracking. Additionally,choosing a kiln-dried slab that has been properly seasoned reduces the likelihood of moisture-related issues.

**Can I customize the finish or shape of my wood slab coffee table?**
Many manufacturers and artisans offer customization options for wood slab coffee tables, allowing customers to select their desired finish, edge profile (live edge or straight edge), and base design. Some even offer the option to choose the specific slab from their inventory. Customization allows you to create a truly unique piece that perfectly matches your style and space.

I’m planning to relocate  from Vilnius to Vienna with my family (wife and daughter) in early August. I’m currently looking for both job opportunities and a place to live, so any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

A bit about me:
– 29 years old, male
– Speak Lithuanian and Russian fluently, good command of English, and currently learning German (A1 level). (I know that B2 would be great, but I do my best now)
– Almost 7 years of experience as a bartender, and some experience as a barista in a coffee shop
– Tech-savvy: confident working with Windows, macOS, and Linux
– Know how to build responsive websites with clean HTML/CSS, understand basic JS
– Some basic video editing skills, familiar with Adobe programs and Figma
– Fast learner, responsible, and open to any job where I can be helpful
– No bad habits

A question about housing:
How realistic is it to find a rental apartment in Vienna without an Austrian salary and without a large amount of savings to prove financial stability? Are there any ways around this, or tips on how to approach the housing market in this case?

Thanks in advance for any advice or leads!",0,1749544985.0,wien,14,0.36,False
1l7tnlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l7tnlq/i_20f_finally_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_20m/,I (20F) finally broke up with my boyfriend (20M) after two years. His mom (54F) said I’m “not family anymore” and treated my things like trash. I’m emotionally drained and just need to vent.,"
Hi Reddit,
I’m not sure where to begin because there’s so much pain and frustration bottled up. But I’m finally out of a two-year relationship with my now-ex (let’s call him john, 20M), and even though I’m the one who ended things, I’m the one who’s left feeling disrespected and emotionally exhausted — not just by him, but also by his mother, Mara (54F).


A few days ago, we (my friend, my brother and his girlfriend) went to pick up some of my stuff from the apartment we used to share. I asked them not to touch my belongings before I came to pack everything myself especially my valuable collectible figures and my art supplies. But instead of respecting that, John and his mom just threw everything into random bags and moved it without my input.

Some of my figures got damaged. My art stuff was all mashed together. My canvas might be ruined. When I asked Mara why they touched my things, she dismissed me and said, “Well, we packed everything neatly.” (Spoiler: they didn’t.)

When I told her how upset and disrespected I felt, she literally told me:
“You can’t expect Julian to change or start cleaning. That’s just how he is. If you can’t handle that, you need to find a different man.”
And also said 
“It’s good that u look at your feelings, but do you think it’s ok for John if ur stuff is there.” 
Our break up wasn’t even 24h ago they didn’t leave any chance to gather my stuff under normal circumstances.

When I pointed out that I’m still a person and I deserve respect, she said:
“Well, you’re not part of this family anymore.”

Mara calls herself religious and a Christian, but can’t even treat people with respect. 

She also removed me from all their family group chats without a word and when I asked her why they wouldn’t even let me say bye to the others she told me, “You can still message them privately. You’re just not in the group because I didn’t want you there.”

I was speechless. Not even a chance to say goodbye.


John wasn’t abusive, but he was emotionally immature, lazy, and manipulative in subtle ways. Here’s just a fraction of what I experienced over two years:

I felt like his mom, not his partner. I cooked, cleaned, did laundry, organized everything 
he did almost nothing unless I explicitly asked.

He never made me coffee unless I asked five times. Even when I hinted (“I’m so tired, I could use a coffee…”), he just ignored it.

He’d only clean when I got angry or after a fight to make himself look better.

I constantly felt like I was the one *fighting* for our relationship.

When I brought up that I was feeling mentally unwell, his response was, “Now I feel bad because it’s my fault,” and that was the end of the conversation. No follow-up. No care. Just guilt-tripping.

I have asthma and heart issues. 
On a hike, he didn’t even look out for me, and then afterwards when i told him that it hurt me because it felt like he doesn’t care about me, he said “But u didn’t take care of me too!” like that made it okay it was so manipulative.  He is a healthy young man. When I told him that he can’t compare himself to me, he said “I am not immortal”

I self-harmed. He never once asked if I was okay. Never once checked in. Not once.


Even when I gave him space 
I encouraging our mutual friend Mike(20M) and his   friend fin (23M) to check on him 
He didn’t return the gesture. 
When Elena (20F) my best friend called him (after the breakup to ask if he knew where I was because she was worried about me, cause didn’t answer my phone, he just said, “No idea,” and hung up.

Like I could’ve been dead, and he wouldn’t care.


He always said he was afraid I’d leave, but he never did anything to make me feel wanted or supported. He didn’t change. Not after multiple talks. Not after tears. Not even after I told him how much pain I was in.

He said things like:

“I’m scared you’ll just break up with me.”
“I don’t know how I’ll handle it if you leave.”

But never:

“I want to grow for you.”
“What can I do to support you?”
“How can I make you feel loved?”

Everything felt like it was about his fear and never about our connection.


Even after all this, I tried to be respectful. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I kept saying I’d come pick up my stuff and still, they treated me and my things like garbage.

And when I told his mom that, she kept talking about how he was the victim. That he was hurting. That he had done everything for me.

Really? Is that why, when I needed rest or space, he got moody because I didn’t immediately want physical affection? Or why he would guilt-trip me if I asked for basic hygiene (like not cuddling in dirty clothes after I showered)? Or why he’d joke about my personal habits in front of friends and share private stuff?

I don’t hate him. I don’t think our relationship was a waste. I learned a lot mostly about my own boundaries. I let him get away with too much for too long. I excused things I shouldn’t have. I prioritized him over myself constantly.

And I still hope he learns something from this. Maybe in a year, he’ll grow and reflect. Who knows?

But right now? I had to go.

Because if I stayed, I would’ve kept shrinking myself. And I deserve better than that.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I just needed a place to share it all not to bash anyone, but to finally breathe.🖤

TL;DR:
I (20F) broke up with my boyfriend (20M) after two exhausting years where I felt more like his mom and maid than his partner. He rarely put in effort, manipulated me emotionally, and never supported me during my mental health struggles. When I went to pick up my stuff, his mom (54F) had already packed it carelessly, told me I “wasn’t part of the family anymore,” and removed me from all their group chats. I’m heartbroken, not because I still want the relationship, but because I gave so much of myself for so little in return. I finally chose myself.

#### Welcome to the Spanish Nomad Dream

Spain. Sun-drenched plazas. Tapas at midnight. Wi-Fi strong enough to power your wildest ambitions. The siren song for digital nomads is loud, intoxicating, and—finally—within reach. The world’s wanderers have eyed Spain for years. Now, Spain’s doors are swinging open.

#### The Digital Nomad Visa: Spain’s Game-Changer

Spain’s digital nomad visa isn’t just a stamp in your passport. It’s a seismic shift. A formal invitation to live, work, and play in the land of flamenco and fiestas—legally. Spain, once a fortress of bureaucracy, is rolling out the red carpet for remote workers. Welcome to the revolution.

*🌍 Ready to see if you qualify as a digital nomad?* *[Try the free Nomad Income Detector now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Who Spain Wants: Eligibility Decoded

Spain’s not looking for just anyone. They want the digitally untethered, the globally ambitious. If you’re a non-EU citizen with a remote job or business, you’re in the running. Spain wants proof you’re the real deal, not a sun-chasing slacker.

#### Nationalities That Can Apply

Most non-EU/EEA nationals can apply. Americans, Canadians, Australians, Brits—Spain’s arms are open. If you’re from a country that’s not on the naughty list, you’re likely eligible. But check the fine print; Spain’s rules are precise, sometimes maddeningly so.

*🔥 Want to know if your income stacks up?* *[Find out instantly with the Nomad Income Detector!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Remote Work: The Non-Negotiable

Remote work isn’t a buzzword here—it’s the golden ticket. You need to prove you work for a company outside Spain or run your own remote business. No local contracts. No sneaky side gigs for Spanish firms. Spain wants your tax euros, not your competition.

#### Self-Employed vs. Employed: Who’s In?

Freelancers, rejoice. Employees of foreign companies, step forward. Both camps can play—if you can prove your remote status. The catch? Your clients or employer must be based outside Spain. No loopholes, no exceptions.

*💡 Wondering if your job qualifies for nomad life?* *[Diagnose your digital nomad potential in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Income Thresholds: Show Me the Money

Spain isn’t running a charity. There’s a minimum income threshold—think €2,000+ per month, but check the latest figures. The higher your income, the smoother your ride. Spain wants to know you won’t be couch-surfing or freeloading off the system.

#### Proving Your Financial Stability

Bank statements. Pay slips. Contracts. Spain’s bureaucracy wants receipts. The more proof you have, the less they’ll question your nomadic legitimacy. Prepare to over-document. Paranoia is your friend.

*🌟 Still unsure if you make the cut?* *[Test your digital nomad income instantly!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Paperwork: The Bureaucratic Gauntlet

Spain’s love affair with paperwork is legendary. You’ll need: a valid passport, proof of remote work, bank statements, health insurance, a clean criminal record, and more. Each document, stamped, signed, and apostilled. Miss one? Back to the queue.

#### The Spanish Love for Apostilles

Apostille. The word alone can trigger nightmares. It’s an official stamp that proves your documents are legit. Without it, your paperwork is just expensive confetti. Get familiar, get organized, get apostilled.

*🚀 Take the guesswork out of your nomad journey.* *[See your digital nomad income potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Application Process Unmasked

You can apply at a Spanish consulate in your home country or, if you’re already in Spain, at a local immigration office. Fill out the forms. Submit your dossier. Wait. The process isn’t swift, but it’s doable. Expect a few months from start to finish.

#### Timeline: From Dream to Reality

Patience, grasshopper. Processing times vary, but three months is a safe bet. Sometimes faster, sometimes slower. Bureaucracy moves at its own pace. Don’t book your flight until you see that shiny visa sticker.

*🌍 Unlock your digital nomad future in Spain!* *[Check your income potential in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Taxes: The Elephant in the Plaza

Spain’s taxman is no joke. If you spend more than 183 days a year in Spain, you’re a tax resident. That means global income, global headaches. Plan for this. Get advice. The taxman always rings twice.

#### Double Taxation: Friend or Foe?

Spain has treaties with many countries to avoid double taxation. But don’t trust the system blindly. Get a pro to check your situation. The right paperwork can save you thousands. The wrong move can haunt you for years.

*🔥 Ready to maximize your nomad income?* *[Diagnose your earning power now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Family Matters: Bring Your Tribe

You’re not alone? Good news. Spain lets you bring your spouse and kids. But each dependent needs their own paperwork, their own proof of funds, their own apostilles. Family adventure, bureaucratic edition.

#### Requirements for Dependents

More forms. More money in the bank. More apostilles. Spain wants to know you can support your whole tribe, not just yourself. Prepare for a paperwork marathon.

*💡 Curious about your family’s nomad potential?* *[Check it in under 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Health Insurance: No Room for Risk

Spain won’t let you in without private health insurance. Public health is for residents, not nomads. Your policy must cover you for the entire stay, with no gaps. No insurance, no visa. Simple as that.

#### Spanish Health System Quirks

Spain’s healthcare is world-class, but you’ll be outside the system—unless you go full resident. Choose a global insurer with a reputation for paying claims. Read the fine print. Don’t gamble with your health.

*🌟 Don’t leave your health—or income—to chance.* *[See your digital nomad income potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Where to Live: Urban Pulse or Seaside Chill

Madrid for the hustle. Barcelona for the buzz. Valencia for the sweet spot. Seville, Malaga, the islands—each offers a different flavor. Rents range from “that’s reasonable” to “are you kidding me?” Choose wisely.

#### Cost of Living Breakdown

Spain is cheaper than most of Western Europe, but costs are creeping up. Rent, food, transport—budget €1,500 to €3,000 per month for comfort. Live like a local, not a tourist, and your euro stretches further.

*🚀 Ready to calculate your nomad budget?* *[Diagnose your income potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Coworking, Community, and Connection

Spain’s nomad scene is exploding. Coworking spaces everywhere. Meetups, masterminds, rooftop parties. You’ll find your tribe—if you look. Don’t isolate. Spain’s magic is in the people.

#### Top Coworking Spaces

From WeWork to indie gems, Spain’s got options. Fast Wi-Fi, free coffee, networking events. Try a few before you commit. The right space can turbocharge your productivity—and your social life.

*🌍 Find your ideal coworking city—and income level!* *[Check your digital nomad potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Visa Duration: How Long Can You Stay?

The digital nomad visa usually grants one year, renewable up to five. Play your cards right, and Spain could become your forever home. But miss a renewal deadline, and you’re out.

#### Pathways to Permanent Residency

After five years of legal stay, you can apply for permanent residency. The Spanish dream, made real. But you’ll need to prove you’ve played by the rules—every year, every step.

*🔥 Ready to plan your long-term nomad journey?* *[See your income potential instantly!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Pitfalls and Power Moves

Common mistakes? Missing documents. Underestimating processing times. Ignoring tax obligations. Power moves? Hire a local gestor. Over-prepare. Make friends at the consulate.

#### Insider Hacks for a Smooth Process

Start early. Double-check everything. Use a checklist. Ask questions. Bureaucracy rewards the relentless and punishes the lazy. Be relentless.

*💡 Want a shortcut to nomad success?* *[Diagnose your digital nomad income now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Alternatives: When the Visa Says No

Rejected? Don’t panic. Spain offers other options: non-lucrative visa, student visa, entrepreneur visa. Each has its quirks. If you want Spain bad enough, there’s always a way.

#### Plan B for the Persistent

Persistence beats resistance. If you’re denied, regroup. Learn. Reapply. Spain’s not going anywhere. The dream is still alive.

*🌟 Don’t let rejection stop you—find your path.* *[Check your income potential today!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Legal Landmines: Stay Out of Trouble

Don’t overstay. Don’t work for Spanish clients. Don’t skip taxes. Spain’s rules are strict, but clear. Break them, and you’re out—no second chances.

#### Compliance Tips for Digital Nomads

Stay informed. Laws change fast. Join expat forums. Hire a pro if you’re unsure. Protect your dream with vigilance.

*🚀 Stay compliant, stay free—know your income power!* *[Diagnose your digital nomad income now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Spanish Work-Life Alchemy

Work hard, siesta harder. Spain invented work-life balance. Don’t fight it. Embrace the rhythm—late lunches, long walks, spontaneous fiestas. Productivity isn’t just output; it’s joy.

#### Cultural Integration Secrets

Learn Spanish. Eat late. Say yes to invitations. The more you lean in, the richer your experience. Spain rewards those who play by its rules—and break a few with style.

*🌍 Ready for the Spanish way of life?* *[Check your digital nomad potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Future of Nomad Visas in Spain

Change is constant. Spain’s digital nomad visa will evolve. Stay alert. The early adopters win big—the latecomers play catch-up. Don’t wait for perfection.

#### Spain’s Vision for Digital Nomads

Spain wants your energy, your ideas, your euros. The digital nomad visa is just the beginning. The future? More flexibility, more opportunity, more adventure.

#### Your Nomad Launch Checklist

Passport? Check. Visa? Check. Insurance? Check. Laptop, charger, backup drive? Double check. Pack light, pack smart. Spain rewards the prepared.

#### What to Pack (and What to Leave Behind)

Bring what you can’t replace. Leave what you can buy in Spain. Essentials: adapters, unlocked phone, patience. Leave the baggage—literal and metaphorical—at home.

So far -

•	⁠I love the easier maintenance.

•	⁠I have to get used to the different shape - the smooth bottom part is not as easy to hold when attaching both pieces. I prefer the original shape of the classic aluminium moka.

•	⁠for anyone wondering, Venus 4tz holds the same amount of coffee as Moka Express 3tz (which I am very happy about!) but slightly more water (?)

The coffee is really good. However, a little more „watery”. I am not sure what is the main reason or if it’s a combination of factors. I started to use a little less water and it helped. But I also had to change the settings on my grinder to the finest grind possible. This helped a lot too. The water still pours through rather fast and I think the coffee might be just a little underextracted.

1l7thvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TicketToEverywhere/comments/1l7thvg/best_hotels_in_amsterdam/,Best Hotels in Amsterdam,"The gentle lapping of canal water against centuries-old stone walls. The aroma of fresh stroopwafels drifting through your hotel window. The soft golden light filtering through tall, narrow glass panes as Amsterdam awakens. These are the moments that transform a simple hotel stay into something magical, and trust me, I've learned this through years of exploring every corner of this enchanting city.

I still remember my first Amsterdam hotel disaster – a cramped room above a noisy pub where the walls were so thin I could hear every conversation in Dutch. But that experience taught me something invaluable: in a city as special as Amsterdam, where you stay doesn't just affect your comfort; it shapes your entire experience. The right hotel becomes your gateway to understanding this captivating city's soul.

# Why Your Amsterdam Hotel Choice Shapes Everything

**Amsterdam isn't just another European capital** – it's a living artwork where every neighborhood tells a different story. The cobblestone streets beneath your feet, the bike bells chiming at dawn, the way morning light dances across canal water – all of these experiences begin the moment you step out of your hotel door.

During my dozen visits to Amsterdam, I've stayed everywhere from luxury canal-side suites to quirky converted bridge houses. What I've discovered is that Amsterdam hotels aren't just places to sleep; they're integral to how you'll experience the city's rhythm. Choose wisely, and you'll wake up to the gentle sounds of canal boats and cyclists. Choose poorly, and you might find yourself in a tourist trap miles from the magic.

The city's unique geography means that staying in the right neighborhood can save you hours of travel time and unlock hidden local experiences that most visitors never discover.

# The Crown Jewels: Amsterdam's Most Luxurious Hotels

# Canal-Front Elegance: Where History Meets Opulence

**The Toren** sits like a jewel on Keizersgracht, one of Amsterdam's most prestigious canals. I'll never forget stepping into their **Golden Age-inspired lobby** – it felt like walking into a Vermeer painting. The scent of polished wood and fresh flowers immediately enveloped me, while morning light streamed through tall windows, casting intricate shadows across marble floors.

What makes The Toren extraordinary isn't just its **authentic 18th-century wall paintings** (though they're breathtaking), but how they've preserved the intimate feeling of a grand Amsterdam canal house. When you open your window in the morning, you're greeted by the gentle sounds of water lapping against the canal walls and the distant chime of church bells – it's pure Amsterdam poetry.

**Pulitzer Amsterdam** offers a completely different luxury experience. Spread across 25 interconnected 17th and 18th-century canal houses, it feels like staying in a charming village within the city. Their **famous courtyard garden** – the largest private garden in central Amsterdam – becomes a serene oasis where you can escape the bustling streets while remaining in the heart of everything.

# Modern Sophistication Meets Dutch Design

The **Conservatorium Hotel** redefines luxury for the contemporary traveler. Located directly across from the Van Gogh Museum, this design masterpiece combines sleek modern aesthetics with Amsterdam's cultural heritage. I spent an entire morning in their **Akasha Holistic Wellbeing Center**, a 1,000-square-meter spa that felt like a hidden sanctuary beneath the museum district.

What struck me most was how the hotel's **floor-to-ceiling windows** frame the Museumplein like living artwork. You're literally waking up to views of world-class culture, and the **museum pass they provide** means you can explore Amsterdam's artistic treasures without planning or waiting in lines.

The newest addition to Amsterdam's luxury scene, **Rosewood Amsterdam** has quickly become the talk of canal-side conversations. Their rooms feature those coveted **direct canal views** that make every morning feel like a scene from a Dutch Golden Age painting.

# Boutique Treasures: Hotels with Soul and Story

# Historic Charm Reimagined

**The Dylan** occupies a special place in my heart. Built in the ashes of a 17th-century theater that was destroyed by fire, this boutique gem feels like staying inside Amsterdam's artistic history. The **award-winning restaurant** is housed in an original 18th-century bakery, where you can enjoy French cuisine while surrounded by exposed brick walls that have witnessed centuries of Amsterdam life.

Each room tells its own story through carefully curated Dutch design elements. The **thick copper-colored curtains** and vintage books create an atmosphere that's both sophisticated and wonderfully cozy – what the Dutch call ""gezellig.""

# The Most Unique Stay in Amsterdam

Nothing prepared me for **SWEETS Bridge Houses** – Amsterdam's most innovative hotel concept. These aren't traditional hotel rooms; they're **converted historic bridge operator houses** scattered across the city's canals. Each tiny house was once home to the bridge operators who manually opened Amsterdam's drawbridges for passing boats.

Staying in a SWEETS house means you're not just visiting Amsterdam; you're living within its infrastructure. I spent three nights in Bridge House 022 on Homomonument canal, where I could watch boats pass by my window while brewing coffee in my own tiny kitchen. The **authentic canal views** are unmatched because you're literally positioned on the water, surrounded by the gentle sounds of lapping waves and passing cyclists.

Each bridge house is designed by **Studio Space&Matter** with modern amenities while preserving historical character. You get a tablet loaded with neighborhood information, Netflix for cozy evenings, and the extraordinary experience of living like a local in one of Amsterdam's most unique accommodations.

# Smart Mid-Range Choices: Quality Meets Value

# Museum Quarter Favorites

**Hotel Aalders** has earned its reputation as a **Museum Quarter favorite** through consistent quality and an unbeatable location. Walking to the Van Gogh Museum takes exactly four minutes (I've timed it), while the Rijksmuseum and Stedelijk Museum are equally accessible. The **complimentary breakfast buffet** features authentic Dutch cheeses and fresh-baked bread that fills the morning air with irresistible aromas.

**Jan Luyken Amsterdam** offers boutique-style comfort at mid-range prices. Their **uniquely styled rooms** feature bold statement pieces and pops of color that reflect Amsterdam's creative spirit. Some rooms offer **direct canal views**, making it feel much more expensive than it actually is.

# City Center Accessibility

**NH Collection Amsterdam** positions you perfectly for exploring both cultural attractions and Amsterdam's famous **Flower Market**. The hotel's modern design contrasts beautifully with the historic city center, and their **efficient tram connections** mean you can reach any neighborhood within 15 minutes.

The **Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam** provides classic elegance near Central Station. Their **spacious rooms** (a rarity in Amsterdam) and helpful concierge services make it ideal for first-time visitors who want professional guidance for exploring the city.

# Budget-Friendly Gems That Exceed Expectations

Smart budget travelers don't have to sacrifice location or comfort in Amsterdam. **Hotel Espresso** proves this perfectly – despite its budget-friendly pricing, you'll enjoy a **prime city center location** with easy access to major attractions and **efficient public transport** connections.

**Hotel Estheréa** offers family-friendly accommodations without breaking the bank. Their **various room configurations** make them perfect for traveling families, while their central location means attractions, restaurants, and shops are all within walking distance.

What I love about Amsterdam's budget hotels is how they embrace the city's **cozy Dutch atmosphere**. Even the most affordable options often feature charming details like exposed wooden beams, canal views, or traditional Dutch design elements that make your stay feel authentically Amsterdam.

# Choosing Your Perfect Amsterdam Neighborhood

# Canal Ring: Classic Amsterdam Romance

The **UNESCO World Heritage Canal Ring** offers the most iconic Amsterdam experience. Staying here means waking up to **17th-century architecture** and the gentle sounds of canal boats beginning their daily routes. Hotels like The Toren and Pulitzer Amsterdam are positioned perfectly for romantic canal walks and easy access to Amsterdam's finest restaurants.

The morning light on canal water creates an ever-changing display of reflections and shadows that photographers dream about. Evening brings a magical transformation as historic buildings illuminate and canal bridges sparkle with lights.

# Museum Quarter: Culture at Your Doorstep

For art lovers, staying near **Museumplein** is unbeatable. You can visit the Van Gogh Museum before crowds arrive, enjoy morning coffee at **Vondelpark**, and explore world-class galleries without transportation logistics. The Conservatorium Hotel exemplifies this neighborhood's sophisticated cultural atmosphere.

The **Museum Quarter's tree-lined streets** create a quieter, more refined Amsterdam experience while keeping you within walking distance of the canal ring's excitement.

# Jordaan: Authentic Local Living

The **Jordaan neighborhood** offers Amsterdam's most authentic local experience. Former working-class streets now host charming cafés, artisan shops, and locals who've called this area home for generations. Staying here means experiencing Amsterdam as residents do – shopping at **weekly markets**, enjoying neighborhood brown cafés, and discovering hidden courtyards that tour groups never find.

# Sustainable Stays: Amsterdam's Green Hotel Revolution

Amsterdam's commitment to **sustainable tourism** has created exciting opportunities for environmentally conscious travelers. Many hotels now operate with **green energy**, offer **plastic-free accommodations**, and support local communities through sustainable practices.

**Hotel V Nesplein** leads this movement with their comprehensive sustainability program, including **local sourcing**, **waste reduction**, and **carbon-neutral operations**. Staying at these hotels lets you enjoy Amsterdam while supporting the city's efforts to maintain its beauty for future generations.

The trend toward **eco-conscious accommodations** isn't just about environmental responsibility; it's about experiencing Amsterdam more authentically by supporting businesses that care about the city's future.

# Essential Booking Tips for Amsterdam Success

**Timing matters enormously** in Amsterdam. Booking 3-6 months in advance often saves 30-40% compared to last-minute reservations, especially during **tulip season** (April-May) and **summer months** (June-August).

**Consider staying slightly outside the city center** for significant savings. Areas like **Zaandam** offer excellent train connections (6 minutes to central Amsterdam) with hotel rates often 50% lower than city center properties.

\*\*Look for hotels offering **museum passes** or **bike rentals** – these perks can save substantial money while enhancing your Amsterdam experience. Many hotels also provide **local neighborhood guides** created by staff who live in the area.

# Making Your Amsterdam Stay Unforgettable

The perfect Amsterdam hotel isn't just about thread count or marble bathrooms; it's about finding a place that connects you to the city's soul. Whether you choose a luxury canal-side suite, a quirky bridge house, or a cozy budget option, the right accommodation becomes part of your Amsterdam story.

I've learned that Amsterdam reveals its secrets gradually, through morning canal walks, conversations with hotel staff who grew up in the neighborhood, and quiet moments watching bicycle-riding locals navigate cobblestone streets with effortless grace. Your hotel choice determines which secrets you'll discover.

**What kind of Amsterdam experience calls to you?** The romantic canal-side luxury, the authentic local neighborhood living, or perhaps the unique adventure of staying in a converted bridge house?

I was honest with you and when fear ate me up it didn’t stop from being nor showing up 
You love me, I know that’s fact, but you hide all the key details from me , you weaved a fantasy by hiding the grit 
I knew and you knew but we felt like wouldn’t see each other so we spent every moment trying to get more 
We both ignored our shadows in bliss , I was aware that I was repeating a cycle but I don’t know if you were aware of repeating one too 
We both tried to hide in the beginning we let ourselves be seen but when I told you I chose you , you simply couldn’t believe it but you wanted me to be all yours and yours only 
I also wanted that , your mine in my mind is that the same for you ? 
Maybe out of love or fear 
I’m still all yours and no one else’s 
Now back into a neutral state, I realize what led to this now but I don’t regret any of it 
When we broke apart you seemed like you didn’t want to tell me that you were breaking up with me, you seemed like you had cried before, maybe the stress had hit you but you never told me 
I masked immediately out of fear or hurt 
I love you so I’m not angry simply a bit disappointed 
I have cried more then I thought I would 
Every thing with you feels like a dream and every night my dreams tell me parts of the future 

I’m becoming who I need to be 
But I grow concern for you , because you are similar to my past self, and I know that life like that is filled by misery and I don’t want you to go through the same thing 
I want to hold you in my arms, comb my fingers through your hair, and kiss you all over 
To tell you things that feel like law, that your worthy of everything, you don’t have to prove yourself and that running away does nothing
Your birthday is still my password, I still have all your photos and messages saved 
Now I’m not fixated on it , I’m letting go yet the belief that you will be back is stationary 
Despite the label we know, that this is cosa nuestra 
I don’t look at the photos because every memory of you is etched in to my mind 
You inspired the spark within me to rise and you illuminated each of my traits, both dark and light 

I love you even though you hurt me 
I love your smile, your laugh, all the little details that make you, your will to work, your ethics, how you want everyone to have the lightest day by being kind to them 
But tell me love why can’t you be kind to yourself ? 
Let yourself fall apart 
Let yourself be and feel , nobody is judging 

I may flirt with some girls or guys or whoever comes by,maybe dance with them but nothing more because I don’t want anybody else except you 
Because I have never met one like you my love and your soul is like the painted glasses in churches 
I wish you could see yourself the way I see you 
Whenever you speak bad of yourself, apart of me just wants to argue that belief out of you because you truly are a beautiful person not only looks but in soul 
I want you to notice it all 
I want you to believe in the love that I have for you 
And yes you make me feel beyond happy but not the feeling matters , I care about you , not what you make me feel 
No matter if we’re dating or not , I want the best for you 

Stop running because it will just devour you whole 

But for now I will dance, throw myself into academics, smoke a bit, and drink ; love everything around me 
I won’t wait for you but I will be patient because to be a  lover is to be a friend 
I love you as you are now and who you can become 
All those “imperfections” are just parts that create who you are so I accept them ether way and I love them too 
I hope you learn from this  

I could still feel you around me 
The bracelet you got me is in a box cus I fear to break it when I know you have worked hard to buy me it with the labor of your hands , I still kiss it despite not using it 
But I could feel the bracelet like a ghost on my wrist always 
I miss your hands on me and I miss those rare moments you would share parts of yourself with me , I enjoyed you like I will my coffee but I still want more despite the satisfaction 
And i still play the three songs you dedicated to me , I used to cry to them but now I just smile 
I don’t have just hope , I believe everything will work out 
You are my end and beginning and led me back to myself 
I would hide any positive feelings I had for you because I was afraid to get hurt , I wanted to perceive you as a random boy that I would flirt with in my home city, but I never truly saw you like that 
Mi Rey 
One day, we will look back and laugh at ourselves 

But I release any resentment or anger or disappointment because truly all I have for you is love 

May you find yourself once again, With all my love to you

It's quiet.
Not peaceful quiet.
Just still.
Like the words packed their bags one morning and left.
And I catch myself wondering,
how people manage to make such beautiful things
when they feel this empty and wordless.

I used to fear these silences.
Like it meant I was losing something.

But then I watched About Time,
where he could relive any day,
and instead of chasing more,
he just noticed
the smile, the rain, the quiet love
in ordinary moments.

And I’ve started to notice things too.

The way someone holds their coffee like it’s the only warmth they have left.
How laughter leaks out of a person even when their eyes look tired.
The quiet relief in someone’s face when they’re finally understood.
The heavy pause before someone says “I’m fine” and clearly isn’t.

The way someone softly hums while waiting in line.
The way an apology hides in a late-night “Did you eat?”
The quiet ache of scrolling through old photos,
and how even our phones remember better days.

I’ve started to notice the weight in other people’s eyes.
The way someone avoids talking about certain months.
How grief lives quietly in the corners of a smile.
How strong people get really good at saying “I’m okay” in a voice that begs not to be asked again.
Like the guy at the gym, 
who still feels out of place
lifting lighter weights than everyone else
but shows up anyway
every single day

And I realize I was never really out of words.
I was surrounded by them.
The words were always there and aren’t just written.
They’re lived.

And the silence isn’t empty after all.
It carries something to say
If I’m still enough to listen.

When considering Buffalo Trace Bourbon Cream, assess whether you prefer the robust flavor of bourbon and if you want versatility. It's ideal for enhancing coffee or experimenting with cocktail recipes, but it may not appeal to those who dislike bourbon's distinct notes.

Buffalo Trace Bourbon Cream is a worthy contender for the title of ""best Cream Liqueur"" because of its genuine bourbon infusion, rich dairy cream base, and versatility. It stands out against traditional cream liqueurs through the flavor of the specific spirit.While it might not replace other cream liqueurs, it is still a worthwhile purchase for bourbon and liqueur enthusiasts.

For over 12 years, I struggled with alcoholism, smoking, poor diet, high stress, and depression, which I believe triggered my premature graying. Today, I’m committing to a complete lifestyle overhaul, (5 days sober now) and I’d love your tips, experiences, or encouragement to make this work!

From what I’ve read, lifestyle changes can play a huge role in hair health and potentially even reverse graying in some cases, especially when it’s linked to stress, deficiencies, or poor habits. Here’s my plan for the next few months to give my body the best shot at restoring my natural hair color:

•  Fitness: Starting with strength training 3-4x a week and cardio to boost circulation and overall health. 

•  Walking: Aiming for 10,000 steps daily to reduce stress and improve blood flow to my scalp. 

•  Intermittent Fasting: Trying 16:8 to support cellular repair and reduce inflammation. 

•  Supplements: Planning to take biotin, vitamin B12, vitamin D, zinc, and copper. 

•  Healthy Eating: Switching to a nutrient-dense diet with lots of leafy greens, berries, nuts, seeds, fatty fish, and antioxidant-rich foods to fight oxidative stress. Cutting out processed junk and sugar. 

•  Cutting Coffee: Limiting to 1 cup a day to reduce cortisol (stress hormone) that might contribute to graying. 

•  Meditation: 10-15 minutes daily to manage stress, which is a big factor in premature graying. 

•  No Alcohol: 100% sober moving forward to let my body heal from years of damage. 

•  No Smoking: Quit cold turkey to improve oxygen flow and reduce toxins affecting my hair follicles. 

•  No Fap: Reducing this to improve energy and mental clarity (heard it might help with stress too).

I’m super motivated but also realistic—gray hair might be genetic for some, but since mine started during a rough period in my life, I’m hopeful that fixing my lifestyle can make a difference. Studies suggest that stress-related graying can sometimes be reversed by reducing oxidative stress and improving nutrient levels, so I’m all in!

What I’d love from you guys: 
•  Any tips or supplements you’ve tried that helped with gray hair? 
•  Success stories of lifestyle changes improving hair color or health? 
•  Other habits I should consider? I’ve heard about scalp massages to boost circulation, ashwagandha for stress, or even blackstrap molasses for minerals—any truth to these? 
•  How do you stay consistent with big lifestyle changes like this?

I’ll post update in 3 months to share my progress (with pics if I see changes!). Thanks for any advice or support—this community is awesome, and I’m excited to start this journey! 🙌",5,1749543542.0,greyhairreversal,1,1.0,False

Jafa here. I’m visiting your lovely city this weekend for my aunts birthday. Since I have some free time are there any recommendations on what I can do while in Wellington? I have already visited the lovely Museum.  

Also looking for a nice cafe. I’ve been told coffee in Wellington is pretty good. May have to try it out. ",3,1749543350.0,Wellington,4,0.71,False

I’m looking for someone traveling from **Tbilisi to India (especially Mumbai/Delhi)** who can help bring a few items for me. Since skincare is cheaper in Georgia and I’d love some local treats, I’m hoping to get:  
- **4 bottles (400ml ) of La Roche-Posay skincare** (specifics via DM).  
- **2-3 bottles of Georgian wine** (nothing fancy, just good local ones).  
- Optional extras if space allows: **Churchkhela or coffee**.  

### **Important Notes:**  
- **Alcohol cannot be shipped via parcel in India**, so I’ll need you to **hand-carry the wine** to my friend in Mumbai/Delhi. I’ll pick it up from them.  ( Porter ) 
- All items are **legal and for personal use**—no heavy luggage needed!  

### **Compensation:**  
- I’ll cover the  cost of items + extra for your effort (DM me your price).  
- If you’re not coming to my city, I’ll arrange pickup from Mumbai/Delhi.  

### Interested ?

DM me—even if you can only bring part of the request! I’ll delete this post once fulfilled.  

Thanks in advance! You’d be a huge help.  ",0,1749543291.0,TbilisiStudentLife,0,0.5,False
1l7t9o8,https://youtu.be/7UmIPpyjlBQ,Struggled with pre-filling form fields in Elementor Popups? Here’s how I finally figured it out (so you don’t have to 😅),"Just wanted to share something that had me scratching my head for days while building a site.

I was trying to pre-fill Elementor form fields *inside a popup,* like pulling in the post title, product info, or even user data dynamically. 

Sounds simple, right? But there wasn’t a straightforward guide anywhere. Everything I found was either outdated or only half-working.

After a lot of trial and error (and a few cups of frustration-coffee), I finally got it working using pre-query parameters, custom code and let me tell you, once you crack it, it opens up a bunch of smart form use cases. 

Super handy for lead capture, booking flows, or even personalized user experiences.

Thought I’d share the full step-by-step so it might save someone else the struggle.

If you’ve ever wanted to auto-fill form fields in an Elementor popup based on what page/post/product the user clicked from this might help!

Also, I’ve collected a bunch of similar code snippets and little workarounds for Elementor over time. 

So if you’re stuck on something specific and can’t find a native way to do it, feel free to ask, happy to share whatever I can. We all know how tricky Elementor can get with custom stuff sometimes 😄

Hope this helps someone out there!",1,1749543274.0,elementor,1,0.67,False
