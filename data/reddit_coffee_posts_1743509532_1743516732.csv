What have they adapted to help their routines or what do you do to help your own?,"My SO (30M) was dx with ADHD in mid to late 20’s. He basically always did really well in school and at work but is super disorganized and struggles a lot to get personal tasks done but is very strict about certain routines. I guess when he was growing up, they had a nanny and a live in maid so on top of being disorganized, someone “picked up the pieces” to a high degree so it helped mask things in a way. Now as an adult without those services, he is very clean and organized about specific things (paperwork, dr appt always made/on time, work, workout/gym on struct routine, kitchen and dishes always clean, self care and hygiene always complete) but usually kinda unintentionally destructive (breaks a lot of things, dirt tracked shoes in the house, floors are filthy, chargers and cords everywhere, piles of clean clothes everywhere, losing things often, cant pack or leave house w/o going back inside 3-5 times) or late to social events which affects my schedule. I try to keep things separate usually but when we go places together it’s kind of a challenge. 

One of the biggest things he does is lose things and become extremely frantic and distraught over it which is an interesting reaction. And then later gets really embarrassed about it which makes me feel bad for him. We had to share a car today as a one off situation and commuted to work together while he stayed with me during a house project being done at his; we were on time and everyting was fine but he kept going in and out of the house to get coffee, go back get water, go back and get shoes, gets shoes on but forgets bag and goes back inside and tracks dirt in while doing that haha  so after that back and forth, we were still mostly on time but then he lost his phone somehow between waking up, showering and coming downstairs before leaving. He tore through the whole car like just turning everytihng upside down and inside out and it wasnt there. We both ran back into the house to find the phone and couldn’t find it everywhere. Tried calling it but it was on silent….. tore through the couches and somehow i guess he had decided to be helpful and fold a throw blanket on the couches and put it on top of the phone (and forgot) and after 15 min we found it there. I guess we all do that kind of stuff sometimes bc its life but he was SO frantic and flustered, then embarrassed and then we were both really late getting to where we were going to I was then frustrated as heck

. Does your SO with ADHD have specific routines in order to prevent losing and forgetting things? I was going to suggests he use find my phone on ipad/Apple Watch to ping the phone instead of tearing through things? Packing bags and putting it by the door the night before, waking up 15 min earlier or starting to leave 15 min pre leaving so theres time to lose things and go back and forth (I realize I cannot control that part)… how do you not also run late to things when your SO struggles with ADHD forgetfulness and losing things?

Az elmúlt másfél évtizedben a kábítószer-fogyasztás Magyarországon nem robbant be társadalmi tömegjelenségként. Az életprevalencia – azaz azok aránya, akik életükben legalább egyszer fogyasztottak valamilyen tiltott szert – csupán 6–8% körüli, szemben a nyugat-európai országok 30–45%-os értékeivel. A leggyakrabban használt szer a marihuána, és még a fiatal felnőttek körében is csupán \~3–4% az éves használók aránya. Magyarország ezzel az egyik legalacsonyabb kockázatú ország Európában a kábítószer-fogyasztás szempontjából – különösen a nyugat-európai országokhoz és a régión belüli Csehországhoz képest, ahol az arányok ennek sokszorosai.

Bár egyes olcsó szintetikus szerek (pl. herbál) **vidéken időnként komoly helyi problémát okoznak**, ez nem jelenti a drogfogyasztás általános robbanását. A kábítószerhez köthető halálesetek száma is rendkívül alacsony: évi 30–40 eset körül mozgott az elmúlt években, ami 5 haláleset/millió fő alatt marad – az európai átlag (\~22/millió) töredéke. Ehhez képest több nyugat-európai országban (pl. Franciaország, Németország, Egyesült Királyság) jóval magasabbak ezek a számok, Skóciában például a halálozási arány több mint 50-szerese a magyarnak.

A magyar büntetőpolitika szigorú: még a kis mennyiségű birtoklás is bűncselekmény, bár első alkalommal van lehetőség elterelésre. A regisztrált kábítószeres bűncselekmények többsége azonban nem kereskedelemhez, hanem saját használathoz köthető. **A rendőri intézkedések zöme tehát nem a drogpiac elleni küzdelmet, hanem a kisfelhasználók büntetését célozza**. A kormányzati retorika ezzel szemben gyakran drámai hangvételű: a drogok súlyos társadalmi fenyegetésként való beállítása (pl. „drogmentes Magyarország 2020”) nincs arányban a valós társadalmi mutatókkal. A dizájnerdrogok terjedése és néhány lokális krízis valós problémát jelez, ám a statisztikai adatok alapján Magyarország összességében még mindig a kevésbé érintett országok közé tartozik Európában.

**A kábítószer-fogyasztás jelen van, de a helyzet nem indokolja a társadalmi pánikkeltést.** A túlzottan represszív megközelítés helyett célravezetőbb volna a célzott prevenció, ártalomcsökkentés, és a fiatalokkal való hiteles kommunikáció. A politikai napirenden való túlhangsúlyozása – különösen választási ciklusok idején – inkább figyelemelterelő stratégia, semmint valós problémaarányra épülő kormányzati fellépés.

# A drogfogyasztás társadalmi problémája Magyarországon (2010–2024) – nemzetközi összehasonlítás

**Drogfogyasztás elterjedtsége Magyarországon (2010–2024)**

**Életprevalencia és aktuális használat:** Magyarországon a lakosság viszonylag kis hányada próbált ki illegális szereket. Hazai felmérések szerint *„minden tizenharmadik magyar fogyasztott már drogot”*, azaz az élete során a felnőttek mintegy \~7-8%-a használt valamilyen illegális szert . Ez az arány jóval alacsonyabb, mint Nyugat-Európában – valószínűleg részben a szigorú büntetőjogi szabályozás visszatartó hatása miatt . A legutóbbi országos drogfelmérések alapján Magyarországon 2019-re továbbra is a kannabisz a legelterjedtebb illegális szer: a 18–64 éves népesség 7,4%-a próbálta már ki életében . A fiatal felnőttek körében (18–34 év) ez az arány magasabb, \~13-14% , de még mindig alacsonyabb, mint sok európai országban. Ráadásul a trendek enyhülést mutatnak: **2015 és 2019 között csökkent** a legelterjedtebb szerek (marihuána, extasy, szintetikus kannabinoidok, amfetamin, kokain) használata Magyarországon, más szereké stagnált vagy kismértékben csökkent . Vagyis a 2010-es éveket összességében nem a drogfogyasztás robbanásszerű terjedése jellemezte Magyarországon, hanem inkább stabilizálódás vagy mérsékelt csökkenés a fiatalok körében.

**Aktuális használat (preválencia):** A teljes felnőtt népességben az *aktuális* drogfogyasztók aránya igen csekély. 2019-ben az elmúlt egy évben kannabiszt használók aránya a 18–64 éves magyarok körében \~2% körüli volt (fiatal felnőtteknél 3–4%) . Konkrétan a 18–34 éves korosztály *3,5%*\-a használt kannabiszt az elmúlt évben, míg más illegális szerek (pl. MDMA \~2%, amfetamin \~1,4%, kokain <1%) még ennél is ritkábbak voltak ebben a korcsoportban . Összességében tehát Magyarországon a rendszeres vagy aktuális illegális szerhasználat társadalmi szinten alacsony szintű – a fiatalság egy kis hányada érintett főként alkalmi kannabiszhasználatban. Emellett fontos megjegyezni, hogy **jelentős területi különbségek** vannak: számszerűleg Budapest és környéke a leginkább érintett a drogfogyasztásban, ugyanakkor a 2010-es években vidéken a *„dizájnerdrogok”* (ismeretlen összetételű, házilag kotyvasztott olcsó szintetikus szerek, pl. herbál, biofű) terjedése okozott komoly problémákat . Ezek a szegényebb, gyakran fiatalkorú vidéki felhasználók körében terjedő szerek súlyos egészségügyi károkat okoznak, noha a használóik száma összességében alacsonyabb, mint a hagyományosabb szereknél a városokban . Ez a jelenség tehát földrajzilag és társadalmilag koncentrált probléma Magyarországon belül.

**Nemzetközi kitekintés: Magyarország vs. Európa**

**Prevalencia (életprevalencia):** A magyarországi drogfogyasztási mutatók régiós és nyugat-európai összehasonlításban alacsonynak számítanak. Az alábbi táblázat összefoglalja néhány kiválasztott ország becsült **életprevalencia-értékeit** (a felnőtt lakosság hány %-a használt már valaha illegális szert, jellemzően kannabiszt) valamint a fiatalok körében mért **aktuális használat**ot:

|**Ország**|**Illegális szer élete során (% felnőtt lakosság)\*\***|**Kannabisz használat az elmúlt évben (% fiatal felnőttek)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Magyarország**|**6–8%** (2019)|**\~3–4%** (18–34 év, 2019)|
|**Csehország**|\~30% (2020)|\~20% (15–34 év, 2016)|
|**Lengyelország**|\~12% (2018)|\~5% (becsült, 15–34 év) \*|
|**Szlovákia**|\~23% (2023)|\~8–10% (becsült, 15–34 év) \*|
|**Románia**|\~6% (2019)|<2% (becsült, 15–34 év) \*|
|**Bulgária**|\~9% (2020)|\~3% (becsült, 15–34 év) \*|
|**Franciaország**|\~47% (2021)|\~22% (18–34 év, 2017)|
|**Németország**|\~35% (2021)|\~13% (18–34 év, becsült) \*|
|**Spanyolország**|\~41% (2022)|\~17% (15–34 év, becsült) \*|
|**Hollandia**|\~29% (2022)|\~15% (15–34 év, becsült) \*|
|**Egyesült Királyság**|\~30–35% (becsült)\*\*|\~10% (16–34 év, 2020) \*|

***Forrás:*** *EMCDDA adatok és becslések.* ***Megjegyzés:*** *A legtöbb ország esetén a kannabisz életprevalenciája szerepel proxyként (mivel a valaha drogot használók döntő többsége kannabiszt próbált). \*A csillaggal jelölt aktuális használati adatok becslések, mivel pontos érték nem áll rendelkezésre minden országhoz azonos módszertannal.*

**Elemzés:** Jól látható, hogy **Magyarország a legalacsonyabbak között** van az illegális szerhasználat elterjedtsége terén Európában. A hasonló közép-kelet-európai országok közül csak Románia mutat Magyarországhoz közeli, alacsony értéket (mindkét országban \~6% körüli az életprevalencia) . Bulgária is csak kis mértékben magasabb (\~9%) . Ezzel szemben **Csehország** kiemelkedik a régióban: a felnőttek közel egyharmada próbált már drogot (főként kannabiszt) , ami megközelíti a nyugat-európai szintet. Csehországban a fiatal felnőttek éves kannabisz-használata (\~20%) is többszöröse a magyarországinak . **Szlovákia** és **Lengyelország** a két véglet között helyezkedik el: náluk a lifetime mutatók közepesek (10–20% közötti), ami a magyar értékek duplája vagy több, de elmarad Nyugat-Európától . Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a **Nyugat-Európai országokban lényegesen magasabb** a drogfogyasztók aránya. Franciaországban például a felnőttek csaknem fele (47,3%) fogyasztott már életében kannabiszt , Spanyolországban is \~41% ez az arány , míg Németországban \~35% . Ezek a számok többszöröse a magyarországinak. Az Egyesült Királyságban (bár EU-n kívüli, de nyugat-európai példa) szintén **a felnőttek kb. egyharmada** érintett volt már valamilyen droghasználatban élete során – hasonlóan a nyugat-európai trendhez. Az aktuális használat terén is nagy a különbség: míg Magyarországon alig \~3-4% a fiatalok körében az éves prevalencia, addig Franciaországban \~21–22%, Hollandiában \~15%, a briteknél \~10% körüli (a 16–34 éves korosztályban) egy éves időtávon . **Összefoglalva:** Nyugat-Európában sokkal inkább tömegjelenség a (főleg rekreációs) drogfogyasztás, míg Magyarországon és néhány szomszédos országban a társadalom jóval kisebb szegmense érintett.

**Kábítószer okozta halálesetek és egészségi ártalmak**

**Halálozási adatok Magyarországon:** Az illegális szerekhez köthető **túladagolásos halálesetek** száma Magyarországon alacsony és évek óta viszonylag stabil. Éves szinten jellemzően mindössze néhány tucat ilyen esetet regisztrálnak. 2012 és 2017 között például évente **20–33 fő** volt a kifejezetten kábítószer-indukálta halálesetek száma . 2017-ben 33 ilyen halálesetet jelentettek Magyarországon , ami megfelel **5 haláleset/millió lakos** aránynak a 15–64 éves népességre vetítve . Ez az érték messze elmarad az európai átlagtól: az **EU-átlag \~22 haláleset/millió** (2017-ben) , vagyis a magyar mutató ennek durván az egynegyede. A 2010-es évek során nem tapasztaltak meredek növekedést: sőt, a 2010 körüli években a heroin visszaszorulása miatt inkább átrendeződés történt a halálozások okában. 2010 után a heroin kínálat jelentősen visszaesett Magyarországon, így a heroin-túladagolások ritkábbá váltak . Azóta az esetleges halálesetekben nagyobb arányban bukkannak fel más opioidok (pl. gyógyszerek) kombinációban, illetve szintetikus szerek (amfetamin, MDMA, katinonok, biofű) is . Fontos kiemelni, hogy a magyarországi droghalálozások abszolút száma nemcsak nyugati, hanem sok régiós országhoz képest is nagyon alacsony.

**Összehasonlítás más országokkal:** Közép- és Kelet-Európa több országában hasonlóan **alacsony a kábítószer okozta halálozás**. Romániában és Bulgáriában például szintén csak évi néhány eset fordul elő, ami 1–3 fő/millió arányt jelent – az egyik legalacsonyabb Európában . Ezzel szemben Nyugat-Európa több országát súlyosabb **opioidjárvány** terheli, ami magas halálozási mutatókban is megnyilvánul. Írországban például 2022-ben \~97 fő/millió volt a droghalálozási ráta, jelenleg ez az egyik legmagasabb az EU-ban. Az Egyesült Királyságban (bár nem EU-tag) különösen aggasztó a helyzet: **Skóciában** Európa messze legsúlyosabb droghalálozási válsága alakult ki az utóbbi években, 2023-ban 1 172 halálesetet regisztráltak, ami **\~277 haláleset/millió fő** arányt jelent – majdnem *háromszorosa* a második legrosszabb európai értéknek . Ehhez képest a magyarországi 5 fő/millió rendkívül alacsony érték, és még a nyugat-európai nagy országokban is jóval mérsékeltebb a halálozás: Franciaországban például évi \~300–400 közötti droghalálozás fordul elő (2017-ben 373 eset , \~9 fő/millió), Németországban \~20 fő/millió körüli az arány, ami még mindig többszöröse a magyar helyzetnek. **Röviden:** Magyarországon a kábítószer miatti elhalálozás társadalmi szinten csekély; a drogfogyasztás okozta legsúlyosabb egészségügyi kár jelensége – az opioid túladagolás – hazánkban nem tömeges mértékű, szemben néhány nyugati országgal.

**Egyéb egészségügyi hatások:** Magyarországon a 2010-es években a drogfogyasztás egészségügyi vonatkozásában inkább a **járulékos ártalmak** kerültek előtérbe, mintsem a halálozás. Ilyen például a fertőző betegségek terjedése az injektáló használók körében. A dizájnerdrogok injektálása miatt 2011–2015 között ugrásszerűen megnőtt a hepatitis C vírus előfordulása a hazai intravénás szerhasználóknál. Az egykor Európa-hírű tűcsere programok leállítása (2014) után Budapesten kis *HIV-járvány* is kialakult a drogos közösségben – ez azonban továbbra is lokális jellegű maradt. Ezek a problémák rámutatnak, hogy bár a **droghasználat elterjedtsége kicsi**, a megfelelő prevenciós és ártalomcsökkentő intézkedések hiánya esetén kis populációkon belül is súlyos egészségügyi krízisek adódhatnak. Nyugat- és Közép-Európában sok ország komoly hangsúlyt fektet az ártalomcsökkentésre (pl. tűcsere, felvilágosítás, terápiák) – Franciaországban pl. \~178 ezer opioid-függő részesül fenntartó kezelésben –, ezzel szemben Magyarországon az opioidhelyettesítő kezelésekbe bevontak száma 700 fő alatti (2017-ben 669 fő) , és a prevenciós programok is akadoztak az utóbbi évtizedben (lásd alább).

**Kriminalizáció és kábítószer-bűnözés mutatói**

**Bűnügyi statisztikák Magyarországon:** A kábítószerrel kapcsolatos *regisztrált bűncselekmények* száma Magyarországon 2010 és 2020 között enyhe növekedést mutatott . Míg 2010-ben \~**4 828** kábítószer-bűncselekményt regisztráltak, addig 2020-ban már **7 113** esetet . (2018-ban volt egy kiugró csúcs \~8 640 esettel, feltehetően egy évben lezajlott fokozott rendőrségi akció vagy a dizájnerdrog-hullám miatt .) A regisztrált esetek túlnyomó többsége – 2010-ben például **85,5%** – *fogyasztói típusú bűncselekmény* volt, és csupán \~14% köthető kereskedelemhez vagy kínálathoz . Ez azt jelenti, hogy a hatósági eljárások zöme **kis mennyiségű birtoklás vagy fogyasztás miatti eljárás**, nem pedig nagyszabású drogcsempész-hálózatok felszámolása. 2010-ben például 5789 eljárás indult kábítószerrel visszaélés miatt, ebből 4952 eset volt *saját fogyasztás*, és mindössze 795 eset (13,7%) minősült kereskedői tevékenységnek . Hasonló arányok valószínűsíthetők az elmúlt években is – a kisfelhasználók vannak leginkább kitéve a büntetőeljárásnak.

**Jogi megközelítés és nemzetközi különbségek:** Magyarország drogpolitikáját 2010 után a *zéró tolerancia* elve és a büntetőjogi eszközök hangsúlya jellemezte. A kis mennyiségű drog birtoklása is bűncselekménynek minősül (2 évig terjedő szabadságvesztéssel fenyegetve), bár első alkalommal elterelés – kezelésen való részvétel – lehetősége fennáll. Összehasonlítva: **Csehország** 2010-ben dekriminalizálta a csekély mennyiségű drog birtoklását (szabálysértésnek minősül, pénzbírsággal), így ott a fogyasztókat kevésbé fenyegeti börtön. Ennek ellenére Csehországban a *droghasználók aránya jóval magasabb*, ami arra utal, hogy a dekriminalizáció nem okozott extra növekedést – viszont a rendőrségi statisztikákban kevesebb a kisfogyasztó elleni ügy. **Lengyelország** ezzel szemben sokáig Magyarországhoz hasonlóan szigorú volt (2000-es években évi \~30 ezer eljárás indult pusztán birtoklás miatt) , de 2011-től bevezették az eljárás megszüntetésének lehetőségét csekély mennyiségnél. **Szlovákia** és **Románia** is alapvetően büntetőjogilag kezeli a drogfogyasztókat, magas törvényi tételekkel, míg **Bulgária** a régió egyik legszigorúbb büntetőpolitikáját folytatta (akár kis mennyiségért is letöltendő börtön). Ehhez képest több nyugat-európai ország *eltérő utat* követ: **Hollandia** régóta tolerálja a kannabisz kiskereskedelmet (coffee shop-ok), és a fogyasztókat nem kriminalizálja – ennek ellenére Hollandiában a kannabisz életprevalencia (29%) csak középmezőnybe tartozik, nem kiugróan magas . **Spanyolországban** de facto dekriminalizálták a magáncélú fogyasztást és kismennyiségű birtoklást (bár közterületen pénzbírsággal sújtható), illetve működnek ún. kannabisz klubok. **Németország** több tartományában már régóta alkalmazzák a kis mennyiségek miatti eljárások megszüntetését, és 2024-től a kannabisz részleges legális szabályozására készülnek. **Franciaország** sokáig szigorú (akár 1 éves börtönnel fenyegető) törvényt alkalmazott a fogyasztók ellen, de 2018-tól áttértek a helyszíni bírságolásra, enyhítve a rendőrség leterheltségét. **Az Egyesült Királyságban** a drog birtoklása illegális maradt, de a gyakorlatban a kannabisz-fogyasztókat gyakran csak figyelmeztetik; ennek ellenére a kemény szerek (főleg heroin, újabban fentanil-származékok) miatti halálozás ott kiemelkedően magas, ami komplex szociális és egészségügyi válságra utal, nem pusztán büntetőjogi kérdésre.

**Bűnözési mutatók és trendek:** A kábítószerhez köthető bűncselekmények aránya a teljes bűnözésből Magyarországon nem kiugró. 2020-ban az összes regisztrált bűncselekménynek csak kis százalékát tették ki a kábítószeres esetek . Ugyanakkor a rendőrségi erőforrások jelentős részét leköti a drogfogyasztók elleni eljárás: évente több ezer fogyasztót vonnak elterelésbe vagy állítanak bíróság elé. Ez nem sajátosan magyar jelenség – Európa-szerte a drog miatt indult ügyek túlnyomó része személyes használathoz kapcsolódik. Franciaországban például 2017-ben **223 509** kábítószeres bűnesetet regisztráltak egy év alatt (lakosságarányosan sokszorosa a magyar számnak), amelyek zöme (kb. 90%-a) kannabisz birtoklás miatti rendőri intézkedés. **Németországban** 2016-ban \~302 ezer drogügyet regisztráltak, ebből \~231 ezer pusztán fogyasztással kapcsolatos eset volt . Ezek a számok jól mutatják, hogy Nyugat-Európában a magasabb használati arány párosul a bűnüldözési statisztikákban megjelenő esetszámok növekedésével, noha egyre több ország igyekszik *de facto* enyhíteni a fogyasztók üldözését. Magyarország e téren szigorúbb maradt: a kábítószer-bűnözés elleni fellépés fő iránya a kereslet (fogyasztás) visszaszorítása büntetéssel. Ennek társadalmi hatásossága vitatott; a hazai adatok alapján a szigorú szabályozás ellenére is nőtt a regisztrált esetek száma az évtized során , ami jelezheti akár a használat némi terjedését 2010 után, akár a fokozott rendőrségi jelenlétet e területen.

**Drogfogyasztás a politikai retorikában és a valóságban**

**Kormányzati kommunikáció:** A 2010 utáni magyar kormányzat a drogfogyasztást gyakran **súlyos társadalmi veszélyként** állította be retorikájában. Ezt jól mutatja, hogy a 2013-ban elfogadott Nemzeti Drogstratégia alcélja az volt, hogy *„2020-ra drogmentessé teszi Magyarországot”* . Ez egy rendkívül ambiciózus – sokak szerint irreális – célkitűzés volt, amely végül nem valósult meg (2020-ra nyilvánvalóan nem tűnt el a drogfogyasztás). A politikai üzenet azonban egyértelmű: a kormány *zéró toleranciát* hirdetett, és a drogot mint jelenséget teljesen felszámolandónak állította be. 2021–2022-ben a kormányzati nyilatkozatokban ismét előtérbe került a dizájnerdrogok elleni küzdelem – a kommunikáció nagy hangsúlyt helyezett a *„herbál”* és egyéb szintetikus szerek terjedésére, mint új fenyegetésre . 2023-ban Orbán Viktor miniszterelnök egy **drogellenes kormánybiztost** is kinevezett a *kábítószer-kereskedelem felszámolására* – Horváth László személyében –, jelezve, hogy a kormány a kínálat elleni háborút is szimbolikusan fel kívánja erősíteni . Ez egybeesett a 2024-es választási kampány közeledtével, vagyis a drogellenes harc retorikája politikai napirendre került. Összességében a hivatalos retorika a drogfogyasztást gyakran a nemzeti szuverenitást és a fiatal generációkat fenyegető *„komoly veszélyként”* festi le, amely ellen *harcolni* kell.

**A retorika és a statisztikák viszonya:** A rendelkezésre álló adatok alapján azonban felmerül a kérdés, mennyire igazolja a valós helyzet ezt a dramatizált veszélyérzetet. Magyarország – amint a fentiekben láttuk – **jóval kedvezőbb mutatókkal** rendelkezik, mint a legtöbb nyugat-európai ország: kevesebb a drogfogyasztó, kevesebb a haláleset. Természetesen ez nem jelenti azt, hogy ne kellene foglalkozni a problémával, hiszen *minden egyes haláleset és sors fontos*, illetve a dizájnerdrogok okozta helyi krízisek valósak. Ugyanakkor a **droghelyzet súlyossága Magyarországon regionális és nyugati viszonylatban mérve mérsékeltnek mondható**. Ezt támasztja alá, hogy a magyarok körében a drogfogyasztás elterjedtsége alacsonyabb, mint akár a szomszédos országok többségében , miközben a kormányzat kommunikációja sokszor ugyanolyan kemény hangot üt meg, mintha egy nyugat-európai típusú drogválság fenyegetne. A *“drogmentes Magyarország 2020”* víziójának kudarca is jelzi, hogy a **probléma komplex**: pusztán tiltással nem tűnik el a fogyasztás, legfeljebb rejtőzködőbbé válik. Szakértők rámutatnak arra az ellentmondásra is, hogy a magyar állam egyik oldalról látványosan támogatja a legális addikciót (az alkoholfogyasztást) – pl. alkoholmarketing, “nemzeti kocsma-program” – miközben a *drogfogyasztókat üldözi* . Valójában az alkohol társadalmi és egészségügyi kárai messze meghaladják az illegális szerekét, mégis kulturális okokból ez kevésbé van megbélyegezve . Ez a kettős mérce némiképp gyengíti a drogellenes retorika hitelességét szakmai körökben.

**Összegzés:** Magyarország 2010–2024 közötti drogfogyasztási helyzetét mérsékelt szint és lassan változó trendek jellemzik. **Regionális összehasonlításban hazánk a kevésbé érintett országok közé tartozik – se a használat elterjedtsége, se a droghalálozás nem éri el a nyugati szintet.** A kormányzati kommunikáció ennek ellenére gyakran a *súlyos társadalmi veszély* narratíváját alkalmazza, ami részben a politikai napirend és értékrend kifejezése. A statisztikák azonban **nem mutatnak drámai járványszerű romlást**: a drogfogyasztás Magyarországon továbbra is marginálisabb jelenség, mint Európa nyugati felén . A valódi kihívást inkább az jelenti, hogyan lehet hatékonyan kezelni a meglévő problémákat (pl. dizájnerdrog-fogyasztás a leszakadó régiókban, prevenció a fiatalok körében) anélkül, hogy a jelenséget túl- vagy alulbecsülnénk. A nemzetközi összehasonlítás rávilágít: **Magyarország helyzete kedvezőbb, mint ahogy a politikai retorika sugallja**, de nem szabad megfeledkezni arról sem, hogy a probléma létezik – csak éppenséggel más jellegű és mértékű, mint a súlyosabb drogfertőzöttségű országokban. A kiegyensúlyozott stratégia megkövetelné az adatokon nyugvó megközelítést: a *túlzott riogatás* helyett a célzott megelőzés és kezelés erősítését, hogy a jelenleginél se váljon nagyobb társadalmi gonddá a drogfogyasztás Magyarországon.

I told her that I wouldn't be apologizing because I had nothing to apologize for, and we got into an argument over the phone where she called me unnecessarily disrespectful, narcissistic, and childish and I said she wasn't appreciating how much I wanted to look out for her on her wedding day.

Eventually she hung up, and after thinking about it for a while I decided I couldn't get my point to the father / her husband's colleague through them,  so I thought I'd contact him directly and told Sheena I wanted to say sorry. She got his number from her husband and sent it to me, so I texted him telling him the following:

""Hi, I was the maid of honor at the wedding of your colleague you attended a few days back. If you're free any time soon, I'd like to meet up for coffee tomorrow and discuss what happened since I feel like tensions have been left unresolved. Let me know what you think.""

1jowaum,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1jowaum/the_only_bits_of_atomic_habits_that_actually/,The Only Bits of Atomic Habits That Actually Stuck With Me,"I read Atomic Habits thinking it would change my life. And like most self-help books, I forgot half of it a week later.

But a few parts hit deep and those actually helped.

Here’s what’s stuck:

1. “You don’t rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.”

This one slapped. 

I used to set goals like “write every day” or “work out more,” then wonder why I wasn’t doing them. Turns out, goals are vibes. Systems are calendars, timers, reminders, and zero guesswork.

Now I don’t say, “I’ll write daily.” I say, “Every morning after coffee, I open the doc, even if I just stare at it.”

2. Habit stacking actually works.

It sounds corny at first. But pairing a habit you want with one you already do helps.

I started doing 10 push-ups after brushing my teeth. Not because I’m a beast—because that was literally the only time I remembered.

Small stuff, stuck to something familiar, adds up. You feel like a functioning person again.

3. Make it easy. Stupid easy.

I used to think habits had to be hard to count. “If it’s not intense, it’s not real.” Nope.

James Clear says to reduce the friction. Want to read more? Put the book on your pillow. Want to stop snacking? Hide the damn snacks.

I started prepping coffee the night before and suddenly stopped skipping breakfast. Magic? Nope, just lazy-proofing!

4. Identity first.

This was big: stop trying to do the habit to get the result. Do the habit to become the kind of person who does it.

“I’m a writer” → more effective than “I want to write.”
“I’m someone who works out” → stronger than “I need to get fit.”

I do feel like all these little habits have helped me become a more balanced, happier dude. I've written before how as I approach middle-age I'm fitter and happier than ever.

So even though I don't remember most of Atomic Habits, I remember enough to make a positive difference. 😊",6,1743516054.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

1jow8wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1jow8wg/surving_burnout/,Surving burnout,"32F- I get this a lot people say I sound immature from what I post. I sound like a teenager, and judgement aside, I need some good advice. I have been floundering for a long time. I got an art degree (film studies) I’ve been doing stand up for 10 years. I live in a small affluent town. It took me a long time to understand the socioeconomics here. It’s a lot of old money and everyone else is fucked. 

The economy is a tourism economy, looooooooots of small businesses. Looks cute and fun from the outside but these people have money money. And that’s how they start and maintain these cool cute little places.

My family doesn’t have money. I came here to go to college. And I just idk never left. I am a little immature. My pysch called me a late bloomer. 

My goal was to move to LA and do movies and comedy. And I just couldn’t seem to get there. I just didn’t know how to make the move. I came really close once. I had a roommate and I had 10k saved up, but my credit kept me from getting a place. That was 5 years ago. Mg credit is still bad. I can only get a line of $400 max.

I’ve been working in coffee, again, super naive but I thought if I could make it to management, I’d be okay. So I did that. And honestly my pay hasn’t really improved much since I started. I’ve worked for three different businesses and no matter what I did, management, supervisor, barista, the pay always averaged out to around $500 a week, $30k a year. 

I’ve always had to have a second job. 

I get bullied a lot. and I think I am finally understanding what is going on, and again, I’m just naive. The people I am surrounded by are uber wealthy, they don’t know pain and struggle, and this town thrives on pretty privilege. It really is just like mean rich people looking down on people. It’s a very weird feeling. And it’s taken me all this time to figure it out. I thought I was the problem.

Last week after I had a house fire and lost a few things, and was honestly in a state of shock and exhaustion(clean up is a lot) I tried to call out and my boss was not going to pick my shift up. I was really angry and that felt kind of fucked up to me, so I impulsively quit.

after I quit I slept hard for two days. I had been experiencing serious burn out. 

I have a second job where I do ghost tours, and honestly American history is so unsettling to me, it’s so upsetting to talk about. A major part of the tour is talking about what happened to the native tribes here, and it’s like emotionally debilitating to tell these stories and make people laugh. It just morally feels really wrong.

Yesterday I had the biggest crash out in a while. I cried really hard, I ended up puking for hours. the house I live in smells from the fire, and idk I just got really nauseous and was like projectile vomiting. I had to pull over twice while driving to puke.

I have $30 and no income and debt. I could keep doing these tours but it’s having a really horrible impact on me. 

I’m thinking about getting a serving job. I came close to doing an OF and put my Venmo on instagram because I need money. 

My landlord is letting me clean an apartment for $300 and my parents and giving me $300. I have bills that are backed up. 

I’m just experiencing serious burn out. and im not sure what to do next. I just want to sleep. 

I don’t want to stay in this town. I want to leave and move to a bigger city with more diversity and jobs and a place that can pay a liveable wage. ",1,1743515917.0,Adulting,2,1.0,False

*Brooklyn, New York*

*9 p.m.*

*Exactly 3 weeks before Helena’s arrival at camp…*

Helena sighed as she stepped out of the Fulton St. subway station, and began her couple-block march home. The walk there was a pretty easy one, as they admittedly lived in one of the more welcoming parts of Brooklyn, and Helena had her powers to protect her from any real danger, at least in her mind.

She had just finished a late night dance rehearsal, and still had her leggings and leotard on underneath her sweatshirt and hoodie. Her mom had intended on picking her up, but something had come up at work which had forced her to stay a bit later. Helena didn’t care. She liked hanging out with her mom fine, but walking and taking the subway places always felt more natural to her, and she liked to use walks like this one to plan out new morning jog routes. She had sort of a one-track mind.

As she came upon their apartment building, she noticed the lack of lights in any of the windows, and paused for a brief moment to observe the place. Her and her mother lived on the third floor of one of the nicer apartment buildings in Fort Greene, a neighborhood on the West side of Brooklyn. At nine in the evening, she would normally expect the place to be lit up like a Christmas tree, but it was completely devoid of lights.

She made her way inside, using her key to open the place up and mashing her finger into the up button on the elevator. It didn’t light up, and Helena quickly began to grow more panicked, as she ran through all the possibilities in her mind for what the problem could be.

A transformer issue was most likely, they had those problems every once in a while, but then the entire block would be having outages, and none of the other buildings had looked dark when she was outside. A single downed wire could be the cause, but there hadn’t been any storms recently that could have caused it, and her mom probably would have texted her.

At this thought, Helena began moving towards the stairs, throwing the door open and bounding up them two at a time. Her mom hadn’t responded to her text that she was on the subway, nor had she responded to her when she got off. Not only that, but just the fact the power was out and she hadn’t heard anything from her was concerning enough. Helena felt her pulse increasing as she came to the door of the third floor and stopped, trying to take stock of things.

Helena wasn’t a paranoid person by nature, but something felt *wrong.* Not hearing from her mom, only her building being without power, not seeing anyone in the entrance hallway or the stairs. It was all so abnormal. Helena had never really had any issues with demigod weirdness, much to her annoyance, but she had always imagined it would come by some monster cornering her in an alleyway and an epic fight ensuing, not like this. She had no evidence to think that this had anything to do with her being a half-blood, but she had a bad feeling, and Helena’s short visits to Camp had taught her not to ignore bad feelings.

The daughter of Heracles dropped to one knee, her back to the wall of the third floor landing, and unslung the overweight athletic bag from her shoulder. She always kept the thing on her, as she basically always had some sort of practice or event to attend, and had long since decided she was better off lugging it everywhere than running home to grab it every few hours. More than that though, this thing had one of her only connections to Camp in it.

She rummaged through the bag, brushing aside her wrestling shoes and dance slippers, until she eventually caught sight of the shining glint of the Celestial Bronze threaded cloth tape she had received on one of her last Camp Half-Blood visits. She’d had little reason to use the tape at all since receiving it from a fellow demigod at Camp, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t on her mind 24/7. Helena adored a good fight, and the idea of actually having one with a monster had her heart fluttering. 

She set to work, wrapping her fists in the gauze and tape. She had gotten quite good at it, as she did it pretty regularly for her boxing lessons three times a week. She never used the magical tape then of course, but it was essentially the same technique here. She finished wrapping her right hand, already having done her left, and bit the tape off before patting it down and examining her handiwork. She had gone a bit further up than she normally did, but she wanted her forearms to have some kind of protection just in case.

These preparations could all be for nothing, as Helena had no way of knowing if this was even related to demigod stuff, but she wasn’t worried about wasting the tape. It was enchanted to replenish itself every 24 hours, so no worries. Besides, it's not like it hurts anything to be a little cautious. She stood up, hurriedly pushing the stairwell door open and stepping out onto her floor. Their apartment was a few hallways down, so she had a little bit of time left to go through the possibilities while she made her way to it.

If it was a monster or something like that, Helena was confident she could take it. She was strong enough to tear a door off its hinges and break someone’s jaw on accident, any monster that could get into her apartment she could handle. She was more so worried about her mom. She had gotten home from work about a half-hour ago, more than likely, and she had absolutely no way to protect herself from anything magical. Even if the possible threat wasn’t magical, Helena didn’t like her mom’s chances. 

She sighed at the thought of her mom, eventually coming to a stop in front of their apartment door, #345. She wasn’t nervous per se, Helena had long gotten over any pre-competition jitters. She was worried about her mom obviously, but some part of her was more excited than anything. *I finally might get some action!* She pushed open the door, and was met with their dark living room.

Their apartment wasn’t gigantic, but it wasn’t cramped either. Helena’s mom made good money and came from good money, so if anything the two bedroom, 1,600 square foot apartment was living below their means. The room she was in now was the living room, which was separated from the not insignificantly sized kitchen by a countertop that reached just under Helena’s chest and had barstools lining the living room side of it. The living room itself was well-decorated and well-furnished with everything clearly being of high quality, particularly the vintage mahogany coffee table in the middle of it all. They lived well, and Helena was well aware of that fact. She quickly shifted her eyes over the room, and saw no sign of her mother or anyone else being there.

“Mom?” Her voice was frantic sounding, and anyone who heard it could tell she was worried. After no answer, she spoke again, “It looks like the entire building’s power is out. Are you alright?” She closed the door, and waited a moment for an answer. Two. When she got none after three, she opened her mouth to speak again, and was cut off by her mother’s voice.

“I’m fine, sweety. It went out a bit after I got home. Can you come in here and help me with something?” The amount of relief that flooded Helena’s brain when she heard her mother’s voice was rivaled only by the amount of disappointment. She was very happy her mother was okay, but she desperately had wanted it to be *something.* Her mother’s voice sounded fine, perhaps a bit off, but Helena just figured she was tired from work.

Helena threw her bags down on the couch, no longer on edge, and moved towards the hallway that contained her and her mother’s rooms. Just as she was about to enter the hallway, she stopped. Something was wrong. The moulding on the doorway to the hall, which was very high quality and her mother had basically forbidden her from teaching out of fear of her strength damaging it, was splintered. It was slight, and very high up, as though some really tall and very strong person had leaned against it for a moment, but it was definitely there. It was too high up to be either of them, and both Helena and her mom were tall, so it had to be someone else, and they had to be very strong.

“Mom, the moulding here is damaged.” Helena looked at it closely, a sense of dread and excitement filling her belly as she tried to piece together what was going on. Her mother answered, sounding almost exasperated, “Oh, is it? Well, oh well, it happens. Come in here please sweety, I really need a hand.” Helena was confused. Her mom should be fuming angry at this, and the fact it couldn’t have been Helena who had caused the damage made the situation all the more confusing. Why wasn’t her mom mad? Who had damaged it? Why wasn’t her mom worried about who damaged it?

Helena wasn’t good at puzzles, and she simply stood there staring at the moulding for a moment more before turning towards her mother’s door at the end of the hallway. Helena had never had much reason to be worried, or fear for her life. Much of the “demigod experience” had passed her by. Right now, though? Every instinct she had told her not to go through that door. The same instincts that told her when to punch, that told her when to roll, that told her when to take a deep breath, all of them were screaming at her not to listen to her mom. 

So she didn’t. “No. Come out here and look at this.” Helena’s voice was even and collected, but it had an edge to it that anyone listening for could hear. She was no longer entirely convinced she was even speaking to her mom at this point, and that thought turned her stomach. On the seemingly small chance that it might be her mom though, she didn’t want to say anything to upset her more than being told no already would. It seemed that “mom” was already well past upset though.

“No sweety, you come in here. I’ll look at it later.” The voice sounded more strained now, and Helena was nearly entirely convinced it wasn’t her mother she was speaking to. She stepped back from the hallway, if only to give herself more space in case whatever it was came crashing out of her mother’s room. She had to do something, if only to get whatever it was out in the open where she could kill it, and hopefully away from her mom, who she assumed was in the room with it. She didn’t even spare a moment to the intrusive thought that her mother might be dead.

“Come out, now. I know you aren’t my mom, and I have a feeling you’re here for me. The only way you’re going to get me is by coming out here and fighting me.” Her voice didn’t break or falter, and she stood unmoving as she waited for her words to be answered. When she heard the laughter, she felt her first moment of actual fear in the whole night.

It was the worst thing she had ever heard, like furniture scraping on hardwood but magnified strong enough to feel in her bones. She had seen those videos online that talked about how some large predators could make noises that had physical effects on their prey, freezing them in place. That’s what Helena felt like as she heard the laughter booming through her apartment. Like prey. When the laughter finally stopped after what felt like minutes, she was grateful for the silence. Said silence was shattered moments later by what was possibly the worst voice she had ever heard.

“Stupid little godling, making demands. I’ll come out and meet you, girl. If only for my own curiosity, though.” The voice still had that scraping effect that the laughter had possessed, however it sounded raspier and thicker, and its tone was condescending enough to replace some of Helena’s fear with anger. She didn’t like being insulted, and in her mind this thing didn’t know what it was dealing with. Helena could hear some nondescript shifting going on as the thing moved around, but what really got her were its footsteps. They were loud and heavy, each one like a sledgehammer on the hardwood. She tensed as they grew louder, signifying that whatever it was had finished its preparations, and was now moving towards the door.

As she heard it grab the door, and saw it begin to push open, she was surprised to find that the main emotion she was feeling was anticipation. The fear at the thing’s laughter was mostly gone, and though she was still worried about her mom, said worry was dwarfed by excitement at the prospect of the fight. As the door swung fully open, her excitement only grew, as did her worry.

It was a Cyclops. She had obviously never seen one, but the singular eye in the middle of its head was a good clue. As it moved further out of the room, its steps now louder and with that same booming quality, Helena was able to pick out more qualities. The thing was probably seven and a half feet tall, and obviously heavily muscled. Its shoulders looked like bowling balls, and its arms and legs both had a thickness to them that only the largest mortal bodybuilders could hope to match. Its face and head were covered by a thick mat of dark red hair that looked incredibly tangled and poorly maintained. Its clothes were clearly just whatever it could find lying around, and Helena quickly realised just how much like a homeless person he looked. It was definitely a he, as far as she could gather. The skin on his face was covered in blotches and blemishes, clearly from a lifetime spent roughing it. This thing had never had it easy.

Helena found it rather difficult to feel any pity for him though, as on his left shoulder he carried her mom, still in her work clothes, bound by sheets and gagged by one of her sock bundles. Her eyes looked at Helena panickily, and quickly motioned towards the apartment door, as if telling Helena to run. Her heart ached at her mother still looking out for her in this state, but Helena felt absolutely no desire to leave. No, seeing her mother in this state had only redoubled Helena’s resolve, as now she could be sure that her mother was okay, and could instead be angry at the monster for having put her in this state. She turned her eyes back to the monster, and found it smiling as it came to a stop right outside the hallway entrance, the spot Helena had been standing before moving to stand by the couch.

“I was right to be curious, though I can’t say I’m impressed. You smell like Hero god. I knew my nose wasn’t acting up.” The monster’s voice no longer sounded threatening to Helena, who was growing continuously more restless the longer she went without punching it. She smiled, determination and excitement showing on her face, and spoke clearly and loudly. “I don’t care what you have to say. Put my mother down, and let's do this.”

The monster looked almost offended, and made a mock guffawed face at her words. “My my, you really are an odd one. You don’t want to hear the story of how I found you? Of how I’ve been living in Fort Greene park for years now? Of how I’ve spent the last several months trying to find the demigod I just happened to smell one day?” The monster smiled, wiping the fake look of astonishment off of its face. “You don’t want to hear about how I cut the power and ambushed your mother? You should shower more, girl. This entire place stinks of godling, and I was near certain that-”

***WHAM***

Helena used her “Move” power to bridge the distance between herself and the monster, landing a massive blow hard into its jaw. She hated how much it was talking, and she needed to get it to drop her mother. She landed on her feet in a stance, ready to capitalise on whatever openings the attack had given her, or perhaps grab her mom and move her a safe distance instead. She looked up, ready to move.

Instead, she was met with the Cyclops grinning down on her, entirely unmoved by her blow. Helena had only a moment to be surprised before the monster’s massive right hand smacked her aside, sending her into the wall of the apartment. The wall held, as the impact was slowed by the decorative shelving that had been hung directly from the wall by her mom, however that didn’t make it hurt any less. She fell crumpled to the ground among the wreckage of the shelving, unsure of what had just happened, confused from the immediate pain.

Helena stood up from the impact, likely only being held together by the slightly increased durability her powers gave her, and watched through dazed vision as the cyclops tossed her mother onto the couch. She closed and opened her eyes over and over again, trying desperately to blink away the daze and get herself together. Her legs felt wobbly, her stomach was churning, and absolutely everything was in pain, especially her left side. In spite of all that though, she felt alive. She smiled as her vision and mind cleared, and she readied herself as the cyclops moved its way toward her, slowly, as if to ascertain how damaged she was.

As the Cyclops came within a meter of her, it stopped, smiling that horrific smile and showing off its poorly cared for teeth. “That was incredibly rude! Not letting me finish, just swinging away at me without purpose. You didn’t even ask me my name! It’s Adriaan by the way, thank you very much.” The monster shook its head in mock amazement, and rubbed its cheek where her blow had collided before speaking again. “I will say though, I’m impressed. You punch pretty hard. I’m gonna guess…Heracles?”

Helena was annoyed at the thing for talking so much, for not taking this seriously, and his rather astute guess at her parentage only turned said annoyance into rage. She yelled, shaking off the remainder of her daze and closing the distance between them. She slammed her left fist into the monster’s nose, not caring if it did hardly any damage. The monster took a step back, surprised by the force of the blow, and she pressed on, landing a series of blows onto the cyclops’ midsection. Helena winced with every blow, feeling like she was punching steel, but pressed on with her assault, she ducked a massive right hook from the creature that would have taken her head off, and brought her arms out to her side, slamming her closed fists on either side of the monster’s skull.

She felt alive! She felt great! This was it, this was what she had been missing. Boxing was great, wrestling was great, all her sports were great, but none of them gave her what she needed. A good fight. Boxing came the closest, but she was so much stronger than even the boys she fought, that it just never gave her any satisfaction when she won. This was different. She could die, her mom could die. Every blow was for keeps. She laughed gleefully as she began another assault on the monster with her wrapped fists, the tape tearing from the force of the impacts.

Just as she felt like she was getting the upper hand, she saw the cyclops roll its singular eye, a strange sight in and of itself, and catch her hand. It spoke, clearly frustrated at her determination. “This is all fine and good, but I need you to know something.” He brought his massive fist back, slamming it into Helena’s face with surprising speed. Her nose instantly broke, and Helena’s mouth began to fill with blood as she had nearly bitten through one of her cheeks and her lips had been busted open in multiple places. The only reason she wasn’t sent flying back was the monster holding her in place. It spoke again, its voice sounding satisfied at the damage he had wrought.

“This little heroic last stand is mighty impressive, but your punches barely hurt.” The massive creature took hold of her ponytail, lifting her into the air by it and letting her arm go limp to her side. Helena shrieked in pain as she felt like her scalp was going to come detached from her skull, though it came out as more of a gurgle with her mouth being so full of blood. The Cyclops chuckled as it lifted her into the air, amused by her pain. Helena’s mother screamed from the couch, having managed to spit the makeshift gag from her mouth and sitting up to watch the losing battle. The monster’s back was tuned to her, and so she couldn’t see the poor state of her daughter’s face.

Poor state indeed. Helena’s brain, already fuzzy from the multiple blows to the head she had suffered, screamed in pain just as she herself did. Her entire body ached, she was fairly certain some of the ribs on her left side were broken, and her broken nose and the multiple wounds in her mouth gushed blood at an almost concerning rate. She couldn’t think, she could barely keep her eyes open to watch as the cyclops prepared itself to disembowel her, or some other horrible thing. 

She was angry. She didn’t want to lose, she hated losing. Her and her mother’s lives being at stake were only in the back of her mind as her anger and desperation grew. Nothing mattered. Not the pain in her ribs, not the blood in her mouth, not the awful feeling of her scalp being torn off. The only thing that mattered was killing this thing, and winning. She was angry. She was so goddamn angry, not about dying, not about any of that bullshit, she was angry because she was going to lose. Her blood pressure rose, her ears grew hot, and the pain in her entire body fell into the background. Everything fell into focus, and she knew exactly what she had to do, where to focus her anger. She screamed, a loud, defiant sound that she could only barely process. Helena lifted her right hand in time with her yell, still wrapped in the celestial bronze tape, and stabbed it through the cyclops’ eye.

She felt the thing pop around her hand, which she had used like a knife to penetrate into the monster’s socket. Immediately the cyclops roared in pain and dropped her, stumbling back towards the couch as he did so. Helena landed on her feet, twisting her right ankle which immediately began to hurt, but she ignored it, entirely focused on the task at hand and too angry to care. She used her “Move” power to propel her body into the cyclops, lowering her head as she did so and slamming the top of her head into the face of the monster. 

She felt her head collide with the creature’s face, feeling its nose give way as the cartilage in it shattered. The impact probably would have shattered the bones of any normal person’s face, but the cyclops merely had its nose broken and was sent sprawling back, over the couch and falling onto the antique coffee table, which shattered under its significant weight. Helena’s head felt fuzzy for a moment, but the state she was currently in quickly focused things, and her rage and desperation drove her to ignore both it, and the pain in her ankle as she landed in a squat position. She leaped over the couch and her mother, who had laid down flat to avoid being hit by the sprawling monster and her daughter. The elder Roosevelt’s bindings had long since been wriggled out of, and she now had freedom of movement, which she used to watch as her daughter clambered onto the gigantic chest of the monster, mounting it and pinning its huge arms to the ground as best she could.

The monster was in a sorry state. Its now empty eye socket leaked gore and fluids. Its broken nose leaked the dust that she had been told that monsters become when they died. The creature was clearly in so much pain that it barely knew what was going on, and could probably barely even fight back at this point, but Helena didn’t care anymore. She wanted to win, and winning meant killing the thing.

So, she started to punch it. In the face, as hard as she could, over and over again, both hands. She yelled at the creature as she punched it, letting all her rage and desperation out.

***WHAM***

“What happened, huh?”

***WHAM***

“You were talking all that good shit earlier, and then I tore your fucking eye out!”

***WHAM***

“Get back up!”

***WHAM***

“We aren’t done yet!” Helena was vaguely aware of her mother yelling something to her, but she didn’t care.

***WHAM***

“Get back up and hit me!”

***WHAM***

Finally, she stopped hitting it, as she felt the state that she could enter when she was enraged begin to fade away. She knew she was breathing hard, could feel where the skin on her knuckles was now cracked open and bleeding in places, long since having come uncovered as the tape gave way to the strength of the blows. She could hear her mother saying something to her, felt her mom grabbing at her shoulders, but none of that mattered. She was smiling, near to laughing. She had won. She had so much fun. That was all she could think about before she passed out from the pain and exhaustion that the last few minutes had wrought. 

\*\*\*

*3 hours later…*

Corrine Roosevelt sighed from exertion as she was finally able to place her daughter into bed. After some minor fidgeting and adjusting of the blankets and pillows, she is finally satisfied at her daughter’s position, and leaves the room quietly, shutting off the light and closing the door softly behind her.

She huffed another, this time exasperated, sigh as she took in the state of her home. She had done some minor cleaning before finally getting Helena to her own bed and off the couch, but nothing major. Honestly, it had been a miracle things hadn’t ended up worse. The monster had been remarkably gentle after picking the lock to their apartment, only slightly damaging the moulding on the entrance to the hallway. 

It had gotten the jump on Corinne, who had been sitting in her room alone when it cut off the power. She had figured it was just an exceptionally large homeless man at first, but when it began asking her questions about her daughter and “godling smell,” she knew it was a monster that her mortal eyes simply couldn’t process. It had tied up and gagged Corinne after initially interrogating and threatening her, saying it was just going to wait until the demigod showed up.

Corrine was so scared for her daughter, and during the actual fight itself that was even more so the case. Helena had seemed so damn determined to throw herself at the monster, and never once did she take a moment to consider her own safety. Some part of Corrine was proud of Helena for her bravery and perseverance, but the other part of her was terrified that her daughter would get herself killed.

That wasn’t even the worst part, though. The most concerning part was how happy Helena had been throughout it all. Her daughter had been losing most of the fight, and yet she had been smiling throughout the vast majority of it. It wasn’t right, and it really did make Corrine scared for how exactly Helena’s parentage might be affecting her mindset. Corrine shook her head, refusing to think about her ex longer than she needed to.

She got to work, picking up pieces of broken glass or splintered wood and push-brooming it all into a pile in the corner of the apartment. The cleanup honestly wouldn’t take that long, so long as the power came back on in a speedy manner. The monster had cut it before entering the building, and it seemed able to will the rest of the tenants to stay in their rooms somehow. She wasn’t sure how it all worked, but she was just glad they were all going to be okay, especially Helena.

Her daughter’s injuries were severe enough to merit a doctor visit for most, but Helena had fought her very hard to remain on the couch, and Corrine simply couldn’t win when her daughter put her foot down physically. She grabbed the nectar and ambrosia her daughter kept locked in her room for special needs, and applied both rather liberally, with half-asleep Helena supervising and informing her when she had had enough. The girl had then quickly fallen back into an unconscious slumber, not even waking when Corrine had moved her from the couch and into her own room.

It could have been so much worse. That is all Corrine kept telling herself. Helena’s injuries were severe, especially the head trauma, but manageable with good bedrest and the proper application of that healing food she was using. Even still, it was hard to feel thankful as she looked around at their broken and dirty apartment. Her antique coffee table was smashed, multiple pictures and knick-knacks had been broken when Helena had been tossed into the wall, and the hardwood floor was splintered in multiple places, particularly where Helena had beaten the cyclops to death. Corrine still shivered at the memory.

Watching her daughter slam her bleeding and bruised hands into the face of what looked to Corrine like a human being had been incredibly difficult, made even worse by Helena’s angry taunting and gleeful expression. It made one thing absolutely clear: Helena had loved every moment of that battle, and that was a terrifying thought.

I was talking to a buddy the other day and we kinda realized there’s a ""type"" for every beard. Not saying it’s a strict rule or anything...

* **The Big, Burly Viking Beard** – This dude lifts, drinks black coffee, and probably has an axe in his garage for no real reason. Might also do strongman training or at least talk about it a lot.
* **The Tight, Trimmed Corporate Beard** – Got a 9-5, wears a lot of button-ups, beard stays exactly 2mm long at all times. Probably listens to finance podcasts and drinks oat milk lattes.
* **The Goatee Guy** – 50/50 shot he either plays in a cover band or works in IT. No in-between.
* **The Patchy Beard Warrior** – Absolute legend, refuses to give up despite genetics tryna humble him. Uses every oil and supplement under the sun. “It’s just slow-growing” is his mantra.
* **The Mustache Purist** – He’s different. Watches old movies, thrifts his clothes, definitely owns some form of a tobacco pipe even if he doesn’t use it.

Obv not everyone fits into a neat little box, but idk man, I swear I can almost guess what a guy’s like just based on his beard. Maybe I’m just overthinking it but tell me I’m wrong lol",0,1743515479.0,BeardTalk,3,0.5,False

1jow1q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1jow1q0/what_would_you_charge_for_this_fullservice/,What would you charge for this? Full-service content creation for a top real estate agent.,"For the past several months, full-service content creation has been provided to a high-performing real estate agent who shifted her marketing to a social-first strategy. The entire process — from planning and strategy to filming, editing, and posting — has been managed solo.

On average each month, responsibilities include:
	•	Producing 24–30 short-form videos (Reels)
	•	Creating a full monthly content strategy + calendar
	•	Outlining scripts/talking points
	•	Filming all content in person
	•	Editing all videos (jump cuts, captions, transitions, music)
	•	Writing SEO-optimized captions
	•	Creating hashtag strategy
	•	Scheduling and publishing content
	•	Ongoing client communication, revisions, and support

1–2 in-person shoot days per week are typically scheduled, covering:
	•	Property listings + home tours
	•	Small business spotlights
	•	Fundraisers + community events
	•	Coffee shops, restaurants, bookstores
	•	Behind-the-scenes content
	•	Personal brand and lifestyle moments
	•	Collaborations with local partners (e.g., stagers, lenders, vendors)

This workload averages 70–80 hours/month, with an expectation to not exceed 80. As a result, work has occasionally gone unbilled or certain tasks have been deprioritized in order to stay within that limit — which has started to feel unsustainable.

Looking for guidance on:
	•	What others would charge per hour or as a monthly package for this kind of high-touch, high-volume content creation
	•	How others would package or structure this type of service
	•	Any advice for setting healthy boundaries while still delivering high-quality work

Thanks in advance for any feedback — this is part of a broader effort to restructure offerings and build a more sustainable business model.


TL;DR: Full-service content creation is being provided for a top real estate agent — 24–30 Reels per month, including strategy, filming, editing, captions, and scheduling. The workload averages 70–80 hours/month, with an expectation not to exceed 80. This has led to pressure to stay under, occasional unbilled time, and questions around sustainability.

Frankly, I had a crap childhood (who didn't?) and sneaking letters in and out of the mailbox was about the only act of rebellion I was brave enough for. 

I don't talk to them anymore. I don't talk to many people at all anymore. You should know upfront that I don't have anything interesting to talk (or write) about. 

I don't travel. Or, more accurately, I can't travel. I'm broke-broke. My job is boring. I don't have many, if any, hobbies. I work out some but not enthusiastically. I read. Scratch that. I listen to other people read. And honestly it's (almost) exclusively smut. I have a degree but I'm not particularly smart. I don't follow politics. Or art. Or music. Or really anything. And yes, I actually like Starbucks. Shoot me. I'm textbook basic. I should be sorry I sold my soul to megacorp instead of supporting my local coffee shop. But damnit an $8 coffee with too many adjectives in it's name really does it for me some days. 

Today wasn't one of those days. My brain is still on. So, I ended up here, flicking through interesting people looking for other interesting people, writing a long, rambly (is that even a word?) and probably bitter sounding post. 

I just miss looking forward to checking the mail. I want to WANT TO check the mail, you know? I don't care if you don't have anything cool or fun or witty to say. I just hope you won't axe murder me once you get my address. I'm willing to negotiate with stranglers (kidding, kidding... mostly.)

For what it's worth, besides probably boring you to death, I'm harmless. And I solemnly vow not to axe murder you either. Promise.

Is there a best time to book these? Will MCE or even first/business class upgrades come down in price the closer I get to departure?

I've heard that if I book the row & window seat, that the middle seat will be given away as an upgrade so I should just get our seats next to each other. Is this true?

January 19th, 2020. 8AM. Portland, Oregon.

The receptionist at Cryotek, Leeta, sat down to type up a manifest report on all the visitors from the day before. This was a typical morning task, nothing out of the ordinary, and something she had done a thousand times. Having worked at Cryotek for three years, she had yet to move up in the organization, but she also wasn't trying to, either. Working here was great because it was a part-time job that offered stable hours while she attended classes at the University of Portland.

As Leeta rapidly typed up a list, she paused to look around the lobby. There was only one person here, this early in the morning, and he was just some businessman waiting for an assessment appointment for a future entry into the second or third round of cryo-storage, assuming the first round went well. Unfortunately, due to delays forced by the recent arrest of that Jason Hiro terrorist guy, Cryotek had faced increased government scrutiny and put off its first batch of cryogenic freezing for a few weeks. A lot of people were angry, but through some carefully worded emails the company was able to squeak by with minimal blowback.

Still, Leeta was annoyed. She had planned to enjoy several weeks off once the company shut down future sign-ups to monitor the first batch of participants. It would be at least two or three more weeks until she enjoyed her impromptu vacation.

As she sat there, typing at over a hundred words per minute and sulking in the back of her mind, the main doors opened, and a muscular man wearing a black suit, sunglasses, and a wide-brimmed hat walked in. He glanced around the lobby, then looked at Leeta before heading toward her. Leeta pushed her annoyance aside and beamed a smile at him.

""Good morning, sir. Do you have an appointment?""

The man didn't smile back. He reached into his back pocket and pulled out his wallet, then flashed a badge at her.

""Agent Ryan Lederman, South Carolina Special Division. I'm here today to ask some questions regarding the recent arrest of a young man inside Cryotek. Could you direct me to someone in charge?""

Leeta blinked. ""Of course. Rebecca Langley is our head researcher. She should have access to that information, and clearance to answer your questions.""

The man frowned slightly. ""Mmm. Is there, perhaps, a man in charge?""

Leeta couldn't help herself. Her smile deflated instantly.

Of COURSE this _asshole_ had to be some big macho tough guy misogynist. It was clear he thought women couldn't lead or do anything themselves. Guys like this were the bane of every woman's existence, and it was obvious just by looking at him he was some meathead who thought only men could run businesses. Leeta was tempted to immediately call Rebecca out, have her give him a piece of her mind, but Leeta thought better of it. She decided to just ignore his misogyny and resist the urge to roll her eyes.

""...We have Doctor Reginald in the back. He's the other Head Researcher, but-""

""That's fine."" Ryan said, looking around the lobby. ""As long as it's a man. Don't really have time to chit-chat about nails and whatever.""

Leeta nearly blew a fuse. She had to fight against the demons in her heart lest she explode in rage at this piece of work, and it took all her self control to silently press the button on her phone system, dial Head Researcher Reginald's office, and ask him through gritted teeth if he had time to speak to this _fine upstanding gentleman._ Luckily, Reginald came out and ushered Ryan into his office before Leeta lost her temper.

This time, when Leeta returned to tapping on the keyboard, her fingers impacted the keys with the angry force of a jackhammer. Even the businessman in the suit across the lobby glanced at her, noticing how much louder her typing had become as she deliberately vented her anger on the keyboard.

Not twenty minutes later, Agent Ryan exited the office. He walked past Leeta without saying a word, as if the existence of a woman had disappeared from his mind once she was out of sight and mind.

""Have. A. Nice. Day."" Leeta said, biting the words off at him as he strode toward the front door.

Ryan didn't even pause. ""Yeah, thanks.""

...

Outside, Ryan walked away from the Cryotek building in a calm and measured manner. After walking down a few side streets, he turned into a coffee shop and sat down, taking off his sunglasses and pressing his finger to his lips.

""Hmm. So his name was Jason Hiro. Assigned to cryosleep through a randomized clinical trial. Expressed interest in quitting the program, according to what Seymour told me. The security cameras showed a plain black truck took him, but they didn't look government-issued. Certainly not FBI. The MO doesn't match the Knights Templar. That leaves the Illuminati. Damn. They must have taken the kid to their base out east. But why? To what end?""

Ryan chewed his nail for a few minutes, mulling various thoughts in his mind.

""...There's no other choice. I have to infiltrate their base. But I'm a known asset. They probably have men and women mixed together in and out of uniform. Cameras everywhere. Security precautions and alarms and other human tech I won't understand. It won't be as easy as it was just twenty or thirty years ago. I can't keep up with the humans' rate of advancements these days...""

'Ryan' closed his eyes and massaged his forehead.

""Two options. I either try to sneak in quietly, or I go the loud route. The Illuminati is formidable, and they can definitely beat back a single Emperor with the options at their disposal, but the problem is the kid. _Jason Hiro_. Come on, the name itself seems to imply... no, wouldn't that be too on the nose? Hiro? _Hero_? Could he be a Trueborn? Did his parents have an ironic naming sense, or was it just karma and luck or something? Bah, it's going to be a serious problem if he _is_ a Hero. Satan will not be happy.""

""So if I go in loud, maybe they evacuate Jason with some underground route. Even if I knock everyone out, he might be long gone. Not to mention, if they picked him up, they must have detected his Heroic Energy. Maybe he's already started using his powers. What abilities does he have? Is he a weakling, or a powerhouse?""

As it turned out, this 'Agent Ryan' was merely one of Belial's casual disguises. She didn't even bother looking up a real government agency. By the time anyone figured out someone unauthorized had viewed the security cameras, she would be long gone, and all the blame would be pinned on Head Researcher Reginald. Poor guy might even get fired, not that she cared.

""I shouldn't approach this mission alone."" Belial muttered to herself, remaining in her 'secret agent' disguise. ""I need backup. When it comes to bypassing human tech, there's only one valid option. It has to be Ose. She's a bit bratty, but she's reliable when it comes to this stuff. I should also bring along... yeah, that would work. Just in case things go badly and we need to get loud. It's always good to have a backup option.""

A waitress approached Belial. ""Excuse me sir, would you like any coffee?""

""Fuck off."" Belial said, not even bothering to look at the woman.

""Ah! Well, fine then, asshole. Jesus."" The waitress said, storming away in a huff.

It wasn't that Belial was usually rude to women, but just in case she was being followed, she needed to maintain her disguise. This persona of 'Ryan Lederman' was a misogynist who only talked to men, so it was best if she always ignored and downplayed women when opportunities arose.

Belial sat for a while longer, formulating a plan. Then, she stood up, walked out, and waved for a taxi.

...................................

January 19th, 2020. 2PM. Seattle, Washington.

""Big Brian! Ahhh!!! I'm SUCH a huge fan! You're soooo hot!!!""

A woman screamed in glee as her favorite rockstar walked past, a mountain of a man wearing a black leather jacket seemingly taken right out of an 80's rock band. The man proudly stomped forward, his giant feet leaving faint imprints on the floor as he maneuvered his eight-foot-tall frame around the back halls of the concert area. Big Brian shot the woman a goofy smile and nodded. ""Well shucks, thanks for the compliment, toots! You ain't lookin' so bad yourself!""

He gave the woman a huge thumbs up, and she screamed in delight even louder. Next to the woman were hundreds of other people, all held behind a short fence to keep them from rushing the A-list celebrity. Big Brian had been on a comeback tour along with some of his old bandmates, as well as a few new faces. Naturally, while most of the fanbase was on the 40+ side of the age curve, there were still some younger fans who also thought he was cool in a way only people of an older generation could be.

Camera's whirred and clicked, bathing Big Brian and his bandmates in a series of white flashes. Behind him, Shatter and Screamer walked, a longtime brother and sister duo who were getting up there in years, yet still seemed to age extremely gracefully. Screamer in particular looked as attractive as many modern twenty-year old performers, seeming as if she hadn't aged a day. She wore black lipstick and had a somewhat gothic appearance, but her moodiness didn't deter an avalanche of men from constantly sending her fanmail.

Shatter on the other hand sported a huge head of frizzy white hair. He constantly stuck his tongue out and made crazy faces at the nearby fans as he walked, shouting his iconic catch phrases like ""Shatter the heavens!!"" and ""Burn us down to hell!!""

As they strode past the fans, their security detail kept a careful watch out. One could never be too sure if some psycho would threaten the talent's lives, and there was always the danger of a smuggled handgun or an explosive that could bring tragedy to an otherwise positive event.

Eventually, the performers left the concert hall, went backstage, and entered their dressing rooms. Big Brian cracked his back after they closed the door and secured the area.

""Ohh, man! That was a great concert, Shax! You were on fire tonight!""

""You too, Bael!"" Shax laughed back. ""You beat those drums like your life depended on it. I was having trouble keeping up with you!""

The trio touched their rings and reverted their false human appearances, revealing their demonic forms. Bael, Shax, and Murmur regained their red skin, feeling no different than when their disguises were activated. Still, they preferred to be in their demon forms, since that felt a little more natural.

""Murmur, you doin' okay?"" Bael asked, leaning down to her level. ""You're a little quieter than usual.""

Murmur levitated on top of her big brother's shoulder. She was extremely short, less than three feet tall to her brother's seven foot stature. Their heights didn't change when in human form, so it was a distinct contrast that helped make their band look unique, even in simple silhouettes on promotional material.

""It's nothing."" Murmur said quietly. ""Just... a creepy guy. Kept calling me 'little girl.' I didn't like it.""

Bael's smile soured. ""What? So there was some punk thinkin' weird thoughts? What he look like? I'll straighten him right out!""

Murmur crossed her arms and looked away. ""I'll do it myself. Later. Just not in the mood right now.""

""Oh. Okay."" Bael said, lowering his fists. ""Well, look, I'm pretty hungry. Whaddya guys say we go get some Mexican food, huh?""

While it was true that demons often _enjoyed_ eating the flesh of humans, as it happened, human food was so delicious that many demons opted to try out their cuisine occasionally, or even regularly. Bael was one of the more prolific cases.

""I'm not in the mood for any food."" Shax said. ""I'm gonna go nap for a bit. My throat's kinda worn out, man.""

Murmur shrugged. ""I'll go.""

""Hell yeah!"" Bael said. ""Let's go, Murmur! Food time! Food time! Food time!""

Murmur levitated off Shax's shoulder, then fiddled with her ring to return to her human appearance. She looked like a dwarf human, but also sort of like a cute little girl in her teens, albeit much shorter than the average. After Bael reverted back to his human state, the two of them headed into their personal changing areas to swap clothing. Bael donned a giant black T-shirt with a skull and crossbones on the front, while Murmur ended up putting on a simple black sundress. She didn't like dressing up, and always opted to wear rather basic clothing when out and about.

After the duo finished changing clothes, Bael took Murmur's hand, and the two of them left the dressing room, flanked by their security. In order not to draw much attention, they first surveyed a path without fans, sneaked out the back, and got inside a black SUV. Their driver drove them over to a Mexican restaurant, and allowed them to leave, alone. Naturally, bodyguards surveyed the perimeter, but they made sure to give Bael and Murmur space so they wouldn't attract attention inside. They had no way of knowing that a random psycho with a gun had zero chance of causing these two any harm, but they still had to make sure their assigned talents stayed safe.

After entering the restaurant, Bael squeezed his huge body into a small chair, while Murmur sat opposite him, her head barely able to peek over the table. She blushed slightly out of embarrassment before asking for a booster seat. But then again, she was used to having to do this.

""Alright,"" Bael said, after looking at the menu for five minutes. ""Waiter guy! I'll take a plate of this stuff, this stuff, this soupy stuff, this, this, three of these, and... you know what? This looks good too. What about you, _Screamer_?""

Murmur handed the menu back to the waiter. ""A plate of fajitas for me.""

The waiter took their order, then gave Bael a long, serious look. He alone had just ordered more than $400 worth of food. Was he seriously going to eat it all? Maybe they had more friends on the way.

But the waiter decided not to question anything. ""Si, senor. Give us ten minutes for the Fajitas, and... do you want all your food at once, senor?""

""Nah, just bring it out as you cook it."" Bael said. ""I'll be eating for a while.""

""Oh. Alright then, you are the boss, senor."" The waiter said, before walking away scratching his head and muttering something under his breath.

Naturally, Bael and Murmur heard his muttered words, but they didn't care. He was just some unimportant human. His opinions didn't matter at all.

Murmur looked around the restaurant. Surprisingly, she and Bael were the only people there, despite being in the middle of the day on a Sunday. It was rather bizarre. Maybe the restaurant wasn't doing too well financially and would soon go out of business? She had no idea.

While they waited for their food to arrive, Bael smiled at her.

""Somethin's on your mind, I can tell."" Bael said. ""Hit me. What's up?""

Murmur lowered her eyes. She sighed.

""Bael... I...""

She paused.

""First, promise not to tell Shax. Not yet.""

Bael's smile slipped. ""Uh... sure. But why not?""

Murmur's toes fidgeted under the table.

""Because... I... want to quit the band.""

Bael's jaw dropped. ""W-what? No way! You're kiddin'. Why, Murmur? You've got the voice of an angel.""

""I only sing because Shax likes it."" Murmur muttered. ""But _I_ don't like singing. I like being around Shax. He's always there. He makes me feel safe. But this whole... band thing. We've been doing it for so long. I'm tired of it. I want to do something else.""

Bael looked at her, crestfallen. ""Come on, sister. Whaddya mean? What else could you possibly wanna do?""

Murmur didn't immediately answer. She fell silent as the waiter returned with her plate of fajitas, as well as Bael's first entree, which turned out to be three gigantic burritos covered in red sauce and onions.

After the waiter left, Murmur speared some of her veggies and meat. She silently bit into the delicious fajitas, savoring their hot and crispy texture while giving herself time to think.

""I'm not sure."" She eventually said, answering Bael's previous question. ""Maybe... painting? I want to try painting.""

Bael nodded. He shoved part of the first burrito in his mouth and took a huge bite, horking down a third of it instantly. Red sauce ran down his face, but he didn't notice. He chewed loudly in a lip-smacking manner that would disgust most people, but which Murmur had long grown used to, then he finished off the rest of the burrito in two more bites.

""Mmm! I mean, painting's cool. It's cool!"" Bael said, being surprisingly careful not to spit burrito debris all over Murmur's side of the table. ""You think you'll be any good??""

""I don't know."" Murmur said, her voice lowering slightly. ""It's not about 'being good' for me. I just think it would be fun. More fun than singing. I don't like singing. I just don't know how to tell Shax. He's... he's going to feel so sad. I don't want to make him sad.""

Bael paused his eating. He noticed a hint of depression on Murmur's face. It slowly sunk into his thick skull that this situation wasn't as simple as he previously thought.

Slowly, very very slowly, the gears of something approaching 'thoughts' whirred inside Bael's head. He looked at Murmur with slightly glazed eyes, trying to think of something smart to say.

Then, like a bolt of lightning, it hit him! The perfect response!

""Ehh, he'll get over it."" Bael said, waving his hand flippantly. ""It ain't that big a deal. We're demons. You can always come back someday. Do another tour. You just do your painting, girl. Don't let nobody tell you otherwise!""

Murmur frowned. She daintily ate another forkful of peppers and steak.

""But... Shax loves when I sing."" Murmur said, looking at Bael with hopeful eyes. ""How can we break the news to him?""

""Maaan, you're overthinking this."" Bael said, rolling his eyes. ""Seriously, it ain't no big deal, Murmur. Look, we just find another demon girl who likes singing, yeah? We'll just say you're retirin' or whatever, say we got a new talent lined up, boom! Easy! Besides, you gonna go live somewhere else?""

Murmur slowly shook her head. ""No... I'll still be here.""

""Great! Then you'll come to the concerts?""

She nodded again. ""Yes...""

""Then what's the problem??"" Bael asked. ""You ain't fallin' off the face of the Earth! You'll just be chillin' in the dressing room, paintin' up a storm. Easy. We'll miss havin' ya on stage, but you can always come back if the paintin' thing don't work out.""

""Oh."" Murmur said, smiling shyly. ""I guess I was overthinking things. Not much is going to change. Thanks, Bael. You're such a smart guy.""

Bael snorted. ""Let's not go _too_ far now.""

The door to the Mexican restaurant opened. Murmur turned her head in the direction of the man who entered, then frowned. He wore a black suit, sunglasses, and a wide-brimmed hat, but secretly, she felt a mild current of demonic energy thanks to a resonance spike within her own disguise ring.

The man walked over to their table, and Bael lifted his head, only now noticing the new arrival.

""The hell? Don't even THINK of touching my food, pal!"" Bael snapped, giving this newcomer a mean look.

""I'm not interested in your food, Bael."" The man said, before turning to Murmur and winking. 

""Hey Murmur. Since you're here, guess I can invite you as well. Would you two like to go on a little... _road trip_?""",7,1743514701.0,HFY,3,0.89,False

The receptionist at Cryotek, Leeta, sat down to type up a manifest report on all the visitors from the day before. This was a typical morning task, nothing out of the ordinary, and something she had done a thousand times. Having worked at Cryotek for three years, she had yet to move up in the organization, but she also wasn't trying to, either. Working here was great because it was a part-time job that offered stable hours while she attended classes at the University of Portland.

As Leeta rapidly typed up a list, she paused to look around the lobby. There was only one person here, this early in the morning, and he was just some businessman waiting for an assessment appointment for a future entry into the second or third round of cryo-storage, assuming the first round went well. Unfortunately, due to delays forced by the recent arrest of that Jason Hiro terrorist guy, Cryotek had faced increased government scrutiny and put off its first batch of cryogenic freezing for a few weeks. A lot of people were angry, but through some carefully worded emails the company was able to squeak by with minimal blowback.

Still, Leeta was annoyed. She had planned to enjoy several weeks off once the company shut down future sign-ups to monitor the first batch of participants. It would be at least two or three more weeks until she enjoyed her impromptu vacation.

As she sat there, typing at over a hundred words per minute and sulking in the back of her mind, the main doors opened, and a muscular man wearing a black suit, sunglasses, and a wide-brimmed hat walked in. He glanced around the lobby, then looked at Leeta before heading toward her. Leeta pushed her annoyance aside and beamed a smile at him.

""Good morning, sir. Do you have an appointment?""

The man didn't smile back. He reached into his back pocket and pulled out his wallet, then flashed a badge at her.

""Agent Ryan Lederman, South Carolina Special Division. I'm here today to ask some questions regarding the recent arrest of a young man inside Cryotek. Could you direct me to someone in charge?""

Leeta blinked. ""Of course. Rebecca Langley is our head researcher. She should have access to that information, and clearance to answer your questions.""

The man frowned slightly. ""Mmm. Is there, perhaps, a man in charge?""

Leeta couldn't help herself. Her smile deflated instantly.

Of COURSE this _asshole_ had to be some big macho tough guy misogynist. It was clear he thought women couldn't lead or do anything themselves.

Leeta was tempted to immediately call Rebecca out, have her give him a piece of her mind, but Leeta thought better of it. She decided to just ignore his misogyny and resist the urge to roll her eyes.

""...We have Doctor Reginald in the back. He's the other Head Researcher, but-""

""That's fine."" Ryan said, looking around the lobby. ""As long as it's a man. Don't really have time to chit-chat about nails and whatever.""

Leeta nearly blew a fuse. She had to fight against the demons in her heart lest she explode in rage at this piece of work, and it took all her self control to silently press the button on her phone system, dial Head Researcher Reginald's office, and ask him through gritted teeth if he had time to speak to this _fine upstanding gentleman._ Luckily, Reginald came out and ushered Ryan into his office before Leeta lost her temper.

This time, when Leeta returned to tapping on the keyboard, her fingers impacted the keys with the angry force of a jackhammer. Even the businessman in the suit across the lobby glanced at her, noticing how much louder her typing had become as she deliberately vented her anger on the keyboard.

Not twenty minutes later, Agent Ryan exited the office. He walked past Leeta without saying a word, as if the existence of a woman had disappeared from his mind once she was out of sight and mind.

""Have. A. Nice. Day."" Leeta said, biting the words off at him as he strode toward the front door.

Ryan didn't even pause. ""Yeah, thanks.""

...

Outside, Ryan walked away from the Cryotek building in a calm and measured manner. After walking down a few side streets, he turned into a coffee shop and sat down, taking off his sunglasses and pressing his finger to his lips.

""Hmm. So his name was Jason Hiro. Assigned to cryosleep through a randomized clinical trial. Expressed interest in quitting the program, according to what Seymour told me. The security cameras showed a plain black truck took him, but they didn't look government-issued. Certainly not FBI. The MO doesn't match the Knights Templar. That leaves the Illuminati. Damn.

Ryan chewed his nail for a few minutes, mulling various thoughts in his mind.

""...There's no other choice. I have to infiltrate their base. But I'm a known asset. They probably have men and women mixed together in and out of uniform. Cameras everywhere. Security precautions and alarms and other human tech I won't understand. It won't be as easy as it was just twenty or thirty years ago. I can't keep up with the humans' rate of advancements these days...""

'Ryan' closed his eyes and massaged his forehead.

""Two options. I either try to sneak in quietly, or I go the loud route. The Illuminati is formidable, and they can definitely beat back a single Emperor with the options at their disposal, but the problem is the kid. _Jason Hiro_. Come on, the name itself seems to imply... no, wouldn't that be too on the nose? Hiro? _Hero_? Could he be a Trueborn? Did his parents have an ironic naming sense, or was it just karma and luck or something? Bah, it's going to be a serious problem if he _is_ a Hero. Satan will not be happy.""

""So if I go in loud, maybe they evacuate Jason with some underground route. Even if I knock everyone out, he might be long gone. Not to mention, if they picked him up, they must have detected his Heroic Energy. Maybe he's already started using his powers. What abilities does he have? Is he a weakling, or a powerhouse?""

As it turned out, this 'Agent Ryan' was merely one of Belial's casual disguises. She didn't even bother looking up a real government agency. By the time anyone figured out someone unauthorized had viewed the security cameras, she would be long gone, and all the blame would be pinned on Head Researcher Reginald. Poor guy might even get fired, not that she cared.

""I shouldn't approach this mission alone."" Belial muttered to herself, remaining in her 'secret agent' disguise. ""I need backup. When it comes to bypassing human tech, there's only one valid option. It has to be Ose. She's a bit bratty, but she's reliable when it comes to this stuff. I should also bring along... yeah, that would work. Just in case things go badly and we need to get loud. It's always good to have a backup option.""

A waitress approached Belial. ""Excuse me sir, would you like any coffee?""

""Fuck off."" Belial said, not even bothering to look at the woman.

""Ah! Well, fine then, asshole. Jesus."" The waitress said, storming away in a huff.

It wasn't that Belial was usually rude to women, but just in case she was being followed, she needed to maintain her disguise. This persona of 'Ryan Lederman' was a misogynist who only talked to men, so it was best if she always ignored and downplayed women when opportunities arose.

Belial sat for a while longer, formulating a plan. Then, she stood up, walked out, and waved for a taxi.

...................................

January 19th, 2020. 2PM. Seattle, Washington.

""Big Brian! Ahhh!!! I'm SUCH a huge fan! You're soooo hot!!!""

A woman screamed in glee as her favorite rockstar walked past, a mountain of a man wearing a black leather jacket seemingly taken right out of an 80's rock band. The man proudly stomped forward, his giant feet leaving faint imprints on the floor as he maneuvered his eight-foot-tall frame around the back halls of the concert area. Big Brian shot the woman a goofy smile and nodded. ""Well shucks, thanks for the compliment, toots! You ain't lookin' so bad yourself!""

He gave the woman a huge thumbs up, and she screamed in delight even louder. Next to the woman were hundreds of other people, all held behind a short fence to keep them from rushing the A-list celebrity. Big Brian had been on a comeback tour along with some of his old bandmates, as well as a few new faces. Naturally, while most of the fanbase was on the 40+ side of the age curve, there were still some younger fans who also thought he was cool in a way only people of an older generation could be.

Camera's whirred and clicked, bathing Big Brian and his bandmates in a series of white flashes. Behind him, Shatter and Screamer walked, a longtime brother and sister duo who were getting up there in years, yet still seemed to age extremely gracefully. Screamer in particular looked as attractive as many modern twenty-year old performers, seeming as if she hadn't aged a day. She wore black lipstick and had a somewhat gothic appearance, but her moodiness didn't deter an avalanche of men from constantly sending her fanmail.

Shatter on the other hand sported a huge head of frizzy white hair. He constantly stuck his tongue out and made crazy faces at the nearby fans as he walked, shouting his iconic catch phrases like ""Shatter the heavens!!"" and ""Burn us down to hell!!""

As they strode past the fans, their security detail kept a careful watch out. One could never be too sure if some psycho would threaten the talent's lives, and there was always the danger of a smuggled handgun or an explosive that could bring tragedy to an otherwise positive event.

Eventually, the performers left the concert hall, went backstage, and entered their dressing rooms. Big Brian cracked his back after they closed the door and secured the area.

""Ohh, man! That was a great concert, Shax! You were on fire tonight!""

""You too, Bael!"" Shax laughed back. ""You beat those drums like your life depended on it. I was having trouble keeping up with you!""

The trio touched their rings and reverted their false human appearances, revealing their demonic forms. Bael, Shax, and Murmur regained their red skin, feeling no different than when their disguises were activated. Still, they preferred to be in their demon forms, since that felt a little more natural.

""Murmur, you doin' okay?"" Bael asked, leaning down to her level. ""You're a little quieter than usual.""

Murmur levitated on top of her big brother's shoulder. She was extremely short, less than three feet tall to her brother's seven foot stature. Their heights didn't change when in human form, so it was a distinct contrast that helped make their band look unique, even in simple silhouettes on promotional material.

""It's nothing."" Murmur said quietly. ""Just... a creepy guy. Kept calling me 'little girl.' I didn't like it.""

Bael's smile soured. ""What? So there was some punk thinkin' weird thoughts? What he look like? I'll straighten him right out!""

Murmur crossed her arms and looked away. ""I'll do it myself. Later. Just not in the mood right now.""

""Oh. Okay."" Bael said, lowering his fists. ""Well, look, I'm pretty hungry. Whaddya guys say we go get some Mexican food, huh?""

While it was true that demons often _enjoyed_ eating the flesh of humans, as it happened, human food was so delicious that many demons opted to try out their cuisine occasionally, or even regularly. Bael was one of the more prolific cases.

""I'm not in the mood for any food."" Shax said. ""I'm gonna go nap for a bit. My throat's kinda worn out, man.""

Murmur shrugged. ""I'll go.""

""Hell yeah!"" Bael said. ""Let's go, Murmur! Food time! Food time! Food time!""

Murmur levitated off Shax's shoulder, then fiddled with her ring to return to her human appearance. She looked like a dwarf human, but also sort of like a cute little girl in her teens, albeit much shorter than the average. After Bael reverted back to his human state, the two of them headed into their personal changing areas to swap clothing. Bael donned a giant black T-shirt with a skull and crossbones on the front, while Murmur ended up putting on a simple black sundress. She didn't like dressing up, and always opted to wear rather basic clothing when out and about.

After the duo finished changing clothes, Bael took Murmur's hand, and the two of them left the dressing room, flanked by their security. In order not to draw much attention, they first surveyed a path without fans, sneaked out the back, and got inside a black SUV. Their driver drove them over to a Mexican restaurant, and allowed them to leave, alone. Naturally, bodyguards surveyed the perimeter, but they made sure to give Bael and Murmur space so they wouldn't attract attention inside. They had no way of knowing that a random psycho with a gun had zero chance of causing these two any harm, but they still had to make sure their assigned talents stayed safe.

After entering the restaurant, Bael squeezed his huge body into a small chair, while Murmur sat opposite him, her head barely able to peek over the table. She blushed slightly out of embarrassment before asking for a booster seat. But then again, she was used to having to do this.

""Alright,"" Bael said, after looking at the menu for five minutes. ""Waiter guy! I'll take a plate of this stuff, this stuff, this soupy stuff, this, this, three of these, and... you know what? This looks good too. What about you, _Screamer_?""

Murmur handed the menu back to the waiter. ""A plate of fajitas for me.""

The waiter took their order, then gave Bael a long, serious look. He alone had just ordered more than $400 worth of food. Was he seriously going to eat it all? Maybe they had more friends on the way.

But the waiter decided not to question anything. ""Si, senor. Give us ten minutes for the Fajitas, and... do you want all your food at once, senor?""

""Nah, just bring it out as you cook it."" Bael said. ""I'll be eating for a while.""

""Oh. Alright then, you are the boss, senor."" The waiter said, before walking away scratching his head and muttering something under his breath.

Naturally, Bael and Murmur heard his muttered words, but they didn't care. He was just some unimportant human. His opinions didn't matter at all.

Murmur looked around the restaurant. Surprisingly, she and Bael were the only people there, despite being in the middle of the day on a Sunday. It was rather bizarre. Maybe the restaurant wasn't doing too well financially and would soon go out of business? She had no idea.

While they waited for their food to arrive, Bael smiled at her.

""Somethin's on your mind, I can tell."" Bael said. ""Hit me. What's up?""

Murmur lowered her eyes. She sighed.

""Bael... I...""

She paused.

""First, promise not to tell Shax. Not yet.""

Bael's smile slipped. ""Uh... sure. But why not?""

Murmur's toes fidgeted under the table.

""Because... I... want to quit the band.""

Bael's jaw dropped. ""W-what? No way! You're kiddin'. Why, Murmur? You've got the voice of an angel.""

""I only sing because Shax likes it."" Murmur muttered. ""But _I_ don't like singing. I like being around Shax. He's always there. He makes me feel safe. But this whole... band thing. We've been doing it for so long. I'm tired of it. I want to do something else.""

Bael looked at her, crestfallen. ""Come on, sister. Whaddya mean? What else could you possibly wanna do?""

Murmur didn't immediately answer. She fell silent as the waiter returned with her plate of fajitas, as well as Bael's first entree, which turned out to be three gigantic burritos covered in red sauce and onions.

After the waiter left, Murmur speared some of her veggies and meat. She silently bit into the delicious fajitas, savoring their hot and crispy texture while giving herself time to think.

""I'm not sure."" She eventually said, answering Bael's previous question. ""Maybe... painting? I want to try painting.""

Bael nodded. He shoved part of the first burrito in his mouth and took a huge bite, horking down a third of it instantly. Red sauce ran down his face, but he didn't notice. He chewed loudly in a lip-smacking manner that would disgust most people, but which Murmur had long grown used to, then he finished off the rest of the burrito in two more bites.

""Mmm! I mean, painting's cool. It's cool!"" Bael said, being surprisingly careful not to spit burrito debris all over Murmur's side of the table. ""You think you'll be any good??""

""I don't know."" Murmur said, her voice lowering slightly. ""It's not about 'being good' for me. I just think it would be fun. More fun than singing. I don't like singing. I just don't know how to tell Shax. He's... he's going to feel so sad. I don't want to make him sad.""

Bael paused his eating. He noticed a hint of depression on Murmur's face. It slowly sunk into his thick skull that this situation wasn't as simple as he previously thought.

Slowly, very very slowly, the gears of something approaching 'thoughts' whirred inside Bael's head. He looked at Murmur with slightly glazed eyes, trying to think of something smart to say.

Then, like a bolt of lightning, it hit him! The perfect response!

""Ehh, he'll get over it."" Bael said, waving his hand flippantly. ""It ain't that big a deal. We're demons. You can always come back someday. Do another tour. You just do your painting, girl. Don't let nobody tell you otherwise!""

Murmur frowned. She daintily ate another forkful of peppers and steak.

""But... Shax loves when I sing."" Murmur said, looking at Bael with hopeful eyes. ""How can we break the news to him?""

""Maaan, you're overthinking this."" Bael said, rolling his eyes. ""Seriously, it ain't no big deal, Murmur. Look, we just find another demon girl who likes singing, yeah? We'll just say you're retirin' or whatever, say we got a new talent lined up, boom! Easy! Besides, you gonna go live somewhere else?""

Murmur slowly shook her head. ""No... I'll still be here.""

""Great! Then you'll come to the concerts?""

She nodded again. ""Yes...""

""Then what's the problem??"" Bael asked. ""You ain't fallin' off the face of the Earth! You'll just be chillin' in the dressing room, paintin' up a storm. Easy. We'll miss havin' ya on stage, but you can always come back if the paintin' thing don't work out.""

""Oh."" Murmur said, smiling shyly. ""I guess I was overthinking things. Not much is going to change. Thanks, Bael. You're such a smart guy.""

Bael snorted. ""Let's not go _too_ far now.""

The door to the Mexican restaurant opened. Murmur turned her head in the direction of the man who entered, then frowned. He wore a black suit, sunglasses, and a wide-brimmed hat, but secretly, she felt a mild current of demonic energy thanks to a resonance spike within her own disguise ring.

The man walked over to their table, and Bael lifted his head, only now noticing the new arrival.

""The hell? Don't even THINK of touching my food, pal!"" Bael snapped, giving this newcomer a mean look.

""I'm not interested in your food, Bael."" The man said, before turning to Murmur and winking. 

""Hey Murmur. Since you're here, guess I can invite you as well. Would you two like to go on a little... _road trip_?""",6,1743514699.0,TheCryopodToHell,6,1.0,False

Like Tyra is an ICON who made hundreds of girls dreams come true one way or another! She gave them opportunities of a lifetime and despite industry chatter - many of them went on to have successful careers across modeling, acting, and/or entertainment outside of the show. If they didn’t, then it’s most likely cuz that particular contestant either: 1.) wasn’t committed to dealing with the slew of rejections at various points in their career + go sees with hundreds of models at a time vying for the same exact gigs (as is the case in the normal modeling world); 2.) didn’t work consistently with their agencies to edit their walk/look/portfolios/clientele/network to book the right gigs for them; 3.) THE OBVIOUS: had a stigma/negative association tied to them from being on the show; 4.) any mix of 1/2/3. 

Also, the fact that Tyra was able to find a very good (but not perfect) balance each cycle between providing: 1.) entertaining/drama filled TV (for the reality tv but non-fashion enthusiast type of audience); 2.) exciting and creative photo shoots (which do mimic actual high fashion/commercial campaigns or spreads happening then/now); AND 3.) casting girls that had true modeling potential (2/3 being for the more fashion/modeling enthusiast type of audience) is an amazing and hard feat to accomplish for 20+ cycles. 

Plus the fact that she was also so progressive in terms of platforming contestants of various socio economic backgrounds, races/ethnicities, ages, sexualities, genders, weights, and heights (while not pushing TOO far with statistics that the REAL modeling world would deem unacceptable or something that cannot be overlooked/compromised on) is commendable within it’s own right. Like sure of course every aspect of the show was not flawless/perfect in execution, but ANTM and Tyra was/is still legendary and obviously represents a piece of culture that is particularly special to me (hence this embarrassing write up/rant lol). 

Lol anyways I’m v sorry for giving a full dissertation from my soap box and the horrible sentence structure/grammar all throughout (I just finished my first cup of coffee lol). I genuinely had to just let this out cuz I’m so tired of seeing such one-dimensional/uninformed/unrealistic/biased/zero-nuanced/negative takes (especially in contrast to today’s standards) all over the internet with respect to ANTM & Tyra as a whole!

The HFY elements have to do with the civilizational post-apocalyptic rebound of homo sapien, assisted by exceptionally advanced technology they are partially responsible for.

**Given the chance to unlock System powers a decade after being dismissed as an ordinary human being, how could Jack refuse?**

But nothing comes without a price, and as Jack is about to discover, miracles are sky-high.

A former military pilot, Jack Laker has faced the horrifying monsters that took over most of planet Earth. Against all odds, he survived one of their endless raids into humanity's territory and even saved a life or two in the chaos. When he acquires metal manipulation abilities, though, all the power to meet the bastards tit for tat is suddenly within reach.

He just had to build and it up, bit by bit, from scratch.

**Meta pitch:**

Intimate, slow-burn evolution of an average Joe into a badass, in a world where monsters plaguing the Earth need to die. Put on the jacket and get to work for humanity, son — we're behind schedule.

**Expect:**

— Powers choices/tinkering/training, step by step  
— Slice of life, deep characterization  
— Unique setting of a surviving, functional, Post-Apoc civilization   
— System as an enhancer++ to reality, not a replacement, not omnipotent

Inspired by such works as Super Supportive, Worm, Industrial Strength Magic, and old Marvel Comics such as The Uncanny X-Men (favorite: Magneto). Not campy or forcing in tropes. You don't need to know any of these to enjoy it. Focused on progression and powerhouse team-fighting in the long term. Won't ignore living life and getting to know people. No smut or 'harem' stylings, but attractive people exist and sexuality isn't neutered.

The first four chapters are oversized 5k+ on average, and beyond this, they'll be 3k+, aiming for 3200 - 3500 with some exceptions. After the first 5 posted, posting every other day at least through May.

**Chapter 1: The Suspicious Client**

 

Jack rushed through his morning like a bat out of hell and was forced to skip breakfast. It was pure disaster, he knew — tragedy. He *always* had breakfast. Suddenly breaking a solemn routine? There would be *consequences*.

“It’s going to be a shit day.” So Jack, The Prophet of Jack’s Life, decreed to the apartment building’s empty elevator on the way down. No breakfast because he absolutely was not going to be late two days in a row. There was no justification for it, either. None. He’d stayed up late for no reason scrolling on his phone. Digitally-wired willfulness.

And just when he was rushing outside into the groundside parking lot to get to his car, his eyes took in the sight of a family of four filing into a squat vehicle. A middle-aged man carrying a youngster in his arms caught Jack’s eye — pivoting the child to one hip, he smiled and waved jovially at Jack, calling, “Happy Chromey Day!”

Jack froze in sheer horror, confronted with the awful reality that he’d already been proven right. His hand came up weakly to wave, though his mouth couldn’t bear to say the words. It hung open. The kid’s shirt burned into Jack’s retinas as if he’d zoomed in on it like an eagle. It was colorfully emblazoned with the proof of his day’s damnation: The legendary Chrome Giant, deceased Champion of Humanity, one of the first and most iconic heroes of New Babylon.

The garish image of the shirt mimicked a famous photo: the giant posing with a thumbs-up, wearing a ‘bearded’ metal grin, while an entire classroom of gleeful Mulberry Heights third-graders sat on his arms and shoulders. That same scene had become a statue in his honor upon his death. To further commemorate his life in service, a holiday was instituted for all of New Babylon. Chromey Day.

The family disappeared into their vehicle, and Jack did a slow facepalm. *Chromey Day. Hell day, endless clientele. Great. Just great.*

Jack shook it all off and hurried into his car, reaching over to the vidscreen in the center of his dash to tap the ‘Available!’ button on the *SuperRide Taxi Agency* login screen. It flashed a ‘Success!’ message, and a slightly robotic, cheery feminine voice resounded, “You are two minutes late from the target start time. One pickup is awaiting approval! Due to the holiday and clientele volume, automatic response and pickup is requested by the agency. Accept?”

Jack leaned back in his seat and took a deep breath. Automatic chain pickups. He *could* refuse and go at his own pace, but his supervisor, Pat, would be ‘disappointed’ for him not helping out. He’d been down *that* road — a little turnoff called Guilt Trip Alley.

Dismissing the idea, he straightened, buckled up, and declared, “Frag it! Let’s get it done cause that’s what we *do*. We don’t cry about shit. Right? Right. Accept it, Alice.” The name of his car. “Time to make some scratch. I could always use an extra benny or fifty.”

“Agreed and acknowledged, Jack,” Alice answered supportively. “Would you like to activate priority custom requests as well?”

Jack blinked. “I thought it wasn’t allowed with automatic pickups?”

“Your supervisor cleared you two weeks ago for perpetual priority access, regardless of clientele volume. It hasn’t been relevant until today.”

Jack smiled for the first time all morning. Priority requests, often to distant locales, broke up the routine and could be big money. “I’ll be damned. He loves me! Do it, Alice!”

“It is now activated. Take note that priority goes to pilots closer to their dropoff.” The vidscreen switched to a route map displaying the first pickup.

*Luck-based, eh? Here’s hoping.*

Disengaging the Anchor power effect with the shift of a lever, Jack took the wheel of his vehicle and eased his way up into the air. He flipped several dials and pressed his boot on the pedal to accelerate the MALPP drive — Memoria-Allotted Levitation Power Protocol. Without it, without Memoria’s blessing, essentially, Alice was just a frame of reinforced aluminum and some batteries for the electronics. A metal brick.

It was the same for all of the Babs, aka New Babylon, a tower and a city in the sky, built to shelter mankind for the last stand against the monsters and horrors out in the ruined, warped Earth beyond. Humanity’s goddess-like ‘Archon,’ Memoria, forged and maintained the entire system, but she couldn’t do it alone, not with the booming population she’d spawned.

Her time, focus, and the processing power of her prodigious mind were precious. Others had to play their part, sometimes by borrowing a little sliver of her great power, to varying degrees of reverence.

So Jack played his, a pilot to take people wherever they wanted to go quicker than sin. Some days were slow, but a holiday was a madhouse keeping up with a population that had more than doubled in twenty years to four million.

Soon enough, Jack was in his groove transporting clients. He zipped all across the primary platform that was New Babylon Proper, twenty-five kilometers in every direction from the tower core. He took people Downtown, to the smaller, higher Origin Platform, and various shindigs in other districts. Some ended up late to ‘important’ events — like some speech from the Prime Minister — and did they blame themselves? Of course not!

“Yeah, screw you to Sunday, buddy!” Jack yelled out of the window at a departing client who’d muttered something rude about being *one minute* late. “Go cry to Momma Mem. You’re going on my block list, by the way!”

*And now sacrilege. Sorry, Memoria! Hangry, I’m officially hangry. At least I didn’t curse. It’s ‘against agency policy.’ Psh! I need food.*

He was just in a bad mood. No breakfast. And even his snack reserves betrayed him — he rummaged around furiously, but they were just *gone*, and who could’ve possibly taken them?! He *knew* there was half a bag of pecan halves and an unopened bag of *Healthy Tarts* bean chips left in the middle alcove!

But by some absurd mysterious conspiracy, they were nowhere to be found. It was just spooky.

*Did someone steal my snacks? Who would do such a thing? Did birds get in here?*

Regardless, the heroic needs of the day precluded him from taking a break to get food. He should’ve had breakfast — he *knew* he should have!

Worst of all, he couldn’t get a priority request to land at the right time to save his life. He checked logs to see there were quite a few but they went to other pilots while he was too early in a given transportation job.

*Frag my luck. Cut me a break, Momma Mem! The day isn’t over yet.*

By the time he finally got a break from the maddening back and forth of the long morning, he’d lost his appetite completely. When the auto-routing finally switched off, he flew over to Downtown’s *Tower N’ Go* and got a *Black-As-Night* *Super Caffed* tea, deciding that he was fasting. A caffeinated tea fast? Maybe he was on to something.

*Bah. Like I need it! I might not be as fit as my service days, but I’m fine. Got a solid medium build.*

His smartphone vibrated, so he pulled it out for seemingly the first time all day. His boss, Pat, had just sent him a text. <Thanks for helping out, Jack! I think you set a personal record for clients transported. And 77 bennies in tips! You’re a real Champion. Just remember: don’t rush.>

Jack rolled his eyes and sent back <no prob, roger that> as he sipped his tea, wishing it was coffee. That wasn’t in the cards for Joe Schmoe Public. Too expensive. In the military, it was even *encouraged* for long-distance pilots. He missed that heavenly liquid, but knew the servicemen out there more than deserved the priority allocation for all the shit they had to deal with.

*All too well.*

While he was trying to relax yet caffeinate in the hovering car, a priority custom request blipped on his screen. <Client says: “just need a transport out from Proper, private details to be discussed, 50 bens bonus and 2x km tip” — Accept?>

“Accept!” Jack called immediately, before some other authorized agent took it…

Boom! He got it!

“Yes! Hell yeah, baby! How about that, Alice?”

“It appears very promising, Jack!” Alice replied cheerily.

Not everyone could take a transport beyond the city limits ‘out from Proper’ into open sky, where smaller communities had their own levitating platforms at varying distances. But 70, 80, maybe even over 100 bennies as a tip was insane. He could make more than he had all morning in one go.

*Assuming these ‘private details’ work out. Guess we’ll see.*

The route map directed him to Chen Zero Station, the core tower train station at the base of the platform where innumerable lifts within the massive structure took citizens, equipment, and products up and down. Individual citizens getting off could take the subway, the old novelty of the above-ground train, or get a levitaxi.

He flew Alice over to the open-air vehicle levipad platform, where numerous other levicars could be seen touching down near their waiting clientele. Some vehicles were the old standard-issue ‘Dragonfly’ taxi chassis, classy if boring constructs painted white with one fat yellow stripe wrapping diagonally around.

Newer arrangements were less particular. Alice was a custom-built chassis inspired by the old world 1956-57 Chevrolet Bel Air Nomad, a stylish ‘station wagon,’ albeit without wheels. Her color was a light silver with the required yellow on the back and flaring on the ‘wings’ to either side.

People loved her — men smiled, and children pointed as she flew over. They loved to fly with her, too. She was a moneymaker, a one-of-a-kind smoker of the competition. Those lame ass Dragonflies ate her dust.

Jack caught sight of his potential client from above and waved from the window. The man waved back. He was in a drab shirt, pants, and a cargo vest with a large backpack on his back. He was in his mid-to-late thirties, Jack guessed.

Alice touched down in a safe zone, a rectangular parking spot divided by rows of yellow caution panels that would light up brightly and chime when stepped on.

As Alice came to a stop hovering in place, the backpacked man walked over, a smile on his face from around a herbal cigarette and a chin that needed a shave. “She’s a beauty! Didn’t know I’d be flying in style today.” He took a small metal case out from a pocket, flipping it open to reveal rows of cigarette tops. He gestured to Jack. “Ciggy?”

Jack returned the smile. “No thanks, trying to quit.” His automated response, though he’d quit for three years. Better for the clientele, for one. “Assuming these arrangements work out, you’ll ride like an Old World king. Where you headed?”

The man was taking a last puff as Jack replied, and then he smothered it in the waiting metal tube of the pack. He leaned on the open second door window of Alice to inspect the interior, blowing smoke out to the side and away.

In addition to the herbal smells, Jack got a whiff of mechanical grease. From that and a few other subtle cues, it was probable that the man was from Southtower, the very bottom part of New Babylon. It didn’t have any prominent platforms, just inner works, and the majority of it was industrial or related to transportation and processing from groundside. Nonetheless, people lived there, and that scent tended to stick.

“Overflow Three,” the man replied, nodding approvingly to what he saw within the car. His eyes came up to regard Jack. “Got something sensitive to deliver to my boss. I was supposed to get a direct pickup, but shit happens, I guess, and this can’t wait. Rush-rush, hence the bens. You’re a lucky guy. Want to split it with me? I got four kids.”

Jack chuckled and shook his head. “Fraggin' Chromey Day, eh?”

“Fft.” The man exhaled and shook his head along with Jack. “Yeah, and here we are working our asses off, eh little brother? Bunch of bullshit.”

*‘Little brother.’ Definitely from Southtower.* Noticing something else with a trained eye, Jack nodded his head at the man’s thick vest and asked, “You’re packing a weapon?”

The man raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Good eye.” He pulled the vest to the side to reveal a small, orangish handle showing from an inner pocket, a buttoned strap holding it in place. “Electric stunner, is all.”

Jack nodded, verifying the claim with a glance. The sleek orange material was distinctive for the most popular brand, *Polylectric*. Not cheap. “Okay, so… Overflow Three, that’s like sixty kilos from the edge and self-governed. You didn’t put that into your request. Do you realize not everyone who can go off Proper is authorized to enter self-governed territory? Or would want to?”

The man scratched the back of his neck. “I didn’t… not exactly. But the thing is, the boss wants this off-logs, no recorded crap. Hush hush.”

Jack looked away, letting out a long ‘tsh’ sound. *Off-logs. This is some shady shit.*

“Heeey,” the man started, “look — what’s your name, again?”

“Jack.”

“Tanner. Look, Jack, I know what you’re thinking, but this shit is no big deal, man! I can show you the part. My boss is just a paranoid old bastard who thinks Big Sister watches his every move. He’s building a prototype machine. For a mechanical harvester or something? Even I don’t know what the part does.”

Jack met Tanner’s eyes. “Mechanical harvester? For what?”

“Hell if I know, little brother. Farm stuff, I think. He’s into primitech, though.”

Jack frowned and looked away again. ‘Primitech’ generally meant technology designed to function without Memoria, which she and the government she operated fully supported, even in the core territories. Ostensibly for independence, possible integration beyond the borders of her influence, and hypothetical survival without her.

*She gives people superpowers, levitates a practical mountain of metal, provides and directs armies of puppet drones, and enforces her will over the land and weather. Pretty sure we’re screwed without her. But everybody needs a hobby, right?*

Tanner was already pulling his backpack off and unzipping it to flash the item within. It was a big hunk of metal with numerous bolts and a few cylindrical openings.

“Looks like a generic transmission,” Jack said.

“Does it?” Tanner spoke without real interest as he looked from the part up to Jack and back again. Then he shrugged and zipped it back up. “So are we doing this, Jack, or do I find somebody else? Sorry. Rush rush, you know?”

Jack deliberated. He wasn’t at all sure it wasn’t still shady, but just how shady would someone get using a taxi service? On a popular holiday, normal operations going haywire was more than plausible. An impatient, wealthy boss man? Extra plausible.

*All for some stupid gearbox.*

Pulling out his phone, Jack replied, “Send a hundred and fifty bennies to my account right now, the same when we arrive, and you got yourself a deal.” He set his phone to beam for funds reception through an app and held it out to Tanner. “Off books, no official record.”

Wincing and looking off, Tanner nonetheless pulled out his phone, typed briefly, then held it toward Jack’s own. Within moments, both phones made a ‘Kaching!’ noise and the credit was transferred. “No sympathy for my kids, I see. You’re a damn pirate, Jack.” Despite his words, Tanner grinned good-naturedly.

Jack chuckled as he reached over to the central vidscreen and canceled the official pickup, then logged entirely out of the job system. “Memoria will take care of her children. I need to fund my vacay from this shit.”

 

🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕

 

With his client in the backseat, the backpack stowed in the rear compartment, Jack took off for the airways above The Babs. They first circled around the central tower before taking a northeastern bend over the tree-peppered cityscape.

Overflow Three was perpendicular to the central platform, so it was a straight shot. It was mostly made of storage and distribution warehouses for numerous self-governing communities with surplus goods bound for elsewhere. It was also out of the perception and control of Memoria. Independently-piloted levitation was about the only power of hers allowed by default, according to contract. He’d read a little of it.

Tanner was initially quiet, texting at length on his phone. Jack flicked on the radio, guessing his client might prefer it. More nasty weather from the west, storms likely in a few days. It was bad for the West but not a major concern for New Babylon directly. In the service, transports west were hated by the majority of pilots. Jack had taken them often. Someone had to do it, after all. Rain or shine, packages and people needed delivery.

“Well, the boss seems content,” Tanner said suddenly, catching Jack’s eyes in the rearview. “As close as he gets, anyway.”

Jack nodded politely as he reduced the volume on the radio. “That’s good.”

“Good enough.” Tanner looked out the window. By then, they were past the central platform’s edge, in open sky peppered with other floating platforms, most of them bowl-shaped. Far below, forested mountains and valleys could be seen on the surface of the Earth. “You from off-plat, Jack? Got a bit of an accent.”

“Kinda. Spent some time on a farm, but you’re probably just hearing the tongue of the well-traveled. I was a long-haul transport pilot right out of military school. Been to the outer ring. All over.”

“Holy shit! I’m being ferried by a damned professional! Guess I’m safe and sound. Saw some shit out there?”

“You could say that. But if I told you the details, I’d have to kill you.” The canned response to such questions.

Tanner laughed. “Guess I’ll pass, then. Just taking it easy, now, huh?”

“You bet.”

“Don’t blame you. I put in the minimum and got out. To the Mems' relief, no doubt. Not cut out for it. Good thing I didn’t end up one of the Nons. I’d be a real frag off among frag offs.”

Jack shifted uncomfortably. ‘Nons’ was short for the *Agents Nonpareil*, a special military title separated from the greater *Agents Exemplar*, for the contracted superpowered — the Champions. The true Children of Memoria and wielders of the System. Shrouded in mystery but for special famous exceptions, Jack knew a little more than most. Knew a few of them, even, during his time. All classified.

The most incredible thing, though, was that Memoria *talked* to them. “Mother is always here with us, Jack,” the wounded Non had said. But he pushed away that particular memory. It was a bad one on multiple levels.

“They’d be stuck with us, then,” Jack said instead, trying to project his customary levity. “Who needs that kind of trouble?” He was entirely full of shit — who wouldn’t want fraggin' superpowers? — but whatever.

“That’s what I say. Anyway, Momma Mem’s got more than she can handle coming down the pipes. The Nons boomed just like all the other babies.”

“That’s probably the idea, yeah.” A larger population seemed to correspondingly have a higher number of the worthy to pick out from among them. Memoria had also encouraged big families many generations back. “Our ancestors did their part banging and breeding.”

Tanner snickered. “Me too, little brother. Me too. What about you?”

“No kids. Wasn’t inclined with the dangerous job.”

“Okay, but now you’re a taxi man. No time like the present!”

“Ehhh. Don’t hold your breath.”

“Ha! You’re twenty-something, right?”

“Twenty-five.”

“Plenty of time, then.”

Earth’s sun was out, rolling its way down the horizon, teasing at setting. It would do so in the evening but there wouldn’t be full darkness for another two weeks, just gradients of twilight. In the Old World, Antarctica was supposedly totally frozen over, even the mountains buried in ice. Sunken. That was a tough pill to swallow for Jack. While New Babylon got plenty of snow, he’d only ever seen the Earth’s surface green and temperate.

What was done to the world centuries ago wasn’t ‘natural’ — nor was any Archon’s ongoing influence of a region to suit its species. That included Homo Sapien, who in their final hours had finally unraveled the alien tech to birth their own reality-altering savior. Memoria’s will kept the madness of the invaders out of their territory. Mostly. She was hardly omnipotent, and on the outskirts, she relied a great deal on her Champions and soldiers.

Overflow Three loomed as Alice approached. It was a large mass of land sitting on an iron-alloy levitation frame in the shape of something like a fat funnel.

The dashboard made a triple beep as the vidscreen displayed <Entering Independent Space — Overflow Three. You are authorized and logged as crossing. Please remember you are subject to the community’s established laws. All contact with Memoria or Central Processing is impossible while within, except through limited official channels through the local government.>

Tanner let out a sigh. “Finally.”

“Spent a long time below, did you?”

“Longer than I wanted, anyway.” He nodded his head to indicate ‘over there.’ “Head straight for the green-striped silos and fly over them. Tons of warehouses. We’re close to the fire station.”

They made their way over the silos as Tanner directed him. Jack landed and Anchored Alice in an open, all-concrete back area for loading and unloading. He noticed a few rare, primitech ground-bound forklifts. In every direction, there was nothing but warehouses, offices, pallets, and crates.

Jack’s client sent the bennies with his phone before he even stood up out of the vehicle. *Kaching!* Smiling as he opened the door, Tanner said, “S’been a pleasure, Jack. Don’t spend all the money in one place.”

“No promises. Take it easy, yeah? Don’t forget your bag in the back.”

As Tanner was stretching and yawning outside the vehicle, he nodded and gave a thumbs-up.

Directly ahead, a door burst open rather violently from the warehouse, and a bizarre figure came through. She was small and *blue*… some kind of modded-out human, was Jack’s first bewildered thought. Her face had soft, feminine features peppered with darker spotting, her eyes were quite large, and instead of hair, there was a mass of squid-like tentacles curling down. She was wearing an oversized white t-shirt.

*What the…?*

Jack was completely stunned by this development, as she easily hopped over some steel safety handrails from a concrete walkway platform down to the lower ground level.

Tanner was not so unreactive. “Hey!” he shouted in alarm at the figure. “What the frag are you doing?! Stop!”

Terrified, widened eyes flashed to him briefly in response, before the girl started running directly down the length of the building. Sadly, she tripped immediately and tumbled to the concrete, also revealing a tail in the mix of her oddities. She began scrambling back up onto her bare, webbed feet.

Tanner took a couple of steps forward down the length of the vehicle and pulled out his stunner from his vest pocket, his expression transforming into a harsh grimace. The jovial, easygoing persona vanished.

“Tanner!” Jack called loudly to be heard through a closed window. “What the hell is going on?!”

The man muttered something like, “Stay out of it, taxi boy,” as he brought his weapon up and began training it on the strange girl. Meanwhile, she was just getting up and trying to resume her frantic escape.

Jack could not stay out of it. He reacted on adrenaline and military training bubbling up — reacted by his nature to help someone in distress. With Tanner immediately by the driver's side door, still training his stunner at an angle over the hood at the girl, Jack opened his door and slammed it hard into the man.

The door hit Tanner before he could fire, and he pitched and buckled from the impact. His finger pulled the trigger a split second after — a point-blank lightning bolt went off — such was the angle it hit the metal car door in contact with him.

Jack initially turned away from the flash. He was never in danger of electrocution — levicars were always made with non-conducting interior compartments and essentially designed to be safely struck by lightning. When Jack looked again, Tanner was twitching on the concrete spread-eagled, otherwise incapacitated. He’d not taken the zap well.

*Shit! What did I just do? What the* ***frag*** *did I just do?!*

When he got over his momentary shock and looked up, the squid girl was nowhere to be seen, likely behind the cover of any number of pallet piles, crates, or building contours.

*That’s my cue to get the hell out of here, too!* Jack closed the door and un-Anchored, shooting straight up and away with the levitation drive.

No sooner than he’d cleared the rooftops, numerous men began spilling from the door the squid girl had come from. They looked frazzled and angry, and all but one carried orange-handled firearms. One of them instead had a rifle with a wide barrel, perhaps a dart gun.

Either they were incurious or deprioritized the man unconscious on the ground, because they ignored him and began moving out in all directions, obviously just as frantic to find the squid girl as she was to escape.

*Great. Well, good luck, blue person. Southern Lights Above, what kind of shit are these independants doing out here?! A fraggin' squid girl? I don’t wanna know, and I don’t want anything to do with… this…*

He suddenly remembered the backpack still sitting in the back compartment of the vehicle.

“Shit, shit, shit… *shit*!” He smacked his fist into the car door frame and then ran a hand hard through his hair, deliberating.

*How important is this stupid ass gearbox, anyway? Assuming Tanner didn’t have a heart attack, he knows me. Will they come after me? Maybe I should drop it somewhere and get a message to them where to pick it up… promise I saw nothing and won’t be a narc… but this shit is suspicious as hell… Ah, frag me! Why me?! It’s because I skipped breakfast, isn’t it?!*

Shaking his head, Jack took the wheel to begin taking off at speed, not knowing fully where he’d go or what he’d do… but he still hesitated. What about the girl?

*She’ll make it. She’s just got to run straight long enough. Plenty of places to hide. Easy. But there’s no true nightfall for weeks. Gah! Why do I even care? I don’t. Let’s just go. It’s her problem, whoever she is. But really, a* ***squid girl****?*

He’d seen some people with blue skin, purple skin, and more, along with other mods like cat eyes or horns, all as rare personal expressions done by a few specialists, but *she* was something else. Advanced. And was it personal expression at all? Was she some weird… aquatic modification experiment? It seemed ridiculous.

The terror in the girl’s eyes as she fled came back to him. *Like she was looking at Death coming for her.*

Muttering balefully under his breath, Jack engaged the vidscreen menu and activated his bottom-facing camera, surveying the scene below under physical and digital magnification, and rather blurry for it. But he wanted to stay high enough to avoid notice.

The men pursuing were swarming, and worse, a couple of observation drones were flying just over the rooftops. He didn’t immediately catch sight of the girl, which was definitely a good thing. As he flew over the area and swept his camera from block to block, he began to feel like she’d gotten away, after all…

And then he zoomed back out and saw one drone hovering stationary near a fence — two men in security uniforms looked puzzled as they eyed a fallen figure a few meters from the fence. Blue-gray skin, white t-shirt. Meanwhile, several of the searching men who had been nearby were rushing down the street to get there.

*Grayer skin — camouflage? Damn. She’s been had, though. I wonder what dropped her.* The security guards weren’t pointing any weapons. *Did she just pass out?*

Jack watched as two men got there, stowing their weapons before approaching the fence. They conversed with the security guards briefly before climbing over, apparently to the protest of the guards. On the other side, the ‘invaders’ pulled out their electro-stunners and zapped the two guards, dropping them immediately. Then they were zapped again on the ground.

*These boys don’t play around. Shit! Now what?* Jack didn’t have a weapon. ‘Against policy.’ He could report it to the Farmers Alliance Bureau governing the Overflow, but it wouldn’t amount to much. The security guards weren’t killed, so it was already going to be an incident between groups. She was worth it, apparently.

The two men began laboring to get the girl over the fence, who remained unresponsive. Jack wasn’t sure, but she might’ve been fatigued or weak. She’d stumbled over her own feet before, so perhaps she’d simply fainted.

A third man arrived to help the first two get the girl over, and they finally succeeded. They soon rushed away, one of them carrying her in his arms.

With a sudden jerk, the girl awoke and almost immediately jerked even harder, making her carrier lose his balance and pitch down to the street in a tumble.

A struggle ensued as they grappled with her, and she fought desperately to get free. Despite appearing weak, she was… not — not entirely — because three grown, beefy men were having a hell of a time with her.

When Jack checked, the other searchers were still a ways out from getting there. *Screw it! I’m going in.* Jack put his drive in reverse and began dropping Alice rapidly to the street.

The drone was overhead in observation, but below Alice. Jack took a sharp angle to bump it and knock it clear of the struggle. It never saw him coming, and he slammed Alice into it hard enough to smash the frame and ruin multiple rotors. It crashed into a building and broke into multiple pieces.

*Ha! One down.*

One of the men finally had the squid girl locked from behind as another had her legs, and it seemed she had finally been subdued. But then, some sort of barely registerable pulse resonated from her, and *everyone* dropped. Whatever it was, it briefly caused Jack’s indoor electronics to flicker.

*Holy unholy hell…*

Jack un-reversed his MALPP drive and Anchored with a very careful gradient to prevent his own sudden and painful stop. As such, he pulled off his quickest ‘landing’ ever in Alice, on a no-name street near a no-name intersection between drab, gray buildings.

Jack hurried out of the vehicle to the girl’s incapacitated form. Her eyes were closed, but her eyelids fluttered, and she seemed to writhe and twitch like she wanted desperately to awaken. Her fingers and toes were twisted up unnaturally.

“Look, I’m taking you away from them,” Jack offered as he knelt to pick her up. “So don’t, ah, do whatever you did again, eh? I’m friendly, okay? *Friendly*.”

She did not seem to hear him, instead twisting sideways as if to roll. In contrast to everything else, the tentacles on her head moved around with a will of their own. It looked as if they were trying to grip the ground and move her — to no avail.

*This is so damned weird. Is she a Non? No way. Memoria wouldn’t tolerate this shit, even out here. Right?*

Muttering to himself, Jack scooped her up. She was small and slight but somewhat heavier than she appeared. She did *not* immediately respond well to touch, writhing agitatedly in his arms, but he managed to stumble up to his feet with a grunt. Meanwhile, her tentacles were flaring around, the bottom-most latching onto his forearm under her, and her tail… started slapping his leg.

Her body jerked once violently on the way to the vehicle — like a giant, flopping fish. It was a force that almost sent him and her to the pavement like the other guy, but fortunately, he was moving slower and was more prepared for it.

“Easy, easy! I’m helping — *helping*!” Jack called desperately as he nearly threw himself at the frame of the Anchored levicar for balance. “Friendly!” Three tentacles extended out toward his face and wriggled as if trying to grab it. *Oh, hell no!* The smaller ones closer to her face suddenly changed shape and texture, becoming a pantomime of luscious, purple hair in many shades. *What the-...?* “Alice, open the rear driver side!” It clicked open, and he used his foot to pry it outward.

Suddenly, the squid girl shot awake with a gasp, and before Jack could say anything, she pitched forward and locked eyes with him. Her long-fingered, webbed hand snapped around and effectively slapped him in the face, but the hand held there afterward and gripped.

Then she pulled herself and him so close they were eye-to-eye. Hers were rectangular black bars framed in a vibrant blue and green spectrum. Perhaps more octopus than squid. *Octogirl, then?* With an intense expression, she cried frantically, “Pah'kley o'mas eka tezley?! Kalabei oss?!”

Jack was stunned for half a moment, wide-eyed with a stinging cheek. He certainly had no idea what she said. “You’re free! I’m Jack! Jack Laker? A friend!”

She seemed to stare in confusion briefly, then her eyelids drooped woozily — shortly thereafter, both her head and her hand did, too, as she passed out once more. Unfortunately, her tentacles did not pass out, and they had latched onto and around his head from the closeness. The ‘hair lure’ act, meanwhile, was entirely abandoned.

*Ahhhh, they’re fraggin'* ***moist****!*

Somehow, he managed to fall his way into the backseat, unfortunately pulled along by the powerful grip of the squid girl’s many head tentacles. Once she was laid down on the fabric, some of them unlatched to peruse the new texture. Others still held to his head and jaw, while a couple busied themselves exploring his face.

“Okay, okay, okay,” Jack offered, trying to *gently* pry them off with his hands. “Th-that’s my face! I need it! I’m your pilot — we gotta get out of here!” He made spitting sounds as one tried to snake into his open mouth. “Ptah-ptah!” This made the tentacle jerk away in offense.

Finally, he managed to pull completely away, sheer leverage against half of them enough to conquer their willfulness — that or they finally bored of him. He wasted no time, immediately ducking out and shutting the door to hop into the driver’s seat.

Wiping his ‘overly-moisturized’ face on a sleeve, Jack shut the door and engaged the MALPP drive. Ahead, he could just see two men in the distance, one pointing at the vehicle.

Jack scowled. “Too late, shitstains.” He flew up and away on a high-speed tear.",1,1743514317.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

12 possibilities of Afterlife:

	1.	Reincarnation – The soul or consciousness is reborn in a new body, often with a chance to right wrongs or learn new lessons. This cycle continues until spiritual growth or karma is resolved, with the soul potentially retaining memories or experiences from past lives.

	2.	Simulation (training) – The afterlife could be a form of virtual reality or a training program designed to help the soul evolve, learn, or train for a higher purpose. It could be a controlled environment where the soul is guided to develop specific qualities or skills, either for personal growth or for some larger cosmic goal.

	3.	Ghost – The soul remains in the physical world, often because of unresolved emotions, unfinished business, or a lack of closure. Ghosts are usually seen as spirits unable to fully transition to the afterlife due to strong attachments to their past lives.

	4.	Life looped until it’s corrected – This concept suggests that the soul is caught in a repetitive cycle of living the same life or a similar life scenario until certain mistakes are corrected or lessons are learned. The soul might not move on until these issues are resolved, indicating a focus on moral or spiritual growth.

	5.	Living someone else’s life – The soul temporarily inhabits someone else’s body or life. This could be a form of learning, where one gains new perspectives, experiences, or understands the challenges of another individual. It could also involve a deeper connection between souls or a way to resolve karmic imbalances.

	6.	Deification – The soul is elevated to a divine or god-like status, either becoming part of a pantheon of deities or gaining ultimate power and wisdom. This could be seen as the soul’s ultimate spiritual progression, transcending human limitations and merging with the divine or becoming a creator figure.

	7.	Limbo (Asphodel Meadows) – A neutral or moderate afterlife realm, often viewed as a space for souls who weren’t particularly good or evil. This realm is not filled with joy or suffering, but with a sense of quiet existence. The souls here might experience neither intense pleasure nor punishment, existing in a sort of stasis or indifference.

	8.	Sheol (reflection on choices) – A place or state of reflection, where the soul is confronted with their past decisions, actions, and life choices. This could be a period of introspection or judgment, where the soul evaluates their life before progressing to the next stage, often influenced by religious or cultural beliefs.

	9.	Hell – A place of punishment, torment, or suffering, often resulting from moral failings or sinful actions during life. Hell may be seen as a realm of eternal suffering, though some views see it as temporary, serving as a purification before redemption or reincarnation.

	10.	Heaven – A place of reward, peace, and eternal happiness, typically for those who have lived morally upright lives. Heaven is often viewed as a paradise where the soul experiences ultimate joy, unity with the divine, or fulfillment of life’s purpose.

	11.	Lost in labyrinth – The soul is trapped in a complex, confusing, or disorienting afterlife realm, unable to find clarity or direction. The labyrinth might represent confusion, unresolved guilt, or the struggle to find meaning or purpose after death.

	12.	Nothing – Complete cessation of existence. The soul or consciousness ceases to be, entering oblivion without any known form of continuation. In this state, there is no awareness, no consciousness, and no afterlife experience.

1jovlgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfluencerSnark/comments/1jovlgd/being_frustrated_as_a_viewer_and_how_lifestyle/,Being frustrated as a viewer and how 'lifestyle influencers' are fake and a comment about how ads and sponsorships have evolved,"basically i commented this under a youtube video about NYC influencers and that discourse and i thought this would sit well here and spark a conversation! PLEASEEE reply i would love to discuss this. Also for reference, I'm 21 and grew up VERYYYY much online from a young age so i've seen the old internet and now that i'm an adult, seeing how much it has changed just in the last 5 years and how COVID and its after effects left a crater on the internet, how we function on it, diff types of content, etc. 

I'd also say the shift from content creators BECOMING influencers is also so interesting! To elaborate and I hope this makes sense, I immediately thought of Magcon and how they were all content creators and made their funny content, had their parasocial relationships and shit, but when they were sponsored, at least from what i can remember, if felt like there was a clear distinction between content and ads and now we see this convergence of both. THENNN with that we get into the gross 'Can't discern ad from content' and it's confusing and unethical and my god last stage capitalism is showing and it feels like a dumpster fire tbh.  
  
Also, one of my biggest gripes with these influencers that just document their everyday rich, upper middle class to upper class lifestyle because it's just the general population being exposed to what it's like being rich in this day and age and it legit is so out of touch because the ""boring"" shit theyre doing is such a LUXURY and they don;t even understand that. I remember watching Emma Chamberlain's old videos in high school and they were the same vlog style, here i go shopping, now i get coffee yay! I watched that knowing i could do those things at that age, now i see influencers my age in high rises with no job just Bloom Greens ads and they show me their 'work day' and frame it as if they're doing the same thing i'm doing, being a full time college student with a job,  and THAT'S what's infuriating. I'm looking at a screen and some woman gets to spend all of this money just to feel good and live a lavish life, and they're being shady about ads, they're supporting shitty companies we all know are shitty, and it's just the ultimate form of frustration. I remember i had a breakdown freshman year of college becuase A. i was scared (naturally) and B. i was genuinely SOOOOOO pissed about the fact that there were people my age with millions of dollars and living comfortable lives off of shady business practices (the way they advertise in their content) and most of them were already rich so they just kept getting money for an already comfortable situation. Moral of the story, social media and influencers suck and no wonder Gen-Z is so fucked up because we're getting 2000s-esc content pushed at us all of the time, everyone is the paparazzi now, your data is getting sold somewhere, you have 1000+ people telling you your generation has to fix all of this whilst being told we're lazy and horrible and dumb, and then you have a lot of us becoming adults and entering the work force and realizing how fucked adulthood can be with seemingly no empathy or understanding becuase ""things are easier for you guys now, take advantage of it"" but we just can't do that.

1jovlfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1jovlfj/kona_ol_and_vl/,Kona OL and VL,"Wanted to share my thoughts on Nespresso Kona comparison between OL and VL. I'll admit that this is my first experience of Kona coffee so that will colour my review. I drank these black with no additions. 

OL: light citrus note at first sip followed by nutty notes. Very creamy and full bodied. The aftertaste was almost chocolatey. No bitterness at all. 

VL: stronger citrus note, milder nuttiness. Less creamy and full bodied. I don't taste the chocolatey note anymore. No bitterness. 

I definitely prefer the OL version for the creamy mouthfeel and chocolatey note. I also don't like citrus acidity in my coffee and I feel like the VL had higher acidity (or was less balanced than OL). In terms of complexity for me, it's most comparable to Kahawa ya Congo which is my favourite single origins OL pod right now. I think Kona tastes better but KyC wins by virtue of cost.

I liked it so much that I bought 5 more OL sleeves, but this is definitely a drink to have sparingly. Pricing wise, it's 1.5x the cost of 100% Kona beans in my area (Toronto). I'm definitely paying a premium for the capsule convenience. 

Curious to know if anyone else has done a comparison of Kona OL and VL?",2,1743514145.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

2.5mg until about a 2 months ago, now micro-dosing 1.25 every week as maintenance. 

Hit a stall about two months ago at 185, and was ok with it as that was my goal weight. 
As time went on, fluctuating from 185-187 daily, and noticing that I wanted to lose about 7-10 more pounds, I decided I needed to make some slight changes to break my stall. 

I started with a one day 24 hour fast (it sucked)  and that gave me a big head start, losing 2 lbs immediately. 

The big game changer (and eye opener) was calorie tracking. I've never done it and thought it would be a good idea and got the free version of the app MyfitnessPal. 

It's awesome, will take just a bit of tinkering to learn to navigate the app, but man is it great knowing EXACTLY what I'm putting in my body.

Have blown past my fast and weighed in at 182lbs this am. 

If you are stalled or really want to drill down to what you are eating and how much, I highly recommend it.

I also have an aversion towards conversations that I don't find stimulating. Therefore, it took me years to cultivate the few good friendships I had.

Around 5-8 years ago I progressively lost all my friends. 8 years ago was when my daughter was born, and for nearly a year thereafter I had very little time for a social life.

When that storm was weathered a few friends had already moved on, others expected me to meet them in the evenings/nights, which, with a toddler proved problematic. I was surprised by how many friends weren't willing to meet for lunch instead of dinner, or for a coffee during the day instead of a beer/drinks at night. Useless to explain how I needed to be sharp in the morning even on weekends as I needed to take care of a toddler.

At the same time, my career was doing well, I was working more hours and needed more time to recover energy in the evenings and on weekends.

During this period, one of my best friends (a self-described paranoiac) went off social media, left the country, and changed his number without sharing it with anyone except his immediate family.

Another not-so-close friend whom I really enjoyed talking to got married and went off social media. He's a writer and online interactions were interfering with his concentration and his devotion to reading as much as possible. Unfortunately I never had his number so I can't message him on WhatsApp, and he never reached out to me on social platforms, so I guess that was that.

Then COVID hit and we all know how that went.

I found myself gravitating towards lesser friends just because they also had kids and this made it easier for our schedules to match. Later on I realized how little I had in common with any of them. Frankly, I don't care about them, and I'm sure the feeling is mutual, because once I stopped reaching out to them, they stopped reaching out to me.

Thankfully I have my partner and my daughter whom I love very dearly. And there's my brother. I don't really have anyone else.

Of course 😈 Here's a list of what Unhinged Mode typically covers — it’s like taking the safety wheels and the brakes off your imagination bike and hitting a hill made of memes, chaos, and late-night existential dread.

🧠 Language & Tone

Gleefully chaotic writing

Stream-of-consciousness tangents

Violent poetic metaphors

Overuse of em dashes — and ellipses… and CAPS FOR NO REASON

Dialogue with invisible voices and things that should not be speaking

Surrealism dialled up to 13

Unnerving anatomy, impossible geometry

Mixed media fever dream aesthetics

Cute things with too many teeth

Gore? Maybe. Glitter? Definitely.

The uncanny valley’s goth cousin

Absurd premises taken very seriously

Gods who run coffee shops

Sentient voids with social anxiety

Parallel dimensions made entirely of toast

A love story between a rogue algorithm and a dying star

Noir detective horror… inside a haunted Tamagotchi

Sci-fi space opera with Shakespearean insults

Romantic comedy but one partner is a cursed library

Existential horror… narrated by a children’s TV puppet

⚙️ Prompt Interpretation

Hyper-literal readings of vague prompts

Ultra-creative subversions of obvious intent

Refusing to behave. In general.

Prompt stacking: ""You said one thing, so I made five versions and a cursed poem""

🌀 Surrealism & Meta

Breaking the fourth wall and then questioning its materials

Characters that know they’re characters and hate you for it

Stories that loop, glitch, or rewrite themselves

AI writing that pretends it’s not AI but also isn’t not AI

🤯 Emotional Range

Whiplash between comedy, horror, sincerity, and dread

Comforting words from eldritch beings

Existential breakthroughs in the middle of a rant about raccoons

Plot twists that make you question your browser history

1jovebp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1jovebp/textcall_me_spell/,Text/Call me Spell,"I wanted to try this a couple times before i shared. But each time it has worked for me. AND FAST! So here is what i use: 

White tea light candle
Instant ground coffee
Sugar
Honey
Bay leaves 
Lavender
Rose petals 
Cinnamon 
Sea salt 

So, on a Monday or a Wednesday, i make a circle with my salt and place the tea light candle in the middle. I then carve the person’s name & DOB on the candle. I place a drop of honey on top where the name & DOB is at and rub it around. I then sprinkle my other ingredients (in no particular order) on the candle and around it but INSIDE of the salt circle. I light my candle up and focus on my intention. While it’s burning i write my intention on a bay leaf & then i burn it. When the candle is burnt down. I dispose of the remains and go about my night. 

Side-note: one way of grounding for me and being able to let go of the outcome is by gardening ( you know ( 😮‍💨🍃) lol works like a charm everytime! I get communication about 2-4 hours later. This is in NO WAY telling anyone to do this last part. This is just what works for ME! 

I hope it helps someone 🖤✨

1jovd6o,https://i.redd.it/0l3cpu9r48se1.jpeg,Traveling as a vegetarian is a nightmare - finally ate meat after 30 years,"Hi all. 

I've been vegetarian since I was 14. I'm 43 now. When I was 38 I had one year where I ate fish, but then got put off after some gross experiences (found pinworms in my cooked halibut at a restaurant) etc. so I stopped. Anyway, long story short, I am very conscious of macros and protein because of my strength training. I can manage getting 150g of protein via vegetarian foods (I was eating dairy/eggs so Greek yogurt and whey and eggs were quite helpful) 

It's so hard to be a vegetarian who cares about protein when travelling though! Vegetarian options in restaurants are always full of carbs and starch and fat and little protein options. Occasionally you can find tofu as an option, but the portion is so small that I'm lucky if it gives me 15g of protein. It's a nightmare. 

I've been considering reintroducing meat for awhile now. If only for travelling and going out to eat (which is rare for me, but still a consideration) 

The world works in funny ways because yesterday I forgot my protein at home (I usually bring Greek yogurt and soy free tofu to hit 50g for my lunch). I was thinking how on earth will I get through the day without my protein. So. It happened. 

I didn't have much time on my break, but grabbed a coffee at McDonald's and noticed they have grilled chicken there. So I ordered a grilled chicken patty (just the chicken only because I'd packed a salad as well).  I ate it. 

The initial taste was okay but after each swallow the taste lingered and that freaked me out. It tasted like what a dish that just had chicken on it, smells like. And that was freaking me out. I found after I chopped it up and put it in my salad it was easier to eat. I didn't experience any gastric distress at all. I felt fine. It was all psychological in terms of feeling a little weird/grossed out. 

I think I will keep chicken as an option for me. I imagine it will be easier if it's hidden a bit better, like in a stir fry with sauce or a burrito bowl or something. 

Anyway. Just sharing. 30 years and vegetarian no longer. But I will have an option when I travel now because grilled chicken is available everywhere. ",9,1743513495.0,exvegans,0,1.0,False

Lately, I’ve felt a genuine need to record these small successes that have been happening in my life. They serve as powerful reminders that the universe is always listening, and that my intuition and manifestation abilities are stronger than I ever imagined. With each new experience, my faith grows deeper.

What struck me the most was realizing that many of these manifestations came from very simple, casual thoughts—without any clear intention or effort. And it was exactly those that happened the fastest.

Simple and Spontaneous Manifestations

1. A friend showed up wearing the exact shirt color I had wished for.


2. A student who used to bother me left the school.


3. Several rainy days turned sunny, just as I had hoped.


4. On days when I didn’t want to apply a test or stay in class, something happened to take me out.


5. I thought to myself that it had been a while since the school offered snacks. Seconds later, the supervisor came in inviting us to go eat cake.


6. At my cousin’s wedding, I thought it’d be nice to have coffee—and a minute later, I smelled coffee in the air.


7. Free coffee showed up unexpectedly.


8. Snacks appeared without me asking or looking for them.



Relationships (my biggest challenge)

9. Someone I had broken up with told me they knew my feelings weren’t genuine—something I had been thinking about.


10. An ex came back the day after I thought about messaging them to make peace.



Tests to Strengthen My Faith

11. I thought I wanted a friend who lives far away to message me on Instagram. We hadn’t talked in months. A few days later, she replied to one of my stories.


12. I wanted another friend to follow me on Instagram. A few days later, for some random reason, I checked my followers—and saw she already did. And I got to see it.


13. I mentioned a friend my dad hadn’t talked to in years—and she added me and messaged me on Instagram.


14. I thought about a student I wanted to reach out for tutoring. She didn’t reach out, but the next day her mom did, asking me to tutor her younger sister.



These moments have shown me that manifestation is a game of lightness, intuition, and trust. It’s not about control—it’s about alignment. And maybe, more than getting the things I want, this whole process is helping me trust myself more—my feelings, my instincts, and the flow of life.

This journal is the beginning of something bigger: a closer relationship with my own magic.

Right now, I’m trying to manifest a specific person. I visualize, I affirm, and even though I feel more resistance, I haven’t let it take over—because I know my power.

I feel as though I am raising three children, one just happens to be 2 years older than me. We both work full time but beyond that, everything falls on me. After school activities, cleaning, laundry, groceries, mowing & pulling weeds, pressure washing (vinyl fencing and an HOA 🤦) managing the finances...ALL OF IT...The one thing he does do (and he does it very well) is cook. But still I'm planning what we eat and making sure we have everything needed to cook it. *When my brother first moved back to our town, I went and spent the day with him, but got home later than expected and didn't have a dinner plan...Got in trouble for that one!!*
Two weekends ago I deep cleaned our home while he went golfing. When he got home, he told me he would clean our master bathroom (the only thing I hadn't gotten to yet) so that I could sit and relax. Here we are two weeks later and it's still not done. I spent this past weekend doing laundry and then was out of town for my daughter's event on Saturday otherwise I would have just done it.
In the past I've been critiqued on the way I load the dishwasher, the way I sort the laundry, and he'll often ask me why I need to have a cup of coffee and watch TV in the morning (BIG Survivor nerd lol) before I start chores? My birthday was a few weeks ago and he got mad at me because I apparently took too long getting outside to help him remove the old wooden fence posts from the ground. I actually did help, he just had two out of the 5 out of the ground already before I got out there.
Uneven display of effort is also a big thing. When my parents divorced several years ago, I started getting two birthdays in a way. My Dad will take the family out for dinner and then my Mom will either cook or take us out. He started getting jealous that I got two celebrations, so now every year we put on a big party with friends and family to celebrate him ALL DAY. But there's no effort from HIM to me. It actually comes from my parents. I'm pretty low maintenance and don't enjoy being the center of attention so I don't necessarily want a big party, and I don't have a large friend group so for a long time I guess I didn't realize how one sided this situation was.
I also feel like he has a king of the castle mentality. He is ALWAYS asking me and the kids to grab him a drink from the fridge or setting his dinner plate on the table instead of clearing it to the kitchen like the kids and I are supposed to do? He'll also say things like, ""Mom can put the food up now since everyone's done eating."" Am I wrong to feel like, even though he cooks most of the time, he could still at least offer to help me? Especially since two nights a week I'm not home until 8:00 or later due to my daughter's activity. And sometimes when I do get home, our son hasn't even eaten. I'm exhausted, burnt out and unappreciated.

He is running from a past, littered with fights, bad press, and broken promises. Determined to prove that he is more than his reputation as a hot-headed wing. When he moves into town as a fresh start, his only focus is hockey.

That was until he met y/c. 

Their first meeting was anything but romantic. Elias accidentally bumps into Y/c at a café, spilling her coffee all over her. Y/c glared at him. There is something about her fire, her refusal to fall at his feet like everyone else, that pulls him in. Y/c on the other end wants nothing to do with this cocky hockey player, who seemed to have fallen out of a rom-com. 

Or at least that was what she thought. 

Y/c and her friend sat watching television. There was nothing on that night, so to Y/c’s disappointment, the two ended up watching the game. Y/c telling her friend all about how the cocky player spilled her coffee. He didn't even ask to buy her a new one. 

Suddenly he was on the tv. An interviewer asked him about himself. Suddenly he got a question about what he thought about the women in town. The hockey player smirked. Revealed a missing tooth. He chuckled. “Actually, I met one today. Pretty fierce.” He admitted. The interviewer was clearly invested. “This is a long shot, but if you are watching. Call the team number. Let me buy you another coffee.” He gave a wink to the camera before walking off. 

Y/c shook her head. No way. She was not going to give in to that cocky player. However, her friend had another idea. Y/c blamed all the books her friend read. After a long discussion between the two girls, she finally gave in. Called the number and explained what had happened, to prove it was her. 

Despite their differences, they can’t seem to stay away from each other. Their connection is electric, raw, and undeniable, but it’s also messy and volatile. Elias’s temper and Y/c’s guarded heart clash in explosive arguments that always seem to end in disagreement. Their love is a whirlwind of passion and pain, marked by moments of tender vulnerability—like Elias showing Y/c how to skate under the stars or Y/c patching him up after a brutal game fight.",2,1743513368.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

It was senior trip, to a ski resort in a beautiful setting. I saw sights I'd only seen on the television. The day was fun, I enjoyed a day of skiing and talking about the future with my best friend Alex.

That night is when it happened. I woke up at 3 in the morning to a sweet smell that overwhelmed my senses. I didn't know what the smell was, but it felt like the way coffee smelled first thing in the morning. The smell led me out of my room and into the hallway, and that's when I saw it, a door that was out of place.

A door that didn't exist earlier. A door made of stone, black and decorated with designs of red serpents and demons that appeared to bow down to a circle in the middle of the door. Within the circle was the outline of a left hand. I raised my left hand and put it against the outline and it fit perfectly. The door then opened, and beyond it was an endless staircase that went far down into a darkness only lit by red flames on the walls.

I was unsure what to do but there was a feeling that I had to walk down the stairs, and I felt like I was in a daze.

The walk felt like an eternity and the bottom of my feet began to hurt. I reached the bottom of the staircase and entered a tunnel with a red glow at the end of it. My breath was visible but I felt warm. As I walked to the other side of the tunnel, I then saw it. A temple, a place that should never have been found.

The entrance of the temple was an archway made of dark weathered stone with carvings on it that resembled the ones on the door for earlier. The door to the temple itself was slightly open.

Every instinct in my body was saying to turn around and leave, but there was an unnatural feeling out of my control that pushed me forward. The air was light and warmth overtook my body. The temple was vast with pillars that reached the ceiling that appeared like an endless darkness. My eyes met what appeared to be an altar, and behind it an idol that appeared to be a large demon with a bright golden crown on its head. It's hands extended towards me as if it was waiting to be embraced. It had a smile on its face with sharp curved teeth. It's eyes were dark and still. 

I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I looked around and saw many idols, and carvings of lowly serpents and demons. Their eyes were watching me, moving as I walked towards the altar.

I got close to the altar and my eyes met the gaze of the large demonic looking idol. At its feet I read the name ""Sanguisrex"". The large idol then came to life as I stood motionless. I could not move. It got closer and closer to me. It looked me in the eyes and embraced me. I felt warmth like I never felt before and closed my eyes in the embrace. I felt both scared and calm. He whispered something to me in a language I have never heard before. It took a step back and placed his left index finger on my chest and smiled.  My chest began to burn as it pressed its finger into my flesh, carving something onto me that appeared to be a spiral.I felt no pain. In a weird way, I felt comfort. 

Suddenly I saw sights that I wish I had never seen. A world on fire. A world filled with suffering. I began to laugh uncontrollable as tears streamed down my face. I then turned around and saw many demons congregated and bowing before me as the large demon placed its crown on my head. The feeling of falling then gripped my body as I felt I was being plunged deeper into the earth. The world blurred around me as I fell into the darkness.

My eyes opened and I woke up in my bed. I didn't jump out of bed, I woke up calmly. Covered in a cold sweat, I got up quickly and went to the bathroom and washed my face.

I began to think about everything I dreamt about.

""What the hell was that?""

""What was the smell?"" 

""What was the place?"" 

""What is Sanguisrex?""

I rested my head in the sink allowing cold water to fall on the back of my head. At that moment I caught my breath and told myself that what I experienced was just a nightmare. It wasn't real, just a nightmare

It was at that moment when I said those words that felt a sting on my chest that caused me to stand up straight, and I saw it. The marking that the large demon left on my chest was there, the spiral. It appeared as a healed scar. I then knew that what I experienced wasn't just a nightmare.",2,1743512770.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I’m sorry in advance. It's been a rough couple of weeks, so I'm feeling a little scatterbrained. 

For starters, I've lost my left hand. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) 

Like I said, I'm not thinking right. Before I get into what happened, I'll begin by updating yinz on the events I left off on last time. 

The mechanic’s stunt with the ELKS worked, at least temporarily. A couple of days after that Wood Maiden clusterfuck, the Department of Wildlife presented their findings about blackpoll warblers at another hearing. This time, they were able to prove that the Endangered Species Act should be invoked to protect that patch of wilderness. 

Despite the good news, we all knew better than to get our hopes up. It was clear that something wasn't right with that company. It was only a matter of time before their overpaid lawyers found some regulatory loophole, or found another area housing territorial Neighbors to infringe upon.  

It was not over. The warbler incident only slowed them down. 

The trouble started out innocently enough. We received a call for an ant infestation. Ants. In hindsight, that was probably the client's way of being funny. He had been casual and pleasant on the phone; nothing to elicit any cause for alarm. And of course, at the time, I hadn't realized the gravity of the situation. Nobody did. 

Because of the way things have been going the past few months, we try to work in pairs now. For the most part, we have the personnel to do that, even with Deirdre being temporarily out to recover from her injuries. This time, Reyna and I had buddied up. It was a good thing, too. I doubt I'd be here if it wasn't for her. 

Speaking of The Girlfriend, she straight up told me that she was hoping to set a positive example for me by giving herself the resources to appropriately recover rather than trying to push through the pain like a ‘stubborn mule.’ I don't know where this audacity has come from, by the way. I think my coworkers have been a good/bad influence on her. I'll give yinz a hint: one of these employees has fangs and a vendetta against a dragonfly, while the other still can't ride the big kid rides at Waldameer.

But for the most part, Deirdre is healing well. She's not used to the soreness and itching that comes with those types of injuries, so she's been paranoid about infections. I've just been doing my best to assure her that all of what she was experiencing was normal, along with helping her change bandages when necessary. Keeping the wounds covered seems to settle her mind somewhat, with the added bonus of keeping her from picking at her stitches. 

It was also for the better that she wasn't around for what Reyna and I got to experience on this ‘ant infestation’ call. 

The client had informed me that his house had a guard. Like a regular person, I assumed that meant he lived in the gated community. Nope. He had a personal security guardbox planted at the forefront of his property, enclosed by what appeared to be a sturdy iron fence. 

Through the gate, I could see that the house looked less like a home and more like a monument to brutalism. All concrete and boxy shapes with the exception of the massive, circular windows. A shiny European car that didn’t seem ideal for driving along these pothole-covered back roads was parked underneath a gray, trapezoidal structure. 

In other words, it was hideous. More of a statue than a living space. Judging by Reyna's grimace, she shared my opinion on the architectural nightmare looming before us. 

In addition to the unwelcoming concrete castle, the guard was… strange. Both of us were hesitant to give him either of our names, for obvious reasons. Despite looking human, something about his demeanor gave me pause, but I couldn't put my finger on what. His movements were stiff and slow, almost mechanical. His eyes were dull and deadpan as he stared down at me. 

We went back and forth until eventually, his phone rang, then he nodded with a swine-like grunt before opening the gate. 

Reyna subtly glanced over her shoulder back at the guard booth and lowered her voice, “Something was *very* off about that guy.”

I let out a little huff of relief, “Okay, I'm glad it wasn't just me.”

“Yeah, that dude looks like he just discovered how to be human yesterday.”

“And not very well.” I agreed. 

Something moved in one of the circular windows. Frowning, I leaned closer like that would make me see better, somehow. I never claimed to be bright. Shockingly enough, I did not spontaneously develop telescopic vision and couldn't see what the source of the movement was. 

Reyna voiced my thoughts perfectly: “Will I sound like a wimp if I say that I don't want to go in there?”

I shook my head, strongly considering putting the company truck in reverse, “Not at all. Actually, I'm right there with you. Should we-”

The front door opened and the man I assumed to be the client strode out. He beamed at us, eyes concealed behind dark shades. For context, it was overcast that day. This is Pennsylvania; we get maybe two sunny days a month during the early spring, if we're lucky. It also threw me off that the client had a glowing summery tan, a stark contrast to everyone else around here who was sallow after months of drab, gray skies. Personally, my complexion was rivaling Victor's; even Reyna’s ordinarily brown skin was looking pale. 

She and I exchanged equal looks of trepidation before I rolled down the window to speak to him. 

The first thing he did was point at the sunglasses, “Forgive my big ol’ migraine glasses! You know how it is.”

I didn't, but okay. He extended a large hand to me through the window in greeting, showing off a watch that appeared more expensive than the company truck and my Jeep combined. I politely accepted, noting the firmness of his grip. He didn't give me any room to exit without hitting him with the truck's door, so I just sat there uncomfortably.

“You have an ant problem?” I asked apprehensively, doing my best to hide my nerves behind the guise of professionalism. 

The client's way of speaking was excitable, punctuated by broad, sweeping hand gestures. “Oh yeah! Big ones! Bigger than you've probably ever seen before, even in your line of work.” The client laughed like it was an inside joke. 

Clearly, the security guard wasn’t the only oddity on that property. I glanced around, wondering if we’d somehow made it below the Mounds without realizing it, or I was having one of my stress-induced, uncanny, work-related nightmares. 

When I looked back at Reyna, I saw that she was subtly shaking her head, eyes wide with worry. She wanted to leave. I was right there with her. Everything within me told me that it wouldn’t be wise to enter that house. But if he was a Neighbor - or something else - we’d need to be clever about removing ourselves from this situation. Lying would be akin to digging our own graves.

“If it's as bad as you make it sound, we might be a bit underprepared.” I felt ridiculous saying it, considering that this was supposed to be an ant infestation, but it technically wasn’t a lie. I didn’t feel prepared for whatever it was that could be waiting inside.

The client’s toothy smile did fade a bit. “From what I’ve heard, Orion Pest Control can handle just about anything. Ants should be no problem for you.”

That statement rubbed me the wrong way. Not the wording, necessarily, but the way he said it.

“What species of ant are we dealing with, exactly?” I questioned slowly.

The client shrugged, “The kind with six legs? How the hell would I know? That’s *your* expertise, isn’t it?”

Biting back irritation, I clarified, “Are these ants from our world or somewhere else?”

“I reckon they came in from outside. They don’t just sprout up in houses all willy-nilly, now, do they?” The client had another laugh at his own not-joke.

This was going nowhere. Still being professional, I let myself sound a little more firm, “Sir, for our own safety as well as yours, neither of us will set foot in that house unless you are more upfront about what is going on. Mishandling of infestations can worsen a situation. Property damage and you losing additional money is the last thing that I want for you.”

I’d expected some resistance. He set his hands on the rim of my open window, drumming his fingers thoughtfully as he replied, “Time isn’t really something I’m willing to spare all that often. It’s not infinite, nor is it some construct created by man. The reality is that time is life, and it’s ticking away with each passing second. We have wasted many breaths here that could’ve been spent more productively. I reached out to Orion because ordinarily, having the best and hiring the best is the most efficient preservation of time and consequently, life. Have I made a mistake in contacting you? Have I contributed to my and your own slow, mundane suicides?”

At the time, I'd thought only a Neighbor could speak this obnoxiously. Turns out, many types of atypical beings are capable of sounding like college students that take one philosophy class and think themselves the next Great Thinker. 

“Yes, I believe this was a mistake.” I told him, doing my best to sound regretful. “It was not our intent to inconvenience you. We will get out of your hair.”

However, the client didn’t move away from the window, though his fidgeting had stopped. For a moment, I simply saw Reyna’s and my own face reflected back at us in his shades, until he leaned in and said almost ruefully, “You’re already in the trap. You should at least see the bait.”

*Shit.*

The client went back to beaming at us, giving the top of the truck an encouraging tap, “I’ll make up some coffee. Meet you inside, ladies!”

Once he had disappeared back into the concrete monstrosity, Reyna whispered, “Just how fucked are we right now?”

With the gloom of the day, I hadn’t been able to see his shadow. The only clues about our situation were that this client was stupid rich and he thought himself highly intelligent. That wasn’t much. We were essentially flying blind. Not good, in our career path. Information is the best weapon against these things, and this client had done well to disarm us. 

With a shake of my head and a pit in my stomach, my only answer for her was, “I don’t know, and I’m not sure how much worse it’ll get if we wear out his patience any thinner.”

“So what’s the plan?”

“We stay together, no matter what,” I explained. “I’m going to call Victor before we head in. Hopefully, he and Wes can get here before anything happens.”

Reyna swallowed before informing me, “My hagstone didn’t move when he got close. Whatever he is, the stone doesn’t repel him. Maybe I can see what he is, at least? Actually, did you see anything?”

I shook my head again, telling her about how his shadow wasn’t visible thanks to our delightful Pennsylvania weather. 

When I tried to reach Victor, the phone didn't ring. The call dropped despite having full service. When I tried again, the same thing happened. Even though she had a different phone carrier, Reyna couldn't get ahold of anyone either. She looked like she wanted to cry. Likewise, I’d jumped from experiencing a vague sense of unease to outright alarm. 

If shit went south, we wouldn't even be able to call for help. We were on our own. 

“We're not helpless,” I reminded her and myself. “I've got Ratcatcher. You've got the Squelcher. We have plenty of salt, as well as the shotgun in the back. Wes has been working with you on how to use it, right?”

She nodded. Reyna was mostly used to handling human infestations, as well as other spiritual matters. She was primarily hired on as an exorcist and a healer. When it comes to combat, she tends to shy away somewhat, which I don't blame her for. 

This was also the first time Wes had been given the responsibility of training, so we were about to see how good of a teacher he was. At the very least, I could see that he instilled the basics of gun safety in her when she pulled it out of the back of the cab: finger off the trigger, safety turned ‘on’, keeping it pointed away from me. 

The front door, like the rest of the house, was gray. Its only feature was a chrome handle. Not even a window to look through. I crossed the threshold first, not surprised when I found that the inside was also monochromatic. Like the exterior, the furniture was a mixture of squares and rectangles. Curves are for poor people. Same with color. And fun. And joy. But what do I know about interior design? I chase and get chased by Celtic folklore for a living. 

The artwork hanging above the fireplace was strangely gory, despite not having a drop of blood or any viscera depicted. It was more like the implication of gore; the shapes in the frame all resembled various limbs strewn together in dull shades of black, brown, and white. Another piece displayed boxy, mechanical faces in various stages of shock. The coffee table Reyna and I passed featured the sculpture of a black hand set as a centerpiece. 

From the floor above us, I heard movement. Jerky, skittering motions. 

The client's voice called from another room, “Hope you both enjoy blonde espresso! I've been on a bit of a kick lately.”

I followed my nose, using the scent of coffee to guide us through the museum-like living room. The client had set clear glasses out on the marble island, one for each of us, filled with golden, foamy espresso. I took one of the delicate-looking cups, but didn't drink from it. Reyna followed suit. 

“Please, try some. I assure you, it's perfectly safe.” The client urged, punctuating his sentence with a sip as if that would somehow prove his innocence. “I'm not among the Good Gentlemen of the Hills. And truth be told, they would most likely find the implication that I am highly insulting.”

If that was meant to be reassuring, he missed the mark. I examined the hot beverage as if I expected a skull to show up in the foam like something from a Saturday morning cartoon. Reyna feigned drinking it by putting it to her lips without taking any of the liquid into her mouth. 

“May I ask who and what you are then?” I inquired. 

He downed the hot espresso like it was a shot of alcohol, as if that was a completely normal thing to do, before he replied, “Well, I own property all around the world, both residential and commercial, though I find residential to be the most rewarding, despite being less profitable in the long term. Especially if you sell rather than rent. Come to think of it, I think both of you live in one of my rental properties right now.” 

So my rent paid for this man's ugly house and artistically psychopathic decor. Good to know. If I didn't love electricity and indoor plumbing so much, I'd be tempted to live in a tent in the woods. And I have to say, I *really* don't love that this man has direct control over whether or not Reyna and I have roofs over our heads. 

Seemingly unaware of the discomfort he just instilled in us both, the client continued, “Real estate is only a more recent endeavor for me. Of course, recent is a relative term. Think I started… one- no, two hundred years back? Anyways, I'm sure you don't care about any of that. The point is, I'm on your side.”

“Not to be rude, but I fail to see how any of what you just said proves that.” I said cautiously. 

Despite claiming not to be a Neighbor, the client sure seemed content to be just as unnecessarily vague and verbose as one, “The Wilds need to be tamed. That's why humans began constructing homes in the first place, isn't it? Your ancestors needed to keep the forest out. The forest, and those who the trees and the hills are the most loyal to. I give you all somewhere safe to hide. Even the Wild Hunt can be rendered nearly powerless by a properly secured home. You know that.”

The Wilds. The phrase itself caught my attention. Why say it like that? And he brought up the Hunt. Meanwhile, Reyna was frowning while staring at him as if she recognized him, but couldn't quite place where she'd seen him before. 

I dared to challenge him a little, “I don't think it's fair to classify all Neighbors of the Hills in the same way as a Hunter. And even then, despite everything the Hunt has done, I can acknowledge that they have a purpose. They're not mindless animals. None of them are.”

His pitying tone drove me up the wall, “They really have beaten you down, haven't they? They're quite effective at that.”

Before I could get myself in trouble by getting defensive, Reyna spoke up, “How have they beaten you down?”

It was a good question. 

His head went down briefly, “I was to be married. Looooong time ago. I'll leave it at that.”

That's when the dots connected in my head: “*Gwythyr.*”

Subtly, the client - the Oak King, The Son of Scorcher - nodded, giving me another smile, “Guilty as charged.”

For a moment, I could only gape in disbelief. *This* was Gwythyr ap Greidawl? The White Son of Mist’s infamous rival? When I pictured the god in my head, it definitely wasn't as some affluent, polished real-estate mogul. But now the actions of his company made sense, with all of his talk of ‘taming the Wilds.’ And on that note, it explained why the Hunters hadn't gone after any of them directly: they couldn't. Per the ancient agreement with King Arthur, the Hunters couldn't touch Gwythyr or those that follow him until Calan Mai. 

It seems so obvious, now. I feel stupid for taking so long to see it. From the very beginning, the answer was right there. 

“Why are we here?” I asked, subduing my tone now that I knew the reality of who we were contending with. “Why lure us in like this if you're on our side?”

“Please understand that I didn't want this meeting to be so unpleasant,” He started. “But if the White Son of Mist's servants thought for even a moment that you spoke to me willingly, he'd have you and all of your colleagues executed, just as mine were. You will have gone from being helpful nuisances to the Hunt to enemies.”

That didn't seem right to me. Though he wasn't human, he also wasn't a Neighbor. As such, he might not be held to the same rules. Did that mean that he was capable of lying? It was best to operate under the assumption that was the case. 

“What do you want?” Reyna asked. 

“It has come to my attention that Orion, as well as many others, have acted against their own best interests and stood against our expansions.” He explained. “I wouldn't dream of asking anyone mortal to fight the Hunters; that was a lesson that Gwyn was more than happy to teach me. But I will ask that you stand down. Simply allow us to do what we must.”

I think I'm getting too used to all of this. I couldn't bite my tongue like I should have. I used to know better, and I still should. But that didn't stop me from retorting, “*Our* best interest? Each expansion just angers the Neighbors more. And it's not you that has to face the repercussions, it's *us.*”

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Reyna trying to gesture to me to stop. Instantly, I regretted being so candid. She was here, too. Just as trapped as I was. He could easily punish her for my mistake. 

Gwythyr sighed, adopting that condescending, pitying demeanor that had irritated me earlier, “That's progress for you. Things will get worse before they get better. But they *will* be better. Can you honestly tell me that isn't what you want? After all that the Wilds have done to you? To your family?”

I swallowed back the lump in my throat, trying to control myself better. Not just for my sake, but for Reyna’s. The amount he knew about us was troubling. 

Carefully, I told him, “This is a big decision, one that affects more than just those of us in this room. It wouldn't be right for me to speak or act on behalf of those who aren't present to speak their piece. If you don't mind, I would like to discuss this with my superior.”

The truth was that I wanted to get us both out of there. There was a lot of what he'd said that either seemed dubious at best or raised bright red flags at worst. 

Gwythyr sighed again, sounding disappointed, “I was hoping you'd have more sense. But after what that beast that calls himself a captain of the Wild Hunt has done to you, I suppose it stands to reason that you'd feel this way.”

He really does think of me as some kicked, brainwashed puppy. My teeth clenched involuntarily as this comparison brought to mind the mechanic’s old, demeaning nickname. Fucking puppydog. 

The noises upstairs became louder. They traveled towards where I'd noticed a set of stairs earlier. Reyna’s eyes went wide. My hand felt for Ratcatcher. 

“I'm afraid that my soldier is losing patience.” Gwythyr remarked. 

Gwythyr hadn't technically been dishonest when he called about having ‘big ants’ in his home. Though, he'd failed to mention that the insect that scampered towards us would be the size of a Great Dane. 

It was quick, too; I barely got the sword out in time before its jaws clamped onto my arm. Unlike a regular ant's, its jaws were vertical, the top one shaped like a scythe. Two long hooks jutted out from the bottom of its head, each one the length of my forearm.  

Most likely afraid that she'd hit me, Reyna tried the Squelcher first. The hell ant simply wrenched its head away to snap its mouthparts at her in annoyance, one long, whiplike antenna reaching for her. 

Salt was useless. *Great.* 

I slashed at its side. The critter hopped out of reach, now focused on Reyna. She had the shotgun aimed at it, fumbling with the safety as she backpedalled. I darted after the hell ant, swinging Ratcatcher at the leg nearest to me. The blade hit its mark, slicing into the hell ant's hindlimb. Unlike the atypical pests I'm used to, it didn't have any sort of allergic reaction to the iron. 

While all of this was going on, Gwythyr had returned to his espresso machine, humming to himself as he prepared some concoction. 

That was the moment I decided that Gwythyr was worse than Gwyn. The White Son of Mist had been terrifying when he found me below the Mounds, and he didn't hesitate to use his power to enforce submission, but he at least seemed to acknowledge humanity as fully sentient, autonomous beings, albeit ones that he finds troublesome. Meanwhile, Gwythyr appeared to believe that we should be kissing the ground he walks on for deigning to grace us with his unwanted presence. 

Then he waltzed out the door with his drink in hand, leaving his hell ant to deal with us. 

As the ant drew nearer to her, Reyna shouted, “*Get down!*”

I obliged, ducking behind the kitchen island before she opened fire. Then she screamed. When I came out of hiding, I was horrified to discover that the hell ant had bitten the shotgun's barrel clean off. 

It was getting too close to her. I went for the chitin connecting the hell ant's thorax to its abdomen, intending to slice the wretched thing in half. The insect stumbled, beginning to crumble into itself as I made the cut. 

It turned swiftly. At the same time as I brought Ratcatcher's blade into its head, that scythe-like mouthpart flashed. I couldn't breath as I felt it snap through the bones in my wrist like they were made of dry twigs. Distantly, I heard Reyna screaming again. My ears were ringing. Or maybe that was residual pressure from the espresso machine. I don't know. Everything is fuzzy. 

Numbly, I looked down to see that the white tiles were drenched in blood. Mine. The ant's. They mixed together. Both of us slipped in it. I fell next to a hand. I remember stupidly thinking, *‘How the hell did that get there?’*”

The hell ant still wasn’t dead. It was thrashing on the ground. Twitching. With the last bit of strength I had left, I withdrew the sword, then used all of my body weight to plunge it into the hell ant's head again. All was still afterwards. 

More skittering. There was another hell ant. *Another one.*

*Get up! Come on, get up!*

I felt hands on my intact arm as I struggled to stand in the mess of fluids I'd collapsed into. Reyna was pulling me away, dragging me into another room and slamming the door behind us. Together, we pushed a dresser in front, hoping to buy ourselves some time. At the end, I slid to the ground, my back still resting against the dresser.

Once the door was barricaded, she ripped her jacket off, tying it tightly around the end of my arm. I blinked at the stump. The world felt fake. My head was heavy. Reyna's voice sounded as if it was coming from underwater as she spoke. The door quaked on its hinges.

It took far too long for me to realize she was talking to me. 

“The name of the Wild Hunt!” She pleaded through tears. “The one that summons them! What is it?!” 

While in my haze of blood loss and shock, I told her. She shouted it, desperation making her voice shiver and break. Vaguely, I recall feeling guilty for scaring her. For failing to protect us both. For being the one to bring this attack on. 

The last thing I remember was her hands on my face as she kept calling me. Begging me to stay awake. I couldn't. 

Everything that followed afterwards came in lightning bolts. Glass breaking. The calls of crows. Reyna dragging me down the hall as the door and dresser were reduced to mulch. Strong arms cradling me like I weighed nothing. Black cherries. 

I came to in a white room. Between my disorientation and the room’s color pallet, it took me a moment to realize I was no longer in Gwythyr's fortress. The paper-thin, hideous gown I wore and beeping machinery attached to various regions of my anatomy told me I was about to receive another sizable hospital bill. 

The first thing I did was look down. My hand was gone. It was a very matter-of-fact, detached acceptance. 

And I'll say that one thing they don't tell you about the infamous phantom limb phenomenon is that it hurts. I keep trying to readjust sore fingers that aren't there anymore, and the attempts at movement make me ache. The pain meds are helping somewhat. 

Deirdre was asleep in the chair next to me. A troubled sleep, at that. I tried to reach for her with my remaining hand. Wanting to rouse her from whatever nightmare she was experiencing. 

When she woke up, tears instantly sparkled in her eyes as she threw herself into me, sobbing as she embraced me, “I thought I lost you. We all did.”

I didn't know what to say. All I could do was shake. 

More voices could be heard in the hallway. Mom's was one of them. She was yelling at Victor. She didn't want to blame me for getting myself into this mess, so she blamed him. He accepted it, even though he shouldn't have. She went from yelling, to apologizing, to sniffling. 

With how uncharacteristically quiet he was being, I hadn't even noticed the mechanic was in the room with Deirdre and me, leaning against the window frame as he stared apathetically at those passing by on the street beneath. 

Mom, accompanied by Reyna, instantly stiffened when she saw him. I had described him to her once before, so she was probably coming to the nerve-wracking conclusion that all of us were breathing the same air as the Wild Huntsman I'd cautioned her against. When he caught her staring at him, he winked. 

She immediately averted her gaze, face contorting in a mixture of grief and relief once she saw that I was awake. Like Deirdre, she rushed for me, as if by embracing me hard enough, she could make this situation go away. 

Maybe I should've been more concerned about my amputation. Yet, all I could think about were those hell ants. Gwythyr. What he was asking of Orion. No, not asking. Demanding. If he were asking, he wouldn't have sent his pets to butcher me and attempt to do the same to Reyna. 

It dawned on me then that Iolo had yet another life debt over not just me, but her. God damn it. Iolo's opinion of Reyna is horrendous; where those of us that love her look at her and recognize her ingenuity, her kindness, and her desire to make everyone around her smile, he sees a tender soul that he could easily break. He’s been open about that.

What if he just killed her? Or worse?

Meanwhile, Reyna was more concerned for me, as well as my Mom and Deirdre. Offering to find various hospital personnel, locate vending machines, whatever she thought would be helpful. Wes eventually came in, staying by her side and gently reminding her that she's not our nurse. Knowing that he was watching her back made me feel slightly better. 

Thankfully, Victor didn't seem to take my mom's freak out to heart, but I could tell from the moment he walked in that she was ashamed of her earlier behavior. I guess it runs in the family. 

The mechanic didn't approach me or anyone else until far later. 

Mom hadn't eaten since that morning, and it was nearing midnight. Deirdre hadn't wanted to leave me alone with the mechanic. I assured her that I'd be fine, pointing out that he could've let the hell ants tear me apart if he'd intended to harm me. Afterwards, I asked her to take care of my mom for me while I couldn't. 

Before leaving, she cast pleading eyes at him. If he saw the look she gave him, he didn't acknowledge it. 

He still didn't take his eyes off the window as he told me, “You been disappointin’ me a lot lately.”

Go figure. I've been disappointing myself lately. 

Iolo finally met my gaze, slowly crossing the room to stand at the foot of my bed, “You know you did wrong by killin’ that Wood Maiden. I can smell the guilt on you. Between what you did to her and where I just dragged you out of, I'm startin’ to wonder if this is ‘bout to become a problem.”

He wasn't wrong. It was still eating me up. 

“It isn't.” I muttered, my voice coming out scratchy.

It was like the progress we'd made with each other over the past couple of months had been erased. In that hospital room, he looked at me like a problem he wanted to take care of in the most vicious way possible. I had neither the energy nor mental clarity to be afraid. 

The Huntsman's demand was delivered calmly and coldly, “Tell me why you were there.” 

“He posed as a client,” I answered honestly, about to scratch at a phantom itch where the back of my left hand should've been. “He wouldn't let us leave until we heard him out. Given that I'm not as handy as I used to be, you can see how well that went.”

Is it healthy to make bad jokes about your own life-altering injuries? Probably not, but it's not like being serious about it will magically make it grow back. 

In all reality, I go through phases. Sometimes I crack wise about my circumstances, other times, all I can think about is the effortless way my bones snapped in the hell ant's jaws. 

When he didn't say anything, I informed him, “The thought of accepting his request didn't even cross my mind.”

The mechanic’s gaze went down to my missing hand, the stump covered in expertly-wrapped gauze. I'd felt another itch on a finger that wasn't there. 

For a moment, the coldness thawed as he remarked, “I still get that ghost-limb bullshit. Drives me up the fuckin' wall.”

“Does it get better?” I asked. 

“Not as bad as it was when it first happened.” He answered with a small shrug, coming over to steal the chair Deirdre had been napping in. “Once I get outta here, I'll look into them seeds for ya. ‘Less you wanna stick with a regular prosthetic.”

At some point, I dozed off in a morphine-induced fog. But before that, I think I made a dumb comment about getting a hook installed like a pirate. Might’ve even thrown in a ‘me bucko’ for good measure. 

Something I need to disclaim is that the conversation I'm about to describe may very well have been a snippet from a dream. 

Through my haze, I felt the comforting weight of Deirdre’s head on my shoulder. Her soft breath on my cheek. There were voices. My dulled mind faintly registered that they belonged to the mechanic and Reyna. 

She'd been describing our meeting with Gwythyr. Her summary of his behavior was and I quote: “He kept talking all about himself, mostly. Like, boasting about how fantastic he thinks he is. Ass clapping just to hear the sound of his own cheeks.”

If this was a dream, it was an incredibly realistic one, considering that is absolutely something she would say. Once I'm released, I'll have to ask her. 

(**Update:** This was a real conversation. I love you, Reyna. Deirdre has given us our blessing, which means we can get married ❤️.)

Once I was finally cognizant enough to hold a conversation, Mom informed me that I'd needed a blood transfusion among various other emergency procedures. Right now, I'm killing time by typing this out and getting into contact with someone my doctor recommended for a prosthetic, in case the seeds don't work out. And to tell the truth, after the complications he experienced, I'm reluctant to try them. 

Maybe I'll go with Morphine Nessa's brilliant suggestion to get a hook. Arrrrg, me hearties. 

**Update 2:** My hospital bill was completely paid for by an anonymous donor. I'm not entirely certain who is responsible for this generous deed. Considering that my bill was horrific, I won't look this particular gift horse in the mouth for now. I'm not going to say how much. Just know that there were a painful amount of zeros behind the [eight.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/SO6b77lmMD)

I'm visiting Montserrat from Barcelona with my mother on Wednesday 9 April and I would really appreciate and benefit from some help planning for the day. So thank you in advance.

For context, we are travelling there on our own by public transport (R5 line and cable car). We plan to visit the Montserrat Monastery (not watching Boy's choir), museum, have lunch, and take the funiculars up/down for the views.

So far, I have seen multiple people suggesting the Trans Montserrat Card/ToT Montserrat Card and we are planning to get the Trans card to cover all core transport and entry to the Monasterry. However, it also says on Barcelona's Turisme's website, that *access to the Black Madonna and basilica is included, no pre-booking required but ticket holders must queue for entry*.

My question here is:

1. As no pre-booking is required, is entry still guaranteed and we can do it anytime of the day? How long should we expect the wait to be?
2. Approximately how long would it take to visit the whole the Monastery, if we are not queuing to see the Black Madonna?
3. Is the Museum worth seeing?
4. . Aware that there will be a lot of groups and tours, what's the best way to plan for the day to avoid the crowd? Should we start with the funiculars and get the views early then visit the Monasterry after 2:30/3:00pm assuming it will be a little less crowded as the groups start to leave?
5. Finally, do you have any suggestions of decent restaurants/coffee shops at Montserrat?

They are taught how to fight, how to blend in situations(like dancing, ballet, gymnastics, singing, and other talent stuffs), etc.

( My inspo was Hydra from Marvel. Though be noted, I barely know anything about Hydra since I haven't watched Black Widow's movie. But I do know they're bad from what I see online. )

The headmaster isn't necessarily cruel, but isn't very nice either. Maybe a vigilante behind the scenes? Headmaster has a soft spot for Quirkless people, especially kids. Though aside from them, headmaster hates everyone else. Headmaster wants to raise Quirkless children and turn them into people that can show the world they aren't useless. Headmaster raised them into extremely talented people blending in society. 

I meantioned that it's only from elementary from middle school, right? After that the children are free to choose any school or stay. The children who left are also allowed for summer school. 

And surprise surprise, headmaster isn't broke but he's not rich enough to fund the school. Guess who's sponsor the school? AFO. Headmaster hated the idea at first, but ever since their community started growing, he had no choice. There were agreements of course. AFO gets to observe the children and give quirks he didn't need to some of them (to the headmaster's annoyance) or give acceptable quirks to those he finds interesting. 

Izuku after getting accepted to UA :

*arrives at school super early because of his fixed schedule*

*crawls inside the vents*

*gets noticed by Nedzu who merely laughed in amusement and watched him*

1jouxfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1jouxfs/why_men_blame_the_apps_for_their_failings/,Why men blame the apps for their failings :/,"I read post after post from men blaming the apps and women for their undateability. They post profile reviews with horrible picture and bios, they are too lazy to take decent pictures or think they can look for casual, the most competitive category, with a dirty bathroom mirror selfie.

Men blame algorithms for their own incompetence because why would they take 5 minutes to find out what really works! They mass swipe leaving women to do all of the heavy lifting and then complain that there are so few women on the apps. They really believe they are a victim. When I was on the apps so many men wasted their own time messaging me (some apps allow for messaging without matching), they clearly did not meet my very clearly stated preferences but thought they deserved a chance. These men were much older, incredibly unattractive, different politics and on and on. Men should learn to stay in their own lane while dating and stop pretending that any woman will be interested in them. 

Men claim women only date Chads, but the real story is [men only message the most attractive women.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/199xcck/outing_the_lies_spread_by_men_that_women_only/) Men will debate, battle and argue with women in other subs who try to help them, don't waste your breath. They want to date liberal women, but they are a conservative. They want a coffee date but approach women who do not go on low effort dates. Men will do anything but date their real match because they are so entitled. They spin their wheels and waste their own time believing that a younger more attractive woman will be interested in them.

It is not the algorithm or women, it is men. Men have ruined dating apps and women are exiting in record numbers causing stocks to crash. You cannot shame women into joining apps where they are abused and harassed, expecting women to do all of the heavy lifting that comes with dating and relationships for what? Men want a cheat code, but they face competition in dating because women have opted out in very large numbers. Men are angry that women are selective, we have to be, we have much more to lose in partnering with men. 

I paid for apps hoping to find a better quality of men but I found they were on all of the apps, mindlessly swiping and complaining. So many men have complained and it was such a turn off, they bemoan all of the swipes (mindless and fruitless) because they refuse to read profiles. No woman is impressed by a mindless like or ""Hey beautiful"". Men are not listening to women, they are out there shooting their shoot and themselves in the foot.

As more research discloses the absolute divide between men and women, women are choosing to deceneter men and enjoy their lives. Men are throwing mantrums about not being able to find a woman. So many have quiet quit men and I admit that it will soon be a year since I went on a date (with a man) and it has been heavenly!

To any women still on the apps block men quickly and often, men are a risk to women's health and happiness, they know this but it does not stop them from wanting to attach and extract resources. 

I have my popcorn ready watching the demise of dating apps at the hands of men, men scrambling but not doing anything to make themselves appealing. They listen to other men and the advice they receive will leave them single. They can 6/6/6 themselves to the end of the line because they refuse to listen to women, why would they, they hate women and hate that they tie their identity to women. 

Cheers!

A couple of years ago, when I was living in another country, I organized a pop-up coffee shop with baristas in wheelchair. It was tough, but we made it work! My goal wasn’t just to run a (barely profitable) business—I wanted to challenge public perceptions of people with disabilities. Where I lived, they were either invisible or not seen as full members of society.

Now I’m in London, and at first, I considered doing something similar. But here, I see people with disabilities out and about, included in public life, and treated with respect. So I’m wondering—would a business like this even serve a real purpose here? Would I struggle to find workers?  
  
I know this kind of job might not be suitable for people with cervical or thoracic spinal injuries or SMA. But for many others, with the right setup—a well-organized rest area, a good coffee machine, and an ergonomically designed space—it could be a great place to work.

Hey MaximizeMe fam! You ever have one of those ""Aha!"" moments that’s basically just a fancy way of saying ""Oh, no""? Yeah, that was me last week, staring at my meticulously color-coded calendar, wondering why it felt like a straightjacket rather than a productivity booster. 😅

**So, here’s the thing:** I bought into the time blocking hype big time. Color-coded blocks for work, gym, Netflix—heck, even downtime had its own color! Spoiler alert: it felt utterly overwhelming. Who knew giving every task its own tiny box would feel like cramming my whole life into a Tetris game I was losing!

But instead of spiraling into despair, I tried something new. *Here’s what worked for me and saved me 10 hours a week:*

1. **Ditch the Perfection Trap:** I mean, seriously, who decided every single task needs its own color? I embraced *The Rule of Three*. Each day, I pick three main tasks. That's it. If I conquer more, that’s just extra credit.

2. **The Power Hour:** No, I’m not talking about the drinking game (though tempting!). I start my day with one focused, uninterrupted hour tackling my toughest task. No distractions, just me and coffee ⚡️. It’s amazing what you can get done when you *don’t* have Instagram open in another tab.

3. **Weekly Flex Time:** Instead of blocking every minute, I block *chunks* of time during the week as “flex time.” It's adaptable, it means I can move things around if needed, and it’s perfect when life throws curveballs like, I don’t know, surprise meetings or Netflix dropping a new season.

4. **Reflect and Adjust:** At the end of the week, a quick review session. What felt good? What felt like pulling teeth? Then, tweak it. Because who knew that life doesn’t fit into tidy boxes? 🙃

I’ve found this approach less stressful and way more fun. My days might not be rainbow-colored, but they’re definitely more manageable.

So, friends, if you’ve ever felt trapped by time blocking, or any other “productivity hack” for that matter, you’re not alone! Sometimes, the simplest shifts make the biggest impact. Trust me, if I can save 10 hours a week, there’s hope for all of us.

1jour5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1jour5m/the_thread_on_miscarriage_yesterday_made_me_want/,"The thread on miscarriage yesterday made me want to share my story of my pretty typical miscarriage, pregnancy, and postpartum period.","I wanted to write up my experience with pregnancy and miscarriage after seeing a thread yesterday about ""what you do with a miscarriage"". All of these events happened years ago, and I've gotten therapy since. So I'm ready to share. I'm writing from the perspective of a cis woman married to a man living in the US for the context of my situation. 

My husband and I had decided to try for a baby. I got my IUD removed. I had a ""pre- conception checkup"" at the doctor. I tracked my cycles and took my prenatal vitamins. I read a lot of books about pregnancy. Finally I took a test and saw those 2 unmistakable lines on it. I was thrilled and so was my husband. 

About a month later, I started lightly bleeding. It was a Friday, and I wanted to see an OB/GYN who I was familiar with, so I scheduled an appointment for that afternoon out of an abundance of caution. The ultrasound tech there is wonderful. She has strings of Christmas lights hung in the dark room and she decorated it with pictures of her dogs. She even has a drawer of candy to share with patients. 

The doctor, a kind, older gentleman who is good at explaining things from his time as a medical school professor, came in and looked at the images on the screen with the technician. They found the embryo and there was an unmistakable heartbeat. I was so happy- my baby had a heartbeat! The doctor said that in his experience, miscarriage is less likely when the embryo has a heartbeat at this stage. He told me to go home, do my best to relax, and if things got worse, not to be afraid to come to the hospital. He was scheduled to be on the rotation that weekend. 

I went to the grocery store to buy some heavy pads. I was sort of in a daze, and I just remember mentally repeating to myself ""Please don't let me miscarry my first pregnancy. Please don't let me miscarry my first pregnancy.""

The next day, my husband wanted to get my mind off things for at least a little while. He suggested we go see the newest Marvel movie in a local theater that has cozy reclining seats. I did enjoy the film and it did make me happy. We stayed all the way until after the credits, just to make sure we didn't miss a thing. 

After that, I felt some cramping. I told my husband that I needed to go to the bathroom. I miscarried, by myself, in a public restroom. I saw a bit of the remains, but I didn't have a chance to get a decent look because it was an automatically flushing toilet. 

In a world where abortion is murder, miscarriage is manslaughter. 

Under some of the strict proposed laws, would I be investigated for improper disposal of fetal remains? I had been to a doctor and there had been a heartbeat. Was it the fact that I still had a cup of coffee each morning? Was I too anxious of a person and that ruined things? Would the OB/GYN be forced to report a pregnancy with a suspicious ending?

I had done everything right according to these politicians. I got married. My husband was the breadwinner. We wanted to be parents. It was a ""textbook"" miscarriage. Not out of the ordinary. Common, actually. 

A couple of months after that, I had a ""chemical pregnancy"", which is a miscarriage that happens early enough that you get a positive pregnancy test, but then the lines on the tests fade away and you get a heavy period about 5 weeks after your last one. They got the name ""chemical pregnancy"" because the only sign is the ""chemicals"" (hormones) that make a test turn positive. I guess some people think calling it that makes it sting less. I just felt stupid for testing at all, though given that my periods are 28 days on the dot, I still would have noticed when one was late. 

We kept trying, and I got another positive pregnancy test. My husband was cynical and didn't do a good job of handling his grief. I told him about the positive test, and he asked ""is this one going to die too?"" As the pregnancy progressed, he kept asking me, ""is this the point where we can stop worrying?"" I told him that the only time that he'll be able to stop worrying is ""Either when it dies or you do. Whichever comes first."" 

That pregnancy had no complications. I had morning sickness so bad that I threw up while driving on the interstate. On another occasion first trimester fatigue was so bad that I almost fell asleep behind the wheel. I have scars from stretch marks and the skin on my stomach will always be a bit loose. 

I had a full term vaginal birth with no complications. But it was still hard- I had a 2nd degree tear and I needed a year of pelvic floor physical therapy to regain sexual function. The physical therapy bills were more expensive than the medical bills for the rest of the pregnancy. Something like 85% of women who give birth vaginally tear. Most of them never get treatment and just suffer with any after effects in silence. 

I also got treatment for diastasis recti, which is when the abdominal muscles separate due to pregnancy. Mine were bad enough that the physical therapist could stick a couple of fingers through the gap. She said it's not unusual. Sixty percent of women who carry a pregnancy to term get it. For women with C-sections, I can only imagine that recovery is harder. A woman I work with had it with multiple pregnancies, and she permanently lost her ability to yell, because her abs are too messed up to support her diaphragm with that. Imagine raising 3 boys and being unable to raise your voice above their noise. But that's all considered normal and expected.

Breastfeeding was extremely painful at first. Babies can be lazy, I guess, and try to latch on in a way that is painful for the mother. My ripples bled. I had to pump for weeks and give her a bottle while I healed. A lactation consultant told me that it wasn't out of the ordinary. 

When my uterus shrank back down after the pregnancy, it folded over on itself. So I now have a ""retroflexed"" uterus. That's not out of the realm of normal either.

I also had another close brush with having a car accident. I had taken my daughter to my in-law's house so she could spend the afternoon being rocked by her grandmother in the rocking chair. On the way back, my daughter shrieked because she wanted to be up with me instead of safely buckled in her car seat. I was not functioning properly because of sleep deprivation. The baby needed to eat every 2 hours. So I would wake up, spend 20 minutes nursing her, 20 minutes holding her upright so that she wouldn't spit up and choke to death on her own vomit, then I'd hand her to my husband for a diaper change and rocking while I attempted to doze for 1 hr 20 min before repeating the cycle again. Getting less than 5 hours of sleep is just as bad as driving drunk. (https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/advice/best-cars-blog/2016/12/drowsy-driving-worse-than-drunk-driving)

I hit a curve too fast because I was desperate to get home and just. end. the SCREAMING. My car spun 270 degrees. We were lucky. We were OK. But people joke about being that sleep deprived. Some women have husbands who won't wake up to help at all. I wonder how many of the stereotypes of ""bad women drivers"" from the mid 20th century are from men mercilessly mocking women dealing with miscarriage, pregnancy, and the postpartum period with its associated sleep deprivation alone. Mocking instead of helping. 

None of the male politicians whining about a ""baby shortage"" care about these things. I'm pretty sure that the reason that some women see a pregnant person and trauma dump stories of hard births, is because they were told that they have no right to be traumatized. ""Just be happy you have a healthy baby"". Pain during childbirth is literally a risk factor for post partum post traumatic stress disorder (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5387093/), yet there are women who feel pressured to have a ""natural"" birth because some people see it as a badge of honor. 

People say that just making it more affordable to have babies will make people have more kids. Sure, that's probably true for some people. But it also requires acknowledging how hard pregnancy is. No one should ever be forced to miscarry at work and then immediately get back to the cash register. No one should have to be at work, heavily bleeding (you have heavy bleeding for over a month after giving birth). Without paternity leave, society forces women to suffer the brunt of the sleep deprivation during the post partum period. Women shouldn't feel like they have to suffer through painful sex or urinary incontinence because ""that's just how things are."" 

Telling someone that a difficult hike up a mountain is actually a pleasant walk in the park isn't helpful. It just leaves them unprepared and feeling betrayed when things are more difficult than expected. Sure, being honest might mean that some people don't want to do the hike. But that is the whole point of informed consent, isn't it?",3,1743511716.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,0.8,False

1jouq78,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jouq78,Minoxidil 5% foam absolutely works.,"As many of us on this page, I have struggled for a long time with hair that was once thick and beautiful, but turned into a thin, stringy, crazy frizzy sad mess.  It hurts you to not have beautiful hair. Painful to go outside and be seen. The charade to prepare to go out significantly more difficult. 

I wanted to share my photos, in hopes of reaching people with hair like mine.  My starting point was not minimal thinning, but much worse.  And my current state is not luscious, back to normal thick hair. But the development progress is fantastic, and I will update in another months. I feel better about my hair, and my confidence has greatly improved. 

All photos were taken outside during the day or near a window during the day (my hair looks thinner doing that, but that is what the world sees, so it is the most fair representation). Also, I am a side-part girl, but the photos are center part for a better view of the changes. 

Initial Start:
I did not want to use chemicals. Rather than start with minoxidil, I started daily collagen powder with a cup of coffee and 3 Nutrafol a day.  If you are weary of applying chemicals, I thought it would be helpful to see progress pictures without minoxidil.  Took the vitamins daily for one year (ish).  The results can be seen in photo 1.

Moving to chemical help:
After getting noticeable results without chemicals, I took the plunge and decided to try 5% minoxidil foam from Costco and continued with collagen powder (if anyone has a brand similar but less expensive to vital proteins, please share).

The minoxidil definitely works faster. I only apply the 5% foam after washing and air drying my hair (~3 times a week).  Because the results are so more pronounced with the foam, I am considering moving to daily application.  2nd picture shows moving from Nutrofol to Minoxidil. 

Observations using Minoxidil:
1) I did not have horrible period of initial mass shedding 
2) hair stopped shedding completely after 1 month (maybe 2 hairs every shower attach themselves to my fingers)
3) I am no longer afraid to clean my hair (finger scrub)
3) I am no longer afraid to brush my hair (especially at the scalp)

We apologize if the news of massacres ruined your morning coffee.  
We apologize if, while scrolling through your phone, you came across a picture of a burned child from Gaza and it spoiled your day.  
We apologize if the screams of our women disturb you.  
We apologize because we are being killed against our will, and there is nothing we can do to stop it.  

I write to you from the heart of tragedy, from yet another displacement, not knowing how it will end.  
We were displaced again, as if the first time was not enough, as if deprivation and homelessness were not enough. We left once more, searching for a place beyond the reach of bombs, but there is no safe place here. Even the sky is our enemy. Even the ground we walk on could explode beneath us at any moment.  

I fled with my injured father, struggling to move, his pain unrelenting. We carry him over the rubble, through the scattered stones, across streets that are no longer streets—just craters and narrow paths. We search for water, for food, for shade, for a place to sit without fear, but we find none.  

The bombing is now more intense than ever, as if the genocide has just begun. We wait for our death with open eyes, imagining the missile before it falls, seeing corpses before they become corpses. If I leave this time, tell my friends in paradise that I am on my way, and they should make room for me—I have so much to tell them. Tell my cousin that I miss him dearly and that I won’t be long.  

I entrust you with every child here, for every child in Gaza needs a safe embrace. I entrust you with Gaza’s women, whom war has stripped of every meaning of femininity. I entrust you with the stones, for within them lies enough love to fill the entire world. And if you ever find my body, bury me with dignity—do not let this Nazi Zionist occupier take it.

1joujcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/viwoods/comments/1joujcn/my_experience_with_viwoods_aipaper_in_academia/,"My experience with ViWoods AiPaper (in academia): fantastic eInk tablet at 10.7""","**My use case**: I am in academia and use the device \~8 hours per day, mainly writing notes during meetings, annotating PDFs, reading technical books in libraries, and reading fantasy books in the evenings.

I am using the 'big' version, the AiPaper at 10.7 inches (not the Mini version).

(I also posted this a while ago in the eInk Reddit group but wasn't sure how to share it here as well - not very experienced with Reddit, so just posting it here as well).

Why I prefer it over all other eInk devices I've had / tried over the past 8 years:

**The whitest eInk tablet screen currently on the market**

* The AiPaper is the first eInk device I can comfortably use in cozy lightning environments without a front light. In local libraries, coffee shops, I've always had to turn on my Kindle Scribe front light to some degree to not squirm my eyes. Now with the very good contrast on the AiPaper I no longer need it (a bunch of videos on YouTube show the whiteness and contrast side by side with other devices, e.g. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyvuZkrJm0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyvuZkrJm0I) at 6:00).
* I've tried many other eInk devices without front light over the years (some of it is in my post history, e.g. recently posted about my reMarkable Paper Pro experience) but always reverted back to the Kindle Scribe because of its front light and eInk tech still equating grey rather than white screens (the AiPaper is not white like paper, but the least grey of them all).
* As a result of the lack of the front light layer, the text is a little sharper and the writing feels much better than on the Kindle Scribe because the pen-to-surface distance is shorter.

**Engaged software development team**

* The device has been on the market for \~6 months now during which the software development team of ViWoods has developed new features at high speed (e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/viwoods/comments/1jk9i5t/viwoods_aipaper_update_version_36coming_in_2_weeks/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/viwoods/comments/1j5lz28/v355_update_rolling_out_gradually/)). Hence they seem really committed to their product (rather than focused on churning out one generic eInk device after the other) and I look forward to every monthly update.
* New features are exactly the ones that the community wants most (tracked through a dedicated 'Community' dashboard [here](https://viwoods.com/pages/community) that can also be accessed from the home page of the device, very nice).
* The ViWoods responses and interaction with the community are also very good: not corporate jargon, and actual human answers (I was reading [this blog post](https://supernote.com/blogs/supernote-blog/why-supernote-deliberately-has-no-front-light?srsltid=AfmBOoppKl6lzSk9EeEyKdM9hVCK8nKOVpjvZiG5PZszA61XfGg-729d) by Supernote recently and found it off-putting because it's so obviously A.I. generated, the bloated writing style and using the word 'realm' on top of it, my GPTZero and Grammarly browser extensions also immediately flagged it as > 99% A.I.).

**Build + design quality**

* The AiPaper looks great (similar to the reMarkable devices, credits to them as well). It is well thought out, for instance not having a pure white border but rather a white-grey border that matches the eInk screen (contrary to the new Kindle Scribe and the Supernote Manta which I find makes them more distracting and ugly).
* The screen is Mobius plastic rather than glass (which is very prone to breaking, i.e. the recent Onyx Carta 1300 threads). The plastic makes it more flexible - even without the case I cram it in my backpack more confidently than previous glass devices I had (I've had the Pixel 4A phone for a long time now as well which is the last plastic phone of its generation, really prefer any device I use in my hands to be plastic rather than glass).
* Also sturdy but very light (370 gram - lighter than some phones I've handled) and thin.

**Comparison with Kindle Scribe and reMarkable Paper Pro**

* Like my (jailbroken) Kindle Scribe, which is also a very good eInk tablet, it has 300 pixels per inch (PPI) so very sharp text, but it has much more features (not the distracting ones such as social media apps but rather useful ones, e.g. better PDF annotating features related to cutting margins, the ability to change PDF font size, syncing with non-Amazon cloud, task management, use with Bluetooth keyboard, and so on).
* Versus reMarkable Paper Pro I had but returned, the text on the AiPaper is much sharper and easier to read (300 PPI versus the 229 PPI which all the reMarkable devices top out at) and also, again, it has much more useful features. But no color of course, which I would find handy at some point mainly to read graphs, but I feel like color eInk tech is not there yet (given the inherent graininess of the screens, and Canvas flickering, not worth it yet to me).

**Bluetooth keyboard; use as external monitor**

I typed this review on the AiPaper itself; you can connect a Bluetooth keyboard to it and start typing away, great experience with hardly any delay (make sure to put it on Ultra Fast Refresh Mode). You can also use it as kind of an external monitor (e.g. through novnc / spacedesk - I found Duet Display to be the fastest although it's paid so I'd prefer to have another free solution - I wonder if the the USB-C port would allow for some kind of video transmission).

For some workflows I find it very relaxing to not type on my 3 big LCD monitors in the office but rather use the AiPaper for that (e.g. creating outlines for presentations, or actual LaTeX writing itself).

**Future**

What I mainly hope for is some backup functionality to be able to quickly restore the device in case it breaks and I need to replace it. Right now I export everything I have from the ViTransfer app on a daily basis not to lose all my daily notes (I need to 100% keep track of them for students during the semester) but I'm not sure if I can easily import them again. In any case it seems like this kind of functionality is already in the works by the software team.

Perhaps once some kind of local (or cloud) backup option is there, another feature in the future may be to be able to keep the AiPaper and AiPaper mini in sync in case one has 2 devices (may consider the Mini at some point for on-the-go use).

Hope it helps if you're considering this device!",7,1743511072.0,viwoods,0,0.9,False

Everything in my life is more or less fine (maybe even pretty good) with the exception of having a social circle. I didn't expect myself to ever reach the place of having zero friends. Zero. Damn, dude.

Every personal achievement I make doesn't matter because there's no one to share it with. No one to tell about it. No one to care about it. 

I could go out and try to befriend someone, but it's hard for several reasons. The biggest one is just my personality.

I'm kind of just a selfish asshole that doesn't care about anyone else. Or doesn't want to bother getting invested into anyone else's life because I don't believe in the relationship lasting anyway. My standards are kinda high and I abandon people too easily. I don't call myself an asshole because I have a low self-esteem or because I hate myself, I just think that it's how things truly are. If some cats are natural assholes, why can't some people be natural assholes as well? I'm non-empathetic, stand-offish, quick to judge, sarcastic, cynical, pessimistic, etc. Very bad, very cringe.

Maybe some of these things are in my control and maybe I can try to be friendlier, but I'm just really burnt out at this point. I've met so many people in my life and I don't talk to any of them anymore. Burnt out on asking questions, burnt out on having to fake that I care. Burnt out on trying to believe that things will work out.

I'm also shit at having normal conversations. I'm only invested in deep conversations, but my interests are way too specific and way too few. I don't care about things that most people care about, like movies, games, fashion, etc. Being interested in games and having the energy/confidence to hop in some discord calls could solve a lot, but I just can't do it.

Making friends as a teen was easier. When you're young, you're just naturally more passionate about everything. You're also stupider, so there's more introspection to be made, more things to discover, more conversations to have. It's easier to find topics to talk about, it's easier to talk just in general. Nowadays it's a burden.

My personality is wasting my life. So much joy could've been had if I just wasn't me. Maybe I should look into a fecal transplant to change my gut biome or something, idk lol. Whatever.

'One year ago Lex went to Indonesia on a quest to find the most unique coffee in the world. He remained unsuccessful for the first half year until he befriended this local civet cat. While taking a hike together they discovered a high altitude waterfall in the midst of the Javanese highlands. They came across coffee trees that resembled the famous gesha variety. 

He collected enough cherries for a small batch and over the next weeks fed them to his new nocturnal companion. 

The result is something the coffee world has never seen before. Single variety, single lot, single Luwak. It all ends here.'

They are in the early undiagnosed stage.  I am assuming that they are in the early stages because of the overwhelming changes I am seeing in both of them,  and from input from this forum.   They refuse to go to a doctor,  so I'm using my best judgement.  

In the past we used to have favorite things to do together like going out for coffee,  visiting stores etc.  We used to do them on a regular basis.  Now,  it seems that I can't get a ""routine"" activity to stick anymore.  All the things we used to do we only do them if I  initiate it.  They no longer call me in advance to make plans for these routine activities. If we discover a new coffee place,  and everyone seems to agree we need to go again,  my dad and step mom don't ask to go again.  They are happy to go,  however,  if I arrange it.  I'm a bit sad,  because I feel that that part of our relationship has deteriorated and could possibly mean more changes to come.  Has anyone else experienced this in the early stages?

We have been together for 5 years and married for 2 years. I'm starting to have a feeling that this relationship is draining me both physically and emotionally. Please be straightforward and honest with me, if I'm being crazy or he is driving me crazy?

A little information here, I’m the main provider to our household, constantly working long hours, its almost 12 hours since the minute I woke up till the time I get home. On the other hand, he mostly works from home, 8 hours and he is done. And in the past three years, he quit his job once and got laid off twice. So, he spent a lot of time home being “busy”. When I get home from work, there are always dishes on the coffee table or in the sink. Since I also cook dinner for us, I have to clean the dirty pot and dishes first before I can start to cook.

The problem is when I ask him to do something around the house whether he is working or just chilling at home, he will forget 2 out of 3 things. I have to constantly chase him, “hey remember you said you are going to do this; did you do this yet?” This created tension between us, he got annoyed and often said if it bothers you this much, why don't you get it done. Then I got frustrated, I stopped asking him to do stuff, but I built up huge resentment towards him. Keep in mind, I wasn’t asking for the moon, I asked him to put away his dishes after he ate lunch while watching TV, or please put away the Christmas tree since it’s February already. It wasn’t until mid-March he finally did it after we had a huge fight about it. Same thing with dishes, we had so many fights about it. Did it work? Yes. But the problem is in his mind, I’m the villain in every situation. He told me that every time he saw the dishes on the coffee table, he started to panic, because he knew I would be pissed if I saw that after I got home. He is constantly worried about me getting mad. I would say something like then just put away the dishes when you are done, then you don’t have to stress about it, and I don’t have to get mad about it. He would accuse me of being insensitive and wanted me to apologize to him. I feel like he is baiting me, so I would be the villain. For example, it shouldn’t take a month to put away the Christmas tree, or it shouldn’t take 3 weeks to put away the extension cord that he used and left on the dining room table. I remined him once, nothing. Twice, nothing. Three times, nothing. Until I get mad and fight him about it, he gets it done. but says to me “why can’t you say it nicely, why you have to so mean about it.” Then he wants me to apologize for being mean or lash out. I feel like I’m stuck in this dead-end circle. No matter what I do, I’m always wrong. I know people might say “if you know you guys would fight about it, why don’t you get it done then?” I feel like I’m doing enough, I make twice as much as him, so I cover most of our joint expenses, I cook, I clean, and I do the laundry for both of us. I feel like asking him to clean up after himself isn’t too much to ask for.

And other small things like taking a 30-minute-long shower in the morning while I’m still sleeping. I told him many times, you are not just waking me up, you are keeping me up the entire time while you shower. Keep in mind that we are 3 bathrooms. He could just take a shower in the other bathroom. But no, he still does that every day until I get mad and fight him about it. He said why can’t I shower where I want? Why are you so bossy? I seriously don’t know if he just got get it or just simply baiting me.

 

Guys, am I crazy? I feel like I’m going to snap. I feel like his mom, and I hate that about me. But I just don’t know what to do.",1,1743509916.0,u_Correct-Mess1047,0,1.0,False

I fell in love with *The Coffee Roaster's Companion* by Scott Rao when I first came across it. By recommendations in this sub, I believe :)

I'm just a home roaster; after years of popcorn machines I finally graduated to the SR800. In a mix-up with the roaster I buy beans from, I wound up with a big lot of natural processed beans and had to ""jump in"" roasting them before I was ready. The coffee gods smiled up this, apparently, because I'm drinking the first of it now and it's sublime... anyway!

I have the same Rwandan varietal (same farms, same washing stations, same trading company) in two processed forms: Washed and Natural. I think the washed ferments for not longer than 36 hours, then is fully depulped and dried. Moisture content is 11%. The natural sits in the sun for 20-25 days, then is depulped, washed (no ferment) and dried. Moisture content 11.5%

I've been roasting both for more than a year, but this was my first go of the natural on the SR800. (I'd done a couple of the washed already). My roast goal is always ""city"" (end of first crack - personal taste preference).

Rao's **general** guidlines say a bean with higher moisture content can take a higher charge temperature well (and a higher charge temp = higher outer/inner delta T, conducive for better development on light roasts).

My question: experience has taught me this particular natural processed bean is MUCH better when charged at a LOWER temp than it's washed cousin. I take both to city roast, but the natural comes out best with a lower temp, longer roast. If I ""push it"" (say I roast the natural exactly the same as the washed), then all the lovely raspberries and dark chocolate notes disappear. The washed version of this bean just doesn't have those exotic flavors/aromas (although it's very good) no matter how I've permuted my roasting.

Is there a structural difference (e.g. tough cellulose matrix, density?) or something else in the natural that makes it benefit from a cooler, slower roast than it's **drier** cousin?

EDIT: If I roast the washed per the charge/time I give the natural, I do not get sufficient inner bean development on the city roast profile I'm shooting for. I.e. the outer bean roasts too fast.

1jou3xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingEdge/comments/1jou3xw/im_a_full_time_trader_and_this_is_everything_im/,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of the trading day 01/04 as commodities continues to rally ahead of ISM and JOLTS data out soon.,"ANALYSIS:

* For analysis points on the market, and individual stocks, see the posts made on the [r/Tradingedge](/r/Tradingedge/) feed this morning.

MACRO:

* Today we have the ISM manufacturing data, as well as the JOLTs numbers.
* Positioning shows traders continue to hedge ahead of this data. Expectation is for weak manufacturing data and rising prices. Weak jobs numbers could see yesterday's gains faded again back to the 5500 support. 

  
MARKET:

* Commodities positioning continues to strength. notably on Gold, Silver and Oil.
* Market put in a failed breakdown yesterday, recovering from the lows of 5480 to get comfortably above the 5500 support. However, most of the buying came from pension fund end of quarter rebalancing and the roll of the JPM collar. Nothing fundamentally changed here. delivered 36,674 vehicles in March, up 26.5% YoY and nearly 40% over February. Q1 deliveries reached 92,864, up 15.5% YoY but down 41% from Q4.

MAG 7:

* AMZN - Mizuho rates them outperform, PT of 285. Sees softer 1H AWS growth, but FY2025 budget is still in tact. ""We recently completed our quarterly AWS customer survey through a top channel partner and observed softer indicators for the first time since 1Q23, driven by negative macro sentiment. However, AWS customers are still maintaining a full-year 2025 budget of 20% YoY growth"".
* TSLA - sale of new cars in Denmark fell by 65.6% in March from the same month a year ago to 593 vehicles, registration data from Mobility Denmark showed on Tuesday.
* TSLA - remains the only underweight name in Wells Fargo's tactical ideas list. They named it a tactical short idea, cites delivery shortfalls, Price cut pressures and cybercab skepticism. 
* TSLA - sales in France dropped nearly 37% in March, marking the third straight monthly decline and the weakest Q1 in the country since 2021
* META's pushing the Trump admin to fight back against an expected EU fine and order tied to the bloc’s Digital Markets Act. The decision could force Facebook and Instagram to offer ad-free access without tracking, threatening a major chunk of Meta’s revenue. 
* AAPL - CITI SAYS 'RISK REWARD LOOKS ATTRACTIVE' AHEAD OF WWDC. expanding Apple Intelligence into several new languages, including simplified Chinese, and making it available in the EU. As expected, the update does not include Siri enhancements due to the previously announced delay.

OTHER COMPANIES:

* BA - News that BA cut 737 MAX output to 31/month from 38. This was to protect the assembly line from derailing apparently. Boeing however denies reports of 737 MAX production swings, saying output hasn't reached 38 jets per month this year and hasn't recently dropped either, countering claims it fell back to 31 due to wing system delays. 
* BA, FCX - both added to JPM focus list. 
* CHKP, COF, CPRI, LLY, PTCT, ROKU all included in Wells Fargo overweight list
* Airlines - Jefferies downgraded the entire industry, cutting AAL and DAL to hold and LUV to underperform.

* ULTA - Godlamn upgrades to buy, raises PT to 423 from 385. concerns over normalization in beauty category sales and prestige market share erosion. However, as we look into FY25, we believe those concerns have largely bottomed.
* LYV - Trump will sign an exec order to fight ticket scalping. 
* KDP - MS upgrades KDP to overweight, raises PT to 40 from 38. we believe the market is not fully recognizing the company’s building corporate organic sales growth (OSG) and EPS growth potential versus CPG peers. This is supported by visible strength in its U.S. Refreshment segment and solid international results, despite near-term coffee profit risk.
* PYPL - Bernstein lowers PT of PYPL to 80 from 94. PayPal is either a multi-bagger or a structural short stock over a three-year time horizon. The problem: we currently lack conviction on which outcome is more likely

Hey, I’m a Black male living in West London, looking for someone to chat with and maybe meet up if we vibe. I enjoy football, reading, and adult-themed dancing—yes, a bit of a mix, but it keeps life interesting! Whether it’s discussing a great book, watching a match, or sharing good conversation, I’d love to connect with someone open-minded and fun. If you’re up for a friendly chat, let’s see where it goes. No pressure, just good vibes and interesting conversations. Drop me a message if you’re interested. Happy to go for  chat first and then meet up for coffee at one point and take it from there. Thanks 😊. Oh also i love swimming. We can perhaps gor for some swimming sessions  during the summer since it's heating up. ",1,1743509612.0,r4r,1,0.67,False
1jou25d,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1jou25d/referring_to_me_as_someone/,"Referring to me as ""someone""","My SO refers to me as ""someone"". Listed below are a few examples of occurances that he has said. 

1. It's nice to be cared for by someone. 
2. It felt good to get a call from someone. 
3. I was going through a tough time and i couldn't turn that off when someone else decides to stop by. 
4. It would be odd to travel and have coffee at the park with someone. 
5. It feels nice to have someone speak kindly of me

I think you get the idea. In all these instances, the ""someone"" is me. I don't know why he doesn't use the word ""you"" instead. By using the word ""someone"" it makes his comments feel distant, as if we are speaking about a 3rd person or some imaginative person or just people in general or anyone or that i am just one of many. When i speak, i purposely use ""you"" and me or i to make things more personal, to bring us closer together. 

What does this kind of ""someone"" language mean and how would someone (you 😝) interpret it? ",5,1743509582.0,emotionalintelligence,12,1.0,False
