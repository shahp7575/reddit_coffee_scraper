I was rushed to the emergency and within about an hour my vision came back slowly. I‚Äôm 30 years old no history of such a thing in our family my body weight/fat/muscle measurements are normal based on couple of smart scales.

I have been checked for:
- Measurement of Creatinine (Normal)
- ECG (Normal)
- Computerized Tomography of Brain (Normal)
- Spiral Angiography (My insurance won‚Äôt approve it yet)

Last thing I did before I lost my vision temporarily eating some chocolate and sweet with drinking coffee.

I‚Äôm smoker (Cigarettes, tobacco pipe, weed sometimes) I get stressed and worried occasionally and I was very depressed for a while but that was years ago, I mellowed some in last couple years but I get worried about work, health, relationship every now and then.

I don‚Äôt know what to expect or how to cope with this situation now any advice is appreciated. I met with two doctors one of them told me I have TIA and the second in bigger hospital waiting for me to do Spiral Angiography but I can‚Äôt pay for it for now I‚Äôm trying today again to get it approved by the insurance.

My partner and I are going to be in Italy mid November- mid December. We are flying into Naples. We had originally planned to spend some time in the Puglia area, but are leaning towards going full wintery vibes and heading north.

  
We don't have a big budget, 125-150 euro a day. We intend to travel slow. Stay in a place for a week or so, taking side quests and then basing somewhere else for a week or so, until our month is over. 

  
We considered taking a train from Naples to Bologna, renting a car there and exploring the Emilia Romagna region (Parma, Modena, Ravenna etc) 

  
Verona looks like maybe another good place for a base. We have heard good tings about the lakes ( Lago di Garda, Lago di Como)

  
But again we aren't the type staying in fancy hotels, more like a room in someones house thought aribnb or booking...

Also have heard good tings about the Turin area..

  
We would love to have access to some Christmas markets, and just lay low. We aren't really ""vacationing"" just want to stay places we can enjoy slow days, having some coffee, reading, visiting some small towns, and grabbing a bite out to eat here and there ( we are both big foodies, love to cook and eat new foods)

  
Any insight on these plans given the information I provided would be much appreciated!

  
Thanks

[U.S. Allies Unite for Critical Minerals Marketplace | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/US-Allies-Unite-for-Critical-Minerals-Marketplace.html)

https://preview.redd.it/zkglyrtm83xd1.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=a548ff9339a8182bf2d8d819d8762ccc9789fd9e

Earlier in the week, Reuters reported that the European Union has kicked off the process of choosing between eight bidders to create a 9-million-euro joint purchasing platform for critical minerals and energy. The bloc mooted the idea of pooling together buying orders in a bid to achieve more favorable deals and prices for critical minerals shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The EU aims to finalize a contract by the end of the year, following which it will develop sections of the platform for individual products early next year. Reuters did not clarify whether the United States will be involved in the new platform.

Well, it appears the United States is part of the critical minerals drive, after all. According to White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, the U.S. is working with allies to build a standardized international marketplace for metals and minerals in a bid to make the West less dependent on China.

‚Äò‚ÄòCritical minerals are another example. That sector is marked by extreme price volatility, widespread corruption, weak labor and environmental protections, and heavy concentration in the PRC, which artificially drops prices to keep competitors out of the marketplace. If we and our partners fail to invest, the PRC‚Äôs domination of these and other supply chains will only grow, and that will leave us increasingly dependent on a country that has demonstrated its willingness to weaponize such dependencies. We can‚Äôt accept that, and neither can our partners. That‚Äôs why we are working with them to create a high-standard, critical minerals marketplace, one that diversifies our supply chains, creates a level playing field for our producers, and promotes strong workers‚Äô rights and environmental protections. And we‚Äôre driving towards tangible progress on that idea in just the next few weeks,‚Äô‚Äô Sullivan told an audience at the American think tank Brookings Institution on Wednesday.

China accounted for 70% of world mine production of rare earths in 2022, with the U.S. importing nearly three-quarters of its rare earth supply from the Middle Kingdom. That leaves the country in a particularly precarious position, a point that was aptly driven home a couple of years ago at the height of tensions and trade wars between the two countries.

  
**Friendshoring Critical Minerals**

Luckily for the U.S and its Western allies, there‚Äôs a way out. The Nordic countries, particularly Greenland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, are rich in a variety of rare earth elements (REEs), and also have cobalt, nickel, lithium and graphite, and nickel reserves that remain largely unexploited. According to the Nordic Council of Ministers, the Nordic bedrock hosts over 43 million tons of economically viable deposits of rare earth minerals. Finland, Sweden, and Norway are among the top eight countries favorable for critical minerals and battery supply chain development, as per Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Further, Nordic governments have a history of commitment to low-impact, sustainable mining practices, making them ideal for industries looking for responsibly sourced minerals.

Even better, the U.S. and its allies have already laid the groundwork that will make future supply deals possible. In June 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and amid heightened tensions with China, the United States and its G7 partners launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) to build clean energy supply chains by friendshoring clean energy supply chains. The countries also signed the Minerals Security Partnership to produce, process, and recycle critical minerals. Subsequently, in January 2023, at Davos, Switzerland, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that a key pillar of the EU‚Äôs new industrial strategy will be global partnerships to access inputs needed for industry. This fresh drive builds on existing EU initiatives, including the European Battery Alliance and the Critical Raw Materials Act, both of which aim to onshore and secure supply chains.

These initiatives mark the emergence of a ‚Äújoint industrial policy‚Äù whereby the G7 states coordinate their industrial strategies at the international level and build supply chains collaboratively. This means these countries will be working together to secure supplies of needed technologies and create markets in support of net-zero industries in their home countries. Studies done by the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University have concluded that partnerships among democratic states would be able to produce enough minerals to enable the world to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the more ambitious target in the Paris Agreement. However, the same studies say that producing enough metals to meet these targets would require extraordinary technological and financial cooperation.

Both former President¬†[Donald Trump](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-10-05/pdf/2020-22064.pdf)¬†and Vice President¬†[Kamala Harris](https://mailchi.mp/kamalaharris.com/a-new-way-forward-to-build-american-industrial-strength-powered-by-american-workers)¬†support increasing US production of critical minerals. They have even expressed support for similar policies, such as mineral stockpiling. On day one of a new administration, the next US President can‚Äîunilaterally‚Äîtarget five policy areas to bolster US mining of critical minerals: stockpiling, subsidies, procurement, tariffs, and permitting.

* **Stockpiling.**¬†The¬†[Trump Administration](https://www.c-span.org/video/?476435-1/defense-department-supply-chain-readiness-integrity)¬†supported and the¬†[Harris campaign](https://mailchi.mp/kamalaharris.com/a-new-way-forward-to-build-american-industrial-strength-powered-by-american-workers)¬†supports increased mineral stockpiling. According to the Department of Defense, the National Defense Stockpile (NDS), as of March 2023, only had inventories to cover¬†[6 percent](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833)¬†of the US military‚Äôs and essential civilian demand‚Äôs estimated material shortfalls in a hypothetical one-year conflict with China, followed by a three-year recovery. The president could tap the¬†[NDS Transaction Fund](https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/097-4555)¬†for mineral stockpiling, as well as the¬†[Defense Production Act](https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/097-0360)¬†(DPA) fund. The Eisenhower Administration¬†[used](https://ahec.armywarcollege.edu/documents/Defense_Production_Act_1950-2020.pdf)¬†DPA funds for mineral stockpiling during the Cold War, and the president still has this authority ([50 USC ¬ß4533](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:50%2520section:4533%2520edition:prelim)#:~:text=4533%255D%252C%2520an%2520action%2520may%2520be,to%2520exceed%2520'%252485%252C000%252C000'.%2522)). Importantly, the next administration‚Äôs Department of Defense should¬†[prioritize](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/the-us-government-should-build-a-resilient-resource-reserve-for-wartime-and-peacetime/)¬†stockpiling minerals extracted and processed in the United States.

* **Subsidies.**¬†The Trump Administration¬†[supported](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/15/2020-29278/policies-and-procedures-for-loan-guarantees-for-projects-that-employ-innovative-technologies-and-for)¬†and the Harris campaign¬†[supports](https://mailchi.mp/kamalaharris.com/a-new-way-forward-to-build-american-industrial-strength-powered-by-american-workers)¬†subsidies for critical mineral projects. The Trump Administration¬†[deemed](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/15/2020-29278/policies-and-procedures-for-loan-guarantees-for-projects-that-employ-innovative-technologies-and-for)¬†critical mineral processing projects eligible for direct loans under the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) program, and the Biden-Harris Administration has¬†[loaned](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/critical-materials-projects)¬†to such projects. The next administration‚Äôs Department of Energy could also deem mining projects eligible under the ATVM program by issuing a draft rule that adds ‚Äúmining‚Äù to 10 CFR 611.2 ‚Äú[Eligible Project](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-10/part-611#p-611.2%2528Eligible%2520Project%2529)‚Äù (3). To specifically lower costs for US mineral processing facilities, the next administration‚Äôs Internal Revenue Service could propose new regulations extending the production costs covered by the¬†[Section 45X 10-percent production tax credit](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-27498/p-94)¬†to feedstock acquisition, as has been urged by¬†[several](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2023-0063-0191)¬†[organizations](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2023-0063-0133)¬†and¬†[mining](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2023-0063-0116)¬†[companies](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2023-0063-0011).

* **Procurement.**¬†Both the¬†[Trump](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/04/21/2017-08311/buy-american-and-hire-american)¬†and¬†[Biden-Harris](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/28/2021-02038/ensuring-the-future-is-made-in-all-of-america-by-all-of-americas-workers)¬†administrations support increased domestic content requirements for government procurement. Under the authority of¬†[Executive Order 14005](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/28/2021-02038/ensuring-the-future-is-made-in-all-of-america-by-all-of-americas-workers), the next administration‚Äôs Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council could issue a draft rule that adds a new part to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, requiring that acquisitions of specified clean energy technologies contain a certain threshold percentage of minerals extracted in the United States. For example, the draft rule could ultimately require that the¬†[General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/Thurs%2520215-315%2520-%2520Federal%2520Fleet%2520Management%2520Regulations%2520and%2520Policies%2520and%2520FAQs.pdf)‚Äîthe federal government‚Äôs main source for procuring non-tactical vehicles‚Äîonly acquire electric vehicles with batteries containing a high percentage of chemicals derived from US-extracted minerals. The next administration‚Äôs US Postal Service¬†[could](https://about.usps.com/manuals/spp/html/spp2_271.htm#ep883546)¬†adopt a similar content requirement in its¬†[Supplying Principles and Practices](https://about.usps.com/manuals/spp/html/spp2_271.htm#ep883546)¬†for electric vehicle acquisitions.

* **Tariffs.**¬†Trump has pledged¬†[significant](https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6334380407112)¬†[tariff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAg99owBB6w)¬†increases, while the Biden-Harris Administration¬†[increased](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Section%2520301%2520Modifications%2520Determination%2520FRN%2520(Sept%252012%25202024)%2520(FINAL).pdf)¬†tariffs on¬†[several minerals](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-14/us-tariffs-on-critical-minerals-leave-out-china-dominated-markets)¬†imported from China. Domestic mineral projects like¬†[South32](https://comments.ustr.gov/s/commentdetails?rid=T2KFWRPD73)‚Äôs Hermosa manganese-zinc project support such trade protections to reduce US reliance on foreign minerals. The next president could ([likely](https://www.csis.org/analysis/making-tariffs-great-again-does-president-trump-have-legal-authority-implement-new-tariffs)) impose tariffs on any mineral imports immediately under the¬†[International Emergency Economic Powers Act](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45618/8)¬†(IEEPA). The only prerequisite is a national emergency declaration, like the¬†[now-expired](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45618/8%2522%2520%255Ct%2520%2522_blank)¬†critical minerals¬†[executive order](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-22064/p-7). If concerned about the legality of levying tariffs under IEEPA, the president could also direct the secretary of commerce to open a¬†[Section 232 investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-14/us-tariffs-on-critical-minerals-leave-out-china-dominated-markets)¬†into mineral imports, although the tariff imposition would likely take several months to occur.

* **Permitting.**¬†Both¬†[Trump](https://x.com/GregWischer/status/1831812769894531551)¬†and¬†[Harris](https://mailchi.mp/kamalaharris.com/a-new-way-forward-to-build-american-industrial-strength-powered-by-american-workers)¬†support expedited permitting for building major projects. Previously, most US mining projects¬†[required](https://nma.org/category/water/)¬†Clean Water Act section 404 permits‚Äîwhich¬†[trigger](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-04/r9-rtoc-presentation-mining-issues-breakout-spring-2023.pdf)¬†the National Environmental Policy Act‚Äîbut the Supreme Court‚Äôs¬†[decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-454_4g15.pdf)¬†in¬†*Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency*¬†(2023)¬†[circumscribed](https://www.edf.org/media/new-edf-preliminary-analysis-estimates-millions-acres-wetlands-could-now-be-risk-wake-2023)¬†the areas requiring these permits, possibly lowering the permitting requirements for many mine projects. Determining whether a project requires a section 404 permit, however, can take¬†[up to one year](https://www.wetlands.com/update-on-corps-jd-delays/#:~:text=If%2520an%2520Approved%2520JD%2520%2528AJD,provide%2520an%2520initial%2520verbal%2520determination.)¬†based on the district. To expedite this process, the next administration‚Äôs US Army Corps of Engineers could issue a regulatory guidance letter directing district engineers to prioritize the review of approved jurisdictional determinations for sites of potential mining projects.

# In short, the next president‚Äôs administration has significant unilateral authority to support US mining of critical minerals.¬†First, it could increase mineral stockpiling by tapping both the NDS Transaction Fund and DPA fund for mineral acquisitions.

I‚Äôm using Jonathan Gagn√© recipe (9 min brew and 1 min press) and it yields a pretty nice cup of coffee.

My question (sorry it took so long to get here) is about grind size.

Aeromatic recommends 65 clicks on the K6 (and it‚Äôs catalogued as fine) but I find that I get a more balanced cup (a bit more vanilla and macadamia) when I go to 50-55 clicks.

The thing I‚Äôm not clear about is how the grinder actually works. Technically, it should increase the grind size by 16 microns for each click. That means that at 65 clicks (from true zero which in my case is -1) should give a grind size of 1040 microns which is more into the medium-coarse territory according to CoffeeChronicler website. 50 clicks would be 800 microns.

How accurate is the Aeromatic app when it comes to grind size recommendations and how do you usually dial in the grind size for different roast levels, especially with the K6 grinder?

Looking for some wisdom that goes deeper than RE experience. Need some life experience.","I‚Äôm looking for some wisdom that goes deeper than RE experience. Need some life and maybe spiritual experience. Quite long post/vent. 

  
TL/DR version: Love my home, barely use it since I'm always abroad, probably outgrew it, will I regret selling it and will I be able to afford a home five years from now?

I love my house. At the time of purchase, this was to be my forever, for a while, home. In late 2021, I actually packed my life in boxes, rented out my first home, and was ready to take a sabbatical. But, during the Holidays I was perusing Redfin and I fell in love with a home and after a showing I was sold. I felt that I could finally feel safe living alone in my home and neighborhood, and it is SO SO homey and cozy. My first home was in a dangerous neighborhood and I couldn‚Äôt get out of there fast enough.

Now, because I bought this home I decided to keep working and put my sabbatical on hold. Besides, I was working remotely and could travel to anywhere in the world and usually spend LESS since I visited LCOL countries.¬† But because of travel, my house is usually unoccupied. So after two years of travel I put it up for rent¬† and quit my job for good, or for a while at least. And as we know‚Ä¶..things always happen to houses, but I was willing to rent this home and deal with land lording hassles bc this is my ‚Äúforever‚Äù home. But now I‚Äôm starting to reconsider.¬†

Out of pure luck, I happen to be in the same city as my home when the latest call for help happened. I was only planning on being here for a couple of days and then move on to my next adventure but I am still here taking care of an undetectable water leak. At least this has proven to me that even when being in the area, this is always going to be a hassle. I‚Äôve gone through three professionals, two leak detectors, and a plumber‚Ä¶all ‚Äúhighly rated‚Äù in my area and all this shows me is that no one is dependable these days. I‚Äôm sticking to my usual method of posting on FB and finding a guy that does it all‚Ä¶seriously, they‚Äôve been my source for all of my work, except electric, and they‚Äôve always fixed my issues. But given this being my ‚Äúforever‚Äù home, figured I‚Äôd pay the price of the ‚Äúprofessionals.‚Äù Might as well have flushed the money down the drain, at least I would have moved on to the Jack of All trades quicker than two weeks of back and forth with incompetent people. I digress.¬†

Also- this is not my first rodeo as a landlord so don‚Äôt come at me with property management as an option. I‚Äôve dealt with them before and have never been satisfied. I just prefer to handle things my self. Which have mostly only been calls for toilet issues or clogged sink and I‚Äôve always handled this remotely. This has been the biggest issue so far of my four properties and I‚Äôm taking it very seriously since this home isn‚Äôt a business transaction. Due to my lifestyle I have sold two and have one (or two) more to go , so I‚Äôm definitely simplifying life. I hate being a landlord.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. Selling and buying this home was not at all a financial decision. This was purely emotional and I have 0 regrets. This was my safe space. But as I continue my sabbatical , and consider a potential permanent move abroad. I wonder if it‚Äôs even worth keeping this home. I figured that this would be where I would come back IF I return to the country. But IF I return, this place still has a few flaws.

At the ripe age of 34, and single during a lot of my solo time in that house, I felt isolated and lazy to go out to downtown. Driving 30 minutes isn‚Äôt much but sure makes it a hassle. When I lived in downtown during WFH, I had different habits. Going out to get coffee was more than just dumping money, it was a reason to get up and wash my face, get some steps in before meetings, breathe fresh air, socialize vs. working from home in the suburbs is rolling out of bed, connect to work calls, don‚Äôt shower till noon, be less productive because I don‚Äôt have a reason that demands I wrap up work by 5pm so I have all day to be ineffective. Basically, if I returned back, I would probably rent an apartment downtown. It really did make me more active. Only time I go out in the suburbs is to pickup my target run orders and grocery shop. Even after having my partner, I feel like being here didn‚Äôt let me live my fullest potential. Yet when we are in his downtown apartment, I‚Äôm thriving!

Then I consider keeping the house for family planning. Now that I‚Äôm going steady with someone, my current partner and I want to adopt in the next five years. Does owning a home make that process better? What if I sell and in five years we can‚Äôt afford a home in an A grade school zone. Do I even want to raise them in this country. This is a home where I‚Äôd happily have a baby and toddler, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want him/her to go to a school here. The highschool behind my home is doubling in size, our HOA neighborhood is already working on trying to prevent loitering. I‚Äôve also got news of rezoning to multifamily nearby. I‚Äôm worried about crime and degeneration of our neighborhood which is exactly wha tI experienced with my first home.¬†

Another con against the forever home is that HOA. It‚Äôs a lovely 26 home community tucked away and very well kept. My dues cover to maintain the grounds and I‚Äôve very happy with this. We keep an eye on each other but I keep thinking that our reserves are low and the later I sell this, the harder it is to get off my hands. It‚Äôs already getting a 40% increase and with COL, it‚Äôs only a matter of time for a special assessment. As owner occupied , I‚Äôd be happy to pay it, but not when I‚Äôm not living and benefitting from it. It‚Äôll make it tricky for someone getting approved for an HOA if it becomes so expensive .

If there was anything I‚Äôd change about my house it would be the kitchen. It‚Äôs a good size, but for a forever home, I‚Äôd want a big kitchen, and ideally gas. I‚Äôm honestly not inspired to cook in it, and that adds to that laziness in my life. I‚Äôve rented apartments with amazing kitchens and it makes meal prepping fun, it adds to a healthier and happier life style. Also‚Ä¶I have a lot of nightmares in my house and it has made me wonder if it‚Äôs not for me or if it‚Äôs just an isolated case. For a while I was stressed at my job and couldn‚Äôt sleep , but even after quitting I had the same issues, but I was stressed with preparing a duplex to sell and dealing with tenants that wouldn‚Äôt leave. So either it was stress or ‚Ä¶..the house? Tenants moved in right when I sold that duplex so no way to test the stress factor.

But, if we add the financial side of things to the equation. The house has a 3.25% rate, PITI+HOA is $2800, (413K mortgage left), and I ‚Äúown‚Äù a home when many people can‚Äôt imagine ever owning one. I‚Äôm in Seattle area and if I want to move to Bellevue, a great school zone, you need at leas 1.2 million. Here, with rent I break even, and I would have even considered renting it less for good tenants. Which, after entering the house months later, I realize I currently have them! The place is impeccable! But HOA is going up 40% and Taxes up 14%. But again, this is not a financial issue, this is a life decision . I guess a big financial concern for keeping it longer , in hope that maybe I‚Äôd go back, is that the worst case issues can happen‚Ä¶.winters are starting to be harsher and pipes bursting would set me back. Plus, even if I do return and want to purchase another home, HOA fees, taxes, etc can work against me if purchasing a new house since there isn‚Äôt a net positive on this.

Sometimes I I think I‚Äôd hold on to it because I have a bit of fear that another shot of homeownership may become unaffordable to me. I was at a peak work/salary wise which afforded me this house, and three others (thank you low interest rates). But I am no longer interested in selling my soul for a big salary. I value other things in life and if I was alone and single cat lady, I‚Äôd probably go work at Home Depot with a modest salary, chit chat to customers, clock-in and clock-out and be happy with what I have. What gives me less hope of a newer potential is that I started to look for work again and no longer are the days that recruiters call you, in fact I‚Äôve been ghosted. And I‚Äôm not even seriously looking. What if when I decide to buy another home it won‚Äôt be as easy, but then I think the next time I won‚Äôt have to do it alone and now WE can afford that great location for a future family. In a way I feel like my house still weighs me down with responsibilities I don‚Äôt need to give myself. While I‚Äôm childless I‚Äôd like to enjoy the little bit of freedom. I really hate having to tend to a tenant text. While minor, still a split second heart attack of the worst possible thinking.¬†

So, have I outgrown this house? Will I ever return?‚Ä¶I kind of feel like I‚Äôm weighing her (the house) down with this half-ass commitment from me when she can house a family who will cherish her. Every time I‚Äôve let go of something meaningful, like a favorite apartment, or my first home, my childhood city, it was hard, but I felt exponential growth after. Perhaps instead of thinking that I won‚Äôt hit a new peak, I need to move-on from this home so that I can climb those mountains again.¬†

When I look back at my favorite places I‚Äôve lived, I always think about my beloved downtown studio apartment in Seattle. The only reason I moved was when I purchased the duplex, but that studio apartment was the best. I felt like all my problems melted away when I got home. Just like my first car, a 93‚Äô Nissan Sentra with the automatic seatbelts- by far my favorite car. Sure, the last car I had was an SUV, far superior , functional, spacious, SAFER, but the Nissan still holds a place in my heart and maybe that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at with my home, just beautiful moments in life. Before things get messy and out of hand with a winter pipe burst or some other unthinkable mishap, which would make me resent this more‚Ä¶it‚Äôs time to move on. But if I come back, will I regret not having that home? Or should I expect myself to surpass this old version of myself and know that this was just another stepping stone.¬†

So, for those that are wiser, with more of lifestyle peaks and valleys, ebbs and flows, or if you‚Äôve moved on from a home like this, did it get better? Maybe not necessarily the home, but did life upgrade? Do I just cherish this home for having served me well in this phase in life and accept that we all have to move on?

Now this is largely to the great help that I've gotten on here that pointed me primarily towards Delta. I did eventually relaise that I don't really think I could be IEE though  so I decided to conitnue.

Now I did kinda come across EII which, if EII-Ne subtype does fit somewhat well and I do relate to Se-polr somewhat so I think that could be conclusion, however firstly I don't want to just \*assume\* and the more I read about Si, the more I relate to that as well.

So virtually what I'd like to do is check whether I indeed could be a Si-activating type or whether I've just been Si-base all along. Potentialy others but I really don't think there's much to consider besides these.

Now firstly, to kind of eliminate Beta and Gamma, this may not necesarily eliminate if I'm wrong in my assumptions but basically what I'm going to do is describe how I experience Se to see how strong (or rather weak it is)I wanna stress these are just assumptions and I'm ok with being corrected if I'm wrong.

So on **Se**

\-I am really bad with force, I cathegorically am uncomfortable with forcing my will upon people, I could never force someone to act against their will (in any normal situation) and I am even uncomfortable with just **convincing** people, I want to respect their values and see them come to their own conclusions

\-While I'm very aware of boundaries of others, I may struggle clearly maintaining my own personal boundaries, I can try but it's very stresfull, difficult and uncomfortable and I'm scared off coming as too mean.

\-I very strongly dislike conflict, especially unresolved tension is something I try to avoid, I'm also bad at it, I don't think I'd be able to effectively intimdate people nor do I try. I can yell sure sometimes, even come off as bit commanding but I don't like it.

\-On the other hand I see power as interesting, I've always somewhat had keen relationship to characters that pursue power and identified with them but I don't think I acutally would want any real power, any serious power. I also dislike people who act autoritatively towards me, I want to pursue my own path. And not rely on pressure from others.

\-I feel kinda detached from physical world, I'm always ""in my head"", I'm also prone to bump into things while walking.

  
On Si

\-I'd say I'm a seeker of comfort, I like looking at and thinking about enviroments that give me sense of comfort, I like to engage in certain comfortable activities like bathing and drinking coffee, smoking cigars or other pleasant sensations like that. I think about comfort like REALLY often.

\-I dislike leaving my comfort zone, truthfully part of this is because I want an enviroment where I can be ""in my head"" in peace but also partially because I do value comfort of home and stuff like travelling is logistically annoying and also pulls me from my envrioment and conviniences. I also often reflect on stuff whethre I will be home on time to still catch hot bathwater.

\-I'd say I'm pretty lazy, I conserve energy, cut corners, take shortcuts and try to put minimom effort into stuff like uni projects or whatnot. I'm also not a planner, I only see vague outline of future but otherwise I flow through things and I don't care to ""predict"" the future as a Ni-base type would.

1gcjc07,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Zdigitalkeys/comments/1gcjc07/lemon_thumbprint_cookies_recipe/,Lemon Thumbprint Cookies Recipe,"**Lemon Thumbprint Cookies**¬†are a wonderful twist on the classic thumbprint cookie. Featuring a buttery, crumbly cookie base and a refreshing lemon curd filling, they‚Äôre a perfect treat for anyone who loves the bright, tangy flavor of citrus. These cookies are easy to make and visually appealing, making them ideal for special occasions, holiday gatherings, or an everyday sweet treat.

In this article, we‚Äôll guide you through the recipe for Lemon Thumbprint Cookies, along with tips for making them extra delicious!

**Why You‚Äôll Love Lemon Thumbprint Cookies**

Lemon Thumbprint Cookies are as delicious as they are beautiful. The tender, buttery cookie contrasts with the zingy lemon filling, creating a treat that‚Äôs sweet, tart, and melts in your mouth. Plus, they‚Äôre easy to customize by adjusting the level of lemon flavor or adding a touch of icing for extra sweetness. Perfect for gifting or serving at a gathering, these cookies are sure to impress.

**Ingredients for Lemon Thumbprint Cookies**

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:

**For the Cookie Dough:**

* **1 cup unsalted butter**¬†(softened)
* **1/2 cup granulated sugar**
* **1 large egg yolk**
* **1 teaspoon vanilla extract**
* **2 cups all-purpose flour**
* **1/4 teaspoon salt**

**For the Lemon Filling:**

* **1/2 cup lemon curd**¬†(store-bought or homemade)
* **Powdered sugar**¬†(for dusting, optional)

**Step-by-Step Recipe for Lemon Thumbprint Cookies**

**Step 1: Prepare the Dough**

1. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2‚Äì3 minutes.
2. Add the egg yolk and vanilla extract, mixing until fully combined.
3. Gradually add the flour and salt, mixing until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, you can chill it in the refrigerator for 10‚Äì15 minutes to make it easier to handle.

**Step 2: Shape the Cookies**

1. Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and place them about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Use your thumb or the back of a spoon to gently press down in the center of each dough ball, creating an indentation for the lemon filling.

**Step 3: Add the Lemon Filling and Bake**

1. Spoon a small amount of lemon curd (about 1/2 teaspoon) into the center of each cookie.
2. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10‚Äì12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.
3. Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

**Tips for Making the Best Lemon Thumbprint Cookies**

1. **Chill the dough:**¬†If the dough is sticky, chilling it will make it easier to handle and prevent the cookies from spreading too much during baking.
2. **Use homemade lemon curd for a fresher flavor:**¬†Store-bought lemon curd works well, but homemade lemon curd adds a fresher, more intense lemon flavor.
3. **Don‚Äôt overfill:**¬†Be careful not to overfill the cookie indentations, as the lemon curd may bubble over the edges during baking.
4. **Dust with powdered sugar:**¬†For a beautiful finishing touch, lightly dust the cookies with powdered sugar once they‚Äôve cooled.

**Why This Recipe Works**

The buttery, crumbly base of the cookie provides a perfect contrast to the creamy, tangy lemon curd, creating a balance of flavors that‚Äôs both sweet and tart. The thumbprint technique ensures that each cookie has just the right amount of filling, making every bite a delightful mix of textures and flavors.

**Serving Suggestions for Lemon Thumbprint Cookies**

* **Pair with tea or coffee:**¬†These cookies are a great accompaniment to a cup of tea or coffee.
* **Gift them:**¬†Place a few in a decorative box or tin for a thoughtful homemade gift.
* **Add a drizzle of icing:**¬†For a touch of extra sweetness, drizzle a simple powdered sugar glaze over the cookies once they‚Äôve cooled.

**Conclusion**

**Lemon Thumbprint Cookies**¬†are a bright and cheerful treat that combines the tanginess of lemon with the richness of a buttery cookie. They‚Äôre easy to make, beautifully presentable, and perfect for any occasion. Whether you‚Äôre a citrus lover or just looking for a new cookie recipe to try, these Lemon Thumbprint Cookies are sure to become a favorite

It's a 25min drive. I left to late and got there 10 minutes late. When I rang the doorbell she my ex opens the door and hands me a bag of items. My kid was already dressed to leave. 

My kid wanted to show me something inside the house but my ex stood in the door opening signaling to me that I can't enter. Usually we have a little chat or a cup of coffee. 

I tell my ex that if she's in such a rush that its a better idea that she should bring our kid to me. That way she is in control on being on time and I don't get rushed because she is in one.

This leads to an argument where we both raise our voice and are generally not our best selves. This all happening at the door entrance because she did not want me to enter.

After a while I pull the cord and walk past her pick up my kid and leave. As I do this I commented that we are not welcome here and should leave.

The rest of the morning I get furious text messages that I can't say that to a child. AITA here?

1gcj8vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bashar_Essassani/comments/1gcj8vq/continuing_the_momentum_of_shifting_to_a_high/,ü•≥üöÄContinuing the Momentum of Shifting to a High Vibratory TimelineüéÅüéâ,"I‚Äôve seen over the past few weeks many concerned about B‚Äôs recent prediction/energy-sensing. Well one thing he stressed over and over is we must take responsibility for the information. Taking responsibility = taking our ability to respond. Also, no matter how you feel about it, it‚Äôs good to feel something, because that means you‚Äôre alive and thinking!

Here are some constructive ways we can use the information to our collective benefit, and pass the threshold of Earth becoming open to the greater world around it. Here‚Äôs what we can do from now until Nov 8^(th)/mid-November, to attract resonant events that will continue us being on the healthy, happy, vibrating reality train B's been talking about for years now, and in recent months has been giving direct steps!

**\* Do a mild dietary cleanse / Eat cleaner!** The human body is the window to which your soul experiences physical reality, and attracts and repulses experiences and events. The happiest, highest vibratory you is a brain state and bodily state, so it‚Äôs time to clean house. I recommend the Medical Medium information for proper techniques. I don‚Äôt agree with everything he says, but he‚Äôs by far the best I‚Äôve seen and have tried/experienced personally.

**\* Do a mild mental-emotional cleanse!** Focus solely on what needs your attention in your life, letting distractions not get the focus until mid-November. I say focus on what needs your attention, because people have responsibilities and life-challenges they have yet to face, which leads to the next thing below.

**\* Let go of any kind of lower vibratory addictions until mid-November!** Be it coffee, chocolate, wine, weed, violent video games, debasing pornography, junk food, political content designed to enrage, or conspiracies designed to fill your subconscious with fear-based thoughts and esoteric arrogance (hence disrespectful terms like NPC/sheep/etc.). Take a break until mid-November. It‚Äôs not going anywhere, and the Universe has been calling you to take a break. The reason Bashar said let go of conspiracies is because they‚Äôre campfire stories designed to engender fear, regardless if true or false, and are permission slips designed for you to forget that you‚Äôre a powerful aspect of God. For clarity: Addiction means forming a habit, compulsive behavior, or lifestyle around something. You know you: write/type a list of different things you do you KNOW are unhealthy or are not frequency raising, and consciously choose to not choose them for a while. Angst/anxiety/dread should subside a bit if you truly acknowledge they aren‚Äôt going anywhere--they'll still be around after mid-November.

**\* Laugh more; make someone else laugh!** Right now I‚Äôve seen some stuff from Josh Johnson, who has a knack for current events. Check out some comedians.

**\* Donate food and unused clothes to local charities or soup kitchens, or work at one in your free time!** This is really marking your timeline‚Äôs vibratory territory and making a difference helping others. Do it just once if you can!

**\* Give random people a compliment!** This will make a person‚Äôs day! One example is a woman who might feel insecure about aging. Any age/race/gender, though. If the person has blemishes or is handicapped, tell them something they‚Äôre wearing looks nice (It may have a reverse effect telling them they look nice; they might not believe you.). Really it‚Äôs about going around and genuinely telling people genuinely nice things. You can do this online or off! (The comment section of some vlogger, IG comments (not thirsty), etc.)

**\* Do someone a favor!** Do that positive thing for yourself or others you‚Äôve been meaning to do! Clean that room, literally and or poetically!

**\* Bashar said vote for the female (maybe convince others to do the same)!** Bashar said it in a way to protect Darryl from unhinged people, wherein they could still do mental gymnastics and not emotionally combust hearing something so unexpectedly outside their personal belief-system. Blue is a higher vibration than red, and it‚Äôs no coincidence it‚Äôs also the Sassani frequency as well--voting blue, is voting Blue. (Mod Censorship Clause: I understand shutting down political dialogue into one thread because it isn‚Äôt always constructive. This post isn‚Äôt just politics though, and is too long for people to see in the designated thread.

**\* Let whatever will happen, happen.** Make a genuine attempt at raising your vibe and others‚Äô, and move on! As B would say, raise your manifestation energy up through feelings, thoughts, and actions, and let it go reflect back into your reality mirror.

**\* Smile and/or act silly for no reason!** It‚Äôs an instant Hz raiser!

**You don‚Äôt have to do‚Äôem all, but one is better than none!**

Let‚Äôs See What Happens!

Sometimes stopping for a little moment and giving space to your world can be definitely rewarding.

Relaxation is needed for working this human body

When we give time for ourselves and do different things, we learn many things.

It can be either a short coffee break or taking deep breaths, but they definitely give us some relaxing moments.

Life without happiness look meaningless

We can think about many things for future past or we can work how hard we want for future, but you are always here and now, it means this moment is all you have.

You can do whatever you want but giving yourself happiness hours right time is necessary.

Afterall you can still work for future while living in present, actually we live in present every moment however where your mind is only you know.

know your strengths and weaknesses is good for what you want to do

Actions are necessary for everything; it can be said world is like this because of change although its can be automatic or taken by thinking but they are fundamental for any living.

We humans who have given ourselves title of THE THINKER believe that we take most of actions by choices then taking right choice becomes very important for human survival.

so, give yourself little time, it will teach you everything and also will take you everywhere.

In last I will say things are temporary, try to recover from sadness and be present in happiness fully.

In the long run though, I feel like it'd probably be a little more economical if I had a reliable workhorse bean that I could confidently buy a kilo at a time for work brews, and save fancier and more exotic single origin stuff for savouring at home.

Due to the seasonal nature of coffee I feel like a blend is probably the answer here. Obviously seasonal blends will change throughout the year, but is there a roaster who's house filter blend just never misses? To the point where blind buying a kilo at any time of the year isn't a worry. Bonus points for affordability, but bargain bin pricing isn't a necessity, I've got no issue with paying a little more for quality coffee.

Saturday, a unique day in the week, offers a perfect opportunity to pause, reflect on the past, and set your sights on the future. It's not just a catch-up day; it's a golden chance to realign and recharge.¬†



Creating a routine around your Saturday means you're not just reflecting on the past week. You're also setting the tone for the new week, ensuring you step into it with a clear plan and renewed energy.



Here are three powerful ways to build a Saturday routine that empowers you to move forward:



1. Reflect on Wins and Challenges ‚Äì Take time in the morning or over coffee to celebrate your wins from the past week, no matter how small. Note any challenges that slowed you down or where you could improve. Embracing wins and knowing any challenges sets a foundation of awareness for the coming week.



2. Set Clear Intentions ‚Äì You can define what you want your next week to look like. What are your top priorities? How can you keep those priorities front and center? Make a list or jot down a few intentions to guide your focus. This is your week, and you are in control.



3. Plan Restorative Time‚ÄîSaturdays aren't just about work. They're about you. Plan time to recharge‚Äîwith family, a good book, or a hobby you love. This balance can fuel your motivation and energy for the week ahead. You are important, and taking time for yourself is not a luxury but a necessity.

That it doesn't mean anything about the connection or friendship. Has anyone been through this situation before? I'm finding it hard to cope. :(

We have our fights here and there throughout the years but this year was the breaking point. We fought for almost a month, breaking up, got back together and repeat. The breaking point is because of my issues. I have the habit of lying and hiding things from my bf, and it doesn‚Äôt need to be a big issue, i.e. if I bought a coffee from a cafe during working hours, I didn‚Äôt tell him. I just stayed quiet. And I knew he does not like liars. But during the fight I keep lying, twisting stories to benefit myself.

However, finally due to sheer belief that we are meant for each other, we‚Äôve agreed that we should buck up and start bettering ourselves for the future of our relationship. It was going great, we are more transparent and honest with each other. Communicating our feelings more and listening to each other better. But that will be 1-2 weeks and there will be another fight cause when he ask me about the past I will start lying again. This has been going on for almost 3 months.

I have addressed my issues to my therapist and trying to be better, my issues on my inability to communicate properly, lying and keeps hiding everything from my bf so that I wouldn‚Äôt get scolded is something I am actively working on.

Nevertheless, I am still struggling and when he asks again about the fight, i‚Äôll get frantic and i‚Äôll get back to my patterns, and honestly right now everything is all jumbled up. I mean I want to come clean about it and tell him everything but honestly some of it I really don‚Äôt remember. I remember little little things of the past and when he ask i will just spew up parts of it and it differs most of the times and it frustrates him. I know he‚Äôs expecting me to tell everything but realistically how. So people of reddit, I would like to seek everyone‚Äôs opinion on what would you do if you are in my situation?

However, three days before the date, he ghosted me. I reached out to check if we were still on, and to my surprise, he said something came up and he couldn‚Äôt go anymore, but he offered to reschedule. I decided not to accept the reschedule because I wanted to talk to him first, given that he mentioned it was an emergency.

Since then, he hasn‚Äôt responded to my messages at all, and I‚Äôm feeling a bit confused about what to do next. Should I try reaching out one more time, or is it better to just move on? I‚Äôm not sure if I should read too much into this or if it‚Äôs a sign that he‚Äôs not really interested.

So, I'm not only extremely busy with everyday life including kids, but I'm also ADHD as hell. 

So after completing a room, I often have something to do or I want to take a break for a second, and in every other room and in every other circumstance this is fine and I can just walk away from the computer after clearing a room to feed kids, get a drink, or move a cat off my desk.

I forget about nemesis having the ability to remove room choices and she almost always goes for the room that is the most beneficial like a dual Boon Room, and if I don't remember to quickly pause, I'll end up just getting a gold Room instead and it's incredibly frustrating and dissuades me from continuing the run, because it's taunting me over memory issues I can't control.

What's worse is that it feels like a problem most other people that are going to get on this game don't have because they don't have real life stepping in or ADHD and memory problems making them forget to pause the game and so people who are able to just continue playing one room after another are going to rush towards the duo room first, and it makes me feel a little mentally broken and lesser for not remembering things or that im being punished for having a real life that distracts me. 

It started out as a cute and small annoyance that I didn't think would ever bother me but after the 200th time of knowing that I could have gotten something better if I had just remembered to pause because she busts through the door like kool-aid man and buries the entrance, or if I didn't have to get up to do laundry, my run would be better.

I don't even think I would care as much if it wasn't for that the game taunts you for it. It lets you know this hypothetical that you're going to be missing out on with no way to just restart the room. At least when they do it at the shop I have to make the active choice to run in and grab an item before they do, and I can remember it because I'm making the active choice to go into a shop prepared to see them.

I understand that this could be solved by just me remembering to press the pause button, but having people tell you to just remember something doesn't really work like that and suddenly fix your memory problems

I understand that most people aren't going to have these struggles and it's not necessarily reasonable for me to make a request to change a game mechanic because of my own personal flaws and failures, but this one mechanic has happened so often to me that I don't like coming back to the game, and it could be fixed by just allowing us to redo a room or have her fuck off into the sky like heracles.

I now absolutely despise Nemesis and wish I could throw cold coffee on her. thank you for coming to my self-loathing inducing TED Talk.",0,1729941515.0,Hades2,3,0.5,False

These figurines are fully customizable, allowing you to capture the likeness and personality of the recipient, making them feel extra special.

**2. Experience-Based Gifts for a Memorable Celebration**

Another great idea for a thoughtful gift is to provide an experience instead of a physical item. Experience-based gifts can create lasting memories that stay in the heart forever. For birthdays, you could arrange a surprise hot air balloon ride, a gourmet cooking class, or a relaxing spa day. These experiences can add a sense of adventure or relaxation to the celebration, depending on the recipient's preferences.

**3. Personalized Keepsakes: Cherish the Moments**

Custom keepsakes are always a hit when it comes to meaningful gifts. From engraved jewelry to personalized photo albums, these keepsakes can hold special significance for both the giver and the recipient. For anniversaries, a customized star map showing the night sky on the date of their wedding or the day they met can be a beautiful reminder of a special moment.

Custom Bobbleheads are also great personalized keepsakes that are sure to put a smile on the recipient's face.

Another popular keepsake idea is a personalized wooden plaque or a photo frame with a heartfelt message. You could also consider giving a scrapbook filled with cherished memories, such as photos, notes, and souvenirs that mark your journey together. Personalized gifts like these help preserve beautiful memories and remind the recipient of the special bond you share.

**4. Subscription Boxes: The Gift That Keeps On Giving**

Subscription boxes have become increasingly popular as gifts, and for a good reason‚Äîthey keep on giving!

In this digital age, the value of a handwritten letter is often overlooked. Taking the time to write a heartfelt letter can be one of the most meaningful gifts you can give. It‚Äôs personal, emotional, and can convey your feelings in a way that no store-bought gift can.

Write about your favorite memories with the recipient, what you love most about them, and how they‚Äôve impacted your life. You can even pair the letter with a small, symbolic gift to make it extra special. This gesture will show the recipient that you genuinely care, and they‚Äôll appreciate the effort and thought you put into it.

Such gifts are timeless, and their emotional significance makes them incredibly special.

**7. Customized Jewelry: A Classic and Elegant Choice**

I (27F) have been with my bf (29M) for 6 years. We have our fights here and there throughout the years but this year was the breaking point. We fought for almost a month, breaking up, got back together and repeat. The breaking point is because of my issues. I have the habit of lying and hiding things from my bf, and it doesn‚Äôt need to be a big issue, i.e. if I bought a coffee from a cafe during working hours, I didn‚Äôt tell him. I just stayed quiet. And I knew he doesn‚Äôt not like liars. But during the fight I keep lying, twisting stories to benefit myself.

However, finally due to sheer belief that we are meant for each other, we‚Äôve agreed that we should buck up and start bettering ourselves for the future of our relationship. It was going great, we are more transparent and honest with each other. Communicating our feelings more and listening to each other better. But that will be 1-2 weeks and there will be another fight cause when he ask me about the past I will start lying again. This has been going on for almost 3 months.

I have addressed my issues to my therapist and trying to be better, my issues on my inability to communicate properly, lying and keeps hiding everything from my bf so that I wouldn‚Äôt get scolded is something I am actively working on.

Nevertheless, I am still struggling and when he asks again about the fight, i‚Äôll get frantic and i‚Äôll get back to my patterns, and honestly right now everything is all jumbled up. I mean I want to come clean about it and tell him everything but honestly some of it I really don‚Äôt remember. I remember little little things of the past and when he ask i will just spew up parts of it and it frustrates him. I know he‚Äôs expecting me to tell everything but realistically how. So people of reddit, I would like to seek everyone‚Äôs opinion on what would you do if you are in my situation? 

TL;DR: My bf and I are trying to save the relationship by bettering ourselves but we keep going back to our old patterns. ",0,1729940801.0,relationships,5,0.25,False

We had our share of ups and downs‚Äîsmall fights that were always followed by passionate reconciliations. Music became our language; we'd share songs, creating a playlist that seemed to narrate our unfolding story. I‚Äôd introduce her to my favorites, and she‚Äôd listen, truly listen, like the lyrics were secrets I had written just for her.

One evening, while listening to music, she suddenly asked, ""If I danced with other guys, would you be jealous?""

I felt my chest tighten for a moment. ""Yes,"" I admitted, ""seeing you have a good time without me would make me jealous."" But then, with a playful grin, I started singing Rihanna's part from ""We Found Love""‚Äî*""Everybody‚Äôs watching her, but she's looking at you, you, you...""*

She burst out laughing, her eyes wide in surprise. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked, as if I had just said something profound. I played the song for her, and we sang along, our voices mixing with the music, filling the room with a kind of warmth I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time. The way she looked at me after, as if I‚Äôd done something amazing just by being there, made my heart race.

Another time, she asked me, ""Am I the perfect girl for you?""

I just smiled, a little too scared to dive into those emotions just yet. ""You should listen to Linkin Park,"" I replied, deflecting with humor as usual.

That weekend, I went home, but even when we were apart, we stayed close. She‚Äôd call every night, checking in as if my absence left an empty space only she could fill. One evening, she called me on Teams, her voice sounding small. ""I‚Äôm all alone here,"" she complained. ""If you really liked me, you wouldn‚Äôt have left me in the office by myself.""

I laughed softly and replied, ""You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy..."" I trailed off, sending her the link to Johnny Cash's cover of ""You Are My Sunshine."" She listened quietly, and when she called back, I could hear the emotion in her voice.

""No one ever recommends songs for me,"" she said softly. ""You...you‚Äôre my sunshine too.""

We declared the song ours, but it wasn‚Äôt exactly a happy one. It spoke of longing and the fear of loss, of sunshine slipping away. She didn‚Äôt argue when I pointed that out, but when she called me by my nickname and said her pet name would always need mine, it was as if she was giving me permission to hold on to something more. Something just between us.

The Bangalore team was planning a visit to our office, and Riya was busy organizing everything. There was a lot to be done, and amidst all that, we grew closer in ways I hadn‚Äôt anticipated.

One morning, I surprised her at the railway station. I‚Äôd woken up early and left for the office with a friend, knowing her train would arrive around 10 AM. I sat near a bench, planning how I‚Äôd greet her‚Äîcoffee in hand, maybe a witty line or two. But when the train arrived and people started flooding out, she walked right past me without even noticing. I called her name and she turned, startled. ""What are you doing here?"" she asked, a smile breaking out on her face.

""I just really like the coffee here,"" I joked.

She rolled her eyes, but the look she gave me was filled with warmth, a mix of happiness and something else‚Äîa quiet relief, as if she was glad I was there without really knowing why.

Later that day, we went scouting for accommodation for the Bangalore team. On the way back, she hugged me suddenly, pressing her face into my shoulder. I felt her lips graze my skin in a gentle kiss. My breath caught in my throat; it was the kind of gesture that spoke volumes without a single word. I didn‚Äôt know what to say, but I didn‚Äôt need to‚Äîher touch said it all.

The team arrived, and we greeted them together. It didn‚Äôt take long for Riya to grow jealous of Ramya, a friendly colleague who worked closely with me. Her smile would fade whenever Ramya laughed at one of my jokes, and she‚Äôd shoot daggers at her with every glance. She had a sharp edge to her words whenever Ramya was around, but I couldn‚Äôt blame her‚Äîpart of me liked that she cared enough to get possessive.

The next day, we went on a trek. Halfway up the trail, Riya turned to me and said, ""Hop on my back!""

I laughed, thinking she was joking, but then she crouched down, insisting. ""It‚Äôs been a dream of mine,"" she said, half-serious. I climbed onto her back, both of us laughing as we stumbled up the rocky path. It was ridiculous, but I loved that about her‚Äîhow we could be silly together without caring what anyone thought. We reached a waterfall and swam with the others, the water rushing over us like time itself had stopped for just that moment.

On the way back, I noticed her mood had shifted. She left quickly, and during the car ride, I could tell something was bothering her. She was distant, but not for long. Later, as we sat around the villa we‚Äôd rented for the night, she drank quickly, as if trying to wash something away. When we were deciding on who would ride with whom, she chose to hop on Gokul's bike instead of joining us in the car.

At dinner, we ended up sitting far apart. She was being friendly with Tamilarasan from the Bangalore team, and I could feel my chest tighten as he kept flirting with her. But every so often, our eyes would meet across the table, and it was like we were the only two people in the room. The whole evening was a game of silent confessions, a battle neither of us wanted to fight.

After dinner, Sruthi asked me what kind of girl I was interested in. I didn‚Äôt hesitate. ""Riya,"" I said simply. ""She‚Äôs the one.""

I didn‚Äôt know she had been standing nearby, just out of earshot. As Sruthi walked away, Riya and I fell into step beside each other. We were both tipsy, and I cracked a few jokes as we wandered down a path overlooking the cliff, hand in hand, our laughter echoing under the starlit sky. She asked me to carry her again, this time wrapping her arms around my neck as I lifted her with ease. We walked for a bit, her feet dangling as I took one step after another, drunk on more than just alcohol.

""You‚Äôre crazy, you know,"" she said as we reached the beach. ""No one would dare let me do that. My fianc√© always says I‚Äôd break his back.""

I chuckled, still catching my breath. ""Good thing I‚Äôm strong enough to carry an elephant.""

She smacked me playfully on the head. ""Are you calling me an elephant?""

We laughed, our voices mingling with the sound of the waves. The night wrapped around us like a blanket as we stood on the sand, our hands intertwined. She finally opened up about why she had been so moody. Her fianc√©, stuck in a different state, had made a big fuss about her going on this trip. He didn‚Äôt want her to enjoy herself while he was stuck alone, and he had even used her father to guilt her into staying home.

""He‚Äôs been like that ever since I started working,"" she said, her voice breaking slightly. ""It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm about to marry my father. One jailor to another.""

I let out a quiet laugh, ""Daddy issues, huh?"" She smacked my head again, but there was no malice in it‚Äîjust a shared sadness that we were trying to turn into something lighter.

As we sat on the beach, her head resting on my shoulder, I felt the warmth of her body seeping into mine. It didn‚Äôt matter that the wind was chilly or that the world around us seemed vast and indifferent. For that moment, she was mine, and I was hers, even if neither of us could fully say it. The night, with its secrets and stars, belonged to us alone.",2,1729940569.0,PrakashamParakkatte,0,1.0,False

1gciivv,https://www.reddit.com/r/QantasFrequentFlyer/comments/1gciivv/how_i_will_utilise_points_clubplus_and_domestic/,How I will utilise points club/plus and domestic business class to get to Qantas Gold (eventually),"Just wanted to make this post to give people some idea on how to get to gold status if you don't fly all the time or want gold to be able to have a year of more frequent flying with a bit of comfort in the future. 

This is my first time chasing points, and status. I don't know if it is all worth it but it has just been something for me to focus on so I don't burn out with my job while trying to hit those big life goals of savings, investing, home ownership etc. 

I'll just say here I probably have spent more than I would of if I never got a credit card. This is my nature generally when I have access to credit. Its easy to get a bit carried away with everyday rewards bonus points, sometimes the pays are just not good enough.

I don't find a lot of value in the program except for the 10x reward points eftpos gift card offers (bought with a points earning CC) to pay for dental, optical or other health bills and the occasional time when they stuff up and send an abusable booster on a product I'd buy every week anyway.  

my breakdown this year is as follows

**Cards and Banking** 180682 (155000 bonus points)

**others** 3550 

**health and leisure** 580

**flights** 3455

**food and wine** 129420 (44000 everyday rewards conversion, 85420 Qantas wine)

**Fuel and cars** 1214

**Shopping** 500

**Insurance quotes** 250

total **319651 points**

So I got points club pretty early on, and I used this to help plan flights that I would actually enjoy to see family in Brisbane and Melbourne 

I've flown 7 times total so far and collected 153 SC, 103 from flights and 50 for green tier

My favourite status run is Rockhampton to Brisbane, then Brisbane to Rockhampton, but it returns via Cairns.

This combo can be booked for $290 for 32 status credits. 

A classic reward Rocky to Brisbane 8000 points $58 7SC with points club

Brisbane to Rocky via Cairns is two flights 15 SC and 10SC this can be found for $231. 

I have accommodation in Brisbane which I take with family or book Qantas hotels if I want to be in the city or collect points.

The rest of the year I have 9 more flights the breakdown is one status run (3 flights) and a trip BNE to HK and the connecting flights for that (6 flights). 

**This will take me to points club plus and silver this membership year. So I will have QC membership until 28 Feb 2026.**

So with the DSC promotion I have booked the same status runs for 2025 but changed it so that the trip needs just one nights accommodation in Cairns.

**The Gold status run I settled on is** 

Rocky to BNE on Saturday morning first flight 18400 (+$58 taxes) points for business class classic reward 18SC

BNE to Cairns on the same day E190 business class cash fare $499-608 for 60SC

Cairns to Rocky milk run on the Sunday for 8000 (+$58 taxes) points 7SC

**85SC, for $615-724, Doubled to 170 SC with the DSC promotion.**

$102 for a cheap hotel on Qantas Hotels for bonus points to use on more classic rewards.

**Three trips (9 flights) nets me 510 SC, so with points club plus, 100 SC roll over in membership year 2025, loyalty bonus 50 SC and green tier 50 SC I can achieve gold in membership year 2025 to have until 28 Feb 2027.**

**total spend to attain gold in membership year 2025 $2369** (points and accommodation)

Its a long game, and still needs a fair whack of spending up front to achieve points club plus but with the spending being related to your life in general (booze, cost of living, repairs and maintenance etc) its easier to stomach for me than dropping 6k - 8k on business class flights.

**Final thoughts**

I'll probably get Qantas'd on the runs.

Its not as stressful as flying internationally.

Coffee at your destination is guaranteed to be good because us Aussies are keen for it.

A cancelled flight just means a sickie and time in the lounge before the rebooked flight. 

The Qantas wine, buy wine to get points to fly classic rewards to drink more wine.

Worth chasing points club plus only if you know your already going to have a very expensive year that you can capitalise on with CC signups for bonus points offers.

I always get addressed normally and people say she 

Before in the beginning of my detransition i confused people with the contrast between my voice and face

But now i‚Äôve been practicing and working on my voice (not legit exercised lmao just speaking softer and trying to emulate my old voice and eventually it started to feel natural)

However today a barista i like asked for my pronouns. Normally this never happens but idk‚Ä¶ i‚Äôve been really friendly with her since i go to the coffee shop all the time

But it kinda stung‚Ä¶ i haven‚Äôt been asked that question in a while and everywhere i go people say she when they talk about me and call me miss or ma‚Äôam

And then this barista asks me what my pronouns are..

I started thinking negative thoughts like do i look like a boy? Is my voice still weird? Maybe when i talked to her my voice was rough? I dont sound like the average girl but more like shane from L word

If nor raspier idk i can‚Äôt tell

And i just felt awful.. maybe it‚Äôs the way i dress cause i‚Äôm still a tomboy 

Maybe it‚Äôs cause i hate showing skin so people never see my outline in my baggy clothes so its even more confusing

My hair is longer and that helped but

After this mornings pronoun business i feel kinda sad and mannish

I kept wondering to myself if she asked others the same question or if she only asked those who ‚Äúlook or sound trans‚Äù
or smth

Maybe it‚Äôs a polite thing to do in western countries (i‚Äôm not from here just came to get a degree)

Maybe .. i hope it‚Äôs a polite language thing 

The barista herself looked a little alternative or androgynous and i always thought that was cool

Maybe thats why? She could have a different gender id and in turn seeks that out in others just in case she doesn‚Äôt get the pronouns right? I dunno

I‚Äôm flipping between tryna rationalize it and overthinking it and i feel like an ugly loser lmao

1gcii18,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrakashamParakkatte/comments/1gcii18/chapter_1_the_beginning_of_everything/,Chapter 1: The Beginning of Everything,"It had been a year since I started working at this company. Our small team was close-knit: Andy, Neil, Allie, Victor, and me, David. We were a tight group, almost like family, thrown together by the peculiar circumstances of the COVID era. With no supervisors breathing down our necks, we found our rhythm‚Äîbalancing the grind of work with the joys of living. We worked hard, and we partied harder.

But as the months slipped by, things began to shift. Allie got married, Victor transferred to another team, and I had a minor bike accident that left me laid up for a bit. Then the pandemic peaked once more, forcing us all into working from home indefinitely. Two months later, I was back in the office, noticeably heavier from my time indoors, and the team dynamic had begun to change.

That‚Äôs when Arjun appeared, a voice we‚Äôd only known through calls. In person, he was as quirky and sharp as his reputation suggested. We clicked instantly. It felt like we were forming a new version of the old team, and for a while, it seemed like we‚Äôd settled back into a familiar groove.

Then Allie resigned. She was in her notice period and mentioned that her replacement was on the way‚Äîa girl named Riya. ‚ÄúGet yourself a girlfriend,‚Äù she teased. ‚ÄúI heard she might be single.‚Äù

It was true‚ÄîI was the last single guy left in our original group. Arjun was still unattached, but it seemed more by choice than anything else. I, on the other hand, had been quietly waiting for something‚Ä¶ or someone.

When Riya arrived, she wore a pink churidar and large blue-light glasses. Her curly black hair framed a face that was long and oval-shaped, but it was her eyes that caught my attention‚Äîdeep, expressive, and breathtaking. She had this smile, made even more endearing by a pair of squirrel-like front teeth that somehow suited her perfectly. I‚Äôd never told her this, but I was drawn to her from the first glance.

From the beginning, Riya was polite but reserved. Our team had a tradition of going to the cafeteria together, and while she joined us from day one, it took a few days for her to warm up. But once she did, she was effortlessly part of our group. It was a morning after the daily stand-up meeting when we all headed to the cafeteria for coffee. I decided to break the ice with her.

‚ÄúYou seem familiar, Riya,‚Äù I said, squinting as if trying to remember. ‚ÄúHave we met before?‚Äù

She laughed, a soft sound that was both melodic and comforting. ‚ÄúI doubt it. I‚Äôve been in this city for a few years, though. Maybe we‚Äôve crossed paths without realizing.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know why, but I had this nagging feeling that I‚Äôd known her in another lifetime. As silly as it sounded, there was an odd familiarity between us, and our conversations flowed easily. Maybe it was just me, but I felt like there was an invisible thread pulling us closer, day by day.

A few days later, an emergency cropped up at work, and the whole team was bustling. Yet somehow, amid the chaos, Riya and I ended up chatting about our favorite movies. It felt like we were finding reasons to talk more, to share more.

One Saturday morning, I woke up to a text message from her: ‚ÄúHi, this is Riya.‚Äù For a split second, I thought she had reached out to me personally. But when I opened the message, I saw that it was a group text sent to everyone on the team. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit disappointed.

But it didn‚Äôt matter; by now, I had already made up my mind. I was going to ask her out.

In the meantime, our group dynamic kept evolving. Naina, a colleague from another team, started hanging out with us. She and Riya became close friends quickly, and soon the three of us began traveling to work together. They took the train regularly, so I switched from my usual bus routine and started joining them. It was a small change, but it brought us closer.

Riya knew the area well, having studied at a nearby university. One evening after work, she took us to an old building where you could watch the sunset over the ocean. We lingered there, talking about everything and nothing. On the walk back, I noticed how we always seemed to gravitate toward each other. There was a deliberate pace to our steps, as if neither of us wanted the moments to end.

One afternoon at lunch, with Naina there, the conversation turned to relationships. Naina nudged Riya playfully and asked, ‚ÄúSo, do you have a boyfriend? You should find one if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

I was eating when the answer came. It felt like time stopped. Riya casually mentioned that she had a boyfriend‚Äîof four years. They had met in college. She even showed a photo of him on her phone. I kept a smile on my face and nodded along, but inside, something cracked.

Later, as we were washing up after lunch, she talked about him again, mentioning a playful quirk of his that left me hollow. I could hear the affection in her voice. That evening, I confided in Andy, who wasn‚Äôt surprised. He‚Äôd known all along.",2,1729940263.0,PrakashamParakkatte,0,1.0,False

 I look forward to hearing the gentle whispers of my own thoughts as the world outside quietens. 

I look forward to sense of comfort it brings, on how it propels me to appreciate the smallest and simplest acts of my every day life. I look forward to watch the flickering candles,  of cradling a hot cup of coffee, watching the steam curling upwards as I inhale the rich aroma. 

I look forward to to the mysteries of this weather, the enchanting solitude that wraps around me like a soft blanket. 

I look forward to the shadows that dance through my curtains, and introspecting about the fragile nature of existence. 

I look forward to these days, where i find strength in my vulnerabilities, find comfort and acceptance in uncertainty. 

I look forward to creating a small universe of safety, surrounded by the soft glow of dim lights. I look forward to the days where the world feels softer, the surroundings feel calmer.

I look forward to the gloominess to discover the light within me. I look forward to the act of simply being.. I look forward to the gloomy weather.

I really need help. I have a bunch of succulents and some cacti (in addition to other houseplants that have leaves). The small amount of sunlight during winter time will not be enough neither for the cacti nor, I'm assuming, for the succulents.

Last year I had a bunch of cacti die on me because they didn't get enough light and I didn't know about plant lights yet. 

I don't have a lot of space so ideally I'd like to setup some kind of small plant light ""station"" in my conservatory but I'm afraid it'll get too cold when it starts snowing outside. If there's anything I could do to keep my plants from freezing to death, that'd be preferred. 

Otherwise, if the conservatory isn't a great option, I do have a little bit of space inside my apartment in the form of a coffee table.

I don't know what kind of light would be good for cacti and succulents, I don't know how many lamps they'd need, and I am overwhelmed with this stuff and don't know where to even start.

How have you guys solved the sunlight issue during winter? Do all of your plants have additional lighting? What have you done regarding temperatures? If possible, could I please see some reference photos of your setups so I can get a sense of what to do?

I‚Äôve been lurking and reading posts here for months, so I figured I‚Äôd finally reach out.

He (the friend) wanted to show us around so he took his car, bf and I hopped on. He drives and I immediately feel unsafe. He cut others off, tailgated others vehicles, merged and drifted over 3 lanes, performed unsafe passing other cars, doing 90kmph in a 60kmph zone (that‚Äôs about 60mph in 40mph for US folks). All of that, while fidgeting with the radio, his phone, the AC in the car, the sunroof, etc. I see that he trusted his car and his skills but I don‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt trust other cars to react so quickly with this reckless driving either.
I screamed and say that I was scared and please slow down. He just fking laughed and said ‚Äòmthat‚Äôs how big city is, you gotta drive like this or others will not give ways to you‚Äù 
I said I didn‚Äôt care because bf and I could drive our cars just fine here. 
Not just me but my bf also didn‚Äôt feel safe, and we voiced it. 
He found that funny and continued to perform his tricks. I almost felt like he wanted that reaction from us to laugh at us ‚Äúsmall townies‚Äù folks.

We got home safely that night but I feel that the friend did not respect my feelings and my safety, and my life. So I‚Äôve been cutting him off since then. Did not reply to his texts or calls. (My boyfriend still does)

Today he texted me again saying that he‚Äôs coming back next long weekend and if I want to go out for a coffee and I just replied ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. He asked ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù. Should I let him know that I decided to cancel this friendship? Should I just ghost him?  I don‚Äôt really like talking back and forth and apology or resolving things. Because I feel that when he put my life at risk when I voiced that I was uncomfortable and scared, that was my limit. So should I talk to him, how do I say that that‚Äôs the final decision of mine to cut him off?

Whether it's for a birthday, wedding, anniversary, or a special occasion, the pressure to get it right can be overwhelming. The good news is that with a bit of creativity, thought, and consideration, you can always find a gift that speaks volumes about how much you care. In this blog, we'll dive deep into the art of gift-giving, exploring unique and personalized gift ideas that will make your loved ones smile. Let's make sure that your next gift isn't just well-received, but unforgettable.

**Understanding the Recipient's Personality**

The first rule of thumb in gift-giving is to know your audience. Everyone has unique preferences, interests, and personality traits, and understanding these can help you select a meaningful gift. For example, some people are sentimental and appreciate gifts that have emotional value, while others prefer practical gifts that serve a specific purpose.

For instance, think about your friend who loves painting. A high-quality set of paints, brushes, or even an easel might make them ecstatic. On the other hand, if you have a tech-savvy relative who always keeps up with the latest gadgets, something like a smart home assistant or a wireless charging station would be more suitable. By tailoring your gift to the recipient's tastes, you're showing that you know and appreciate them as individuals, which is the real essence of a thoughtful present.

**Occasion-Specific Gift Ideas**

The type of event you're attending can also give you clues about what sort of gift is appropriate. Birthdays, for instance, are a celebration of the individual, and so, gifts that resonate with the person's hobbies or personal interests are often ideal. A customized journal, a stylish backpack, or even a set of their favorite snacks are thoughtful options. For milestone birthdays, consider gifting experiences rather than physical items‚Äîconcert tickets, a spa day, or even a cooking class can create lasting memories.

For weddings, the key is often to think about what the couple can enjoy together. Newlyweds might appreciate a customized piece of home decor, a luxurious bedspread, or something that helps them start their life together, like kitchen gadgets or an outdoor picnic set. Another wonderful option is to contribute to the couple's honeymoon fund‚Äîafter all, what better gift than a bit of relaxation after the chaos of wedding planning?

For anniversaries or romantic occasions, **custom Bobbleheads** are gaining popularity. These personalized figurines are a quirky and heartfelt way to commemorate a moment. They can be designed to resemble the couple, adding a touch of humor and personal significance that will make them cherish the gift for years to come. Additionally, consider gifting items that symbolize time and growth‚Äîlike a bonsai tree, an elegant watch, or even a handmade scrapbook of your favorite moments together.

**Gifts for Different Personality Types**

To further simplify your gift selection, let‚Äôs categorize some of the most common personality types and gift ideas that align well with each.

1.¬†¬†¬†¬† **The Adventurer**: If your recipient is an adrenaline junkie, they may appreciate a gift that feeds their adventurous spirit. Consider options like skydiving vouchers, hiking gear, a weekend trip to a new city, or even a GoPro camera to document their escapades.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬† **The Homebody**: For someone who enjoys the comfort of home, look for items that make their living space cozier or entertain them indoors. Think about gifting them a plush throw blanket, a scented candle set, a personalized puzzle, or a gourmet cooking kit that lets them explore new recipes.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬† **The Sentimental One**: Sentimental individuals value gifts that have a deeper meaning. Photo books, custom-made jewelry with engravings, and keepsake boxes are all excellent options. If you have shared experiences, you could create a video montage or even a framed map that shows places you have traveled together.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬† **The Tech Enthusiast**: Tech lovers are always on the lookout for the next cool gadget. Wireless earbuds, smart speakers, portable projectors, or a smartwatch could be just what they need. You could also gift them a subscription to an online service they love, like a gaming pass or a music streaming platform.

5.¬†¬†¬†¬† **The Artist**: For creative souls, the best gifts are those that allow them to express themselves. High-quality art supplies, digital tablets for drawing, or even a gift card to an art workshop can make their day. Custom Bobbleheads that represent their creative journey could also serve as inspiration and decoration for their workspace.

6.¬†¬†¬†¬† **The Traveler**: For those bitten by the travel bug, gifts like scratch-off world maps, travel journals, packing cubes, or portable power banks are not only thoughtful but also highly practical. A personalized passport holder or travel-themed photo album could also evoke memories of their past adventures.

**The Power of Personalized Gifts**

Personalized gifts are always a winner when it comes to making someone feel special. With countless options available, you can create something that perfectly fits your loved one‚Äôs style, interests, and personality. Custom Bobbleheads are a quirky and fun choice, as they capture the recipient‚Äôs likeness and are a great conversation starter. Personalized mugs, T-shirts, engraved jewelry, or photo-printed cushions are also fantastic options that can add a personal touch to any celebration.

When choosing a personalized gift, think about what will evoke memories and emotions. It could be a framed picture of a cherished moment, a necklace with both of your initials, or even a personalized calendar with special dates highlighted‚Äîthe possibilities are endless. Personalization is all about showing that you put extra thought and effort into choosing the perfect present, and that gesture alone can make any gift much more meaningful.

**Budget-Friendly Gift Ideas**

Gifting doesn't have to break the bank. You can find plenty of affordable options that still carry plenty of meaning. The key to budget-friendly gifts is to focus on creativity rather than cost. For example, if you‚Äôre good at cooking or baking, making a batch of homemade cookies or a cake is a heartfelt gesture. Alternatively, you could create a playlist of songs that have sentimental value to both you and the recipient‚Äîan easy but emotional gift that shows thoughtfulness.

Other budget-friendly options include DIY crafts, like making a customized picture frame, knitting a scarf, or creating a scrapbook of memories. You could also look for small but meaningful gifts, like a book by their favorite author, a potted plant, or even an interesting coffee mug paired with a bag of gourmet coffee. These gifts show that you know what the recipient enjoys, even if you don‚Äôt have a big budget.

**Experiential Gifts: Creating Memories That Last**

Sometimes, the best gifts aren't things at all‚Äîthey're experiences. Experiential gifts are growing in popularity as people look for ways to create lasting memories instead of accumulating more material possessions. For example, you could give a loved one a voucher for a cooking class, a yoga retreat, or even tickets to a concert or sporting event they've been wanting to attend.

For couples, consider activities they can do together, such as a wine-tasting experience, a weekend getaway, or even a couples' massage. Parents might appreciate a family outing to the zoo or a theme park, while friends could enjoy a group pottery class or an escape room adventure. Experiences like these are the kinds of gifts that people remember for years to come, and they can also be tailored to suit the interests of the recipient perfectly.

**Unique Gifts for Special Occasions**

While we‚Äôve covered several general categories of gifts, let‚Äôs dive into some unique options for those special occasions that call for something truly out of the box.

1.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Birthdays**: For someone‚Äôs birthday, consider creating a ‚Äúbirthday in a box‚Äù‚Äîfill a gift box with a mix of small items that the recipient will love, like chocolates, a candle, a small toy or trinket, and a heartfelt note. Another great idea is a ‚Äúmessage in a bottle,‚Äù where you write a touching letter and present it in a decorative glass bottle.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Weddings**: If you‚Äôre looking for a wedding gift that stands out, consider giving the couple a subscription to a meal delivery service. This can be especially helpful during their first few months of marriage when they may be too busy to cook. You could also gift them a ‚Äúdate night in a box‚Äù‚Äîinclude items like a movie, popcorn, snacks, and a board game to create a fun, romantic evening at home.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Graduations**: For graduates, consider gifts that celebrate their hard work and accomplishments while also preparing them for the next stage of life. A high-quality leather portfolio, a practical backpack, or a gift card to a home goods store can all be great options. You could also create a ‚Äúgraduation survival kit‚Äù with items like snacks, inspirational books, and gift cards for coffee or groceries.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Housewarmings**: Housewarming gifts are all about making a new space feel like home. Consider gifts that add a touch of warmth, like a cozy throw blanket, a set of matching dish towels, or a houseplant that‚Äôs easy to care for. Personalized cutting boards, a set of artisan soaps, or even a decorative piece of wall art can make the recipient's new place feel a little more personal.

**The Art of Presentation: How to Make Your Gift Stand Out**

Sometimes, it‚Äôs not just the gift itself that makes an impression, but also how it‚Äôs presented. Taking the time to wrap your gift in a thoughtful way can make all the difference. Consider using unique wrapping materials, such as colorful fabric, reusable gift bags, or even pages from an old map for a travel-themed gift. Adding a handwritten note is another great way to make your gift extra special.

For a fun twist, try ‚Äúnesting‚Äù smaller gifts inside larger boxes to create an element of surprise. You can also hide a smaller, more meaningful item inside something less expected‚Äîfor example, placing a piece of jewelry inside a plush toy or hiding a gift card inside a book. These small touches help make the gift-giving experience more memorable for both you and the recipient.

**Conclusion: Thoughtfulness Is the Best Gift of All**

At the end of the day, the best gifts are those that come from the heart. It‚Äôs not about how much money you spend or how extravagant the present is‚Äîit‚Äôs about showing that you‚Äôve put genuine thought into choosing something that will bring joy to the recipient. Whether it‚Äôs a personalized Bobblehead, an experience you can share together, or a DIY craft that took time and care to create, the most important thing is that the gift reflects your relationship and celebrates the person receiving it.

Next time you're faced with the challenge of choosing a gift, remember that thoughtfulness goes a long way. Make an effort to understand the recipient's personality, think about the occasion, and consider what would truly make them smile. By focusing on the details and putting your heart into the process, you can transform the act of gift-giving into something meaningful, impactful, and unforgettable.

Tried this pre workout for the first time and thought I‚Äôd let you guys know my experience. 

###Taste: 2/10
It tastes only a little better than cherry flavored medicine. Definitely took some willpower to drink this shit lol

###Mixing: 9/10
It mixed nearly perfect in a water bottle. There was a little powder in the bottom halfway through drinking so I shook it again and it fully dissolved.


###Stim: 10/10
First off, I took a full scoop that was probably more than enough. Scoop was taken right when I woke up as a sort of morning coffee. 

10 minutes in was the slight kind of itchiness that motivates you to work out and get rid of that uncomfortable feeling. 

30 minutes in was a massive boost in energy. Leg exercises weren‚Äôt nearly as hard and I was lifting more weight than usual. 

There was also jitteriness that made it hard to focus on working out but that was probably because I wasn‚Äôt used to the caffeine

###Digestion: 7/10
**Drink water during workout**. Seriously, this is written on the container for a reason. I had to poop twice during my workout and my stomach started hurting about an hour after taking it. Water immediately helped so you‚Äôll be good as long as you stay hydrated


###Verdict
Seriously the best pre-workout I‚Äôve tried, although I‚Äôve only tried two others before this. Maybe get the peach mango flavor since I heard that one is better but regardless the effects are worth the bad taste",2,1729939239.0,Preworkoutsupplements,1,1.0,False

1gci89i,https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/1gci89i/roguelike_with_hub_progression_structure/,"Roguelike with ""hub"" progression structure?","I'm looking for a game that I'm nots sure exists.

I enjoy the tight streamlined gameplay of coffee break roguelikes (Jupiter Hell, Rogue Fable, etc), and I also really enjoy having a long-lived character that I invest in beyond just one large dungeon (Caves of Qud, etc), but I don't always want the RPG-style overworld that comes with it.

I'm wondering if there's a roguelike out there where the core gameplay is tight dungeon dives (doesn't have to be literally dungeons, any setting is fine) but your character is persistent and progression is across many ""runs"", facilitated by a hub of some sort. In games like Darkest Dungeon and XCOM these hubs are glorified menus, but they serve that purpose. I don't know of any games like this that don't involve managing a party, so maybe that's where it falls apart in the context of a roguelike?

Note I'm not asking for meta-progression, dying shouldn't give you anything. Though ideally I'd like the option to opt out of permadeath ‚Äî for long runs (eg: Qud) I don't always have the patience for a full reset vs go-back-to-checkpoint.

I've actually started building a game like this myself because I want to play it so much, but while I'm a senior engineer at work I'm an absolute novice at game dev and design, so the game in my head almost definitely won't see the light of day haha.",6,1729939126.0,roguelikes,4,0.88,False
1gci7d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/buddie/comments/1gci7d9/why_and_how_episode_5_was_a_win_for_buddie/,Why and How Episode 5 Was A Win For Buddie,"Strap in, friends‚Äîthis is going to be a **long** post, but there's so much to break down and unpack here. The discourse around this episode has been... interesting, to say the least. I honestly feel like I watched a different episode than some because, from my perspective, we won **big** this week. It‚Äôs genuinely baffling to see so many viewers saying we ‚Äúlost.‚Äù After browsing Reddit, Tumblr, TikTok, and Twitter, the sentiment seemed pretty much the same across platforms‚Äîpeople feeling dejected, as though we missed out on something crucial. And I get it: the buildup and anticipation for this episode were massive. Expectations were sky-high, with everyone expecting those pivotal Buddie moments to unfold between episodes 4 and 6, only to feel like things stagnated or backtracked in episode 5. But I‚Äôm here to say that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.

To make it clear, here‚Äôs a comment I left on another thread that really sums up what I think is happening with this episode and the discourse surrounding it:

>

And honestly, this rings truer than ever after seeing this episode. The lack of attention to the subtle yet **deliberate choices** being made by the team‚Äîchoices in lighting, blocking, costumes, and, yes, even the micro-expressions on the actors‚Äô faces‚Äîleaves a huge portion of the storytelling totally overlooked. There was so much more going on than just what was spoken in the dialogue.

Another thing that‚Äôs worth mentioning: that reel they dropped *right* before this episode aired. It wasn‚Äôt a coincidence; that‚Äôs the kind of narrative setup that gives insight and should have tipped everyone off. It‚Äôs been surprising to see Buddie shippers getting caught up in this sense of defeat when so much of this episode was packed with substance. I respect everyone‚Äôs right to feel how they feel, and I understand why some may perceive this episode as a letdown, but genuinely, **this episode was a goldmine of subtext**.

If we‚Äôre only focusing on what was *said*, then yes, it may have seemed like we didn‚Äôt get much progression. But in terms of visual storytelling, so many choices were made. And not just any choices‚Äîdeliberate ones that point to something greater in the narrative. The lighting was strategic, the blocking emphasized connections and subtle tensions, and wardrobe choices weren‚Äôt random. Even down to the smallest expressions on the actors‚Äô faces, this episode told a layered story that, in my opinion, is only leading to more significant developments.

**Things mentioned I've been seeing that I want to touch on and hopefully answer:**

1. BuckTommy seem like their endgame¬†
2. Eddie was so ooc
3. We lost so bad¬†
4. The Tommy and Eddie friendship is so uncomfortable¬†
5. Eddie isn‚Äôt even looking at Buck¬†

Now, let's get into it.

**1st Hospital Scene**

This hospital scene definitely threw some people off, mainly due to Eddie and Tommy's laughter. Prior to that, fans were mostly happy to see a BT scene that included Eddie and clearly emphasized what we've been saying all along...until Eddie and Tommy laugh at Buck. So, let's break down exactly what went on.

The scene opens with Buck getting his shoulder popped back into place, while Eddie, seemingly engrossed in his magazine, shakes his head. Here‚Äôs where people start to notice Eddie‚Äôs lack of eye contact with Buck‚Äîhe‚Äôs checked out, or at least seems to be. But he does glance up for a split second, pausing to stare at Buck until the camera pans to Tommy in the doorway. Eddie‚Äôs tendency to look at Buck while Buck isn‚Äôt looking back is something we‚Äôll get into more, but it happens repeatedly throughout the episode.

https://preview.redd.it/jc9swrpch2xd1.png?width=2606&format=png&auto=webp&s=4777696c021d8975c0084753c11ec3aeb0d11382

https://preview.redd.it/kgh6psdpm1xd1.png?width=2478&format=png&auto=webp&s=0043343ce2efa0fc7a35731f1d73361fd816213a

Then Eddie asks the doctor, ‚ÄúHow long do you think until he can come back to the firehouse?‚Äù This wording is interesting‚Äîwhy ask specifically about Buck returning to the *firehouse*, and not just ‚Äúwork‚Äù in general? The specific choice of ‚Äúfirehouse‚Äù feels deeper, or at least a strong desire for Buck to be back in that environment. Eddie seemed checked out a moment ago, but he‚Äôs the one who steps up to speak for Buck. Why? Why did Eddie need to ask the doctor on Buck‚Äôs behalf? Especially with Tommy standing there, hanging back in the doorway. If Tommy is Buck‚Äôs boyfriend, why doesn‚Äôt he step forward?

This framing is a recurring choice. Tommy, as Buck‚Äôs boyfriend, stands on the sidelines with a visitor‚Äôs badge, while Eddie is the one by Buck‚Äôs side, speaking for him, waiting with him, and engaging directly with the doctors. The camera then shows Eddie looking visibly relieved by the doctor‚Äôs answer. Now, wouldn‚Äôt a boyfriend be the one to walk right in and make his presence known? But Tommy remains in the background until the doctors leave.

Let's also talk about Eddie‚Äôs choice to stay in the room. He‚Äôs still in his work clothes, clearly there for a while, which tells us he‚Äôs been waiting with Buck for quite a bit. He's the one sitting down, while Tommy remains standing. However, once Tommy arrives, Eddie doesn‚Äôt leave. He doesn‚Äôt get up to give Buck and Tommy privacy. Instead, he just gets more comfortable, flipping through his magazine as if it‚Äôs his right to stay there. As a friend, his job was done. He could have given the couple some space, but he didn't. Choices, choices.

Eddie doesn't acknowledge Tommy‚Äôs presence. Eddie only looks and acknowledges Tommy's presence in this scene when Tommy says everyone at harbor laughing at what happened. The smile Eddie gives him was an interesting one. Very much giving how he looked at Taylor in that dinner scene. We then have Tommy looking at Eddie, saying, ‚ÄúFor the moment? What does that even mean?‚Äù After he asks Buck the details. Eddie‚Äôs response is almost dismissive, he doesn't look up from the magazine as he replies, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even ask.‚Äù It‚Äôs an interaction that shows a clear disconnect‚ÄîEddie isn't trying to bond with Tommy; he‚Äôs firmly focused on Buck.

Throughout this scene, Eddie‚Äôs disengagement from Tommy is as striking as his attention to Buck. There‚Äôs a pointedness in how Eddie interjects just enough to fill in the blanks for Buck, making it clear he‚Äôs actively listening to every word, despite keeping his eyes on his magazine. Who knows how long Buck was in the hospital. That rambling he went on was based on information he clearly gathered while he was in the hospital or on the way to the hospital. Buck likes to share the information he's learned so it's safe to assume he's been sharing all of it with Eddie in real time. Which we can gather by Eddie saying ""I told you not to ask"" because he's heard all of that before and Eddie was there every step of the way listening to his rambling.

We finally have Eddie looking up  when Buck mentions ‚Äúa twist,‚Äù fully closing his magazine and settling in to listen to what Buck has to say. The framing here is fascinating too‚Äîwhen Tommy asks about the twist, the camera shifts to Eddie instead of staying with Tommy. Again, choices.

Then Eddie and Tommy burst out laughing. Honestly, this is probably the scene that made shippers the most uncomfortable. Like, why is Eddie laughing at Buck? By this point, Eddie has likely been listening to Buck ramble about the curse for hours, so it‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs had his fill of it. Some people interpret this scene as Tommy and Eddie being friendly, ganging up on Buck, but I think there‚Äôs a significant disconnect between them.

Eddie keeps his eyes locked on Buck the entire time he laughs, which is key. Tommy, on the other hand, looks at Eddie first and only laughs after he sees Eddie burst out laughing. If Eddie had glanced at Tommy and they made eye contact while they both laughed, it would paint a clearer picture of them being buddy-buddy, fully in sync as they mock Buck together. Instead, Eddie had his eyes set on Buck when he starts to laugh. It had nothing to do with Tommy.

It‚Äôs also telling that every time Tommy seems confused by Buck‚Äôs ramblings, he glances at Eddie‚Äîfive times in total during this scene! Meanwhile, Eddie only looks at Tommy once. When Eddie laughs, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be out of mockery; he doesn‚Äôt give Tommy that ‚ÄúOMG, he‚Äôs crazy!‚Äù look that Tommy shoots at him after Buck‚Äôs wild story. You also hear Eddie say, ""I'm sorry, I just...""

Now, let‚Äôs dive into Buck‚Äôs reaction to Tommy laughing compared to how he reacts to Eddie. Eddie laughs first, but Buck doesn‚Äôt even glance his way‚Äîhe keeps his eyes trained on Tommy. The way Buck‚Äôs gaze follows Tommy feels like a silent question: ‚Äú*Excuse* me? You‚Äôre *laughing* at me?‚Äù

And we can‚Äôt ignore the stark contrast in how Buck looks at Eddie versus Tommy. It‚Äôs almost palpable. On the left, you can see Buck‚Äôs gaze directed at Eddie, while on the right, Buck is looking at Tommy. This is just exhibit A. There are so many more examples of this dynamic‚Äîit‚Äôs honestly insane how pronounced the differences are in every interaction they have.

https://preview.redd.it/nmt12jzfv1xd1.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=c87d14a96604ce89d38b2e63b35307de4532f5d3

**The Loft Scene Without Eddie**

Watching this scene for the first time was incredibly awkward. I was literally yelling, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not his dad!‚Äù at the screen. By the second viewing, I actually gagged. This scene was so, so bad that I can‚Äôt even find the right words to explain it. I had my suspicions about the intentions behind Tommy's character in this episode, and while I won‚Äôt dive into that here, I just knew he wouldn‚Äôt be written well. I could never have imagined it would turn out to be this bad.

The scene starts off kind of cute. Tommy is taking care of Buck, handing him a new ice pack, pills, and fixing his pillows. But then he says, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs time to put away the screen.‚Äù I visibly cringed. The inflection in his voice, the cadence and tone‚Äîit's just like a parent talking to a child. And Buck automatically slips into that childlike role, responding with, ‚ÄúFive more minutes.‚Äù This moment marks the first time we see these two share an intimate moment at night. If Buck needed to sleep sitting up, he could‚Äôve done that in bed; there was no reason for Tommy to be on the couch and for them to be that far apart. Even with Buck being hurt, there were so many ways to make this scene more domestic between them, underscoring the fact that they‚Äôre in a relationship.

Then Tommy replies off-screen, ‚ÄúYou already had your five more minutes.‚Äù I practically gagged. ARE YOU HIS FATHER?? The camera doesn‚Äôt even pan to him at that moment; it only does when he continues with, ‚ÄúYou need to rest if you want to heal. You heard the doctor.‚Äù He sounds so annoyed, as if he‚Äôs being forced to care for Buck against his will.

When Buck mentions his research findings, Tommy deadpans, ‚ÄúOh good, you found a substack.‚Äù It‚Äôs just an excruciatingly painful moment to watch. And then there‚Äôs the line, ‚ÄúLights out, Evan.‚Äù The actual hell. YOU. ARE. NOT. HIS. DAD.

He finishes with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exhausted.‚Äù And you don‚Äôt think Buck is exhausted after what he‚Äôs been through? Tommy‚Äôs attitude is so harsh that it honestly made me sad. There was absolutely no reason for the dialogue to come off like a father scolding a stubborn child.

One standout moment for me during my first watch was when Buck asks Tommy if he wants to know how he got caught. When Buck reveals that his own posse hogtied him, the camera pans to Tommy, capturing a look of annoyance on his face that‚Äôs just seconds away from an eye roll. It‚Äôs not even fond exasperation‚Äîit‚Äôs more like a silent, ‚ÄúShut the fuck upppp.‚Äù

We see Buck go down the internet rabbit hole with Tommy, but it‚Äôs safe to assume he did the same thing while in the hospital. And we know Eddie had to endure the same rambling. While we saw Eddie get annoyed, he never dismissed Buck the way Tommy did. Eddie displayed that fond exasperation that comes from being in love, while Tommy's disdain is glaring. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs Lou‚Äôs acting or the writing, but the way Tommy comes off is just so frustratingly unhelpful.

When Buck repeats himself, Tommy says, ‚ÄúYou said that already.‚Äù Meanwhile, Eddie just lets Buck ramble and tries to calm him down with rational arguments, which we see in the next scene. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the cringeworthy ‚ÄúGoodnight, Evan.‚Äù

**The Loft Scene with Eddie**

The next scene continues in the morning, and Tommy says, ‚ÄúThink someone was up too late with their cowboy.‚Äù What the actual hell is this shit, Tim? Why is this written this way? Tommy sounds like a parent talking to a child! It was so over-the-top that it‚Äôs hard to believe it was done unintentionally; this is not how grown adults in a relationship should interact.

When Tommy sees the boils on Buck‚Äôs face, his reaction is alarming. He yells and recoils back, clearly freaked out. Buck cuts him off by saying ‚Äúphone,‚Äù but Tommy tries to change the subject. Buck repeats ‚Äúphone,‚Äù louder and more insistent. His tone really stood out to me.

The scene transitions to Eddie leaning in close to apply ointment on Buck‚Äôs face‚Äîquite the contrast to Tommy‚Äôs jump back and his obvious discomfort.

When Buck says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you can say it,‚Äù it could mean that he didn‚Äôt react outwardly the way Tommy did when he first saw Buck. Could it be that Tommy texted Eddie beforehand, warning him to act cool? It‚Äôs definitely a possibility. Eddie reassures Buck, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not bad.‚Äù Tommy glances at Eddie, but Eddie keeps his focus on Buck, reiterating, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that bad.‚Äù

When Buck begins to ramble about the curse again, Eddie gets exasperated but remains supportive, trying to talk Buck down from his worries. In stark contrast, Tommy just offers the useless information that he has an ‚Äúaccountant cousin‚Äù.

When Eddie mentions Buck slipping on a pumpkin, Tommy says, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt tell me that. There‚Äôs your answer, Evan.‚Äù He doesn't even try. So unhelpful. Buck waves his hand dismissively, saying, ‚ÄúNo, if it was the pumpkin, it would have happened right away and not the next day,‚Äù and he seems to be glaring at Tommy as he does so. Tommy‚Äôs expression afterward? Pure annoyance.

Eddie then adds to the conversation while Buck remains silent, trying to calm him by listing skin conditions that could explain what‚Äôs happening. He leans closer to Buck while he is talking, while Tommy was the one who jumped back and is sitting a distance away from him with a physical barrier.

When Tommy mentions his accountant cousin and his skin condition being gross, Buck responds, clearly upset, ‚ÄúOh, so I am gross,‚Äù after he had asked Eddie to say it in the beginning. Tommy can only respond with, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I said.‚Äù It‚Äôs weak. Unhelpful. Eddie steps in again, advising Buck that ‚Äúthis curse talk is spinning you out, which is not good for you.‚Äù Meanwhile, all Tommy can contribute is, ‚ÄúListen to the medic. He knows what he‚Äôs talking about.‚Äù

That entire time Eddie is staring at Buck while Buck is looking at Tommy.

The scene is dominated by Eddie being genuinely helpful to Buck. Yes, he‚Äôs annoyed, but he also listens. He isn‚Äôt condescending or dismissive, unlike Tommy. Their exchanges create a stark contrast; when Buck is looking at Tommy, Eddie keeps his eyes locked on Buck. They share that beat of eye contact, leading Buck to respond to Eddie, ‚ÄúIf you say so,‚Äù while maintaining that gaze. Eddie doesn‚Äôt break eye contact as he softly assures him, ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù And we see Buck actually calm down and they shake hands.

We have Tommy and Eddie looking at each other this scene but it's completely different from the hospital scene. Again, they don't even speak directly to each other.

Now for my favourite game of Let's Guess Who He's Looking At!

**The Firehouse**

I absolutely love the scene in the firehouse between Buddie; it‚Äôs just so  them. This time, Eddie avoids eye contact with Buck, not staring him as he usually does. He avoids staring at Buck's face. Interesting because at the loft, he was seemingly unbothered and even leaning close and shaking Bucks hand. So what changed? Eddie pulls out the money before Buck even has the chance to say anything. Again, just so them. This interaction feels like a direct parallel to Tommy and Buck‚Äôs dynamic in the loft. Buck is more confident and is able to push back against Eddie‚Äôs skepticism about the curse. It shows how they stand as equals in this moment‚Äîquite a contrast to the hierarchy present between Buck and Tommy.

Look at how close they stand; there‚Äôs no distance or barriers between them. This intimacy starkly contrasts with Buck‚Äôs interactions with Tommy. In their two scenes alone, there's a palpable sense of social distancing. I also have to call back to ""you look like a vision in a cone"" they were sitting side by side, shoulders touching and Buck even nudges him. What changed? Why was all we got a brief hand on the knee? Back to the scene, this is the only scene in which Eddie doesn't stare at Buck directly and it's the only scene they are alone. Which could mean nothing.

**The Hospital Scene**

In the hospital scene, we see Buck scratching his face. While Eddie is engrossed in his phone, seemingly disconnected from the moment. Both Chim and Eddie are engrossed on their phones. Tommy walks in carrying coffee and immediately chastises Buck with, ‚ÄúStop picking,‚Äù like a parent talking to a child. Buck responds with a defensive tone, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt picking,‚Äù which almost sounds childlike in its innocence.

Then Eddie interjects, saying, ‚ÄúYou were picking.‚Äù Here‚Äôs the thing: why does he feel the need to insert himself into this moment between Buck and Tommy? And how does he know what Buck is doing when he‚Äôs so absorbed in his phone? This seems to establish a theme where Eddie, despite appearing distracted, is oddly in tune with Buck‚Äôs actions and words. But Chim? Completely checked out.

[on the left is when Buck responds to Tommy when he tells him to stop picking and on the right is how Buck looks at Eddie when he says he was picking. ](https://preview.redd.it/wsn1pg6492xd1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ab0bbc80a5d67f2438717f045b426d4adbd3d51)

When the nurse asks Buck if he checked in, Buck tells her it's just his face. Tommy rolls his eyes and the camera pans to Eddie who is looking at Buck while sucking on a ring pop and nods at the nurse. Buck chuckles at the nurse's reaction and Tommy looks at Buck like he hates him.

[again, the difference. ](https://preview.redd.it/lniziyyl92xd1.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c6e5d7bc7c72e45e6aea60a2801f209fe2d7a4e)

When Tommy asks what happened after the text message arrives, Buck explains the situation, and we see a flash of jealousy from Tommy regarding the bond Buck has with the 118. Buck is so absorbed in his lightbulb moment about breaking the curse that he doesn‚Äôt even notice Tommy‚Äôs jealousy. The camera then pans to Chim and Eddie. Chim is completely checked out of the conversation, while Eddie‚Äôs gaze remains locked on Buck.

The difference in reactions between Eddie and Tommy is telling. Eddie closes his eyes, shakes his head, and returns to his phone, a clear sign of exasperation but not true annoyance. In contrast, Tommy audibly sighs, shakes his head, rolls his eyes, and shakes his head again, showing true annoyance and frustration Yet again, even in a moment meant for Tommy and Buck, Eddie is keenly aware of Buck and what he‚Äôs saying. When the camera pans back to him he's already looking at Buck.

[The difference in how they react when Buck says he figured out how to break the curse](https://preview.redd.it/45js932va2xd1.png?width=1804&format=png&auto=webp&s=39e3b7d4f537bce06a581f714524933da4780dcb)

**The Funeral Scene**

This scene sent fans into a frenzy, largely because Buck explicitly uses the word ""boyfriend."" By this point, they‚Äôve been dating for six months, so we all know what they are. His verbal acknowledgment doesn‚Äôt change the fact, but the context of him saying it is crucial. Notably, when he says it, there‚Äôs no shot of him looking at Tommy or making eye contact.

The episode ends with Buck saying, ‚ÄúRest easy, Billy, and hey, maybe lift this curse,‚Äù followed by a quick backward glance at Tommy. This fleeting glance is almost like a silent acknowledgment that Tommy is tied to the curse he wishes to break. The way Buck walks away afterward‚Äîwith just a backward glance‚Äîspeaks volumes. The last shot we see is the physical distance between Buck and Tommy. They could have walked back to the car hand in hand, yet Buck leaves Tommy behind, who has to jog to catch up. This final frame feels loaded with meaning.

The only time we got a close up lingering shot of Tommy is when he says ‚Äúplease lift it‚Äù to the grave.¬†Sweetie I think it might be you. The episode ends with this being the last frame:

This post is getting so insanely long over here but I want to mention a couple of things.

# More Observations

1. **Framing and Focus**: The close-ups of Buck‚Äôs and Eddie‚Äôs faces during their conversations allow us to see their expressions and emotional reactions more clearly. The only time we get a similar focus on Tommy is during the night loft scene, but it‚Äôs centered around his reactions to Buck, not their interaction. This difference in framing feels intentional and tells us where the narrative‚Äôs focus lies.

[framing when Tommy is looking at Buck](https://preview.redd.it/ppf2r4jt03xd1.png?width=2306&format=png&auto=webp&s=c52560e22dc2215b5df720f03ee885a2d31f2c64)

[Framing when Eddie is looking at Buck](https://preview.redd.it/v3hqkmdw03xd1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7cbf5635387b12dab905356fccccc85d4f9cf02)

**2. Eddie‚Äôs Eye Contact**: There‚Äôs been chatter about Eddie barely looking at Buck. However, let‚Äôs break this down: Eddie only avoids eye contact when he‚Äôs alone with Buck in the firehouse. You could argue it‚Äôs due to feeling grossed out, but he‚Äôs shown to have no problem maintaining eye contact with Buck in the loft. In fact, I included screenshots of every instance where Eddie looks at Buck, and it‚Äôs clear he often watches him intently when Buck isn‚Äôt aware. Eddie may pretend to be engrossed in a magazine or his phone, yet he‚Äôs actually paying close attention to everything Buck does and says. In that final scene, while Chim is completely checked out, Eddie maintains an observant eye on Buck. This moment is particularly telling: it was supposed to be about Buck and Tommy, but Eddie‚Äôs is always a looming presence.

I have no idea where people got the idea that Eddie was barely looking at Buck, because he was. He very much was. I can't remember a time Eddie was staring this much at Buck. And in my opinion, there was a lot of emphasis on it as well.

Last point: Eddie again did not interact with Tommy in the last hospital scene. No one did. Athena, Bobby, Chim, and Eddie. The most important people in Buck's life were all sitting near each other. We have Chim talking to Bobby in the beginning, fist bumping Eddie, Buck leaning back to let Bobby know Hen texted. But not once do any of them interact with Tommy. Not even a glance from Chim. And again, Eddie has been in three scenes with them at this point and not once do they speak directly to each other.

I hope this expanded perspective sheds light on how significant these moments are in the episode. The contrast between the BT and Buddie and the three of them‚ÄîEddie‚Äôs attentive, almost protective demeanor towards Buck and Tommy‚Äôs more strained interactions. This episode was definitely a win for us, underscoring how the relationship between Buck and Tommy is written so plainly that it feels poised to shift. In fact, it already did shift. I have never seen Buck dislike one of his partners so blatantly. The evidence is there.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.

I‚Äôm not for or against medication. Just curious what pros/cons you noticed if you started meds late in life or opted to just keep hacking it but with better awareness of WHY you have to hack life. 

I‚Äôm not on medication. Pro: one less thing to see a doctor about (hate going to them), no dry mouth, or worrying about when it‚Äôll wear off. 

Con: I‚Äôve never had a career because I burn out in jobs or get bored of them and move on. I wonder if with medication I‚Äôd stick to a career path better. ",24,1729938778.0,adhdwomen,54,0.93,False

1gci45a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1gci45a/would_love_some_advice_on_bringing_up_discussion/,Would love some advice on bringing up discussion on sexual interests and libido,"Hello fellow love seekers , good luck out there!

I‚Äôm upper 40s M, matched with lower 40s F about a week ago.   By all accounts and purposes it‚Äôs going swimmingly.   Matched on Friday, 5 hour conversation on Saturday, coffee on Sunday, several more few hour phone conversations then lunch on Thursday.   We are going to dinner tomorrow Sunday, which she initiated during Lunch.

So with her time and posture all things are going absolutely perfectly.   Progressing at a good pace and equal energy given by all.   

A couple of side notes, I‚Äôm extremely complimentary by nature and I‚Äôve fought myself to not overdo it yet pepper in some occasional but timely and appropriate compliments maybe 4-5x a day.   She seems to be neutral almost to them, and when I jokingly softly asked what that was about she said her marriage/divorce she was never complimented so she doesn‚Äôt feel worthy and has trouble accepting compliments.   Unfortunately we got cut off before being able to discuss more fully.    Also, she has given almost no compliments on her own.    

My love languages are pretty much all of them with an emphasis on touch, then quality time and words of affirmation.   Another girl in there told me ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs all guys‚Äù.  Which I can totally see.  LOL.     

The discussions have been amazing and deep from the get go.   All topics freely and openly and vulnerably discussed (I‚Äôm talking really deep dives with amazingly similar thoughts, ideals, wants etc)  with the exception of sex. 

I‚Äôm purposely not pushing the envelope and I do realize we haven‚Äôt even been on a first dinner date yet so I‚Äôm keeping my worries at bay.   But in nearly all of my previous relationships by the time it‚Äôs gotten this far emotionally and vulnerably, the conversation of sex and the whole vibe of sexiness and compliments are usually well under way.    I‚Äôve made a few very tasteful innuendos which are just moved past and just nothing really going on in that department.   Which is definitely weird for me, and I am a very sexual person

My question is, should I even be worried about that lack at this point since everything else is going so well‚Ä¶..tomorrow date will be a big determinant I think.    The compliment thing, mixed with the lack of sensual and sexual flirting is worrisome but then again I have been very very careful not to push too hard and seem creepy or a FB.    But at the same time I have a very high libido (ideally I‚Äôd say 4-5x per week but with the right partner I could see having sex 2 a day, I‚Äôm very adventurous, love fulfilling partner first and trying new things.   And I have learned this is a non negotiable for me in a partner to want these things also.   Her love language was admittedly and far and away acts of service.   Given we both have young kids and crazy lives I can respect that as hers and I can be there to step up and be whatever service and help she needs‚Ä¶..but I also know that I need somebody that is really touchy (even just holding hands when walking or touching my leg during dinner) and highly sexual and adventurous 

So should I be concerned and what‚Äôs the best way to really lay the groundwork to address this topic over the next few dates.  I‚Äôm concerned with getting friendzoned and that‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôd like to know sooner than later if there is sexual compatibility even on paper.  

Thanks!

1gci23c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1gci23c/f4m_treasure_hunting/,[F4M] Treasure hunting ,"*‚Äúùìê tequilaon the rocks, please""* a low voice from the counter brought the brooding bartender out of his reverie and promptly stood up to take a look at his customer. 


It was a dingy bar. The yellow light from the LEDs did not help make the cramped space more inviting. The bar was empty except for a few patrons taking refuge in the dark corners of the room, and the woman whose face was shadowed by the brim of the hat she was wearing -  sitting at the counter.


The bartender shrugged, his eyes lingering on the woman a second longer than it was necessary, and prepared her order.  It wasn‚Äôt long before the order was placed on the counter, and she reached to accept it while sliding a card to show the barman. 


*‚Äú...Can you tell him there‚Äôs someone waiting for him? ‚Äù* There was no accent to her speech, except for a slight hesitation before she spoke, a slight indication that the language she was speaking wasn‚Äôt her native tongue. 


The business card, or so it looked, glistened even under the dim light of the bar, and no one could ignore the golden insignia embossed at the corner.


The bartender hummed, taking a long look at it, before proceeding to clean a dusty glass with a ragged cloth. ‚ÄúA Detective, or an Assassin?‚Äù his tone was nonchalant, but she could hear the underlying threat and panic beneath the tough exterior of his voice.  


*‚ÄúNeither""* the woman responded, her hand still clutching the corners of the card. As if she was afraid to lose it. *‚ÄúJust an old friend""*


Her companion gave another shrug and pointed to a corner of the dingy pub. ‚ÄúOver there. Don‚Äôt know what business you have with him, but don‚Äôt be disappointed if he doesn‚Äôt accept‚Äù 


The woman nodded and picked up the card, pocketed it carefully, and got down from the bar stool. 


She was short, compared to many women in this country, but that didn‚Äôt matter, 5‚Äô2‚Äù was the average height for a woman where she was from. 


The young woman, no older than 23 years, crossed the dingy old bar to the other corner where the bartender showed and sat at the table occupied by another man, shrouded in shadows. 


*""Still up with the dramatics I see,""*  the young woman said, her lips quirking upwards to a small smile under the shadow of her hat. 


She reached to the inside of her pocket and produced a frail, worn old paper, opening it up on the table, her dusky skin complimenting the coffee colour of the paper. 


*‚Äú... Are you up for another adventure, old friend?""* Natasha smiled a tone of amusement in her voice.

*Good day to everyone here! If you made it this far, I believe you are interested in what i‚Äôve got to say to all of you. My name is Myth, 21+ years old, and i have been writing and roleplaying for nearly seven years.*


*That aside, I am currently looking for males who play as  descriptive male characters in the third person pov, preferably who can write atleast a couple of paragraphs per reply, and match the length of the partner. And those who are able to write multiple paragraphs if the time calls for it.*


*Now, for the given starter, you might be wondering, what's going on in there, and the answer is, whatever you'd like to be, give me your ideas, and we'll see how it would best suit the storyline.*


*But basically, my character, Natasha, meets your character, who could be a reputable man, or an infamous man according to your taste, and the two of them had been acquainted before. They could go in search of something valuable or retrieve a lost treasure, and that would be up to discussion, of course.*


*The plot, of course, could lead to many different paths, from adventure mystery and romance to thriller.*


*If you're still interested, please do send me a DM with a writing sample, written in 3rd person POV.  (chats aren't going to be prioritized). My usual writing platform is Discord.*

1gci1gn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gci1gn,"Had to assist a hatch early at internal pip stage and help her hatch over 4 days. She was breach and suffocating under the membrane not being able to properly break it for air. 4 days and sleepless nights. Now she's happy and healthy standing in 12h from detached umbilical! And now 24h from ""hatch""","This baby was breech and couldn't internally pip, 6 days before hatch day i had to intervene.  Here is the details of exactly what I did so you can use this to assist. I am an avain carer and rehabber, I study in uni originally to become a vet nurse but dropped out. I do not know the answer to everything and while I'm ""an expert"" I also am happy to take advice and such
 This information is so you and I know what to do and how I helped her survive a death sentence of a hatch. 

At 4pm 23rd of oct i had canndled as always (until pip then I lock down) 
I had observed yesterday the usual round air cell appear peaked/like a mountain and then again at 3pm the same peak, held my ear to the egg and could hear the baby, what sounded like gentle monching. I decided since she hadn't progressed as quickly as I'd hoped I'd dril a safety hole with a needle as a just incase.
3hs later still no change. So I (wit sterile tools) made the hole bigger, just nail head size so I could see. And I could see her breathing under the membrane, she was getting weaker and weaker as she breathed the wet membrane with only two tiny tears in the membrane. 
Slowly every 4 hours I made the hole bigger and tore the membrane very slowly and gently. 

That's when I saw her feet and yolk. She was twisted, not a really bad breech but breech enough that she would have a risk of breaking her yolk. She was so weak and had started to give up.

I introduced periods of white light and recordings of mother ducks every 3 hours and that would help. As she got stronger i slowly peeled more egg away working the membrane gently and wetting it with a clean q tip every 3hours, sometimes every 1h (no I barely slept I've been running on coffee and stress.) 
Slowly and carefully i made sure to always use sterile tools and q tips and fresh warm water (freshly boiled then cooled till lightly warm is best) 
I got her neck free on day 24 at 4pm and and her breathing then stabilised and became more steady. 
(Still doing 10 to 15 minute periods of white light and sound to encourage her and increase success (there's studies on it.) 
By day 25 I had her mostly free and and gently placed her in a pie dish (mini) so the yolk and egg were clean and stayed close but still allowed her to kick and move gently. (She needs to move and ""hatch"" to build up muscle and suck in the yolk, a chicks need to fight and they fight hard when given those therapies I mentioned. 

She went from weak and slow and not talking to making tiny chirps.
At 7pm on oct 25th she detached, her belly button was barely visible and everything was nice and dry. I disposed of the egg shell immediately and did my best to cycle out water from the incubator by using my own heater and warm water to let the incubator quickly dry out and then refill without it affecting her negatively. Misting warm water and only ever opening the incubator at and angle, never taking the lid off. I periodically cycled the water and made sure to mist everything every time I opened and carefully regulated the temps.

Now 26th 9pm she is sitting under a silkie who wasn't even broody but now thinks she hatched a duck. Pic at the end! :) I'm so glad to finally get some sleep, literally kept the incubator next to my computer so I could keep and eye on her constantly.  

Over this i did everything slowly and only touched her every 4h minimum before peeling more shell and membrane, stop when you see red blood, use sterile tools and clean the bench and prepare with warm mist, wash hands, and wet hands with hot/warm water before grabbing egg and taking it out to remove more shell. I did all this sitting at my desk so there no risk of dropping or anything. 

I used and torch for white light exposure and my phone YouTube shorts for ducklings under mother video for the sound. Giving these therapies every 4 to 5 hours for minimum 15 minutes. 

I've rescued and raised babies many times never hatched before, this was a very fun fist hatch. But im so glad everything went well. 

Also literally just brought a silkie inside (non broody/ has recently stopped off and on for the last month) and she now is nesting and letting her cuddle under her and talking. :)",23,1729938331.0,duck,2,0.97,False

With my journal beside me, I began today's entry with those words.
