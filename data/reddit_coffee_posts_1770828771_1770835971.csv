1r25y90,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r25y90/best_ways_to_put_myself_out_there/,Best ways to put myself out there?,"I (20m) have never been in a relationship before. I’ve been out on one real date and a few sort-of-dates, and asked only about 5 girls out.

My life is great otherwise. I’m going to school for engineering, have a great family, awesome group of friends, and have had multiple jobs. Even have a great internship lined up for the summer. I think of myself as pretty attractive, I could work on my posture but I’m 5’10, fit and try to dress pretty well. I’m no charismatic, muscular football business guy, but I have my own car, pay my own way and have lots of good date ideas to take a girl out. I can hold a good conversation too, and go outdoors and travel/do new things all the time.

What’s tough for me is I was homeschooled so missed out on the whole high school dating scene, didn’t even have good friends until I met them in college. I was pretty socially awkward back then, the introverted kid who just worked and did online classes but I've improved since. im trying to be a lot more well rounded, saying yes to everything. My friends tell me I'm really funny and they think i could find a good girl. I didn't think about it as much before but now that I'm 20 it's really hitting me.

I just don't really know how to put myself out there. It's tough because I'm between work and 17 credits of engineering, don't meet many girls on the daily. I've tried the cold approach thing asking for girls' numbers a few times but it just feels weird. My college is more female outside of engineering, I'm joining other clubs to broaden my horizons there but  a lot of girls at my college just don't seem very approachable. I just try to talk to girls in general now when I see them. Want to start talking to the few in my engineering classes and practice complimenting girls in coffee shops I’ll never see again. Some of my friends think I'm being a little desperate, but it seems like if you want to date you need to make an effort, but not too much effort as you'll scare people away?

I was thinking of joining an app or two over the summer and going on a few bad dates just to get the endless thoughts out of my system. 

the other thing is I don't have many female dominated interests. I bike and run, I guess that's something, but other than that I just fix cars, work as much as I can and tinker with engineering type stuff. Like I said I'm not the guy on campus driving a new Bronco and going on vacations all the time but I yearn for the chance to be able to treat a girl well and be there for her.

it’s keeping it basic

toast

At first I thought it was just a normal kids game but when we started playing, the blocks were bigger, heavier and the challenges trickier.



 That moment made me realize how games we grew up with can be adapted to create a fun experience for adults too.

Later while just casually scrolling online marketplaces  including alibaba I noticed Jenga games for adults in many variations. 



Some had oversized wooden blocks. Others came with unique challenges or themed twists. Materials, stability, and design quality varied a lot. It seemed buyers are looking not just for nostalgia but for durability, challenge level  and entertainment value.

That raises a few questions. How much does block weight or size affect difficulty and enjoyment? Do different wood types really change stability or feel? Are themed or challenge versions more fun than classic designs? And how many variations exist that most people never notice because local stores stock only basic sets?





It makes you curious which features actually make adult Jenga challenging, durableand fun. And which subtle details quietly decide whether it becomes a favorite game for gatherings or just another shelf item?",1,1770835674.0,jenga,0,1.0,False

1r25uiu,https://i.redd.it/qqsi9jkltwig1.png,Building Up Iron: Hemochromatosis Mutations,"Hemochromatosis is a disease state of building up too much iron in the body. It can be caused by genetic mutations in iron-related genes, or it can be due to excessive blood transfusions for anemia or liver disease.

The HFE gene was discovered in 1996 and is linked to hereditary hemochromatosis. This gene codes for a protein that **controls how iron is taken into the intestinal cells**. Free iron is bound to transferrin, which binds to a transferrin receptor to be taken into the cell. HFE can also bind to the transferrin receptor, blocking the receptor from taking iron into the cells. In this way, **HFE is a negative regulator of iron absorption.**\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569368/)\] As an iron sensor, HFE controls iron intake and regulates the downstream production of hepcidin.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569368/)\]

When too much iron is absorbed, whether because of a mutation in the HFE gene or other genes regulating iron, the body stores it in different organs. Excess iron causes **oxidative stress and DNA damage** to the tissue. This excess can cause fibrosis and cell death, leading to liver cirrhosis or other organ damage.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6785287/)\]

As you can imagine, the symptoms of iron building up can occur over the decades leading up to the point of organ failure.

**Symptoms** of excess iron include:

* **Joint pain, fatigue, and irritability** are common complaints in people with HFE genetic variants.
* **Fibromyalgia and arthritis** are common diagnoses.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23188073)\]\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25822977)\]
* Reduced libido and **erectile dysfunction** in men are common with iron buildup. \[[ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31636772/)\]
* **Diabetes and heart disease** diagnoses can often precede the clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6785287/)\]

The key here is that all health problems related to **excess iron can be prevented.**

# Give Blood Regularly

If you have slightly elevated iron levels, the simplest way to manage them is to give blood regularly. You will likely feel good, and you will definitely help out someone else with your blood donation. It is a win-win.

Natural Iron Chelators and Inhibitors:

Drinking **tea, coffee, or cocoa** with a meal decreases iron absorption considerably.\[[ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35320401/)\]

**Quercetin**, a flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables, has been studied for its iron-chelating properties.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645657/)\]

**Melatonin** is a natural antioxidant produced by the body in high amounts during the night. It is also essential to preventing oxidative damage in iron overload.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5458235/)\]\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6017920/)\] As we age, we produce less melatonin at night. Additionally, exposure to blue light (electronics, bright overhead lights) in the evening hours also reduces melatonin production.

I haven’t been in such a great relationship before. We met irl, no dating apps or social media, just met organically which was really nice. We’ve had small disagreements which resolve in about a day or less.

We have the same goals in life and have been through a lot together. My friend passed away and he was there, he had a couple family emergencies and I was there, pet passed and he was there, career changes and we’ve been there for each other. We also have a vacation planned together in the summer.

Anyway, for the past couple months I’ve been trying to ask more questions about where we’re headed. I’ve been clear I wanna get married one day and so has he. And we both want kids eventually (wayyy down the road). And the other day we went on a really lovely date and while I was getting ready he was hinting at proposing. I said I love you first at a REALLY awkward moment. And he said he’s trying to think of a way to “get back at me” for that. We have a super playful relationship. On a date I’ll say I’m running to the washroom and secretly pay since 99% of the time he insists on paying. Then he’ll sneak gifts to me when I’m not paying attention. Or he’ll say we should go to the store and he guys me a sweet gift. Or I’ll surprise him with a coffee if he’s having a hard day at work.

I asked how he’s thinking of getting back at me and he said “with a question.” And got nervous. I asked what kind of question and he said it would be a next step in our relationship. I’ve also told him how I want to wait to move in together until after engagement. After more questions I asked him what timeline he has in mind and he said about a year. But with how playful/tricky we are there’s a decent chance he’s planning on a different timeline and he’s trying to not give me too much info yet (not sure).

I’ve known he’s my person since the beginning. He won’t share more details and says if he does he’ll be giving it away and basically asking. And at the end of our conversation I asked for another hint and he said “will you… go to lunch with me?” Like a very long pause.

And at the end of our date I made a crude joke and he said “and that’s how I know you’re the one”

I’m just super type A and obsess about things. So I’m adding to my Pinterest board and getting super excited- but am I reading into it?? Or does it sound like he’s going to propose in the next few months to a year? And if it’s a year I might go insane with excitement lol

I've been a SAHM for 3 years. We have an almost 3 year old and an almost 6 month old. Prior to being a SAHM, I was just a receptionist at a local clinic. I was so grateful to be able to stay home with my kids up until my husband had to go back to work after I had baby #2. And now I'm contemplating reentering the workforce.

I am so mentally & emotionally checked out. I can handle one crying kid at a time, but when the toddler is whining & baby is crying, I can't do it. I'm way more short-tempered and the sad thing is that I know my toddler at least would get better, more positive attention at daycare. I miss having adult interaction. I miss being mentally stimulated. I feel like I work at my own daycare & I do not like it. (No shade to daycare workers on here lol I am just not built for that. Y'all rock 😭) I LOVE my kids obviously, but momma needs a break. I feel so awful for writing that. 

To address a few things I know people might bring up:

1) my husband is amazing & he does what he can to help me. Just today he came home over his lunch to let me run out for a coffee trip by myself. BUT he is currently working a full-time job, a part-time job, AND is in school full time. Lord willing he will finish his degree this May! So I'm like, will I feel differently about staying home after he finishes his degree & has more time to help with the kids? Idk. I don't know if I can make it another 3 months like this. 

2) I do not have PPD. I know that's something someone with PPD might say lol but I promise. I did have PPD with my 1st, and really I don't feel that way at all. When I have kid-free time, I feel like \*myself\* again. It's not like I'm depressed constantly. Just bc a mom needs a break from her kids does not mean she has PPD.

3) we don't have any other help to watch the kids. In fact, we only have 1 car that my husband needs for work 6 days a week, so that complicates things. We do go play outside, but we can't ever leave the house to do stuff like the library, playground, etc. It's quite lonesome & the only time we ever actually leave the house is for church & Aldi 1 day a week.

If you've read this far, thank you. This is not a small decision as it would completely change our routine obviously. We'd also have to purchase a 2nd car so I could get to work. Also, with the cost of daycare, we'd \*barely\*, if at all, be money ahead. We'd basically just be paying for daycare for me to have adult interaction/child-free time & for our kids to have interactions with others. It's not like it would really be an increase financially. 

I also get scared thinking about daycare sicknesses & not being as involved with my children's care as I currently am. So I would love to hear from other moms who have been through this decision before. What did you decide? Did you like or regret your decision? I feel like a terrible mom for needing time away from my kids but I really don't know what else to do at this point. ",1,1770834974.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

2. I ride a motorcycle because sidewalks are for people with no sense of adventure.🏍🔥

3. Fun isn’t something I plan, it just kind of happens when I’m around. Late-night laughs, spontaneous plans, and moments you’ll remember way too clearly.

4. Coffee is not a lifestyle, it's my bloodtype.☕️❤️

5. And when there’s energy left over, you’ll find me at the gym lifting, pushing limits, or just clearing my head.

Other forms of transport like bikes, ebikes, or mopeds aren’t as good. They’re very limited and can’t even take you far and they aren’t as comfortable and walkable cities are not something I want and I can't move I just want a licesne it's not hard to understand

No matter what argument or solution you choose, having a license will always be a million times better. Not having one has ruined my whole life, and it doesn’t feel worth living anymore

I already requested a withdrawal from my university, even though I have a scholarship, but I really don’t care. What’s the point of a degree if you can’t even be independent enough to move around by yourself?

My girlfriend is so annoying. I told her to leave me alone, but she keeps coming back saying things like, “A driving license doesn’t matter to me trust me and stuff like that.

Like what does that have to do with you? This is about me My identity doesn’t revolve around you. I honestly don’t understand what “it doesn’t matter to me” is supposed to mean. If it doesn’t matter to you, fine but it matters to me. I have my own identity

Then she says a driving license isn’t important trust me but I didn’t reply because she already has a license, which means it clearly does matter. That’s why it feels like a lie when she said that

Today she came again asking if we could go out for coffee to talk about it, but I left her on seen because there’s nothing to talk about.

And I don’t care anymore about uni because I’ve spent my last days entirely in bed, and I haven’t gone outside the apartment at all. I’m ready to end it all, and please don’t give basic solutions like walkable cities, buses, or similar thing

1r25c04,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1r25c04/approved_atlanta_fo/,Approved! Atlanta FO,"Approved! After many hours of reading this forum, I’m so happy to finally share that my green card was approved in 4.5 months at the Atlanta Field Office.

**Background:**  
I adjusted my status from F-1 (Post-OPT) to a marriage-based green card. I have been in the U.S. since 2018 as an F-1 student. My record is completely clean: no criminal history, no overstays, no removal proceedings, no unauthorized employment, no prior marriages, no children, no asylum applications—nothing complicated. My case was very straightforward.

I met my now-husband (U.S. citizen) in mid-2023, and we had a court wedding in August 2025.

**Timeline (Concurrent Filing of I-130, I-485, I-765, I-131):**

* PD: September 19, 2025
* Biometrics: October 14, 2025
* Interview Scheduled: January 6, 2026
* Interview Date: February 10th, 2026
* Approval Date: February 11th, 2026

We spent countless hours watching Kseniya International videos and carefully reading all USCIS instructions. We consulted a lawyer for a few basic questions, but we completed and filed everything ourselves. We attended the interview alone, just the two of us.

For every form, we followed the official USCIS instruction PDFs and uploaded/submitted all required documents. We prepared a large amount of evidence to submit online, include in the physical package, and bring to the interview (my binder was heavy smh). I may forget a few items, but here’s what we included:

* Copies of both IDs and passport-style photos
* Copies of both birth certificates
* Copies of all passports (I have dual citizenship, so we included all of them)
* All of my F-1 visas (undergrad and grad), all I-20s, and my latest I-94
* Current joint lease, previous lease, and proof of prior shared addresses before signing a lease together
* Employment verification letters for both of us
* Letters from family
* My husband’s W-2s, 1040s, and state tax returns for 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025
* My W-2s, 1040s and state tax return for 2023, 2024 and 2025
* IRS Tax Return Transcript for 2025 (we filed jointly for the first time in 2025)
* Flight tickets from my husband’s visits to my home country to meet my family
* Screenshots of messages between us
* Other family members' social media posts
* Money transfers between us throughout the 2-year relationship
* Joint health insurance through husband's job
* 401-K beneficary list

Additionally, I created a PowerPoint-style relationship timeline in Canva. It included 44 slides with 4–5 photos per slide, organized chronologically. For each month, I added brief context (2–3 lines) explaining dates, locations, and key events.

On the day of the interview, we arrived 30 minutes early. I accidentally spilled coffee on my shirt and had to throw away my drink because beverages are not allowed inside—so I recommend skipping coffee beforehand (if possible lol). We were called in right on time. The environment was not hostile at all. Although the officer was not overly expressive, they were professional and pleasant to speak with.

**Interview Experience:**  
At the beginning, they asked us individually for our full names, dates of birth, Real IDs,  SSN and our passports.

Most of the relationship questions were directed to both of us. They asked when and how we met, when we started dating, our marriage date, and whether anyone was present as a witness at our court wedding. They also asked about some of the previous addresses that we had submitted proof for. She asked the latest date I had entered the USA and if it was through F-1. Asked husband what was my major in school and where I worked.

They asked me when I knew I loved my husband (sweet). I was asked my husband’s parents’ names, and he was asked my parents’ names. They asked whether I have family in the U.S. and whether all of my husband’s family lives in Georgia. They also asked if I had met his family and if he had met mine.

My husband is shy and not a man of many words. Instead of explaining how he had met my entire family — including traveling with me to my home country and the fact that my family visited us last year — he gave a very short answer. I obviously said something because why on earth and we ended up lightly bickering right there in the office lol

After that, the officer went through the standard I-485 yes/no questions with me.

We did not receive verbal approval at the end of the interview. We left with that white post-interview paper with first option marked. However, I asked about a potential name change, and the officer mentioned that it would be easier to do it during the naturalization process. In my slightly delusional mind, I took that as a small positive sign.

The I-130 was approved shortly after the interview, and the I-485 was approved today.

I decided to do that because I was severely burned out and I had just finished my degree so I wanted to go back to my home country and rest, and both my parents supported my decision. But now, I’ve been living here for 2,5 months so far and the way their house is so cluttered, messy (and even dirty in some ways) is really bothering me. Since living on my own I developed cleaning habits that are really important to me, and the state that my living environment is affects a lot my mental health.

Both my parents work long hours, plus I have a 12y/o sibling so they have the extra demand to take care of him. I have been saying that I don’t expect them to clean the house everyday, like mop the floors or vacuum or even do the dishes. I just asked them to try and change this habit of leaving clutter (and sometimes even trash) around the house. Empty beer cans and coffee mugs everywhere, used socks on the floor, everything and anything is just left wherever, for days on end without being put away or thrown in the trash.

They say I’m right and that they should be more organized. Then they spend one entire day cleaning a room but because they don’t change the everyday habits that room is filled with clutter and looks super messy in less than a week. It affects me more because I work from home so I’m around this all day.

AITA for insisting they do something? I feel a bit guilty because I know they work so much, and often are super tired from their routine so I didn’t want to be another demand in their plate but my mental health has been deteriorating in this environment. Let me know your thoughts pls

edit: I am paying rent and groceries and because I work from home most of the cleaning and sometimes the cooking is also done by me (also because my job has flexible hours), and I'm also the one in charge of picking my sibling from school and extracurricular activities half of the week!

On a side-but-related note, there are about **47× more SPX tokens than BTC coins**, so **1 BTC ≈ 47 SPX in scarcity terms**.

Which means if **21 million people each owned 47 SPX**, the entire SPX supply would be taken, just like **21 million people owning 1 BTC** would take all Bitcoin.

SPX holders already own **approximately 70%** of the supply already. Supply squeeze = **astronomical parabolas** when the market plays nicely again - and it will - because there **won't be enough supply to meet demand**. 

**Buying 47 SPX today**, in terms of **relative development stage**, is *analogous* to buying **1 BTC when it was trading between roughly $190–$750 in 2013**.

**BTC paved the way for SPX** to accomplish its scale **much faster**, as is the **exponential way.** Thanks BTC. And welcome Maxis. It's been nice getting to know you.

1r252it,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1r252it/the_science_behind_why_winning_feels_so_damn_good/,The Science Behind Why Winning Feels So Damn Good And How to Hack It,"Ever notice how some people just seem to radiate confidence? They walk into a room and you can feel it. Meanwhile the rest of us are spiraling over a text that was left on read for 3 hours. Here's the thing though, that confident energy isn't magic. It's neurochemistry. And after going down a massive rabbit hole through neuroscience research, psychology podcasts, and way too many studies on human behavior, I realized we're all basically walking chemistry sets. The good news? You can actually influence the recipe.

Society loves to tell us confidence is something you're born with. That's complete bullshit. What we call ""winning energy"" is literally just your brain releasing the right cocktails of chemicals at the right times. And once you understand how these systems work, you can start gaming them. Not in a fake it til you make it way, but by actually rewiring your neural pathways through specific behaviors.

**1. testosterone isn't just about muscles, it's about presence**

Testosterone gets a bad rep because people associate it with aggro gym bros. But this hormone is actually crucial for assertiveness, risk taking, and what researchers call ""approach behavior."" Both men and women produce it, and higher baseline levels correlate with increased confidence and reduced social anxiety.

Here's where it gets interesting. A study from Harvard showed that power posing (standing in expansive positions for 2 minutes) actually increased testosterone by 20% and decreased cortisol (stress hormone) by 25%. Your body language literally changes your brain chemistry. So before any situation where you need to show up confidently, spend 2 minutes in a bathroom stall doing a power pose. Feels ridiculous but the science is solid.

Another hack: winning itself increases testosterone. This is called the ""winner effect."" Even small victories create an upward spiral. Start stacking tiny wins daily. Finished that annoying email? Win. Went to the gym? Win. Your brain doesn't distinguish between big and small victories at the chemical level.

**2. dopamine is the motivation molecule you're probably depleting**

Dopamine doesn't actually create pleasure, it creates wanting. It's the chemical that makes you pursue goals. Problem is, we're living in a dopamine crisis. Social media, porn, junk food, they all spike dopamine artificially and desensitize your receptors. You're basically breaking the system that's supposed to make you feel motivated to pursue real goals.

Dr. Andrew Huberman talks about this extensively on his podcast. He explains that dopamine baseline matters more than dopamine peaks. If you're constantly chasing artificial spikes, your baseline drops, which means you feel less motivated during normal life. This is why scrolling Instagram for an hour makes you feel like shit and unable to start that project.

The fix: dopamine detox isn't about going monk mode for 30 days. It's about being strategic. Before doing any difficult task, don't spike your dopamine with coffee, music, or checking your phone. Let your baseline dopamine be what drives you. After you complete the task, then reward yourself. You're training your brain to associate effort with dopamine release, not instant gratification.

Also cold exposure. Insanely effective for increasing baseline dopamine. A study showed cold water immersion increased dopamine by 250% for several hours. That's why successful people are obsessed with cold showers. It's not a flex, it's brain hacking.

**3. serotonin and the status game you didn't know you were playing**

Serotonin regulates mood and social behavior. Low serotonin correlates with depression and social withdrawal. High serotonin correlates with feelings of significance and belonging. Here's the kicker: your brain is constantly monitoring your social status, and that directly impacts serotonin levels.

When you feel respected or accomplished, serotonin increases. When you feel disrespected or like a failure, it drops. This is partly why social media is so toxic, you're constantly comparing yourself to highlight reels, which tanks your perceived status and thus your serotonin.

Practical moves: stop comparing yourself to people 10 steps ahead. Instead, track your own progress. Keep a wins journal where you write down 3 things you accomplished each day, no matter how small. This trains your brain to recognize your own status improvements rather than external validation.

The book ""The Molecule of More"" by[ Daniel Lieberman](https://heb.fas.harvard.edu/people/daniel-e-lieberman) is absolutely fascinating on this. It breaks down how dopamine (future focused) and serotonin (present focused) work together. Lieberman explains why chronically ambitious people often feel empty, they're all dopamine no serotonin. You need both. Chase goals but also practice gratitude for what you have now.

Exercise also boosts serotonin significantly. Not just because of the physical benefits but because completing a workout is a status signal to your own brain that you're the type of person who takes care of themselves.

**4. oxytocin and why connection is not optional**

Oxytocin is the bonding chemical. Released during physical touch, meaningful conversation, even eye contact. It reduces anxiety and increases trust. People who are chronically lonely have dysregulated oxytocin systems, which makes them more anxious in social situations, which makes them more isolated. Brutal feedback loop.

The solution isn't complicated but it requires action. Physical touch is huge. If you have a partner, hug for at least 20 seconds (that's when oxytocin actually releases). If you don't, get a massage, play with a pet, anything involving touch. Humans literally need this.

Also deep conversations. Surface level small talk doesn't release oxytocin but vulnerable, authentic connection does. Want a more structured way to actually internalize all this neuroscience? [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)is a personalized learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create custom audio content based on your specific goals. You can tell it something like ""I'm struggling with social anxiety and want to understand the neurochemistry behind confidence,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan just for you, complete with adjustable depth (10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives) and different voice options. It's basically designed to turn all these concepts into actual behavior change instead of just information you forget.

**5. cortisol is the silent killer of confidence**

Chronic stress keeps cortisol elevated, which shrinks your hippocampus (memory center), kills neurons, and keeps you in a constant state of threat detection. You can't radiate winning energy when your nervous system thinks you're running from a tiger 24/7.

Stress management isn't optional, it's foundational. Meditation, breathwork, sufficient sleep, all the boring stuff actually matters. The Insight Timer app has guided meditations specifically for stress reduction. Not woo woo stuff, just practical nervous system regulation.

Sleep is non negotiable. One night of bad sleep increases cortisol significantly and decreases testosterone. If you're trying to optimize your neurochemistry but sleeping 5 hours a night, you're pissing in the wind.

**6. the compounding effect nobody talks about**

Here's what's wild. These systems all interact. High cortisol suppresses testosterone and dopamine production. Low serotonin makes you more stress reactive which spikes cortisol. It's all connected. This means you can create vicious cycles or virtuous cycles.

Start small. Pick one thing: cold showers every morning for dopamine, power posing before important moments for testosterone, daily exercise for serotonin, 8 hours of sleep for cortisol management. Stack one habit at a time. Your neurochemistry will literally change over weeks.

The book ""Behave"" by [Robert Sapolsky](https://profiles.stanford.edu/robert-sapolsky) goes deep into how biology and environment interact to shape behavior. Sapolsky is a Stanford neuroendocrinology professor and he makes this super digestible. This book will make you question everything you think you know about human nature and free will. Genuinely perspective shifting.

Look, nobody is walking around with perfect neurochemistry. We're all slightly broken chemistry sets trying to function in a world that wasn't designed for our stone age brains. But understanding the mechanics gives you leverage. You can't control everything but you can influence way more than you think.

The people who seem naturally confident? They're probably not. They've just accidentally or deliberately created habits that optimize their neurochemistry. Now you can do it deliberately.",1,1770833935.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

Findom is transactional by nature, but never has it felt SO transactional. I won't pretend that Findom used to be some delicate art or the like, but currently I can't help but feel that it is almost devoid of intamacy.

Of course there are plenty of dommes and subs who have found otherwise; trusted bonds or dynamics that have evolved over time beyond this. But if you're stepping into Findom today or recently, I've gotta admit it looks BLEAK.

Dommes seemingly want far more for less. Many (including myself) have argued that initials and faster-paced findom in the earlier stages of an interaction exists because of how flakey/time wasting some subs can be. But at a certain point, it's as though we're setting up these dynamics to burn out extremely quickly. 

Warped expectations are everywhere. I'm sure those payment app screenshots with back to back sends of $20, €30, $50 sends look mighty nice, but I'm quite confident that more often than not, if we were flies on the wall while this ""incredibly hot drain 🥵"" was going down, the most we'd see is something like:

""Again""
""More 🤭""
""Double it 🤪""
""Mm good :))))""

Not intense, not interesting. Just a race to run you out of your paycheck into a ""see you next week"" style dismissal.

NOT ALL findom is like this, i KNOW. But this has been a growing trend.

So who's to blame? Why, it's those greedy dommes of cou- EHH NOPE, it's us. It's the subs that vote with their dicks instead of their wallets.

If a snobby café opens in town and says ""hey, we're gonna charge $200 for our speciality strawberry/vanilla matcha - our they the bozos for charging that much? Or is it the FREAKS that consistently pay too much for something not worth it?

I've quit Findom, so it means nothing to me at this point. But if this behaviour feels as common in this space to you as it did to me, might be worth taking a second to think ""yeah, she IS really hot, but is she $300 for a ""good boy"" and a picture of her middle finger hot?"".

1r24uao,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating4winners/comments/1r24uao/how_to_make_a_lasting_impression_on_women/,How to Make a Lasting Impression on Women,"Most men approach women the wrong way: by complimenting what’s obvious, over-explaining themselves, or reacting to every test. A strong first impression isn’t about flattery.   
It’s about presence, subtlety, and control.   
Women notice men who don’t just follow the predictable script.

**1. Never Comment on Looks First**

It’s tempting to point out her beauty. Don’t. Doing so signals one thing immediately: you’re evaluating her. And she already knows she’s attractive. This puts her in “exit mode” if she doesn’t feel drawn to you instantly. Your goal is differentiation, not validation.

**Rule:** She knows she’s beautiful. You don’t need to state the obvious.

**2. Observe the Unnoticed**

When you choose to comment, focus on something unique, something others miss. Maybe it’s the way she laughs, an odd detail about her style, or a subtle energy she radiates. Rare, specific observations signal intelligence and attention to detail.

**Example:** A while ago I met a woman at a coffee shop. Her **hazel eyes** were striking, (genuinely beautiful and rare by the way)  but I didn’t mention them. Everyone notices her eyes. Instead, I engaged in playful banter about our surroundings and hobbies. The interaction wasn’t about her looks, it was about the experience. That’s what made it memorable.

**3. Lead, Don’t Chase**

A good conversation is a dance, not a monologue. Offer value through stories, insights, humor, and teasing. Know when to speak and when to listen. Silence is often more powerful than words. Don’t wait for her to guide the interaction; take the lead with confidence.

**Pro Tip:** Always bring something interesting to the table. A unique perspective or a sharp observation elevates you above every other man she’s spoken to that day.

**4. Never Over-Qualify Yourself**

Self-promotion is obvious. Confidence isn’t loud, it’s implicit. If something impressive arises in conversation, state it matter-of-factly. Avoid hedging, explaining, or justifying. Your credibility comes from calm authority, not from selling yourself.

**5. Hold space for her / allow her to acclimate** 

Women will test you. Snarky remarks, teasing, or subtle challenges are opportunities, not threats. Treat them like friendly banter. Respond with calm wit or playful deflection. Overreacting destroys authority; composure reinforces it.

**Key:** Respond as if she’s a peer, not a prize. Your presence, not your words alone, signals value.

**6. The Art of Absence in Speech**

Sometimes what you *don’t* say is more powerful than what you do. Avoid commentary on what’s expected. Avoid following predictable social scripts. Instead, create curiosity. Silence, selective commentary, and subtle observation generate intrigue.

**Example:** During that same coffee shop encounter, I noticed her energy and attentiveness. I never complimented her looks. Instead, I highlighted quirks and shared stories. By sidestepping clichés, I positioned myself as rare, confident, and interesting.

**Putting it all together**

First impressions aren’t about compliments or rehearsed lines, they’re about how you move the conversation. Notice what others overlook, speak when it matters, and let your calm confidence guide the interaction. Don’t compete for attention; create a dynamic where she’s curious, engaged, and entertained. Do this consistently, and you don’t just get her attention, you make her remember you.",1,1770833450.0,dating4winners,0,1.0,False
1r24tic,https://www.reddit.com/r/needarecipe/comments/1r24tic/chicken_mushroom_adobo_w_roasted_garlic_and/,Chicken & Mushroom Adobo w/ Roasted Garlic and Szechuan Peppercorn,"Ingredients:

* 2 chicken thighs and 2 drumsticks
* 1 carton of mushrooms, I used a mix of shiitake and oyster mushrooms, sliced or torn into strips
* 2/3 cup soy sauce
* 3/4 cup cane vinegar
* 1 cup water
* 1 tbsp black peppercorns
* 1 tbsp Szechuan peppercorns
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 heads of garlic, one peeled, one roasted in an oven for 30 minutes at 350 (an easy way to do this is to cut the top off of the head, exposing just the top of the cloves, and wrap in tin foil with a drizzle of olive oil).
* 2 shallots sliced
* 3 bay leaves
* 4 knobs of palm sugar, or 1/4 cup brown sugar (you can find palm sugar at most asian grocery stores; it provides more caramel notes than other alternatives, and it’s a staple in Southeast and South Asian food)
* 1 tbsp fish sauce
* 1 pinch of MSG

Preparation:

Start by roasting one head of garlic per the instructions above, while heating a large, dry saucepan or wok over medium heat. Add your mushrooms without any oil to “dry fry them.” Dry-frying allows the mushrooms to leech some of their natural moisture; skipping this step often leads to mushrooms that soak up oil when cooked, becoming flabby instead of crisp and Maillard. Once the mushrooms visibly weep water and begin to brown, add about 2 tbsp of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Continue cooking over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, until browned and crisp\*. Remove your shrooms before adding your chicken, skin-side down, and give it plenty of time to develop a nice golden color. Don’t touch it for the first couple of minutes until the skin naturally releases. It shouldn’t stick due to the grease already in the pan, but if it does, it should release as the chicken fat renders. If you don’t use a wok, you may need to do this in batches so the chicken doesn’t steam and the skin develops good color. Once browned, flip and add your shallot and peeled garlic cloves. By this time, your roasted garlic should be ready. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a while before handling (I suggest wearing disposable gloves when handling the head of roasted garlic unless you want your fingers to smell like New Jersey for a week).

In a separate pan, toast your black and Szechuan peppercorns until fragrant, then add half to the wok with the bay leaves, and grind the other half in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. If you don’t have either of these, a hand grinder works too, or even a plastic bag and a heavy pot for crushing. At this point, I add most of the roasted garlic cloves to the vessel I’m crushing the peppercorns in, then mix them before adding them to the wok with the reserved mushrooms from earlier.

At this point, once the shallots and garlic have cooked for a few minutes, add in your vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, and water. Make sure your chicken is submerged at least 2/3 of the way to properly braise. Bring this to a boil for 3 minutes before adding your palm sugar and reducing the heat to a gentle simmer, cooking for up to 40 minutes (eek, I know, putting time into a dish, I’m sorry, but for me, cooking is therapeutic and I’m always willing to put in the extra time for a more satisfying product). Every 10 minutes or so, stir the mixture and flip the chicken to ensure even cooking.

During the braising period, I suggest making a pot of white rice and whatever vegetables you would want to serve. I had leftover asparagus that worked well with the meal in a pinch. In a mood for garlic rice, I set aside a few of the roasted garlic cloves and stirred them into the rice when I fluffed it at the end of cooking.

Once everything is cooked and the sauce has thickened to your liking, you can assemble a plate with a bed of rice, your chicken, and plenty of mushrooms, ladling the sauce over as it soaks into the rice, creating a rich, tangy, peppery gravy. In the Philippines, this excess sauce, spooned over rice, is called *sabaw*, and if it didn’t spike blood pressure, I’d sip on this comforting elixir as if it were my morning coffee.

Once your chicken is tender and your sauce is thickened, sticky, and oh-so-delicious, plate it over a bed of your hot roasted garlic rice, with optional vegetables and plenty of that braising liquid. This meal, if you don’t finish it all on your own, makes great leftovers, as the sauce will only deepen in flavor as it marinates in the fridge.

\*In other applications, this could be taken even further to make crispy, addictive mushrooms that can be eaten on their own or as a topping for this recipe or others. In this recipe, we want them to develop a deep, caramelized, roasted flavor while soaking up that braising liquid and achieving a chewier, buoyant texture.

He says he'll just not go if I'm not okay with it but I told him that just go as he already said yes. I said that because I feel like I'm just jealous and overreacting. I also asked that what if it's the other way around, would he allow me to go to a cafe full of butler or men playing characters? And he said he's fine with it.

1r24tap,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1r24tap/i_dont_want_to_give_up/,I don't want to give up,"This is a medical rant ig and as a warning, my english is my second language so bear with me, also, feel free to correct me on my vocabulary or the way I speak since it will help me.

 Growing up, my family hasn't had good insurance since I have a single mom who doesn't have papers. We've always struggled with money, and I started working at the age of 14 under the table. I am 23-year-old female now and things have changed drastically in the worst way. Not being able to afford anything isn't new to me and I've always had good insurance when it came to getting my SSRI and stuff, so I don't have to pay anything since I have Medicare my whole life even if I am working or not. Anyways, the lack of dental work has finally caught up to me and my siblings. My mom never worried about hers since she's had braces and retainers when she was a teenager, which I envy. 

My teeth are crooked from crowding and having a small jaw/mouth. I've always grinded my teeth from stress and bad anxiety which is probably what made it worse. About 4 years ago when I was flossing, my back tooth broke a bit and ever since its just decayed. now I have a hole in my tooth that ive been compacting with that white dental clay that you use for dentures and it really helps but what's the point when my molar is growing in, breaking my tooth even more. Yes, dental hygiene is important and I took care of my teeth the best I can and even though we were broke, my mom never allowed us to drink coke or any of those crazy died sodas. I also can't drink coffee because i take stimulant for ADHD so my teeth are fairly white... but crooked. If I could explain it, I have overcrowding and my tooth pokes out like Zendaya, other than that its all on the bottom where i have the issues.

Teeth are very important first impression and mine hurt and I am also worried. I feel like I'm too young to have tooth decay and it's very frustrating to the point where I am thinking about changing my whole major to dentistry just to afford it and help other for free or even at a shockingly low price, like 50 bucks. I am going to school full time btw and chose arguably the worst major as a psychiatrist which takes 8 years since you aren't recognizable unless you have a master's in it.

The beans should have been roasted this month, so they are VERY fresh. 

At this point I should also note that this is my first hands on experience with fresh coffee at home, previously only thing I had was instant coffee. 

I tried a 70/30 Arabica/Robusta Blend today and the results were… well… not good.

Tried following some generell advice I’ve found online and started with a Setting 8 grind - No flow at all. 

Till Grind 11 there was no liquid passing the puck at all. Which is a bit coarse for espresso I’ve heard. 

At Grind 17 I got 49 OUT but fairly uneven and although better still fairly harsh. 

At this point I’m not sure if the grinder on my machine sucks or if the beans are still too fresh or it’s user error. 

The pre-ground Decaf (100% Arabica) I got which should be also freshly roasted this month, tastes way better and extracts fairly well. 

18 IN 48 OUT but even flow over the brewing process.

I spent years thinking I had to either bare my soul to connect with people or stay completely guarded. Both sucked. Then I discovered this concept through Mark Manson's work and conversations with therapists on podcasts, and it completely changed how I build relationships.

Society sells us two extremes. Either you're the stoic who never shows weakness, or you're the therapy-speak robot who trauma dumps on first dates. The truth? Strategic vulnerability is what actually builds trust without making you a doormat. It's not about spilling your guts. It's about knowing what to share, when, and with whom.

**The psychology behind strategic vulnerability**

Brené Brown's research shows vulnerability creates connection, but there's a catch most people miss. Vulnerability without boundaries isn't courage, it's just poor judgment. Dr. Henry Cloud talks about this in ""Boundaries"" (bestselling psychologist, literally wrote THE book on healthy relationships, insanely practical). He breaks down how trust is built incrementally, not instantly. You don't hand someone your entire emotional history because they bought coffee.

The concept is simple: share something real but measured, watch how they handle it, then calibrate. If they respond with empathy and reciprocate, you can share more. If they weaponize it or dismiss it, you've learned everything you need to know while risking very little.

**What selective vulnerability actually looks like**

Instead of ""I have crippling anxiety and my therapist says I have attachment issues,"" try ""I get pretty anxious before big presentations, working on managing that better."" Same honesty, way less ammunition for manipulation. You're being real without handing over your entire psychological blueprint.

Another example: ""I struggled after my last breakup"" hits different than a 40 minute monologue about your ex on a second date. The first invites connection. The second screams unprocessed trauma.

For anyone looking to go deeper on building better social skills but doesn't know where to start, BeFreed might be worth checking out. It's a personalized learning app that pulls from books like ""Boundaries"" by Dr. Henry Cloud, research papers on attachment theory, and insights from relationship experts to create tailored audio content based on your specific goals. 

You can type something like ""I'm naturally reserved and want to learn how to be more open without oversharing in social situations,"" and it'll generate a customized learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The content comes from vetted sources, books, expert talks, research, so it's all science-backed. Plus you can pause mid-episode to ask your AI coach questions or get clarification on anything. Makes the whole process way more practical than just reading theory.

**Why this works better than traditional advice**

Most self help advice treats vulnerability like an on/off switch. Either you're ""authentic"" and share everything or you're ""fake"" and share nothing. Real life doesn't work that way. Strategic vulnerability recognizes that trust is earned through pattern recognition, not grand gestures.

Dr. John Gottman's research (the guy who can predict divorce with 90% accuracy, no joke) shows that successful relationships involve ""bids for connection"" that start small and build over time. You don't propose marriage on the first date. You don't share your deepest trauma with your coworker. You test the waters, see who shows up, then decide how much deeper to go.

**The edge you keep**

Here's the uncomfortable truth: some people will use your vulnerability against you. Narcissists, manipulators, generally shitty humans. They're scanning for weaknesses. If you give them everything upfront, you're defenseless when they inevitably turn on you.

Keeping strategic means you maintain discernment. You're not cynical or paranoid, just smart. The right people will appreciate your honesty without needing your entire backstory. The wrong people will reveal themselves before you've given them enough to hurt you with.

Think of it like showing your cards in poker. You want to reveal just enough to keep people engaged, but not so much that you lose your advantage. The people worth keeping around will respect that you have boundaries. The ones who get mad you won't trauma dump immediately were probably looking to exploit you anyway.

**The practical application**

Start conversations with ""I've been thinking about..."" instead of ""So my therapist says..."" Share your values before your vulnerabilities. Talk about what you're working toward before what you're running from. The depth comes naturally with the right people, and you never have to force it with the wrong ones.

The goal isn't to be calculating or fake. It's to be intentional about who gets access to what parts of you. That's not walls, that's wisdom. You can be genuinely open while still maintaining healthy boundaries. That's actually what emotional maturity looks like.",2,1770833260.0,MenLevelingUp,0,1.0,False

1r24p5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uganda/comments/1r24p5r/the_ugandan_age_of_opportunity_lets_discuss/,The Ugandan Age of Opportunity? Let's discuss?,"I believe this is the greatest time in history to be a Ugandan youth. We have soo much free information online we can use to become successful and wealthy. 

I am not wealthy but I have changed my mindset from being angry with the system to actually trying to understand how it works. Where is the Smart Money going? What are the governments spending priorities for the next 5 years? 

People always abuse the President on here but almost every speech he makes he tells people what to do? The National Development Plan NDP IV is publicly available online for you to read, the NRM Manifesto, countless interviews and speeches etc.

To make it simple for you there are 5 key sectors that the government is investing in and almost weekly advises Ugandans to invest in 

1. High Value Agriculture (Livestock and Crops)

Both for domestic consumption and export. Did you know Uganda exports improved rabbit breeds to the DRC? Uganda has a young population and come rain or shine Ugandans need to eat all kinds of animals. Do you know how many people in Rural areas are making millions selling milk, meat and animals to people in Kampala and other urban areas? Many started with just 1m from PDM. Have not even mentioned high value crops like coffee, cocoa, vanilla etc.

Ok fine maybe you don't have access to land or fear quarrels with family in the village. Why not focus on value addition or market linkages. Imagine connecting the farmers in your village to buyers in Kampala, maybe transporting the produce and taking a commission. They already suffer with middlemen who buy cheaply and sell in Kampala but here you are the broker and you can earn well.

Why not get a few friends together and have an investment group and own your own factory or small processing company? 100k Per month for 20 people is 2 m. In 5 months you have 10m Enough to rent a space and begin processing and packaging things for export or even making your own products. 

A bucket of Mangoes in Teso sometimes costs 2k just 2k a full bucket. How difficult is it to invest and make some kind of organic, mango juice and partner with gyms?

2. Mineral Development 

The government has a policy of no exporting any raw mineral in Uganda. Uganda is also a transit route for Gold and other precious stones and these things are also mined in Uganda. Why not start a small scale jewelry company. Or make arts and crafts using a bit of gold or a bit of precious stones that are cheaper like amethyst etc that are being mined in Elgon or Kigezi or Karamoja etc? If i mention being a broker you will say scammer so i wont speak about the gap of being a trusted broker in the Ugandan Mineral Sector. I know a Kenyan Woman who started in 2016 and is now a Specialist Advisor for Mineral Investors in East Africa she succeeded because she was honest and would warn investors when there was a scam now she has built working relationships from Washington DC all the way to Beijing.

3. Sustainable Tourism

Many tourists who come to Uganda have already seen the big 5 animals, they have already been to many better national parks in Africa. Maybe they have already gone to Rwanda and seen the Mountain gorillas there but what they want is ""What new unique thing can Uganda offer?"" 

I once met some American lady who was travelling around Uganda by bus. She told me how she spent 12 hours on a bus all the way to Karamoja just to experience sleeping in a Karimojong village. She spoke of how she and other tourists liked the tour company offering that package because 40%-60% of tour proceeds were put in Community Savings accounts which would take children from that community to school.

We are seeing Marathons, Cycling races, endurance races etc targeting adventure tourists who are an increasing population of global tourists. 

If you stay in an area where tourists frequent, why not start a project like this?

4. ICT

I cannot forget my tech bros and tech sisters. The government has invested heavily in Cross-Country ICT infrastructure, we have much higher internet speeds than we used to and thanks to competition prices are much more affordable than before. Fine they may not be the best but this has made life easier. 

I know someone who set up his own public wifi network in some random district outside Kampala and he charges just 2k per day per person and he earns enough to just follow his passions. 

With AI and other tools it is now the easiest time to develop apps and programs that solve real world challenges. We have soo many schools in Uganda. Who wants to vibe code or actually code, high quality custom built apps for schools and students to revise or study. Or even School Information Management Systems. Maybe even for Private Universities?

So many people are focusing on fintech but what about Agri-tech, Community Engagement Tech etc.

We have some of the best ICT people in Uganda some of them are working for big global companies online and i am excited to see them unleash their full potential.

5. Services

Things like Restaurants, Saloons, Banking and lending (microfinance). If you are in this sector I encourage you to study the best brands in the world on your phone, whether from google search, youtube, tiktok or instagram. Follow these companies. Find out what they are doing, how they do it? What you can learn from them? How you can apply it to Uganda? If you can do that you are instantly in the top 95% of businesses because you are offering a level of service that is not in Uganda.

With Alibaba, Ali Express, Amazon etc all those things like LED Lights small small quality finishings and things that make a business look unique can be ordered very cheaply. 

 Conclusion

The government is investing very heavily in these 5 sectors and the wealthy Ugandan Elite are also wisely positioning themselves in these sectors. Don't be worried about competition because Uganda has 50 million people and doubling every 25 years iirc. The market is too big for us. 

If you can outlearn, out evolve and out serve your competition at a fair price then thats 90% of the work right there

I heard the advice to 'be a contributor first' but didn't know what that meant quantitatively. So I set a goal: For every 1 post I make in a community, I must make 10 genuine, helpful comments on other people's posts in that same community.

This forced me to actually read, think, and add value without any agenda. It changed my relationship with the platform completely. I stopped seeing it as a megaphone and started seeing it as a coffee shop.

The unexpected benefit? When I did eventually post something of my own, a few people recognized my username from helpful comments and were more inclined to engage. It built a tiny bit of social capital.

The 10:1 ratio is arbitrary, but the principle is sound. You have to earn the right to ask for attention.

What's your balance between giving and asking on Reddit? Have you found a ratio or rule that keeps your participation feeling authentic?

I was fifteen. I'd lived in that room since I was seven. My stepdad stood behind her with his arms crossed, smirking like he'd just won something. She said I could sleep on the couch in the living room. When I asked where I was supposed to keep my clothes, she handed me two plastic bins and said to figure it out.

The baby wasn't even born yet. She was six months pregnant.

I asked if this was temporary, like until they moved to a bigger place or something. My stepdad laughed and said ""this IS the bigger place."" Three bedrooms. One for them, one for the baby, one for his home office where he kept his gaming setup. My mom said I'd be fine, that plenty of kids would be grateful to even have a couch.

I slept on that couch for two years.

I kept my clothes in those bins under the coffee table. I did my homework at the kitchen counter after they went to bed because the living room was ""family space"" and I wasn't allowed to spread my stuff around during the day. I woke up whenever the baby cried, which was constantly, because the living room shared a wall with the nursery. I couldn't have friends over. I couldn't close a door. I couldn't exist anywhere without someone walking through.

My mom acted like I was being dramatic when I got quiet. My stepdad made comments about how I should be helping more with the baby since I ""lived there for free."" I was sixteen years old taking care of my brother at 2am so they could sleep, then going to school on four hours of rest.

I started staying late at the library. Joined every club that met after school. Anything to not be home. My grades were already good, but I became obsessed with them. Perfect scores. Extra credit. I applied to every scholarship I could find.

Senior year, I got a full ride to a state school four hours away. Full tuition, housing, meal plan, everything. I was valedictorian. My mom wanted me to mention the family in my speech. I thanked my teachers instead.

I moved out three days after graduation. Took my bins, my clothes, my laptop, and left. My mom cried and said I was being cruel, that I was abandoning my baby brother. I told her he could have the couch when he got older.

I didn't come home for Thanksgiving. Or Christmas. Or spring break. They called sometimes. I didn't answer much. My brother was growing up and I barely knew him, but that wasn't my fault and I didn't feel guilty about it.

I graduated college, got a good job in another city, started building an actual life. I had my own apartment. My own bedroom. A door that locked. I slept in a real bed for the first time in years and cried like an idiot.

Ten years went by. I'm doing well. My brother is seventeen now, same age I was when I left.

Last month my mom called from a number I didn't recognize. I picked up by accident. She said they needed to talk about my brother. He was failing most of his classes. Barely showed up to school. She was worried he wouldn't graduate. She'd tried everything, grounding him, taking his phone, nothing worked.

Then she asked if I could come home on weekends to tutor him. She said he looked up to me, that I was so smart and such a good student, and maybe I could get through to him. She said it would mean so much to the family.

I asked where he was sleeping. She paused and said in his room, obviously. I asked which room. She said the same one, the one next to theirs, why.

I asked where my stepdad's office was now. Another pause. She said he still used that room.

So I told her I'd think about her offer and get back to her. She sounded hopeful.

I called her back two days later and said no. She asked why not. I said my brother could use the couch if he needed a quiet place to study. She didn't understand at first. I explained that if the couch was good enough for me during high school while pulling a 4.0 and applying to colleges, it should be fine for him.

She lost it. Started screaming about how I was being petty and holding a grudge and punishing an innocent kid for something that wasn't his fault. I stayed calm. I told her she was right, it wasn't his fault. It was hers.

My stepdad grabbed the phone and called me an ungrateful bitch. Said they gave me a roof over my head and food and I owed them. I asked if he still had his gaming setup in that third bedroom. He hung up.

My mom has called me seventeen times since then. My extended family is blowing up my phone saying I'm cruel and heartless. My aunt said I'm punishing a child for my parents' mistakes. A cousin told me to be the bigger person.

But I didn't make my brother live on a couch. I didn't prioritize a home office over my kid's bedroom. And I don't owe them anything just because we share DNA.

My brother sent me a message yesterday. Just said ""I get it."" I don't know if that makes it better or worse.

AITA for saying no?

It never forgets data and can plan an entire campaign while you’re still deciding what coffee to drink. That’s exactly what agentic Ai is bringing to healthcare and pharmaceutical marketing right now. And yes, it’s huge.



What’s Happening?  

A new report shows that agentic Ai could generate up to $450 billion in value by 2028 through increased revenue and cost savings. Unlike traditional Ai, which just answers questions, agentic systems can execute tasks independently, analyze huge amounts of data, and make strategic decisions. Think less “assistant” and more “digital employee.” Healthcare companies are already exploring how these systems can:  

\- analyze customer data automatically  

\- personalize marketing strategies  

\- generate sales insights  

\- plan outreach campaigns  

\- recommend next actions  



And the best part? It all happens in minutes.



How It Works (Simple Version)  

Picture a pharma sales rep preparing for a client meeting.  

Before agentic Ai, they search emails, reports, databases, and CRM systems manually.  

After agentic Ai, the Ai gathers all the data, analyzes behavior, creates a strategy, and even recommends follow-up actions automatically. It combines:  

\- past conversations  

\- customer preferences  

\- engagement data  

\- research trends  

\- recommended messaging  



All into one smart plan. Basically, it’s a superbrain for marketing.



Why This Matters for You  

Here’s the real question: if big companies use autonomous Ai to increase profits, how can you use it to make money? Opportunities are everywhere:  

\- Ai consulting for businesses  

\- data-driven marketing services  

\- Ai content creation  

\- Ai-powered campaign management  

\- automation solutions for companies  



The businesses that learn early win early. The rest watch from the sidelines.



Remember when Excel formulas felt advanced? Now Ai builds strategies, predicts outcomes, and runs workflows. Somewhere, spreadsheets are feeling nervous.



Experts say agentic Ai needs clean, reliable data and human oversight to work properly. So no, robots are not fully replacing humans yet. But they are becoming powerful partners.

1r24kbt,https://l.smartnews.com/p-78UkPar6/lROjSO,Maryland Paramedic Charged With 23 Counts After Allegedly Contaminating Workplace Items,"A Maryland paramedic is facing 23 criminal charges after prosecutors allege he urinated in various areas at his workplace, including a pot of chili, in Towson.

According to WSFA, Christopher Carroll, 36, worked with the Baltimore County Fire Department and allegedly filmed himself leaving bodily fluids in several locations while wearing his uniform.

Prosecutors said the incidents occurred at multiple sites, including a public safety building and Fire Station 2 in Pikesville. Authorities allege Carroll targeted shared items and personal property belonging to coworkers and others.

Prosecutors Detail Alleged Conduct

Court documents state that some of the locations allegedly contaminated included his supervisor’s keyboard, a refrigerated communal coffee creamer at a public safety building, and a large ice maker at Fire Station 2.

Prosecutors added that he “urinated into the ice, wiped on a scoop and used the scoop to mix the urine throughout the ice in the icemaker before making a thumbs up gesture to the camera.”

Another video allegedly showed Carroll contaminating additional items, including a carton of orange juice, hand soap, an individual’s ChapStick, a can of vegetables, an air conditioning vent in the firehouse, and a can of scented room spray in his doctor’s office waiting room.

Authorities allege that Carroll recorded the videos and uploaded them online to generate income through subscription-based websites.

Legal Status and Defense

Carroll does not have a prior criminal record, according to his defense. Reports indicate that he turned himself in following the allegations.

I don’t want to emotionally invest before there’s proof of chemistry in person, and that intangible connection can’t be felt through just messaging.

My name's Courtney. And I started my Substack in the middle of last December. I didn't and still don't have any friends or family to share it with. I didn't import a massive follower base from another platform, so I'm not one of those 'I went from 0 to 2,000 subs in a week' people. I'm currently at 94 subscribers.

Is that a lot? To some people, it may not be. It may amount to nothing for some people. It's not 940. It isn't 9,400 subscribers. But for someone that doesn't have a huge follower base anywhere else, for someone that can't just funnel a ton of family members or friends into her Substack, 94 subscribers means a lot to me. It's a lot to me, and I'm super proud of it.

I can't wait to reach 100 subs, so I can give Mom something to be happy about it, but I digress.

I don't have a picturesque life. I can't go outside and take pretty shots of coffee shops, concerts and cute bookstores. I can't take cute pictures of my pet because I don't have one. I tend to restack a lot of photos other people take. But I open up to my tiny community. I share things that would normally be trapped inside. I share my writing, my thoughts on books, and thoughts on life. I share who I am, what I am and why I am. 

I don't live in a cozy home. I don't even live in an apartment. And there's nothing but cement and buildings outside of my window. But still, I share. I create. I post on Substack.

So if you're wondering: is it worth it? Especially if you have very little friends/family, or no one at all to help you build it?

I say it is. One comment, or even just a simple restack, will remind you that it's worth it. And one day you'll find yourself feeling like it's a tiny digital home.

If you're someone that just has to hit 1,000 subs in a week, whether you have a ton of friends you can get to sub to you or not, maybe it's not worth it. If you're someone that would post two Substack notes, and would want to immediately give up if they don't become viral, maybe it's not the platform for you. The Substack experience can be seen like growing a tree.

But maybe I can help convince that maybe it is worth it. Maybe it is worth trying.

Please have a nice day.

1r24dfm,https://i.redd.it/v1f395z3mwig1.jpeg,From Stacking to Spending: Why I’m focusing on GoMining Card and MNPL!,"When I started my GoMining journey, I viewed it mostly as a ""digital wallet""—a place to accumulate Bitcoin for the long term. However, as the platform evolved, I’ve shifted my strategy.

Instead of focusing on simply stacking satoshis, I’ve started utilizing the financial features that bridge the gap between mining and real-world spending.

Here is a breakdown of the two features I’m using to manage my Bitcoin cash flow:

***1. The ""Mine Now, Pay Later"" (MNPL) Strategy***

One of the hardest parts of mining is the upfront capital requirement. GoMining solved this with the MNPL program: it allows you to activate a miner by paying an upfront sum (a 25%) and the rest in installements.

• **The Benefit**: Your hashrate starts working on the blockchain immediately after the 25% payment.

• **The Strategy**: I can decide to use my daily mining rewards to help cover the remaining installments over the 90-day period.

***2. The GoMining Payment Card***

For a long time, the biggest ""pain point"" in crypto was moving your Bitcoin to a place where you could actually buy a coffee or pay a bill.

• **Real-World Utility**: The virtual card allows me to spend my rewards directly.

• **The Incentives**: Depending on your tier, the card offers up to 5% cashback. It turns my daily mining rewards into a spendable ""stream of income."" Plus, the onboarding process includes a small hashrate free miner (1 TH/s) just for activating the card.

***Final Thoughts***

I’m moving away from being a simple ""stacker"" to becoming a real ""User."" By utilizing MNPL and the GoMining Card, I’m making Bitcoin a functional part of my daily life.

**TL;DR**: I’m focusing on the financial utility of GoMining. The MNPL program lets me scale hashrate with a 25% upfront payment, and the GoMining Card lets me spend rewards with up to 5% cashback. It’s the most practical way to use the platform in 2026!",6,1770832472.0,gomining,7,0.88,False

1r246th,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r246th/aitah_for_getting_my_driveway_plowed/,AITAH for getting my driveway plowed?,"I (38F) live in a small home that I’ve owned for a year now, by myself. one stall garage, and 100ft long driveway that empties out onto a busy road. We are supposed to keep our sidewalks plowed but it’s impossible due to the street plow trucks pushing up snow into my yard. I’ve kept up on shoveling half of my driveway so I can pull in and pull out every day, but there seems to be these ever growing ice walls on either side of my driveway where it meets the road. Not only is my entrance width narrowing as the plow trucks keep adding on, but my driveway is already uneven dirt and gravel, and the snow and ice have been constructing different pockets and shapes on the surface.

One morning I was leaving for work. Well, I was stuck digging out my tires for a half hour because of all of the ice and slush. I finally got it out, and made it to work. One of my friends told me that our boss’s longtime boyfriend (65M) of 10-15 years was there that day, and that I should ask him to plow my driveway. I always thought I was fine shoveling, because I usually am. This is, however, my first winter in this home (midwest winter with lots of heavy lake effect snow), and I am someone with a lot of anxiety and a few other diagnoses, suffering more than I should be, and my driveway was definitely giving me grief. So I asked my boss’s boyfriend, we’ll call him Freddy, if he could plow my driveway.

A little backstory:

I’ve worked at this job for 4 years. Freddy shows up a few times a week to have breakfast (we work at a restaurant). Our staff is mainly women and over the years Freddy has established himself and a corny joker, a bit generationally biased, and sometimes blesses us with a mildly inappropriate innuendo (barf) though not too often, and actually at this time it’s been a couple years and I think he’s recognizing that we don’t care for his inappropriateness. About 3 years ago he made some joke that I don’t remember in its entirety, but had been something about “b\*nging his c\*ck” which was supposed to be a funny reference to maybe butterflying and pounding out a chicken breast or something. Well I didn’t like it, and didn’t really respond to it, even though my natural instinct would be to confront someone if they are engaging in any sort of unwanted harassment style speak. My boss is nearer to his age than mine, so she’s the type to laugh at that stuff. I can’t deny that I also laugh at many different kinds of jokes, as long as they don’t cross a line, and our staff is comprised of many near-professional-level comedians, as is standard in this industry. My coworkers and I all feel similarly about Freddy. He’s a little creepy but harmless (I think and hope). I sometimes have short conversations with him while he’s at my job, and we talk about politics (we have opposing views), mental health, or worldly happenings. Sometimes he’s on a subject I have an opinion about, so I’ll respond. I’m always busy doing my actual job so all talking is in passing, between other duties, and most times include others.

My boyfriend of 4.5 years, Carl (35M), is aware of Freddy’s antics because I told him 3 years ago when he said the “Bangkok” thing. Well Carl didn’t like that. I really don’t talk about Freddy so I had no reason to think that Carl still harbored such feelings about Freddy, but this is the way things played out:

Last night Carl stayed the night at my house. He doesn’t usually do this, because he doesn’t get good sleep in my bed (even though we both slept in it for 2-3 years when living together. We live separately now). He also would always rather stay at his apartment for personal comfort reasons which I totally understand. On the way to my house, I told him I got my driveway plowed (exciting news!) and that Freddy did it, and I paid him $20. Once we entered my house I noticed a shift in Carls mood, so I asked him if he was okay. He said he was fine, but he has a knack for lying when he’s upset because he’s always terrified that bringing up his feelings will turn into an argument (he was never allowed or able to express emotion growing up an I have always advocated for him to do so, though sometimes I can exacerbate his insecurity by not receiving his emotions well when they immediately turn mean and accusatory).

I asked him again about his mood change. I was open to receive any bad feelings he had about me, but he still wouldn’t budge. He’s always been this way. I got kinda quiet and felt pretty sad and on edge, but I can’t fix or support when he doesn’t tell me the issue and leaves me guessing. I thought maybe he was upset because he was anxious about sleeping at my house, but in general he often gets upset with me for reasons I really am unaware of, and then eventually talks down to me for not being aware of it. I ended up telling him that I had 2 separate sets of feelings about what was going on in that moment: 1) That I understood he is upset and he needs space and I want to give that to him so he can process his feelings. 2) That I also feel that deliberately keeping me out of the loop is unfair. I went to bed and he came in shortly after. We watched videos and ate cheetos and eventually went to sleep. Things often get swept under the rug.

This morning, he woke up to his alarm at 8am, had to be at work by 9am. He was immediately in a bad mood. I went into support mode. Made him coffee, listened to problems, tried not to give solutions, as is my instinct. He was upset about his hours at work, and about how his boss wasn’t aware of some problems he is having. He was upset about not having a car and needing one. So I give him rides to work. He usually walks 10 blocks or so, but it’s winter and I’m sympathetic to many of his needs. While on the way to his work I say things like “I know you’re feeling defeated right now. Do you think you’re going to be okay?” and he says things like “I have to be”. I usually ask him other things like “what can I do for you?” as well, but I didn’t this time, I think because I didn’t want to overload him with questions because he doesn’t like that. He then started saying something like “I gotta figure out how to tell my bosses \[what he needs to tell them\]” and then we had a few minutes of pause as we pulled into his work parking lot.

This is when he started to tell me the reason he was upset last night. He expressed his disgust about the fact that I so leisurely told him that I allowed Freddy to plow my driveway, on top of the fact that I made the decision to allow Freddy to plow my driveway. So let’s get this straight: he was mad that I dare mention Freddy, was mad that I also didn’t think twice before I told him so casually without realizing what I was saying, and was mad at the fact that Freddy plowed it, all because of the Bangkok situation. The way he tells me these things is through his lens of disgust, and it’s painful for me to receive. There’s no soft place to land when Carl tells me what I’m doing wrong in his eyes. I immediately got on the defense, which I tried to correct by telling him his feelings are valid and that I want to hear him out, but that I was also pretty upset by how he was treating me already after I was just being so supportive. And I did mention how it felt like he is now taking out all of his work/car frustrations on me in this moment, especially when he started the conversation when we had 5 minutes before he had to clock in, adding the stress of time. What exactly can we get done in 5 minutes?

I told him if he were concerned about me hearing him, he’d have started this whole thing off with “can I tell you about how this hurt my feelings” instead of just yelling at me about how stupid I am that I didn’t NOTICE that the decision I made to ease a super huge problem of mine, shouldn’t have been made at all, because it would hurt Carl’s feelings. That I should have had somebody else plow my driveway. To be clear, he never called me the actual word “stupid”, he just talks down to me and acts disgusted with me and my actions instead of coming to me from a place of love, concern, and clarity. I have never cheated on Carl, nothing even close. Our problems revolve around miscommunication between the both of us, being heard and understood, and his constant jealousy and issues with my past, things I told him I did before I met him. I am noticeably neurodivergent, he has ADHD but doesn’t really exhibit other neurodivergent behaviors or communication styles.

ANYWAY

I told him he needs to realize that this isn’t his terf or decision to make. He can tell me how he was surprised that I made that decision, and that he didn’t like it, but that I will not accept him telling me how stupid he thinks I am for making a decision that I supposedly should’ve known better than to make, while Carl feels betrayed by an NPC that I see every couple days who means very little to me. I told him Freddy offered to plow my driveway for free if it was as easy job (he didn’t know bc he’d never been to my house before) but that I insisted on paying anyway. I told him that I understood why the Bangkok situation is still vivid for him - because of his limited experiences with Freddy. Though I’m still not partial to Freddy (can’t say it enough apparently) I see and interact with him enough for it to dull my disdain for him. I’m fine with him now. I guess. And he plowed everyone else’s driveway at work, and the opportunity absolutely fell in my lap, and I took it bc it was convenient, cheap, and it would be done before I was home from work that day, so I wasn’t there when he did it, and it really helped alleviate some anxiety for me, and I’m grateful.

Carl was still mad at me, and unwilling to see how this decision made sense for me. I told him it really didn’t make sense for him to be acting this way, but he disagreed. But since he had to go, he exited my car in the middle of us arguing still. He is still texting me telling me how I didn’t listen to him, and that he wasn’t treating me poorly.

*The night was a soft, contained atmosphere. The wind was but a gentle breeze. Darkness crept while others were at ease. But for one lone soul, it was a time of pondering, questioning what they stood for. Satono Diamond, her hair flowed gently alongside the wind's breath. Nights like this felt ever colder without her trainer, you. By her side. But that wasn't what she was searching for... She was searching for the meaning of racing.*

*Duramente's fire ceased to flare; a dim candle was all that remained of her glory, quickly extinguished by the tickling clock of time. Sounds of Earth had her reign cut short, leaving no hooves pounding on the ground. Cheval Grand long retired, only the breeze sings her name... And Kitasan Black, her best friend and her only rival, fell ill long ago. Despite your best efforts to convince her that Kitasan Black didn't take her losses seriously, Dia couldn't help but wonder who she was to fight, to race, to hear the thumping of her heart when all was left was her*

""What is a race if there is no one left to challenge?"" *Dia said solemnly. The cold breeze reflecting her pain. The deep, aching loneliness, wishing to run like she used to... footsteps echoed against the laid brick floor. Dia turns her head to the side, her eyes widening as she sees you, her trainer approaching with a cup of coffee.*

""Ah, I expected you to be here."" *You said. Almost like you knew she'd be here. A soft smile is plastered on your face as you sit down beside her with a soft thump. A sigh escapes your lips.*

""T-Torenah-San?"" *Dia's was clearly confused, not expecting any visitors out at this hour.* ""What are you doing here?"" *Before she could respond, you placed your index finger over her lips, silencing her. A soft blush follows. Her eyes dart to the side, trying to avoid your gentle gaze.*

""I've noticed you've been hurting. I know why, you don't have to lie to me, Dia-san. I prioritise my trainee's well-being above all. You know that.""

""Don't you?"" *You smile wider, your eyes catching her gaze for a fraction of a second, leading her to blush deeply.* ""Tell me. What has been bothering you all this time?"" *You question again, cocking your head to the side.....*

Dia's face grows solemn, looking down, her eyes losing their earlier shine. You notice, setting down your coffee to the side, cupping her face with your two hands. Causing her to get flustered. Despite her wish to restate her personal space, she doesn't stop you. Only letting out a soft sigh as she meets your gaze

""Torenah-San..."" *She whispers softly.* ""You really know me well, don't you?..."" *She whispers again; only then does she lift her eyes to meet yours.* ""You see... I've been wondering what my purpose of racing is anymore... Kita fell ill, Dura lost her fire... Earth lost their noise... Cheval... isn't as grand anymore... what am I supposed to do when there is no one to challenge me anymore?"" *Dia admits what has been hurting her. Her voice cracks as she starts sniffling.*

*You notice the shift; reaching forward, you plant a kiss on her forehead.* ""Dia... Even without anyone to challenge, even without anyone to race against, you still have yourself. Am I right?"" *Your voice is comforting amidst darkness that threatens to surround Dia. In this moment, she looks not like the bubbly, kind, and demanding girl you trained, but like something softer, searching for what remains to cling onto.*

""I know it hurts. Trust me. You dedicated your whole life to being the strongest. You broke the jinx, the curse. You broke the track, the dirt. Shattered records, shattered doubts. And still, you look for the things you already won... Dia. Listen to me. You are worth more than this. You may have started as a racer, but it doesn't mean that's all you have."" *Your words cut her heart deeply. Not wounding, not hurting, but healing. She stares in awe at you the only thing that breaks the silence is the sound of her crying....*

*You hold her close, whispering soft, sweet words. Comforting the diamond that lost its shine.* ""It's okay, Dia... I'm here, now and forever."" *You say, looking towards the sky as you wait for her to calm down....*

*A minute passes, and another. And another... time flashes; the moon is now illuminating from above. Dia calms down, her tears staining her gown, and she smiles for the first time in forever. Her face, finally reflecting the Dia you knew.* ""T-Thank you, Torenah-San..."" *Her voice sings gratitude, buning softly like a fire from a calm urn.*

""It's okay, Dia. I was worried about you"" *Your words get cut off, Dia leaning forward to kiss you. A deep, red blush paints your face as you lose track of what is happening. Her lips feel soft against yours, leaving you helpless as you kiss back with the same fervour. When Dia breaks off the kiss, you stare at her in surprise; both of you are left breathless.*

""D-Dia"" *Your voice was a mix of surprise and fluster, but once again, it was cut off by Dia's next words...*

""I love you, Torenah-San."" *She smiles, genuinely. Not a hint of mockery, not a hint of deception. Could it be...? No, your brain tries to shake off that thought... but it feels so true...* ""W-What?"" *You try to create a coherent response, leaving Dia pouting at the lack of acknowledgement...*

""Come on... Torenah-san"" *Dia stands up. her hand extends outward, beckoning you to hold it. You reach out, taking the invitation. Dia yanks you close as you try to reach for your coffee.* ""Come on, dear... Your breath hitches. ""Dear?"" Did she just call you dear? ""I'm sure we will taste better things on our journey..."" *The night grows warm as Dia drags you along. What is left is what will be written in the future....*

1r244p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1r244p4/my_whole_house_humidifier_hates_cappuccinos/,My Whole House Humidifier Hates Cappuccinos,"I’m looking for some help with a mystery involving a super-automatic espresso machine and a whole house humidifier.  Whenever I make a cappuccino with the machine, the humidifier in the basement starts ""clicking"" about twice per second. I don’t think it’s the solenoid; it feels like the whole unit (fan and all) is rapidly cutting out and restarting.  I can also hear a “thump” elsewhere in the house but I haven’t traced that noise just yet.

We have twinned furnaces on the same phase (leg A), both 15A circuits. The 24v line for the first floor humidifier is fed by the furnace itself, while the 24v line for the second floor humidifier is fed by this subreddit’s mascot (powered by the same leg A).  It’s the second floor humidifier on this separate 24V transformer that is clicking or turning off/off rapidly.

The espresso machine is normally plugged into a 20A kitchen outlet (also leg A).  If I move the espresso machine to the other side of the kitchen (leg B), the issue disappears completely.

The espresso machine isn't plumbed (uses a reservoir), so it’s not a water pressure issue.

I don’t get this issue with espresso or coffee, just cappuccinos.  I’m assuming something about the milk foam process and the electrical requirements for this step are driving this issue.

I checked the voltage at the humidifier with a multimeter; it shows about 26V-29V, but the digits bounce around while the espresso machine is steaming, as low as 18V but it’s possible the multimeter isn’t capturing the voltage fast enough.

Any ideas on what may be causing this?  Bad neutral/ground connections in panel? Bad or inadequate transformer for the second floor humidifier?",1,1770831955.0,AskElectricians,2,1.0,False

You know, the “trio in a duo,” the one no one remembers to put in the GC or invite to events. The rebound friend. But when I got into the later years of high school, I found a really great group of friends — a bunch of girls I trust and care for deeply. They're like my sisters, my best friends. There was never any petty drama or tense moments; we always talked everything out and had the most amazing times.

Recently, my best friend started a relationship. Let me be clear: I am very happy for her. I’m not jealous, and I honestly want it to work out. When talking to my friends about their relationships, they always say, “Your partner (and eventually your spouse) has to be like your best friend.” And I fully agree — if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone, you need to enjoy being around them, talking to them, and hanging out.

But I’m honestly confused. I guess I don’t get the hype or something. Because recently, my best friend — who I’ve known for seven years, who I’ve experienced the highs and lows of growing up with, who I stood beside during the most difficult points of her life — now tells me that her boyfriend is her best friend. How does that even happen? How does this guy you’ve known for like two months suddenly become your best friend?

It hurts that I’ve been replaced that easily.

She shares everything with him. Maybe it’s kind of shallow, but I feel like I’ve been demoted or something. Our special hole-in-the-wall café that she swore she would never bring any guys to — she sends him there regularly for coffee. That party he wasn’t invited to (when they broke up for a period of time — I wouldn’t not invite him if they were actually together), she brought him to. Our secrets, she tells him. I don’t feel like I can trust her with them anymore.

I haven’t talked to her about it because I don’t want it to come across as jealousy or being whiny or anything. I also know it wouldn’t change anything in the end.

Is this just life? Am I doomed to lose my best friend to some guy? Do I just start distancing myself before she can drop me or decide I’m obsolete like those friends before?

My mom stopped really talking to her best friend when she got married. It makes me so depressed just thinking about it. I would rather spare myself the heartache and start moving on.",2,1770831950.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1r2417u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1r2417u/how_to_tell_if_a_shy_guy_likes_you_16/,How to Tell if a Shy Guy Likes You: 16 Science-Backed Signs You're Probably Missing,"Spent way too much time analyzing this after watching my friend fumble with a shy guy for months. She kept saying ""I can't tell if he likes me or just wants to be friends"" and honestly, I get it. Shy guys are confusing as hell.



So I went down a rabbit hole. Read research on nonverbal communication, watched hours of body language analysis, talked to actual shy dudes about how they operate. Turns out there's a whole science to this that nobody talks about.



Here's what I learned that actually matters.



\*\*1. The ""accidental"" proximity thing\*\*



Shy guys won't directly approach you, but they'll engineer situations to be near you. Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows people subconsciously reduce physical distance with those they're attracted to. He'll suddenly need coffee when you're getting coffee. He'll take the long route that ""happens"" to pass your desk. It's not coincidence, it's strategy.



\*\*2. Eye contact is weird and intense\*\*



You'll catch him staring, then he'll look away FAST. Dr. Monica Moore's studies on courtship signals found that intermittent eye contact followed by looking away is one of the most reliable indicators of romantic interest. Normal friends don't get caught looking at you 47 times during lunch.



\*\*3. He remembers random shit you said\*\*



Mentioned your favorite band three weeks ago? He knows. Said you hate cilantro? He remembers. The book ""The Psychology of Human Relationships"" by Dr. Arthur Aron explains this perfectly. When we're attracted to someone, our brain flags everything about them as important. He's not just being a good listener, his brain is literally cataloging information about you.



\*\*4. His friends act weird around you\*\*



They smirk. They nudge him. They suddenly leave when you show up. His boys know. Trust me, they know. And they're terrible at hiding it.



\*\*5. He's helpful but anxious about it\*\*



He'll offer to help with literally anything, then seem nervous while doing it. Carried your boxes? His hands were probably shaking. Dr. Helen Fisher's research on attraction shows that helping behaviors spike when someone's interested because it's a low-risk way to increase interaction time.



\*\*6. Digital courage is REAL\*\*



Texts you first. Sends memes. Responds instantly. But in person? Suddenly he's a different human. Online disinhibition effect is strong with shy guys. The screen feels safer.



\*\*7. Nervous energy you can physically feel\*\*



Fidgets when talking to you. Adjusts his shirt. Runs hands through hair. Touches his face constantly. These are called ""displacement behaviors"" and they happen when someone's experiencing anxiety mixed with attraction. His body is literally trying to burn off nervous energy.



\*\*8. He finds excuses to extend conversations\*\*



""Oh wait, one more thing"" happens a lot. He'll ask follow up questions about the most mundane topics just to keep you talking. Time with you = good, so his brain keeps manufacturing reasons to not end the interaction.



\*\*9. The laugh is different\*\*



Laughs at your jokes way harder than they deserve. Research in evolutionary psychology suggests excessive laughter around someone signals interest and attempt to bond. Your mediocre pun about coffee shouldn't get that reaction, but here we are.



\*\*10. He mirrors your energy and movements\*\*



You lean in, he leans in. You cross your arms, he does too. Mirroring is an unconscious behavior that happens when we're trying to build rapport with someone we like. Studied extensively in Olivia Fox Cabane's ""[The Charisma Myth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charisma_Myth)"" His body is literally trying to sync with yours.



\*\*11. Social media stalking is OBVIOUS\*\*



Likes old photos. Watches all your stories. Comments occasionally but carefully. He's gathering intel and staying present in your digital space without being too forward about it.



\*\*12. He gets weirdly competitive or accomplished around you\*\*



Suddenly he's really good at pool. Mentions that work achievement. Brings up his gym PR. Subtle peacocking. He's trying to demonstrate value without directly bragging.



\*\*13. His voice changes\*\*



Gets quieter or sometimes deeper when talking to you. Vocal modulation happens involuntarily around people we're attracted to. Some guys' voices go up (nervousness), others go down (attempting to sound more masculine). Either way, it's different from his normal register.



\*\*14. Questions about your relationship status\*\*



Doesn't ask directly but fishes HARD for information. ""So what did you do this weekend?"" hoping you'll mention if you were with someone. ""That's a nice gift, who got it for you?"" It's reconnaissance.



\*\*15. He's suddenly interested in your interests\*\*



You mentioned loving true crime podcasts and suddenly he's listened to three episodes of your favorite show. You're into photography and he's asking about camera recommendations. He's building common ground and showing he pays attention.



\*\*16. The vibe just feels different\*\*



This is the most important one. You can feel tension that doesn't exist with other guy friends. Conversations have weight. Silences feel loaded. Your gut is probably right about this. Dr. Brené Brown's research on intuition shows we pick up on thousands of micro-signals our conscious brain doesn't process. If something feels romantic, it probably is.



\*\*Real talk though\*\*



Understanding these signs is helpful but here's what actually matters. If you like him back, you might need to make the first move or at least make it SUPER obvious you're interested. Shy guys aren't playing hard to get, they're genuinely terrified of rejection and misreading signals.



The book ""Attached"" by Amir Levine breaks down how anxious attachment styles (common in shy people) operate in relationships. They want connection but fear vulnerability. So they send signals and hope you'll decode them rather than risking direct rejection.



Want to go deeper on relationship psychology without spending hours reading dense books? [BeFreed](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450&ved=2ahUKEwjkvZGG0NGSAxWnRmwGHXFsIcgQFnoECB4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1KtHkWuBtO3jhNTsWhztFF) is an AI-powered audio learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that turns insights from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized podcasts. You can type in something like ""understanding shy guys in dating as someone who's also introverted"" and it'll create a custom learning plan pulling from sources like ""[Attached](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.amazon.in/Attached-Identify-attachment-style-perfect-ebook/dp/B0050CJNJC&ved=2ahUKEwicm-SA0dGSAxUCe2wGHQ2yMw0QFnoECC0QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1cnKLD-lvbBdc4qShMMM5F),"" Dr. Helen Fisher's work, and other relationship science. You can choose quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with real examples, and customize the voice to whatever keeps you engaged. Makes understanding communication patterns way more digestible than trying to wade through academic papers.



Also Insight Timer has some solid meditations on relationship anxiety if you want to understand the internal experience he might be having. Helps build empathy for why he's moving slow.



The neuroscience here is actually fascinating. When shy guys interact with someone they like, their amygdala (fear center) and nucleus accumbens (reward center) are both firing. They want to get closer but their brain is literally screaming danger signals simultaneously. It's not that they don't like you, it's that their nervous system is having a full crisis every time you make eye contact.



Most people miss these signs because they're expecting confident, direct interest. But shy guys show interest through consistency, attention to detail, and creating opportunities for connection rather than bold moves. Different playbook, same game.



Watch for patterns, not single incidents. One lingering look means nothing. Fifteen means something. He helped you once? Cool. He's offered to help every single time you've mentioned needing something? Yeah, he likes you.",1,1770831754.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

For sale: 1 year subscription to [Trade.com](http://Trade.com) coffee. I bought this on black friday at their biggest discount of the year (25% off) selling for $198. The 1 year subscription includes 12 11 oz bags,  

I **am asking$170**.  This subscription includes free shipping on all of your orders.  This would put the price per 11 oz bag at about $14 each. 

  
I have been a [Trade.com](http://Trade.com) customer for about 6 months now and really enjoyed it as it let me try out a lot of different espresso. Everything I got from them was super fresh. Their customer service is also top notch. I got one bag of beans I really did not enjoy the taste of and they sent me a replacement basically no questions asked.

Very unfortunately for me last month I was diagnosed with gastritis and I am forced to give up all forms of coffee for the foreseeable future. Nobody else in my household drinks coffee so I really have no use for this at this point. 

I can provide references from my ebay account with over 1000 feedback as a seller and also from a few reddit groups which I have sold on in the past. 

I would prefer to sell this Via paypal friends and family but can accept venmo or cash for buyers local to northern Utah. I am willing to sell via paypal goods and services and venmo goods and services for a buyer that is well vetted with feedback.

1r23zji,https://i.redd.it/3bnappejjwig1.png,How a Coffee Shop Got 86% More Calls in 12 Days (Just Google Business Profile),"**How a Coffee Shop Got 86% More Calls in 12 Days (Just Google Business Profile)**



**TL;DR:**

Took a coffee shop's GBP from 82% complete to 100% and aligned it with their website. No ads, no backlinks, no new reviews. Result? Maps visibility jumped from 40% to 70%. Calls went from 14 to 26 per month. All in 12 days.



**The Setup**

Small coffee shop in Massillon, Ohio. Great local reputation. But when people searched ""coffee shop"" or ""coffee near me,"" they basically didn't exist on Google Maps.

**Starting Point (Before):**

* • GBP completeness: 82%
* • Maps visibility: \~40%
* • Ranking in top 3: 36% of the time
* • Average Maps position: 7.7
* • Monthly calls: 14
* • Direction requests: 180



**What Changed (GBP Work Only):**



**Completed missing GBP sections:**

* • Filled in services, attributes, Q&A, description



**Dialed in categories:**

* • Refined primary and secondary categories



**Added fresh photos:**

* • Real location shots (not stock images)



**Started posting consistently:**

* • Hours updates + seasonal content



**Aligned website signals:**

* • Made sure title tags and H1s matched GBP



**Expanded service area:**

* • Added nearby towns (naturally, no stuffing)



**What I didn't touch:** Citations, reviews, backlinks.



**Results (12 Days Later):**

* • Maps visibility: 40% → 70%
* • Top 3 rankings: 36% → 51%
* • Average position: 7.7 → 5.4
* • Monthly calls: 14 → 26
* • Direction requests: 180 → 240



**The Surprise**

Generic search terms (""coffee"", ""coffee shop"") moved way more than geo-specific ones (""coffee Massillon Ohio""). That was unexpected.



**What I Learned:**

1. That missing 18% of GBP completion mattered more than I thought

2. Matching GBP signals to website signals moved things fast

3. Generic discovery terms are more reactive than you'd think



**Question for the group:** Are you seeing similar movement from GBP completion and category work, even when reviews and citations stay the same?

The afternoon hovers just beyond the window. Mom is at the call center again, lending her voice to strangers who will never know how tired she is. I remain in our motel room, building small kingdoms out of sentences. On my screen, a magical quarterback is falling in love with a barista, and for a few bright moments the world feels arranged by destiny instead of bills.

The NFL season has ended, and the silence it leaves behind is larger than it should be. Sundays feel unclaimed. We miss the ritual of it, the way a game can make a motel room feel like a cathedral. We love the sport with a devotion that surprises even us. Now there is a hollow where the noise used to be.

Mom texted that she is tired. I am tired too. The day has barely begun and already my thoughts are sprinting ahead of me, rehearsing worries like lines in a play. Joy arrives in small, shimmering fragments. A shared laugh. A good cup of coffee. A plot twist that works. Then it dissolves, and we are still here, still surviving, still not home.

She speaks in practical timelines. Six months. Eight months. Save what we can. Move somewhere slightly better. It is a reasonable plan. It is the sort of plan the world applauds for its sensibility. But I do not feel built for reasonable mediocrity. We have already endured too much to settle for a life that only almost fits. I want more than endurance. I want arrival.

We have no friends here. No family nearby. No circle to catch us if we fall. On paper, there is no mechanism that lifts two women from survival into something luminous. There is no neat equation that solves for belonging.

And yet I believe in one.

I believe in a miracle not because the math supports it, but because my heart does. I believe the universe is not counting pennies in some distant vault. I believe we were meant to find a place that feels like recognition, like stepping into a room and knowing it has been waiting for us all along.

So here I sit. In our motel room. Waiting for a miracle to light our way home.

Not in six months. Not in another year. Not five years from now.

okay so i've been researching procrastination like crazy (books, neuroscience podcasts, research papers, all that) because i was tired of knowing exactly what i needed to do but still scrolling tiktok for 3 hours instead. turns out it's not a personality flaw or laziness. it's your dopamine system being completely hijacked by modern life.

here's the thing nobody talks about: your brain doesn't procrastinate because you're unmotivated. it procrastinates because the dopamine hit from checking your phone is instant and guaranteed, while the reward from finishing that project report is delayed and uncertain. your brain is literally doing math and choosing the safer bet every single time.

and social media companies know this. they've hired neuroscientists specifically to make their apps as addictive as possible. so yeah, you're fighting billion dollar algorithms designed to exploit your biology. no wonder you can't focus on your taxes.

but the good news? once you understand how dopamine actually works, you can game the system back.

## what's actually happening in your brain

**dopamine isn't the ""pleasure chemical"" everyone thinks it is.** it's the ""motivation and anticipation"" chemical. neuroscientist andrew huberman explains this perfectly on his podcast. your brain releases dopamine when it anticipates a reward, not when you get it. that's why scrolling instagram feels better than actually achieving something. the anticipation keeps spiking.

here's where it gets wild: when you expose yourself to constant high dopamine activities (social media, junk food, porn, whatever), you raise your baseline dopamine threshold. now normal activities like reading or working feel painfully boring in comparison. your brain literally can't get excited about them anymore.

**dr anna lembke talks about this in her book ""dopamine nation.""** she's a stanford psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist. the book is insanely good, breaks down how we're all basically addicted to overstimulation without realizing it. she explains that our brains have this self regulating mechanism where pleasure and pain exist on the same scale. when you flood your system with too much pleasure (high dopamine), your brain compensates by tipping toward pain. that's why you feel like shit after binge scrolling.

the solution? **dopamine fasting.** not the fake tiktok version, the actual neuroscience backed approach. you basically reset your dopamine baseline by avoiding high stimulation activities for a set period.

## how to actually fix your dopamine system

**start with a 24 hour reset.** pick one day where you cut out all the high dopamine stuff: no phone, no social media, no processed foods, no video games, no porn. just boring analog activities. read a physical book, go for a walk, cook something basic, sit with your thoughts.

yeah it sounds miserable. it will be miserable. dr lembke says that's literally the point. you need to let your brain recalibrate. after about 2 weeks of doing this regularly (doesn't have to be every day), normal activities start feeling rewarding again. suddenly you can actually focus on that work project without wanting to claw your eyes out.

**make hard tasks easier to start.** james clear covers this brilliantly in ""atomic habits."" he's a behavior change expert and the book has sold like 15 million copies for good reason. his whole thing is about reducing friction. if you want to work out in the morning, sleep in your gym clothes. if you need to write, open the document the night before so it's staring at you when you wake up.

the 2 minute rule is legit life changing: any task can be started in 2 minutes or less. you're not committing to finishing the entire thing, just starting. ""write the novel"" becomes ""write one sentence."" your brain can handle that. and once you start, continuing feels easier than stopping.

if you want a more structured way to tackle procrastination but don't have energy to read through dense psychology books, there's an app called BeFreed that turns research, expert insights, and books like the ones mentioned here into personalized audio learning. built by AI experts from Columbia and Google, it pulls from neuroscience research, productivity books, and behavioral psychology talks to create custom podcasts based on your specific struggle. you can literally type something like ""i'm a chronic procrastinator who can't stop doomscrolling and i want practical strategies to fix my focus"" and it'll generate a learning plan with episodes you can listen to during your commute. you control the depth too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. plus the voice options are actually good, there's this smoky one that makes learning way less boring than it sounds.

**use strategic dopamine spikes.** this is key. you're not eliminating dopamine, you're being intentional about it. reward yourself after completing hard tasks, not before. finish the work session, then check your phone. complete the workout, then have the good coffee.

cal newport talks about this in ""deep work."" he's a computer science professor at georgetown who's written extensively about focus and productivity. the book will make you question everything about how you structure your workday. his argument is that the ability to do deep focused work is becoming increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. he recommends scheduling specific times for shallow work (emails, admin stuff) and protecting long blocks for deep work where you're completely unreachable.

**create friction for distractions.** delete social media apps from your phone. sounds extreme but it works. you can still access them through a browser if you really need to, but that extra step is enough to break the automatic checking habit. use website blockers during work hours. i use freedom app, it's clean and actually blocks stuff at the router level so you can't cheat.

**embrace boredom.** this is the hardest one honestly. we've trained ourselves to fill every empty moment with stimulation. standing in line? check phone. waiting for water to boil? check phone. dr lembke says we need to get comfortable with boredom again because that's when our brains reset and creativity happens.

start small: next time you're waiting somewhere, just wait. don't pull out your phone. let your mind wander. it'll feel weird at first. do it anyway.

## the mindset shift that actually matters

here's what changed everything for me: **realizing that procrastination isn't about the task itself.** it's about avoiding negative emotions. we're not avoiding the work, we're avoiding feeling incompetent or anxious or overwhelmed.

research from dr tim pychyl (he runs the procrastination research group at carleton university and has a great podcast called ""iprocrastinate"") shows that procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem. you're basically choosing short term mood repair over long term goals.

the fix? **accept the discomfort instead of running from it.** when you feel that urge to procrastinate, pause and identify what emotion you're avoiding. boredom? anxiety? fear of failure? just naming it reduces its power.

then do the thing anyway while feeling uncomfortable. sounds brutal but it's like exposure therapy. each time you push through that discomfort, your brain learns that the anticipated pain was worse than the actual experience. over time, starting hard tasks becomes less daunting.

## putting it together

look, nobody's going to have perfect focus 100% of the time. that's not realistic or even healthy. but understanding that your procrastination isn't a moral failing, it's a hijacked dopamine system competing with modern technology, that reframing alone is powerful.

your brain isn't broken. it's actually working exactly as designed. you just need to redesign your environment and habits to work with your biology instead of against it.

start with one thing. do a 24 hour dopamine reset this weekend. or delete one social media app. or try the 2 minute rule tomorrow morning. small changes compound over time into completely different patterns.

the work doesn't get easier. but your capacity to do it absolutely can increase. and that's the whole point.

My sister is a clutter bug, and has a bunch of wine bottles that she's saved because she wants to use the labels to decorate something in the future (maybe a coffee table, maybe something else, she doesn't know yet).  I'd say it's probably taking up the space of a large rubbermaid plastic tote, maybe more.  I've read up on ways to safely remove the labels to keep them intact (like pouring boiling water from a kettle into the bottle to loosen the glue, letting it cool enough to be safe to touch and then gently peeling them off the bottles, or using a hair dryer to loosen the glue).

What I'm asking is: does anyone have ideas of how I could then safely store the labels for her so they could be used for a future project?  And does anyone have experience with storing labels like this?  I'd like to avoid any common errors/complications people have found.

The only idea I've thought of so far is putting them all individually in plastic page protectors in a binder.  I'd try to let them cool/let any remaining glue dry fully before putting them into the page protectors, but I'm not sure if they'd then just bind themselves to the page protectors over time and create a mess.

The biggest storage concern is how to prevent the labels from all sticking to each other/something else once they're off of the bottles.",1,1770831109.0,crafts,6,1.0,False

Scalper’s Ridge is the local high point that separates our forest into two. It runs like a backbone through the uniform pine and aspen. Though the top of the ridge itself is relatively flat, the path leading up to it was far from flat. The final 3 or 4 miles accounted for the majority of the elevation gain. The going was slow, but we pushed on. Reg led the way, and it was clear that his older body was being tested. His skill and experience were struggling to balance out the crippling power of age. As I followed Reg, my mind wandered far off trail. I thought of the miles of pure, untouched timber that surrounded me, of the beauty of the land, and the animals that called it home. And in a moment, I thought of Hank.

My mind had been working overtime to keep any thought of him at bay, but now the slowness of our progress and the boringness that followed served as the perfect avenue for his memory to work its way to center stage. Had he suffered? What was his dying thought? Did he know it was over? Was the accident my fault? What about his family? What would they think of me? Hank’s friend, who flees moments after his death? What was I doing? Am I really that much of a coward to run and hide, instead of being there for them in their pain? Ward was right. I couldn’t outrun this. In that moment, the wilderness lost all its beauty; it was no longer freedom, it was a cage. A cage I ran into, hoping to be free. In the quietness of the hike, Hank’s memory haunted me. Time marched on as my mind prosecuted me with evidence of my shame and guilt. The world around me was a blur, and I marched on completely unaware of my surroundings, until suddenly my daze was broken as my legs were knocked out from under me. I fell hard on my face, and the steep trail combined with gravity caused my body to roll and pick up speed as I headed down the trail, until a weathered pine broke my fall, as my pack and back slammed into it. I slowly lifted my aching and bruised body, and in response to the sharp pain in my left thigh, I looked down and saw a large shard of glass protruding from the meaty mass of my thigh. My beer bottle had smashed, and a portion of it had found a new home in my leg. I winced in pain and quickly hobbled over to the body of Reg.

“Reg!” I shouted, “Are you alright?”

Reg had slipped; the slick, muddy, and steep trail offered light grip for his 10-year-old boots, and in an instant, his body went violently horizontal and began to slide down the trail and directly into me, bowling me over and continuing for a dozen feet to his final resting place at the side of a large boulder. At my cry, he slowly shifted and pulled himself to his knees, swearing under his breath. He calmed my fears by saying,

“I’m alright, son, just some bruises, and my pride is in shambles. I’m sorry for knocking you over. This is a young man’s game, and I don’t move as I used to.” 

 he reached out his arm to me, looking for support to get to his feet, as he did he noticed the piece of glass in my leg.

 “Nate, are you ok? What happened?”

“Eh, my beer smashed in the fall, and just my luck, I got caught with the glass.”

 “Well, I guess I have better luck than you. Mine broke as well, but I didn’t catch any glass. Help me get the 1st aid kit out of my pack, and we’ll take care of that.”

 Thankfully, the glass missed everything important in my thigh, and after getting it cleaned and covered, it hardly bothered me. Other than that and a small cut on Reg’s face, we emerged fairly untouched from the fall. And we pressed on with the final stretch, and shortly after this incident, we summited the ridge. At the top, we were rewarded with perfect 360-degree views of everything. Everything in our small world, we saw the borders of our territory in every direction, and we truly felt like the kings of the kingdom. Judging by the position of the sun, and confirmed by our watches, we summited with just under three hours of daylight. Plenty of time to settle in, set up our tents, start a fire, and prepare dinner. Chef Boyardee canned spaghetti and meatballs never tasted so good.

After nightfall, the stars came out to dance. I never saw so much of the night sky. It was glorious and the full moon illuminated the surrounding woods, making flashlights unnecessary. Around the campfire with cheap noodles and fake meatballs in his stomach, Reg came alive. Clearly, he was fueled by the outdoors and adventure. He laughed deeply and freely, and he told cringy stories about his first ex-wife, all while the fire danced wildly in his eyes. As his storybook began to run dry, and he became quieter, he stared into the fire, hypnotized by its movements. After a few silent moments, he slowly, in a low voice, began to chant in a language I did not know. It was lively and melodious. It was beautiful, and though I did not understand, I found it calming.

“What was that?” I asked when he had finished.

With a smile, he replied. “The elders of my people used to sing that song during the lessons I had as a child. It speaks of the provision of the land, the food from the water and forests, the shelter from the trees, and the power from the earth. It’s a happy song, it is to remind us that nature provides all we need. So many of my people have forgotten their past, both the good and the bad. They have lost their bond with the earth because of the distractions of modern life. I sing that song from time to time to remind myself of what they have forgotten. That the earth provides for its children, and we shouldn’t scorn her gift.”

 “Thank you for sharing, it was beautiful, and I’m glad I got to hear it.”

 he shrugged and smiled, “It’s meant to be shared, and its words make me happy.”

 I nodded in agreement and reached for my water bottle. Our conversation was good; we spoke of our lives, our dreams, our fears, and our worries. Nothing was held back around the fire.

Drowsiness loomed heavy on me; I was more than ready to head to my tent and give up the fight against sleep's power. But as I opened my mouth to announce my surrender, a different noise echoed through the night. A cruel, cold, piercing howl. Not a howl like a wolf or coyote would make, more like a scream, not a scream of pain, but one of rage and malice. it froze my blood. In fear, I asked,

“What in the world was that?”

Reg sighed and added more wood to the fire. It felt like an eternity before he answered, and when he did, his voice was strong, yet low and reverent.

“Not everything that lives in the woods can be found in a guidebook. Such things are rejected by the so-called rational world. But my people speak of such things, the elders told, whispered tales of creatures in the deep woods that moved like shadows and remained just out of sight and followed travelers through dense timber, waiting for the right moment to attack those it stalked. Its real name is dangerous to say, but in English, the elders referred to them as ‘stick Indians’. Lumberjacks and those who settled here in the northwest gave it a different name, but it doesn’t matter; the name won’t give us power over it. The legends don’t tell us what they look like, for no man has seen one and lived. If the thing existed, our greatest defense is to remain on guard and be vigilant at all times.”

 My voice cracked slightly as I answered, “Do you really think that’s what made that noise?”

he shrugged, “I’m open to the idea, though I think there’s some more likely culprits, like a mountain lion.”

I frowned, “Wait a minute, if you thought it was a mountain lion, why did you tell me all that other stuff?”

A wide smile spread across his face.

“Well, I thought it would be a good laugh, I don’t get to scare the new guy very often, and the look on your face was priceless.”

He said, bursting out laughing. I blushed and said,

“I didn’t find it that funny.”

 “Oh come on, Nate, what good is a fire if we’re not telling scary stories? One day, you’ll be the old guy and get to make fun of the newbie.”

Shaking my head, I said,

 “Well, now I have to get you back.”

“Good luck, son, good luck.” He said as he stood and stretched, “I got to take a leak,”

 he said, “Don’t wait up if you don’t want to,”

And with that, he headed off into the woods to do his business. Like a child, I sat at the fire and sulked. I couldn’t believe that I had fallen for such a stupid story. Of course, it was a mountain lion, and Reg played my fear like a master. I had to get him back. So I began to think of a good comeback, and by the time that I decided that putting spaghetti and meatballs in his sleeping bag was too cruel, I realized Reg hadn’t come back yet. Standing up and looking around, I shouted,

“Oh come on, Reg, this isn’t funny, let it go.”

 I stood quietly and listened for a moment. Nothing, not a sound.

“Reg, I’m tired, come out already.”

Suddenly, a twinge of fear entered my mind. Maybe he had fallen and gotten hurt. I headed off in the direction he went. Straining my eyes to see in the low light, my foot kicked something that had been lying on the ground, and I knelt and saw it was Reg’s water bottle. Panic filled my mind, Reg could be hurt, I thought,

“Reg! Are you ok?”

 I started back toward the fire to grab my headlamp. I searched the area for what felt like hours. I screamed his name, calling for him to return. When all of a sudden, there was a noise, a noise that sent shivers up my spine, and muted my calls to Reg. I went silent as an ungodly combination of two disgusting sounds: heavy gruff breathing and wet smacking filled my ears. Almost instinctively, I turned off my headlamp and quietly snuck my way toward the sound; whatever was making it was not something I wanted to run up on. And so I walked further from the fire and closer to the sound, which grew in volume and intensity. About a quarter mile out from our camp, the sound was deafening. As though its source was now within my own mind. All other sounds vanished, and the night air was consumed with heavy breathing and smacking. Turning a corner, I saw the source of both the sound and my constant nightmares.

 Before me was a massive ancient tree sitting alone amid a clearing, and hanging up against the side of the tree was Reg, or at least pieces of Reg. Seven feet off the ground, his head was pinned to the tree by a large branch that had been shoved under the back of his skull, and out of his mouth. His eyes had been ripped out, leaving behind two craters of bloody flesh. Attached to his head, like a string attached to a balloon, was his wet, shiny spine. And like a jacket hung in the closet, torn long flaps of loose skin cloaked the spine like a cape hanging off what little remained of Reg’s shoulders. And there, at the base of the tree with its back to me, squatted a beast too awful to be real. Even while crouching, the creature was taller than any man, though it was far thinner than humanly possible; every bone in its evil body was visible as its pale, grey, hairless, moist skin stretched tight over every joint. Its limbs were far too long, nothing more than skin-covered bone that yielded to awful, needle-like claws on its long, twig-like fingers. Its head was unlike a man's; it looked like the skin of a human head, yet stretched over the skull of a bear, leaving the skin too tight to be distinguished from bone. The creature sat and devoured the inner flesh of Reg. Its heavy breathing was only interrupted by the wet smacking of human flesh being consumed. I gasped and felt the sudden need to vomit. Slowly, I reached up to turn on my headlamp to confirm what the moonlight was showing me. As the light reached the colorless skin of the things back, it froze. I held my breath as the creature's head slowly turned over its shoulder and its eyes rested upon me.

Those large, perfectly round eyes were pitch black and lifeless, like the eyes of a great white shark, only with more malice. That eye contact, though it was probably only seconds, felt like days. But suddenly, with a movement like lightning, the thing was on its feet and facing my direction. Its jaw opened far too wide, revealing rows and rows of long, needle-like teeth, and with a scream of pure rage, it lurched towards me. I cried in fear, surely I couldn’t outrun this monster, and though I wanted to, my body wouldn’t allow it. Instead, I turned around, not wanting to see its teeth meet my flesh, and fell into the fetal position, waiting for my death to come. Only it didn’t, I waited, squinting my eyes shut, and shielding my head with my hands. But nothing happened. I slowly opened my eyes, but I dared not turn around. It was still there, it was right behind me, I could feel its warm breath on my neck, it couldn’t have been more than 2 inches from me. Its labored breathing echoed in my ears. What do I do? I thought the only response from my brain was Don’t turn around. I slowly crawled on my stomach, yet it followed, right behind me. If I raised my head slightly, I was sure I would touch its mouth that loomed over me. It hadn’t killed me yet, so I crawled. With each movement, I got a little bolder and faster. Before long, I worked up the courage to get to my knees and crawl. It still followed. Soon, I slowly, at a snail's pace, inched my way up into a standing position; I dared not turn around. Its breath was hot on my neck. There we stood, the creature, like my shadow, stood right behind me, and then it spoke. Its voice was loud and broken; it lacked any cadence. Like a dog that has been taught a handful of words, it sounded wrong, like something that shouldn’t speak was speaking. It was deep and guttural. In broken English, it said,

“LOOK. AT. ME.”

The words nearly killed me. And its profane voice said,

“LOOK. AT. ME.”

I was petrified. Behind me stood a living nightmare that had just murdered my friend, and before me was the black emptiness of the wilderness. I could try to run, but this creature could, in an instant, reach out and slash my throat in one motion. Why hadn’t it? Its claws were inches away. Was it playing with me? Did it find my terror amusing? And if I ran, would it end its game in the same way it had ended Reg? I had to do something; I had to move. So I slowly lifted my right foot and took one step. Nothing happened. Was this a trap? Was it simply waiting for me to get comfortable and let my guard down? I took another step. Again nothing. I began to shuffle my way forward and sensed that I had formed some distance between me and the monster; it made no sound, yet I no longer felt its breath on my neck. I froze. Was the thing still there? What if it had quietly left and was waiting ahead of me to attack? What if it was back at camp or in my tent? The thoughts consumed me. I dared not look back. What if it was still there? It wanted me to look at it. What would happen if I did? Certainly, it would be death. I needed to get away. I closed my eyes and walked five steps forward. There was a small noise behind me and to the left. A twig snapping. Was it there? Was it following me? I didn’t wait around to find out. Every five steps, I would open my eyes to see what the next group of steps held. First it was five, then seven, and finally ten. It was slow going; the 30 minutes it took to get to Reg’s tree took twice as long going at this pace. And all the while, little noises echoed no more than 30 feet behind me. They were normal forest sounds, the breaking of a twig, the crisp rustling of dirt and fallen pine needles, the scraping of branches against trees.

 Under any other circumstance, these sounds would have gone unnoticed and drifted away into the symphony of the woods at night. But I knew better; I knew everything I heard had a single source. It was following me. Before long, I saw the fire's light; it glowed low in the distance and warmly illuminated my yellow and gray tent. This camp was not my goal; there was no salvation in that tent. It only showed me the location of the main trail out of here. I stood by the fire, taking a moment to warm my shaking hands. Somehow, I knew that fire would not ward off the creature that stalked me. I felt its presence in the bushes behind me, the fire warmed me, and the bushes rustled behind me. This was going to be a long night.

I had to run. It was the only way. I doubt the cabin would provide much protection, but it was better than a tent. I had to make it; I didn’t care about my pack or my tent; they would just slow me down. I wasn’t much of a runner; there was no way I could run all of the 15 miles that lay before me, and I doubt I could do even 5, but maybe I could widen the gap between me and that thing. My back stiffened as I worked up the courage to put my plan into action. Even on this cold night, I was sweating. With as much energy as I could muster sprinted from the warmth of the fire, down the way Reg had led me just a few hours earlier. Adrenaline was my fuel, and I stumbled and fell more than once, but it didn’t matter; scraped knees and bruised hips weren’t going to stop me. I had to keep going. One mile passed, and then two. Even though I was aided by going downhill, I was exhausted. My pace slowed from a sprint to a jog. And at my slowed pace, the sound of movement behind me reached my ears. Heavy footsteps and clear rustling in the brush. It had followed. It was hunting me; that realization was all I needed to keep going.

According to my watch, I reached mile 12 just after 1 AM. In a former life, I would have just finished a shift at a boring yet safe job. I’d be cracking jokes with my friend, but instead, I was here, stumbling around the woods as an unknown creature stalked me. Every fiber of my being wanted to stop, but fear carried me on, though it was barely faster than a walk. The footsteps were fast and irregular, unlike an animal, and unlike a man, but each step was intelligent and purposeful. It kept its distance, not too close, not too far, fifty feet or so, certainly not out of striking distance for a being like this. I pressed on, the wound in my thigh burned, and my feet longed for a break, but I knew no rest would come until I was inside the cabin, for in the cabin was the radio, and with the radio would come help. Soon, I saw the cabin, which looked so peaceful and picturesque as if all was right in the world. less than a mile now, but my shadow was closing in. It had split the gap between us, as if it knew I was nearing my refuge. As my pace slowed, its pace quickened slightly. My eyes were locked on the cabin door, only 300 feet now, I thought.

“LOOK,” boomed the voice behind me.

 I froze my blood. How easily I could have convinced myself that the voice I heard last night was all in my head, I could have convinced myself that Reg was attacked by a mountain lion, which chased me back to the cabin. But that voice dragged me back to reality. It spoke again, “LOOK. AT. ME.” I stopped, only 100 feet between me and the door. I would have to move fast. I sprinted, and it followed right behind. My body slammed into the wooden door, and it opened. I was in, quickly I turned, and closed the door, throwing the dead bolt. And not a moment too soon, as a heavy force shook the door, the hinges groaned, and the wood vibrated. I backed up from the door, praying it would hold. It did. Whatever was on the other side of the door pounded it with an unearthly viciousness. Blow after blow rocked the old door, yet it held.  The creature screamed with rage,

“LOOK. AT. ME! LOOK. AT. ME! LOOK. AT. ME!”

It went on and on, screaming and banging, it did not weary or relent. On and on it went. I couldn’t stand it; I gripped my ears, hoping to dull the noise, but it did no good. Ward wouldn’t be at headquarters till 6 AM, meaning there was no one to hear my pleas for help over the radio, yet plead I did, the only response I received was static. It was now 3 AM, and I pulled the blinds on every window in the place, creating a calming, yet false sense of security. Soon, the awful sounds at the door quieted, and relief flooded my mind; drowsiness came next, the kind that can’t be beat, and sleep overwhelmed me. The couch caught my fall.

A metallic clicking jolted me awake two hours later; it was 5 AM. My heart stopped as I realized that the clicking was the sound of an unknown force outside testing the door handle. I shot up from the couch; eyes fixed upon the jiggling door handle. The deadbolt boldly held the line; the little metal bolt was my only defense against the dark forest outside. I held my breath as the handle continued to dance. A quivering voice broke the silence,

“Reg? Are you in there? Please let me in.”

It was a woman’s voice; it was Sarah’s voice. I took a step towards the door.

“Sarah? It’s Nate, are you ok? Reg is gone.”

 She whimpered and began to sob. Through tears, she squeaked out her plea,

 “Nate, please let me in. There’s something out here.”

 I dashed to the door, but as my hand hovered above the deadlock, the words of Ward echoed in my mind Never open the door after dark. I gently placed my ear against the door, and I heard a poor, sniffling woman, but beyond that, something else was there, another sound, a deep, heavy breathing. Turning to the door, I asked quietly,

 “Sarah, are you ok?”

 The sobbing stopped, and it was quiet for a moment.

“Please, just open the door.”

 I inched my way over to the window and peeked out through the blinds. I gasped at what I saw. There at the door stood a battered and bruised Sarah; there she stood, forehead resting against the door, long black blade-like fingers wrapped around her head, as though it were a basketball. The fingers led to the bony arm attached to the hulking, emaciated figure that stood in the shadows. As I slept, it must have gone back to Sarah’s camp and dragged her back to my door, hoping I would open it to her. I pulled back from the window.

“Please, Nate,” she pleaded.

“I’m sorry, Sarah, I can’t.”

 The silence that followed was potent, but then Sarah screamed. A high bloodcurdling scream, and as the screaming started, so did the pounding. The creature pounded her head against the door, like it was a hammer pounding a nail. She screamed the whole time. First, it was a loud pain pain-filled scream, but as the pounding continued, the scream became gurgled as blood filled her nose and mouth, and then the screaming stopped, and all that remained was the sound of a flattened head hitting solid wood. The creature was enraged; it screamed and shouted and rocked the door with its fists, but still the door held.

 At 5:50 AM, the creature began to circle the cabin, occasionally stopping at the door to pound on it. At 6:01 AM, I grabbed the radio receiver, still a minute late, I hope Ward won’t mind.

“Hello, is anyone there? This is Nate Diaz, and I need help!”

 I frantically yelled into the handheld receiver. Seconds of static passed, no response, and I repeated my plea,

 “Anyone please, this is Nate Diaz, I need help!”

“Diaz!” yelled the radio. “This had better be good, my coffee hasn’t finished brewing, and already the rookie is screaming on the radio, what’s this all about?” said the grumpy voice of Tim Ward.

“Ward, I need help, something's after me, it's here at the cabin, it followed me back.”

A now serious Ward responded, “Where is Reg?”

 “Reg is dead,” I yelled, “and so is Sarah.”

 Ward pounded his desk with his fist and swore loudly, before redirecting his attention again towards me and blankly saying in a gruff voice,

 “Did you see it?”

“What?”

 “The creature, did you see it?”

 I fell silent. I didn’t know what to say.

“Damnit, Diaz, did you look at it?” Ward screamed.

 “Yeah, I saw it.”

The radio went silent before he quietly asked,

“Did you see its eyes?”

 I’ll never forget those eyes,

“Yeah, yeah, I did.”

He gasped before muttering,

“Dear God, help us.”

 “What is this, Ward? What is this thing?”

With a sigh, he answered,

“A HideBehind.”

 “A what?” I said,

 “A HideBehind, that’s what they call it, I don’t know what it is, maybe it’s an animal, maybe it’s a native spirit, or maybe something in between. It’s a stealth hunter that preys on lone people in the wilderness; it always remains behind you or right at the corner of your vision, as it waits for the perfect time to strike, or at least that’s its normal behavior. What you did broke it.”

I swallowed and asked, “What do you mean?”

 “You’ve seen it,” he said, “even more, you’ve looked it in the eye, no one who has ever seen its eyes has lived, but it isn’t going to just kill you, no, it’s a hunter, the game it plays has changed, instead of hiding from you, it now tries to catch you looking, it will follow you, no matter where you go, and it will hound you till at last you break and look at its eyes again, and then it will kill you. You’re its only target now, it must keep its perfect record.”

He paused, and I didn’t know what to say. After a while, he continued,

“How did this happen, Diaz? Why didn’t you and Reg pack beer?”

 “We did, sir, but our bottles smashed in a fall we took on the trail. What good is beer?”

“Well, it’s the only thing we have found that will keep it at bay. The smell of fermentation seems to upset it. But that won’t help you now; it didn’t help the last guy, it won’t help you. The rage it has for you is greater than its dislike of the smell.”

“The last guy?” I asked, “This has happened before?”

“Yes, a few times,” he said blankly, “in the back of the drawer by the stove, there’s a letter from one of the other victims, there are some helpful survival tips in it, I’m going to take the ATV up to you, read it while you wait for me. Don’t worry, when I get there, it will hide. It has too for everyone who hasn’t seen its eyes, be ready to go when I get there.”

“How many have survived?” I asked

“None. I’ll be there soon, over and out.”

The radio went silent, and I suddenly realized I had been holding my breath. My hands were shaking, and my mouth was dry. I no longer had any love for the wilderness; I see now it never loved me. I was nothing more than a fly in the web, a sheep led to slaughter. I was no conqueror, no explorer; great adventurers would have laughed at the sad, scared child I had become. I had given my heart to a cruel mistress, and now I was to pay the price. I went to the stove, opened the drawer to its right, and in the back, under a collection of oven mitts, was a crinkled letter. I took a deep breath and began to read. It said the following:

“To the poor soul who has seen the HideBehind:

What hunts you is an unnatural force, a creature with no mercy or compassion. It enjoys its hunt, and you messed it up, so you must pay. I have no solutions for you; humanity hasn’t found a way to kill this thing, and it will not rest until it ties up any loose ends, mainly you. I can only offer you some advice; hopefully, it will help:

·       You need to stay around lots of people; the HideBehind is no longer hiding from you, but it still must hide from others, so your best hope is to remain around crowds.

·       We have found only two defenses against the HideBehind: alcohol and locked doors. Alcohol won’t help you anymore; it only helps if it's stalking, it's not stalking you anymore. But locked doors still work; always lock your doors, it's your only defense now.

·       Kill yourself, save yourself from the pain that’s coming.

May God help you.”

I stared at the paper, rereading it over and over. I couldn’t believe this, this can’t be real, this has to be a dream. But it wasn’t. The throbbing pain in my thigh reminded me of that. I wish I had never come here; in fact, I wish I had died with Hank, at least he died smiling and talking to his friend. I’m going to die at the hands of a monster, filled with fear. Hank had it good.

I turned the paper over in my hands, and on the back, on the bottom of the page, was a short list of names. “Thomas, Chris, Karen, Miguel.” I found a pen in the end table by the couch. I then added my name to the list, carefully refolded the note, and returned it to its hiding place.

I returned to my bedroom and began to repack my small suitcase, with the small amount of clothing and personal items I had left. Being sure to put my wallet and truck keys in my pocket. I pulled my dead iPhone and the charger from the home in the nightstand, and put them on top of my clothes before zipping up the suitcase. I then enjoyed a hot shower, the only bit of relaxation I’d had in days. Roughly 10 minutes later, I heard the loud engine of the ATV. Ward was here. I stood by the door, suitcase in hand, waiting to hear Ward’s voice. He threw the machine into park, and though the loud noise of the engine remained, I could hear the branches breaking and bushes moving.

“Nate, get out here! We've got to go!”

 Taking a deep breath, I swung the door open and stepped into the morning light. The porch was damp and stained with blood, but Sarah’s body had been placed high in a tree, in a similar way to Reg’s. Ward sat on the ATV 10 feet from the porch. As I stepped off the last step of the porch, the loud, angry scream echoed throughout the forest.

 “Get on, now!” screamed Ward.

 I closed the distance and hopped on the back. The vehicle sprang to life as Ward hit the accelerator quickly. He quickly performed a U-turn, and as he did, the large body of a dead elk was thrown our direction; it barely missed us and slammed violently against the stairs of the porch. The screaming continued, but as we pushed down the trail, the sound faded. The ATV covered the distance to headquarters in a little more than 20 minutes, something that had taken me a whole morning less than a week ago. Yet I knew the seven miles wasn’t going to be far enough.

As we pulled into the makeshift parking lot, Ward looked over his shoulder at me and said,

“Go inside quickly.”

 I ran into the small building, and he followed. Slamming and locking the door, he turned to me, looking into my eyes, he said,

“I’m truly sorry, Nate. I assigned you to Reg, hoping he would show you firsthand how to avoid the beast.”

 He paused, running a hand through his dark hair,

“I should have done this myself. This is my fault, and I’m sorry.”

 I looked at him and saw a brave man, a quiet guardian, who clearly was burdened by lives he felt responsible for.

“It’s not your fault, sir.” I said, “It would have killed Reg, whether or not I knew, and it killed Sarah because I wouldn’t open the door, none of this is your fault.”

 He stared at the floor for a moment, then looked back at me.

 “This is my post, Nate. Everything that happens here is my fault. But thank you for your words.”

I nodded, “Sure thing.”

He moved to his office and sat at the desk. I followed.

“You have to go, Nate.” He said, “You need to spend the rest of your life surrounded by as many people as you can.”

“Where do I go, sir?” I weakly said.

He shook his head, “I don’t know, somewhere far, and with lots of people. Stick to the big cities.”

I nodded slowly, “If I have to, I will.”

“Good.” He approved, and he opened a drawer from the desk, pulling out a checkbook. “Now, the National Park Service has an off-the-books fund to help rangers and their next of kin, when something like this happens. I’m writing you a check for $5,000 and will spend another $5,000 to the next of kin of your choosing.

“Spend it to my mom.” I said, “She’s my emergency contact on file.""

He nodded, “We’ll do that, here, take yours, and you'd better get a move on.” He reached out to shake my hand. “Stay alive, son.”

“I’ll try,” I said, as our hands shook for the last time. I then took the check and suitcase, and ran to the truck, and turned the key.

The open road was comforting to me; the HideBehind was fast on foot, but it couldn’t match highway speeds. With each passing moment, I felt lighter, as if I had awakened from a nightmare, and every moment reaffirmed reality and disproved the dream. I could breathe again. The road had given me new life, hope, maybe I would live, perhaps I wouldn’t be like the others. How could the creature follow me now? “I escaped,” I muttered aloud as a quiet chuckle left my lips. I soon realized just how exhausted I was. It had been days since I had had a full night's sleep, and the constant adrenaline of the last few days had shot my system. My mind turned towards finding a decent bed, so as I pulled into a small town near the Idaho border, I located the parking lot of a Best Western hotel, and headed to the front desk. Entering my room on the third floor, I throw the deadbolt and crashed hard on the soft bed. Morning came, and with it a false sense of security; the night had been completely ordinary. No screaming and pounding at the door, no evidence that I had been followed. I took a deep breath and smiled. I had gotten away, I was going to live, I certainly didn’t doubt that the HideBehind was real, but I doubted it was still hunting me, just like an escaped convict doesn’t doubt the police are real; he just doubts they will find him. I had gotten away, I was in the wind, and the Creature wasn’t coming. All these thoughts boosted my ego as I headed down to enjoy my complimentary hotel breakfast. The breakfast was amazing. I devoured plate after plate of powdered eggs, microwaved sausage patties, and cheap cinnamon rolls. I ate so much that the hotel staff began to eye me with judgment, but I didn’t care. 24 hours earlier, I thought I would never eat again, so I ignored their stares and continued eating. Entering my truck, I realized I had no real plan. I wasn’t entirely sure where I was going or what I was going to do, but for the time being, I wasn’t bothered by this. I was going to drive until a plan formed itself. Finding the highway again, I headed toward Idaho.

Just a quick PSA, if you are ever on a long road trip, never, and I mean never, eat the free breakfast at a Best Western Hotel. I hadn’t even been on the road an hour when the powdered eggs and cinnamon rolls mixed into a thick cement in my gut and threatened to burst at any moment. The first major truck stop in Idaho was my only refuge. I sped into the parking lot, barely holding on, and the truck had hardly stopped moving by the time I had entered the rest stop. It was quiet and empty; apparently, not a lot of people were on the road here in Idaho on a Tuesday morning. I ran to the men’s room and sighed with relief when I saw the restroom was empty. I didn’t want anyone to witness what was about to happen. Moments later, the storm had passed, and as I stood to exit the stall, the door to the bathroom swung open. I expected the sound of shoes on tile as a new patron entered the room, but instead, the sound I heard was that of large bare feet slapping against the floor, accompanied by the clicking of long claws meeting the ceramic tiles. It was here. I held my breath as the massive skeleton-like feet slowly moved along the row of stalls. The HideBehind came to a stop directly outside the stall I was in. Its feet pointed toward me as it stared at the little door between us. Heavy wet breathing filled the bathroom. All went silent. Then its fist rocked the little door, “LOOK. AT. ME.” came its inhuman voice. Long claws scraped against the thin steel wall of the box that enclosed me. it rattled and shook the door violently, hoping it would come loose, but the lock held. It went silent, only its heavy breathing filled the room, then after a moment. One thin gray arm stretched over the top of the stall and slithered down the side, searching for the lock. Its fingers inched closer to the lock; it was barely out of reach, but its claws knocked against the bolt as it sought to knock it loose. The bolt moved slightly, then the claws hit it again; it moved. Soon, it would be knocked free. I screamed as I realized the door wouldn’t remain locked much longer. Just then, the bathroom door swung open again, and in an instant, the HideBehind had hidden itself behind the last stall in the row, as a heavyset man in cowboy boots entered the bathroom. I took my opportunity, flung the stall open, and dashed past the man who had saved me on my way to the parking lot. I sped down the highway, as my sweaty hands gripped the steering wheel, the hopelessness of my situation had returned. What do I do? Where do I go? I didn’t know; all I knew was I needed to keep driving. I wasn’t stopping till Idaho was behind me. Several hours later, after passing over the Rocky Mountains and entering the northern Great Plains of central Montana, I pulled the truck off to the side of the highway. I couldn’t stop my hands from shaking. My experience at the truck stop made me realize just how awful my situation was. The HideBehind wasn’t limited to the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest. This realization terrified me; no matter where I went, it would follow, just like Ward had said. I was exhausted by the idea, seeking freedom, I found a permanent chain on my life. A constant eye upon my life, a constant threat. Reality brought tears to my eyes, and dread filled me. It hardly seemed the effort to keep going. In the middle of a barren highway in Montana, I wept, not for the friends I had lost, not for Reg, or Sarah, or for the mess I left on Ward, no, selfishly, I wept for myself.  The monster had claimed my life, and out of cruelty, it had left me alive. And so I sat and mourned the life I would never have. 10 maybe 20 minutes passed before I looked out my window at the vast, desolate prairie all around me. it was beautiful, though empty.

I saw the birds that called this wasteland their home, the poor creatures; they will never know the abundance of the coast or the mountaintop. All they have ever known is roadkill and the leftover McDonald's fries thrown from a car window. Life had dealt these birds a bad hand. Yet as I watched, I saw that these birds didn’t despise their situation; rather, they made the most of it. I had been dealt a bad hand, and crying about it wasn’t going to improve anything; maybe it was time for me to make the most of this, maybe it was time for me to take a stand. I pulled out the old United States road map that rested in the side compartment of the driver's door. And after a moment, pinpointed my location. As I did, I clicked on the truck's radio and dialed into the local country station. The music soothed my nerves as I studied the map. I needed to get to a city, and I had to go far. The further the better, my eyes scoured the wrinkled paper, and as my eyes moved to the eastern seaboard, it became obvious. New York City. It had people, and it was on the other side of the nation. It was perfect, I would go to New York. As I moved to locate a pen to mark the route to the Big Apple, the music on the radio was interrupted by a clear, smooth male voice that spoke over the airwaves:

“Breaking News, police are searching for any information related to a murder this morning on the Washington-Idaho border. 53-year-old Bill Foster, a local trucker, husband, and father, was found decapitated in a bathroom at a truck stop just east of the border. Local authorities are asking anyone who has any information regarding this case to please call your local sheriff's office.”",1,1770830958.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1r23kxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1r23kxw/parking_tips_for_und_mens_hockey_vs_miami_ohio_at/,Parking tips for UND Mens Hockey vs Miami Ohio at Ralph Engelstad Arena (Grand Forks 02/13),"  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the und vs miami ohio game at the ralph on 02/13. parking around here is usually a total zoo for hockey, especially since the actual on-site lots at the arena are all reserved for champions club members, so regular fans have to find other spots and walk in.  
  
honestly, you should check out Prked first before you even head toward the arena. you can basically rent a driveway or a private spot right next to the ralph from a local for the night. it is way cheaper than the official university lots, and it lets you skip the massive traffic jam on gateway drive and columbia road when the game lets out. plus, it usually means a much shorter walk, which is a big deal when the grand forks wind is hitting you in mid-february.  
  
if you decide to use the official und campus lots, there are a few options but they all cost a bit. the cheapest one is the harvard lot behind archives coffee shop for ten dollars, but it is credit card only via the text2park system. the med school lot and the bronson center lot west of casey's are fifteen dollars, and the wellness center lot is the most expensive at twenty dollars and is usually cash only. for any of the lots that use text2park, you will need to text 25023 with the specific lot code on the sign to pay. these lots start filling up as early as five pm, so do not wait until seven pm to look for a spot.  
  
another good backup is the und parking ramp at the corner of university avenue and columbia road. it is usually seven dollars for the night and it is a bit more protected from the weather than the surface lots. if you are really trying to save money, the city ramps downtown like the corporate center ramp are free after five pm on weekdays. it is a long walk from downtown, but you could always park there for free and grab a quick rideshare to the southwest entrance of the arena where the designated drop-off is.  
  
be really careful if you try to park on the residential streets south of the ralph. grand forks is super strict about winter parking and snow removal routes. if you park on the wrong side of the street or in a maintenance zone between one am and six am, they will tow you without thinking twice. also, north columbia road becomes a complete standstill starting around six fifteen pm, so try to arrive early and maybe grab a drink at one of the spots like the canad inns or downtown bars that run shuttles to the game. hope this helps and enjoy the game.",1,1770830799.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

We have a monthly get together for the younger crowd (think like 25-35, not a perfect science ofc, I am 28F) to hang out once a month for a meetup to be social, meet people, do our hobbies together (write a book, crochet, craft, play card games, etc.) in a casual capacity. We've now met twice and we had even more people at the 2nd meetup than the first, and it's going great! 

We will be having our third meeting at [Friendly's in Berwyn](https://www.friendlymusic.community/) (very close by) at 3pm on Saturday, March 14. We have a [partiful link ](https://partiful.com/e/LmPQXu93VDpIT5Tks0NC)for RSVP so we can plan to be the most respectful to Friendly's.

1r23ieq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r23ieq,Am I being too sensitive?,"I’m completely open to being totally wrong, but I’m looping and need some input that isn’t my own brain screaming at me. 

Context: 

My husband (32m) and I (30f) have been married a year and together for 7. I was diagnosed AuDHD 2 years ago. I’m medicated and go to regular therapy. He recently went to his first therapy session and has been quite down.. I know how hard it can be so I did everything in my power to comfort him. 

The week sucked so that weekend I suggested we go get breakfast to try take his mind off of things and to get out of the house. He agreed and off we went. In an attempt to make small talk I told him how proud I was of my nails I’d recently done (it’s a hobby and creative outlet I have) he engaged a bit and said he liked the colour and then he asked me “what’s the difference between the nails you do and the nails the salon does” I laughed and said well these cost nothing? He responded “no. I mean why is their base so smooth but yours never looks shiny and smooth, it’s bumpy/wavy” 

I told him it’s hard to do my non dominant hand and that I was a little rushed with this set because he’s turned the TV off and wanted to go to bed. Admittedly I may have come across a bit defensive… I was embarrassed because we were heading into a public setting and I immediately tucked my hands away and said “I’ll hide my nails.. I didn’t realize they were that bad…” 

He turned the car around and said “that’s it I’m not going to breakfast and suffering through this with you, you’ve just ruined it.” I tried to backpedal (we were basically at the cafe) and I said no it’s okay! I’m just being a little butthurt… he’d had enough though and said I’m too sensitive. Somewhere along the line be asked how I would have liked to hear the criticism instead, and I plainly stated that when I’m excited about something I’m not actively looking for criticism or feedback, and if it’s not hurting anyone that it would be nice if he could just let me be happy. He said he needed to say something because my nails and appearance affect him as he sees them every day. I was really shocked that he said this and he followed it up with “I wish I was in a relationship with someone that could take criticism it would make my life a lot easier” (along those lines, I’m a bit blurry) 

We got home and I just shut down. I think we tried hashing it out a bit, him telling me I need to work on my rejection sensitivity in therapy and that I need to work on receiving criticism and taking it less personally, eventually I said something like this isn’t going anywhere I don’t feel like arguing let’s pause it. We didn’t speak for the rest of the day and went about the day doing our own things. He went to his PC and watched YouTube while I went and cried like a baby in bed. He eventually came to bed and scrolled memes / napped until it was time for bed. Never said a word to me. 

When we got ready to sleep, I last minute chose to sleep on the couch instead. It really bugged me that he couldn’t accept that I was proud of my nails to the point where he would rather say he didn’t want to be in this relationship. He just seems to have lost his capacity to tolerate me these days. 

It’s been 4 days of the silent treatment and me sleeping on the couch. It’s not like he’s actively making me sleep there but the environment just feels so hostile I don’t feel welcome in the bedroom.

We don’t speak other than me asking if he wants coffee or that his dinner is ready, I’ve continued with my normal routine, work, care for our dog, cook dinner, manage the house, etc. but I just can’t bring myself to go back to the bedroom and sleep in the same bed as him. 

Usually we’d have made up by now (me starting the conversation and apologizing) but I can’t seem to get to that point and I’m not sure if it’s because I’m being a stubborn mule, or if it’s because there’s something underlying. 

I’m open to honest feedback and if I’m in the wrong I’ll be the first to apologize. 

I’ve attached a picture of the nails that started this whole thing. If they’re really that bad I’ll remove them tonight along with the apology.",20,1770830647.0,Marriage,66,0.78,False

After moving to the UAE, I noticed something that honestly stayed with me. The biggest difference between founders here (and in the West in general) and in Pakistan isn’t funding or resources. It’s community. People actually meet. They grab coffee. They talk openly about what’s working and what’s not. They collaborate without overthinking. There’s no weird ego around “how much are you making?” or “what stage are you at?” It’s just builders being around other builders.

In Pakistan, especially Karachi, we have insane talent. Smart devs, strong marketers, creative people, young founders trying wild ideas. But most of us are building in isolation. Everyone is grinding quietly. Either you’re “too small” to feel included somewhere, or you feel like you don’t fit unless you’ve already made it. And that honestly doesn’t make sense.

So I want to build something chill. A small, real community of founders and creators from Pakistan who just want to connect, meet, talk, and help each other grow. You don’t need to be making millions. You don’t need to have raised funding. Even if you’re at zero but serious about building and learning, you’re welcome. This isn’t some elite club. It’s a circle where you can talk about your ideas, your problems, your wins, your confusion, whatever you’re figuring out right now.

The goal is simple: real connections. Offline meetups. Coffee. Conversations. Maybe collaborations. Maybe friendships. No fake networking energy. No selling courses. No “bro let me pitch you something.” Just good people trying to build good things.

And one important thing — I will personally make sure this space feels safe and comfortable for females as well. No weird behavior, no awkward vibes, no tolerance for nonsense. If we’re building a community, it has to feel respectful and relaxed for everyone.

If you’re building something and you want to be around other builders from Pakistan, comment or DM me and I’ll share the group link. Let’s actually create the kind of startup circle we wish existed.",7,1770830632.0,karachi,3,0.77,False

It was just the three of us no adults. Nothing was planned, I just wanted to spend time with him because we rarely got to meet.

As soon as I arrived, my boyfriend started making sexual advances, which already made me uncomfortable. Then his best friend kept insisting I drink bottled cold coffee. I said no multiple times because I don't usually eat or drink at other people's houses. They kept pushing.

What felt odd was that neither of them drank it, even though my boyfriend loved cold coffee and was a total foodie. dude literally are a sandwich off the school playground and was always sneaking in snacks. dude used to steal my lunchbox. Earlier, during our friend-zone phase, this same guy used to joke things like: ""Put sleeping pills and viagra in her drink and she won't even notice."" I brushed it off back then as stupid dark humor. i was a dumb teen aswell so i didn't know much.

But in that moment, my intuition was screaming don't drink it. So I didn't.

Nothing happened that day, but years later, now that I understand consent, coercion, and safety better, this memory keeps replaying in my head.

I don't know if I was being set up to be drugged or if it was just teenage boys being sexually pushy and creepy but I know the situation felt unsafe, and my gut reaction was intense.

after that, his bestfriend was trying to make me stay away from my then boyfriend. he said you don't deserve him and all that crap. you deserve better and all..

at that time also my gut was screaming, did they add in some drvgs, or viagra, or alcohol.. cuz they were so sketchy about everything

My diet, mostly consist of coffee, water, sparkling water, as well as being on the paleo diet. I was intermittent fasting from 8 PM to noon, which helped control my hunger and my snacking.

I want to be efficient and I want this TRZ to be as effective as possible.

My issue is, I’m not sure how to schedule my eating and my lifting routine. I’ve read “eat all carbs before noon”, and i know protein intake is imperative. 

Do i continue fasting? Do i continue calorie deficit and tracking macros?

1r239y1,https://www.reddit.com/r/veilance/comments/1r239y1/anodic_backpack_bought_return_story/,Anodic Backpack Bought & Return Story,"I have a Nomin and a Granville 16 plus a shameful number of other bags so was, of course, very excited when the Anodic was announced. For context I love minimal bags and currently use the Granville daily. In my eyes, it's a clear Nomin successor and really just a mini Nomin. 

I ran down to the Arc store and bought both the Gnosis and Black and took them home to have a good look. Long story short: I'm going to keep using the Granville and retuned both Anodics.

Some things I noticed. 

The new fabric is lovely. It's heavily textured and has a beautiful look. The Gnosis is too green for my taste but the Black is great. 

The bag is very rectangular. It's basically a cube with only the slightest dip in the top. The Granville's width tapers toward the bottom; the Anodic does not. The Granville / Nomin have a dome shape; the Anodic does not. So it looks quite big and bulky both resting and on the back. Might be someone's fav but it didn't resonate with me. That said, it felt big and the space was very usable.

The design is... only ok. The Nomin had a lot of flaws and I was very hopeful that this would address them. The Granville certainly did. The Anodic mostly does but adds new ones I feel. The main compartment is very big and has a tiny mesh zip area at the top with two drop pouches underneath. I appreciate the light, low-profile design but it's not super useful. The laptop compartment is weirdly big. It has its own volume and you could put other things in there which I don't need or want. The laptop pouch isn't good unfortunately. It's mesh with an elastic. So you are fighting to get your device out of that slot every time you use it. The little side pocket is not useful. It's very small and a tight fit so your hand rubs on the zip every time you use it. The straps are long and dangle (why get rid of something the Nomin did right?!). And, for me, I didn't find the bag comfortable on the back. My Granville has been all over the world with me and I barely notice it. The Anodic felt like I was wearing a brick with the same load (for ref: 14"" laptop, charging kit bag, shell, mid, a bunch of small stuff, box of coffee I was bringing home). 

Maybe I was too impatient? Should I have given it more time? Which brings me to the price. For that money I need to love it immediately. It doesn't matter that I can afford it. It's a crazy price for a bag and so I need to feel it's got lots of value, utility and beauty. And it only kind of did for me. 

Unlike my Granville! Which I think has bags of value, utility and beauty. It's a tiny bit smaller than I'd love (make it 18?) but otherwise it's just an ideal minimalist bag.

My local roaster recently started offering a few experimental microlot options for a limited time, and I've just happened to run out of my previous two bags from them, so now I'm stuck choosing between two that look especially interesting to me.

Both are Colombia Campo Ermoso, but:

\- One is black honey lactic process with pineapple, pistachio ice cream and sage notes

\- The other one is blueberry co-fermentation process, with blueberry, syrup and lollipops notes

Now, what I like in coffee is clarity, complexity, light body, some sweetness and balanced acidity (which of course can be adjusted with grind size). And obviously I brew pourover, if that even needs mentioning (v60, to be specific)

My main questions/concerns are:

\- Does the pineapple flavor profile mean lots of acidity?

\- Some sources online claim that lactic process adds dairy-like notes, which sounds interesting, however it's not listed in the flavor profile - should I expect it?

\- Is co-fermentation a good thing in my case, or will it just taste like coffee with blueberry flavor added to it? Is this generally something worth trying in the first place, or can it be risky?

I would of course get both coffees since I usually get two bags of 250g and drink 2 cups a day, but I want one of the coffees I get to have more traditional flavor profile, plus those microlots are twice the price for less beans, so I'm a bit hesitant about buying both, especially since I fear I won't like what I get (hence the questions I'm asking)",0,1770829893.0,pourover,1,0.5,False

He answers all my questions with 1 word answers. 
""Yes"". ""No teacher."" ""Eat"". ""Coffee"". ""I don't know"". 

I try to encourage more and he will never give more than a simple sentence.

- ""Why not?""
- ""I don't know"". 

It's not for a lack of understanding as he has good comprehension skills and if he doesn't understand we write down the questions etc or look at other ways he can answer or give longer answers but he just puts in 0 effort.

(Throwaway acct, because my partner’s here). I’ve been in the ENM lifestyle for 10 yrs, and have 2 other relationships, but not quite with the BDSM structure I want. 

I, G, (F 36) went on an amazing first date with Q, (M 34), this past weekend and it was amazing.. One of those first dates you read about in elevated smut where things just seemed like they flowed well from the jump. We met for coffee and in minutes our connection was smoldering. 

I’m the type of person that’s well put together,  controlled and discerning, so I’m actively seeking out BDSM relationship for my primary dynamic. As soon as we sat down, I could feel his presence and energy and it felt great. His approach to the relationship type I wanted was fresh, real and the vibes were strong. We even got into some very subtle coffee shop appropriate play, testing each other out. We were driving each other wild and had all the sexy times ideas flowing. I might have finally found a worthy Dom that I could submit to.  

We shared cutlery (he fed me from his fork - also hot) before I disclosed that I had HSV-2. At that point he laughed and said he had HSV-1. Then things took a slight turn. He explained about his medical situation where he’s a medical unicorn, so he’s pretty careful about potentially contracting HSV-2, especially since he gets outbreaks from HSV1 often.  I’ve had this for years, without being sure of where I got it, and been on daily antivirals. Talked to doctors about treatment, potential transmission etc. I’m on antivirals, my current other partners have come to understand risks and as far as I know, haven’t transmitted to them. 

I know it’s his choice of how and who he wants to date, and what risk acceptance he wants in his life, but I’m struggling with the fact that he’s pretty firmly no-go on sexy contact with me. It feels heartbreaking that the universe would put such a great potential in front of me and just yank it in minutes. 

Are there any resources that can help me kill my sadness, or any HSV resources that can compare living with this?  Am I just to wallow in my sad feels of lost potential? Help me internets! I’m big sad.

We started our slushy February at Village Ice Cream this month. 

https://preview.redd.it/i8npyhf62tig1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a5e2709010a2009323e7ae4da5777bb14578f85

As a coffee lover myself I must praise Biscoffee, a classic pairing of coffee and Biscoff cookies which I fully admit is a delight I often find myself partaking to at home. Well shut the coffee maker and wipe up your cookie crumbs because Village has rolled them into a vegan ice cream, it also pairs well with their next flavour too if you are a double scoop type of person. Salted Honey is a perfect salty/sweet combo with it's rich and yet subtle smooth and creamy texture that will get your tastebuds buzzing! If you prefer your ice cream to be more busy like a bee, we will recommend you Funky Monkey, with chocolate and bananas being shadowed by fudgy brownies, walnuts and even mini Marshmallows!

If you are looking for something fresher and more summery with all the warm weather we've been having, Strawberry Milk Tea is a nice gluten friendly and vegan option that balances tart strawberries and black tea with tiny notes of balsamic glaze into this bright and tangy flavour.

We headed down to Hillhurst in a hurry this month because Made by Marcus has listened to us crying over the loss of Passion Fruit Basil, which is our first MBM flavour this month, as this was already one of -Specific\_Cookie-s all time favourites, we have already filled our freezer with pints of this former ""always flavour"". For chocolate lovers I will suggest Chocolate Praline & Pistachio Fudge, which is a combo of chocolate nibs, white chocolate, almond cream and pistachios, very chocolatey, very nutty and very subtlety salty. If the vegans are into chocolate too, it’s ok, MBM has you covered! Vegan Black Sesame Chocolate Truffle, is a big on flavour offering that we admit may not be for everyone, the sesame flavour may be overpowering to some but I personally quite liked the chocolate mixed with it, a classic MBM quirky flavour that we expect!

Lastly we have a seasonal favourite, we know it is because it has been featured nine times at this parlour, Raspberry Rose Lychee, it is a great one, a perfect balance of the trio of flavours where nothing is predominantly ""in charge"" when it hits your tastebuds, raspberry/rose jam rolled into lychee ice cream, there is a reason this is a ""classic"" seasonal flavour!

While the two of us are fine eating without dietary restriction, we have to commend these shops for their vegan and gluten friendly options the last couple months, they have been interesting and really, really satisfying. If you are one of those people who think the vegan options are never as good, both Village Ice Cream and Made by Marcus offer great evidence to change that option! Kudos to these Calgary legends!

figured i-d share some tips for everyone headed to see wayne newton at the clyde theatre on 02/13. parking around quimby village can get pretty crowded for big shows like this and honestly it can be a mess.  
  
the smartest move is probably using Prked to find a spot. you can rent out a private driveway or a garage space from neighbors right next to the venue. it is usually way cheaper than other options and you get to skip the massive line of cars trying to get out of the plaza after the show. it makes for a much quicker getaway and a very short walk.  
  
if you decide to use the official lots there is a 6-acre area right along bluffton road and behind the theatre. it is free and brightly lit but it fills up extremely fast. once that is full they send everyone to the overflow parking at foster park plaza which is the retail center just to the west. since the show starts at 8:00 i would definitely suggest arriving by 6:30 or 7:00 at the latest to find a decent spot without circling for twenty minutes.  
  
another good strategy is getting there early to eat at the club room or crescendo coffee right next door. if you are already there for a meal you can keep your spot for the concert which saves a lot of stress. just watch out for the residential streets nearby because the city is strict about parking on grass or unapproved surfaces especially in february. you also have to be at least 5 feet away from driveways and 20 feet from crosswalks or you might get a ticket from code enforcement. also avoid parking anything over a ton on the street overnight as they can be pretty picky about that.

In addition, Atlanta has cashed the Over in 4 of their last 5 outings, and Charlotte is playing exceptional basketball at the moment. If the Hornets plan on keeping up with the Hawks’ notoriously quick pace (like they did less than a week ago…), this game should cash the Over easily. My money’s on a high-scoring affair.

1r22q37,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerkeyboard/comments/1r22q37/what_is_the_average_lifespan_of_a_keyboard_i/,What is the Average Lifespan of a Keyboard? I looked into every keyboard type so here's the actual answer with real numbers,"Saw this question pop up again and the answers are always vague like ""it depends"" without giving actual numbers. So I went through a bunch of sources, manufacturer specs, and real user experiences to put together a proper breakdown. Not an expert, just someone who uses keyboards daily and got curious.

Here's the real answer.

# Quick Answer

The average lifespan of a PC keyboard is **3 to 10 years** depending on the type. Cheap membrane keyboards last around 1–3 years with heavy use. A quality mechanical keyboard can last **10–15 years** easily, and some models have been going strong for 20+ years. The IBM Model M keyboards from 1984 are still working today — over 40 years later.

# Lifespan by Keyboard Type

**Basic Membrane Keyboards — 1 to 5 years (5–10 million keystrokes)**

These are the standard keyboards that come bundled with desktops or cost $10–$30. They use rubber domes under the keys. The rubber degrades over time, keys start feeling mushy, and eventually some keys stop registering entirely. Heavy typists or gamers will burn through these in 1–2 years. Casual users who just check email and browse can stretch them to 3–5 years. The biggest problem is they're basically unrepairable — when one part fails, the whole thing is done.

**Chiclet / Island-Style Keyboards — 2 to 4 years (3–5 million keystrokes)**

These are the flat, low-profile keys you find on most laptops and some standalone keyboards like the Apple Magic Keyboard. They use a simplified mechanism and are generally less durable than standard membrane keyboards. Laptop keyboards are especially vulnerable because they also deal with heat from the laptop itself, crumbs falling between keys, and they can't be easily replaced without professional repair. If you're a heavy laptop user, expect keyboard issues within 2–3 years.

**Scissor-Switch Keyboards — 3 to 6 years (5–10 million keystrokes)**

A step up from basic chiclet keyboards. Scissor switches provide better stability and key feel. Found on higher-end laptops and standalone keyboards like the Logitech MX Keys. More durable than basic membrane but still not on the level of mechanical. With normal daily use, these hold up well for 3–5 years. Some users report getting 6+ years out of quality scissor-switch keyboards with good maintenance.

**Mechanical Keyboards — 5 to 15+ years (50–100 million keystrokes)**

This is where longevity gets serious. Mechanical keyboards use individual switches under each key, and these switches are built to last. Here's the switch breakdown:

* **Cherry MX switches** — rated for 50–100 million keystrokes
* **Gateron switches** — rated for 50–80 million keystrokes
* **Kailh switches** — rated for up to 80–100 million keystrokes
* **Razer optical switches** — rated for 100 million keystrokes
* **Topre switches** — rated for 50 million+ keystrokes
* **Turtle Beach TITAN II Optical** — rated for 200 million keystrokes

To put those numbers in real terms: the average person types about 10,000–12,000 keystrokes per day. Even at the heaviest usage, 50 million keystrokes on your most-pressed key translates to roughly **7–10 years**. At 100 million keystrokes, you're looking at **15–20+ years** of daily use before that switch wears out.

And here's the kicker — if a switch does die, you can replace just that one switch (especially on hot-swappable keyboards) instead of throwing away the whole keyboard. Keycaps can be swapped too. Cables are usually detachable. Mechanical keyboards are basically the ""ship of Theseus"" of peripherals — you can replace every part over time and keep the same board going indefinitely.

**Premium / Custom Mechanical Keyboards — 10 to 20+ years**

High-end builds with aluminum or brass cases, quality stabilizers, premium switches, and PBT keycaps are essentially built to last a lifetime. The only things that wear out are keycaps (PBT lasts way longer than ABS) and switches, both of which are replaceable. The PCB, case, and plate can last decades. People in the custom keyboard community regularly use boards that are 10–15 years old with no issues.

# Lifespan Comparison Table

|Keyboard Type|Average Lifespan|Keystroke Rating|Repairable?|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Basic Membrane|1–5 years|5–10 million|No — replace whole unit|
|Chiclet / Island-style|2–4 years|3–5 million|Difficult / expensive|
|Scissor Switch|3–6 years|5–10 million|Limited|
|Entry Mechanical|5–10 years|30–50 million|Yes — switches replaceable|
|Mid-Range Mechanical|8–15 years|50–80 million|Yes — fully modular|
|Premium Mechanical|10–20+ years|80–100+ million|Yes — every part replaceable|

# What Actually Kills Keyboards (It's Usually Not the Switches)

Most keyboards don't die because the switches wore out. Here's what actually kills them:

**Dust and debris buildup** — Crumbs, hair, dust gets under the keys over time and causes keys to stick, feel scratchy, or stop registering. This is the #1 keyboard killer and it's completely preventable with basic cleaning.

**Liquid spills** — A single coffee spill can kill even an expensive keyboard instantly. Some membrane keyboards are spill-resistant but most aren't truly waterproof. Mechanical keyboards can sometimes be saved if you unplug immediately, disassemble, clean with isopropyl alcohol, and let it dry completely.

**Cable failure** — On wired keyboards, the USB cable can wear out from bending, pulling, or rolling over with chair wheels. Keyboards with detachable USB-C cables solve this problem since you just swap the cable.

**Keycap wear** — Cheap ABS keycaps get shiny and the legends (letters) fade or rub off within 1–2 years of heavy use. PBT keycaps are much more resistant to this and can last 5–10+ years without visible wear. Double-shot keycaps where the legend is a separate piece of plastic will literally never fade.

**PCB / electronics failure** — The circuit board inside the keyboard can fail due to humidity, power surges, or manufacturing defects. This is rare in quality keyboards but common in ultra-cheap ones. More of a lottery than a wear-and-tear issue.

**RGB LED burnout** — If your keyboard has backlighting, the LEDs typically last about 50,000 hours. With heavy use (10+ hours/day), that's roughly 6–8 years before individual LEDs start dimming or dying. The keyboard itself still works fine, just some lights go out.

# How to Make Your Keyboard Last Longer

**Clean it regularly** — Pull keycaps off every few months and blow out dust with compressed air. Wipe down with isopropyl alcohol. This alone can double your keyboard's lifespan.

**Don't eat over your keyboard** — Sounds obvious but crumbs are the enemy. They get under keys and cause sticking and misregistration.

**Use a keyboard cover or dust cover** — When you're not using it, cover it. Keeps dust out. Cheap silicone covers work fine.

**Don't bottom out hard** — If you type like you're angry at every key, you're putting more stress on switches and shortening their life. Lighter typing extends longevity, especially on mechanical switches.

**Get a keyboard with a detachable cable** — Cables are the most common failure point on wired keyboards. Detachable USB-C means you swap a $5 cable instead of replacing a $100+ keyboard.

**Choose PBT keycaps over ABS** — PBT is thicker, more durable, and doesn't develop that gross shine. Most mechanical keyboards $50+ come with PBT keycaps now.

**Lube your stabilizers and switches** — For mechanical keyboard users, lubing reduces friction between parts. Less friction = less wear = longer life. Plus it sounds and feels way better.

**Keep drinks away** — Seriously. One spill and it's over. Use a bottle with a cap, not an open mug.

# When to Replace Your Keyboard (Signs It's Dying)

* Keys registering double inputs (pressing ""a"" once types ""aa"") — this is called key chatter and means the switch is degrading
* Keys that need to be pressed harder than before to register
* Some keys just stop working entirely
* The keyboard feels mushy or unresponsive compared to when it was new
* Visible corrosion or damage on the PCB (if you open it up)
* Keycap legends are completely worn off and you can't see what you're typing
* Wireless keyboard holds charge for way less time than it used to

# Is It Worth Spending More for a Longer-Lasting Keyboard?

Short answer: yes, up to a point.

A $15 membrane keyboard that lasts 2 years costs you $7.50/year. A $100 mechanical keyboard that lasts 10 years costs you $10/year. But that mechanical keyboard gives you a vastly better typing experience for all 10 of those years, AND you can replace individual parts to extend it even further. The cost-per-year argument actually favors mechanical keyboards when you factor in that you won't need to replace them.

If you type a lot for work, game regularly, or just want something that feels good and lasts — spend $50–$150 once and you're set for a decade. If you just need something for occasional use, a $20–$30 membrane will do the job for a few years.

# TL;DR

|Question|Answer|
|:-|:-|
|Average keyboard lifespan overall?|3–10 years depending on type|
|Cheap membrane keyboard?|1–3 years heavy use, up to 5 light use|
|Good mechanical keyboard?|10–15 years, some go 20+|
|What kills keyboards fastest?|Spills, dust, cheap cables|
|How to make it last longer?|Clean regularly, don't spill drinks, use PBT keycaps|
|Worth spending more?|Yes — $100 mech outlasts three $30 membranes and feels better|

1r22pgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1r22pgj/barcelona_vs_valencia_i_lived_in_both_3_months_so/,Barcelona vs Valencia : I lived in both 3 months so here's the real comparison,"3 months Barcelona then 3 months Valencia. I write code for a US company so I needed decent timezone overlap with EST. Tracked all my spending because I'm like that. This question shows up here every week so here's what I actually spent.

Finding an apartment in Barcelona sucked. Took 2 weeks on Idealista. Ended up in Eixample near Passeig de Gràcia, 1BR, €1,270/mo. Monthly total came to about €2,700 with everything (food, metro, coworking at MOB Bailén for €250, gym at DIR for €57, eating out, etc). Valencia was way easier. Found a place in Ruzafa through a Facebook group for €1,020. Monthly total more like €2,400. Thats €900 saved over 3 months. A flight to anywhere basically.

Beer in Barcelona €4.50-5. Valencia €3.50. Coffee about the same. Groceries the same because Mercadona is Mercadona.

Internet both 270mbps fiber. Spain just has this figured out.

Got pickpocketed 5 weeks into Barcelona. Green line (L3), rush hour at Passeig de Gràcia. Someone bumped me, didn't notice my phone was gone until Diagonal. Actually got it back because Find My showed it still in the station, they must have dropped it when they saw it was locked. After that I was checking my pockets every 5 minutes. Always watching my bag in Raval at night. In Valencia I walked home at 1:30am through the center and didn't think about it once. My girlfriend visited for 2 weeks and said the same thing, she felt totally fine walking alone.

Used Wayco in Valencia for coworking, €150/mo. Better than MOB honestly. Newer, less packed in the mornings when I actually work.

I ate at Mercat Central in Valencia like 3x a week. Probably skews my numbers but the food there for the price is stupid good. Barcelona has more international restaurants and fancier options. I mostly cook at home and eat out for lunch though so Valencia worked better for me. There was this spot near my apartment, Bar Ricardo, menú del día €12 with wine. Same thing in Barcelona runs €15-16 and its usually worse.

Went out way more in Barcelona the first 6 weeks. More people, more events, more stuff on Meetup and Lemon. Valencia is smaller. More local. More Spanish which was harder for me since my Spanish is mid. Got invited to some things through the Wayco community but its a different energy.

The thing nobody warns you about is how the tourists in Barcelona grind you down over time. Even Gràcia which is supposed to be the local neighborhood has segway tours going through it now. In Valencia I went days without feeling like a foreigner in a tourist trap. Sounds like nothing but 3 months in it matters a lot.

I'm back in Valencia now writing this. Do with that information what you want. Barcelona is a great city I'm not trashing it. But for sitting down and getting work done every day without burning cash or getting stressed out, this worked better for me.

I don’t know what woke me. I just opened my eyes and the house felt… wrong. Too quiet. Like the air itself was holding still.

That’s when I saw him.

At the foot of my bed.

His back was turned to me.

Daniel.

He wasn’t moving. Not really. Just breathing. Slow. His shoulders rising and falling under his shirt. I could hear the fabric shift every time he inhaled. It was quiet, but in the silence of my room it sounded loud.

Like he was pulling the air in. Like he was smelling it.. Smelling me.

I tried to scream but Nothing came out. My throat tightened and I pushed harder, but it was like my body wouldn’t let me make a sound.

Then he stopped breathing completely.

His shoulders froze mid rise.

The room went so still it felt heavy.

And then I woke up.

I shot up in my bed, gasping. My shirt was damp. My heart was racing so hard I could feel it in my ears. The room was dark, normal, empty.

No one standing there.

I just sat there for a minute, trying to calm down. It was a dream. Just a dream.. but it didn’t feel like one.

I’ve never had a dream about someone like that before. Not where it felt so physical. So close.

I don’t know why he’s getting in my head like this. I barely know him. It’s not normal to feel this stressed over someone who just moved in across the street.. right?

And I know looking up that missing person case didn’t help. I shouldn’t have done that. I shouldn’t have compared the pictures.

It’s like my brain is trying to connect things that probably don’t even connect.

Eventually I forced myself to get up.

The second my foot touched the floor, I felt something under it.. Grainy.

I looked down, There was dirt on my floor.

Not a lot. Not enough to panic over. Just small pieces. Scattered near the edge of my bed.

I just stood there staring at it. It didn’t make sense, but it also did.

I told myself it was probably from my own shoes. Maybe I tracked something in earlier and didn’t notice. I don’t always take them off right at the door. It could’ve been from days ago. It could’ve been anything.

I crouched down and rubbed it between my fingers. It was dry. Fine. Like soil.

For a second, something cold moved through my chest, but I shut it down immediately.

I grabbed a tissue and cleaned it up.

That was it. No spiraling. 

I tried to have a regular day.

I made coffee. Stood at the counter longer than I needed to. Scrolled on my phone without reading anything. I almost looked out the front window, but I stopped myself. I didn’t need to see him first thing in the morning.

People have stress dreams all the time. Your brain grabs whatever’s been bothering you and turns it into something dramatic. That’s normal.

The dirt wasn’t proof of anything. It was probably from me. Or from days ago. Or from nothing.

I kept telling myself that.

Around midday I sat on the couch with my laptop and pulled up the missing person article again. I told myself I was just double checking.. Just confirming the details so my brain would stop filling in blanks. 

I kept telling myself to let it go, but that’s not an easy thought to let go of when you start to believe the man living across from you is someone who’s been missing for years.

The same article came up first. Missing during a solo hike. Last seen entering the Pine Hollow Reserve. Search efforts suspended after three weeks. No confirmed sightings since.

But this time I scrolled further.

There were smaller posts. Forum threads. Local Facebook screenshots archived on news sites. A blog someone had written that barely had any views.

James wasn’t the only one. Two other names popped up in the same month he disappeared. Both men. Both mid to late twenties. Both reported missing after separate trips to the same reserve.

Different days. Same trails.

I felt my stomach tighten.

One article mentioned that law enforcement initially believed the cases were unrelated. The area was large. People get lost. People fall. People leave.

One of the reports said investigators briefly considered the possibility that at least one of the men had staged a disappearance. A fresh start. A voluntary runaway. But without proof, they couldn’t confirm anything so of course, two more fairly odd cold cases. 

I kept digging. Clicking older posts. Reading comments from strangers arguing back and forth. Some people swore there had to be someone out there. Others said it was just coincidence, but what if this wasn’t?

I opened James’ missing poster again and zoomed in on his face.

Then I pulled up the memory of Daniel standing at my door.

The Same eyes, nose, mouth..

My heart started beating harder. I didn’t realize how triggering his face was to me given the last few dreadful days in this house alone. 

I stared at the screen for too long.

Then another thought slid in quietly.

If James disappeared in the reserve seven years ago…

Why did Daniel.. or so I say, James move in across the street only a few weeks ago?

Thinking about it within that moment, it made me realize that if that was james that showed up at my door a few days ago, he looked identical to the pictures. It wasn’t just the hair, the eyes or even the facial structure.. He hadn’t aged in the last seven years. 

I clicked on one more archived thread. Someone had mentioned strange activity in the reserve around that time. Unofficial reports. Sounds at night. A “man watching from the tree line.”

The post had been deleted. Only fragments remained.

That was when I shut the laptop harder than I meant to. The sound echoed through the living room.

I told myself I was reaching, but it didn’t feel like reaching anymore. It felt like uncovering something I wasn’t supposed to. 

I rubbed my face, hovering both my hands over my eyes and let out a quiet breath.

“This is crazy,” I muttered to myself softly.

And then I heard it again.

“This is crazy.”

Not loud. Not whispered right into my ear. Just… there.

From somewhere behind me.

For a second my body didn’t react. It was like my brain stalled out, trying to understand what it had just heard. Then I turned too fast, my chair scraping hard against the floor.

My elbow knocked into the glass on the table.

It tipped, Red wine spilled across the wood and onto the floor.

And for a split second, I thought I saw something shift near the window. Not a full shape. Just a darker patch against the dark. Like the rounded edge of something lowering out of view.

I blinked.

The curtains hung still. The glass reflected the kitchen light back at me like it always did.

Nothing was there.

My heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my throat.

“You’re fine,” I said. “You’re fine, it’s nothing.” I repeated until my breathing evened out. 

I grabbed a towel and crouched to clean up the spill. I wasn’t going to stand there trying to prove something to myself.

I wiped the wine from the floor. Rinsed the glass. Put everything back where it belonged.

My paranoia had already seeped in when I checked my front door lock and subconsciously locked my bedroom door behind me when I went to bed. ",1,1770828849.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

The girls giggled. The atmosphere was light-hearted, scented with cheap student wine and snacks, but there was an undertow of dead seriousness. The girls stared intently at Lily, as they waited for the details of her new guy, Paul. She had been on a couple of dates with him, and last night she had slept over at his place. 

Lily shrugged, and sucked her wine. “You guys! It was good, fine. I like him. We’re gonna hang out tomorrow night.” 

The girls gave little shrieks, of approval or disapproval, hard to tell. “Has he texted you since?”

Lily rolled her eyes. “Yes of course! we had breakfast together- he got me coffee- “ 

The girls shrieked softly again- “Ooooh Mr. Generous!” “Morning-after coffee- might as well put a ring on it!” and collapsed into more wine-fuelled giggles. 

Lily felt she needed to offer more. “He wears a scapular- all the time- in bed too!”

There was a moment of silence. Then Tessie asked “What the fuck is a scapular?” But something in the way she asked felt like she knew already. 

Lily answered, nevertheless. “He says it’s a bit of a dead monk shirt- it’s like a piece of rough brown fabric, in a necklace, around his neck. It’s itchy.”

“What a creep-zoid!” exclaimed Sophie. She had got into the habit of adding “zoid” to the end of everything at some point in high school- and never shook it off.

“So the cloth was in your face- all while you were doing it?” asked Bethanne. She was the pervy one. 

Lily shook her head. “No- don’t be ridiculous!”

The girls waited.

“Ok, he took it off and hung it round this crappy old painting of a woman in a veil, by his bed.”

“Ewwwww- Lily- was it his mom?”

“No! What is wrong with you all! Like some historic figure, a saint or something, I think.” 

Bethanne crushed some potato chips loudly, while the rest swiped their phones, their interest in Lily’s sex-life with her new guy already waning.  

Only Tessie seemed still pre-occupied. She dug in her backpack, lying by her feet, and pulled out a small ziploc plastic bag, with herbs inside. Lily thought she was offering her weed. 

Tessie snapped “No Lily, not that. It’s sage and sweetgrass.”

Lily looked blankly at her friend. 

Tessie pushed her face, damp and earnest, close to Lily. “Look. I’m not telling you to not see him, because obviously you are, and it’s not up to me. And there are some good ones, not going to lie. But you have to be careful with those people. Burn some of this next time you're with him - it’s good stuff - sage and sweetgrass purifies, you know. Good vibes.”

“Oh Tessie! Are you back at the occult-y stuff? It’s all those medieval hist courses you’ve been taking!” 

Tessie had gone through a Wiccan phase at high school- but  Lily thought she had outgrown since they had started college. She took the bag of green, and dropped it on her backpack. 

\*\*\*

Back with Paul, lying naked in his narrow student bed waiting while he took a shower, she looked thoughtfully at the framed scrap of brown fabric he had hung up by the picture. It looked innocuous enough. She touched it, disliking the roughness. The woman in the picture looked at her with big sad blue eyes. 

Paul was taking his time in the shower. Bored, she got up, pulled out Tessie’s bag, emptied the contents in an incense-burner, setting it alight. She wafted the sweet smoke towards the scapular. 

The flames leapt higher, and engulfed the scapular. Lily gasped as the scapular for a split second flashed, a tiny scrap of burning light, lighting up the face in the picture, only to then die into thick, stinking smoke. 

She coughed, and at the same time, heard a heavy thump from the bathroom. She froze. The woman from the painting, unharmed, watched her curiously, sadly. The smoke from the now-burnt scapular hung heavily in the small room. She could still hear the shower going. 

“Paul?”

Dread filling her, she walked to the bathroom, and pushed the door open. 

Paul was lying lifeless on the wet floor, the shower still splashing on his body.     ",9,1770828781.0,shortscarystories,1,0.91,False
