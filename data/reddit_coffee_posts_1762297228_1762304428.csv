I’m hoping someone can help me figure this out. I have a 2023 MacBook Pro that’s never had an issue connecting to WiFi anywhere — home, coffee shops, airports, etc.
When I go to my mom’s house, I can’t connect to her WiFi at all. The weirdest part is that the network doesn’t even show up in my list of available networks.

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:
Restarted my MacBook
Restarted her router/modem
Tried connecting manually by typing in the SSID
Confirmed there’s no device limit on her router (we were able to add 4 other devices since)
Verified that my phone, my fiancé’s phone, and my fiancé’s laptop all connect fine

No matter what I do, my MacBook doesn’t see the network at all. Every other nearby WiFi network shows up — just not hers.
Any ideas on what could cause this or how to fix it? 
Thanks in advance!!!",1,1762304354.0,techsupport,0,1.0,False
1oop1dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oop1dg/aita_for_giving_to_charity_when_i_owe_others_money/,AITA for giving to charity when I owe others money?,"My husband (40’sM) and I (40’sF) just got married a few weeks ago, but I’ve been together for almost a decade. For context, I grew up poor. My partner grew up middle class to wealthy. We’ve argued over money before but in recent years I’ve gotten most of my extraneous debt paid off, excluding student loans and one old utility bill. We split all house expenses 50/50. He makes about 50% more than I do. My job is stable, and I’ve been at the same employer since before we met. 

 I’m a bit confused as to how our issue got as heated as it did. We paid for our own wedding, which mostly has been split 50/50 also. During our honeymoon we spent some extra, and he put quite a bit on his credit card. After wedding gifts, I “owe” him about $500 still. It’s only been a few weeks, but the plan had been that the shared expenses that I cover, I would just chip away at the debt by paying the total sum each month. We discussed this prior to the expenses, mostly, but had I known we’d be arguing so soon I would have cut our trip short and just come home.

Today, a local organization made a social media post about offering free admission to families on WIC or SNAP. I shared the article and commented that if any local families that I know personally would like to go, but transportation is an issue, I’d spot them a ten dollar gas card to be able to take their kids. This is something I personally feel strongly about, and it makes me feel good to do things for others. When my partner saw this, he was angry that I’d offer to pay for someone’s attendance when I don’t have him paid back yet. To be fair, I’m not great with money. I’ve had times where he’s covered my half of groceries until payday, or covered something bigger. I don’t have a savings account I can touch. If my car quits, I don’t have cash for a down payment on a new one and only recently (last few years) brought my credit back into “good” standing after years of competing priorities. There’s more details to add here but character limits prevent adding them. 

So we come to today. I don’t know many families that would need to take me up on my offer, but I offered just the same. We are talking probably $10-20 this month, which I’m fine skipping a breakfast out or an expensive coffee a couple times this month (I don’t do that regularly anyway) to cover it. And in my mind, we had a plan for me to pay him back and also pay off my last bit of premarital debt by tax time. He thinks this is an overall indicator of my view of money, and that until I’m in a position to truly have extra, I shouldn’t be giving mine away. I think it’s me giving up a “luxury” or two for a month so someone else could benefit. I won’t be short on bills, and he’s even said I don’t do things for myself very often. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to give money to a community cause, while I still owe him from our honeymoon earlier in the month? If there’s a way I can understand my partner better I’d like to hear some perspectives. ",1,1762304281.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

1oop0bq,https://i.redd.it/be8mv5267czf1.png,First Imperial Century (MTB),"Hi everyone. I'm new, so I'll probably make mistakes when posting, but here goes.

I completed my first imperial century on the weekend, on my Talon 3 mountain bike. The bike isn't modified, factory default. I've been cycling about 7 months, minus a month off injured and a month off for family stuff and laziness.

This post is to give advice to other people who want to try a century, especially on a mountain bike. It wasn't super-easy, but also wasn't super-hard, so if you're thinking about it, I hope this post is helpful and motivating.

 

\- Take a few days off exercise beforehand. My lazy month ended a week before I did this, and in that week I set a few cycling and running PRs. I then took two days off before doing the century. Adequate rest really boosts performance.

\- Get a good breakfast. I had a smoothie with lots of fruit, yogurt, oats, flaxseed, protein powder, and cocoa, with a cup of black coffee.

\- Stay hydrated. I took two 1-litre bottles and kept them full of water with Pocari ion powder (half a pouch per litre for me, but whatever you like). Even a bit of dehydration will sabotage your ride, especially deep into the late miles. Better to be overhydrated than under.

\- Eat regularly, and get sugar. As with hydration, I decided more was more, so snacked on bananas, caramelised sugar lumps, sports jelly, and a few protein bars. Don't wait to crash; if you haven't eaten for 15-20 miles or so, even if you feel okay, top up.

\- Get your saddle height right. I started to feel strain in my right knee joint around 80-90 miles in, possibly from my saddle being too low.

\- Get good shorts. The back of my sack was roasted, red raw, and weeping when I got home. I have bib shorts, but clearly better quality is needed for a ride of this length.

\- Find a rhythm and stick to it. I was doing 14-15mph the entire journey, except for some time in a busy city centre, which cost me some of my average speed. Going out it felt easy, coming back a bit more difficult, but having a more-or-less unchanging rhythm helped me stay mentally and physically in the right flow.

\- Set milestones. It's easier to think 45 minutes ahead than 3 hours ahead. Focus on the next milestone, and psyche yourself up with some self-talk when you hit it.

\- Stay present. As the miles pile up, especially if you're a bit behind on sugar or hydration, your mind will start to wander, or even fry a bit. On a busy road, this could cost you your legs or your life. No daydreaming unless you're somewhere safe.

\- Breaks: up to you. I didn't want any long breaks, as I wanted to keep my muscles warm and my rhythm going. I stopped for 10 minutes at my destination to buy gyoza for my wife; otherwise, just traffic lights, map checks, and 1-3 minute snack and hydration breaks.

\- Enjoy the feeling. Keep hydrating for a while when you get home, and eat whatever the hell you want for dinner. You'll be feeling awesome, so treat yourself.

That's about it. The century was a lot easier than I expected, so I think most cyclists can do it with appropriate nutrition and hydration. Have fun and stay safe!",1,1762304205.0,Strava,0,1.0,False

1ooozem,https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1ooozem/small_wins_that_feel_like_big_wins/,Small wins that feel like big wins,"Last month, I decided to cut down on my phone addiction. Since then, I’ve realized something interesting: when I’m not on my phone, I can’t seem to stay still. I used to think I was just lazy when it came to doing basic tasks, but now I see that without my phone, I struggle to relax because my mind won’t stop racing. It constantly reminds me of everything I need to do, and that feeling of being overwhelmed makes me reach for my phone as a form of comfort.

When I sit on the couch without it, my brain floods with thoughts—what I need to do, who I should call, all the things I’ve been putting off. I get overwhelmed and freeze. Then, almost automatically, I grab my phone and start scrolling for hours without realizing it. Meanwhile, my tasks keep piling up, and that leads to guilt and shame. To escape those feelings, I go right back to my phone for comfort. And so, the cycle continues.

Now, I’ve found a simple but effective solution. When I start to feel overwhelmed, I take a break, breathe in and out, and break my tasks into smaller pieces.

For example, this morning, I woke up and immediately went on my phone—even though I knew I had a lot to do. I felt overwhelmed, but I remembered the promise I made to myself: to limit my screen time, even if it’s just for five minutes. During those five minutes, I realized I had to pee (I’d been holding it for 2–3 hours). After that, I noticed my toothbrush and decided to brush my teeth—which felt like a big accomplishment since I rarely brush when I’m home alone all day.

While brushing, I realized I needed to eat, but I got discouraged when I saw the pile of dishes in the sink. My brain started fighting itself: one part wanted to crawl back into bed and wait until hunger forced me to move, while the other part wanted to get productive. So, I made a compromise—I told myself I’d go back to bed after at least removing the dirty dishes from the sink. Not washing them, just clearing the space so I could clean later.

Once I did that, I ended up making breakfast—toast, eggs, coffee—and somehow, that small start gave me momentum. I even tackled a few chores I’d been putting off for a week. Afterward, I felt a bit tired, so I laid down, but I kept my phone and remote far away from the couch. About 20 minutes later, I started to feel better, and instead of rotting in bed like I normally would, I got up—and before I knew it, I was doing laundry. My brain had completely forgotten about my phone, and I ended up cleaning the entire house.

The only reason I’m on Reddit right now is because I remembered I needed to call my insurance before November—a call I’ve been avoiding for three weeks. But somehow, I ended up scrolling again. I should probably stop now and see what else I can get myself to do.",1,1762304140.0,NonZeroDay,0,1.0,False

So me and my friend, we are both single and we don’t want to go on dating apps, but we want to try real life things: meet them in the park, coffee , outside, anywhere, not through social medias, but the thing is that, boys in suisse are a little bit shy, they will flirt with you ( eye contact) but only a small number of them will actually come and talk to you, so what we are doing is that we started a new initiative, whenever we see boys that are our types, she or me, will go to them and ask for their numbers saying that heyy, my friend over there likes you but she is shy to get your number… and so far, its working, but we just started and didn’t had any dates yet from them, the question is to all the boys living in suisse: would you consider that weird? That we come and make the first step (through a wingwoman) or does that makes us look very easy girls? 

We looking for serious relationships, so I was wondering if this initiative is worthy it or no or we should just wait for when the rights guys will actually come and talk and make their first moves.",0,1762303773.0,askswitzerland,1,0.5,False

**Cup & Coming**

It was just a name, I swear. I thought nothing of it when I made it up. Look, honestly, Baby Cakes was taken, PattiCakes, gone, and we all know what happened to Sprinkles. Props to them for that vending machine idea. I’d like to install one in my house. But seriously, I know it sounds like a porn shop that sells cups of something, and perhaps somewhere it could be, but I promise you, I just sold cupcakes.  

I never set out to do it. I’d lost my job right before the pandemic, and BAM, well, pandemic… 

With unemployment running out and no way to bounce back into telecom when all the mergers had dried up opportunities.  (Sorry, wireless telecommunications, for my youthful readers.) Who needed a VP of sales during what could have been the end of humanity anyway? I guess I could, and hindsight, should have tried going into plexiglass sales, but that’s neither here nor there. I was burnt out anyway and I wanted something new but I needed to survive, without dipping into what I was fortunate enough to have, my savings. 

Baking was always my release. It fills me with utter joy and then the ecstasy of eating the creations… Wait, hmmm, maybe the name wasn’t just a name. I’ll leave it to your imagination. Baking was my therapy, my friend, and for my neighbors who trusted me, it was also their joy. 

I guess it was when I decided to turn on my camera phone, like everyone else who wasn’t overwhelmed with suffering, something glitched the system. 

You would think I invented smell-o-vision, the way people flocked to my TikTok page. I mean, all they could really do was watch me eat them and enjoy.  But then I started sharing some recipes here and there like I was channeling Julia. Man, I remember now, spending so much time watching her as a kid. 

Seems like a lot of things are rushing back at this point. 

I’m not a professional or anything, I just like to bake, but lo and behold I found myself three months into covid signing up at an incubator kitchen, yes, I had to dip into my savings for that, and launching *Cup & Coming.* It took off like a rocket. I don’t know how many small business shot through the roof and remained a top commodity after the pandemic was over but I thank my lucky stars all the time. 

Well, for the business anyway. 

It was the craziest time. I lived nowhere near Hollywood but suddenly I had celebrities shouting out my cupcakes. I loved it. I had to hire people and I loved that even more. At a time when people were desperate for hope I was offering work and packaging little joy bombs and flying them across the country. 

It wasn’t long before I was able to break out of the incubator and open up my own little shop. No, it was not themed with whips and chains and Karma Sutra position wallpaper. But that is a good idea for wallpaper in a bathroom at a porn shop, or a home the owner knows children will never enter. My shop is cute with small round tables and cupcake shaped seats. It’s got charm and playfulness. 

Before I knew it I was on local tv, then several national talk shows, until I was invited to co-host on some cooking competition series. And finally, there I was a Julia of my own, starring in my own short-lived cupcake competition show that was as cute as my establishment. Feels like it was all a dream. 

I grew tired of the hosting gig. I never wanted a spotlight that big. So when the show wasn’t renewed, as they call it, I was happy to walk away,  back to my business life, which had grown from incubator delivery, to one shop, to now, 56 locations around the globe. All without a vending machine. 



**Idle Time**

Did you guess I was a single middle-aged woman with no kids. I have a pup, RobbieLow, that fucking dreamboat from the 80s, whatever happened to him? I got the *puppster* during pandemic as well. So many people were hospitalized and unable to care for their pets.  He was an actually puppy at the time, and he too is a goddamn dreamboat, caramel American Cocker Spaniel. On walks I imagine I am actually Oprah. He even has a cupcake at the shops- Cara-Mel-Low. But that was it, it was me and Robbie against the world. 

I have friends, close, loving, nearby friends and a few scattered around the country. Zooms were key and vital to us all.  My family lives in the south, my sister and my mom, so it was hard to get to see them at all, during the pandemic and after the business started to, pun, eat up all of my time.  I thought I’d move them closer to me after all the money started coming in from the business but as the locations grew and my time became my own again with me not committing myself to a day to day baking schedule I got a little distracted…  

Look I’d been in relationships, long ones, short and sweet Karma Sutra position only ones, but marriage just wasn’t on my rap sheet. 

I loathed the apps. Time after time of bots and fakes and losers.  how much could a joy-bomb loving diva take? But I decided to re-download *The Find* one last time after a friend suggested,”but your life is different now, and The Find is exclusive…” Eye-roll. 

So I did it. And I started going out on these mega dates with these mega fools and fktards. What was so exclusive about the same shit only wealthier. I’ll tell you, nothing!  But before I deleted it for good I got a message from Matthew.

“How about we go for a walk on the beach and by the end of the walk if we have nothing in common we head off in different sunset directions, alone?”  

I mean, who could resist a no-strings sunset stroll. Not me, duh. We didn’t even waste time doing the app chat to death, we just met on the beach. Yes, RobbieLow had to stay home. 

Matthew didn’t have pets. He was also a business owner. He had twin boys, their mom gave birth and took off never to be in contact again. He explained it as, “one had the prospect of being fun and easy to handle but when she found out there were two coming, something kicked in and her overwhelmed perspective negated every prospect of hope for her ability to cope and handle it. It was like her mind shifted to, I have to do all of this alone,” when he was always going to be right there. He wound up getting a default judgement divorce. That’s a detail I learned later in our courtship not then and there on the beach. 

We never walked off into the sunset in different directions. We sat in the sand and watched the sun disappear seemingly under the sea. He walked me to my car and we exchanged info, never to be out of touch again. 





**Under the Sea** 

On paper Matthew was a superstar in his own right. He owned three restaurants, he even had a James Beard award for one. When we met he was launching his first London location. He was never poised to be a tv star, just a proud restauranteur. We have a lot in common. And I was so happy we met when we did as it allowed me time to go with him to undertake the London launch. 

The twins were homeschooled and he had a full-time nanny, well, is it really a nanny once the kids become teens? A full-time family assistant. And I could tell she had been with them long enough to form a true loving bond. They’re gracious and kind boys and I hope they never change.  

Unfortunately, as we arrived in London Matthew got his first taste of my fame. See I’d posted photos of us, our happy times, new beginnings, since we’d been dating for a year. But what I never imagined is our first trip to London as a couple turning into a fan storm. 

It happened so quickly, as we exited the taxi in front of his new restaurant there were about 50 or so people waiting outside, buzzing.  Matthew waved thinking the people were there for him as they blew past him and swarmed me spilling covid tales and thanks for helping them get through.  Some of them had C&C totes or empty boxes for me to sign. You never know what fandom will latch onto. I was thankful and blushing. They’d asked me when I’d be at our London location and of course I gave them a, “tomorrow at 2pm. Hope to see you all there.” Matthew had long disappeared. 

\*\*\*

Opening a restaurant is a lot different from opening a cupcake shop. We’re basically a service counter with a few tables serving up cakes and specialty coffees. There’s no wait staff, rotating chefs, servers that get bored and switched jobs like underwear and delicate, precise preparation vying for awards from a tire company. I’m paraphrasing, but that’s what he said to me in a side corner when I got settled inside. 



I think that was the first time I saw it. Something different, cold, distant, something unearned. 



I’d felt abandoned, was he comparing us? For what reason. We each had our own joy.  For the rest of the day I stayed out of the way. But I listened to everything around me. The swelling costs, the money bleeding out like an open wound. The losing track of time til launch. Their opening date actually had to coincide with the timing of the tire guys or why bother opening at all. Eye roll.  I was glad to not have that in my way. I could focus on what I wanted to focus on and guess what, I was fine with that. 

Unfortunately, I held on to my words that day. It’s a thing I took from an old coworker back in my telecom days. Excuse me, wireless telecom days…  I watched as she went from single mom one day to getting married within two months by morphing into a wholly different human being. At work she was tired, bitter, reeling with complaints but the moment she met her new beau every time she picked up his phone call it was like a goddamn spigot of molasses dripping from a tree. She was Puerto Rican but somehow she’d adopted a southern drawl. In other words her phone conversations and overall demeanor around him was dripping with gushing praise, giddiness, flattery and affection. She said she’ll do whatever it takes to get to the alter. 

Not that I was looking to run towards the alter. Nor did or was I ever going to act like Smiling Banshee Barbie but that next day at 2pm at the front counter of my London Cup & Coming shop Matthew proposed. I was shocked. He had planned this in advance as flowers began arriving and a group of singers entered performing our favorite song. There were no objections, yesterday was in the past. We were getting married. 





**Tears for Fears** 

It sounded like marbles dropping or maybe rain drops hitting a tin roof, but I wasn’t outside. What I was, was freezing. Frozen solid I guess. And then I saw him, he was crying hard. Not like alter hard, his eyes were the same as that day but this was different. It was an ugly cry. As he hovered over me. Well kinda. He sort of moved off over to the corner of the room with his mouth wide and his phone to his ear. 

“Babe, what is it? What is the matter? Can you, can you hear me? Wait, why can’t I hear you? Are you talking out loud?” He didn’t respond. Oh, maybe he’s whispering. Looks like quite the hysterical whisper. Oh he’s moving toward me again. 

“Babe I need a blanket.” 

Still nothing from him. Why do I feel— wait, I actually don’t feel anything. Like nothing, period. A weightlessness and I— I can’t move. “Matthew! Matthew, can you hear me?”  

I think he does but then he slides his hand over my eyes and closes them. I actually am trying but I can’t for the life of me open them back. “Matthew!” 



**\*\*\***



**Volley**

You see the caveat of “on paper” is that It really depends on what, which and whose paper you’re looking at. We’d been married a solid two years. Moved into a house I was previously using as a rental property. It was big enough to combine our lives without us needing to do the whole realty game. We honestly didn’t have the time to invest. This was a simpler solution. I put his name on the deed. 

The boys were doing great about to head off to college. A very exciting time in their lives. But Matthew began to balk at their school choices. I was noticing it sent him into a panic anytime they discussed either leaving town or the IVYs. 

“Who is going to pay for that?”  

“You are Dad.” 

He’d leave them alone after a shouting match.  Since we got married the family assistant transitioned from the boys over to our full time house manager. I was paying her directly now as she did a lot to help me out more than anything. 

By that time his London location was up and running but they hadn’t earned a star or an award. And the money was draining away. One night I got in bed and checked my emails, “Oh, Sweets TV wants me to host a baking war series on Fox.  I guess that’s sweet, ha.”

Matthew perked up. “You’re going to take it, right?” 

“No. Why would I do that?” 

“For the money hon.”  

“Matthew, that was a once in my lifetime thing. I have no desire to return to those hot lights and poorly paid assistants while the network makes millions.”  

“But what else are you doing with your time?” 



It was a slight. One of, I’d lost count. 

My shops were doing great and I was in the process of launching a franchising model. I was eight months or so into that and things were gliding along. Perhaps to him, in busy kitchens, managing fleeing staff, and waiting for the wrong customer to launch their precious Google Maps Local-ass Guide tirade, perhaps he was a bit overwhelmed. And I do know that money was not coming in like it did for him pre-pandemic. Two of his locations gave-in to the delivery app gods which turned out to equal bleeding even more cash. He refused to add delivery to one location. Which was smart but customers were still leery to go out and be amongst crowds, at least the ones that would dine at his upper-tier establishment. Think the matinee set. 

Had we been dating I can say I’d have left him four to six slights ago. But the thing of it is we were married. My very first time. It was public and not simply between us. That’s what I told myself. And that deep down we did love each other and we had happy times. On paper. If the paper you were looking at was the Meta Instagram Times. “You’ll see,” was my only response before kissing him on the cheek and turning off the lights. 



**CURTAINS**

Hot lights, again. There they were beaming down on me. I held my hands in the air and tears streamed down my face. I knew something had changed in an eternal capacity. And then came the darkness. There are specific times when darkness can be loud.  I turned and walked towards the sliver of light and it was over. 



\*\*\*



Before “wireless” telecom VP titles. Before joining the cupcake czars of America, I was a little girl with the giant ability to carry a tune. 

Some parents harp on any spec of talent their kid can display. 

“Oh my God, look honey, Jennifer made the most glorious *part in her hair today,* quick sign her up for Barbizon!” 

“No Claire you mean Sassoon.” 

I think Claire needs to question her marriage. But I also think, hmm did Barbizon name itself after Barbie or vice versa.  

“Joey, don’t spit on your grandmother!” 

“Shit, Lucy, we should sign him up for baseball.” 

I would sing in the shower, on every single car ride, through the aisles of the grocery stores from sitting inside the cart to walking alongside it as a teen and never not once did my parents even figure out if my middle school had a goddam chorus. When I got to high school they pushed me to join the finance team of all things. Welp, some dreams just remain repressed. 

My best friend Jackie would always invite me across the bridge to either shop or eat or finally, “let’s go to a show.” No matinees for me please. I’m not there yet. So as a wedding gift she got us tickets to Wicked. The Wizard of Oz and Annie were two of my favorite childhood things but some joys get repressed in adulthood when sales pitches need to be pitched and clients need to be wooed constantly. Robbielow was about the only thing that gave me childhood nostalgia and he was rather new in my life. Anyway, sitting there in those seats, taking in the spectacle something shook inside me.  I was under the wrong hot lights. 

I was under the wrong hot lights. 

My mind raced throughout the show. *How can I? Can I? What do I do, start a new TikTok? I can’t simply take Cup & Coming and start belting out a theme song on the channel? Could I?* No. I needed to find what my Wicked was, and I kinda needed to keep it to myself for a little bit. 

Shy, me? No. I’m not shy, but remember, I wasn’t just representing me anymore, I was representing us.  Eye Roll…

\*\*\*

There’s this thing, in theater there’s a thing. It’s really just a first rehearsal with the cast and the orchestra but the technical term for it is a sitzprobe. There’s a technical term. In all my years of life I don’t think I’ve ever had a geek-out moment, and I’m sorry if that is now a politically incorrect term but I geeked the fuck out. Not only had I found a way… I was able to come clean after getting cast, but now, I had a brand new group of friends who loved being themselves belting without barriers. I’d discovered a new talent. I could act as well as sing! And for the very first time, well besides actual middle school chorus, I was singing live with a band. An orchestra. A fucking group of people bleeding their hearts onto their instruments. There’s a rush only a sitzprobe can provide and to those of you in the world who will never ever experience it, I am truly and deeply sorry. 

So here I was in my off off off off Broadway, community theater debut, with my new best friends, under these glorious hot lights, taking our final bow. I had friends family and TikTok fans coming to multiple shows and I was beyond happy. I found my Wicked. I could not have asked for more. 

When we got to the restaurant for the wrap party Matthew held me tight. He was happy for me. So were the boys.  They had, in a short time, become my own children and proud of their “mother” was part of the bond that I could not have imagined. It really brought tears to my eyes  their hugs and praise.  

Dinner went well, all the cast and crew just reminiscing on the process from audition to final curtain. Our director, Craig, cried A LOT.  Something about ending a show I guess feels really final. But most times people pick up and do it all over again so I’m not sure why they get that emotional. I’m lying, I am very sure.

During dinner I got a text. There were a lot of high-level people that came out to the show, and well, being a viral pandemic TikTok’r didn’t hurt. But I could never have imagined this text. They wanted me! No, not Sweets TV. Not even the Food Network,  hey Bobby… 

They wanted me to guest star for one night only in, wait for it… Cinderell- - No, no you fool, WICKED! I nearly hit the ceiling. Matthew thought a rat had crossed my feet. I fell to the ground, Jackie came running over. I shoved the phone in her face. This was only the beginning.



\*\*\*



We got home very late. The boys went home with their best friend they’d invited to the show. I was heavily intoxicated but not enough to not finally declare it. I’d already made up my mind a few weeks beforehand and even found the perfect space. I didn’t need Broadway long-term but who knows what the future holds. 



Matthew came down to the kitchen and found me at the sink downing a glass of water. 

“We should go to bed.” 

“You should go to bed.” I joked. 

He came over and gave me a squeeze. 

“I’m so proud of you babe, and you’re going to be fantastic in Wicked.” 

“Thank you. I love you.” 

“I’ll be glad when you’re done so things can calm down and get back to normal around here.”



I sobered in the slightest. It was a slight. 



“Oh, well my love, I was waiting to tell you, things aren’t really going to be calm any time soon. I bought a building downtown and I’m registering the paperwork to start my own theater company. Ta-da.” 

I did a slow clap and sped it up looking for him to join in. 



**\*\*\***

**Fears for Tears**

I kept trying to open my eyes. Kept trying to feel anything but stiff. I kept trying to make out the sounds, maybe words being spoken around me. But every attempt proved impossible. Except maybe, there was the one drawn out sound and it was very close, like on top of me. It lasted a few seconds but it was distinct and then the darkness outside of my eyes became solid black. Was I enclosed now? Was that sound some sort of,  zipper? What the fk is happening to me? 



\*\*\*

Recovered Audio Log — Groom Lake Facility
Date: [GetDate]
Source: Recon Elements — Echo Company, 1st Expeditionary Division
Commanding Officer: Captain Richard Haines
Location: Nevada, 83 Miles N. of Las Vegas

[BEGIN AUDIO TRANSCRIPT]

Haines: “Alright, Echo One to Command—visual on Groom Lake proper. No movement. Place looks like a grave.”

Operator: “Copy Echo One. Proceed with caution.”

The recon team breached the outer gates at 0400 hours after encountering a handful of scavenger drifters—tribal remnants from the desert, more scared than hostile. Once neutralized, the team advanced past the first perimeter. The hangars were sealed, yet every light still burned. The desert wind howled through antenna arrays that still tracked … something.

Inside, the upper levels were pristine—desks covered in dust, coffee mugs half-full of something fossilized. No signs of looting. Only corpses—long dead, but undisturbed—as though the occupants simply stopped.

Beyond the primary blast doors, things changed. The walls grew thicker, the signage older: “PROJECT BLACK KNIFE.” “BRODMANN.” “APOLLYON.”
Each hallway hummed faintly with power. It wasn’t until the elevator shaft that the real discovery began.

The lift was non-functional; its cable snapped decades ago. The team rappelled into the dark—dust choking, air heavy with ozone—and emerged in a level still lit. Consoles blinked as though someone had just stepped out for lunch. Only the skeletons said otherwise.

Then came the anomaly: a chamber cut directly into the bedrock, lined with steel veins and conduits converging on a sealed bulkhead labeled simply—

PROJECT NIGHTFALL.

The room beyond housed a cryogenic array the size of a small hangar. Rows of pods—thirty, maybe forty—each containing… something. Something not human. The shapes were wrong—limbs too long, skulls elongated like glass vases filled with shadow. One of the pods was broken, empty.

The entire wing thrummed with low-frequency pulses, rhythmic—almost like a heartbeat. At its center stood a monolithic structure of black stone—smooth, geometric, shimmering under the fluorescents. The technicians dubbed it “the Obelisk.”

Haines: “Control, we’ve found … hell, I don’t even know what. We’re sending video feed now.”

Control: “Feed received. Wait—those readings—”

Static.

The recording ends with a final line, distorted but clear:
“… Something’s moving inside the ice.”

[END TRANSCRIPT]

Post-Report Summary:

Weeks after the expedition’s signal ceased, long-range sensors detected a faint power surge beneath Groom Lake. Whether the recon team ever made it out remains unknown. What is certain, however, is that the Nightfall Facility has awakened for the first time since 2076 — and something is still alive down there.```",1,1762303624.0,OWBEnclave,0,1.0,False

I was ~~perched with poise at a chic café in the UWS~~ stuck at my WFH desk with gr\*ss black coffee from the communal pot catching up with a friend who dropped the bombshell that is the ‘hemline theory’.

*Record scratch*. What is THAT?

She explained:

>**Skirts are shorter in good economic times and longer in poor economic times.**

Fascinating. Had never heard of such a thing. Naturally, my mind went straight to the [Mini Kellys](https://secondsense.co/listings/hermes-kelly-sellier-top-handle-orange-20-25554b8d) and [Balenciaga Bel Airs](https://secondsense.co/listings/balenciaga-bel-air-tote-black-medium-8b1ef7e8) of the world (both on my current wishlist btw if anyone is asking).

I want to go on record saying that I find the tension between small vs. big bags to be healthy for the community. The ecosystem needs both micro baguettes and firetruck-sized totes.

But I couldn’t stop wondering: does the hemline theory hold in handbags?

>**Hypothesis: handbags get smaller in good economic times and larger in worse economic times.**

If you’re curious, the 👗 hemline theory 👗 [isn’t a serious indicator](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-hemline-index-and-it-accurate-recession-indicator) (which you probably already guessed lol) BUUUUUT it’s a fun idea so why not explore?!?!

# i should’ve paid more attention in high-school econ

Pretending I read more than one Economist article per year, I said, “I can totally get to the bottom of this.”

1. I analyzed **133,523 sold listings** from The RealReal, Fashionphile, Rebag, Farfetch, MyGemma, and a few others.
2. For each month, I measured **what % of sold bags were large vs small** (ignoring the mediums). I chose volume share instead of tracking the actual resale prices because that would get messy fast due to brand mix, rarity, hype cycles, all the things. AKA what % of buyers chose big vs small bags each month. Think it’s cleaner/more intuitive/reflects actual buyer behavior rather than market noise.
3. Then I ran a couple of tests **comparing the share of large bags sold to U.S. unemployment**, which crept from 4.0% → 4.3% in 2025.

I took two approaches:

* Pearson correlation: the **“do they move together?” test**. It just checks if unemployment and large-bag share rise and fall in sync.
* OLS regression: the **“how much?” test**. It fits a line to quantify how much large-bag share changes when unemployment changes (and I even included a lag for the overachievers in the back) 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓

My old CS professor would be g l e a m i n g that I still have “regression” somewhere in my toolbox.

# reject the null hypothesis!!!! (…or whatever 💅)

These graphs show how the share of large bags being sold changed month-to-month alongside U.S. unemployment in 2025.

https://preview.redd.it/ve3uye8m4czf1.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5a6781a3c11837d38d535e6b02a5c4b122396ed

These top chart pairs the two lines: as unemployment creeps up (red), the share of large bags sold (blue) rises too like a visual “hemline effect” for handbags BUH DUH CHHHH

https://preview.redd.it/1gqdfgdn4czf1.png?width=1968&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c4bf69dfd85591df8757a5150d9fc9b431772a2

These four smaller charts break the data out by price tier so we’re comparing apples to apples on price. Large bags typically cost more because they’re um…. *literally* larger and use more material. So if we didn’t control for price, **we might accidentally interpret “people just spending more money” as “people choosing bigger bags.”** No bueno.

BASICALLY we can see how preferences change within each spending group, without the results getting muddied by the fact that big bags already cost more to begin with.

# quick stats chat

About p-values: it’s basically the chance that what you’re seeing is just random noise pretending to be a pattern. In this case, as unemployment moves up and down over these eight months, does large-bag share actually move with it or are we just chasing coincidence?

People way smarter than me usually look for p < 0.05, meaning there’s less than a 5% chance the result happened by luck. Note that correlation values range from –1 to +1 — the closer they are to +1, the more two things move together; the closer to –1, the more they move in opposite directions. 

So here’s the table. 

|tier|baseline|final|change|correlation|correlation p-value|ols regression p-value|

# what this tells us 👛👜👛👜👛

Nothing lol.

Look babes, you can find correlations between the number of times my aunt says “hella” and the number of times I think about ordering a Diet Coke but force myself to order water instead. Like what about ice cream sales and shark attacks? Or [Nicolas Cage movies and swimming pool drownings](https://allaboutwork.org/2014/05/27/spurious-correlations-or-why-nicolas-cage-must-be-stopped/)? Those are actual high correlations we see in the wild but like come on.

If we had to say something, it looks like the data hints that as unemployment ticks up, shoppers shift toward practical, bigger bags. It’s not a grand economic law, but if we were forced to make a call, **maybe the hemline theory might just extend to handbags, at least a little LOL**.

# yay data! im going to bed now

This is for funsies. It’d be super interesting to see what the data says back in 2021 when the economy was better and small bags were ALL THE RAGE, but I digress.

There are sooooooo many ways to measure the strength of the economy obvi (and even more interesting to me to think about strength and our perception of strength since those can differ!!!)

The fashion x data space excites me, gives me a giggle, and makes me stay up late writing python and thinking about hemline theory. So if you made it this far, thank you for reading and for humoring me.

* Ruby’s love for weapons makes its debuts

* Weiss makes her debut

* Ruby made her Crescent Rose
* Jaune considers his sword and shield to be a hand-me-down
* While Ruby considers it to be a family heirloom 
* That’s good character dialogue

* Apparently the explosion from earlier created a crater…
* See what I was talking about with the whole ambition falling short thing?
* I literally wouldn't have known this was supposed to be a big deal had it not been for this dialogue
* Rather than you know
* Seeing the explosion for myself
* I like all of the voice actresses and actors so far, they're all doing a good enough job

* And she considers herself the smartest
* A lot of the anime conventions and presentation this show tries to draw on, requires a certain amount of budget and finesse you can't cram in like this so it doesn't land
* But cute jokes like the pumpkin Pete’s marshmallow flakes rising up behind Pyrrha and falling swiftly work, because they're in the same medium of the show as itself 
* Pyrrha seems to like Jaune
* Emerald Forest debut 
* The goal is for each pair to pick a relic from the temple and guard/take it back
* The first step pt. 2 probably could've been more aptly named, landing, or the first steps, to denote that some progress has been made

* Everyone takes their pieces and tries to retreat from the monsters 
* For the record I am enjoying the team work and fight choreography it’s pretty good
* Also Nora’s fighting style is pretty cool
* They should've told a “may you”\* joke instead of the can I joke
* The Badge and the Burdens

* And she immediately shoves him to the ground 
* Cute enough scene
* The Stray
* Vale festival debut
* Weiss hates the White Fang
* Whereas Blake goes to bat for them
* “Those Faunus only know how to lie, cheat, and steal” Weiss that isn't even funny rich white girl racism

* Not to victim blame
* And most everyone is aware that a part of Trump’s plans for his residence involves a scheme that allows him to get even more blatantly violent and immoral than he already has with ICE
* So yeah, this did not age well, at all
* Penny knew from the start that Blake is a faunus
* “It sure is windy today” cute line
* “The innocent never run Yang”, man I'm glad Jew don't exist in this world, or other minorities or anything 
* The white fang \*were\* the culprits
* But they're working with your man from the first episode
* Sun debuts his weapon
* As does Penny
* Blake tries to tell Weiss everything
* Weiss doesn't care anymore though and doesn't want to know
* They should've had my man Johnny Yong Bosch voice Sun
* Final thoughts: Uhm show that is trying really hard to be charming and good
* I admire that a lot
* While it certainly is stealing from other things
* The Monty Oum weapons/fights
* The voice acting
* And fairly safe, but cohesive tone of the series gives it strong legs to stand on
* I sort of like the music too, though none of the songs play long enough tbh 
* The writing is simple, amateurish and simple, but not always bad
* The character designs get across, most of what they can 
* But the backgrounds and other attempts at strong presentation fall flat, likely due to the medium
* I'm not exactly compelled to watch more, but I had a little fun
* And I didn't get very mad or frustrated
* This was a mostly alright season
* Probably something around a 5-6/10",1,1762302883.0,CharacterRant,0,0.67,False
1oooiah,https://i.redd.it/l8r0lem53czf1.jpeg,(OC) Just a reminder there are amazing partners out there,"This might seem small to some, but it meant the world to me and I just wanted to share that there really are incredible people out there.

I lost my sweet Bernese Mountain Dog (who I had before meeting my husband) about a year and a half ago. Today would’ve been his 10th birthday, and it hit me harder than I expected. I didn’t realize just how deeply I was still connected to him until today.

This morning, I woke up to find a beautiful bouquet of flowers waiting for me next to my coffee. My husband had quietly taken care of all the work I had on my plate so I could grieve in my own way and on my own timeline. Then, to end the night, he made dinner and surprised me with a black and tan.

When we got married 4 years ago, we had three dogs and made three signature cocktails named after each of them. My Berner’s was a black and tan. It was such a thoughtful touch that it made me cry like a baby, but in the best way.

I just wanted to put it out there: there *are* wonderful, caring partners who truly show up for you in the ways that matter most.",40,1762302878.0,MadeMeSmile,6,0.95,False

\### Background

So this was my 4th marathon, the first being back during covid in 2021, which I didn't train properly for, was literally just running a couple times a week on top of playing soccer with a local team. Ran that in 3:47. After that, I just kept a routine of running maybe once a week and didn't think much of it. Not sure exactly what changed, but fast-forward to 2023, and I started taking running a bit more seriously—too seriously, too soon, in fact. I pretty much arbitrarily decided that I wanted to run a Sub-3 in 2024. Back then, I didn't know much about managing easy vs hard mileage or what sessions I should be doing. Every run was more or less me going out and running hard. On top of this, I was also still training 2-3 times a week with my soccer team. Unsurprisingly, this led to injury, and in November 2023 I got a stress fracture on my shin, which left me unable to run until February 2024, with my marathon scheduled for May that year. 



From what I remember, my training went pretty well after that, but I still didn't know much about proper training structures or what sessions I should be doing. I put aside the Sub-3 goal and just decided I run off-feel with a vague 3:20ish goal. Ended up running 3:16, which I was pretty happy with. After that, I decided to stop playing soccer as I wanted to focus more on my running, and I couldn't do both to the level I'd want without getting injured again. 



I gradually started to get more into running, especially later in 2024 when I entered the Milan Marathon 2025 with another Sub-3 target. This time however, I started learning about different marathon plans, the 80/20 rule, proper fueling strategies, etc. I had a good training block over the winter and spring and ended up running 2:57 in Milan in April. This only grew my motivation to improve even more, so when I got a Dublin marathon entry for October, I set my sights on a BQ time, which I knew would be around 2:50 for me (23M).



\### Training

For my 2:57 marathon in April, I had 4 peak weeks over 100k p/w, with the highest being 120k. I knew I wanted to top that this time. I basically just went straight back into training a couple weeks after Milan and started running >100k a week almost every week over the summer. By July, I was running 120k p/w. I had a hiccup in August when I suffered from another shin injury - actually on my other leg this time - which meant I was still able to run (albeit in some pain) but had to cut out all speedwork and only run easy for basically the whole month of August. I was still able to maintain the mileage thankfully (mostly, maybe down to 110k p/w). Once that was healed, I got a few great training weeks in Sep/Oct, including 4 concurrent weeks >125k with a peak of 130k.



A typical training week for me (midweek runs are all evenings after work):

Monday: Gym + cross-training. Strength training is actually something I'd like to improve on in future.

Tuesday: Easy run - Usually between 5:15-5:45 pace, depending on fatigue.

Wednesday: Threshold session - 5x2k/3x3k were my most common workouts. During my peak weeks, I also started to include a short run/bike/rower session at lunchtime.

Thursday - Easy run.

Friday - V02 Max / Track session - 4x4mins/5x1k were the usuals. Also started to work in some quick lunchtime sessions during my peak weeks here too.

Saturday: Easy run.

Sunday: Long run - I prefer easy pace with long MP/tempo blocks rather than steady long runs. E.g. 32k with 10k easy, 16k MP, 6k easy.



My mileage breakdown was usually around 75%ish easy and 25% hard. I don't follow any specific plan but I take some workouts I like from popular plans and do a lot of research on this reddit among other places into ideal marathon planning. I think I'll incorporate more double-days into my future training because running 130k p/w on singles meant that most runs were at least 17-18k, even with a MLR on Wednesdays and the LR on Sundays. My training highlights were a 35k LR (10k easy, 21.1k MP, 4k easy), I find this a great predictor session as a peak LR during peak week. I also did Yassoo 800s 3 weeks out with average 2:32 reps.



I know this isn't exactly advised during a marathon plan, but I also slowly cut weight over these few months from 71kg to 67kg. I really focus on good nutrition now and focus especially on eating high-protein for recovery and high-carb for fuel. During the buildup, I also ran 2 key tune-up races - a half-marathon 6 weeks out, where I ran 1:17:12, and a 10k 3 weeks out, where I ran 34:20. These were great confidence boosters in the lead-up to the big day.



\### Pre-race

Training felt good leading into the race, and I started tapering around 10 days out, but my last big session was the Sunday LR 14 days out. Did 65% peak week mileage 2 weeks out, followed by 50% on race week, including the race. I ate 10g of carbs per kg of bodyweight for the 3 days leading up to race-day and made sure to get extra sleep and to relax that week, also cut out caffeine. My main target was 2:45, but in the back of my mind I knew on a perfect day I could try for sub 2:40. I decided to go out at 2:41ish pace for the first half and see how I was feeling then.



On race morning, I ate my favourite pre-race meal: A coffee, a toasted bagel with a sliced banana with honey and jam inside, a small pot of porridge drizzled in honey, and an electrolyte sports drink, which I sipped on the whole morning before the start.



It was very cold and windy that morning. I think I was actually so focused on getting to use one of the portable toilets before the start that I neglected my warm-up a bit. 10 minutes before the start, I had an NRGY 45 caffeine gel and was ready to go. I was in wave 1, thankfully, so didn't have to wait too long to start.



\### Race

My legs felt pretty meh for the first few kilometres. Looking back now, I think it was because of the cold and my inadequate warm-up. My calves especially seemed to feel quite stiff, and I was nervous I'd be forced to slow down later on. After the first 10k though, they started to feel fine, and I was cruising in a small pack of runners, sheltering from the wind and just ticking down the miles. I took an NRGY 45 gel every 25-30 mins, which totaled 90g of carbs p/h. My second gel also had caffeine (took around 400mg that day total, including the morning coffee and pre-race gel).



The course had rolling hills and a lot of slight inclines, which made it tricky to pace, but I didn't focus too much on getting each km perfect for the first half and figured I'd just see where I was at halfway and decide from there. I passed halfway at 1:20:30 feeling good, and so decided I'd keep steady until 30k and then start to push if I could. Turns out I could! I started cutting down the km splits from 3:50s closer to 3:40s and actually enjoyed this part of the race a lot. I love negative splitting, and I felt strong every time I passed someone. It was a big mental battle to just run the kilometre I was in, and I had to dig deep, especially in the last 5k. I actually didn't know what time I was on for during this - I was still expecting a 2:40 or 2:41 finish. When I made it to the home straight, I saw the clock said 2:39 and I legged it as hard as I could, crossing the line in 2:39:36 and delighted with myself.



\### Post-race

Going into the race thinking a 2:40 would only be possible with ideal conditions and the perfect day, I was over the moon to have run it in challenging weather. My calves seized up as soon as I stopped, and I couldn't walk properly for two days after the race, but it was 100% worth it. I was able to get back running on Wednesday post-race, and as of writing this a week later, I'm already back to daily runs and am starting back some speedwork. 



I have no races planned as of yet, but I think I'll do another marathon next spring - was thinking of Barcelona maybe. I'll also find some shorter races to do in the next few months too. I get great motivation from good race results, so I'm looking forward to getting back into training to improve for next time. I know the marginal gains will become harder the faster I get, but let's see how the training goes! Hope my ramblings help anyone bothered enough to read all of this, thank you!!



TLDR: Ran \~120k p/w from May to October, 6 runs p/w with 3 easy and 3 workouts (1 threshold, 1 V02 Max, 1 LR with MP blocks. 75% easy mileage. 1 big and 1-2 small strength sessions + 2-3 short cross-training sessions p/w.

I kept having nightmares about Frank and his murder farm, something that caused me to wake up every three or so hours. The nightmares got so bad that I wound up just getting out of bed and heading to my computer chair, just to sit and think about things, about my life, about- *I have to piss,* I suddenly thought, looking over at the door. *But the door is locked.* I then got up, went over to the window, opened it, and relieved myself that way, peeing all over the rose garden that was on that side of the house. When I was done, I closed the window and sat back down at my desk, continuing to contemplate my life choices until six a.m., when the door was unlocked and my father came into the room, turning on the light, no questioning of whether or not he could come in or not this time. I guess supposed crack addicts don't get privacy. ""What are you doing up?"" He asked and then paused. I knew what was coming next. ""What did you smoke *this time*?""

""What do you want, dad?"" I asked, rubbing my eyes.

""It's Saturday."" My father said. ""Time for you to come to work with me- but it looks like your inebriated, so I don't want you on site today. That's a safety hazard. We'll start *tomorrow*, I suppose.""

""Yeah, tomorrow,"" I said. ""But, how do you expect me to do homework during the weekend-""

""Your mom contacted your teachers yesterday while I was making dinner and managed to work something out with them."" Was the interjection ""They're willing to give you an extra study hall to complete your assignments. You're *not* getting out of what your mother- what *I* want you to do."" *No, no, mister-man. What you said first was the right word choice. It's all what your crazy wife wants*, I thought. *The only decision you have ever made by yourself was when you chose to ground me. The rest is her.* ""Go back to sleep and wake up at 9:30 to take Jackie for a walk."" Jackie was our German Sheperd, and she was older than dirt. It took an hour just to get her from the house to the mailbox, and that was *with* help. ""At 11:00 you will start your homework. At 1:00 you will take Jackie out again, and then at 1:30 you will make lunch."" Giving me only a few minutes to take an elderly dog out for a walk was *impossible*, but my father didn't exactly care. Instead of looking at the situation and the time frames clearly, he just spouted off a long list of what he thought I needed to do during the day. Said list was laid out for what felt like an hour, and then he ended with, ""When I come home, you are expected to be in your room with the door shut. No noise, none of your constant murmuring, just *silence*. I will inspect your room for drugs at 5:00. Is that understood?""

""Yes,"" I said quietly.

""*What*?"" My father asked, his voice thick with anger and, from what I understood, militant order that wasn't normal for him. He was usually a calm and agreeable person, but ever since he 'found out' that I was 'doing drugs', my father had become that Gunny from *Full Metal Jacket*. ""You're *mumbling*.""

""*Yes*,"" I repeated loudly. My father gave me a cold look and then left the room, slamming the door behind him like he did the previous night. ""Christ *almighty*..."" After the shit show which labeled itself as a father-son talk happened, I didn't even move from my chair. I just sat there and stared off into space, unsure of whether or not I should check if the door was still unlocked, toying around with the uncertainty until I gathered up the courage to get up. I crept up to the door, touched the knob, and tried to turn it. And it *did*. He forgot to lock the door behind him and I was going to use that as the first step of my plan. After all, I did have to act fast or I was going to get wiped off the face of the earth. *Step one,* I thought, slowly easing myself into the hallway. *Get out of my room and look around for clues while mom is still asleep-* my head turned to the right, and I saw the weirdest behavior I've ever seen come from my mother. She was sitting on the couch in the dark living room, just in her robe, and was completely still. A muffled gurgling noise was coming from near where the coffee table was, a muffled gurgling that sounded like someone was choking on their own blood while having something in their mouth. I slowly walked towards the living room, covering my mouth to stifle my heavy breathing, and crouched down, hugging the wall that was opposite of my room, my gaze locked on my mother, who stood up and bent down. When she came back up, her body turned so her back was towards the backdoor, and in her hands were my father's arms. She then began to walk backwards, her movements heavy and slowed due to dragging a person who was far larger than herself, and when she cleared the couch, I got a good view of my father. A kitchen knife had been lodged into his jugular, and blood was spewing out everywhere. The right side of his head was severely bloodied and his eye was bulging out from the socket. His arms, along with his torso, were covered in vertical gashes. A few black socks from the laundry basket that sat on the recliner had been knotted in the center and placed into his mouth, the end bits wrapped around his head like a ball gag.

I was witnessing the disposal of a murder victim in real time.

And it made me puke in my mouth.

I swallowed my vomit and kept watching as my mother dragged my father's body through the living room, into the kitchen, and out the back door. When she was out of sight, I scurried back to my room and wrote down everything that I saw in one of my notebooks, stopping to gag every few minutes or so. When everything was recorded, I shoved the book into my school bag and booted up my computer in an attempt to contact anyone that could help, only to find that the internet had been shut off. *Crafty bitch,* I thought, putting my head in my hands. *I bet she cut off our phone service too.* My legs then decided to work on their own and caused me to shoot up out of my chair, and I left the room again, this time heading to my parents' room. When I opened the door, I found that the whole thing was completely trashed, and the walls were covered in writing that had been written in a red sharpie marker. *Fitting for the occasion,* I thought, going into the room to look at my mother's beautiful artwork, which said, '**PIG FACED DICK', 'SLUT',** and **'DIRTY MOTHER-FUCKER'** over and over and over again in large lettering. The part that bothered me about it was that the writing was poorly done, as if a kindergartener with a potty-mouth had drawn all over the walls.

At this point, any normal person in any normal situation would have called the cops, but I was neither a normal person nor in a normal situation. So, I wound up just backing out of the room and hugging the wall again, inching myself towards the entrance to the living room. I heard the back door open and I crouched down, listening to the sound of my mother's footsteps as she came through the kitchen and back into the living room. I did a quick peek and saw that she was now wearing muck boots that were coated in blood, and she sat down on the couch to take them off. Take them off and throw them at the TV, to be exact, and after the first one cracked the screen, the second one completely obliterated it and knocked the whole thing down onto the floor. My mother then stood up and turned to face the hallway. Blood was all over the front of her robe and around her mouth.

1ooo8ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1ooo8ph/review_amanoi/,Review - Amanoi,"This is our 2nd amanoi stay, both times we did the wellness package. Was 3 hours massage last year but was reduced to 90 minutes now. Full board + 1 activites to choose from a list + Cham Blessing. First visit was impressive, 2nd stay was even more jaw dropping. They just keep on improving when I thought they are already prefect.

The Ride to Amanoi

Our previous stay was in rainy season so there was not much to see, but this time around the weather really cooperated and we can see the true beauty of nature.

[Some of the view on the way to Amanoi](https://preview.redd.it/wcvgt923xbzf1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c030e20f6d7cd38542ceeeb5aa9598607008e95a)

The Room  
They upgraded and did a refresh on the Banya house, and we are VERY honored to be the first guests to test and see it ourselves. Sorry for the quality as this is a screenshot from a video from our first visit.

[Before](https://preview.redd.it/byfdj7lexbzf1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bba7b9c2665f4e995625acbbf73f62ec1e3fe0c5)

[After](https://preview.redd.it/oq9u3s4lxbzf1.jpg?width=2880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=707411b4188504ef794c2e855a595f66c09dcdf3)

This is a GREAT quality of life update, as before during the banya treament 2 people would squeeze into that one big platform and getting in and out is kinda hard. After the update as you can see, 2 fully seperate treatment bed with bean bag mattress.

On top of the redo on the sauna room, they refreshed all the wood flooring/trims/exterior walls. So instead of greyish looking, now it is the fresh natural wood tone like the ones you see in the Sauna room (the treatment beds). Wish I have a picture but we did not take any pictures of that.

The Food

This is the area that most people complained about, but to us the food was already pretty good for a resort. But this time, they improved by A LOT as they did changed the executive chef. The whole menu got a overhual for the better and we did try to order the pomelo salad which was no longer on the menu. Somehow they can still recreate it and it is just as good. The portion size also got a lot bigger, even though we have the full board. We did check the price on the menu and it is very fair for what you get. The Grilled baby scallops are a MUST try.

Activities

We did the guided snorkeling, guided Goga Peak Trek and the food tour at Phang Rang.

Snorkeling  
This is my first time snorkeling I am short sighted and couldnt fit my glasses within the goggle. They do offer a short sighted goggles but it won't be the clearest. If you are short sighted please keep that in mind. With that being said I was still able to see most of the coral/fishes/sea urchins/star fish. The guide was super knowledgable and would dive and pick up some star fish/sea urchins for me to see and feel. Also saw crabs and goats along the coast, which is also amazing

Goga Peak  
Really recommand people to do this, you can truly see how massive amanoi is from far and it is only around 15 to 20 minutes each way. Even though it was a bit cloudy when we did it, it was still very impressive.

Food Tour  
Different guide will goto different restaurnats/path. Our guide's name was Loan, we went to 5 different spots. I did not take a picture for one of them as it is pho but the broth is more vegtable/Celery heavy.

Spa  
Never did a treatment at the spa house as we do have our private treatment room. All I can say is we both fell asleep at every treatment. This time we had amanoi massage, groudning massage, Banya treatment, indian head massage. It was all truly amazing especially the banya treatment. It almost feels like a theatrical expereince as you first started off with sauna for around 10 minutes. Rest a bit, then you go back to the sauna but this time you lie down on the treatment bed and they would smack you with the eucalyptus leaf, after a few minutes you rest. And you repeat this iirc 3 times, but each time the temptaure is getting hotter and hotter. Each mini section when you feel like its unbareable the treatment will just maigcally finish and its time to rest. Then its followed by cold plunge and relaxing inside the pool, where 2 staff will hold you up, and you can fully relax body almost like you are in a floating pod. You also get a scrub with coffee and some other mixtures in the sauna room (this time around they will open the door, so its not as inetnse as before). After the scrub it is followed by some bamboo smacking in the treatment room. 

Overall  
Do keep in mind amanoi is in the national park there will be bugs/insects around no matter how much they treat/care for it. I have seen wild cats there as well. But I have never seen any bugs inside the room! They truly makes you feel like home away from home. Service is ALWAYS perfect. Its is also very important to say that they are truly connected to the local culture. 

Amanoi will always have a special place in my heart and would 100% recommand anyone want a taste of what Aman is all about.

1ooo7ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Untappd/comments/1ooo7ev/surprised_about_the_recent_changes/,Surprised about the recent changes,"I've had over a week to reflect on the recent changes within Untappd. I'd like to share these thoughts with you and will also send feedback to Untappd HQ.

There are quite a few things that surprise me about Untappd's recent policy change.

First, the thing that users are rightly most annoyed about may not apply at all. Nowhere in the new ""Drink Guidelines"" does it state that ""Soda,"" ""Coffee,"" and ""Tea"" are supported beverages. So either the ""Drink Guidelines"" are incorrect, or these types of beverages are now incorrectly listed in Untappd.

[https://help.untappd.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034018052-Drink-Guidelines](https://help.untappd.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034018052-Drink-Guidelines)

Furthermore, these ""Drink Guidelines"" raise so many questions that I'll save them for another time. I'd love to hear from someone who knows exactly what's allowed and what's not on Untappd.

Secondly, I'm surprised that some people claim they don't notice anything significant. In my view, they're mistaken in not considering that, just because they don't notice a difference, doesn't mean there really isn’t one.

Third, there are indeed noticeable differences. However, everything depends on how and for what you use Untappd. If you only use it as a sort of logbook to track your “drinks”, there might not be much difference. If you use it to search for places to drink, then something will definitely change. That seems to me to be the whole point of this whole situation, to attract new Verified Venues.

But if you're not a standard user by Untappd's standards, a lot more does change.

Statistics and numbers are very important to me. I don't just drink because beer can be tasty, but also to collect and review special titles, rare beer styles in particular. If this doesn't apply to you, please don't read any further, because there's no need to bother me.

Out of nowhere, I suddenly have 10x ""Non-Alcoholic - Malt Soda,"" 6x ""Non-Alcoholic - Malta,"" and 1x ""RTD - Hard Ice Tea"" in my history. 

That brings me to the fourth point.   
The now so called “Malt Sodas” were previously deleted, if they were not brewed by a brewery, because someone felt this was correct according to the then-current rules. But what are the rules now? Barbican\* is now a Malt Soda because it wasn't allowed to be a brewery product, but that apparently no longer matters? Will all the deleted titles of this category be reinstated?

Will these types of drinks, which were previously considered “beer”, because they were brewed by a company that was considered a brewery, also all be classified as Malt Soda (like Fayrouz from Egypt for example) or will they remain “beer”?

At this point, the 269 Legacy styles will immediately clash with the newly introduced styles.

The same goes for ""Malta”, they're now being moved from the ""Malt Beer"" category to ""Non-Alcoholic Malta."" And here, too, there's a clash between the old and new styles.

And if I apparently drank a Hard Ice Tea that was categorized as ""Hard Seltzer"" but wasn't deleted, because it was not a “Hard Seltzer”(?) I've apparently suddenly drunk an ""RTD"" now. 

Furthermore, I foresee problems with the ""Flavored Malt Beverage"" style, where I've also seen titles wrongly(?) moved to the RTD categories. And what about “Root Beer”, what is the current status of that style?

Fifth, I'm surprised that no one at Untappd seems to have thought about this. The new styles seem to have been thrown in without any deeper thought. And that moderation is apparently already underway, even though it seems rather early for that, because...

Sixth, and this is perhaps my biggest surprise, there's been absolutely no further communication from Untappd HQ about all this. All I'm reading here is that moderators are also completely unaware of this, but like I said they are moderating on the new styles anyway, or am I wrong about that?

You'd think this would all be highly undesirable.

\*Aujan Industries is even listed twice as a ""brand"" on Untappd now. One entry is hidden, but has drink entries that were deleted before, the other entry is visible. Why oh why?",4,1762302092.0,Untappd,2,0.83,False
1ooo77j,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ooo77j/perelli_and_kravitz/,Perelli and Kravitz.,"I did not think I would like a dental office. The phones rang in a rhythm that never changed. People asked about insurance and billing codes I did not understand. The air smelled of fluoride and something sweet that reminded me of classrooms. I was a temp. I kept my coat on the back of my chair, my purse zipped, and my face arranged in that attentive shape that passes for confidence. It was not a great job, but I had worked worse. A warehouse where you never saw the sun. A receptionist job where the owner yelled. A medical office where the doctor called the girls sweetheart and never learned our names. Compared to that, this was a clean office with a window and a coffee pot that didn’t smell burnt. Two dentists brought in lunch once a week. That felt rare, like a small gift. It was easy to be grateful.

I got there before eight most mornings. The building sat in a strip between a lawn service and a liquor store. The sign out front said Perelli and Kravitz, Family Dentistry, with a cartoon tooth that looked more like a ghost. I unlocked the door with the key the agency gave me and let the lights lift the shadows out of the waiting room. The plants by the window were fake, but someone dusted them. I straightened the magazines. I liked that part, the quick order. People around me seemed to accept that things could be steady. I wanted that to rub off.

Marla had gone out on maternity leave, which is how I got the assignment. I was taking her place at the desk and in the back room where we kept paper files for the older patients who never wanted to log in to anything. I liked writing names on file tabs. It felt like binding things together.

Mitch was Dr. Perelli on the website and on the plaque on the door, but he told me on the second day to call him Mitch. He said it like he wanted everyone to be comfortable around him. He was handsome in the way that photographs sometimes are when they’re lit right. Nice teeth, of course. Dark hair that made him look younger than he was. He wore fitted shirts and had a tan in winter. He came up to the front a lot. Sometimes he would lean his elbows on the counter and talk like he was listening to every word. He laughed in a way that looked like he had decided to be charming and then followed through.

During the first week he stood at the counter and asked if I had ever considered whitening. He said it so casually I felt like I should have been thinking about it already. He said he would do it for free if I wanted, an employee perk, and winked. I smiled and said I would think about it. He leaned a little closer, not enough to make a scene, just enough to be noticed. It made my chest warm and my ears hot. I watched my reflection in the glass door after he walked away, like a teenager. I do not like that about myself, how quickly I can become someone who watches herself watching herself.

I learned the script on the phones and the names of the hygienists and how to coax the schedule into a shape that didn’t make anyone hate me. I practiced the right mix of apology and firmness when people asked for the last appointment of the day. I got good at the software. I laughed when people told me stories about their dogs or their grandchildren. I liked the way older women sometimes took my hand when I passed them their insurance cards, like we shared a secret about time.

By the end of the second week I was keeping my lunch in the staff fridge and leaving a sweater on the back of my chair. I stopped taking my purse to the bathroom. That is always the sign for me, when I stop carrying everything with me. It means I want to stay.

There was a day the dentists brought in subs and chips and cookies. Thom, who was Dr. Kravitz but always Thom in conversation, was quiet and kind. He remembered my name and asked me about my bus route. He had a wife who worked at the community college. He told me that as if it were the most normal thing in the world, which it is. He ate half a cookie and left the rest on a napkin. Mitch put his hand on my shoulder when he came up behind me to get more mustard. It sat there a beat too long. He took it away and smiled like he had not done anything unusual. My skin stayed aware of it for an hour.

He started coming up more often. He called my name when there was no one else around. He asked where I had worked before and told me office horror stories of his own. He said I kept things running smooth. He made me feel chosen in a small way. I know the difference between being seen and being looked at. I did not pretend I could not tell. I let it happen. I liked the idea that I could be the kind of woman who gets the better job and keeps it. Who is wanted in small rooms.

We went to the Homewood Suites on a Thursday after work. I was the one who suggested we wait until the office was fully empty. I felt stupid for being careful and I felt proud for being careful. He drove a gray SUV that still had the sticker in the window from the dealership. He kept his hand on the gear shift and looked at me at every red light like we had agreed to something. The lobby of the hotel had a bowl of green apples and a flat fireplace. The room had that bland smell of clean linens and old air. I watched myself in the bathroom mirror for a moment before I came out, like I wanted to see who I had decided to be. He said he had not done this before, which is the kind of lie people treat like politeness. I nodded like I had not heard the lie. I made myself small and open and grateful. That part is hard to admit.

He told me later to keep it quiet. He said the office was a small place and people talk. He said he did not want the drama. He said it like he was protecting me too. He said my contract with the temp agency could get messy. I nodded. I understood rules. I wrote his name on a Post-it one afternoon when the phones went quiet. I pressed my pen hard so the ink bled a little. I felt dumb and light. I folded the paper small and put it in the pocket of my cardigan. At lunch I took it out and smoothed it flat and then threw it away. I have done that kind of thing since middle school. There is something about writing a name that asks the world to notice you.

A week after that we went back to the hotel. He had a way of moving that made decisions for both of us. He laughed a lot and tipped the housekeeper too much when we passed her cart in the hallway. On the drive back he talked about a car he wanted. Something with a soft leather interior, something you could smell. I had the picture in my head, the two of us in that car, me with white teeth and a new dress, him tapping the steering wheel with a satisfied look. It is not that I believed it, not exactly. It is more that I enjoyed the thinking. It was winter and the days were gray and the office light was green and humming. It felt like a secret place inside the other place.

A few weeks later I counted the days and then counted them again. I tried not to buy a test. I made myself wait. I told myself there were other reasons for a late period. I bought the test after work and used it in the restroom at the drugstore, like I had done before. I stood in a stall with the test in my hand and the fan rattling above me. I felt like I was in a story I had already read. The line was there. It was not faint. It was an answer that did not leave room for maybes.

I told him in the hallway near the sterilizer, which is not where you tell someone that kind of thing, but there are not many places in a dental office that are private. He looked past me and then at me as if he had to check who I was. He said my name the way people do on the phone when they need to buy themselves a second. His face went blank and then careful. He said we should talk after work. He said we would figure it out. His voice had that calm tone doctors use when they tell people a plan. He patted my arm once and went back to a patient.

I put my hands on the counter until my fingers stopped shaking. The phones kept ringing. People still wanted to know if their insurance covered crowns and what time the hygienist had open next week. I answered. I kept my voice even. The muscles in my face knew the shape. I have that skill. I am steady on the surface. Underneath is a different story. I told myself over and over that the underneath was not for work hours.

He did not talk to me after work. He said he had to run. He said the roads were getting bad. He texted me later that night, a short message that said we would talk tomorrow. The next day he kept moving. He was busy. He put a hand on my shoulder once and then took it away like the touch burned. I was angry and then I was embarrassed for being angry in front of myself. I decided to give him until Friday. I do not know why I made a little deadline like that. It was something I could hold.

Friday afternoon the light in the waiting room turned that yellow color it gets when the sun comes low and the blinds cut it into stripes. I had just put away the clipboard we use for new patients when Thom came to the front. He had that polite face administrators have when there is paperwork. He said my name. He said they appreciated everything I had done. He said Marla was coming back on Monday and that meant they would not need me. He said if there was another leave in the future they would be happy to have me back. He smiled in that kind way and held out an envelope.

I took it and nodded and said the words I know how to say. Thank you for the opportunity. I enjoyed working here. I appreciate the experience. It felt like I was reading off a card. I asked where Mitch was so I could say goodbye. Thom hesitated and then smiled in a different way, like he had decided on the most decent version of the truth. He said Mitch and his wife had left for a long weekend in Colorado to go skiing. He said Mitch was sorry he could not say goodbye in person. He said things like that happen, you know how it is.

I felt something in my throat like a cough I could not swallow. I wanted to ask questions that would make me look foolish. Did Mitch tell you to do this. Did you know. Did anyone know. I did not ask. Thom put a hand on the counter and said he had put a little extra in the paycheck to say thanks. He said he meant it. In that second I believed him. His eyes were steady. He did not know the rest. Or maybe he did and was doing what he could. It is possible to be kind and complicit at the same time. That is a lesson I keep learning.

I cleaned out my drawer. A sweater, a half-used chapstick, a pen I liked, and a pack of gum with two pieces left. I threw away the gum and put the pen in my bag. I took one more look at the waiting room. The plants by the window still looked dusty. The magazines were straight. I washed my coffee cup and left it on the rack to dry because I did not want to take their mug with me. I left my key with a sticky note and sat for a minute in my chair. I looked at the phone and felt a strange affection for it, like it was a pet I was saying goodbye to. It is odd what you choose to miss.

On the bus home the envelope felt heavy in my purse. I did not open it. I watched the city in the window and thought about colors. The gray of slush at the edges of the road. The red of brake lights in a long line. The blue on a sign for a gym I used to go to. I pressed my palm flat against my stomach without thinking. I took it away and put both hands on my knees. I watched a woman with a baby on her chest pull down the edge of a tiny hat with rabbits on it. I wanted to smile at her but I did not trust my mouth. I kept my face steady.

At home I put the envelope on the kitchen table. The apartment was quiet in the way apartments are in the late afternoon on a weekday, when everyone else is somewhere else. I turned on the light over the sink and the bulb hummed. I made tea and did not drink it. I opened the envelope and took out the check. There was a bonus. It was not much, but it was more than I expected. There was a note from Thom that said thanks again, and that was all. No signature from Mitch. No message. The absence sat there like it had weight.

I took the test out of the bathroom trash and looked at it again, as if it might have changed. It looked back at me with the same answer. I wrapped it in toilet paper and put it back in the trash. I thought about the stories women tell about decisions and timelines and clinics and small rooms with posters on the wall. I thought about work schedules and bus routes and money. I thought about calling my sister and then did not. I thought about telling no one. I thought about a future that did not include a dental office or a car with soft leather or the feeling of being chosen in a hallway.

That night I slept badly and woke early. The quiet before the city gets loud is thin and breathy. I watched the gray light come up and tried not to name what I was feeling. Naming things can make them too solid. I lay there and let it pass through me. I remembered the way Mitch had leaned over the counter that first week and the way he said my name like it was something he had plans for. I remembered Thom’s careful eyes. I remembered the bowl of green apples at the hotel and how polished they looked and how mealy they tasted when I bit one. That detail made me smile in a small, tired way. The body keeps odd records.

In the morning I put on coffee and sat at the table with a notebook. I wrote down the numbers I needed to call. I wrote a list of temp agencies I had not tried yet, and the address of the health clinic on 4th Street, and a reminder to ask my landlord about the leaky bathroom faucet, and a note to study the city bus routes I would have to adjust if I started somewhere new. I wrote slowly. The act of writing steadied me. When I reached for a pen, a folded square of paper slid out of my cardigan pocket and fell to the floor. I picked it up and opened it. It was the Post-it with his name. I had forgotten I had not thrown that one out. I looked at the letters made in my own hand. I pressed my thumb into the paper until the ink bled a little. Then I tore it into small pieces, not carefully, not dramatically, just until it was no longer legible, and I pushed the pieces into the bottom of the trash with the heel of my hand.

I washed my cup. I combed my hair. I put on my coat. The city outside was the same as it had been yesterday, which felt rude and also helpful. I locked my door and stood in the hallway for a second, listening to a neighbor’s radio through the thin wall. A talk show, something about taxes. Ordinary life making its noise. I went down the stairs and out into it. I held my head steady. I put one foot in front of the other. I did the next thing. I have learned that this is a kind of faith. Not the big kind, just the small kind you need to keep breathing. I stepped into the day and let it take me.",1,1762302079.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Or avoiding them altogether. It feels like nobody knows how to talk to each other anymore without spiraling into self-doubt. Social anxiety has become so normalized that awkwardness is now a meme. And the advice out there? Mostly noise from unqualified influencers preaching exposure therapy like it's a fitness challenge.

This post is different. Everything here comes from deep research, psychology books, podcasts with real experts, and even some low-key neuroscience. The goal is to help anyone who’s tired of overthinking every casual chat and wants to take control. It’s not your fault your brain panics during small talk. But yeah, you can retrain it—and fast.

Here’s what actually works.

**Interrupt the panic loop in 5 seconds.** This tip came up repeatedly in Dr. Andrew Huberman’s work at Stanford. When you're spiraling with anxious thoughts mid-convo, your amygdala is in overdrive. The trick? Use a ""physiological sigh""—two sharp inhales through the nose, one slow exhale through the mouth. It takes under 5 seconds. Doing it once instantly calms your autonomic nervous system. You don’t need to leave the room or meditate for 30 minutes. Just breathe like that and your brain gets the message: we’re safe, we’re good.

**Name what’s happening.** Neuroscientist Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett (author of “How Emotions Are Made”) explains that labeling your emotional state can actually decrease its intensity. So if you're thinking “I sound stupid” while talking, mentally saying “I’m feeling anxious” gives your brain a sense of control. It’s simple, but it pulls you out of the spiral. Feeling in control is half the game.

**Redirect your attention outwards.** The Fogg Behavior Model says nerves spike when your “perceived ability” to succeed drops. So instead of trying to say the perfect thing, shift into observation mode. Look at someone’s hand gesture, their clothing texture, the sound of their voice. This reduces self-focus and builds real presence, which helps your brain feel safer.

**Reduce your ‘mental lag’ time.** According to Harvard psychologist Dr. Ellen Langer, becoming more mindful in micro moments literally changes your social cognition. One way? Start responding more quickly in low-stakes conversations. Don’t wait until you’ve formed the perfect sentence. That 3-second pause where you’re editing your thoughts? That’s where panic slips in. Say something—even if it’s “wait, what were you saying again?”—just to stay in the flow.

**You’re not awkward, you’re out of sync.** Neuroscientist Uri Hasson’s research at Princeton showed that when two people are really connecting, their brain waves literally sync up. But this takes time and safety. So if you feel “off” in a convo, it’s not a personality flaw. It just means the sync hasn’t clicked yet. Be patient, lower your expectations, and let the rhythm build.

Some resources that actually help build these skills:

**Book: ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer**  
Written by an ex-FBI agent who specialized in behavior analysis, this book is loaded with weirdly effective tricks for making people feel at ease—especially when you hate talking. It’s not cheesy or performative. It’s just practical. Schafer explains how small cues (like tilting your head slightly or timing your eye contact) can completely change how others respond to you. This is the best practical playbook for shy or socially anxious people. Insanely good read.

**Podcast: “The Social Skills Lab”**  
Hosted by behavioral coach Patrick King, this podcast cuts through the fluff. Each short episode breaks down real psychology on conversation, confidence, and charisma. It’s not cringe and doesn’t feel like a TED Talk. Episode titles like “How to Stop Overthinking in Conversations” and “How Not to Be a Dry Texter” are super specific and digestible.

**App: Finch**  
It doesn’t seem social on the surface, but Finch helps reduce the baseline anxiety that drives social avoidance. It's a self-care pet game app that gently pushes you to reflect on daily stress, track small wins, and plan your goals without guilt. Really helpful for building emotional regulation, which makes spontaneous socializing way easier.

**BeFreed**  
If you want deep learning without the overwhelm, BeFreed is game-changing. It’s an AI-powered personal learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It turns top-tier content—books, research, expert lectures—into a podcast feed that fits your brain and your lifestyle. You can pick your voice host (mine’s got a calm, smoky vibe), set your learning time to 10, 20, or 40 minutes, and it tailors everything to your growth goals using a smart adaptive plan. Think of it like Spotify for self-growth that actually gets smarter the more you use it. It has a MASSIVE library around social anxiety, confidence, and communication. And yes, every book and podcast I mentioned in this post is already on the app.

**Book: ""Stop Overthinking"" by Nick Trenton**  
This one went viral for a reason. It’s readable, no BS, and packed with cognitive-behavioral breakdowns about why we spiral in everyday interactions. Trenton isn’t just repeating platitudes—he actually maps out how to reverse the overthinking cycle with thought experiments and real rewiring techniques. This book will make you question everything you think you know about your anxious thoughts. Best anxiety interrupter book I’ve ever read.

**YouTube: Improvement Pill’s ""Social Skills"" Series**  
Free, visual, and super digestible. These animated videos explain the mechanics of small talk, charisma, and how to stop being socially awkward in different settings. The “4 Stages of Social Growth” video completely reframed how I think about skill-building for convo confidence. Perfect for visual learners who hate audiobooks.

**Audio: ""Unf*ck Your Brain"" by Kara Loewentheil**  
A former lawyer turned cognitive coach, Kara unpacks why high-performing, overthinking brains often sabotage social flow. Her podcast is part neuroscience, part mindset coaching, and has episodes like “Social Anxiety Is Not a Personality Trait” that hit like therapy.

1oonyt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1oonyt0/advice_on_cold_emailing_and_linkedin_dm_for/,Advice on cold emailing and Linkedin DM for opportunities.,"Hi r/auscorp,

I am a 1st year international student (Singapore) based in Adelaide. Currently studying a in Environmental Policy and Management. I have also attended networking/professional events to connect with professionals in this space. 

I’m looking for some direct advice on the best etiquette for reaching out to directors/managers on LinkedIn (and via cold email to companies) for an internship or any opportunity this summer break. 

Question: 

Which would be more effective? A direct message like ""I'm seeking an internship, do you know of any opportunities?"" or a softer ""Would you be open to a 15-min coffee chat to discuss your work in the sector?""

When sending a cold email, should I attach my resume upfront, or is it better to ask if they know of any opportunity in their network?

Is it a bad look to message senior people (Directors, Heads of) directly? Or is it better to target HR/Recruitment Directors?



TL;DR: International student with full-time summer availability needs advice on the most professional and effective way to cold-message for an internship.



Appreciate any insights or reality checks.

1oonxqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiaustralia/comments/1oonxqq/financial_independence_starts_with_small_wins/,"Financial independence starts with small wins, here’s how a coffee machine accidentally changed my spending","One way to move toward financial independence is by taking control of your spending. You don’t always need a big lifestyle change, sometimes a small shift can drag your monthly expenses way down without even realizing it.

Here’s something I found out completely by accident.

I used to have 1-2 coffees a day, and since I love almond milk, that alone adds about $1 extra per drink. Let’s say on average I was spending around $10 a day on coffee.

Since I work from home and can’t function without my morning coffee (and sometimes get too busy to go out for one), I decided to buy a coffee machine. I found a Lavazza coffee machine on sale for under $100, ordered it, and it arrived a few days later.

Honestly, my only intention at the time was just to deal with my morning cravings and not have to rush out first thing, I didn’t even think about the money impact.

Now, each coffee pod costs me between $0.66 and $0.94 (16 pods for $15 normally, or $10.50 when on sale). I usually have two coffees a day, so my new daily cost is:

- Low end: 0.66 × 2 = $1.32/day
- High end: 0.94 × 2 = $1.88/day

Let’s compare that to before:
- Old daily cost: $10.00
- New daily cost: $1.32–$1.88
- Daily savings: $8.12–$8.68

Now, here’s what that adds up to:
- Weekly savings: $56.84–$60.76
- Monthly savings (30 days): $243.60–$260.40

To talk about ROI, the machine basically paid for itself in less than two weeks.

I’ll admit, I still buy coffee outside sometimes, but nowhere near as much as I used to. The difference in convenience and savings has been huge.

Small, simple changes like this one can make a big difference over time.",11,1762301390.0,fiaustralia,11,0.92,False

In ""the gum""","Just watching the Season 7 episode 10 and noticed that when George bought the gum to look at the bills in the register he walks out the coffee shop without the gum. In the next scene Lloyd is in Jerry's apartment and offers some sticks of gum

Now the package of gum that George buys is a teal package that looks like it's sticks. And the gum that Lloyd offers is Yellow. So unsure if its the same gum or not.

Why Cotton Machine Washable Area Rugs Are a Total Game-Changer,"Let's be real. Life is messy. Spilled coffee, muddy paws, craft-time glitter explosions... your area rug bears the brunt of it all. For years, the solution has been a frustrating dance of spot treatments, professional cleanings, and just… living with the stains.

But what if you could just toss your entire area rug into the washing machine?

## What Exactly Are Cotton Machine Washable Area Rugs?

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

At their core, these are exactly what they sound like: area rugs made primarily from cotton that are designed and constructed to be machine washable.

Unlike traditional wool or synthetic rugs with thick, glued-on backings that would destroy your washing machine, these rugs are typically:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

*   **Made from 100% cotton or a cotton blend:** Cotton is naturally soft, durable, and—most importantly—washable.
*   **Flatweave or low-pile construction:** This makes them flexible, lightweight, and easy to fit into a standard home washing machine. They lack the heavy, dense pile of a shag or plush wool rug.
*   **Featuring a flexible backing:** Instead of a stiff rubber or latex back, they often have a simple, non-slip backing woven from cotton or a flexible synthetic material.

The result is a beautiful, functional rug that doesn't treat ""washable"" as a suggestion—it's its main superpower.

## The Unbeatable Benefits: Why You'll Love Them

Still on the fence? Let's break down why these rugs are winning over homeowners everywhere.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

### 1. Effortless Cleaning & Maintenance

This is the #1 reason. A spilled glass of red wine is no longer a catastrophe. It's a laundry load.
*   **Deep cleaning on demand:** No more renting a carpet cleaner or scheduling expensive professional cleanings. Just roll it up, and throw it in.
*   **Allergy-friendly:** Regular washing removes dust, dander, and allergens that get trapped in other rug fibers, leading to a healthier home environment.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

### 2. Incredibly Soft & Comfortable

Cotton is a naturally soft and breathable fiber. These rugs feel great underfoot—comfortable for barefoot walking and perfect for kids' play areas. They offer a cozy, casual vibe that's hard to beat.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

### 3. Perfect for Households with Kids & Pets

If you have tiny humans or four-legged family members, this is a non-negotiable benefit.
*   **Pet accidents?** Wash them out.
*   **Muddy paw prints?** Toss it in the wash.
*   **Crayon scribbles?** You know the drill.
These durable rugs can withstand the chaos of family life while looking great.

### 4. Breathable and Versatile

Cotton's breathability makes these rugs fantastic for any season. They don't trap heat, making them comfortable in warmer climates. Their lightweight nature also makes them ideal for layering over larger rugs or for use in spaces like bedrooms and kitchens.

### 5. Lightweight and Easy to Handle

Ever tried to haul a large 8x10 wool rug up a flight of stairs? It's a two-person job. Cotton washable rugs are light enough for one person to move, shake out, and easily load into the machine.

## How to Choose the Perfect Washable Cotton Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

Ready to buy one? Here’s what to look for.

### Consider the Room's Function

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

*   **Kitchen/Entryway:** Look for a **runner** or smaller size that can handle high traffic and spills. A darker color or a pattern with some visual texture can help hide dirt between washes.
*   **Living Room:** Choose a size that anchors your furniture. A soft, neutral cotton rug can create a cozy, inviting atmosphere.
*   **Bedroom:** Place it next to your bed for a soft landing in the morning. You don't need it to cover the entire floor, just the main traffic areas.
*   **Dining Room:** Ensure the rug is large enough that your chairs remain on it even when pulled out.

### Check the Backing

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

Look for a **non-slip backing**. Many washable cotton rugs come with a thin, flexible latex or non-slip dotted backing to prevent them from sliding on hard floors. This is a crucial safety feature.

### Pile and Weave Matter

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

While most are flatweave, some have a slightly higher low-pile construction.
*   **Flatweave:** The most common and easiest to wash. Very durable.
*   **Low-Pile:** A bit plusher and softer, but still very washable. Great for bedrooms and living rooms where you want more comfort.

## A Quick Guide: How to Wash Your Cotton Rug

It's simple, but a few best practices will keep your rug looking new for years.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

1.  **Check the Label First!** Always follow the manufacturer's specific instructions. They know their product best.
2.  **Shake it Out:** Before washing, take the rug outside and give it a good shake to remove loose dirt and debris.
3.  **Use a Commercial Washer (if needed):** For larger rugs (like a 6x9 or 8x10), your home machine might be too small. A commercial-grade washer at a laundromat is your best bet.
4.  **Wash in Cold Water:** Hot water can cause cotton to shrink. Use cold water on a gentle cycle.
5.  **Use a Mild Detergent:** Harsh chemicals can break down the cotton fibers. A gentle, plant-based detergent is ideal. Avoid bleach.
6.  **Air Dry is Key:** Do not put your cotton rug in the dryer. The high heat will cause significant shrinkage. The best method is to hang it outside on a clothesline or lay it flat to dry. It may take a day or two, but it's worth it.

> **Pro-Tip:** To speed up drying and prevent mildew, hang the rug over a railing or shower rod so air can circulate on all sides.

## The Honest Truth: Are There Any Downsides?

To give you the full picture, no product is perfect. Here are a couple of things to consider:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cotton%20machine%20washable%20area%20rugs)

*   **Not Ultra-Plush:** If you're looking for the deep, sink-your-toes-in softness of a high-pile shag rug, cotton washable rugs aren't it. They are more of a low-pile, cozy comfort.
*   **Wrinkling:** After washing, they may have some wrinkles. A quick iron on a low setting (with a cloth between the iron and the rug) can help, but most people find they smooth out on their own with foot traffic.
*   **Potential for Shrinkage:** If you ignore the ""cold water/air dry"" rule, you will end up with a smaller rug. Follow the instructions!

Basically they just bought her a coffee cup costume but then printed the Dutch Bros logo and stuck it on there so they could get a sponsorship. 🙄 Again, Abbie has become nothing but a prop and a billboard to them. 

But then in the description he mentions that next year *he wants to dress her up as a BROWN PAPER BAG.* You know, because she likes to rip up paper bags. And in the video, he reveals that this was Isaiah's idea...Asa even wonders how they'd pull that off and ""wouldn't she just shred it?"" (I wish she shredded the horrible Dutch Bros thing.) Asa and Priscilla proceed to explain how her costumes are picked based on ""what she likes that year"" and this was her first year having Dutch Bros. They mentioned other past humiliating costumes such as a cereal box and a fruit. Of course, they've showcased many of these themselves, such as the chicken suit from last year and the boom box from a few years ago. 

You can tell how much this is all for a sponsorship because they won't stop saying ""Dutch Bros, Dutch Bros, Dutch Bros"" over and over again throughout the video.

Ever have those days where you feel like you're just... treading water? You're busy, but not productive. You're okay, but not truly *happy*. It feels like you need a massive life overhaul, which is just exhausting to even think about.

I've been there. What changed the game for me wasn't some huge, complicated system. It was realizing that **massive change comes from tiny, consistent actions.**

We're not trying to rebuild the entire house today. We're just going to fix a leaky faucet and clean a window. Here are a few dead-simple ""hacks"" that can genuinely shift your entire day if you just try them:

*   **The ""Two-Minute"" Annihilator:** See a task that takes less than two minutes? Just do it. Immediately. Replying to that one email, putting a dish in the dishwasher, taking out the trash. It's wild how much mental clutter this clears up. You're not just doing the task; you're killing the ""I need to do that"" thought that would have followed you around for hours.

*   **The ""Win the Morning"" Hydration Station:** Before you even think about coffee or your phone, chug a glass of water. Seriously. You're dehydrated after sleeping. Giving your brain and body water first is a tiny act of self-respect that sets a positive tone for the next 16 hours. You start the day with a win.

*   **The ""Forced Gratitude"" Mind Trick:** Feeling meh? Stop what you're doing and find **one** thing in your immediate vicinity you're grateful for. Your comfy chair. The hot coffee in your mug. The fact that the internet is working. It sounds cheesy, but it's impossible to be anxious or unhappy in the exact same moment you're feeling genuinely grateful. It's like a mini-reboot for your mood.

Sometimes, though, these little hacks can feel like putting a band-aid on a bigger issue. I know for a fact that if your emotional foundation is shaky, no amount of productivity tricks will stick. It's like trying to build a skyscraper on sand. For a while, I struggled with that underlying ""blah"" feeling until I found a more structured way to get my head straight. If you're in that boat and need help untangling your thoughts, I genuinely found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) to be incredibly helpful for getting that core emotional support in place.

But start small. Don't try to do everything. Just pick one of these. Try it for the rest of the day and see what happens.

1oonmo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1oonmo1/i_screamed_at_my_husband_in_front_of_my_toddler/,"I screamed at my husband in front of my toddler, and I'm so scared I've irreparably damaged our relationship.","TLDR: things got too much for me, and I badly lashed out at my husband in front of my 2-year-old for the first time in her life. How do you repair your toddler's shattered sense of calm and safety? And restore her trust in her mother, so that I can be her safe haven again?

My family has been going through a lot lately. My mother-in-law sadly unexpectedly developed cancer and died this year, in a very short space of time (less than a year). My husband and I have also been dealing with secondary infertility and three early miscarriages, and that has been pretty all-consuming for me. And of course, we still have everything life is throwing at us: financial worries, struggling to maintain our lives, and our household feeling like the world is on fire, and our lives are cracking apart.

It's been really tough.

I've been largely solo-parenting for a good couple of months while my husband has been caring for his dying mother, and now that he's grieving her passing, even more has fallen on me. Please understand that I do know that now is my time to step up and be the perfect wife - it's the time between the death and the funeral, and he's so, so sad. I need to be a rock, right now.

But I've crumbled; I lost my fucking mind yesterday. My husband and I have a long-standing issue with him not doing enough around the house to help me. Lately, he's pulled back even more to the point where he'll barely lift a finger to help with the housework. But, he made me a cup of coffee when I came down yesterday morning, which I really appreciated. ...Until I got to the bottom of the cup, I noticed it had bits kinda floating in it, and then I realised, the cup had been one of the ones that had been sitting in his office for god knows how long. And he hadn't bothered to wash the cup before he gave me the coffee.

Aaaaand it was like the flood-gates exploded; it was like every stress that's been on me for the past... I don't know, 6 months? Came out all at once, and I just lost it at my husband. I ranted and raved at him for... Maybe 10 full minutes? In the process, I threw my daughter's doll on the sofa, and apparently, I kicked her toy pram? (I don't remember this, but my husband said I did).

This is probably the first time my 27-month-old has seen either of us get genuinely angry. We've been snippy, but not like this. She was really, really distraught, she was saying 'mummy shouting', 'mummy don't shout!' Last night, after things calmed down a bit. It obviously affected her really badly.

It's the next day, and honestly, she's not really wanted much to do with me. She's always been a bit of a daddy's girl, but now I'm actively the enemy - I haven't been able to comfort her, or hang out with her without her asking, 'Where's daddy?' Or really anything. She hurt herself this afternoon, slipping on something, and he's all she wanted.

I'm so regretful of my outburst, I feel like I should have handled my stress better, and remembered that none of this is her fault - she deserves calm, loving parents. She doesn't deserve to feel my anger.

Does anyone have any advice as to what to do going forward? I feel like my daughter's world was shattered yesterday. We have always been a calm, happy home, and I feel like she now doesn't trust that her world is safe. And I don't know what to do to fix that. I don't feel like it's the sort of thing that can be fixed? Trust once broken isn't easily mended. She knows now that I'm capable of being so unstable and getting so angry.

THREE STARS","This is the first time I've ever commented on another Viner's reviews here in two years in the program. But how the hell do you write a review like this and give it three stars. Do you not know how people perceive Amazon review scores? A 4.2 average is an absolute death knell in electronics, where this case fits. If your careless 3-star review is the first one, it will take ten more 5-star reviews to get it up to the 4.8 range where users will simply click ""buy"" with a glance at the review score instead of diving into why the score isn't perfect.

I have worked at three different companies for about 13 years that sold through Amazon, and dumbass reviews like this were the reason I actually convinced a $2B company to pull out of the Vine program for four years. We got worse reviews through Vine than we got afterwards from the people who actually wanted and purchased our $300 product. Vine reviewers were actually rating it lower simply so they didn't seem like shills even after saying it was awesome. If you can't find anything wrong with it, give it five stars! It's not that hard.

EDIT: After a commenter pointed out that the review is likely AI-generated, I think there's an even greater sin here. I hated part of this product and debated between a 3- and 4-star rating. I wonder if the reviewer actually also hated it and the 3-star rating is what's honest, and was just too lazy to tell the AI to write text consistent with a 3-star rating.

For the benefit of idiots or novices or thoughtful reviewers, here are my personal guidelines.

**Five**: Does what it's supposed to and does it well.

**Four**: Does what it's supposed to, but there are a few annoyances I have to work around (like sizing being off a bit so you need to pay attention to get the right one).

**Three**: Does what it's supposed to, but not well. Buy something better. (E.g. a toy that breaks after 4 weeks of play).

**Two**: Does what it's supposed to, but barely, and not without a bunch of work on my part. You'll hate this. (E.g. a shoe rack so rickety that you need to tie part of it together with twine to brace it -- true story)

***Memory Transcription Subject: Loaxly, Ambushed Sivkit***

*Time: Day of The Lively Jog*

*It was a good run.*

It was only a matter of time before my turn would come up. Safety in the city had been going down the drain for cycles now, constant predator attacks popping up left and right almost every week. Usually, I'd be safe manning the desk for the apartment complex. The metal shutters we had installed on the front entrance had served us well so far. Until now. The moment I saw them stalking down the road, I pressed the hidden switch to activate the security system. There was no response.

Of all the times to fail, it had to be now. Not once since we had them installed had they failed us. Why now?

It didn't really matter. What mattered was that they *did* fail. The predators were coming this way.

At least, that's what I presumed they were. Their eye placement was a dead giveaway. What wasn't obvious is why they were here. Or what they even were.

Take a deep breath. Lay out your thoughts.

First, we can assume they are in fact, predators. Second, they were lugging around what was unmistakably luggage. Mindless beasts didn't use tools. That means they were sapient.

How can there be sapient predators? Think. If the Federation were to discover another race of sapient predators, they would immediately be quarantined, or exterminated. In the present case, that would mean that the Federation did not, in fact, choose either of those options. Why do I know that? Because the predators are *here*. As if they travelled. Under that assumption, they must have arrived at the planet through official means. However, I know that nobody gets on or off planet here without approval of the Exterminator Guild. That means the Guild willingly brought sapient predators to our city. Normally that would be unthinkable, but the evidence immediately dashes that disbelief to pieces as they are, in fact, here.

I still didn't know how to feel about the situation. The predators' walk had progressed halfway from where I first noticed them.

*Finish laying out your thoughts.*

The Guild brought to our city a pair of sapient predators. The predators are carrying luggage. They are walking towards an apartment complex.

Two days ago I received notice that a pair of new tenants would move in soon.

The predators were going to move in with us.

Considering this is all contingent on Guild approval, that means there is no danger.

One day ago I received notice that the residency had been cancelled for the new tenants, and the notice included a new address to turn them away to.

Considering this is all contingent on Guild approval, that means they are civilized, will understand the bureaucratic inconvenience, and will peacefully move on to the new address, once I notify them of the change.

The predators were almost at the sidewalk.

*Finish laying out your thoughts.*

My entire reasoning is based on the assumption that the Guild brought these predators to the city.

I know for a fact that a Sivkit like me couldn't reach such a well-reasoned conclusion without messing up somewhere. Therefore, one of my assumptions is wrong. The biggest assumption I made was that the Guild approved of this.

Therefore the Guild did *not* approve of this. That means the predators snuck onto the planet, and were walking towards an apartment with what is probably a full set of butchering tools in their bags. They were coming here and they were *almost at the door and they're HERE FOR ME. THEY'RE GOING TO EAT ME.* ***THEY TRAVELLED ALL ACROSS THE GALAXY SPECIFICALLY TO EAT ME IN PARTICULAR!!!***

I yanked open the utility closet's door and dove in, banging my head against some shelves and denting them more than they already were, while also knocking some items off. I slowly closed the door shut as I heard the entrance chime ring out.

I put my ear to the door and waited. Plenty of time to think of a plan to get out of here. A well-reasoned, logical plan. I need to think. I need to stay calm and focused.

**\[Time advance: 30 minutes\]**

*They're waiting me out.* They know I'm in here and they're relishing in my terror. They must be. Why wouldn't they have followed the scent trails they clearly can follow like it's second nature? Can they smell my fear? Is that why they haven't barged in yet? Because they like the scent?

How *twisted*.

The fear in my nervous system had begun wearing off as the wait became longer and longer. At some point I simply started to get bored. Would they do something already? The wait is worse than whatever they have planned, just do *somethi-*

\*clack\*

I jolted away from the door. One of them just touched the handle. Oh stars it's happening. Time to set my plan into motion. The moment they open the door, I would start wildly throwing random items in hopes of stunning them long enough for me to slip by through the door. This'll work.

The door creaked as it slowly swung open.

*It's time!*

I grabbed the first object next to me. The object happened to be one of the shelf's dented supports. It must have been on its last legs as the yank was enough to cause the entire thing to crumple under the weight of its contents. I saw the shelf tip over above me almost in slow motion.

*Oh. So* ***this*** *is how I die.*

The objects began to spill over the edge as the frame continued to tilt. As the supplies covered me in what surely must be a veritable pile of cleaning materials, the shelf finally fell with a bang. Confused, I peeked out of a gap in the mound and saw that the top of the shelf simply hit the other shelf and rested there, tilted over me.

*I'm alive!*

Then I remembered the reason I was in this room in the first place. Without moving my body, I turned my eye towards the door. There it stood. My eye's movement must have caught its attention because its own eyes snapped directly towards mine.

*Plan B, Plan B!*

*...what was plan B?* Oh right! How could I forget. It was as foolproof as plan A, I was simply too great of a fool for that first plan. This one was even better thought out and would surely work.

I filled my lungs to their utmost capacity and screamed.

***""PLEASE! PLEASE SOMEONE SAVE MEEEE! I DON'T WANT TO DIIIIIEEEEEEEE!!!""***

***Memory Transcription Subject: Mateo Terronez, startled ex-napping Human***

I jolted awake out of my blissful bout of sleep. I looked around in slight panic, noticing Caroline standing in front of an open door, holding her hands over her ears.

Before the racket could continue for too long, she slammed the door shut, muffling the noise from within.

""What the hell?"" I asked.

""Oooowwwww. Hold on, *ow*."" she grimaced as she held up a hand. ""Ears still ringing.""

I made my way over to her, warily keeping an eye on the door. ""What in the world was that about?""

""I don't know! I just opened the door and whoever is in there started screaming bloody murder.""

""Murder?! Blood?!"" came the voice from within.

...

""It's a figure of speech."" I said.

""How barbaric!""

Caroline decided to yank the reigns on the conversation.

""Okay we're getting nowhere. Why are you screaming? You don't... actually think we're gonna eat you, right? That's crazy!""

""...you're not?""

""Of course not!"" I joined her. ""We're here to move in. You know, living in this building, as neighbors. We're not... monsters.""

""*...you're not?*""

Confident in the idea that I could handle this conversation, Caroline decided to let me continue.

""Of course not. We're just refugees. We don't want any trouble, we just want to get settled in and finally rest for a bit. We're exhausted. That's all.""

""Refugees? You're saying you were brought here, to this planet, officially?""

""Yes?""

""By the Exterminator's Guild?""

""Yes.""

""And you're moving in, like citizens?""

""Yes!""

""Oh no..."" he mumbled, almost inaudibly through the door.

""What? What's wrong?"" I prodded.

""You're stupid.""

""...what""

""Like me... okay, I guess I'll play along. I received notice that you two were going to move in. Supposedly. But that tenancy was cancelled, you've been redirected to another housing unit.""

Caroline groaned out loud.

""For the love of fuck. We gotta keep walking?"" She snipped.

Suppressing a groan of my own, I decided to keep things diplomatic.

""That's... unfortunate. But I guess it's out of your hands, no?""

The alien took a second before responding. ""You're just gonna acknowledge the paperwork mishap and not take your anger out on me?""

""Not much else we can do.""

I could barely hear him mumble to himself, before properly addressing us directly.

""The address you need is on the pad at the desk. If you're telling the truth, just save the address and move on.""

""I... thanks. I guess. Say, I don't think I caught your name.""

""...Loaxly. You never mentioned yours either.""

""I'm Mateo! And the lovely creature that spooked you earlier is my sister, Caroline. Pleased to meet you!""

*Could this be the first friend I make?*

""I did nothing wrong, so I won't apologize for startling you earlier."" Caroline quipped as she picked up the pad, writing down the address displayed on it.

Quietly, so that Carly wouldn't hear me, I came closer to the door and whispered to the alien. ""Hey, any chance we can exchange contact info?""

""What? Why?!""

""Hey hey ssshhh! Listen, you seem like a swell guy, and it feels like nobody else in the city will give me the time of day. Maybe we could chat! Maybe we could be friends?""

""...why are you reinforcing my delusions?""

""What?""

""Nothing. Nevermind. If you truly believe your own fabrication, maybe we're kindred spirits in idiocy.""

""...we're really not lying, we just want to have a place to stay and get along.""

After a heartbeat or two, I heard a sniffle from beyond the door.

""You really are like me... for real...""

""Er, I guess?""

""...sure, let's do this. Copy the contact info from my pad and leave yours. Maybe we could chat.""

*Yes!*

""*Mateo*, I don't know what you're whispering over there but I got the address. Let's go.""

""Coming!"" I called back before whispering through the door one last time. ""We'll keep in touch Loaxly. Oh this'll be great!""

""If you say so...""

**\[Time advance: 10 minutes\]**

We didn't speak at all on the way to the new address. We were too tired to. Yet again, every aliens bolted the moment they saw us. Some even fell over and got trampled by others, giving them no mind. At least none of them got hurt, as they would stand right back up and run along with the rest.

It was disheartening. It made me feel like a monster.

When we reached the new building, before we even had a chance to enter, some metal shutters slammed down over the entrance.

""...that's a bit drastic don't you think?"" I mumbled.

Caroline decided, instead, to bang on the shutters.

""Hey! Open up! The Guild gave us a place to stay in this building!""

A deep voice bellowed from within.

""Go away! It ain't here you're staying!""

""What?"" asked Carly.

""They moved you off to the building across the street! Now git! Move!""

""Oh you cannot be serious.""

The voice from within said nothing.

**\[Time advance: 2 hours\]**

Seven places. We were sent ping-ponging for seven different places. Each and every one of them said they received a notice that we were to be staying elsewhere. My feet were killing me. I was closer to falling asleep than ever before, and I was getting hungry.

""FUCK"" shouted Carly, startling the latest receptionist we've met so far.

""I'm so so sorry! Please don't hurt me!"" a coffee mug whimpered. Or rather, the tiny alien that took refuge within it. A Dossur, I think they were called.

""Listen here. We've been walking around this stupid city for the past two hours and *nobody* lets us in a room. You are the *seventh* guy to send us away!""

""H-hey! At least there's good news!""

Carly loomed over the desk and picked up the mug, glaring into it at the fuzzy puffball within.

""You better be very careful with your next words. *What*, pray tell, could be the good news?""

The offending mug squeaked out a tiny sob before blubbering. ""T-there's two places you're being sent to! That's twice the chances they'll be the correct one!""

The ensuing ten seconds of silence were the loudest I've ever experienced. I was getting really worried Carly would throw the mug at a wall and hurt the alien.

Instead, she slowly lowered it back down, trapping the dossur yet again, and took two steps away from the desk.

She opened her suitcase, took out a wad of clothes, bundled them up into a ball, and put her face to it.

She let out the most frustrated, muffled scream I've ever heard in my entire life.

""Hey."" I tried getting the alien's attention in a soft voice. ""What do you mean there's two places to check?""

""I- I- I dunno! I got two notifications on my pad. They're near identical, but they mention two entirely d-diferent places. I-I can't tell if there was a glitch in the system, or if one overrides the other. They have the same timestamp! ...I don't know which one to send you to...""

""Can't you at least call them? Ask them which is it? Please, we're almost dead on our feet here, we've been walking for hours."" I pleaded.

""I did! Before you got here, I called both places, but nobody responded in either case. I'm so so sorry!""

Pinching the bridge of my nose, I let out an exasperated sigh. ""Alright. How about this. Carly, we split up, you go to one of these places, I go to the other. Whatever ends up being the right one, we meet up back here.""

""What?! *Why* are you coming back here?!"" interjected the tiny alien.

""To pick up our luggage. We aren't lugging this around anymore. It won't be a problem with you, if we leave it here while we keep searching, right?"" *Please say it's okay.*

""I'd... rather you didn-""

""*Please.*""

""O-okay...""

""Thank you, *so* much. C'mon Caroline, let's get this over with. Which one'll you take?""

***Memory Transcription Subject: Caroline Shaw, Library Archivist***

*Last stop.*

I shove the door open and barge in. For once, there's someone still at the receptionist's desk. For once, they don't immediately cower or scream. For once, they remain stoic and professional, and calm... and collected...?

""Miss Caroline, I presume."" Greeted the spiky alien.

*Okay, now* ***that's*** *weird.*

I walked up to her. ""Let me guess, you got notice that we should go somewh-"".

""Nothing of the sort."" She rudely interrupted.

""O-kay? So we're staying here, then? Actually? For reals? No take-backsies?""

""No 'take-backsies'.""

*Oh thank fucking god.*

""Oh you have no idea the marathon everyone's had us running. Alright, give me a couple minutes, I'm gonna go get my bro-""

""I'm afraid that will have to wait.""

What.

""Due to the relocation, your acceptance of this residence needs to be completed in a timely manner. I have here the requisite paperwork, but it needs completing *now*, else you risk the case being dropped entirely.""

""You're joking. Come on, just give me a couple minut-""

""I am quite serious."" The Gojid gestured to the six pads laid out on the counter between us. ""Here you will find all the required forms and documentation. If you would be so kind as to get started right away, and complete it all in a timely manner.""

*Mateo can work it out. When he sees I'm not at the agreed-on place, he'll just go to the second location, mine.*

My voice was already hoarse from screaming into the luggage earlier. I really wished I had brought it with me.

I picked up a pad, and started reading.

***Memory Transcription Subject: Mateo Terronez, Civil Engineering Student***

I tried my best to appear as inconspicuous as possible on my way here, but nothing I did changed anyone's reactions. The rumors must have circulated already of our arrival. All it took was seeing someone wearing clothes and everyone would make a wide berth if not outright flee from me. I really didn't want to cause any of these people any distress, but it's difficult when merely breathing in their general direction causes them to panic.

On the way, however, something strange happened. Despite the mini-stampedes that resulted everywhere I walked, there was an alien that simply didn't run. It wasn't that they fell, or were abandoned by those around it. They simply... didn't want to run.

*Are they not afraid?*

Not wanting to ruin this chance, I refrained from approaching. If they felt safe enough, they would approach on their own. I did, however, give a small wave.

""Hello.""

A couple seconds passed by before they approached me, flicking an ear once on the way.

""Hello."" My translator helpfully clarified the voice to be female for her species. I was still not entirely sure what her species was, but she looked somewhat like a bipedal sugar glider. Ish. If you squinted a little.

""You're not scared of me?""

""You're a predator."" She noted, catching me off guard.

""I... I guess? That didn't answer my questio-""

""You can talk.""

""Ah... yeah. I said hello.""

""You're a person."" Somehow the most validating thing I've been told since we got here, and yet it still felt insulting.

""I... okay this is getting weird. Are you okay?""

She tilted her head, before asking ""How did you get here?""

""I'm a refugee. I'm fleeing my planet, since it's gonna get glassed.""

""No, I mean, how, physically, did you get on this planet? How did you get into the city?""

""The... exterminator's guild? They helped transport us onto the surface and pointed me to where I'm going to stay.""

Something about that response did not sit well with her, as she shrunk in on herself, pinning her ears back and curling her tail around her feet. I barely caught her mutter *""I knew it""*

""Hey, is everything alri-""

""You have to come with me.""

*A bit pushy, don't you think?*

""No. Listen, lady, it was nice meeting someone that didn't bolt at the sight of me, but I'm a bit busy, and tired, and there are things I *need* to do to even get a chance to rest."" To that, she had no response.

We stared at each other awkwardly for a couple moments before I decided to move on.

""Wait!""

""What?"" I asked, exasperated.

""Take my contact info. If you won't come with me, at least keep my contact. Please, it's important.""

""Listen, I don't even know you, and as much as I'd love to meet new people, you're giving me the creeps. Have a nice day.""

She didn't try to stop me as I walked away.

**\[Time advance: 15 minutes\]**

I made it. And what greeted me was not inspiring. The building was run-down, it had window-panes missing, the door was crooked and ajar, and weeds were growing through the cracks on the walkway. It was a mess. For the first time today I hoped whoever was here would send me away somewhere else. But for that to happen, I needed to at least enter and ask.

As I open the door, the hinges squeak at me angrily, and light starts to slowly filter into the dusty room. The inside of the building looked no better, tiles were cracked or outright missing. But what filled me with unease was that it was dark. Not a single light was on in the room.

*This can't be right.*

Just to confirm to myself that this really was not the intended destination, I took a step in and almost gagged at the horrid stench that suddenly assaulted my nostrils the moment I crossed the threshold.

I stood still for a few seconds, letting my eyes adjust to the darkness. As I did, I noticed buzzing sounds nearby. Looking around, I started making out some details around me.

The place was definitely abandoned. No furniture remained in one piece, except for the main desk of the lobby. Seats were smashed, a table was bent in half, and there were even scorch marks on some of the walls. What got my attention, though, was the buzzing sounds. They were coming from the main desk. I slowly made my way over, feeling a foreboding sense of dread with each step I took. Something was screaming at me to get away, and yet... I had to know. Once I got close enough, my view crested over the back of the desk, allowing me to see what was behind, and...

and...

*What.*

*What the HELL?!*

I screamed, stumbling back and tripping over a toppled chair. I fell backwards,catching the fall with my hands.

""DAMMIT!""

The fall didn't matter. I had to get out of here, and *now*. I grit my teeth as I held my bruised hand to myself, got up, and scrambled out of the building. Rushing out, I tried to collect myself.

I was out. Outside the building. Away from- away from...

I doubled over and wretched onto the floor. There was nothing in my stomach for it to empty itself as I hadn't eaten in days, but it attempted to expel something anyway. The meager stomach acids burned my throat as they decided, just as I had, that they wanted *out*.

It wasn't until my stomach calmed down that I realized I was sobbing.

*What is wrong with this planet?* ***Why*** *is this happening? What is the meaning of all this? All the walking, the redirects, the hunger.*

I sat on the sidewalk, trying desperately not to think of what I found in the building, lest my stomach decide to make itself known again. I tried fumbling around for my pad, only to realize I left it with my luggage at the meet-up point.

Before I had much time to bemoan my lack of forethought, I heard a creak back at the entrance of the building. When I looked back, I noticed for the first time the large shutter boxes intalled over the doors and windows. I hadn't given much notice to them, as it seemed standard across most buildings we came across here, although they felt massively out of place with how new they looked on a decidedly abandoned building.

Suddenly, out of the metal boxes unrolled metal shutters, landing on the ground with a clang. Nobody could get in, or out of the building. I wasn't sure why that happened, but I wasn't going to complain. It kept me away from... from what was *in there*.

*Good.*

A couple seconds after, an extremely screechy tone played across the many sirens I had noticed across the city.

**""WARNING. A WILD** ***-KSSHHH-*** **\[HUMAN\]** ***-KSSHHH-*** **HAS BEEN SPOTTED INSIDE THE CITY BORDERS. STAY INSIDE YOUR HOMES, OR FIND REFUGE IN A SECURE BUILDING.

I looked up around me, and noticed that, as always, people at a distance would take out their pads and seemingly call someone. Unlike other times, where the calls would go unanswered, this time they seemed to be going through. And the callers were pointing at me, frantically.

***Memory Transcription Subject: Caroline Shaw, Library Archivist***

""Aaaaand done!"" I beamed. I looked back up at the receptionist except... she was gone? I looked around, and she was nowhere to be found. That was, until I heard a click. Looking at the source, I saw a frosted glass door leading further into the building, presumably having just been locked, and through it, the sillhouette of the very Gojid I had been speaking to just a moment earlier.

*Might just have had other things to deal with while I did this. Anyway, time to go get Mateo, and finally get a moment of rest.*

As I started to stack the pads onto a corner, ready to leave, a wailing screech played from the sirens outside.

**""WARNING. A WILD** ***-KSSHHH-*** **\[HUMAN\]** ***-KSSHHH-*** **HAS BEEN SPOTTED INSIDE THE CITY BORDERS. STAY INSIDE YOUR HOMES, OR FIND REFUGE IN A SECURE BUILDING.

The sutters on the front entrance and windows began to roll down.

*No. No no NO NO NO.*

Without thinking twice, I grabbed one of the sturdy looking metal vases and smashed the large glass window with it. I immediately followed through the hole, accidentally cutting myself on my shoulder by the jagged glass that remained. That didn't matter. I ungracefully landed on the ground outside as the shutters clanged closed, where a small crowd of aliens had wandered close by. They screamed. They pointed. They ran. One, however, stayed behind, took out their pad, and started dialing.

If you guys can help me get in contact with her. So after I screwed up, not looking for sympathy but I tried getting a pltk if you know what I mean from Danao, if it wasn't clear. But it was over our agreed price and I wanted to leave a little something for my niece. Then several months later from end of March until July 2023 I was bed ridden, only went out of my room to go to the cr. Had mold grow on my food, didn't put that to waste, cry myself to sleep every other night. Went from 180 to 140,was  barely able stand on my own two feet for more than 5 minutes. Attempted leaving the station twice, once Robin Williams style (RIP Robin Williams). Got the help I needed at the mental unit, ever since then I just think about her and smile, FYI it hurts my face when I smile. In Part 1 I mentioned I took my first photos with her as a couple and those were basically the first photos where I was genuinely smiling from ear to ear. Next to the photos of me carrying my precious niece in my arms for the first time. I'll say it now my niece's and the rest of my family are a God send, if it weren't for them, not to be oa but I honestly don't think I'd be alive right now if it wasn't for them. It's not just how crappy I feel after losing the love of my life is the fact that I've been an embarrassment, failure, loser to my family for so long. Only recently have I started to improve. But you guys and God are my Sanctuary my saving grace, so I'll do whatever I can to make you guys proud. Although I wake up thinking she's laying there next to me in my arms or that sometimes I imagine us cuddling up to some k-drama. I know that's not the case but it's a comforting but sad thought. Still longing to feel her warm embrace, to feel like I'm back home again, to feel her dainty, gentle fingers but strong hands intertwined with mines again. To see my world in her eyes again to finally make it a reality. That lively and quirky smile and bright twinkling eyes that light up the night sky. I don't need no stars above when I know I can just look or in this case imagine the look in her eyes when she looks back at me. We started dating October 10, 2021 if I kept my promise to her and all things went well, by October 10, 2025 I would've proposed to her. I know this cause I tried to move on. Last year I met a girl online we dated for almost 5 months, talked about marriage, kids, a family. Ever since I was a kid I dreamt about what my wedding would be like, what it would be like to be a father. Thinking about it more these days cause my younger cousin just got married last week, btw congratulations cuz wish you both the best! So this girl I was having these serious conversations with, she sent me a picture of the ring she wants, she gave her ring size with not much trouble (told her I want to get matching couple rings). Then cause of a mistake I made in the first month of the relationship she decided not to accept the ring (I got the engagement ring she wanted as a promise ring). I was also this girl's first romantic interest to give her flowers, got her family a 15-20 kg pig for lechon for Christmas which they haven't had in 2 years. I talk to her mom every now and then, even learned a little bit of her mom's language. Then I met a delightful girl here in Cebu, from reddit we had 2 dates got along, but came to an understanding that were not ready for a relationship and would like to not be exclusive. Eventually we kinda caught feelings for each other. Then eventually I met someone online, I told her thinking she would be happy for me, which she was but now cause of that, we're not on speaking terms. Right now I'm tired of all the games. I'm in a better place now though, currently learning 2 languages, learning an instrument, planning to compete in multiple sports this year, goals of making the national team in 2 sports, learning cryptography, learning how to sing and dance, teaching judo, trying to teach English online and or work at a call center or something amongst other things. Going to go back to school to study and become a doctor. If you know this girl it would be greatly appreciated if you can bring this message to her attention. Her nickname is the same as this powdered candy that rhymes with pik nik, her initials AA the only AA I need, she graduated BEED I think in June 2025 from university of Cebu. Tomboy but knows how to dress yo the nines, skincare routine typically is instant coffee and or honey from what I can remember, is from Buanoy, has 4 other siblings, 2 of them has kids, one is my age and she has a younger brother. She likes to joke around, but serious when she needs to be, has her own language but I don't entirely remember, probably could still decipher it though. Likes pop, k-pop, r&b, reggae, African music don't know the genre, dance hall I guess, again I'm not sure of the genre, Rap, opm, obm, hip hop, I'm sure other things as well. Her tik tok videos had songs like someone you loved, trevor Daniel falling, Ali Gatie it's you, doja cat like that, Ariana grande 34+35, PsychedelicBoyz batang pasaway, skusta Clee susunod na lang, Cookies Bisdako, RKteQ Bisaya, na-unsa diay ka, Soulthrll cutie uyyy, miguel sure thing, Justin Bieber yummy, sza the weekend, Semme do Dat and other songs. Her bias when we first started dating was J Hope, then midway through Jungkook and before we broke up it was Suga. She's into K drama, but also C drama and Thai drama shows I think. Her favourite foods according to her mother cause for some reason she didn't want to tell me, is bam-i, spaghetti I think, paklay and their was something else but that's all I can remember for now. She also really likes buwad, she actually got me yo like it enough to be ok with eating it when it's around, when growing up I avoid it like the plague. She a thick girl but she's athletic, playful, absolutely amazing with kids, stern and religious but doesn't shove it down your throat. She's a flirt and I think not on purpose just like me, both our parents separated from their partners in the same year I believe, basically for the same reason too, I believe she also deals with depression as well. She loves coffee, I love coffee and I can make a mean Vietnamese coffee thinking of starting my own café one day. Her name is similar to the title of this sitcom from 1986-1990 about an alien and his life with your typical suburban family. Her name is a combination of her parents name. Her Mom's birthday is September 13th, they both do the same job basically just different aspects or roles. I'm not sure if I already said this but if I didn't F up big time, I would've been engaged to this remarkable human being, but I am an idiot sometimes. Biggest mistake and regret of my life, other things I can reconcile and get over but I'd never get over this. Wherever you are I'm sincerely sorry, if you were able to love me the way you did when I was f'ing up in life,  I'm in a much better place now, I know you don't need me to be happy, you're the type of person that is happy no matter what life throws at you. Although that's the case I believe that I can potentially enrich you're life and make your dreams more of a possibility, I hope this finds you and that you'd consider giving me a second chance. If not I guess I'm dying alone.",1,1762300296.0,cebur4r_dating,0,1.0,False

I’m not against a relationship but I really don’t fall for people until I’ve known them awhile and formed a platonic relationship so just expect friends for now.

I text the most in the evenings as I work 8-5pm. I am a lead co teacher in a 1 year old classroom. I have 2 dogs with my roommate. I love almost any music including Hozier, Ciggarettes After Sex, Ethan Jewel, The Crawlers, Cage the Elephant, RKS, RHCP, McCafferty, The Neighborhood, just a lot lol. I write some poetry here and there. I really like late night drives, exploring new areas or stores, I love finding new coffee shops. I really love Avatar the Last Airbender and also despise Legend of Korra. I want a monocycle rly bad someday but Im not with they’re financially (I would backpack just saying).

I am a bit socially awkward so I usually text pretty good but I get more nervous when calling or actually meeting someone. Ideally I think someone who’s a little more social would be nice to kinda push me out of my comfort zone both in simply getting to know each other and in doing things I might be unsure of doing alone like going to a rave or exploring abandoned areas, which I have yet to do.

I do tend to be pretty blunt and or sarcastic, not everyone loves that so just a heads up. I’m also not against photos or name dropping but I will wait probably about 3 days to a week to assess vibe before sending any or sharing my name.

1oondtx,https://i.redd.it/w0dercukubzf1.jpeg,"I’m writing a book of my grandpa’s life, and I was left his coffee mug in his will. I’d LOVE advice on an art project about the cup! Details in the body","I’ve been planning this book a long time and it’s been waiting in line behind another series I had to finish and now, it’s grandpa’s turn. 

I felt grateful for the inspiration when I sat down to write the first bit to make my writing tea in his cup, not mine. 

Then I had the idea to drink out of his cup everytime I write in his book. 

Then I had the idea to keep tallies, and find out how many cups of tea it took to write his book. 

Then I had the idea to go ahead and make it a nice little project instead of just tallies in my notebook. 

The plan, as it stands, is this. I bought a 11x14 canvas and id like to draw the cup actual size right in the center of the canvas. My drawing ability is limited but it’s a simple cup. I think ill do a dark black outline of the cup in a nice heavy black pen, then color the browns in with colored pencils (I’ve done a bunch of coloring books so I feel like I can do decently at this part I suppose). Then I’ll hang it up in my office and just start adding tally’s to it everytime I make a cup. (1-3 cups per writing day, 2-4 writing days per week). The final product will be the cup in the center with a background of a whole bunch of tallies.

A simple piece, but personally meaningful. Like it might not look like much to anyone else, but it’ll carry meaning for me. A tribute to a man who deserves my tribute. 


I like this project as is, but I feel like it’s missing *something*. Perhaps there is some other element or something other idea or some other feature or some other twist I could add!! 

So please, if you’re reading this, if you have ANY inspiration AT ALL— please share it with me!! No wrong answers in brain storming and who knows, one idea might lead to another which might lead to another then suddenly I have an epiphany!!

(That’s not his actual cup that’s just a picture from the internet that looks quite similar).

Hello community,

I hope its fine for me to be writing this, to understand someone i've met last year.

I met this person back in last winter, they were working at a small coffee shop im used to go to. After some time, we started to talk quite a bit and they were always seemingly happy to see me, always the one to initiate conversation, asking questions, making jokes, sharing much of their personal life, difficult times, and overhaul invested in these little pep talks.

This went on for a few months, we even met outside of their job, with their friends and all was great !

Their contract weren't renewed, mainly because of ADHD, so we haven't seen each other since early-mid summer. But they did contact me back in September to ask me if I would like to grab a drink with them if i passed by their city.

Invitation which I was exited about but couldn't accept until these past weeks, due to work being too much.

Almost every time I texted them (which is not a lot because I do not want to be the pushy friend) this is how it goes :

\- Sometimes they do reply after a few days (ofc its fine we all have our adult lives) , sending 5 to 7 messages all at once 

\- Other times, a week (or more ?) passes by and when they reply, they kind of ignore the previous topic ?

\- And the only few times I invited them somewhere they pretty much never **ever** replied. I texted them on October 19th about going out for a coffee and still got no reply as of today.

Its not the first time too, I tried twice before this year (back when they were still working and it was the same) but each time I saw them they didn't even act like anything happened.

So now I don't know if I should reach out again, to gently remind them or just leave them be and move on.

Apologies if the answer is staring me in the face and thank you for the insight :\]

(a confused girly)

## **Part 1: The Unmissable Icons - Your Rome Initiation**

You can't go to Rome without seeing these. They are the postcards, the movie scenes, the very heart of the city's identity. Our pro tips will help you experience them like a savvy traveler, not just a tourist.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**1. The Colosseum**
> Step inside the world's most famous amphitheater and imagine the roar of 50,000 spectators. The scale is simply staggering. This is the absolute pinnacle of things to do in Rome for any history lover.

*   **Pro Tip:** Book your tickets online **weeks in advance** from the [official CoopCulture site](https://www.coopculture.it/en) to skip the horrendous queue. For a truly special experience, book a ""Underground & Arena Floor"" tour.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**2. The Roman Forum & Palatine Hill**
> Your Colosseum ticket usually includes a two-day pass to these sprawling ruins. Walk the paths of emperors on Palatine Hill for the best panoramic view of the Forum, then wander down through the heart of ancient Roman political and social life.

*   **Pro Tip:** Go late in the afternoon. The golden hour light on the fallen columns is magical, and the crowds are much thinner.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**3. The Pantheon**
> A marvel of architectural engineering, this ancient temple's unreinforced concrete dome is still the world's largest. Stand under the oculus and watch the sunbeam illuminate the interior—it's a spiritual experience for many.

*   **Pro Tip:** Entry is now free but requires reservation through the [official website](https://pantheonrome.com/). Book your spot! Go early in the morning to enjoy the quiet atmosphere before the crowds arrive.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**4. Trevi Fountain**
> Toss a coin over your shoulder to ensure your return to Rome. This Baroque masterpiece is more spectacular than any photo can capture, especially when it's lit up at night.

*   **Pro Tip:** Visit at sunrise (around 6:30-7:00 AM in summer) for a mostly private, crowd-free view. It feels like you have the entire city to yourself.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**5. Spanish Steps (Piazza di Spagna)**
> A classic meeting place and a stunning example of Roman Baroque style. The climb is worth it for the view from the top, where you can also enjoy the Trinità dei Monti church.

*   **Pro Tip:** Avoid sitting on the steps—it's now forbidden to preserve the monument. Instead, grab a coffee or gelato from a nearby side street and people-watch.

## **Part 2: A City Within a City - Vatican City**

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

Prepare to be awestruck. Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state, but it packs a colossal artistic and spiritual punch.

**6. St. Peter's Basilica**
> The epicenter of the Catholic Church and a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture. It's free to enter, but be prepared for a security line. Michelangelo's _Pietà_ and Bernini's Baldacchino are just two of the countless treasures inside.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Pro Tip:** To climb to the top of the dome for that iconic view of St. Peter's Square, go to the dedicated entrance on the side of the basilica, not through the main entrance.

**7. St. Peter's Square**
> Designed by Bernini, this vast, elliptical piazza is meant to represent the ""maternal arms of the Church reaching out to embrace humanity.""

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Pro Tip:** On Wednesday mornings, if the Pope is in Rome, you can attend his weekly General Audience for a memorable (and free) cultural experience.

**8. The Vatican Museums**
> A labyrinth of jaw-dropping art collected by the popes over centuries. You could spend days here. Don't miss the Raphael Rooms, the Gallery of Maps, and, of course, the Sistine Chapel.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Pro Tip:** Book tickets online with a specific time slot. Seriously. The lines without a reservation can be 2-3 hours long. Consider a ""early access"" tour to see the Sistine Chapel with fewer people.

## **Part 3: Art, Culture & Hidden Gems**

Beyond the main sites, Rome is a city of incredible art and surprising quiet corners.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**9. Capitoline Museums**
> Sitting atop Capitoline Hill, this is the world's oldest public museum. It’s home to the iconic bronze statue of Marcus Aurelius and the breathtaking _Dying Gaul_.

*   **Pro Tip:** The views from the back terrace of the museum are arguably the best in Rome, looking directly over the Roman Forum.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**10. Galleria Borghese & Villa Borghese**
> You **must** book this museum weeks, if not months, in advance. It's a small, perfectly curated collection of Bernini and Caravaggio masterpieces in a stunning villa. Afterward, rent a rowboat on the park's lake or stroll through the beautiful gardens.

*   **Pro Tip:** Your ticket is for a strict 2-hour time slot, giving you a perfectly paced, uncrowded view of the art. Arrive 30 minutes early.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**11. The Mouth of Truth (Bocca della Verità)**
> Made famous by the movie _Roman Holiday_, test your honesty by putting your hand in the mouth of this ancient marble mask.

*   **Pro Tip:** It's located in the portico of the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. The line can be long, but it moves fast. Go while exploring the charming nearby Aventine Keyhole (see #27).

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**12. Palazzo Doria Pamphilj**
> A massive, private art collection still housed in its original princely palace. It feels like you've stumbled into a forgotten world of opulence. The portrait of Pope Innocent X by Velázquez alone is worth the price of admission.

*   **Pro Tip:** The included audio guide is narrated by a member of the family, adding a wonderfully personal touch.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**13. Quartiere Coppedè**
> A fantastical, brief detour from the main tourist trail. This tiny neighborhood is a whimsical mix of Art Nouveau, Baroque, and medieval styles. It feels like walking into a fairytale.

## **Part 4: Roman Food & Drink Adventures**

In Rome, eating is an art form. This is non-negotiable.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**14. Eat the Four Roman Pastas**
> You cannot leave without trying:
> *   **_Cacio e Pepe_**: Simple, perfect cheese and pepper.
> *   **_Carbonara_**: The real deal with guanciale, egg, and pecorino.
> *   **_Amatriciana_**: A tomato-based sauce with guanciale and pecorino.
> *   **_Gricia_**: The proto-carbonara, with guanciale and pecorino.

*   **Pro Tip:** Avoid restaurants with massive, picture-filled menus in English. Look for small _trattorie_ with handwritten menus, often called a _tavola calda_ for a quick, quality meal.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**15. Find the Best Gelato**
> Not all gelato is created equal. Avoid places with mounds of brightly colored gelato piled high (it's full of air and chemicals). Look for artisanal _gelaterias_ with natural-looking colors (pistachio should be a dull brownish-green) and metal tins (covered).

*   **Pro Tip:** Try unique flavors like _zucca_ (pumpkin), _fico d'india_ (prickly pear), or _ricotta e miele_ (ricotta and honey). Our top picks are Giolitti, Fatamorgana, and Come il Latte.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**16. Grab a Slice of Pizza al Taglio**
> ""Pizza by the cut."" This is the Roman lunch of champions. You point at the rectangular pizzas you want, they're weighed, and you pay. It's fast, delicious, and cheap.

*   **Pro Tip:** Try _ suppli_, a fried ball of rice with tomato sauce and mozzarella. It's the perfect sidekick to your pizza slice.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**17. Have an Aperitivo**
> Do as the Romans do and enjoy a pre-dinner drink. Go to a bar in the early evening (around 6-8 PM) and order an _Aperol Spritz_ or a _Negroni_. It often comes with a small spread of snacks.

*   **Pro Tip:** The neighborhoods of Trastevere and Monti are fantastic spots for a vibrant aperitivo scene.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**18. Sip a Coffee the Italian Way**
> Espresso is king. Order a _caffè_ for an espresso at the bar. A _caffè macchiato_ is an espresso ""stained"" with a bit of foam. A _cappuccino_ is strictly a morning drink. Ordering one after 11 PM is a dead giveaway you're a tourist!

*   **Pro Tip:** Stand at the bar with the locals. It's cheaper and more authentic than sitting at a table.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**19. Explore Campo de' Fiori Market**
> By day, it's a lively market selling fresh produce, flowers, and spices. By night, it transforms into a bustling hub for drinks and dining.

*   **Pro Tip:** Go in the morning to experience the market at its best. For dinner, steer away from the main square and find a restaurant in a quiet adjacent side street for better quality and prices.

## **Part 5: Charming Neighborhoods & Strolls**

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

Get lost. That's the best advice for Rome. But if you need a starting point, explore these incredible neighborhoods.

**20. Trastevere**
> Cross the Tiber River into this bohemian, ivy-clad neighborhood. Its narrow, cobbled lanes are perfect for wandering, especially in the evening when the ivy-covered buildings glow with warm light.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Pro Tip:** Discover the small, beautiful Church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere and check out its stunning last judgment fresco in the convent.

**21. Monti**
> Rome's ""hip"" neighborhood. It's a trendy mix of vintage shops, cool bars, and excellent restaurants, all set against the backdrop of the Roman Forum nearby. It's a great place to feel the city's modern pulse.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Pro Tip:** Grab a craft beer at one of the many _birrerie_ or find a hidden courtyard for a quiet drink.

**22. The Jewish Ghetto**
> One of Rome's most atmospheric and historic areas. The main street, Via del Portico d'Ottavia, is lined with fantastic restaurants specializing in Roman-Jewish cuisine (don't miss the _carciofi alla giudia_, fried artichokes).

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Pro Tip:** Visit the stunning, quieter synagogue and Jewish Museum for a deeper understanding of the neighborhood's long and complex history.

**23. Aventine Hill**
> For a peaceful escape with incredible views, come here. It's far less crowded than other hills.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Pro Tip:** Find the Priory of the Knights of Malta and peer through the keyhole of its green door. You'll see a perfectly framed view of St. Peter's Dome at the end of a garden path. It’s pure magic.

**24. Walk the Appian Way (Via Appia Antica)**
> The ""Queen of Roads,"" this ancient Roman highway is now a park. Rent a bike and cycle past ancient tombs and aqueducts under a canopy of trees. It feels a world away from the city.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Pro Tip:** The Catacombs of San Callisto are located here and offer a fascinating, if slightly eerie, look into early Christian burial practices.

## **Part 6: More Unique Experiences & Things to Do**

**25. Explore the Catacombs**
> Beyond the Appian Way, there are several catacombs accessible by metro. The Catacombs of Domitilla are particularly impressive.
**26. See Caravaggio's Masterpieces in Situ**

> Trevi is the most famous, but Rome has thousands of fountains. Find the ""talking statues"" and the charming Turtle Fountain in the Jewish Ghetto.
**28. Take a Cooking Class**
> Learn the secrets of pasta-making from a nonna. It's a fun, hands-on way to connect with the culture.
**29. Watch the Sunset from Pincian Hill**

**30. Visit an ""Estate Romana"" Event (in summer)**

**32. Marvel at the Ceiling of Sant'Ignazio di Loyola**
> A jaw-dropping example of trompe-l'œil (trick of the eye) painting. The flat ceiling looks like a soaring dome. Look for a special spot on the floor marked with a plaque where the illusion is perfect.
**33. Go Shopping on Via del Corso**
> Rome's main shopping street, perfect for some retail therapy, running from Piazza Venezia to Piazza del Popolo.
**34. Discover the Orange Garden (Giardino degli Aranci)**
> Also on the Aventine Hill, this park offers a panoramic view of the city and is a serene spot for a picnic.
**35. See the Pyramid of Cestius**
> An unexpected ancient Egyptian-style pyramid built as a tomb for a wealthy Roman, located near the Protestant Cemetery.
**36. Explore the Protestant Cemetery**
> A peaceful, beautiful oasis where poets John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley are buried.
**37. Eat Supplì**
> We mentioned it before, but it deserves its own point. This fried rice ball is a cornerstone of Roman street food.
**38. Visit Palazzo Valentini**
> Take an incredible multimedia tour where you walk over glass floors to see excavated Roman villas brought to life with light shows.
**39. Check out the EUR District**
> For a dose of fascist-era architecture, head to this district built for the 1942 World's Fair. It's a stark, fascinating contrast to ancient Rome.
**40. Walk through Piazza Navona at Night**
> With Bernini's magnificent Fountain of the Four Rivers as its centerpiece, this piazza is breathtaking when lit up and full of life.
**41. Indulge in Maritozzo**
> A classic Roman breakfast pastry—a sweet bun filled with a generous amount of whipped cream.
**42. See the Quirinal Palace**
*   The official residence of the President of the Italian Republic. Check for tour openings to see its opulent interiors.
**43. Take a Day Trip to Tivoli**

**44. Find the Keats-Shelley House**
*   Located right next to the Spanish Steps, this house museum is a must for literature lovers.
**45. Wander through Piazza del Popolo**
*   A massive, elegant piazza that serves as a grand entrance to the city. Climb the steps of the Pincian Hill from here for a great view.
**46. See a Gladiator Exhibition**
*   While you're at the Colosseum, check if there's a gladiator exhibition nearby for a deeper dive into their history.
**47. Explore the Baths of Caracalla**
*   The ruins of these ancient public baths give you an incredible sense of the scale of Roman life.
**48. Enjoy a Breathtaking View from Altare della Patria**
*   This massive ""wedding cake"" monument offers a panoramic (and slightly windy) terrace view for a small fee.
**49. Take a Food Tour**
*   A guided tour is the best way to ensure you hit the best spots for cacio e pepe, supplì, and gelato without the guesswork.
**50. Simply Get Lost**
*   Our final, most important tip. Turn off your map, pick a direction, and wander down a side street. This is how you'll find the quiet courtyards, tiny churches, and local bars that make Rome truly unforgettable.

So after I screwed up, not looking for sympathy but I tried getting a pltk if you know what I mean from Danao, if it wasn't clear. But it was over our agreed price and I wanted to leave a little something for my niece. Then several months later from end of March until July 2023 I was bed ridden, only went out of my room to go to the cr. Had mold grow on my food, didn't put that to waste, cry myself to sleep every other night. Went from 180 to 140,was  barely able stand on my own two feet for more than 5 minutes. Attempted leaving the station twice, once Robin Williams style (RIP Robin Williams). Got the help I needed at the mental unit, ever since then I just think about her and smile, FYI it hurts my face when I smile. In Part 1 I mentioned I took my first photos with her as a couple and those were basically the first photos where I was genuinely smiling from ear to ear. Next to the photos of me carrying my precious niece in my arms for the first time. I'll say it now my niece's and the rest of my family are a God send, if it weren't for them, not to be oa but I honestly don't think I'd be alive right now if it wasn't for them. It's not just how crappy I feel after losing the love of my life is the fact that I've been an embarrassment, failure, loser to my family for so long. Only recently have I started to improve. But you guys and God are my Sanctuary my saving grace, so I'll do whatever I can to make you guys proud. Although I wake up thinking she's laying there next to me in my arms or that sometimes I imagine us cuddling up to some k-drama. I know that's not the case but it's a comforting but sad thought. Still longing to feel her warm embrace, to feel like I'm back home again, to feel her dainty, gentle fingers but strong hands intertwined with mines again. To see my world in her eyes again to finally make it a reality. That lively and quirky smile and bright twinkling eyes that light up the night sky. I don't need no stars above when I know I can just look or in this case imagine the look in her eyes when she looks back at me. We started dating October 10, 2021 if I kept my promise to her and all things went well, by October 10, 2025 I would've proposed to her. I know this cause I tried to move on. Last year I met a girl online we dated for almost 5 months, talked about marriage, kids, a family. Ever since I was a kid I dreamt about what my wedding would be like, what it would be like to be a father. Thinking about it more these days cause my younger cousin just got married last week, btw congratulations cuz wish you both the best! So this girl I was having these serious conversations with, she sent me a picture of the ring she wants, she gave her ring size with not much trouble (told her I want to get matching couple rings). Then cause of a mistake I made in the first month of the relationship she decided not to accept the ring (I got the engagement ring she wanted as a promise ring). I was also this girl's first romantic interest to give her flowers, got her family a 15-20 kg pig for lechon for Christmas which they haven't had in 2 years. I talk to her mom every now and then, even learned a little bit of her mom's language. Then I met a delightful girl here in Cebu, from reddit we had 2 dates got along, but came to an understanding that were not ready for a relationship and would like to not be exclusive. Eventually we kinda caught feelings for each other. Then eventually I met someone online, I told her thinking she would be happy for me, which she was but now cause of that, we're not on speaking terms. Right now I'm tired of all the games. I'm in a better place now though, currently learning 2 languages, learning an instrument, planning to compete in multiple sports this year, goals of making the national team in 2 sports, learning cryptography, learning how to sing and dance, teaching judo, trying to teach English online and or work at a call center or something amongst other things. If you know this girl it would be greatly appreciated if you can bring this message to her attention. Her nickname is the same as this powdered candy that rhymes with pik nik, her initials AA the only AA I need, she graduated BEED I think in June 2025 from university of Cebu. Tomboy but knows how to dress yo the nines, skincare routine typically is instant coffee and or honey from what I can remember, is from Buanoy, has 4 other siblings, 2 of them has kids, one is my age and she has a younger brother. She likes to joke around, but serious when she needs to be, has her own language but I don't entirely remember, probably could still decipher it though. Likes pop, k-pop, r&b, reggae, African music don't know the genre, dance hall I guess, again I'm not sure of the genre, Rap, opm, obm, hip hop, I'm sure other things as well. Her tik tok videos had songs like someone you loved, trevor Daniel falling, Ali Gatie it's you, doja cat like that, Ariana grande 34+35, PsychedelicBoyz batang pasaway, skusta Clee susunod na lang, Cookies Bisdako, RKteQ Bisaya, na-unsa diay ka, Soulthrll cutie uyyy, miguel sure thing, Justin Bieber yummy, sza the weekend, Semme do Dat and other songs. Her bias when we first started dating was J Hope, then midway through Jungkook and before we broke up it was Suga. She's into K drama, but also C drama and Thai drama shows I think. Her favourite foods according to her mother cause for some reason she didn't want to tell me, is bam-i, spaghetti I think, paklay and their was something else but that's all I can remember for now. She also really likes buwad, she actually got me yo like it enough to be ok with eating it when it's around, when growing up I avoid it like the plague. She a thick girl but she's athletic, playful, absolutely amazing with kids, stern and religious but doesn't shove it down your throat. She's a flirt and I think not on purpose just like me, both our parents separated from their partners in the same year I believe, basically for the same reason too, I believe she also deals with depression as well. She loves coffee, I love coffee and I can make a mean Vietnamese coffee thinking of starting my own café one day. Her name is similar to the title of this sitcom from 1986-1990 about an alien and his life with your typical suburban family. Her name is a combination of her parents name. Her Mom's birthday is September 13th, they both do the same job basically just different aspects or roles.

## What Exactly *Is* Secret Santa?

For the uninitiated, **Secret Santa** (also known as Kris Kringle) is a Christmas gift exchange where a group of people are randomly assigned a person to whom they give a gift. The key is the *secret* part—you don't reveal who you're buying for until the big exchange. It adds a layer of mystery and fun to the holiday season, especially in large groups like an **office Secret Santa** or a big family.

## How to Play Secret Santa: The Unbreakable Rules

Setting clear rules from the start is the secret to a successful **gift exchange**. Follow this simple checklist to get it right.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=secret%20santa)

1.  **Set the Date and Budget:** This is step one. Decide on a date for the exchange and agree on a strict price limit. A typical budget ranges from $15 to $30. Having a clear budget ensures everyone feels comfortable and no one feels pressured to overspend.

2.  **Draw Names (The ""Secret"" Part):** This is where the magic happens! Each participant draws a name randomly from a hat or, more efficiently, a **Secret Santa generator**. Online tools like `Elfster` or `DrawNames` are amazing because they automatically handle the drawing, keep assignments secret, and let people create wishlists.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=secret%20santa)

3.  **Create a Wishlist (Crucial Step!):** This is the single best way to prevent the ""regifted candle from last year"" situation. Encourage everyone to add 3-5 gift ideas to their wishlist. This takes the guesswork out of shopping and ensures your recipient gets something they actually want. It's not a guarantee; it's a guide!

4.  **The Gift Exchange Event:** On the designated day, everyone brings their wrapped, labeled gift. You can have everyone open their gift one by one and try to guess who their **Secret Santa** was, which is always a source of great laughter and conversation.

## Pro-Tips for a Flawless Secret Santa

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=secret%20santa)

Ready to level up your gift exchange game?

*   **Use an Online Organizer:** Seriously, just use a **Secret Santa generator**. It solves so many problems: no one can draw their own name, it keeps things private, and it centralizes wishlists and deadlines.
*   **Emphasize the Wishlist:** When you announce the exchange, make the wishlist a mandatory part of the process. A simple email like, ""Don't forget to add your top 3-5 gift ideas to our Elfster page by Friday!"" makes a huge difference.
*   **Set a Clear Deadline:** Set a deadline for both name-drawing and gift submission. For example, ""Names will be drawn on Dec 1st, and the exchange will be at our holiday party on Dec 20th.""
*   **What if Someone Drops Out?** Have a plan. Usually, the organizer has to step in and buy a gift for the person left behind. Using an online tool helps track participation and gives you an early heads-up.

## Common Secret Santa Questions (Answered!)

**Q: What's a good Secret Santa budget?**
**A:** The sweet spot for an **office Secret Santa** is usually between $20 and $30. For close friends or family, it could be $50 or more. The key is that everyone agrees on it beforehand.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=secret%20santa)

**Q: When should you do a Secret Santa gift exchange?**
**A:** The ideal time is at a holiday party in early to mid-December. This gives everyone enough time to shop after they've drawn names but ensures the festive spirit is in full swing.

**Q: What if I get someone I don't know well?**
**A:** This is where the wishlist is your best friend! If there isn't one, do some subtle detective work. Check their social media (if appropriate) or ask a mutual friend about their hobbies. When in doubt, go for a universally appreciated ""consumable"" gift like good coffee, a nice bottle of wine, or gourmet snacks.

I've been interested in this species for obvious reasons like WHAT?! Our own native coffee species, that's INSANE. 

Now, I am aware there are dozens of coffea species and only a handful have been demonstrated to contain caffeine, and even less have much cultivation and consumption potential. But there are probably more out there to be discovered. 

So the history of the Brassii is a bit complicated, you'll read different accounts and it started off with the nomenclature Psilanthus brassii. It was probably noted on some of the later Continental expidetions and seems to have been rediscovered a few times but it's been known to modern science since the early 2000's.  

Anyway, one article I read from around 2010 was discussing how we knew little about it, and we didn't know if it contains caffeine. Okay great, but it's been 15 years and I'm just like wtf, what do you mean we still don't know if it contains caffeine!? That's not even a difficult test, I mean c'mon science. 

I've searched Google scholar and there's some analysis of leaf and genetic material, but I just don't understand why no one has thrown a bean in an NMR spectroscopy machine ?? Like you don't even have to do that to determine caffeine you can literally buy of the shelf caffeine analysis machines (coffee nerds do it all the time). 

So, this has either been a huge let down of the collective coffee and scientific community, or I am missing something. Does anyone know what's going on here?

1oomx4m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oomx4m,Starlight lipstick review,"Having learned about the brand on this sub and seeing others express curiosity also I decided to give it a try and see how it compares. I’m all but done with Besame (their lipstick formula is so good but that’s really all the praise I can give them at the moment) and almost out of my Red Hot Red so I decided to try it.

Starlight is a Canadian brand but my package actually shipped from NY so there were no tariffs. The refillable tube was $33 and shipping was $10. I ordered it 10/20, it shipped 10/26, and I received it 11/2. 

First picture: contents of bubble mailer. I loved that their “thank you for your purchase” note looks like a postcard. A little strange that there was no packing slip but the velvet pouch is a nice touch. 

Second picture: Starlight vs. Besame packaging. I actually could not find the quantity of either lipstick but at a glance I assume the actual lipstick content is similar. The Starlight tube is slightly taller/skinnier but weighs about as much as 3-4 Besame tubes. Both are vanilla scented/flavored but the Besame one is much stronger so, do with that info what you will. 

Third picture: swatches!
Top: Besame Victory Red
Middle: Starlight A Salute In Red
Bottom: Besame Red Hot Red

I expected Salute to be a Victory dupe but I don’t think it is. Victory Red is a little cooler and a little darker, and the Starlight lipstick has a slightly more “slick” finish and feel.

Fourth picture: wear test! Applied 7AM. Regardless of historical accuracy I have always hated the shape of Besame’s bullets so I much preferred the rounded Starlight one. 

Fifth picture: 5 hours later post snack it was bleeding juuuuuuust the tiniest bit around the edges. Unless I’m eating something particularly sloppy I just leave my lipstick on and this stood up coffee and cookies rather well. 

Sixth and seventh picture: what it looked like by 5PM, and what it looked like after wiping it off. I actually like how much Besame stains, and Starlight really doesn’t but, preferences. 

Anywho, do I think it’s just as good or a dupe, no, but for almost half the price (Starlight refills are $19) I will probably shift in the direction of using this one more. I’m personally hoping they release a warmer red but all in all, I like it. ",14,1762298766.0,BesameCosmetics,2,0.95,False
1oomvgg,https://i.redd.it/pu1lim5eqbzf1.jpeg,How AI Will Change the Way Agents Write Property Descriptions So Their Listings Show in AI Searches,"# 

The real estate industry is on the brink of a fundamental shift in how buyers discover properties. While agents have spent years mastering SEO for traditional search engines like Google and optimizing listings for portals like Zillow and [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com), a new player has entered the game: AI-powered search.

With tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews becoming the go-to research assistants for millions of consumers, the rules for writing property descriptions are changing rapidly. Understanding how to write for both traditional platforms and AI searches isn't just an advantage anymore—it's becoming essential for getting your listings seen.

# The Fundamental Shift: From Keywords to Context

Traditional SEO relied heavily on keyword stuffing and optimization formulas. You'd pepper your listing with terms like ""granite countertops,"" ""hardwood floors,"" and ""open concept"" to rank higher in searches. While these tactics still matter for real estate portals, AI search works fundamentally differently.

**AI search engines understand context, intent, and natural language.** Instead of searching for ""3 bedroom house granite countertops,"" buyers now ask conversational questions like: ""Find me a family-friendly home near good schools with a backyard for under $400,000 in Austin.""

This means your property descriptions need to tell a complete, contextual story rather than simply listing features.

# Why This Matters Now

Recent studies show that over 30% of younger homebuyers are using AI chatbots to research home purchases, and that number is growing monthly. These AI tools don't just regurgitate search results—they synthesize information, compare properties, and make recommendations based on nuanced criteria.

If your listing descriptions aren't written in a way that AI can understand and contextualize, your properties simply won't appear in these conversations. You'll be invisible to an increasingly significant segment of potential buyers.

# How AI Reads Property Descriptions Differently

# Traditional Search Engines Look For:

* Specific keywords and phrases
* Meta descriptions and tags
* Backlinks and domain authority
* Exact matches to search queries

# AI Search Tools Look For:

* Complete context and narrative flow
* Detailed, specific information
* Comparative advantages
* Emotional and lifestyle elements
* Answers to implicit questions
* Factual accuracy and consistency
* Natural language and readability

Understanding these differences is crucial for crafting descriptions that work in both ecosystems.

# The Step-by-Step Guide to Writing AI-Optimized Property Descriptions

# Step 1: Start with the Complete Context

**Traditional approach:** ""Beautiful 3BR/2BA home with granite countertops and hardwood floors.""

**AI-optimized approach:** ""This welcoming 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom single-family home in the heart of West Austin's Tarrytown neighborhood offers 1,850 square feet of thoughtfully updated living space, perfect for families seeking walkability to top-rated schools and local parks.""

**Why it works:** AI can immediately understand the property type, exact location, size, target buyer, and key lifestyle benefits. It provides context that helps AI match the property to specific buyer queries.

# Step 2: Answer the Questions Buyers Actually Ask

Think about the questions your target buyers ask during showings, then answer them proactively in your description.

**Common buyer questions to address:**

* What's the neighborhood really like?
* How's the commute to downtown?
* Are the schools good?
* What's been updated recently?
* Why is the seller moving?
* What are the utility costs like?
* Is there good storage?
* What's included in the sale?

**Example integration:** ""The home sits on a quiet, tree-lined street where neighbors know each other by name, just a 15-minute drive to downtown tech offices and within the highly sought-after Casis Elementary school boundary. Recent updates include a new HVAC system (2023), roof (2022), and complete kitchen renovation (2024), meaning you can move in worry-free.""

# Step 3: Be Specific with Numbers and Details

AI thrives on specificity. Vague descriptions are harder for AI to categorize and compare.

**Instead of:** ""Spacious master bedroom"" **Write:** ""The 16x14-foot master bedroom easily accommodates a king-sized bed and includes a walk-in closet with custom built-in organizers""

**Instead of:** ""Large backyard"" **Write:** ""The fully-fenced 0.25-acre backyard features mature oak trees, a covered patio, and enough space for a pool addition""

**Instead of:** ""Recently updated kitchen"" **Write:** ""The kitchen was completely renovated in 2024 with quartz countertops, soft-close shaker cabinets, stainless steel Samsung appliances, and a farmhouse sink""

# Step 4: Use Natural, Conversational Language

Write like you're telling a friend about the property, not filling out a form.

**Avoid:** ""Property features include granite, SS appliances, HW floors"" **Instead:** ""You'll love cooking in the bright kitchen with its granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and beautiful hardwood floors that flow throughout the main living areas""

AI is trained on natural human language. The more your description sounds like how people actually talk, the better AI can process and recommend it.

# Step 5: Create Clear Sections with Descriptive Headers

Structure your description logically so both humans and AI can quickly find relevant information.

**Recommended structure:**

**Overview & Location** Start with the big picture—property type, size, location, and who it's perfect for.

**Main Living Spaces** Describe the layout, flow, and key features of common areas.

**Bedrooms & Bathrooms** Provide specific details about each space.

**Outdoor Spaces** Describe the yard, patio, views, or other exterior features.

**Updates & Systems** List recent renovations, new systems, and warranty information.

**Neighborhood & Lifestyle** Paint a picture of daily life—nearby amenities, commute times, community feel.

**Investment Highlights** Include tax information, HOA details, and any financial benefits.

# Step 6: Incorporate Lifestyle and Emotional Elements

AI is increasingly sophisticated at understanding lifestyle matching. Help it connect your property to buyer aspirations.

**Examples:**

""Imagine Saturday mornings walking to the farmer's market three blocks away, then hosting friends for dinner on your covered back porch as the sun sets over the hill country views.""

""Work-from-home professionals will appreciate the dedicated home office with built-in desk and bookshelves, separate from the main living areas for privacy during video calls.""

""This home is designed for the way modern families actually live—mudroom entry from the garage for easy unloading, open kitchen overlooking the family room so you can cook while helping with homework, and upstairs laundry between all the bedrooms.""

# Step 7: Include Comparison Points

Help AI understand how your property stacks up against alternatives.

**Examples:**

""Unlike most homes in this price range, this property includes a two-car garage plus additional driveway parking for four vehicles—a rare find in this walkable neighborhood.""

""The 2,200 square feet offers significantly more space than typical townhomes in the area, which average 1,600 square feet, while maintaining the low-maintenance lifestyle.""

""This home provides single-family space and privacy at a price point typically reserved for condos in this neighborhood.""

# Step 8: Front-Load Critical Information

While you want to tell a complete story, make sure the most important details appear early. Both AI and human readers should grasp the essentials within the first 2-3 sentences.

**Effective opening:** ""This meticulously maintained 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom Craftsman-style home at 2847 Maple Street offers 2,400 square feet of light-filled living space in highly desirable Roosevelt High School district. Built in 2015 and lovingly cared for by its original owners, the home features an open floor plan, chef's kitchen with professional-grade appliances, and oversized corner lot with mature landscaping—all priced at $575,000.""

This opening gives AI (and buyers) immediate clarity on size, location, condition, age, key features, and price.

# Step 9: Avoid Jargon and Abbreviations

While real estate professionals understand ""SS appliances,"" ""HW floors,"" and ""WIC,"" AI may not always interpret these correctly, and buyers certainly won't.

**Replace abbreviations:**

* SS → stainless steel
* HW → hardwood
* WIC → walk-in closet
* WBFP → wood-burning fireplace
* A/C → air conditioning
* HOA → homeowners association (spell it out first, then abbreviate)

# Step 10: Include Factual, Verifiable Details

AI prioritizes accuracy and can cross-reference information. Include verifiable facts that build credibility.

**Include when known:**

* School names and ratings
* Exact distances to landmarks (""0.8 miles to Central Park"")
* Public transportation access (""200 yards to Metro station"")
* Specific renovation years
* Energy efficiency ratings
* Square footage breakdowns
* Lot size
* Year built
* Tax amounts
* HOA fees

# Step 11: Optimize for Both Platforms

The good news? What works for AI also works for real estate portals and traditional search. The key is balancing both approaches.

**For Real Estate Portals:**

* Use their structured fields completely (don't skip any)
* Include all relevant features in checkboxes
* Upload high-quality photos with descriptive file names
* Complete every optional field offered

**For AI Search:**

* Write the narrative description thoughtfully
* Use natural language
* Provide context and storytelling
* Answer anticipated questions

**For Both:**

* Be accurate and specific
* Update information promptly
* Maintain consistency across all fields
* Use proper grammar and spelling

# Step 12: Test and Refine Your Descriptions

After writing your description, test it by asking AI tools questions about the property.

**Try asking:**

* ""Find me homes with home offices near good elementary schools in \[city\]""
* ""What properties under $500K have been recently renovated?""
* ""Show me family-friendly homes with big backyards""

If your listing doesn't appear in relevant results, refine your description to include more contextual details about those features.

# A Complete Example: Before and After

# Before (Traditional Listing):

""3BR/2BA home. Granite counters, SS appliances, HW floors. New roof. Great location. Move-in ready. $425K.""

# After (AI-Optimized):

""This inviting 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home at 456 Oak Avenue in the heart of Riverside's family-friendly Brookside neighborhood offers 1,650 square feet of move-in ready living space for $425,000. Perfect for first-time homebuyers or young families, the home sits on a quiet street within walking distance of Brookside Elementary (rated 9/10) and just two blocks from Riverside Park's playground and walking trails.

Inside, the open-concept main floor welcomes you with beautiful refinished oak hardwood floors flowing through the living and dining areas. The updated kitchen features granite countertops, stainless steel appliances (all included), plenty of cabinet storage, and a sunny breakfast nook overlooking the backyard.

The three bedrooms upstairs include a spacious master with an ensuite bathroom, while two additional well-sized bedrooms share a updated hall bathroom with new vanity and fixtures. An upstairs laundry closet adds convenience to your daily routine.

Outside, the fully-fenced backyard offers a safe play space for children or pets, a garden area, and a storage shed. The property also includes a one-car detached garage with additional storage space.

Recent updates include a new architectural shingle roof (2023), fresh interior paint throughout (2024), and updated bathroom fixtures. The forced-air gas heating and central air conditioning systems are well-maintained and efficient.

Located just 20 minutes from downtown via Highway 50, this neighborhood offers the perfect blend of suburban tranquility and urban convenience, with local coffee shops, restaurants, and grocery stores within a five-minute drive.""

**What makes the AI-optimized version work:**

* Specific location and context (street name, neighborhood)
* Target buyer identification (first-time buyers, families)
* Nearby amenities with distances (school, park)
* Specific measurements and details
* Natural, conversational language
* Updated systems with years
* Lifestyle elements (commute time, nearby shops)
* Complete answers to likely questions

# The Future is Conversational

As AI search continues to evolve, property descriptions will need to become even more contextual and conversational. The agents who adapt now—learning to write descriptions that work for both traditional portals and AI searches—will have a significant competitive advantage.

The best part? Writing for AI doesn't mean abandoning what works for traditional search. It simply means being more thorough, more specific, and more human in your descriptions. It means telling the complete story of a property in a way that helps both algorithms and actual people understand why it might be the perfect home for someone.

# Key Takeaways

1. **Be specific:** Replace vague descriptions with exact measurements, dates, and details
2. **Write naturally:** Use conversational language that sounds human, not robotic
3. **Provide context:** Explain location, neighborhood, and lifestyle elements
4. **Answer questions:** Address the concerns and queries buyers typically have
5. **Structure logically:** Organize information so it's easy to scan and understand
6. **Include comparisons:** Help AI understand your property's unique advantages
7. **Stay factual:** Accuracy builds trust with both AI and buyers
8. **Think like a buyer:** Write from the perspective of someone discovering your listing for the first time
9. **Test your work:** Use AI tools to verify your listings appear in relevant searches
10. **Keep evolving:** AI search is constantly improving; stay informed about best practices

The agents who master AI-optimized property descriptions today will be the ones whose listings get discovered, shared, and seriously considered by tomorrow's buyers. The future of real estate marketing isn't just about great photos anymore—it's about telling compelling, complete, contextual stories that both humans and AI can understand and act upon.

Start rewriting your next listing with these principles in mind, and watch how much more engagement your properties receive.

Driving isn't an issue for me incase a quick coffee meet-up was planned. I'm a huge fan of museums & history and I adore a good coffee (if it wasn't already obvious). Love chess, exercise, nature, music and the like.

Deep conversations are my specialty. I'm big on psychology and sociology, and politics isn't off the question (green 💚)

1oomqo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/newredditors/comments/1oomqo6/the_story_of_how_diablos_slave_came_to_be/,The Story of How Diablo’s Slave Came to Be,"I needed to buy my girlfriend something new, something aromatic for her feet. 

I walked outside in the hot Arkansas sun.  It was still warm despite winter seeping into November.  We’d come to Hot Springs, well, because I was too shy to tell her I am into each one of her little nubby toes.  That this seemed the easiest place to admire the beauty of her goddess feet in the little leather thonged sandals she made herself.  

She’s a queen. She’s magic. I see the stars in her eyes.  

I  walked into one of those new age inspirational shops and settled on buying sandalwood massage oil and a pink morganite stone that said it was for divine love, but I put it back once I found the most divine smelling perfume oil … that came tied to a tiny pink candle.

I pictured rolling that little pink candle between each and every one of her little piggies.  I was sold.  I’d get three.

The bottle read Cobra. I uncorked it and I was awash with euphoria.  I imagined my tongue between each and every…… then I blacked out.  I flung everything of the shelf, all the crystals flying everywhere and I felt I was swallowed by The Void.  It felt like ice ran through my veins.  It sucked. 

That’s when I awoke.

The tarot reader in the back room was standing over me offering me water and a ginger candy and asking if I was ok.  

I’d hit my head. 

That’s when I saw her feet - the way they looked in those purple satin lace up sandals. 

“You are now an angel that fell back down to Earth, “ she giggled and her toes curled releasing little damp spots near my nose where her tootsie’s were.

That’s the day I moved to Hot Springs, Arkansas.  I went to a realtor and bought a house and run a boutique from the cottage.  My gf and I run our feminist fair trade toe ring boutique and have a spiritual menstrual circle slash coffee shop.  It’s called Diablo’s Slave. ",1,1762298327.0,newredditors,0,1.0,False

Histórias sobre criaturas misteriosas, ruídos estranhos parecidos com passos, gritos estranhos, sons de ""psiu"", barulhos de luzes quebradas, entre muitos outros fenômenos de procedências duvidosa e misteriosa. Muitas pessoas também relataram pessoas que entraram no hotel e nunca mais foram vistas: Blake Anders, Dexter Hoffman, Jane Patrick, Vanessa John, Sandra Dylan. Pedi para meu informante da polícia, Marcus Kent, checar a veracidade desses desaparecimentos, todos confirmados, todos desaparecidos e sem investigação efetiva.

Voltando ao foco, me levanto e vou checar, abrindo a janela e deixando o frio invadir o apartamento.

I started a new job this past June after being laid off from my last job in April.

The job itself is fine. Not technical or overly challenging, just tedious. The problem is that I’m experiencing massive anxiety about work pretty much whenever I’m not there. I go to work dreading the day, I leave work dreading tomorrow, but when I’m actually at work, I’m generally fine. It keeps me up at night, I often feel sick to my stomach, and when I think about it too long my heart starts racing.

I’ve spoken to my therapist about this, and she says that neurodivergent people often struggle in office environments. However, while my last position was in academia, I’ve been in corporate roles before and haven’t had the same problem. She also said being overqualified (which I admittedly am) can also cause anxiety and stress. She also mentioned that trying stimulants again will likely help. I started new meds for my depression and anxiety about a month ago, and will be getting medication for my ADHD soon, but I don’t want to rely on medication to “fix” the problem.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make going to work less anxiety inducing? I know it sounds dumb, but I’ve thought about trying to condition myself through positive reinforcement (like with coffee, etc.), but I’m looking for other ideas as well.
