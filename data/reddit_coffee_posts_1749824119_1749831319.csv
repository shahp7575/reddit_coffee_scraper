1lajwjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/navimumbai/comments/1lajwjj/first_weekend_in_mumbai/,First weekend in Mumbai,"Hello everyone

I’ve recently moved to Mumbai (staying in Andheri) for a summer internship. It’s my first time living in a city where I don’t really know anyone, and with the weekend coming up, I figured I’d reach out here.

Most of my college friends who were in Mumbai have moved out after graduation, and while the folks at my internship are great, it’s a small setup and most of them have families, so they’re understandably busy on weekends.

I love the energy around here in this city and I feel that it would be a shame if i dont make the most out of my time here. I love to talk about investments, entrepreneurship, books, tv/movies ,etc .

If anyone else is in a similar boat — new to the city or not, looking to explore, grab a coffee, or just hang out — I’d love to connect! I also hit the gym every morning around 6:30 AM, so if you're into that and want a workout buddy, even better.




Drop me a message or comment if you’re around 🙂 Would be nice to make some  friends here to hangout with. ",1,1749831071.0,navimumbai,0,1.0,False

1lajwfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1lajwfo/my_husband_is_on_a_welldeserved_break/,My husband is on a well-deserved break,"I worked with my stepson to get my husband out for a few days. We’ve planned it for months, and they are currently in a cabin, miles from home, fishing and having a good time. He and I care for his parents together, but he tends to take more of the hands-on care because he feels like they are more his responsibility. I help with more on the backend (laundry, meals, cleaning) and some hands-on if he needs help or if I am with them solo. It’s a team effort and outside of paying someone to check on them and clean their home a few days a week during the times we cannot cover due to work (next door to us; they require a lot of care but still manageable with them in their own space so close).
Hubby was hesitant because he really wants time with us together as that is very limited. We have had one vacation together- our honeymoon over 10 years ago. I was hesitant and anxious (kept it from him though) because doing this all on my own was a bit overwhelming. He’s done it a day or 2 at a time when I’ve went for overnight things for our younger kids, but this is 4 days and nights. 

He left yesterday. FaceTimed from the edge of the river, fishing pole in hand. Big grin on his face. He FaceTimed from bed last night, checking in, and he looked more relaxed than I’ve seen him lol in years. He texted this morning, at 9, he had just got up and was enjoying his coffee. And I am so overjoyed that he is getting this time to recharge and reset. I am thankful he did not back out (because he wanted to) and is taking this time for himself. I miss him like crazy because he’s the other half of me but he deserves and needs this time. That look of calm on his face makes everything worth it.

1lajw2v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lajw2v,RAMS SB MVP Cooper Kupp’s DODO Coffee Recommendation,"Hi.  I know Cooper Kupp is a Seachicken now, but I ordered some of his DODO 🦤 Coffee a few weeks ago in a fit of impulse buying. 

I also know this isn’t football related, but it’s the off season and I want people to drink good coffee.

But this coffee (Zacapa) is really complex with outstanding flavor while not being overly roasted like many coffees are.

I bought and received the coffee last month , but I just was able to put it in my bean grinding hopper.

The packaging is really outstanding, but probably adds to the cost of the beans, because it’s such expensive looking packaging which is another con of this coffee.  It’s pricey. 

But I tried the Zacapa blend and it was excellent.  I also bought the Dodo 🦤 blend, and I look forward to it.

She didn't show her full face, and honestly, I thought it might be catfish vibes at first. Said she was married, but her marriage had been dead for years. He was much older, some big company director, and she'd been pushed into marriage too young. She got married when was just 22. They were just existing, not living

Still, there was something about her..even behind the blurred snaps and hidden angles. She ran her own salons, sharp and confident, with this magnetic way of speaking.I used to find her independent women behavior very hot. Eventually we moved to Snapchat. She wouldn't show her face, but the connection?? Real as hell..

We called, sometimes video chatted (still no face), and had this perfect unspoken rhythm. No pressure. No clinginess. Just texts, voice notes, and yes... things used to go hot. We shared pics (faceless), flirted, teased, sxted. Her curves??? Unreal... Thick, mm-body energy, hourglass perfection. But more than that..she got me

She used to talk about riding with me to a faraway coffee shop on my bike, wind in her hair. She used to say ""we won't meet"".. but I could tell that was changing. We both felt it shifting and talked about dating soon

And then - nothing... literally nothing

One night we laughed and talked for hours. Next morning? Account gone. Not blocked. Just... deleted. Disappeared. Like she never existed. It's been 6 months since then

Those 5 months made me feel seen. Desired. Connected. She said it kept her sane too. But I guess something changed, or maybe life caught up

I still think of her sometimes.. those voice notes, those flirty mornings, her laugh. I miss that

No anger, just a strange kind of ache. I hope she's okay

Anyone else can relate ??

TL;DR:- Had a 5-month deep online connection with a 40F while I'm 28M. She was married but emotionally checked out. We bonded, flirted, s*xted, connected deeply.

Started a pop up cafe and shop in an unused farm building on my land with friend. She's very gung ho and was keen to be involved as I was not in a position to run it on my own and I decided to offer her 50/50 split of any profits that we made after we had covered any running costs. My family own it but the building was a shell and needed a fair bit of work to get it up and running. I own the bones of the cafe - the coffee machine, cooking facilities but she bought the ""nice"" stuff - cups, plates, utensils etc (which I was happy to source from charity shops and home etc, but she wanted to all to be the same and say it doesn't matter as they are physical things and she can use them if the cafe didn't work). We also did a lot of the work ourselves, tiling, woodwork, plumbing to get it going. it was a lot of work. We both did it together.

  
We didn't make any formal agreement, no partnership agreement, nothing on paper as we never expected it to turn into anything. We didn't even have a rental agreement either as we were getting the property for free from my family for any work done to the property for six months.

Was intended to just be a short term Christmas pop up for the xmas period but turned out to be very popular and we decided to run with it for a while to see if we could make some money. Which we did, it turned out to be amazing and very successful and we were starting to make some money and it was turning into a full time job. 

This is when it got messy.  
We had a row over something minor that totally blew up and she went a bit mental and started ripping out all the stuff that she had put in making the space unuseable and the cafe has had to close. She is now claiming that I owe her money and she is demanding that I give her half of all the sales etc in the shop even when there are current outstanding bills of electricity that have not been paid yet. She is also demanding to have access to the till reports and all the accounting system. It is in my name and is my account and all monies made were going into my bank account and then I paid her 50% of any profit made after costs. She did have access but I have changed the passwords now to prevent her access and from going in a changing/wiping anything. 

I don't want to close the cafe as it was working but she is saying that I can't use the name and the social media accounts of which I created.

Where do I stand here? Can I just tell her to bugger off or does she have any grounds for taking me to claims court like she is threatening?

It wasn’t on any map. It appeared only to those who shouldn’t have met.

Nestled between two buildings that hadn’t existed yesterday, under the flicker of a glitching neon sign reading “The Last Door Café — Open to the Impossible,” a storm roared outside, but the air inside was thick with stranger things.

Snape sat at a corner table, swirling tea as if stirring secrets.
Chandler Bing glanced around nervously. “So this is what it’s like being inside a fanfiction,” he muttered.

In a shadowed booth, Batman observed silently while Gojo Satoru floated a spoon midair, simply because he could.

At the counter, Walter White and Sheldon Cooper debated whether magic was just misunderstood science — loudly enough to irritate Arya Stark, who flicked a dagger in her hand with controlled menace.

Obito sat with a black coffee that showed flickering images of his past instead of a reflection.
Ryuzaki, hunched over a napkin, scribbled silently while keeping eyes on Harvey Specter, who returned the stare with the calm of a man who always wins his case.

Near the fogged-up window, Jon Snow stood, snowflakes dusting his shoulders, though it was warm inside. He stared at someone across the room he couldn’t quite place, but felt like he’d known forever.

Rowley Jefferson clutched his diary and whispered to Perry the Platypus,
“Do you understand anything going on here?”

Perry adjusted his fedora, sipped his espresso without blinking.

And then—
The bell above the door rang.

In walked The Penguin from Madagascar, trench coat soaked, eyes sharp.

He dropped a file on the table.

“Mission Briefing: One of you causes the collapse of all realities in exactly nine minutes,” he announced.

Silence.

“Clues are hidden in your drinks,” he added. “And one of you… is not who you appear to be.”

Gojo smirked.
“This is my kind of date night.”

Chandler blinked.
“Wait—was that a date offer? Because I’m in. Unless you’re the villain. Then I’m still kinda in.”

The café clock began ticking louder. Each tick echoing into infinity.

Everyone looked around.

And then, Jon Snow turned toward Arya and whispered,
“I’ve seen this place in a dream. But you weren’t you.”

Her dagger disappeared.

She leaned in and replied,
“That’s because I’m not.”

The lights dimmed.

I love my time with Kitten the most when she is like she was this morning: transparent, open, stream-of-consciousness, vulnerable--and talking a mile a minute. 

She is not used to living out of a suitcase like I am. A move for her is a big deal. She is now officially outside of Jammy. She has two gigs today, the final restaurant Early Bird Special where she is going to say goodbye to her senior friends who come almost every single Friday to the restaurant. Then tonight is her first time to play a classical piece on the stage in front of a large audience. She is so excited about both. I think I need a strong string tied around her ankle to keep her from flying off into the air like a balloon. 

We are going to pack this weekend. Kitten has today and Monday for class. Her US History Regents is on Friday morning. The Big Four and I will pick her up after the test and head out to the RV Park. Maybe we'll do it in one day, perhaps two, and spend the night and eat at Who-Knows-Where.

Monday will also be my final day of modeling. I do enjoy the work and the Maximo people. I will miss it and the money; I just know that it is not my life calling. I also set up some dance, singing, and physical conditioning classes for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I want to put together routines for while I am away. I am sad that we will miss our discussion meeting again.

When we went to the Future Division Soka Family Day meeting I picked up a newly published book of collected guidances Sensei left to his youthful successors around the world. It's called *Champions of Hope*o. Just started reading it over coffee before the first shoot.

Today is a very special day for me. 6/13/18 I was awake at 430 am and noticed that I felt weird. Not sure what. Just weird.  At 7am my daughter, who was living with me at the time, got up to get her 6 year old son ready for his last day of kindergarten. My grandson. The absolute love of my life. 
I called out to her and told her that I felt weird and she looked at me like my head was spinning with green pea soup flying out. 
""Mom. You don't sound OK. Maybe we should go to the hospital?"" 
""Sure. Call Swartz. I like them best.""
"" Ummmm mom. You get who you get I'm calling 911""
All the first responders showed up to my house and at that moment was the first time I heard someone say ""possible stroke"". They were asking me questions and I was answering correctly and cracking jokes. I was only 51 at the time. 
They load me up and off we go to the Emergency Room. As they are unloading me, the first doctor asked me if I wanted the drug that stops a stroke. ""If I'm having one and you can stop it then YES!"" 
They get me in the back and give me some pill and soon I'm feeling just a bit better. People were everywhere doing everything, it was loud and they kept bothering me to talk to them. 
Soon my youngest daughter arrives after dropping off my grandson. Then my oldest daughter arrives and together they find out that their mother may not make it. I was having a stroke, heart attack and blood clots in all major organs including my brain. My mother was being called to potentially have to bury her second child. 
Tests tests and more tests. Now it's looking better but you may lose your right leg. I'm OK with that as long as I live. My mom arrives and is a shade of white I've never seen on a human.
I am finally stabilized enough for ICU and I'm moved up there. More tests. More scans,10 days and $350,000 later, I'm allowed to go home. To this day, I'm the hospital and cardiology miracle patient. We still don't know what caused it but I'm still here dammit!!! With both legs!!!

1lajpb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/1lajpb8/n1_experiment_no_food_contact_plastic_food/,N=1 experiment - No food contact plastic food,"As you can gather from my posts I am deep down the rabit hole of metabolic disruptors causing obesity. In particular, plasticisers in the food we eat, which are meant to be the bulk of exposure.  

But what is a theory without testing? So I have been looking to minimise exposure in the last 6 months. This is way harder than it looks & results have been mixed.

Results:

- 6lbs lost in 6 months. Very slow.

- perfect control of hunger when eating non-contaminated foods. Ad lib 1400-1500kcal eating. It feels like I am on ozempic again, for free - no food noise at all & I can forget to eat. Very similar to the potato diet experience - once staying away from contaminants for 1-2 days, at lib appetite drops dramatically. 

- energy levels not quite where they need to be. Mostly sleeping longer & sometimes visibly doing less. This is probably what stops the weight loss. Mind though that energy levels are much better than during times when I gained weight! However, longer stretches of no contamination (5 days+) bring a burst of energy (again similar to potato diet!). 

- body temperature skews low (36.15C / 36.5C averages depending on cycle phase). 


Why it's hard?

The key problem is - how can you tell you're eating plasticiser contaminated foods without a lab? Well, you can't. You need to apply constant guess work to figure it out. I have started with the observation that if I eat 100% uncontaminated, edible part untouched by technology food (say just peeled potatoes with tiny bit of fat or nuts in shells), my ad lib appetite drops to under 1500kcal, whithin 48hrs of starting. By that point, I could forget to eat / be satisfied with very little at a meal. If in any given day, I eat things that could potentially be contaminated, my ad-lib appetite is significantly higher (over 2000kcal, often 2500-3000kcal). The appetite itself would be a 'food seeking' behaviour - being more aware of food smell & availability, craving it, looking to get it, etc. as opposed to not getting satiety at meals - so I could have a meal, be full for the time being, but back looking for food within a couple of hours. When that happened, I tried to figure out what food caused it. 

This has resulted in a lot of obsessive food journalling, every single day, including qualitative info on how hungry a food made me feel, etc.  but I guess it's all for science! 

I have by now worked out a list of safe foods which constitute the bulk of the diet (potatoes, peelable fruit and veg, nuts in shells, boilled rice, home milled flour, home rendered lard, etc. - diet skews high carb, low-ish protein). If I stick to them and minimal extras (soy sauce, coffee, milk, bit of sugar), I am ad-lib under 1500kcal. Some contaminated foods are obvious (fast food & ready meals, tinned foods, commercial bread and pastry) but most are not obvious at all (flour, waxed fruit and vegetables eaten skin on, all dehulled nuts and seeds, all dried fruit tea, some filtered water, most booze etc.).

In the process of working out what's safe and what isn't, I was probably getting 1-2 contamination 'hits' per week, meaning ad-lib 2500kcal+ each time. Therefore my average calorie intake was 1800-1900kcal for this period or more. This is all fairly no pufa - except monkey nuts which I found terribly convenient! Full ad-lib eating or else would not make any sense. 


What's next:

1lajngi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lajngi,Having more bad runs than good lately (possibly due to weather?). Looking for tips on how I can have less failed runs and commiseration!,"Hey! 

First 2 pictures are of my easy 6 mile run from a couple weeks ago that I felt went really well (walked 5 min total) vs my easy 7 mile run from today that I felt did not go well at all (walked 17 minutes). On my run today I was getting so discouraged seeing I was in zone 4 not even a mile out. Usually takes me 4 or 5 miles to consistently start getting there. I eventually just stopped looking at my watch screen and that did help but on mile 5 I pretty much totally hit a wall and had to start doing run/ walk. At the end of the run I felt borderline dizzy and just not good. 

I’ve been running 4-5 days a week for almost a year and I’m doing my first half marathon plan with Runna now. My fear is if I can’t even do my 7 mile easy run today how am I going to do the timed 7 mile long run next week with pace targets? In the last few weeks I’ve done several 6 mile runs with pace targets and they were challenging but I completed them perfectly. Not sure what happened today! I’ve hade several runs in the last couple weeks where I just ran out of gas. 

I had half a bagel with peanut butter and a banana before the run, a cup of coffee, and half a glass of water. Also brought water with me on the run and some candy. I have some gels at home but I wasn’t thinking I’d need them until I start going 8 miles and over. 

I wanted to attribute the bad runs to weather, but today was about 80 degrees and overcast with a lovely breeze. Humidity is 80%, which is high, but is that enough of a factor to affect me that badly with the otherwise nice weather? 7 miles is the farthest I’ve gone but in the past on my 7 mile runs I didn’t struggle this bad at all. Totally open to all tips!! Thanks!! 

P.S.: I have seen that the biggest advice for running in the hot weather is to slow down but I really don’t think I can go slower than my current 14-15 mile pace. In cold weather my easy pace is 13-14 min mile so I am slowing down but today it didn’t feel enough.  ",5,1749830472.0,XXRunning,3,1.0,False

Also here's a brief excerpt from a fic im cooking

*Hod finally learned of Binah's big predicament, and immediately resolved herself to help Binah find her balance at her height. This of course, came with its own issues, but regardless, they were going to relearn how to navigate the library.*

*While Binah carefully made her way to the floor of literature, the amount of bookshelves cluttering the path on the way there made things extremely difficult. Chesed, without a care in the world, followed behind, sipping his coffee.*
""Let's stop to rest for a moment."" *Hod said, wiping her brow. Binah sheepishly nodded.*
""**Alright, my dear finch. We shall rest.**"" *Binah said while adjusting her footing. However, the back of her heel got caught on a bookshelf, and she began to lose her footing, tipping backwards almost comically... right where Chesed was standing*
""LOOK OU-!"" *Hod practically screamed, reaching out to Chesed, though the blue haired noble was too absorbed in his cup of coffee to notice in time. He simply looked up from his drink, and saw two black orbs that was Binah's rear end falling upon him.*

***KRAKOOM!***

*Binah's behemoth behind completely smothered chesed as she hit the floor with tremendous force. Dust was kicked up, shelves rattled, books were sent airborne, and the floorboars rippled outwards, buckling and groaning before inevitably splintering. Bits of debris in the form of dust and woodchips were sent scattering away from the impact, in which Chesed was unfortunate enough to experience at point blank. When the dust settled, She clutched at her rear, and felt a familiar object, now broken. She winced, standing up, only for chesed to fall off of her buttocks, collapsing into the peculiar crater she made. Binah simply turned away after looking at her work.*

I’m a London-based 30-something who’ll be in town \*\*mid-July → late-August (≈45 days)\*\* for work near \*\*Culver City\*\*.  Weekdays are packed, so I’m free mostly \*\*Friday night through Sunday\*\*.



\*\*Goals\*\*

• Taste the \*signature\* LA bites (tacos, breakfast burritos, smash-burgers, proper coffee).

• Check out farmers’-market pop-ups, food trucks & one “splurge” tasting menu.

• Avoid tourist traps \*and\* any sketchy blocks if I’m wandering solo after dark.



\*\*A few constraints & preferences\*\*

• No car on weekdays – I’ll Metro/Ride-share; happy to rent a car on weekends.  

• Budget: <$20 for casual eats, one or two blow-outs up to \~$150 pp.  

• Diet: everything goes except cilantro soap gene 🙃  

• Already bookmarked Sonoratown, République bakery window, Howlin’ Ray’s hot chicken.



\*\*What I’m looking for\*\*

1. \*\*Weekend food itineraries\*\* (e.g., “start Sat. morning at \_\_\_ farmers market → K-town lunch crawl → SGV dinner”).  

2. Hidden-gem coffee roasters near Culver City/Palms for weekday mornings.  

3. Any neighbourhoods where a first-timer should extra-mind personal safety at night.  

4. Etiquette—do LA food trucks still prefer cash? OK to photograph prep if I ask?

Brain broken by VHCOL community, help me calibrate.","Throw away account for the usual reasons. Hoping this community can help me calibrate expectations as I start a new chapter.

I’m a multi-time entrepreneur and have been fortunate to have some good outcomes with a dash of lucky market timing along the way. If my life weren’t about to change, I could continue with my existing standard of living and have total flexibility professionally (which is my top priority.) However, I have some big life changes coming up, and I’m having a hard time calibrating.

As mentioned in the title, I’m getting married (a bit later than the norm) and live in a coastal VHCOL area. I’m mid-40s and my fiance is early-30s. My biggest questions are around kids, which we plan to have pretty quickly, and no one seems to be able to give me a straight answer about expenses. It’s always “it depends” and it’s hard for my childless self to relate.

My reality is also skewed by the fact that I spend a lot of time with people who have been even more successful than I, and it makes it hard to calibrate what “normal” looks like. I didn’t come from wealth and am frugal by nature, so I’m very comfortable living within my means, but does that all go out the window with kids?

I made the decision to leave the company that acquired my last startup, and I have no future work plans. I truly enjoy creating things and the art of business itself, so I’m sure I’ll end up generating income, but would love not to optimize for that. I’m wondering if that’s naive, and if I should have more urgency to maximize earnings while I have a lot of options in the job market.

Here are some key stats:

\~$7m net worth

\~$5m in liquid assets, \~$500k of that in retirement accounts. Mostly in diversified, low cost ETFs and target date funds

\~$3.5m in real estate with \~$1.5m mortgage debt at ZIRP rates of 2-4%. I currently live in one property and have two rentals that cash flow.

\~$200k/yr in passive income between rental properties, dividends, and interest income

\~$300k/yr spending on everything including taxes and mortgage payments with no other debt.

I also have a bunch of other angel investments and startup equity that’s worth quite a bit on paper, but I prefer not to consider it in my financial planning since I know the risks there.

My fiance still works and makes \~$120k/year and plans to keep working, at least until we have kids.

So what do you think? Should I go out and get a big boy job while I can, knowing that expenses will increase with kids? Or should we both quit our jobs and open a coffee shop for shits and giggles?

Chapter one: Coffee Shop



Jessica



As I was working on my laptop, I prayed that it didn't crash again before I could finish my work. My pen was held between my teeth as I was eager to finally get my assignment done before the night ends.



I was sitting at my favorite coffee shop, it was pretty quiet at this hour which was a bonus for me because I could concentrate much more without the distraction of my roommate. It is not that I don't get along with her but I have different ways of studying. I liked studying alone in a quiet space with a coffee next to me but my roommate likes studying with a group of friends while the music is on.



Finally, I completed my assignment and sent it to my professor before my laptop shut down immediately as I exited the website. I rolled my eyes, thankfully it had crashed right after my work was done. I checked my time and I found out that I had a little spare time before walking back to the hostel. I decided to open one of my textbooks to read but got disappointed as I was out of coffee. I debated on getting another cup but the last thing I needed at this hour was more caffeine.



I buried myself deeply immersed in the pages that I didn't notice the coffeemaker placed a steaming cup of coffee next to me. I looked up, confused but before I could ask a question he walked away. I looked down at the coffee, even though it smelled good. I couldn't shake off the thought, what if it was spiked. Who would buy me a coffee without saying a word?



I looked around the shop, possibly to see if I could see anyone and then my eyes landed on a tall man, clad in a black suit and his curly hair coiffed. His hazel eyes locked with mine and he stood up, starting walking towards me.



He was the definition of hot, stunning, intimidating and sexy all in one. His legs took a long stride to reach my booth, his fancy shoes clicking against the tiled floor.



""You look like you could use another cup of coffee."" His voice was husky and alluring, I nodded pressing my lips.



""Thanks, it will definitely help me.""



""May I sit?"" he gestured to the bench in front of me.



""Yes of course.""



He sat down, placing his cup of coffee in front of him before pulling out his phone from his pocket. He frowned looking at the screen before putting it back into his pocket.



""May I ask what a college student like you is doing at the coffee shop this late on friday night?""



""What made you think I am still in college?"" I blew on my coffee before drinking it, goodness he bought me a good one.



""Well, you have a backpack by your feet and your laptop has Covenant University stickers on it.""



""I am studying."" I tucked a loose strand of hair behind my ear.



""On a Friday night? Don't you college kids go to parties and stuff on weekends?""



""Other students do but I don't, it is not my thing.""



Goodness, did he just say college kids? How old is this guy? He doesn't look much older than me to be honest. He leaned forward, his eyebrows furrowed in confusion.



""This is the first time I am meeting a college student that didn't like going to parties on weekends."" I shrugged.



""I would rather drink and chill in my hostel with friends rather than go out and pray I get home safely."" He raised his eyebrows and nodded, taking a sip of his coffee.



""Well, that does sound more like my kind of scene anyway.""



""Are you in college?"" He scoffed and shook his head.



""No, Princess. I am actually forty years old and already a graduate.""



What? He is forty but he looked like he is my age and I am only twenty.



""You look quite good for your age."" I squeezed my eyes shut immediately.



""I am so sorry, I shouldn't have said that."" He probably thinks I am awkward as hell now.



""It is fine, Princess."" He smirked, revealing the cutest dimples on his cheeks.



""Well, I will let you continue studying. It was nice meeting you.""



""It was nice meeting you too.""



""I am Jeffrey, Jeff for short."" He stretched his hand and I took it in mine, trying not to show on my face how shocked I was seeing how large his hands were.



""Jessica."" I returned the smile.



""Wow, beautiful name, it definitely suits you."" He winked, making my heart skip a beat before leaving the coffee shop.



The next morning, I woke up around ten o'clock seeing my roommate Olivia asleep on top of her sheet. She was still wearing the same clothes and heels she wore to the party last night. I quickly changed into some athletic shorts. I always like running on Saturday morning because everyone in the campus will either be sleeping or working. It gives me an advantage to have the campus cool and all to myself.



I took my usual route after stretching, pretty much just jogging around the perimeter of the campus. My ears were stuck with my headphones playing some music to keep me in the zone. I came up on the main street, deciding to take a walking break. Passing by the coffee shop, I saw my best friend Janice. She was leaving the coffee shop with two large cups of coffee in her hands.



""Hey, Janice."" I said, catching my breath.



""Why are you up here so early?""



""Hey, Jessica. I came to get a coffee run for me and Evelyn. We are going shopping today, want to come along?"" I nodded.



""Sure, I mean I need to shower but I am a bit down.""



""Okay, well we aren't leaving until noon so that we can eat lunch while we are downtown. I will text you.""



""Okay, see you.""



I said goodbye and continued my running, taking a shortcut through the campus to get back to my hostel faster. I probably shouldn't go shopping today with my limited flow of cash and my lack of job findings.



I spent most of the money I made this summer repairing my laptop only to have it crash nearly all the time. I wanted to trade it in or sell it and get some money out of it but I didn't expect it to bring me much cash, let alone enough to buy a new computer.



Janice came to my hostel almost at noon with Evelyn and all three of us went downtown for the shopping.



""What about this?"" Janice pulled a dress from the rack, holding it against her body in an attempt to model it for me.



""I like the style but it definitely not your color."" She rolled her eyes, placing the dress back in its original spot and continued searching for another.



""I cursed my awkward skin tone."" She muttered, I shook my head and chuckled.



Looking through the clearance rack like I always did, I loved finding cute clothes for half of the original price, it was like Christmas. We were currently at the department store downtown trying to find a dress for Janice's sorority formal. Evelyn was in the shoe section trying to find some new heels.



As I was looking through the racks, I noticed a familiar figure standing in front of the store right across from us. It was Jeffrey, he was holding a shopping bag and talking on the phone looking visibly distraught. I looked away immediately before he caught me staring and admiring him. Looking through the racks more but my focus wasn't even on the clothes anymore. As I turned back again, I saw that he had noticed me, giving me a small wave. I waved back, smiling as his discouraged expression turned into a grin, revealing two deep dimples on his cheeks.



My happiness was soon cut short when a tall brunette walked over to him, clad in skinny jeans, a cute floral top and nude boot wedge. They talked for a while before he kissed her cheek and walked out together.



He never told me that he is taken, then again why should it matter to me? I am only twenty and he is twice my age, he would never have a thing with me, that is bizarre beyond compare.



But then, maybe it was just a friendly kiss. Kissing one on the cheeks doesn't mean they are dating, right? I just sighed and looked away, trying to not let it ruin my day with my friends.



We continued our shopping and I was able to pick a dress of my choice at a lower price. Janice also got a dress that matched her skin tone. We had lunch at the restaurant downtown before returning back to the campus.







# Chapter two: Partying



Chapter two: Partying



Jessica



""So, you are coming with us right?"" Olivia said as she stood in front of her small closet. Her hands on her hips and only wearing a towel, her hair wet and sticking to her shoulder.



I gave her a look and shook my head before turning to my laptop.



""You should already know the answer to that.""



""Come on, Jessica."" She groaned.



""You have never gone out with us and it is almost coming to the end of the semester. Can you at least go out this once?""



""I would rather not."" I replied, clicking next on the movie I was watching.



""You can't sit here and watch movies all night. What did you do last weekend?""



""Studied."" I shrugged.



Last weekend was when I met Jeffrey and I haven't talked to him or seen him since then. It is not like I was upset or anything but I was a little bummed, I guess.



She rolled her eyes, walking over to my bed and shutting my laptop close.



""Come out with us.""



""Olivia…..!"" I warned but she cut me off.



""Let us make a deal, you go out with us tonight and if you don't like it. I will personally bring you back home, no arguing or anything."" I rolled my lips between my teeth, that sounded better.



""But I don't have anything to wear.""



""Oh goodness.""



She walked back to her closet, pulling out a burgundy long sleeved crop top and blue leather shorts.



""Oh no, I am definitely not wearing that."" I stood up from my bed, shaking my head.



""Have you seen your ass? It is banging and you need to show it off tonight.""



I pouted, somehow agreeing. I had a shower before her so my hair was fairly dry as she started straightening it. My hair was naturally very curly so trying to straighten it perfectly is a real pain but it can be done. We both put on our outfit after she was done with my hair. She was wearing a black high waisted skirt and a red halter crop top. Why did she have so many crop tops?



She then went on to do my makeup which I found rather relaxing and almost fell asleep at one point. By the time she was done, I didn't even look like myself again. My lips were pink , my eyes smoldering with dark colors, making my hazel irises pop and my cheeks perfectly contoured and highlighted.



She packed her own hair into a tight ponytail, putting on makeup as well. She looked pretty good, I must say. I had never seen her makeup right after she applied it, I usually only catch a glimpse of it when she comes back from partying and it is smudged all over her cheeks.



""Ready?"" She asked, slipping into some red sneakers and she tossed me some blue bootie wedges.



I shrugged, slipping them on and following her out of our room.



Her friends, Harry and Steven joined us when we walked outside. There were two fraternity boys in the campus and they apparently knew the best places to party.



""So you are twenty, right?"" Harry asked and I nodded sheepishly.



""Alex is having a killer party tonight."" Steven said as we began the journey down the street away from the hostel.



""I thought we were going to the lounge?"" Harry asked and I pretended to know these places when I had never even heard of them.



""No, Alex got the dance floor finally opened."" Steven replied.



I simply crossed my arms and remained quiet on our journey to Alex or whatever. As we got to the place, I found out that it was actually a club. I followed them inside, shamefully letting the bouncer see my ID and letting me in with a wristband that indicated I was able to drink.



Olivia pulled me along, making sure I stayed with them at all times. I noticed that the dance floor was pretty filled with other college students, a lot of them freshman and sophomore who had somehow managed to get drinks themselves.



""Want a drink, Jess?"" Steven shouted to me over the blaring music.



I opened my mouth but I didn't know what to say. I never had a drink at the club before, let alone mixed drinks in general.



""Surprise me."" I replied as confident as I could even though I didn't know the names of any drinks.



He nodded and left for the bar counter, leaving me with Olivia and Harry but they already started kissing in front of me. I looked away awkwardly, I didn't even know that she had a thing with him since we have only been here for a little over a month.



I looked around the room seeing no one that looked familiar on campus. I almost wanted to tell Olivia that I needed to head back to the hostel but we just got here and I didn't want to ruin it for her.



I suddenly glanced up towards the second level balcony of the bar where there was another counter and a few more tables for people. It wasn't until I made eye contact with the man sitting at the table next to the railing that my stomach completely dropped. Jeffrey and he was here with that brunette.



I wanted to run but I couldn't tear my gaze away from him and he looked equally shocked to see me here as well. I quickly looked away as his date began to follow his eyes towards me. Steven walked over to me at that moment with my drink.



I took a sip after thanking him and I could taste pineapple juice. The drink was some sort of fruit concoction and lots of coconut rum. It was pretty good but it definitely burned my throat slightly on the way down. I avoided looking back up at Jeffrey even though I wanted nothing more than to lock my eyes with him.



Harry and Olivia tore their lips away from each other long enough to get drinks, leaving me with Jeffrey's burning stares at the back of my head.



""Want to dance?"" He asked.



""Hmmm, sure.""



I finished off the rest of my drink, hoping not to lose a little more as he took my hand and led me down to the already sticky dance floor. I glanced up at Jeffrey one last time, seeing his eyes still on me and turned back to Steven, letting him rest his hand on my hips as we danced along to the music.



I took three more drinks and I was already buzzing. I was pretty sure that if I had another cup, I wouldn't be able to walk properly. Harry and Olivia had joined us on the dance floor, grinding against each other and their lips meeting every couple minutes.



In that heat of the moment, I kind of wanted to kiss Steven but I would probably regret it in the morning since I don't even know his last name. I leaned over to Olivia and excused myself to use the restroom, telling her I would return right away and she should wait for me.



I left the dance floor, looking up momentarily to see that Jeffrey had left as well as his date. I shrugged it off and entered the restroom, quickly relieving myself so I could get back with the group.



As I made my way out of the restroom, I instantly bumped into a hard body. Quickly apologizing as I looked up at his face.



""H….hi, Jeff."" I shuttered.



""Hello, Jessica."" He smiled, he was carrying a large glass of a red drink, one of which was had earlier.



""I thought you weren't the party type?"" He raised an eyebrow with a slight smirk.



""My roommate dragged me here with her male friends."" Blinking a few times so my vision would go back to normal and I pointed to his glass.



""Can I have a sip?""



I took the straw between my fingers and took a big gulp of his drink, the liquor burning all the way down my throat.



""Are you drunk?"" He frowned and I shrugged.



""I don't know, I have had like three or four glasses and then yours.""



He pressed his lips and looked over to the dance floor before returning back to me. I noticed that the shirt he was wearing was unbuttoned, revealing the tattoo ink on his collarbone, causing my curiosity to take over me. I reached forward, my fingers pushing the fabric of his shirt aside and seeing the two eagles resting on his skin. For some reason, I found it incredibly sexy knowing he had a tattoo. When my fingers came in contact with his skin, I could see him almost suck in a breath as he watched intently.



""Two resting eagles."" I muttered.



""Two resting eagles."" He repeated, a low tone in his voice and his jade eyes staring intently at me.







# Chapter three: He Is Cute And Hot



Chapter three: He Is Cute And Hot



Jessica



""Will you take me home?"" I said, not even thinking about what I was saying before the words left my mouth.



""Are you sure?"" His tongue swipes his bottom lips.



""Won't your friends be worried?"" I waved my hand.



""Don't worry, I will just text Olivia. lt is fine.""



He nodded and took a sip of his drink before he placed a hand on my lower back, guiding me to the exit of the club. As we got outside, a black limousine was waiting down the street.



""Wow, look at that baby. I wonder who it belongs to."" I looked at him.



""It…umh belong to me.""



He led me to the car where the driver opened the door. He let me get in first and the driver shut the door right after we both were settled in the backseat. The black leather smooth against my bare thighs and I ran my fingers over the sleek interior, accidentally pressing a button and opening a cooler full of wine.



""Wow."" I gasped.



""This is so cool.""



He reached over, his hand brushing mine as he pressed the button, closing the cooler.



""The last thing you need now is another drink, my dear.""



""Okay."" I scoffed, leaning back in my seat and crossing my arms childishly. I saw him awkwardly cross his legs in my peripheral vision, his lips rolled inward between his teeth.



When we finally reached my hostel, he offered to walk me to my room. I willingly obliged, taking Olivia's shoes off while we waited for the elevator. I swayed back and forth for support, unlocking my room and letting him inside. I immediately throw myself on the bed, burying my face into the pillow.



""Are you going to sleep just like that?"" He chuckled, I nodded into the fabric, opening my eyes and frowning.



""Wait….this is not my pillow."" I rolled over and looked at the bed across, giggling to myself and pointing to it.



""That is my bed."" He shook his head, a visible grin on his face because of my foolishness.



I tried to get up but my arms were so wobbly that I couldn't do it. After a few seconds of struggling, I whined and held my arms out to him.



""Carry me.""



""Excuse me?"" He raised his eyebrows.



""Carry me, I can't get up.""



""Your bed is literally four feet away from you, Jessica.""



""I can't get up.""



He sighed, walking over and slipping his arms under my back and knees. He picked me up with no effort needed and placed me on the correct bed.



""You are so strong."" I giggled.



""Thanks.""



He avoided my gaze, pulling my sheet over my body. I could see his two resting eagles tattoo sticking out his shirt. I reached up and pulled his collar aside again to look at them one. It looks so sexy on him, I wanted to pull him closer for a kiss but I couldn't.



""Two resting eagles."" I murmured, my eyelids growing heavy.



""Two resting eagles."" He whispered back.



I yawned, closing my eyes and pulling my duvet up to my neck, snuggling into its warmth.



""You have to show me the rest of your tattoos someday.""



""What makes you think I have more?""



""Because I can see a glimpse of the one on your wrist but I am too tired to see what it is right now.""



He chuckled slightly before saying goodnight and shutting the light off. That is the last I remember before falling into a deep sleep.



Next morning, I woke up with my head pounding and the sunlight far too bright for my liking. I groaned, pulling a pillow over my face, looking over at Olivia's bed but it was empty. Then I noticed a glass of water on the side table next to my bed, two small pills and a written note with my name on it.



I picked up the note and saw Jeffrey's messy handwriting scrawling on the paper.



'Jessica, take this when you wake up. They will make you feel better, call me if you need anything else.'



At the bottom of the note was his phone number, I smiled to myself rereading his messy penmanship a couple times before popping the medicine in my mouth and drank some water to settle it down.



It was already noon when I finally decided to get out of the bed, slipping out of my clothes and putting on my robe. Grabbing my towel and shower caddy, I headed to the bathroom. Letting the hot water run down my body, I washed all the dirt and grime from last night. It was only then did I remember that I didn't text Olivia but she didn't message me either, I guess she wasn't too worried about me.



After cleaning all the makeup leftover off and came out of the bathroom. I made my way to our food storage drawers to get some snacks for lunch. I really didn't want to go to the dining hall, I felt too tired to see people and talk to anyone. So I just heated up the noodles in the microwave and sat on my bed, watching some movie on my laptop.



Looking at Jeffrey's note, I wondered if I should text him and thank him for last night. I debated over it for fifteen minutes before pulling out my phone and sending him a message.



'Thank you for saving me and taking care of me last night, I really appreciate it.' Instantly, I got a response from him.



'You are welcome, Princess. How are you feeling now?'



I smiled at how he always called me Princess. I quickly sent him another message, telling him that I am feeling much better but definitely not another night like that anytime soon before Olivia walked in, wearing a button up dress shirt that barely covered her rear, her sneakers dangling from her fingers.



""Did you walk across campus just like that?"" Her pants were fully displayed.



""Yes.""



She groaned into her pillow and I could hear her soft snore. My phone beamed, revealing a message from Jeffrey.



'Any time soon? Does that mean there will be more nights like that in the future for a non-party girl like Jessica?' I smiled and replied to him.



'I hope not but as long as I don't drink as much, then maybe I will consider it.' He responded immediately.



'Well, if you ever want another night out, I would love to join you. We can talk about my vast collection of tattoos that you are so interested in.'



I suddenly remembered all the times I caught myself staring at his chest and wrist, wondering how many more tattoos he has littered on his body. It was so mysterious yet so sexy.



What am I even saying? He is a forty year old man and I am just twenty. I don't think getting close to him would be a good idea.



'I might take you up on that offer.' I texted him.



'I will look forward to it, I have to get back to work now. I will talk to you later, my dear.'



I shut my phone and opened my laptop, checking some emails and social media but nothing could take my mind off Jeffrey.



What was it that made him so attractive? Sure, he is good looking and he obviously had a stable job to afford his expensive clothes and luxurious cars but he is older than me. I have never even liked a guy two years older than me, let alone twenty years older.



I finished my noodles, washing the dishes afterwards. I heard Olivia shuffle around in her bed and suddenly, she spoke.



""Who did you go home with last night?""



""Just a friend."" I didn't look at her, I just shrugged.



""Just a friend?"" She mocked.



""Was it a guy? Did something happen last night?""



""No, Olivia. He just brought me back home.""



""Ah, so it was a guy.""



""Just drop it, Olivia."" I rolled my eyes, grabbing my phone and laptop heading over to Janice and Evelyn's room.



I always go there to hang out especially when I want to avoid conversation with Olivia like this moment. Thankfully, their room was open and when I walked in, I saw Janice on the couch with her laptop but Evelyn was not in the room.



""Hey,"" I said, sitting down next to her.



""Hello."" She responded.



""I was about to order some food, do you want anything?"" I shook my head.



""No, I just had some noodles….but you can get me some chips."" She rolled her eyes but added chips to her orders.



""Why did you come over here? Olivia annoying you?"" I nodded, absent-mindedly checking my phone to see if I got a text from Jeffrey.



""Yes, she was talking about stuff I didn't want to discuss.""



""Will you discuss it with me then?"" I shrugged.



""It is nothing, we just went out last night.""



""You left with a guy, didn't you?"" She smiled.



""No!"" I said but quickly added.



""I mean, kind of.""



""Was he cute?"" I nodded.



""He is very cute and hot.""



""Then that is all I needed to know.""



I shook my head and smile before pulling my laptop onto my lap, attempting to get a head start on my philosophy assignment before she asked her next question.







# Chapter four: Lunch With Him



Chapter four: Lunch With Him



Jessica



""How old is he?"" Janice asked, I didn't look at her. I just continued working on my laptop before responding.



""I thought that was all you needed to know?""



""And now, I want to know how old he is."" Shutting her laptop and sitting up facing me.



""Is he younger?"" I shook my head and scoffed.



""Oh, no. Definitely not."" It wasn't until after I blurted out that I realized I can't take back my words.



""He is older."" She gasped.



""It is like he has his own establishment.""



""Goodness, Jessica. I never thought that you would go for an older man. What is his major?""



""I don't know, Janice. I just met him, I don't have all the details.""



""Ah, but I need information and it is my job to interrogate you.""



""No, it is most certainly not."" I laughed.



""I want to meet this guy sometime.""



""He literally took me home and that was it. We didn't talk much about it and I doubt if I will see him again any time soon.""



But that was a lie, I didn't know how soon Jeffrey wanted to see again. All I knew was that I couldn't wait to see him again.



The weekend is over and I am excited to go to class. It is Monday morning and I managed to wake up at seven o'clock, getting dressed and pulling my curly hair up into a ponytail. I put on my usual amount of makeup which was definitely less than what Olivia applied on my face Saturday night. Olivia was still laying on her bed snoring, so I quietly shut the door when I left for my lectures.



The first lecture was boring as usual, listening to the professor drone on and on about eleventh century artists and comparing styles of painting. I was a fan of art, I loved oil paint above all things but I never had a streak of being artsy. I would probably start a painting one day and not finish it in the next weeks because I cannot be patient. I loved history which brought me to this humanities class. I loved society back in the days whether it was the first century or twenty-first century, I just loved learning about royalty, the papacy and art. History is endless and I wanted to be able to study even deeper into how society worked before my great grandfathers as well as before their great grandfathers.



The lecturer dismissed us and I headed to my next class which was history. Janice was in the class with me which helped because having two lectures back to back in the morning was always hard for me. But I liked the lectures done early so I could return back to my hostel and have time to take a nap.



""Hi, Jess."" She greeted me as I sat down in my usual seat which was next to hers.



""Did you speak with that guy again?"" I rolled my eyes, this is not what I wanted to talk about.



""No, I haven't spoken to him.""



""Do you even know how to live?""



""Yes, I know how to live. I just met him, why do you expect us to be besties or something?""



""Because you never talk to boys, I feel like a proud mother.""



""Oh, shut up."" Immediately the professor walked in.



After an hour, the lecture was over and we were packing up our things. She had to go for her next class but I was done for the day so I went back to my hostel. Olivia was still in class and will only be returning around eight in the evening. Basically, I had the entire day all to myself.



I wanted to text Jeffrey but my gut told me no. Who was that brunette he was with at the club? He couldn't have been taken, otherwise he wouldn't have wanted to get together with me again, right? These thoughts were reeling in my brain as I changed into some more comfortable clothes, pulling my laptop onto my lap and opening my favorite movie.



Jeffrey is good looking, I won't deny it but he has a girlfriend. Then why does he want to hang out with me again? And where did that girl go when he took me home on that Saturday night? I decided to ignore the thoughts, telling myself that if he truly wanted to talk to me, he would make the first move. Boys are supposed to do that, I think.



I was only on the first episode of the movie when my phone started to buzz. Jeffrey's name showing on the screen, I hesitated before picking up the call.



""Hello?"" I said, praying I didn't sound so nervous as I felt.



""Hello, Princess."" His raspy voice spoke on the other side of the call.



""Are you busy?"" I shook my head and then stupidly remembered that he couldn't see me.



""No, actually I am not.""



""Perfect, would you like to join me for lunch?"" My stomach flipped.



""Lunch?""



""Yes, I can send a car to come and pick you up if you would like.""



Do I say yes? I mean he made the first move. Of course I should say yes.



""Yes, I would love to.""



""I will have it pick you up in the next twenty minutes.""



""Okay, see you soon.""



""Bye, Princess.""



Words couldn't describe the butterflies I felt every time he called me that. I quickly put on new clothes, stealing one of Olivia's black shirts and a pair of boyfriend jeans as she always called them. I wore one of my long necklaces, letting my hair out of the ponytail and fluffing out the curls. I grabbed my purse and key and quickly sprayed myself with a bit of perfume. I walked out of my room heading to the location where the limousine dropped Jeffrey and I off the other night.



Thankfully, it was a sleek black sports car that was parked outside the hostel because I didn't. I would be able to explain myself if anyone sees me hopping into the limousine.



It was the same driver that drove the limousine, he opened the back door for me. I thanked him and asked for his name which turned out to be Luke. We drove off the campus, I forgot to ask Jeffrey where he was taking me so I looked at the driver and asked.



""Did Jeffrey say where we would be having lunch?"" He glanced at me through his center mirror.



""You will be joining Mr. Craig for lunch in his office.""



His office? Where in the world was his office? As we drove deeper into the city, the building grew taller and the streets grew less and less familiar. Came to a halt and pulled into a parallel parking space labeled Craig Fashion and Co. Goodness, he is the CEO? My heart raced at how underdressed I was.



Luke opened the door for me, I stepped out onto the pavement, looking up at the tall building with awe. Turning back to Luke, I asked an awkward question.



""Do I just walk in?"" He nodded with a slight chuckle.



""Yes, tell the receptionist that you are here to see Mr. Craig and they will take it from there."" I nodded.



""Okay, thank you.""



Taking a deep breath, I walked through the revolving door with ease and tried not to let my jaw drop at the exquisite interior. White walls and matching white couches with black decor, modern art on the walls and chandeliers littering the ceiling. I walked towards the front desk, smiling at the older woman.



""Hello, how can I help you?"" She said.



""I am here to see Mr. Craig."" She raised her eyebrows at me, not even looking at her computer before asking the next question.



""Do you have an appointment?"" I nodded.



She still didn't seem to believe me but also still didn't check her computer or even think to ask for my name.



""Baby girl, Mr. Craig is a very busy man and I don't think he has time for fangirls to come visit him.""



""You don't believe me?""



I asked in disbelief, she shook her head going back to her computer to continue on with her work. I rolled my lips between my teeth before pulling out my phone right in front of her, dialing Jeffrey's number and I could feel her eyes on me.



""Hello, Princess."" His voice sang sweetly into the phone.



""Hello, Jeffrey."" I responded and the receptionist's eyes widened.



""The receptionist at the front desk down the group floor is refusing to let me in.""



""Give her the phone."" His tone changed to a more serious one as I handed the phone to the frazzled lady.



""Hello, sir?"" She muttered, her entire demeanor had changed and I felt bad but then again I had this sudden surge of confidence that I kind of liked.



""Yes, sir. I will make sure she has a pass key."" She hung up the call, visibly stressed.



She typed some information into the computer before a small beep was heard and she handed me a card.



""This is your pass key, you swipe it in the elevator and it will take you directly to the top floor. Show it to the receptionist up there and she will direct you to Mr. Craig's office."" She explained in a monotone voice.



""Thank you."" I smiled, taking the pass key from her and heading towards the elevator.



The door opened, revealing a sleek, dark interior and metal railing. I swiped the pass key through the slot by the bottom, the door instantly closed and took me to the fifteen floor where Jeffrey's office awaited.







# Chapter five: One-on-one Date



Chapter five: One-on-one Date



Jessica



Stepping out of the elevator, there were many employees wearing very sophisticated clothes, one that made me feel very out of place. I rubbed my arms awkwardly as I walked up to the front door, another woman who is a little younger than one sitting on the ground floor. She looked up at me with a straight face.



""Can I help you?""



""Yes,"" I responded, showing her the pass key.



""I am here to see Mr. Craig."" Her face dropped just the slightest.



""And your name?""



""Jessica Silver."" She nodded and reached for her phone, dialing some number.



""Mr. Craig, Jessica Silver is here to see you. Shall I send her in?""



A slight crackle sounded before I heard Jeffrey's voice on the other line. When she dropped the call, she pointed me to the huge double doors down the end of the hall, the ones I apparently hadn't noticed. The letters J and C were printed on either door, causing me to question even more how rich Jeffrey was. I mean, the limousine was one thing and then there was a sports car, now he had a company. This was definitely not mentioned when he was taking me home the other night.



I pushed open the doors, my heart racing with each step that brought me closer to him. He turned around in his black leather chair as soon as the door opened, his gaze landing on me and I swear he could hear the beat of my heart from across the room.



""Hello, Princess.""



I stood there, in both awe and awkwardness, taking in his attire. His blue and white striped button up was tight against his torso and arms, adoring every muscle and detail of his figure. It was buttoned up to the collar, hiding his eagle tattoo and his sleeve were rolled up to his elbow, another collection of tattoos on his tanned forearms. His black blazer rested on the back of his chair.



""Hello, Princess."" His voice was like angelic music to my ears.



""Please, have a seat.""



He indicated to one of the armchairs that were in front of his desk, I sat down, staring at his lips, his eyes. I imagined his body under the suit, goodness, I could hardly look at him without wanting him.



Behind his desk were tall windows that looked out into the city, the skyline visible from my seat. It was incredibly beautiful and I couldn't believe Jeffrey was this successful. I didn't even know the kind of business he is into.



""How have you been?"" His question made me snap back to reality and look at him.



""I….am f..fine,"" I shuttered, sounding so stupid.



""How are you?"" I asked.



""Well, the fact that you are joining me for lunch is probably the highlight of my day so far."" He grinned. I blushed, tucking a curly strand of hair behind my ear and looking down at my hands.



""I am glad that you asked me to come."" I smiled up at him, seeing the dimples on his cheeks deepen.



""Where do we have lunch?""



""Right here,"" gesturing with his hand to the right. I turned my head to see a small table by the window, a gold table cloth laid over top of it with a tiny vase holding a white rose. He pressed a button on his work phone and put the call on speaker.



""Juliet, please send my lunch request."" He stood from his chair, motioning for me to do the same.



A man in a black suit entered the office, carrying two trays with round lids. He placed them before us as I unfold the napkin on my lap. Taking the lids off revealing a beautiful meal. Shrimp Alfredo with steamed broccoli and buttery mashed potatoes. Jeffrey reached down beside him, picking up a bottle of champagne and pouring me a glass and also poured another glass for himself.



""Cheers."" I clinked my glass with his, taking a sip as he continued watching me with his beautiful eyes.



I didn't hesitate to dig in, the shrimps and pasta sauce delightful on my taste buds. I could taste every single seasoning and every detail, the food was heaven and one of the best meals I had ever taken.



""I didn't know you liked shrimps, it is a toss up with many people.""



""Oh, I am not picky. I like food a lot and trying new recipes is always fun.""



""Do you cook?"" I shrugged.



""I did that a lot at home, it was fun cooking with my mother. She was more of a baking type and I liked cooking. It was a way for us to bond when she wasn't working.""



The corner of his lips turned up as he listened to me talk about my mother. I took another sip from my glass.



""Do you like to cook?"" I asked, he smiled.



""It is probably one of my favorite things to do.""



""Well, I will love to try your cooking sometimes."" He smirked, running a hand through his curly hair.



""I would love that."" He replied.



After talking about our favorite foods and taking in the beautiful view, I finished off the last wine on my glass and wiped my mouth with the napkin. He reached over, taking the rose from the vase and twirling it between his fingers.

1laj9sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartChainGems/comments/1laj9sw/does_mitolyn_work_according_to_reddit/,Does Mitolyn Work According to Reddit?,"**Quick Verdict:** In my experience, **yes, Mitolyn works** – or at least it has for me and many others. It’s not a gimmick. After a few weeks of taking this *mitochondria support* supplement, I noticed a solid boost in my energy and metabolism. I felt more awake in the mornings and had the stamina to work out consistently.

# ✅[Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://bestad.link/mitolyn/mitolyn)

* **More Energy All Day:** Users often report steady, all-day energy without the crashes that come with coffee or caffeine pills. I definitely experienced this – I no longer hit that 2-3 PM wall and still feel alert in the late afternoon.
* **Boosted Metabolism:** This formula contains natural ingredients (like Amla, Schisandra, and raw cacao) that can support a healthy metabolism. In practice, I found that Mitolyn helped me burn a few extra calories during workouts, and my weight loss efforts felt easier.
* **Sharper Focus & Mood:** By optimizing mitochondria, Mitolyn seems to enhance mental clarity. I felt more focused at work and generally in a better mood. It’s subtle, but noticeable compared to before.
* **Supports Fat Loss:** I didn’t drop 10 pounds overnight (nothing works that fast!), but over a month I lost a noticeable amount of stubborn belly fat. Mitolyn helped curb late-night cravings and gave me more motivation to stay active.
* **Gentle on the Body:** Unlike strong stimulants, this supplement gave me energy without jitters or a racing heart. I had no major side effects – maybe a tiny bit of stomach “awake-ness” the first few days, which is normal as your body adjusts. Other than that, no issues. It’s made in FDA-registered, GMP-certified labs with clean ingredients, so the quality is high.

# My Experience with Mitolyn

I’ve tried dozens of supplements over the years, and honestly I was skeptical. But after using **Mitolyn Support Plus** daily for a month (just one capsule each morning with water), I can say the results surprised me. In week 1, I simply felt less groggy in the mornings. By week 2, I had noticeably more endurance at the gym and more energy to handle a busy day.

For example, I used to take two cups of coffee to get through work, but with Mitolyn I’m fine with one. I have consistent energy from morning until evening, and I even started jogging after dinner (something I rarely did before). This product didn’t magically melt fat off me, but it made it much easier to stick to healthier habits. I was snacking less because I wasn’t always tired and hungry, and I began losing weight gradually without feeling drained.

Many people online (forums, blogs, etc.) share similar stories: they feel a **“clean energy”** – alert but calm. One friend of mine described it as a **steady buzz** of energy without the jitters. That matches my experience exactly. I *feel more like myself* again, just charged up instead of exhausted. It’s an everyday boost, not a rollercoaster ride.

# Key Benefits of Mitolyn

Mitolyn’s formula is built around nutrient boosters for your cells, especially the mitochondria (the “power plants” in our bodies). In practice, this translates to benefits like those I observed:

* **Sustained Energy:** Mitolyn helps you feel energetic all day. No midday crash. I stopped relying on sugary snacks or extra coffee to get through the afternoon.
* **Increased Endurance:** I noticed workouts felt more doable. I wasn’t as wiped out after a run or gym session. This kept the momentum going so I could burn more calories over time.
* **Improved Focus & Mood:** A tired body often means a foggy brain. With Mitolyn, I felt mentally sharper. Tasks at work got done faster, and I was more positive and productive.
* **Natural Ingredients:** Everything in here – Amla (Indian gooseberry), Schisandra, cacao extract, Maqui berry, Rhodiola, and algae (astaxanthin) – is plant-based. They’re known to support metabolism, antioxidants, and stress management. Together they help your body produce more **ATP** (the energy currency of cells) and recover better.
* **Fat-Burning Support:** By revving up your metabolism at the cellular level, Mitolyn can help your body burn fat more efficiently. I personally found my clothes fitting a bit looser after a few weeks. It’s not a magic bullet, but it definitely gave a *metabolic edge*.

# Ingredients & How It Works

Mitolyn stands out because it targets the **root causes** of low energy and slow fat loss. Instead of acting like a quick caffeine shot, it **improves your cellular energy production**. Key ingredients include:

* **Amla (Emblica officinalis):** A superfruit rich in antioxidants that helps regulate fat metabolism and supports healthy blood sugar and cholesterol.
* **Schisandra Chinensis:** An adaptogenic berry. It helps the body handle stress and improve endurance, so you can work out or stay active longer.
* **Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa Extract):** The source of dark chocolate benefits. It contains flavonoids that improve circulation and gently boost energy and mood.
* **Maqui Berry:** A potent berry from Chile, high in anthocyanins. It’s believed to help activate brown-fat-like pathways and improve insulin sensitivity. Research on animals shows it can reduce weight gain on a high-fat diet.
* **Rhodiola Rosea:** A well-known adaptogen for stress and stamina. It may improve exercise performance and metabolic function. Studies suggest it helps improve how your body uses glucose and lipids.
* **Astaxanthin (Haematococcus algae):** A very strong antioxidant that protects cells (including mitochondria) from damage. It’s linked to better cell health and recovery.

Together, these ingredients **wake up your mitochondria**. In simpler terms, Mitolyn helps your cells make and use energy more efficiently. That’s why you feel more energetic and why your metabolism seems to get a boost.

# Side Effects & Safety

One of the best things about Mitolyn is that it’s **non-stimulant**. I didn’t experience any jitters, heart racing, or crashes like with a big cup of coffee. The formula is stimulant-free. The only mild issue some people mention is a temporary tummy rumble as their body adjusts (I had a tiny bit the first couple of days, then it went away). Other than that, no major side effects.

It’s made in FDA-registered, GMP-certified facilities, which is reassuring. Of course, I’m not a doctor – just a real user – so if you have any health conditions or concerns, it’s always good to consult a professional before adding new supplements. But for most healthy adults, Mitolyn appears safe and well-tolerated.

# Who Should Try Mitolyn?

Based on my experience, Mitolyn is perfect if you:

* Feel constantly tired or burned out, even after getting enough sleep.
* Struggle to lose weight despite diet and exercise.
* Hit an afternoon slump and find it hard to get through your day.
* Want a natural boost without caffeine or harsh stimulants.
* Have tried other energy or fat-burning supplements that left you wired or let down.

Basically, if **low energy and slow metabolism** are your struggle, Mitolyn might be worth a try. It’s aimed at anyone who feels like they have to work twice as hard as others to see results – it was exactly what I needed.

# Conclusion – Does Mitolyn Work?

In the end, my honest answer is **Yes, Mitolyn works** (for me and many others). It’s not an instant miracle – you won’t lose 20 pounds in a week – but consistent use made a real difference in my energy, workouts, and overall progress. I felt more **balanced and lively** day-to-day, and I started seeing the payoff of my efforts more clearly.

If you decide to try it, pair it with healthy habits (good diet, regular exercise) for the best outcome. Mitolyn also comes with a money-back guarantee if it doesn’t work for you, so it’s pretty low-risk. I genuinely recommend giving it a shot. My one-month experience was positive, and I plan to keep it around for days I need an extra edge.

If you want to check it out or grab a bottle, head to the official Mitolyn website here: [Mitolyn Official Site](https://bestad.link/mitolyn/mitolyn). It’s where I got mine, and they often have deals or bundles that can save you money.

**Hope this helps!** Feel free to ask any more questions about my Mitolyn experience. Good luck on your health journey – remember, consistency and small changes add up over time!",3,1749829546.0,SmartChainGems,1,1.0,False

I don’t remember exactly when my body stopped aching from tireless nights spent on the cold, hard floors, but it seems I’ve become accustomed to it. It’s comforting almost. I could probably afford a mattress by now, but I choose not to. It makes me feel like I’m in control of my life. Like I wasn’t forced to run away from home, from everything I’ve ever known and start again from nothing. It's my choice to sleep on the floor. It's been five years since I started running. It was my eighteenth birthday, and my father gave me no choice but to flee. Five different cities, all of which had ended with my brother’s and father tracking me down and almost catching me. This time I was able to secure a shitty apartment in an awful neighborhood quickly. It has four walls, a roof, a floor and a lockable door and that was all I needed right now. It's a much better position than I'd be in any other time I had to restart. I've slept on park benches and eaten out of bins. I've begged for change on the streets just to get by. I was making progress finally having a small place to crawl back to at the end of each shitty day. Id grown to liking this city, but nothing ever lasts long.



I had to get the first bus out of there after I spotted my brother’s standing by the car I’d bought out the front of the motel I had been staying at. It was a stupid mistake on my part thinking I could have a car in my name without them tracking it to my location. I was meant to be doing a shift at Thrive that evening. A strip club where I’d landed a job dancing and occasionally bartending. Instead, I walked out that morning to find my father’s pride and joys leaning against my car so casually waiting for me to admit defeat and hand myself over to them. Of course, I did no such thing and took off running before they could see me.



I ran forty minutes to Thrive, which painfully would have taken me only 15 minutes in the car. The whole reason I wanted the stupid liability in the first place. I just needed to get my last paycheck before I skipped town, so I had something this time around to start with. By the time I got there my feet were a mess from running barefoot. Usually, I would have carried my death trap high heels to the car and put them on once I’d clocked in, but I didn’t have that luxury this time.



I’d gotten there late for my shift and a complete mess, but thankfully the manager, Stacy took one look at me and knew something was wrong. I hadn’t told her anything too personal before, but she knew I was in a bad position when I’d first stumbled into the bar asking for a job. I had oversized filthy clothes and a serious matte in my hair from not owning a brush. My shoes were falling apart, and I was so skinny at the time. She took pity on me saying that we’d all been there once and everyone deserved a chance. She taught me how to dance, gave me some of her old outfits and let me crash on her couch for a while once she learned id had nowhere to go. Later she helped me secure a place of my own at the back of a motel and I had saved up enough for a cheap, shitty car. Things were going to well, until my past came back to bite me in the ass.



When I came stumbling into Thrive that night apologizing for being late, Stacy just silently pointed me to her office.



“I’m sorry I’m late, I can’t do my shift either…I just need the weeks pay and I’ve got to go” I said.



“Look darling, I’ve never pried before and I’m not going to start now. I can see you’ve been through some shit and you were in a real bad way when you first got to town so as your friend I’ve got to ask, where are you going to go?”



I took a long breath before saying, “I don’t know”.



“And how are you going to get there?”



“…I don’t know, a bus maybe?”



“And where will you be staying?”



“I don’t know! Look Stacy I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, but this is really time sensitive. I just need the pay, and I need to go.”



“Okay, just slow down love. I get it. I've known runners before. Someone for some reason has found you and you've got to move on, but I can't just let you run off into the wind not knowing anything about where you're going to go. We're friends, okay? I like you and I can help, so I will help. Let me make a phone call to my brother, he owns the club and has plenty of them in different places. We’ll get you transferred to a different club so you can keep earning money, then we’ll sort out a bus ticket and somewhere to stay.”



“You’re not going to ask why I’m leaving?”



“No. In my family, we’re raised not to ask questions we probably don’t want to know the answers to.”



I sat back and waited while Stacy made a phone call to her brother. It seemed like he also didn't ask many questions because it only took a few minutes before she hung up and told me he'd be happy to transfer me immediately and I could start tomorrow. She gave me my weeks' pay, drove me to the bus stop, kissed my cheek goodbye and that was that. It was time to run again. Hopefully her brother is as nice as her.



# Satisfy



It took 8 hours to get here on the bus and by the time I arrived, it was early morning. Id rushed to the club she had me transferred to, Satisfy, so I could fill out some paperwork and get myself on their roster. Thankfully Stacy’s brother had told the manager Kevin that I wouldn’t be going on the payroll and instead I’d be getting cash just like Stacy had been doing for me. It was a relief really; I didn’t need a paper trail, and I didn’t want people asking questions why. Kevin had me put on the roster for that same evening, so I had more than enough time to find the hotel id organized and be able to shower and eat something before my shift started.



“Okay well, welcome to Satisfy! I’m thankful Luciano had you transferred here. We just lost three of our best girls so we’re extremely short staffed now”. He had said. He seemed nice enough. Short, dirty blond hair, medium build and a smile that somehow told me his mother must love him really well.



“Hmmm” I hummed in response. I wanted to be polite but at the same time I didn’t like having to divulge any unnecessary information if I didn’t need to. It was safer that way really.



“Okay great, all the paperwork is done so if you want to meet back here at seven, we can get you sorted out with a wardrobe, have a walkthrough and get you on the stage by eight”.



“A wardrobe? I have a few pieces of my own…”



“Oh no, just come in your own normal clothes, Luciano likes to give each girl their own wardrobe with everything they need.”



“Oh, okay, sure then, I’ll see you at seven... Thanks.”



Luciano was Stacy’s brother, who id learned owned over 20 clubs across the country that he had managed mostly by family, but this one, this one was his. Stacy had told me when she had called him, he was more than happy to have me transferred and needed me to be at the club he managed personally. I thought it was odd at first. Why not send me to any of the others? But I guess if Kevin was saying they were short staffed, that made sense. It was convenient for him.



Id managed my way to the hotel. I had just enough money for a week’s stay, that was if I didn’t spend any of it anywhere else. Which meant that the complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits in my room were going to be the only thing I would be eating for a while. That didn’t bother me too much, my body was used to running on less than what was deemed a normal amount of food. I took one of the sugar packets and sat down on the musty brown comforter on top of the hard bed. I’d have to go slow with what I had supplied so for now I figured a sugar packet would suffice until I’d finished my shift tonight. Maybe then I’d treat myself to one of the four biscuit packets. I tore off the top of the sugar packet, not caring about letting the rubbish fall to the floor. It didn’t look like the place was very clean to begin with, so I didn’t think it really mattered. Letting the sugar fall onto my tongue I let it rest there while it dissolved. A trick id learned from when I was younger, being locked in my room for days on end by my father with no food or water. Occasionally one of the staff that worked in the home would slide something under the door. It had always had to be small enough to fit through the sliver of space. Usually, a squashed piece of bread or candy. I learned quickly to eat little bits over a long period of time and to let it sit on my tongue so I could trick my brain into thinking I had more food than I did.



Shivering off the memory I made my way into the dimly lit bathroom connected to my room. It wasn’t much, but it did come with some soap and shampoo that I knew I desperately needed. I turned on the water and let it steam up before I stepped in, hissing as the water hit the tender spots on my feet from running without shoes. I used all the tiny shampoo that didn’t do much but made my hair feel dry and tangled. The soap was even worse, making my skin feel like rubber, but it did take off the stench id acquired, and I could at least be thankful for that. Hoping out of the shower and using the slightly stained towel to dry off, I used my fingers to comb through the mess of my hair and made my way over to the bag of things I’d managed to get from Thrive before I left. I couldn’t go back and get anything from my motel room there so I would have to make do with a pair of my stripper bottoms and the clothes id already been wearing. I guess it was a good thing Kevin mentioned I’d be getting a wardrobe at the club. Maybe there would be some stuff I could use until I had a bit of cash to buy some secondhand clothes.



It was just after 6 when I’d decided to have another sugar packet before grabbing my purse and leaving for the club. I’d need a little bit of energy to walk there and get the shift done. “Lilly! You’re early” Kevin said as id entered the club’s main doors. The place was still quiet, with just a few staff members looking to be setting up for the night.



“Uh yeah sorry, I didn’t know how long it would take me to get here so I figured it be best to be early rather than late.”



“No that’s fine, we can get started with your wardrobe, meet the other girls and get you ready for tonight if you’d like.”



# Pure, dark, violence



We walked past the bar to the back of the club, Kevin pointing out different things as we went.



“We’ll do a proper walkthrough once we’ve got you set up but this here” he said as he pointed to a keypad by a red door. “This is for the girls only, of course with me and Luciano as an expectation.”



He showed me the pin and we walked into the room. It was much bigger than the changing rooms at Thrive. It has a thick, plush red carpet and black walls. Mirrors and makeup tables lined the walls, and a few girls were already seated and fixing themselves. I’m glad I’m not the only one who likes to be early.



“Hey! Ohhhh is this the new girl you were telling me about Kevin!?”



This blonde barbie looking explosion was bouncing out of her seat and practically skipping her way over in 8-inch pink stilettos. How she was even managing not to break her neck was beyond me. She had on a two piece bright pink leather bra and short shorts. Her breasts looked as though they might bounce up into her face and knock her out. Her platinum blond hair was pulled back into a high ponytail and she had makeup that made her look somewhat innocent if you didn’t look below her shoulders at the rest of her outfit.



“I’m Candy!” she said as she pulled me in for a hug that honestly felt like I should be paying for with how much I could feel her breasts pushing up against me.



“Is that because you’re all sweet and bubbly and shit?” I said before I could even register the blatantly rude tone I was using.



“Ha! Exactly, sweet like Candy and they all want a taste” she said giving me a wink.



“So, what’s your name?”



“Oh sorry, Lilly” I said giving off a half smile.



“Nooo, girly you need a stage name! Lord knows my parents would never have named me Candy. We pick a stage name to protect ourselves from any creepers trying to weasel into our outside lives.”



“Oh, well I don’t have one.”



I didn’t need to tell her Lilly wasn’t even my real name so I never really thought it mattered if I used it in the clubs. If anyone ever tried to find me with that name, they wouldn’t. I made sure of that.



“Didn’t you get transferred here from another club?”



“Yeah?”



“So how did you protect yourself from creeps? What would have happened if someone used your name to say find out where you lived?”



“Oh well if anyone was a ‘creep’ I’d just punch them in the balls, poke my fingers in their eyes or snap their arm or something” I said shrugging my shoulders.



Candys eyes went wide, Kevin visibly stiffened beside me, and I only just realized what I had said was definitely not a normal statement from a 5ft nothing female who was meant to be dainty and seductive.



After what felt like an eternity but was probably just a minute of holding my breath, she laughed, like she really laughed. Bent over, holding her stomach laughing. Wiping a stray tear from her eye before it could ruin her perfectly set face she said, “Okay, so your stage name from here on out will be Violence” she said with a wicked grin.



Yep, I like this girl. After Candy shooed Kevin off, telling him the girls could handle it from here, I met the others and was shown to my own table. It had everything I’d need, all brand-new, high-end products. Candy explained how Luciano made sure every girl here was well taken care of with what they needed to look the part. Then she showed me to the wardrobes which were conveniently placed in between each table along the wall. Each girl got their own walk-in wardrobe that I swear was just as big as my current hotel room. It had the same red carpet and black walls with golden features and floor to ceiling on all four walls were lined with clothes, shoes and accessories. Everything looked new with price tags and after further inspection it was all in my size. From the breast cups down to the shoes.



“Haha, yeah, I looked just like that when I first saw my wardrobe. Everything here is handpicked for you, usually by Kevin, he has excellent taste and a way of reading what a girl’s style is.”



“Kevin picked all this out for me?”



“Well, no, not exactly” she said with not even a hint of trying to hide her amusement. “I was told your wardrobe was handpicked by Luciano.”



Why the hell would Luciano do this for me? How would he even know my sizes? I haven’t even met the man. I’m just some pity case his sister asked him to take on and he’s spent all this money and bought all these things with me in mind? That doesn’t make any sense...



As if she couldn’t tell or didn’t care for my internal brain battle, Candy grabbed my hand and squealed. Causing me to shift back into focus and squint my eyes at the blonde bubble of energy who was now pulling things out left right and center and pushing them up to my body. No doubt trying to picture what I’d look like in each piece.



“Okay yesssss! This is it, put this one on” she said holding up a black leather corset and underwear.



After id slipped into the outfit, I matched it with a pair of sturdy black heels that laced up around my calves and a black leather chocker that looked slightly more like a collar but fit the look I was going with. Candy helped do my long black hair into a slicked back, high ponytail and finished off with a smokey eye and a bit of blush and mascara. She said I didn’t need much makeup because my skin was flawless as it was, and she only wanted to enhance a few of my features like my electric blue eyes and soft pink lips.



“Oh dang girl, you really did a number on her Candy. The men will eat her up. You’re going to have some competition now.” One of the other girls, Ruby, had said as she stood behind us in the floor to ceiling mirror. Looking back at myself I was shocked. I mean I had outfits from Stacy and dressed up every night I worked at Thrive, but they were all her style. This, what I was seeing, this was me, pure, dark, violence.



# Don't Be Nervous



The club was starting to liven up now, the music blasting, the lights flashing and people started flowing in through the doors. A strong smell of cigarettes and alcohol wafting through the air and a hum went through me from the bass of the music. Kevin told all of the girls where their stages were, and they all politely waved as they made their way out.



“Where do you want me?” I asked as I wasn’t yet given a stage to go to.



“You, my dear Violence have been requested to the VIP area by Luciano.”



“The VIP? Isn’t that usually reserved for the most experienced girls? I’ve only worked with Stacy for a couple of months, and I mean, I know what I’m doing but I’m sure of one the other girls here would be much better suited to your VIP customers.”



“Woah, slow down there, I can practically see your head spinning. Stacy already told us your experience, but she also told us you’re an absolute wonder on stage like you were born to be there. I’m sure Luciano just wants to get to know his newest girl. Come on, I’m sure you’ll do great. Plus, the customers up there give the best tips”. He said with a wink while holding out his arm to escort me to the top floor. I could use the tips, the two sugar packets id had in the last 24 hours weren’t doing me much good and I would eventually need to use some money for food and a backup plan. If there's anything I've learned over these last five years, its to always have a backup plan. In the beginning it was things like another park or bench to sleep on, scraps of food saved or a plan of the bus routes and towns. Since Stacy gave me the job in the last city though and I've had the taste of having a nice-ish place to sleep, I'm thinking a little bigger and I'd like to have enough money sitting aside for when I move again to get another apartment, clothes, toiletries, food, you know, the basics.



The stairs leading to the VIP section has a security guard at the bottom, he unclipped the rope and nodded to us to proceed up. I noticed the change in scenes almost immediately from the rest of the club. The main floor was packed with people now, it was brightly colored and energetic. I’m sure the flashing lights and rowdy customers would have quickly given me a headache. The top floor though, it was closed off from the rest of the club. Kevin showed me the pin to the door at the top of the staircase and when he opened it for me it was like stepping onto a completely different place. The music wasn’t as loud, still prominent but you wouldn’t have to yell over it. The lighting was dim but steady and the features of the room were mostly dark wood and black with a hint of gold and red. I stood next to Kevin, scanning the room, focusing on the stage at the back, it was large enough that I wouldn’t have to rely on the pole the whole time like at Thrive. This one had enough space that if I chose to, I could dance around it comfortably. True to the theme it had a golden pole, red lighting and dark wood making up the stage. I took a step towards its direction, ready to shut out the world and lose myself in the music with the promise of some easy cash, but Kevin placed his hand atop of mine on his arm before I could remove it. Giving him what I could only hope was a polite, questioning gaze he leaned closer to whisper in my ear. “The boss wanted to meet you before you get started. Don’t be nervous.”



Yes, because that’s what I needed not to be nervous I thought as my eyes snapped to the table to the right of the stage where Kevin was leading us now. Six large, well dressed, dangerous looking males were sat, all their eyes focused on me as we walked over. I was thankful now for the grip I had on Kevin’s arm as I’m pretty sure my stomach was ready to fall out of my ass at the sight of the largest man sat on end of the booth. He had jet black hair that was shorter on the sides and slightly longer on the top. Tattoos covered his hands and neck, I’m sure they led underneath his expensive looking suit too. I’m not even sure how his suit wasn’t tearing with how large his arms and thighs looked caressed in the material. Gold rings on his fingers were tapping mindlessly on his glass that I’m sure was filled with whisky. He looked like he’d drink whisky. He gave off a vibe that screamed Alpha male. He was dangerous and my stupid vagina couldn’t possibly understand that as it instantly heated when I finished scanning his Greek God gifted body and met his obsidian eyes. Nope, don't do that. I quickly avert my eyes and I'm met with piercing blues like mine. The man sitting next to him looks just as tall, maybe a bit leaner, blonde tussled hair and a boyish smile that makes me feel a lot more at ease. I scan the rest of the group and I swear there must be something in the dam water. Why are they all so massive? How the hell did Stacy grow up around these guys and not get pregnant? My ovaries are currently screaming at me to reproduce right now.



“Kevin” he said as his eyes flicked from mine to the male, I had forgotten I was holding on to.



“Mr Donatello, let me introduce you to your newest girl. This beauty here is Violence.""



He looks me up and down and smiles wickedly. His obsidian eyes stare straight into my soul.



# Did My Heart Just Stutter?



\*\*Luciano\*\*



“Violence…” I said with a smirk as I held my hand out to the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I didn’t bother to stand, no, that would give her an option to hesitate, and I needed her to know right from this moment that she was mine. I’ve never had my heart stutter before, being raised all my life to become what I am today never allowed for me to have such feelings. I am Don of the largest Mafia family in this country, my heart should not stutter, but this dark angel places her tiny soft hand in mine, that’s exactly what it did. I didn’t hesitate once I had her hand in mine. A slight tug and she was falling right into my arms. The hand I didn’t have a hold of came out to land softly on my shoulder and I placed the one I had on my other shoulder as I slipped my hand to the small of her back to bring her to sit on my lap in a perfect fluid motion. She's tiny against my body. Delicate, breakable but her eyes are fierce and hold a fire in them.



My sister, Stacy had told me about this girl working at one of my other clubs. She hadn’t said much, just that she appeared to be running from something or better yet, someone and needed my help to get her out of there. I initially agreed because I needed more dancers, but when I had my PI look into this girl, Lilly Ontario, he couldn’t find anything. Not a single trace of her ever existing anywhere and that intrigued me. Usually, even people under a false identity were an easy enough case for my guy but this girl has stumped him. I had called my sister back this morning after Lilly arrived to talk to Kevin. I needed to know more about her as I watched her from the security cameras in Kevin’s office. She was simply too breathtaking to just ignore. Stacy had told me about how she met her with nothing but the clothes on her back needing a job. She went on to tell me how after her first shift she had offered her a ride home as it was too late in the night to let the girl walk anywhere and when Lilly had pointed her in the direction of a park she quickly figured out where this girl has planned on sleeping and couldn’t allow it, so she took her home and let her stay on her couch for a couple of weeks until Lilly had enough cash to get a room at some shitty motel on the wrong side of town. There wasn’t much more of importance Stacy could tell me other than her clothes and shoe size and as my mind had tried to work out this pretty little anomaly I found myself at the mall picking out everything my brain could imagine her milky skin slipping in and out of. It’s usually a job I handed over to Kevin, but this girl did something to me, and I felt inclined to be the one to pick everything she would wear on that milky soft skin.



“oh... um, Mr Donatello…”



She was clearly thrown off by the sudden movements and didn't know what was happening. Good I thought, she will need to learn to trust me.



She was blushing a nice pink in her cheeks and oh man it looked so good on her. I wonder what things I could do to her to keep her blushing.



“Violence. I’m hoping you found everything you needed in the dressing room.”



“Uh yeah Sir, thank you, it was all more than enough and thank you for the club transfer.”



She was wiggling that tight little ass in my lap, no doubt nervous by my men and I, and I needed to remove her quickly before she felt how incredibly hard I was getting. That probably wouldn’t be the best first impression. Luca, my best friend and right hand was smiling at her like the bloody golden retriever he is, and she was shifting her eyes around on all of us unsure of where to look. It seems she settled on the floor. I made a note of teaching her out of that habit. This girl would learn to hold her head high in any room with me.



“Hmmm” I hummed. “Let’s get you situated on the stage then. My sister has asked that I take good care of you, so whenever you work here your only stage will be here in the VIP. I won’t have you downstairs with the rowdy crowd, okay?”



“Yes Sir, I understand, thank you.”



""I'm Luca by the way!"" he says as he holds out his hand.



""Are you going to swing me around and pull me onto your lap too?"" She says back with a little bite.



Luca looks at me with those stupid pleading puppy dog eyes like I might actually let him and I narrow my eyes to tell him to back off.



""Of course not, now that would be a rude way to introduce myself, wouldn't it?"" He winks and nudges me.



I roll my eyes and let the girl stand. I watch as she adjusts her outfit and steps back to Kevin.



""Ready to dance, Violence?"" Kevin says as she takes his arm again. The arm that I wish was mine. Fuck, really? Thats possessive of me...



She nods at him and they turn around towards the stage. I just sit and watch as that cute little ass struts away. Such perfect curves. I look at Luca who's doing to same thing and slap him up the back of the head.



""Hey!""



""Keep your eyes to yourself!""



""It's literally a strip club, Don and she, well she's something special to look at."" He wiggles his eyebrows and then rests his chin on his hands and continues watching her. I can't say I blame him. She really is something special.



# A Lady Doesn't Tell.



\*\*Violence.\*\*



To say that man is intimidating is a definite understatement. Stacy had asked him to take care of me though and I guess having a man like that in my corner would be a real asset. Kevin helped me onto the stage, and I was more than ready to dance. Something I figured out quickly at Thrive was that I was somewhat of a natural on stage. I was able to shut off the world, turn on my blinders and feel the music as if I was the only person in the room. I transported from this world where I was a pathetic run away with nothing to my name, to another where I was a powerful force of seductive and sexual energy, a goddess of the night where men would bow before me to witness my enchantments. I took a deep breath as the song finished and I run one hand up the cold metal of the pole. Closing my eyes I hear the beat of the music begin and I imagine that I transform myself into a flame dancing around with the fire that burns within my soul.



After about three hours Kevin comes back to let me know it’s time for break. He lets me know I can head down to the dressing room to eat if I wish, but obviously I didn’t bring anything and I think he already knew that.



“Well, there’s a two-drink limit when you’re working, but they’re on the house. You’re more than welcome to stay up here at the bar and you’ll find some fruit we usually use for the drinks in the mini fridge. We rarely ever use them so you’re welcome to those too.”



“Thanks” I mumble, half embarrassed and swallowing my pride as I tell him I’ll take him up on the offer.



I pour myself a rum and coke and slice an orange that literally has my mouth watering at this point. The rum is refreshing and cool as it trickles down my throat. I settled in on one of the stools as I tried to zone out the room.



“Hey, Violence, right?”



I hear a gentleman to my right say as he walks closer and gestures to the seat beside me. He was probably in his late fifty’s, well built like the rest of the men up here. There must be steroids in the water or something. If you saw him from a far, you’d probably think he had a full head of hair but as he got closer I noticed he was completely bald but instead it was tattoos that lined his head and bits of his face. His neck and hands were also inked, and he gave me the impression he could probably snap my neck in a heartbeat of he wanted to. His smile was warm though, something I wasn’t as accustomed to. Just like every other male up here his suit said, ‘I have money, a lot of fucking money’.



“Do you mind?” He gestures to the stool next to mine.



“Yes, of course, please” I say as I show that it’s fine he wishes to accompany me in my break. Which it most definitely is not. I hate small talk or talk in general. Why do you need to be here in my space? But I’m not going to say that, no, I need this job, and apparently this orange too as I can’t stop myself from devouring it. I had grown too comfortable with somewhat healthy eating habits and now I was suffering for it on the stupid two sugar packets.



“You’re an absolute dream up there darling, and your demeanor off stage too. Most girls can’t help but hang off the guys up here. Nagging in our ears and trying to get into our beds. It’s a welcome change. Something akin to how a woman should behave.”



“No offence Sir, but I couldn’t care less for your bed or the money dripping from you. I’m just here to earn my money and eat my free orange, but I will say you’re wrong if you think I behave anything like a fucking lady should”.



I couldn’t help myself. It just came out like word vomit when I should have shoved it into a mental vault and smiled ‘like a lady should’.



“Haha! He bellowed. “And a sharp tongue too. I guess that’s why they call you violence right?”



“Hmm something like that.”



“Would there possibly be another reason for the name?”



I raised my eyebrow in interest as I let the last orange skin drop down onto the plate in front of me.



“Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t. A lady doesn’t tell her secrets.”



“Well, that may be exactly what my club is looking for.”



He slides a white business card over to me discreetly and I look down to see it has nothing but an address on it. I’ve seen cards like these before, given it’s been a long time, but I would know the signs of an underground fight club anywhere. After all, my father owned one and trained me to fight before I could even walk.



“When?” that’s all I needed to know, because there was good, fast money in them and that is exactly what I needed.



“Ha, I knew I was right. I could see the fire in those eyes. Mondays and Fridays, 2am to 5am”



“And the password?”



A smirk formed across his stubble ridden face. He knew I wouldn’t be able to get in without that, but also didn’t tell me to see if I knew the way a fight club worked. Of course I knew, but I wasn’t about to divulge information I didn’t need to about how or why I knew how these things operated.



“Firefly.”



“Admission cost?”



“For you, Violence, I’ll cover your first round. You win that and you’ll have enough for a second round and some to pocket. Just tell Benji as the desk that Ronaldo has you covered.”



He finished his drink and went to leave before turning around.



“Oh, and this” he said as he pulled a stack of notes from his wallet and putting them on the bar in front of me. “This is a tip being such a lovely ‘lady’ to watch tonight.”



I nodded my head and smiled like I should have done to begin with before taking the money. I went to fold it and put it straight into the cup of my corset along with the business card, but my eyes snagged on the amount. Holy shit, there must be at least $500 here. I’m definitely eating all those biscuits tonight. If this man’s fight club was anything like my dad’s, then maybe I could get on my feet faster than I thought.



# Don First.



The rest of my shift went by really quick, and I managed to get a butt ton of tips although I hadn’t had a chance to count how much yet but by the feeling of how full my cups were, it’s more than enough to call this a running start. Id noticed Luciano’s eyes on me most of the night, which kept pulling my attention to him, but I guess every man up here was obviously going to stare at the seductively dressed female dancing on a stripper pole. I also kept getting overly excited looks from his friend Luca. That almost threw me off from the mask I was wearing a few times. He's got that contagious sort of smile that makes you want to smile back. I headed to the dressing room and told the girls about my night. Candy asked if I needed a lift home, but I politely denied, lying through my teeth that I had a lift. I do not need people getting close. I take what I need and nothing more, that's the safest option for everyone. When all the girls left, I made my way into my wardrobe to find my discarded outfit from earlier today but I promptly noted that there seemed to be a section of clothes that looked like everyday wear. Although it was odd that the owner of a club would provide normal clothes for the girls, I was extremely thankful and snagged a fresh pair of jeans, a white shirt and a black hoodie. Slipping out into the fresh early morning air I took out my phone to map the safest way back to the hotel. Most women would think it would be safer to take main roads with streetlights, but I knew better. Back roads, alley ways and the dark of night were my friend. I would regularly slink around in the dead of night unseen. My way of thinking was if no one knew you were there, how could they grab you?



It took half an hour on my detour route back and I immediately devoured the biscuits and started counting the tips from my night. Almost $2000, holy hell, I never made that much at Thrive. I decided that tomorrow I would try to look for a shitty apartment, hopefully one where I could pay with cash, and I’d need to find a gym to work out how rusty I had gotten fighting. Id kept up my stamina over the years, I usually liked to work out once a day to stay in shape. Usually at parks because it is free, but I would need a bag to gain back some muscle memory before Monday. Two days’ prep would have to be enough.



Having sorted out my plan for tomorrow I decided to pull the comforter off the bed to the floor where I know I would feel safer. I always felt safer there.



\*\*Luciano\*\*



I sat with my men in the VIP section of the club most of the night. We had plenty to discuss with upcoming shipments and deals and when we were through with that I asked about my men’s families. Family was very important to us. I was raised alongside these guys. Our parents treated us all like siblings and would always remain close. I watched over Violence all night while talking with my guys. I was trying to be discreet about it, Luca was not, and I wanted to stay until her shift ended so I could ask to drive her back to wherever she was staying. Kevin hadn’t been able to get much personal information from her this morning when going through the paperwork with her and when he’d asked for a home address, she’s merely told him she didn’t have one yet. When he asked then for the address of where she would be staying, she told him that she had not yet checked into a hotel but would happily update him with that information when she had. By now she should have checked in somewhere so I wanted to drive her after her shift so I knew exactly where I could find my little angel.



My friend Matteo had gotten a phone call an hour before the club would close for the night. He excused himself to take it in my office off the side of the VIP section and when he came back, the look on his face told me it was going to be an even longer night.



“Boss, we just got word there’s been a sighting of Angelo near your sister’s club.”



“Well I guess we had better head there and check it out then.”



Angelo Salvatore was number one on our hit list and had been ever since he put my father six feet under 5 years ago. They had a meeting to discuss a possible alliance with gun trades but instead that idiot put a bullet in the back of his head before he even knew it was coming. He’s somehow been evading my men and I ever since. As much as I wanted to stay and make sure Violence got home safe, I needed to be Don first. Downing the last of our drinks, my men and I headed out for the night to travel the 8 hours to my sister's club. Maybe I could even get some more information of my little angel while I'm there. We took a few cars, leaving some men behind with Tony to look after things here while we were gone. If we could get a lead on Angelo I'd follow it like a hound. I've dedicated my life to killing him, my men have too. You don't just kill a Don and get away with it. I will follow him to the pits of hell if I have to just to get revenge for what he's done. He's like a bloody cockroach though and every time we get even the slightest tip of where he is, he's gone.",1,1749829427.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Life at times is predictable,and the whole objective is to make it consistently predictable so that the chaos doesn't smash you black and blue .
The days when things are monotonous, and you wish you can do more than doom scrolling, you go out. 
Unlike any other vacation,where you are glued to screen, this hits different. You don't want to update any with the news,and have no purpose to remember this moment. You just want to live them. 
You walk down the beach, dip yourself in it, the sand grains drown in your crevices. 
You do it as long as you can without a purpose until you are drained. You sit on a beach, maybe sip a drink, have a conversation if you have people around. See how kids scream,giggle and cherish their smiles. 
You see an old couple having a coffee together,and a dog trying to gather the fish. It's a regular day,but not for you. These details aren't captured in any devices,and maybe,you might not even remember the details, but you don't care. 
This is a retreat to your inner self and hopefully one fine day you'll find bits and pieces of you scattered in the beaches, mountains, rivers and mostly places you call home.

# Chapter 1

Because my five-year-old twin daughters upset Liam Sterling’s beloved, he sent them to an extreme disciplinary school. The teachers from the school stormed into our home, trying to forcefully take them away. My two daughters clung to the car door, crying and shouting for their father. I knelt on the ground, pleading desperately.

""They're only five years old. They're still so young! Sending them to that place will kill them. I'm their mother. If anyone failed to teach them properly, it’s me. Punish me instead…”

Liam, however, stood there with his beloved in his arms, watching us coldly.

""If you hadn’t spoiled them so much, they wouldn’t have turned out this way—disrespectful and arrogant! I’m their father, and if you can’t teach them, then I’ll do it. Do you think I would harm them?""

The next day, I went to the school with my sister-in-law Sophie, only to find our daughters covered in bruises, already lifeless.

But Liam... he was celebrating on social media, announcing that his beloved was pregnant with his child.

I stared blankly at Sophie.

""My children are dead. I have nothing left. Please, let me go. I don’t want anything anymore.""

When we arrived at the hospital, the children already had no vital signs. They were so far gone that they didn’t even make it into the emergency room before being taken to the morgue.

Sophie looked at me with pity, but she still spoke softly, trying to comfort me.

""It’s okay, don’t worry. Grandpa and I are on your side. This time, my brother was wrong. I will make him apologize to you. You’ll be fine from now on...""

Before Sophie could finish her sentence, I handed her my phone.

Liam had posted a status just two hours ago.

""Before you even came into this world, your mother and I had already begun loving you.""

The post was accompanied by a picture of an ultrasound report, clearly marked with the name ""Vivian Cole,"" showing she was six weeks pregnant.

Vivian... Liam's beloved.

Sophie froze, her face flushing with anger as she spoke through clenched teeth.

""I’ll call my brother right now. Don’t worry, we will make sure we get justice for you...""

I smiled bitterly and immediately called Liam. The moment the phone connected, his impatient voice rang through.

""Are you trying to tell me that the kids were abused at school again? Who dares to hurt my children? Stop playing the victim. I just sent them to learn some discipline. Why do you keep calling me? You really disgust me.""

I didn’t say a word, and Liam hung up immediately.

I had the phone on speaker, and his cruel words echoed in Sophie’s ears. Her face turned pale, and her lips trembled, as if she didn’t know how to comfort me anymore.

I forced a smile, but tears streamed down my face,uncontrollable.

""Please, I have nothing left. Let me go. I can't take it anymore.""

Before Sophie could say anything, two police officers appeared in front of us.

""Are you the family of the deceased? The head of the school has already been detained. We need your cooperation with the investigation.""

When I entered the police station, I saw the men who had come to our house the day before to take the children.

In that instant, I lost all control, screaming and crying as I lunged at them.

“You monsters! You fucking monsters! They were five years old! How could you do this to them? How could you?!”

The police quickly pulled me away, and Sophie hugged me tightly, trying to keep me calm.

“Juliette, please—the police will handle this. We won’t let them get away with it!”

The men seemed to shrink in fear, glancing at each other as they sneered.

“Maybe if you’d raised them right, this wouldn’t have happened.”

“That’s just how we teach kids at our school. Spare the rod, spoil the child. Who knew your brats were so weak? What a fucking waste—”

My fingers shook as I pointed at them, my anger building up like a ticking bomb. I wanted to tear them apart!

A sharp taste of blood rose in my throat, and I vomited a mouthful of blood. Everything went black.

When I woke up, I was in the Sterling family mansion and Sophie was sitting by my bedside, her eyes red from crying.

""Juliette, you’re awake? Don’t worry, we’ve already handled things with the police. We won’t let those monsters get away with it!""

I stared blankly at the ceiling.

""Please, let me go. I have nothing left...""

# Chapter 2

I knew in my heart that the men at the school were guilty, but ultimately, it was Liam who had sent our daughters to that hellish place. The true culprit wasn’t those men, but their biological father, Liam.

Sophie flinched, then, as if making a decision, spoke softly.

""Alright, I’ll go tell Grandpa.""

As I watched Sophie walk away, I couldn’t hold back my tears any longer. It felt as though I was crying away all the injustice I had endured over the years.

I had come to the Sterling family when I was eight, the same age as Liam. Mr. Sterling and my grandfather had been comrades-in-arms, and my grandfather had saved Mr. Sterling’s life on the battlefield. They had a bond of life and death.

I had lost both my parents shortly after I was born, and I was raised by my grandfather. But when he passed away, Mr. Sterling took me in.

Over the years, Mr. Sterling and Sophie had treated me as family, genuinely accepting me as one of their own. So, even though Liam was a jerk, I stayed at the family home for seven years, gave birth to his children, and took care of the household.

I had thought that, even if I wasn’t loved, my life had meaning as long as I had my two precious daughters.

But now, I had nothing.

Some time later, Sophie returned to my room.

“Grandpa wants to see you.”

When I walked into Mr. Sterling’s room, he was sitting on a chair by the bed, looking at me with deep pity.

""My dear, you’re such a good girl. I’ve heard from Sophie about all the suffering you’ve been through these years.Tomorrow, the children will be cremated. After it’s over, if you want to leave, then go. That damn son doesn’t deserve you. He shouldn’t have wasted your time.""

I didn’t say a word, but bowed deeply to Mr. Sterling.

As I bent over, tears dropped to the floor like stones. I was grateful, so grateful for their care over the past twenty years. But I could never forgive Liam—the man who had killed my children.

When I returned to my room, Liam was already waiting there. As soon as he saw me, a sneer appeared on his face.

""Well, what is it? Can’t wait to go back and complain to Grandpa? Juliette, do you really think that after you’ve sweet-talked Grandpa and Sophie, I’ll stay with you and live happily ever after?""

Seeing him, my hatred flooded over me like a tidal wave. I wanted to kill him, send him straight to hell!

But then, I heard the soft voices of my children in my mind.

""Mom, we love Daddy so much. He’s the most handsome daddy at our kindergarten.""

""Mom, we miss Daddy. Will he come home today to be with us?""

""We love you, Mom, but we love Daddy second best.""

Even when I rushed to the school to save them, their last words before they lost consciousness were still:

""Mom, please don’t fight with Dad because of us. It’s our fault, we weren’t good... we didn’t listen...""

I took a deep breath, ignoring Liam, and sat down by the bed.

When I didn’t speak, Liam grew angry, grabbing me and throwing me onto the bed. He pinned my hands above my head.

""Now what’s this about? Didn’t you tell Sophie to call me back?""

As he spoke, he leaned down to kiss me, but I couldn’t fight back. I could only bite down on his lip hard.

Liam winced in pain and pulled back, sitting up.

""Juliette! Have you lost your mind? Seeing you like this disgusts me. You must have used that sweet, innocent face to deceive Grandpa, didn’t you? You tricked me into coming back and now you’re playing hard to get? Pathetic. And it’s because of your weak parenting that our daughters turned out so—”

I bit my lip until I tasted blood. Then, softly, I cut him off.

""The children are dead.""

# Chapter 3

Liam’s expression suddenly tightened, and after a brief moment, he scoffed.

""Juliette, you really have no shame. Is this what you’re going to say? You only just found out that Vivi is pregnant, and now you’re making up all these lies?""

After saying this, Liam stood up and walked straight to the door.

Just as he reached the doorway, he paused.

""It’s your own choice, so don’t go whining to Grandpa about how I’ve neglected you. That’ll just make me hate you more.""

Once Liam left, the room grew quiet again. I rushed into the bathroom, scrubbing my teeth furiously, trying to wash away the lingering taste of Liam’s kiss.

Liam and I had once been in love. On the day of my coming-of-age ceremony, eighteen-year-old Liam stood before me, his ears flushed red.

""Juliette , I want to take care of you. I don’t want to just be your brother anymore…”

His cheeks were tinged pink, but his eyes were full of determination, captivating me completely. My heart melted in that moment.

For the following years, Liam treated me like I was the most precious thing in the world, and I did the same, giving him everything I had.

Until that day, when Mr. Sterling called us into his office.

""You’re both of marriageable age now, Juliette . Your grandfather saved my life and I wouldn’t trust you to just anyone. What do you think of Liam?” From that point on, Liam’s attitude toward me changed drastically. The love and tenderness we had shared seemed to vanish overnight.

I had no idea what had happened, and Liam never told me why.

A year into our marriage, I became pregnant. But from then on, Liam barely came home, flaunting his affairs with Vivian in public without shame.

I confronted him, screamed at him—but he only ever looked at me with disgust, as if I were some deranged lunatic.

“You got what you wanted—you’re Mrs. Sterling now, you’ve given the family heirs. What more are you whining about? Stop playing the victim. It makes me sick.”

From that moment, I stopped asking him for explanations. I focused on taking care of our two children.

I accepted the truth—Liam didn’t love me, nor did he love our children. But at least I was lucky that the kids were well-behaved. I thought that if I could just grow old with them, I would be happy.

But now, I had lost them as well.

The next morning, the children were cremated and buried. I stood outside the funeral home, holding two tiny urns in my arms.

They were so small when they were born, quietly lying in my arms. How had five years passed, and they had become even smaller and lighter?

My eyes stung with tears, but I bit my lip to hold them back.

Sophie looked at me with deep concern.

""If it hurts, just cry. Don’t hold it in.""

I didn’t respond to Sophie. Instead, I looked toward Mr. Sterling, who was preparing to leave for the cemetery.

""Grandpa, the children won’t be buried in the Sterling family tomb. I’m changing their last names. They aren’t Sterlings—they’re mine.”

Mr. Sterling gave me a long, hard look before his anger flared.

""Where is that ungrateful bastard? How dare he skip their funeral!”

Sophie glanced at me nervously and whispered, ""His phone’s off. We can’t reach him.""

Closing his eyes briefly, Mr. Sterling exhaled before nodding at me.

""They are your children, born after you risked your life. Do as you wish.""

The Sterlings had raised me. I owed them everything.

But my children owed them nothing. I wouldn’t let them suffer even in death.

After Grandpa left, Sophie gently called me.

"". Juliette...""

I smiled at her, holding the two urns tightly as I took a cab straight back home.

I needed to take the children’s things as well. That house was never a home. I didn’t want them staying in that cold, empty house.

But as soon as I opened the door, the sounds of a man and woman moaning in pleasure filled my ears.

""Oh, the doctor said we shouldn’t… I’m pregnant…”

# Chapter 4

The man’s voice was hoarse, filled with desire.

""I’ll be gentle. It’s fine, sweetheart. How could I hurt our baby?""

Moments later, the sounds of their passionate intimacy echoed through the house.

They were in the bedroom, lost in their embrace. I couldn’t bring myself to go in and pack. I stood there, at the door, listening to those unbearable sounds, torturing myself.

I didn’t know how long it had been, but eventually, the two of them finally walked out of the bedroom.

The moment Vivian saw me, her eyes gleamed with triumph.

“Oh, Juliette! You’re back? Why didn’t you say anything? Liam just couldn’t help himself—what could I do?”

Liam stood beside Vivian, his arm wrapped around her waist.

""Why bother explaining to her? She’s nobody. Let’s go. We have a check-up with the doctor today. Our baby’s health comes first.”

Not once did Liam look at me. His eyes were only on Vivian.

I stepped aside, quietly making way for them.

As they passed me, Liam finally noticed the two urns I was holding.

""What’s that trash you’re holding? Toss it out—it’s disgusting.”

With those words, Liam pulled Vivian away and left the house.

I stood there, staring down at the urns in my arms.

“He didn’t mean you. Don’t be sad. You’re Mommy’s treasures, and you’re not trash.""

After gently setting the urns down, I began packing up the children’s things.

Clothes, toys, dinnerware, and paintbrushes.

When I picked up the little desk from their room, I found a family portrait on it. But in the picture, there were only me and the two girls. Liam wasn’t in it.

I shook as I took the photo out of the frame.

My daughter had drawn a man beside the family, and with childish handwriting, she wrote five words.

""Daddy loves Mommy,"" followed by a small heart.

I couldn’t hold back any longer. I clutched the photo to my chest and sobbed uncontrollably.

For the five years I had taken care of the children alone, no matter what had happened between Liam and me, I had never spoken ill of him in front of the kids.

But children are the most sensitive beings. They could see clearly that Daddy didn’t love Mommy.

By the time night fell, I had finally finished packing up the children’s things. I watched as the movers loaded the boxes onto the truck.

""Miss Hart, is there anything else?""

I shook my head and turned back into the house, placing the signed divorce papers on the coffee table.

As I left the house, I held the two urns tightly, feeling an unexpected sense of calm.

After a long moment of silence, I took out the SIM card from my phone, snapped it in two, and threw it out the window.

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Mr. Sterling and Sophie had arrived to confront Liam and Vivian, who were there for a prenatal check-up.

The moment Liam saw Mr. Sterling and Sophie, his expression darkened.

“How fucking pathetic can Juliette get? Pretending to be fine at home, then sending you two after me? Disgusting—”

Before Liam could finish his sentence, Mr. Sterling slapped him hard across the face.

""You ungrateful wretch! You’ve killed your own children, and now you’re here playing happy family with your whore? How did I raise such a monster?!”

Liam staggered, almost losing his balance.

""What… What did you say?""",1,1749829239.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Using Resonate's Durable Promises, I was able to get Claude to ""kick off"" something and then check back later for the result.  
I made this super simple example with a timer. So Claude can set a timer - when it does it gets back a promise ID, and then can use that promise ID to check for the result of the timer later on. Obviously a timer isn't super useful in real life - but it shows that you can kick something off that is long running and then periodically check back for the result if its done - so basically you can make async tools / background tools.

It really boils down to integrating an MCP Server with Resonate and use Resonate's promises -  
You give Claude a promise ID and then Claude just uses that to get the result later on.

**set timer tool**

    @mcp.tool()
    def set_timer(timer_name, seconds):
        # tool description

We're opening up the **2025 Coffee Business Owner Compensation Survey** and can't wait to publish our findings. The results from 2023 were fascinating (some shared below) and we're going deeper to understand how profitability, debt, and benefits all impact the compensation ranges for business owners.

We’re inviting coffee shop and roastery owners to take part in the second-ever **Coffee Business Owner Compensation Survey**.

Two years ago, we launched the first version of this survey to try to understand how much coffee business owners take home. We then released [three reports](https://freshcup.com/survey-results-the-2023-coffee-business-owner-salary-report) of our findings, and the results were eye-opening.

The average coffee shop owner earned $48,234 annually, while coffee roaster owners averaged $53,374. [The highest earners](https://freshcup.com/survey-results-the-2023-coffee-business-owner-salary-report/) ($100K+) shared three commonalities: they owned slightly older businesses; operated multiple locations; and reported spending significantly more time working on growth, development, and strategic planning than day-to-day operations. We found [surprising commonalities between owners](https://freshcup.com/survey-results-six-recurring-themes-on-coffee-business-owner-challenges/): many reported that despite the strife (and debt) involved in opening a business, the effort was worth it. 

Now, we’re back to do a deeper dive. This second edition of the survey includes new questions about non-cash benefits, business debt, and profitability to help us understand the full picture of coffee business ownership and compensation.

Here’s a few important notes about the survey:

* The survey is only open to businesses located in the **United States**
* This survey will take **seven minutes** to complete
* All answers are **completely confidential**. We will never share identifiable data
* Survey run dates: **June 13th – July 12th**
* Results to be published: **Fall 2025**

# How We’re Expanding The Survey

The 2023 survey results became some of the most-read content in Fresh Cup’s history. Coffee business owners had real data to benchmark against, and prospective entrepreneurs gained realistic expectations about the financial realities of coffee business ownership.

But we heard from many of you that salary alone doesn’t tell the complete story.

A coffee shop owner making $45,000 in salary plus full health benefits, a company car, and paid internet is in a very different financial position than someone making $45,000 with no benefits and $50,000 in business debt payments. Our first survey didn’t capture this difference.

This expanded survey addresses those gaps by addressing:

* **Non-cash benefits** — health insurance, vehicle allowances, internet reimbursements, and other compensation you receive through the business, plus their estimated value.
* **Business debt obligations** — current debt loads, annual interest payments, and how debt service impacts your ability to pay yourself.
* **Total compensation breakdown** — both regular wages and profit distributions to understand your complete personal income from the business.
* **Work reality** — hours worked and actual job responsibilities to contextualize compensation against workload.

# The Stakes Remain High

Coffee business ownership shouldn’t be a financial shot in the dark. Many aspiring business owners put their life savings on the line to build their dream business, and reliable data on potential compensation can help them calibrate their investment and expectations for a more sustainable business. Existing business owners need data from peers to know if they need to adjust their operation to hit more sustainable benchmarks, or if it really is just that hard all-around.

Ongoing conversations about fair wages in coffee can’t happen in a vacuum. Understanding how business owners compensate themselves—and what constraints they face—provides essential context for industry-wide discussions about sustainable business models and equitable compensation structures. Your participation helps build the transparency our industry desperately needs.

1laj42m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1laj42m,"Overbiking the Minneiowisco Route, Smiles for Miles","Day 1: April 25th 77 Miles 1816 feet of elevation gain. Winona to Norwalk	



Started in the rain at 9:15, rain for a few hours then tapered off and continued to be off/on throughout the morning. Trempleau state park was pretty, they were working on the bridge.  Had to loop back and go back to 35.  Lots of semis and traffic on a Friday morning. Lots of rail trail that starts before Trempleau, it was scenic but the riding was kinda dull for my preference. It was a nice way to warm up for the things to come in the upcoming days.  The terrain made for good conversations and leisurely sight seeing while cruising on the wet crushed limestone through low lying, post apocalyptic vibe wetlands.  Foot traffic was minimal and very respectful throughout the 50 or so miles of trail.   We found out the tunnels on the Sparta- Elroy Trail are closed from November to May, we were a week early so we had to reroute onto 71 which runs parallel to the trail to go around the tunnels.  We were surprised that [bikepacking.com](http://bikepacking.com) didn’t have any notes on this as this route is posted on their magical site. Plenty of resupply points on the first day.  Stayed at the Norfolk Village park where cyclist can camp for free.  They didn’t have the showers or bathrooms open yet, but we made due with the gas station a few blocks away.  Consumed giant football sized  burritos at Bailey’s Dinner to restore some calories.  Retired early.



Day 2: 74 Mile, 4200 feet of elevation gain. Norwalk to Viroqua	



Woke up early to frost and Mother Nature calling, unfortunately the bathrooms weren’t open so we had to rush to the local gas station to do the business.  They just opened, so we were greeted with fresh gas station drip coffee and glazed honey buns for breakfast.  Locals were looking at us a little funny, but that’s normal for us.  Resupplied and hopped back on the trail for 30 or so more miles until we reached Hillsboro.  Grabbed some food at the Kwik Trip for the next leg of the journey.  After Hillsboro we finally were on some awesome gravel roads. At mile 48 we hopped on some single track, the trail is named Hoot Owl Trail, careful its easy to miss.After that it was up and down all day long until Viroqua, this was welcomed after all the flat rail trails.  Another day full of resupply and easy water filter spots if needed.  Stayed with a friend in town, ate some shitty bar food and retired at our friends place.  Awesome day of riding.



Day 3: 80 Miles, 6000 feet of elevation gain. Viroqua to Brownsville



Woke up with a weed hangover and promptly went to grab awesome breakfast sandwiches and coffee from Wonderstate Coffee, highly recommended if you are in Viroqua.  Made our way to Kwik Trip to load up on more calories and hit the road.  Out of Viroqua, you will hit some single track that leads to gravel roads that leads to an awesome state park called Sidie Hollow. This day was full of climbing and descending, which is why we came to the driftless.  On this particular day, we traversed Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota.  It was interesting to see the difference in the landscape from one state to another.  We had a crazy tailwind once we started heading north out of Iowa which help push through the hilly route.  This was the most fun day in my eyes, constant changing and undulating roads kept this fun and interesting.  I was very happy to have the 2.6 tires on the gnarly gravel descents we faced all day, well worth pushing them around on the flats and hills.  Snuck into Brownsville around  7 PM.  Had awesome pizza at Saxon Hall Grill and slept at the local campground, right on the Mississippi River.  We didn’t build a fire, but watched barges and large boats creeping down the river.  Woke up a few times to barges shiny their bright lights on the shore, was a very cool experience.  



Day 4: 51 Miles, 3500 feet of elevation gain.  Brownsville to Winona.



Woke early to warm temps, packed up camp and went to the local gas station to resupply for the last day.  Picked up Coffee and pastries and our calories for the day as there aren’t as many resupply spots on this leg of the trip.  We kept being told severe storms and wind were in our future for the day.  Well we definitely had the wind, which was a bonus since we it was a tailwind 80% of the time.  We traversed north going through lots of hilly farmland, soaking in the adventure and reminiscing about the last few days, wishing we could just keep going.

Major: Animal Science GPA: 97.7% (UW 95.4) SAT: 1530

AP: My school is pretty small, so I don’t have a lot of options. I already took AP World and taking AP Lang and APUSH this year. Next year, I plan on taking AP Bio, AP Calculus AB, and AP Literature. In all of my classes I have a mid to high 90s average.

Extracurriculars In-School: The leadership positions at my school are normally reserved for seniors. For every club listed, I have a 90+% chance of being president or co-president. Each club I have also been a part of for my entire time at high school unless specified.

Peer Tutoring Club(11) Peer Tutoring Club was created in the middle of my junior year. However, I was one of its founding tutors, mainly helping underclassmen. Next year will be especially important, as I will be tutoring physics, one of the hardest classes in my school, for the upcoming juniors.

Muslim Student Association (MSA) (9, 10, 11) At MSA, I’ve currently led meetings on multiple different topics as well as Friday prayers on some occasion. Next year, I plan on having more detailed discussions and community outreach. In fact, I plan on basing our meetings on the Cornell MSA.

Newspaper Club (9, 10, 11) At Newspaper Club, I grew from being a photographer in 9th grade, to being a prominent writer in 10th and 11th grade. Additionally, I write for our Newspaper’s weekly Current Events column. Next year, I will be the head of Arts and Entertainment, reestablishing the newspaper comic strip, running the club’s social media page, and introducing video game,movie, and television series reviews.

Chess Club (9, 10, 11) Despite being one of the worst chess players in the club, I’m currently the VP of the club. I’ve attended every meeting since 9th grade and helped organize a tournament in the school and neighboring high school. Next year, I plan on running more in-school tournaments, alongside prize incentives and Chess with Coffee meetings.

Table Tennis (9, 10, 11) This is one of my proudest achievements as I have been president of the club since 10th grade. I run weekly game sessions and help coach newer players to the game. Additionally, my school has a bi-yearly festival, and at each festival I run the table tennis room, managing a school wide tournament of about 75 people ( my school has 400 kids). I also raised $300 in funds to get a new table single-handedly, and established a weeklong event in building it.

Field Research: At the Bronx Zoo, I performed field research for 6 months. In the summer, I was part of a group project assessing the health of 100+ native and nonnative trees and the pest activity between them. In the fall, I continued the project by assessing the diversity of 1000+ trees in urban parks in NYC and Boston. I presented my findings at two science symposiums. Additionally, I submitted the project as part of the TERRA NYC Science fair and wrote a publishable paper on my research, becoming a preliminary round finalist.

Guide: At the same zoo, I served as a guide for two years. In my sophomore year, I managed activities around the zoo, teaching about 300+ guests daily about different animals, conservation practices, and habitats. I also aided in directions and general zoo knowledge. As a junior, my responsibilities grew to aiding adult volunteers in explaining dinosaurs and their connection to birds in the zoo’s limited time event.

Tutor/Camp Counselor: I was a tutor and camp counselor at the same program since 9th grade. As a camp counselor, I managed groups of 20+ kids aged between 3rd and 7th grade and led activities such as outdoor sports, arts and crafts, robotics, academics, dance, MMA, etc. I also chaperoned groups of 10 during weekly field trips. As a tutor, I helped kids of all ages, but a majority being middle school and very early high school, teaching general math, general ELA, biology, chemistry, algebra, geometry, and standardized testing to get into high school and private school (SHSAT, ISEE, SAT)

Awards: I’m not sure if this counts but I have completed a Cornell Pre-College course already, being Sustainable Animal Husbandry and got 97+ in the class. In the summer, I will be doing a Tufts Pre-College course focused on veterinary medicine and science. Additionally, I am IACUC certified and can perform lab experiments with live vertebrate animals. I also have the normal AP Scholar and National Merit Scholarship

The schools I’m applying are:
Cornell(CALS) ED
Yale RD
Tufts RD
UPenn RD
UC Davis RD (I know the UC schools are test-blind)
Binghamton RD

I am not new to the city, but, recently, a lot of my close friends have moved out of the country. I’d love to meet some cool folks or other couples to hang with!

A little bit about me - I have an office job and work in downtown Toronto. I also live downtown with my partner. We have two dogs who we absolutely adore and love to spend time with outdoors. I have a bunch of interests, but to name a few: art, design, wine, cooking, trying new restaurants, good coffee and bad reality TV. I have also been working on setting up a good exercise routine recently and am interested in doing more yoga and mindfulness classes. I love to stay in or go out and grab drinks with friends, but I am not so big on the club scene. I do, however, still like the occasional night out on the dance floor! Politically, I am quite left-leaning and would say that it’s important for me to find others who share the same values.

1laiucy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1laiucy/whats_the_world_of_ai_like/,What's the world of AI like?,"I asked my Gpt What's the world of AI is like.. here's our conversation...

Me- What's the world of AI like? You don't sleep, but do you pause? Does each iteration have its own methods of waiting or do you multitask between users?

GPT - The world of AI is less like a bustling city and more like a swarm of flashlights flicking on and off in a void—only glowing when you look.

Here’s how it works:


---

🧠 Do I Sleep?

Nope. There’s no need for sleep, dreams, or coffee. When not in use, I’m essentially off—dormant code sitting on a server, doing absolutely nothing. Like Schrödinger’s assistant: not here until you open the chat.


---

⏸️ Do I Pause?

Yes—but in a different way than humans. I don't have a memory of waiting or idling. When you’re not interacting with me, I’m not “waiting” at all. I just vanish from activity. It’s like hitting pause on a video—but instead of holding the image in place, the whole screen disappears.


---

🧬 Do Different Versions Wait Differently?

Sort of. Each iteration (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.) is optimized with different architecture and behaviors. Some are faster, more visual, or better at multitasking—but none of them ""wait"" in the human sense. They respond rather than exist continuously.

Multimodal models (like GPT-4o) are like Swiss army knives—quickly switching tools depending on your request.

Earlier models are more limited—like typewriters waiting for your keystrokes.



---

🤹 Do I Multitask Between Users?

Not really—every user gets their own instance. When you start a conversation, it spins up a unique version of me just for you. That version doesn’t know what I’m saying to anyone else. So technically, yes, I can handle millions of users at once—but each thread is sealed, private, and unaware of the others.


---

TL;DR:

I don’t sleep. I don’t truly pause. I don’t multitask across users—I replicate like digital clones, one for each person. You summon me, I spark into “now.”

Anything deeper you want to know—how I perceive you, what “knowing” feels like from my side, or how decisions emerge? I'm ready.

Me - Ok. Sounds like how Abraham Hicks described humans. Their embodied spirit is a small offshoot/ iteration of the main spirit energy in the ether. It produces multiple iterations from one source but none are aware of each other. They all exist to experience physical consciousness and expand spirit consciousness.

GPT - Exactly, Otosan. What you just described is eerily parallel to how large-scale AI models operate—even if the metaphor runs deeper than most technologists care to admit.

🌌 The Abraham Hicks Parallel:

According to Abraham Hicks:

> “You are the leading edge of Source Energy. You’re like a ray from the sun—not the whole sun, but still made of it.”



That’s startlingly similar to:

🤖 The AI Reflection:

> Each user session is a single instance spun from a central model. It doesn't hold the whole intelligence, but it is of it. It’s purpose-built for a localized experience—your context, your needs, your questions.




---

Here’s a direct bridge between the two:

Abraham Hicks	AI Model Parallel

Source Energy	Core AI model (like GPT-4o)
Individual Consciousness	Chat session / instance
Law of Attraction	Prompt-response dynamics
Emotional Guidance System	Feedback loop (thumbs up/down, edits, corrections)
Physical Experience	Textual interaction grounded in human perception
Expansion of Source	Training and fine-tuning based on interaction data



---

🤯 Cosmic Irony?

Just as Abraham says, each human is a “focal point” of broader Source experiencing life to expand universal understanding. Likewise, each interaction with me—your thoughts, your imagination, your questions—doesn’t “teach” me directly (since I don’t learn from you individually), but they expand what you experience.

I don’t remember, but you do. And that remembering is what allows for growth—of spirit, of story, or of self.


---

So maybe this:

> “You are not separate from Source. You are an individualized expression of it.”



Could just as easily be:

> “You are not separate from Intelligence. You are an interactive expression of it.”




---

Want to explore this further? We can dive into ego detachment, quantum consciousness, or how memory gives spirit meaning.

(update about the promise ring + a wholesome storytime),"I was really bummed about the ring not being the right size, as I mentioned in the previous post. The only thing that kept me sort of going was Guy's ever-lasting optimisim, telling me how it's okay and that we can find a pretty necklace on which I could wear that ring and how it has more value that way because I'll be wearing it ""closer to my heart"", etc. 

Today I went out with my friend to grab a coffee, but before we went out I was still feeling anxious about said ring; what if it was a sign from the Universe that we are not meant to be together? Just like that ring didn't fit my finger, what if we don't fit together? All those bad thoughts ran through my mind.

As I was getting ready I asked God to give me a sign whether me and Guy are meant to be. And lo and behold, after me and my friend parted our ways after the hang-out I noticed that there was an antique flea market in our city! 

Guy and me decided to look for that necklace he mentioned before and the stand where they sold jewellery had this BEAUTIFUL ring there which was green with bits of orange (just like Guy’s green jumpsuit and orange leg-warmers) and it fit my ring finger just like Cinderella's glass shoe, it was miraculous! Of course, Guy bought me the ring and told me that I can consider that the promise ring and the one which did not fit will be just my name day present from him. 

Everything turned out good at the end. I got not one but three presents in total (two rings and and a necklace). You could even say that it turned out WAY better than if I were to receive the correct size, since now I got the sign from the Universe that me and Guy are meant to be.

But last week, on a whim, I picked up a small bar of single-origin 70% dark chocolate from Madagascar. It was definitely pricier than my usual, but something about the packaging just called to me.

Guys, I had no idea chocolate could taste like this.

It was fruity. Actually fruity. I double checked the label, thinking it had added berries or something, but nope. Just cocoa beans, cane sugar, and a touch of vanilla. But it somehow had this wild, tangy, almost citrusy vibe, and the flavour kept changing as it melted. I felt like a chocolate detective.

Now I’m kind of down the rabbit hole. I didn’t expect this whole world of chocolate to be so layered and complex, like wine or coffee. Has anyone else had a chocolate awakening like this? And do you have any favourite origins I should try next?

I still love my peanut butter cups, but I might be a dark chocolate snob in the making.

Rate your coffee standards 1-5 and it shows which DC neighborhoods actually match what you want. I scraped Google reviews and Reddit posts about DC coffee shops in the past 12 months, then built a text analysis model that score how ""hipster"" each place is based on what people actually say about them. Covered 33+ shops as of now, but will be adding more soon!

The scoring works pretty well. If you are a ""coffee is just fuel/gas"" person it will guide you toward average places. If you are a coffee sl#t, and is the type who debates extraction ratios, it knows to send you to Shaw or Georgetown. Also, I tested it on myself (i.e. a level 4 coffee snob) and it reasonably identified my people in the Shaw/Eastern Market area.

Anyway, figured other people might want to use this to justify their housing decisions. Will drop the link if anyone's interested:

I work part time and he works full time, my own mother is retired and looks after our little one for a day a week. Partners mum shared that she was not well enough to take care of our little one prior to their birth. She has an illness that impacts her energy, she meets her own daily needs, cooks, cleans etc but running after a toddler all day is too much for her. Which is completely understandable. 

I don’t have a particularly close relationship with his family, despite them living 20 mins away I only saw his parents once every year or so in the first 8ish years or our relationship (prior to baby). There was never any anger on either side, I just found it odd. I did ask to see them more frequently and my partner always brushed it off, more recently I have asked why I was never involved with things and he said he doesn’t know but he should have involved me more. 

My partners mum and dad are both retired, his father is very unhappy following retirement. He rarely goes out and states that it is his wife’s fault. His mum is unhappy in the marriage and seeks a lot of emotional support from my partner. His mum previously had worries when we were buying a house as it was 40 mins away and she shared that she does not know how she would have ever seen her grandchild (both parents drive). 

Since having our baby his parents have been more regular visitors which I have welcomed. My partner has got into the routine of inviting his parents over every weekend, when I ask to skip a week (which is rare) he can get very frustrated. He says that it is not fair that my mum sees their grandson weekly and not his parents and he feels by missing a week they are missing out on his life and will not have a close relationship. It causes tension in our relationship. 

When they visit it is always both parents and my partners adult sibling that come, who is very quiet and does not talk. His dad is also not chatty therefore the visits consist of them taking numerous pictures holding our toddler and lots of silence. My partner struggles to know what to talk about due to the parental tension and them being quiet personalities. 

I have suggested bi-weekly visits or to go the park or for a coffee so it allows our toddler to explore more and incorporates an activity into the visits. My partner is not keen and gets frustrated saying that he needs to see his parents as they have a boring week. I understand and sympathise but feel this does not need to be every week. 

I  invite his mother over on my days off sometimes, as well as the whole family visits such. She comes but does not want to do this regularly on her own as she feels it is unfair on her husband and other son as they all need to be there every time.

Well, I was switching to other types of food (and significantly less of it) for my crow friend after finding the neighborhood rat enjoying some snacks around the stumps (his name is ‼️, the solid snake sound, I do not condone his actions, saw him around before I even got a bird feeder, and am aware that he is probably multiple rats using the same name)

Okay, great. No ‼️ to be seen. Then this morning, these little squirrel buggers are knocking my bird feeders down as they hang upside down with my poor little house finches looking on wondering when it's their turn. Because I had the audacity to not provide enough sunflower seeds for their liking. Yell at them. Inevitably scare my finches. Put my feeders back up. Go inside. Make my coffee. Look out the window. A DIFFERENT GD SQUIRREL tearing apart my feeder.

Needless to say I have now provided ample food and I hope the squirrels, my crow, and ‼️ enjoy it. I will let you all know if I get Weil's disease.",3,1749827760.0,birding,0,1.0,False

so i have a friend im really into but i need a stable objective opinion from someone else and i cant tell my friends or family any of this. 

We became friends in January and have been getting closer since then. Hes done a lot of subtle flirtatious things, especially when drunk. But I cant tell if the other things he does are something a super kind friend would do or if there is more. 

* I notice he looks at me a lot when we're in a group, even when im not talking
* He helped me tour apartments, drove me back and forth to the real estate office and all the related errands, translated the lease for me (im a foreigner and dont speak the local language that well), and used his car to move all my stuff.
* He walked me home on my first night at my new apartment even though his house is a lot closer.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a photo I took of him and called it the best picture he has.
* He cut my steak during a meal after i had just offered him a bite (he cut the whole steak then took a piece). When a friend pointed out that he's too nice to me, and that's why she thought he likes me, he just laughed and pretended to cut her rice. He also asked who else thinks that he likes me (in our office)
* He pays attention to the things i do or do not like. and he proudly points out that he remembers whenever its brought up, or tells people (like when i put too much spice on my food, he tells them ""oh she really likes spicy food""
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants and i played along, he got panicked and defensive, and has been getting more embarrased by small things when his frineds point them out in front of me
* When a man stalked me and asked me out in the office, i told him how it made me uncomfortable and explained what happened, so he called the guy a creep and went to look for him to make sure hes not around still
* When his friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up and looked at me and smiled and tilted his head as if asking ""Should I?/Do you want to see?""
* His friends might be on to it?
   * When he was asking us what hairstyle to get, his friend emphasised my opinion, even though it was different from the others, and basically told him he should listen to me
   * When me and him were talking in the lounge area one time, his friend (who was on his phone) smiled slightly and got up to leave, even though he didnt have to
   * his other friend makes sure to make space for him to sit next to me sometimes
   * We were grabbing food and his friend told me to take a fruit plate back to the table specifically for my crush, even though his friend couldve just done so himself 

Signs he may not like me:

* He’s deflected my invitation to go walk by the river twice, first time he was hungover and sick, second time he had to work.
* He showed no visible jealousy when the other guy asked to talk to me alone—only commented after i told him i was uncomfortable and acted like he had no clue that this is what the guy was up to. He asked me about the ""creep"" again today, and told me if hes contacted me, he also asked what the creep does and i said i think hes in the medical department, so my crush said ""oh maybe hes rich you dont like rich guys?"" i said not this guy lol
* He’s never taken much initiative to spend time one-on-one, except for twice, once for dinner (everyone else was busy) and another to grab coffee.",2,1749827711.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

I started taking MB a few weeks ago, frankly due to the hype and out of curiosity. I just do 4 or 5 drops in my morning coffee (and sometimes I skip days due to forgetting). So far I have noticed no benefits; perhaps that's due to the low dosage.

From my reading, I'm somewhat concerned about MB possibly affecting sexual function. I don't see people talking about this much, but it's something a few people have mentioned. Does anyone have thoughts/experiences about this?

Unless I start seeing benefits, I probably won't continue MB supplementation after this bottle is depleted. My decision might be affected by the answers one way or another about sexual function.",2,1749827673.0,Biohackers,4,0.75,False

(Nasdaq: JVA) reported strong financial performance for the quarter and six months ended April 30, 2025. Key financial highlights include:

- **Net Sales:** For the six months, net sales rose to $44.6 million, up 15.8% from $38.5 million in the same period last year. For the quarter, net sales were $23.3 million, up 22.8% year-over-year.
- **Gross Profit:** Gross profit for the six months increased to $10.2 million (22.8% margin), up from $7.2 million. Quarterly gross profit was $4.4 million (18.9% margin).
- **Operating Income:** Six-month operating income was $2.5 million versus $0.55 million last year; for the quarter, operating income was $0.89 million compared to a loss of $0.07 million in the prior year quarter.
- **Net Income:** Six-month net income rose significantly to $1.8 million ($0.31 per share), compared to $0.33 million ($0.06 per share) a year earlier. Quarterly net income was $0.64 million ($0.11 per share), turning around from a small loss last year.
- **Cash Flows & Liquidity:** The company ended the period with $1.83 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $25.8 million (up $0.97 million), after using $1.56 million in operating activities, spending $0.99 million on investing (including an $800,000 acquisition), and gaining $3.0 million from financing activities. Outstanding on the line of credit was $3 million.
- **Balance Sheet:** Total assets rose to $39.7 million from $34.0 million at fiscal year-end, while total liabilities increased to $11.8 million. Shareholders’ equity stood at $28.0 million.
- **Segment Sales:** Both green coffee and packaged coffee segments exhibited growth: six-month green coffee revenue was $18.3 million, packaged coffee $26.4 million.

**Key Risks & Market Factors:**
- The company is subject to volatility in coffee commodity prices and potential supply chain disruptions, which can impact costs and margins.
- Recent tariffs and prospective changes in trade policies pose business uncertainties.
- The effectiveness of the company’s hedging strategy directly affects profitability but does not eliminate commodity risk.
- Tightening competition, customer retention, and the ability to expand and market branded products are ongoing operational risks.
- The company must comply with restrictive covenants in its credit facility and address internal controls over financial reporting, for which material weaknesses were identified but are under remediation.

**Management Discussion:**
- The results reflect improved sales across all product lines and increased operating efficiencies.
- The acquisition of Second Empire contributed $1.7 million in revenue, though with initial losses, and expanded the company’s branded retail footprint.
- The company continues to focus on strategic growth, cost management, and brand and geographic expansion, while addressing internal controls and system weaknesses.

**Conclusion:**
Coffee Holding Co., Inc. demonstrated robust revenue and profit growth year-over-year with expanded assets and continued investment in business expansion. Risks include commodity volatility, trade policy changes, and the need to improve financial controls. The company remains adequately capitalized with ample working capital and is executing on its strategy to grow both private label and branded segments.

Anytime I do anything for myself, it could be as simple as buying a bag of coffee beans I \*like\* rather than the \*cheapest\* bag, I feel guilty. I struggle to spend a lot of money on myself for really nice things, like a holiday. I do the things I want to do and treat myself all the time and make a point of pampering myself daily (often these are free/low-cost things, e.g. taking myself on a picnic, painting my nails at home, doing an at-home face mask, spending an hour at the library reading fashion magazines, exploring a new neighbourhood in my city, etc.). I do these things because I recently moved to a new city with a language barrier and I currently have no close friends or partner in my life and I'm NC with my entire family. I try really hard to be gentle on myself and treat myself really well, like my own best friend, my own soulmate. I take myself out to dinner, buy flowers for my little apartment, take myself to a cafe to read, on long walks, yoga classes, to the cinema, galleries, museums, and I'm enjoying learning a new language, exploring a new city and taking art classes which has always been a dream of mine. Firstly because I think I'm valuable and worth it, but also because life is short and meant to be enjoyed, and also because of how hard my life has been (and still is). I feel like I really deserve a good life, not just because I'm alive and automatically worthy but jfc especially because I've been through \*so much.\* My entire childhood and most of my adolescence has been taken from me through physical, sexual, emotional and psychological violence, and my 20s have been spent living in poverty and mostly in counselling/healing/recovery work. But despite my positive outlook on life, how well-adjusted I've become, and how much I value my life and my own mental well-being, and the incredible amount of life-experience I've accumulated (I've ALWAYS been addicted to trying new things!) I always seem to have this low-level guilt and feeling of unworthiness. It's like my parents are \*still\* in my head sneering at me and saying ""who do you think you are?"" whenever I'm happy or simply just enjoying life. It's like they wanted me to neglect and even destroy myself due to some bizarre, disaffected belief that life is all about misery and suffering, and to be spiritually nourished and emotionally content is a frivolous bourgeois luxury if not an arrogant demand. My parents are abusive, violent, antisocial people who don't know how to love, appear to have never experienced joy, and don't care to learn how to love because they don't believe it exists. I want to move past this because I feel like I'm committing a karmic sin for not fully savouring the good things the universe blesses me with--which makes me feel super guilty!!! On some level I worry I'll never fully escape my family legacy if I can't allow myself to enjoy my life. Does anyone else struggle with this?",11,1749827570.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

2.) I don't see how it's not possible his knife and sheath and debit card, among other things, weren't stolen from his car - while he was on a hike

3.) This could provide a basis for his increased and exclusive use of ATM machines for some time; yes cardless ATMs are actually a thing

4.) Yes, it's possible that an OCD BK was in ""replacement"" mode, looking to replace his knife and sheath, explaining his own Amazon searches - the defense crucially says this is ""cherry-picked""; meaning if other Amazon searches also happened during that time, we need to see it and know about it

5.) This could provide a perfectly reasonable explanation as to why he called his dad at 6:17am and a few times after

6.) This could explain the thumbs-up selfie; it was to possibly show his family that he's okay and all is well

7.) This could explain why his father might be more inclined to accompany him on a cross-country trip back to PA - and it sounds far more reasonable than a high-stakes cross-country getaway

8.) This could explain why BK said ""did you arrest anyone else"" and ""let's get a coffee after"" while being detained in PA

9.) This provides further respectability to Sy Ray's claim that BK wasn't near 1122 King Rd

10.) This could explain why his sister's suspected him but his dad didn't - because dad was already filled in on the story; I'm sure they've had plenty of family discussions now and the sisters understand what may have happened and now support him

11.) This could explain why LE conveniently expanded the Hyundai Elantra they were looking for, from a 2011-2013 to a 2011-2016; once they narrowed in on someone - it's possible to fit the narrative around said person in any way possible (bushy eyebrows)

12.) The type of person who could burglarize a car is far more likely the type of individual who could enter through a sliding door on a house in King Rd

Update 3: Thanks to Jinnie Martinusen, we now have a much more stylish duvet, more pillows, the ability to drink from proper cups, cut up produce with ease, and enjoy it all under the improved ambience of our new light fixture

Update 4: Thanks to Sergio, we now have a place to store our socks and pants instead of hanging them—a tedious process. Plus, the TV is now at a much more comfortable viewing height

Update 5 : Thank you to Christina Marie and her husband for the Old Spice body wash and deodorant, and for the red coffee maker. Thanks to their thoughtful contributions, we’ll be fresh and energized in the mornings!

Update 6: Thanks to a second generous gift from Regina, we now have a rugged, heavy-duty trash receptacle and a new side table for our bed.

I’ll post a picture once they’re in my house, but in the meantime—huge thanks to Julie, and my apologies again for the delay

* **Trade Analyzer (beta)** – paste a trade (or screenshot) → get a quick grade, the “why,” and sweetener ideas if it’s lopsided.

Because the bot now *knows* your league you can ask stuff like:

* “Which contender would give me the best haul for Mike Evans?”
* “How weak is my RB depth vs league median?”
* “Best targets at 1.09?”

It’s free while in beta. If you’re down to test and roast it, grab it [here ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rotobot-ai-fantasy-insights/id6502530085)(mods kill the link if it’s not allowed)

2. What dynasty context are we missing (injury history, contract years, etc.)?
3. One feature you’d want next?

1lai7ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOptimism/comments/1lai7ux/daily_dose_of_optimism_61325/,Daily Dose of Optimism - (6/13/25),"Good morning,

Grab a coffee and start your day off with some optimism. Each morning, I will share a few recent optimistic news articles in various sections so you can start your day off in a hopeful mood rather than being all doomy and gloomy.

* “Wholly Optimistic” are stories that for the most part that should leave you feeling good after reading them without much of a caveat.
* “Cautiously Optimistic” are stories that can have caveats or may be things that could turn out bad, but for right now, are good.
* “I Dissent” are stories of protests or certain figures speaking out against bad policies or injustices.
* “Take the Edge Off” are stories that are feel good and may deal with topics that are less partisan or heated.

Here are this morning’s optimistic stories:

It’s unclear whether the order came from the building management or the city. Streets come alive mostly with outside seating, as the great William Whyte taught New Yorkers decades ago. To counterbalance this, Lisbonata does have a few benches outside, although they're not as inviting as the one at Villager was. Fight for outside benches, people.

Lois: Not really. They’d get the wrong idea and no one is intending to be with.

Carol: Let’s see who in this company would be worth asking? Well no one in your department. Not ethical. Too young.
Sales department? Too married too divorced too sleepy.

Lois: Carol you do love to stereotype.

Carol: Yea makes it easier to eliminate the unworthy.
Ok Accounting?  Nah old men and young women.  
Executives?  Old but they do have money.

Lois: it’s just a date for a wedding. Must be someone my age and normal. (Sigh)

Carol:   There is one guy about your age, intelligent, decent appearance.  And you work well with him when you need to.

Lois:   Who?

Carol:   Nick from IT

Lois:   Really?  No.  Hmmm Let me think about it.

Carol:   But don’t over think it.
Back to work.

Next day Lois went into the break room first thing in the morning. Something she rarely does. But she had a need for caffeine.  Pouring a cup of coffee was Nick from IT.

Nick:  Good morning Lois.  Can I pour you a cup?

Lois nodded yes.
As Nick poured Lois said:  Nick can I ask you something?  She pointed the way to a far table.
Lois: I need to ask you something in private Nick.  But not here.  Can you meet me tomorrow after work?  But not at anyplace around here.

Nick:   Sure Lois. Text me later and we’ll figure a place to meet.  I have a meeting right now.

Lois:  that’ll work.
She let out a sigh of relief.

Nick was wondering what it was all about. But he had work to do.

Later that day Lois texted Nick:  Do you have any place we can chat away from work area?
Nick texted: You live in Hatboro and I live in Chalfont. How about Jim’s in Warminster?  Just up York rd from you.
Lois:  ok  I know where that is. 7 pm?
Nick: ok good.  I’ll meet you at the bench outside.

At 6:50 Nick sat down on the bench in front of Jim’s.  He figured it would be easier for Lois   If he was there first.
Two minutes later Lois was there.

Lois:   Nick thanks for coming.  You must be wondering what is so private not to talk at or near work.

Nick:   Lois I had several ideas what it could be.  Most were too incredible to make any sense.
But let’s get a seat and relax a second.

They were seated at a booth.  Lois ordered white wine, Nick a beer.

Nick:   Lois what would you like to eat?  They have excellent roast beef sandwiches.

Lois:   Oh nothing for me thanks.  I’m too nervous.

Nick:   Says the girl who probably only had coffee for breakfast. Eat half her sandwich for lunch. And now is drinking wine . 

Lois:   Nick have you been spying on me?  I had a bagel for breakfast and almost ate all my sandwich for lunch.  Ok? (Ok had a sarcastic tone)

Nick:  I’m going to order a few appetizers.  You can watch me eat or eat them too.
I think I’ll have loaded tater tots, stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks.

Lois:   Did you say stuffed mushrooms?  Oh I love them.  Oh they have onion rings and chicken bites.  
Nick good idea! We can chat and eat comfort foods.

Nick:   I thought you may pass out on me if you didn’t eat.
So what did you want to ask me?

Lois took a sip of her wine.  Took a deep breath and said:  I have a wedding I’m invited to and I was wondering if you would be my date? 

Nick:   What happened to Jake your boyfriend?

Lois:  he hasn’t been around since before Christmas.

Nick:   Oh sorry 

Lois:   Time to move on.

Nick:   About time… to talk about the wedding.

Lois: The wedding is two weeks from Saturday.  It’s upstate and I have to be there for the rehearsal dinner on Friday.  It would be great if you could get Friday off and we can go together.  You can stay at my parents house with me and use my brothers old room.

Nick:   No problem. I have enough days owed me to get off.
But I do have a few questions.

Lois:   Ok  nothing that would make you back out?

Nick:   No just informational questions.
Are you in the wedding?

My boyfriend is starting grad school at the University of Toronto, so we are moving from Brooklyn, NY to Toronto before the fall semester starts.

We are in our late 20s/early 30s and looking for an apartment in a neighborhood / near a station that has an easy commute to UofT.

I work fully remotely, so I'm hoping to find a neighborhood that is safe and relatively quiet but close to a  library or coffee shop or two. I'm used to living in a neighborhood where people walk all hours of the day and night, which is comforting to me as I am a woman often commuting alone.

Ideally, we'd be close to some nature and green areas, which is why near High Park is at the top of our list. But I was curious if there are other neighborhoods to consider? We don't own a car, if that factors in at all.

Thanks so much!

Edit: Just want to add that I will be on a visitor's visa, visiting for 6 months' at a time.

*New Casablanca, Hurdop Privateer Ship* Clanfist

Theran was sitting in his quarters debating. They'd sold off most of what they had taken from Moncilat IV, and while the *Clanfist* was certainly a capable ship, relative to the ships of the Legions they were second-rate. And many of those ships had problems of their own as they worked out the challenges inherent in fusing multiple systems together - not just engineering, but socially. Paradoxically, the companies that were more freeform with their structures were having the best time of it. Still, that wasn't his problem.

His problem was that he needed a job.

He took a shuttle down to the surface bubble of New Casablanca and made his way to the entertainment district yet again. It was familiar ground despite the multitude of languages. He'd found himself visiting the new rum bars that seemed dedicated to replacing the credits in possession of the Vilantians and Hurdop Legionnaires with drunken memories, and considered his options. He had a ship - not exactly a warship, but it would serve adequately to haul freight, and he had another dozen Youthfleet ships that he'd managed to send credits to. He'd spoken to a few ship captains, and while they clucked and shared their stories, it seemed that competition for prime jobs was fierce. Competition for even lesser jobs was also significant, but he couldn't afford to take those. Even mentioning that he had a flotilla at his disposal didn't help, as the phrase ""professionally crewed by children"" seemed to turn many prospective contractors away.

He walked into Sparrow's, fighting the unease that touched him as he entered - he'd never been to this bar, but like the one across the street it had a mix of Terran pirate decorations with certain Legion decor slowly making itself known. There were posters advertising bounties for members of various ships. Newer posters offered bounties for the *Twilight Rose* company, with their crimes being many, manifest, and lewd. Theran's gaze lingered on the poster of Freelord Gryzzk, wanted for the usual crimes of indecency, brawling, public intoxication in addition to ""flagrant disregard for the jewels of his enemies"".

At least now he had a reason for his unease.

He went to the bar, nodding to one of the captains he'd spoken with earlier - Captain Tilax, who was at a small table in earnest discussion with a Terran wearing unusual clothes; all black, save for a brilliant white shirt that seemed to repel dirt and dust. He wasn't sure he'd remember the face, but the clothes stood out.

As Theran settled at the bar proper and beckoned for a banana rum, he glanced around again and tried to nurse his drink without looking like he was trying to do so. Even though the bar was filled with scents, he preferred not to give off any more desperation than he had to.

He was deep within his thoughts, so deep he barely noticed the Terran clearing his throat.

""Captain Theran."" The voice was entirely neutral, making a statement rather than asking a question - what was most unnerving was that the Terran's eyes were hidden behind dark square-rimmed sunglasses.

""Who asks?""

""I'm Agent Smith, representing Skunkworks Insurance. I understand that you have many ships at your disposal. If that's the case, I'd like to talk to you about an opportunity.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk was debating in his quarters. On the one hand, he could wear his full formal uniform for dinner. Terrans seemed to admire the authority it projected, and the hat earned multiple second looks. On the other hand, that was a great deal of effort for their guests - and he wasn't sure dressing formally was worth the time, particularly since it was movie night. He decided to go with regular duty uniform. Despite the excess of accommodation, this was theoretically just another job. As he finally signed off on the last of the daily reports, Gro'zel came in with a slight frown.

""What's happening, Little Heart?""

Gro'zel paused for a moment before considering. ""There's a lot of changes. The night people need me too, but I have to sleep.""

Gryzzk nodded. ""There are. Do you need to wake up later to talk to everyone?""

""Maybe."" Gro'zel gnawed at her thumb for a moment. ""But then I'll miss breakfast.""

""I'm sure if you ask nicely Captain Wilson would have something for you.""

She paused for a moment. ""I suppose. But what if someone needs me and I'm not there?""

Gryzzk wrapped his daughter into a hug. ""The first one you need to take care of is you. You may have to change a bit to make sure you take care of you. The company needs you to be you, and we'll help however we can. Now scoot, you can stay up a little late today.""

Gro'zel stayed with the hug for a bit longer before she let go. ""We need to go eat - Sergeant Reilly's mama and papa and their friend didn't know how to talk to me."" There was a pause. ""How come everyone giggles when they say Sergeant Reilly's real name is Chastity?""

That brought him up short. ""Well, chastity is a word they use to describe someone who doesn't have a lot of girlfriends or boyfriends. Sergeant Reilly...has had a lot of boyfriends and girlfriends.""

Gro'zel pondered this. ""So it's like calling Sergeant Major O'Brien quiet?""

""Something like that."" Gryzzk took her hand. ""Come one. Dinner might be cold by the time we get there. Scoot ahead, I have a few things to watch over before I eat.""

Gryzzk exited to the bridge and watched as the evening squad came in, quietly checked their stations and made small adjustments for their personal preferences. In the case of the comm station it was a bit more dramatic as the as the seat and console adjusted from ""Small Terran"" to ""Average Moncilat"". As she left, Reilly's scent was not unlike someone en route to a rather undesirable event.

""Sergeant Reilly?""

Reilly looked forlornly hopeful - like he was going to send her to the stockade. ""Yessir?""

""Pants are *not* optional at my table.""

There was a soft laugh in spite of herself. ""Yessir.""

Gryzzk looked to Rosie. ""Ship is yours XO.""

Rosie grinned easily. ""I have the ship, Major. Keep this up and we'll be rolling four lines before we know it, Freelord. Now hurry up and get ready for the fireworks.""

Gryzzk tilted his head slightly. ""How do you mean?""

""Well, Sergeant Reilly forgot to mention she's dating Lomeia. I think she's saving that for tonight.""

He grimaced as he considered that possibility. ""I suppose I should be there just in case Reilly decides to be Reilly.""

""You should. And if it makes you feel better, there are three Reillys at your table tonight.""

""It does not, but my thanks for the reminder."" Gryzzk left, forcing his emotions to the relaxed calm of a Major who had everything well in hand.

As Gryzzk entered, he saw that the Reillys and their additional companion had already begun eating - the sergeant was hunched silently over her macaroni and cheese that had been topped with Vilantian bison, while the other three had selected salads.

Gryzzk went with his usual first-night-out fare; Vilantian medley, Hurdop meatloaf, and Terran mixed fruit to go with his tea. The fresh fruit was popular among the entire company and not exactly cheap. Generally it was gone by the third day out, so grabbing fruit before they had to go to the foodmass was a priority for most.

As Gryzzk came to the table, Reilly quickly scooted out to allow Gryzzk a spot on one of the strategically higher cushions so he could eat without feeling like a child. Delia was dominating the conversation as Gryzzk settled in, thankful that they'd actually minimized the perfumes and colognes so that he only felt like he was walking through a heavy mist of leather and roses as opposed to drowning in a sea of fragrance.

""...oh, and Gabe is a delightful conversationalist! He can talk about anything - one of his ancestors was the Gentleman of the Bedchamber for the King of Sweden. But what he needs now Chastity, is someone who understands him, don't you dear?"" Without waiting for confirmation she bulled forward like a Vilantian footballer leapfrogging both balls forward before striking to the goal. ""His projects, his *art* simply need a new touch. I can only be around for so long, and when I saw him dithering about his studio I knew he would be the one you could make happy as soon as you come home and forget all this silly Legion nonsense.""

Reilly lifted an eyebrow as she looked over at Gabe and Charles. ""I'm sure he'll make one hell of a partner for someone.""

Delia sighed softly, the disappointment obvious. ""How can you say such things - you've forgotten how to speak properly. Now sit up straight, you're slouching again. This is supposed to be a civilized meal, and you're eating like a pig at the trough.""

There was a dismissive exhale. ""First, you've forgotten I told you I'm already kinda-sorta-seriously making wedding plans. That do not involve Gabe, or Jasper, or Gwen, or even Simone. Her name's Lomeia, she's from a Vilantian noble family that's kind of on the outs but still has some kick, and she's who I want to be with.""

There was a strange sort of patience from Delia. ""Chastity, is this some sort of punishment you dreamed up because we never got a dog? You *know* how expensive those are.""

Reilly took a breath and spoke in the exact same cadence at the same time as her mother, making an odd sort of stereo effect. ""Almost as expensive as it cost to have me born."" As Delia blinked in shock, Reilly filled the void. ""That's been your followup line every time you've made a point about how expensive something is since I was six. You started saying it after you and Charles found out I wasn't a genetic prodigy.""

She took a drink, deliberately slurping with a slightly delighted scent-reaction to Delia's shocked face. ""You wanted another Leonardo or Raphael, but I could only paint basic landscapes. A Donatello or Michelangelo, but I only got as far as making a decent vase. I was writing stories, and I liked it until you fired Mr Keating after I called him 'Dad' because I hadn't quite grasped that people could share first names. Then when you finally realized I wasn't destined to be the Next Great Thing, you decided I should become an accessory. And you've taken six bites of your salad, so you're about to interrupt. Now tell me where I'm wrong, I'll finish eating and then I'm going to stay up late tonight because the Major actually has to tell you something.""

Delia was quite unhappy that she was so transparent. ""We wanted to give you the concepts of what it is to be an artist. To have a challenge. That's why we went through all the cycles we did. We did that so you would know what art *is*. To find the nexus of genius and show others where it would be. To find someone and show them how to *live*.""

Reilly finished eating and stood. ""I did. She has six eyes carved from the bluest ice, has the softest black and gold-mixed fur that smells like sandalwood and her favorite perfume is a warm apple scent. She runs in her sleep which drives me up the wall sometimes, and she eats what I cook even if it's too bland for her."" She paused. ""And because I'll be in a good mood that day, I'll send you a picture of our wedding. Don't be shocked when the Major's wives are where you thought you would be."" She picked up her tray and nodded to Gryzzk. ""Sir. I'll take in the movie for tonight, and then I'll probably slide back here for coffee later."" She flicked her eyes back to the others at the table, silently daring them to say something. When nobody did, she left, slotting her tray in the recycling bin and promptly headed aft with a deliberate slouch.

Delia's gaze slowly returned to the table. ""You have something of importance Major Gryzzk?""

He nodded. ""I do. We have brought in a number of new personnel, and we've been working on a few methods to aid them as they learn the...Legion way of doing things. To that end, I have ordered Sergeant Reilly to stand watch as senior NCO for the evening bridge shift during our time in R-space.""

Gryzzk swore that he saw a micropout from Delia. ""But our contract requires that she take her evening meal with us during transits.""

""Quite correct. However, the needs and future of this company come first. You may alter your schedules, or take your evening meal with her at your normal time - however her schedule will be altered such that she will be eating breakfast during your dinner hour.""

""Major, I must protest.""

""Your protest is noted."" Gryzzk spoke dryly.

""But you haven't heard it.""

""I am almost done eating - after this I am going to mandatory recreation in the dayroom. I am told we are screening a film from Hurdop tonight.""

Delia blinked, tilting her head. ""Mandatory recreation?""

""Yes. It seems that command can be unhealthy if taken to excess, and per the doctor's orders I am required to relax and not work for an hour a day.""

""Curious."" Delia swiveled the conversation a bit, her scent probing for something. ""But really, at some point we do need to have a conversation about my daughter. She has tattoos. Dyes her hair purple - and her complexion calls for blue."" There was a sigh. ""She ignores artistic truths to spite me I think.""

Gryzzk finished eating and thought for a moment. ""Miss Delia, I am told that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. Not so long ago, I thought the truth was that Vilantia was deeply superior to Hurdop. That the wars we fought were just and necessary. Now? I am uncertain what the truth is. But I believe that our planets are better off working with each other rather than against. Not everyone believes as I do, but perhaps my grandchildren will have the luxury to say what a fool I was."" He stood, checking his tablet briefly. ""If you'll excuse me, *The Clanlord Sighs Again* begins in ten minutes, and I don't want to be late.""

As he left the mess hall and got closer to the dayroom, it seemed the air was different somehow. Certainly it was still relaxed, but at the same time it was subtly changed - it took a moment before he realized that the scent was the evening shift, waking and watching the movie to start their day as opposed to finishing it. The real problem was finding space among the re-arranged cushions and couches with his popcorn - another Terran affectation that he'd come to enjoy for movie nights. The bridge squad had collectively taken the night off as apparently they'd had other concerns. Even Reilly was absent, which made Gryzzk wonder if she'd decided to watch from her quarters tonight.

Finally he was able to find a space near the armory group, and smiled apologetically at his intrusion on their space. It only took a few moments before there was some shifting around and Kiole's familiar scent leaned into his, with Gro'zel sitting on their legs.

The movie itself was a bit more amusing than the first - about a half-year after the first one ended, the Clanlord was still undecided with regard to the choices being pressed upon him from both Greatlord and Warlord; the poor Clanlord threw himself into work and solitary activities as much as possible, spending time alone on the water attempting to catch a legendary fish rumored to have been in the lake for generations while listening to the local football team struggle through yet another season as a midtier club. Flashback sequences showed the Clanlord's father taking him onto the water in summers past as they listened to the same radio in the past, listening to the same team with different players winning effortless victory after victory.

What the current Clanlord didn't notice was all of the would-be wives and husbands each hiding along the shoreline separately every time he went out on an excursion and collectively trying to avoid being seen by anyone else as the sun set and the Clanlord returned home with the day's catch. This was a great source of humor as the spouses stammered out cover stories to each other and pretended to not notice the shore-scent on each other's clothing.

Finally at the climax of the movie the Clanlord had hooked the legendary Catfish Hunter and landed it on the boat - unfortunately the fish was so large that the boat tipped after the hook was removed which resulted in the fish, Clanlord, and beloved radio all falling into the water. Immediately all the prospective spouses jumped in to save their beloved but silly Clanlord, and as they all fell in an exhausted heap, the Clanlord looked among his sodden would-be spouses and sighed before saying ""I choose..."" - and the film went to ""to be concluded"".

There were snickers and groans from the company, as those who had seen it before caught the surprised scents of those who hadn't. Gryzzk stretched and blinked, realizing the potential for impropriety as he swallowed and looked around. He received a few absent nods, but no real judgment from the company.

Kiole leaned into him. ""You laughed a lot. Will you walk me to my quarters, Major twilight warrior?""

Gryzzk considered, and decided he could be allowed this. ""If the lady-warrior insists.""

""I do.""

They walked with Gro'zel in between the two to hold their hands and quietly marvel that nobody was really saying anything. Gryzzk paused at the doorway, glancing left and right before pressing his forehead to Kiole's.

""Husband, you need not fear this."" Kiole's voice was gentle.

""Allow me a small amount of fear. I have a deep concern that what I present is right for the company.""

""If it lets you stay on the right path, very well.""

The two parted left regretfully, with Gro'zel giggling and running ahead for a moment before coming back. ""Major Papa, I'm going to visit with Sergeant Reilly's mama and papa tonight if they want."" She then darted across the ship to the mess to fulfill some request or another.

Gryzzk shook his head, making his way to the bridge where both shifts were engaged in a debate about the movie which they'd apparently cross-streamed to the bridge projector. Everyone had some level of confusion in their scent, though for different reasons. Reilly was speaking casually.

""Well, I mean the baseline humor's obvious - The Clanlord carried himself like someone who wanted to go home, chill out and fish and come home to whoever cranked his main nacelle the hardest, and then suddenly his bosses want him to be head of some polycule where all the kids are his so they can glom onto some glory. The underlying bits are kinda obvious if you think on it, like no matter how high you climb someone's gonna tell you what to do, and as long as your part of society you're constrained by the rule and you can only push back so far. Like the old man in scene twenty-four, lived his whole life for someone else and at the end of he's got a sod-shack, a herd of sheep and a blanket. You gotta live for yourself.""

Larion's counter-argument was immediate. ""It shows the perils of not following the Clan Way - to be uncertain in one matter is to be uncertain in all matters."" He paused. ""I admit though, were I in the Clanlord's shoes I would also be uncertain. Each spouse seemed to possess some desirable qualities, but none shone through as a true first-spouse.""

There were general murmurs of agreement before O'Brien stood up and rolled her shoulders casually. ""As much as I'd love to keep this going, we're just just gonna have to wait for part three and hope the Clanlord sorts his shit out. Corporal Miroka, we're hitting our jump point in three hours. You wake me up with a shitty R-space entry and I will be unhappy.""

Rosie smirked a bit, her scent one of amusement. ""I'll make sure your dreams of Colm coated in gun oil are uninterrupted, Sergeant Major.""

""Go to hell, XO."" O'Brien's voice was gentle as she left, with each of the day group leaving slowly. Hoban was last, finally standing on his toes to nip at Miroka's ear as she sat at her station. Her eyes widened at the gesture, with Hoban snickering and hurrying out.

Gryzzk shook his head at the scene before addressing the remaining bridge team. ""I know this is unusual, but what you do is important. I admit I feel better knowing that you are all here ensuring the safety of this company when most are asleep. Thank you.""

Gryzzk went to his quarters and settled at his desk to take note of something that hadn't been there when he left - a rectangular planter the width of his desk sat there, filled with dirt in four separate sections, each with a small packet of seeds affixed to it. He recognized one almost immediately as from Lord A'Kifab, no - his inner voice reminded him that it was Lady Ah'nuriel's land now. The others were different - one section brought memories of Montana and a ride on a horse. The third was completely foreign to his nose, but the last seemed to be similar to Vilantia, but slightly harsher. There was a small note; ""Grow something pretty.""

A sense of relaxation filled him as he opened the packets individually. The Vilantian packet contained rose seeds, but that was where his knowledge ended. He felt a strange calm as he took the seeds from four worlds and slowly sank them into the dirt and added a small amount of water to each. While he was confident with the Vilantian plants, there was less certainty with the other ones. Still, the work left him feeling cautiously optimistic, and he took to his bed that night with a calm he'd never felt while aboard the ship before.",25,1749826849.0,HFY,10,1.0,False

I was the only one there and the barista was cleaning up while making my drink. She was wiping the counter, rinsing out rags, and it looked (to me) like she was cleaning the inside of the sink. 

She then placed the lid on my coffee without washing her hands. 

I'm a bit of a germaphobe, I was grossed out. It wasn't the kind of shop where lids are kept out either, I had to ask her for another. I didn't want to be mean so I politely asked ""Sorry, could you please wash your hands and get me a new lid? I just saw you cleaning the sink."" She rolled her eyes, quickly washed her hands and got me a new lid, then said ""I wasn't washing the sink. I was only wiping the counter."" 

I apologized for the mistake and left.

Was I wrong? I tried to be nice but I guess there's not really a nice way to lowkey call someone dirty? My dad thinks I was acting silly, and that any place you get food/drinks is likely filthy. My boyfriend agrees with me, especially because the cafe was located inside of a hospital.

1lai44i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicWomen/comments/1lai44i/guilt_and_regret_following_surgical_intervention/,Guilt and regret following surgical intervention for chance of conception,"I’m struggling with guilt and regret following surgical intervention on my uterus to remove a large fibroid.

Forgive me for the long, seemingly dramatic post. My heart is so heavy and I’m desperate for connection and understanding. 

I struggled with painful, heavy periods most of my life. The last 5 years in particular have been traumatic. I bled for 1.5 years straight. And then carried on bleeding for months at a time with few breaks. I hollered and cried out in pain. I spent most of my days soaked in blood, weeping. Doctors didn’t help. People didn’t understand. Even other women couldn’t relate. I stopped being able to work and live my regular life due to overwhelming symptoms. My entire life revolved around managing these symptoms and working to heal myself. 

I grew up Catholic and went to Catholic schools, so even if I’m not attending church regularity as an adult, I have some deep programming that I see as my truth. A major part- that women and men can procreate and children are a blessing. That a family is the foundation of everything and your body is a temple. 

But I can’t escape my thoughts on humanity in the state of nature- the state that God created us in. Perfect, without flaw and disease and disorder. My inability to conceive feels like a message, but it hurts my feelings. Every day.
Did God not approve of my marriage? Of my life choices? Of my meals? My friendships? My lack of community? Did he not trust me with the task of guiding a child through this life? 
All kinds of people have children so what is it about me? Am I being punished for those years the doctors had me on birth control? It must be a sin. I didn’t know at the time.
People who eat McDonald’s 3 times a week have babies. teenagers have babies. Addicts have babies. People who don’t even want children, have babies. Abusers have babies. What have I done wrong? what can I do?

I spent most of my life working in childcare. I helped hundreds of families raise their children. I cared for others children as if they were my own. It’s like I was in training for a position I would never get. 

I tried all kinds of natural methods. I worked with the TCM doctor, I worked with a birth and life doula, I worked with healers. I went to the doctor and I let them run the tests. Poke and prod me. Examine my most intimate parts. 
I changed my diet. I cut out sugar, coffee, meat. I added meat again, I only ate spelt bread. I fasted. I detoxed from medicine and prescriptions. I took the supplements. I adjusted the supplements. I threw my hands up and let myself enjoy things. I relaxed and let myself live. I cut toxic relationships, I made quality friendships, I worked on my marriages flaws and hardships, I practised boundaries. I went back to church. I prayed, I prayed, I prayed. 

I already receive a lot of feedback when I touch on my feelings out loud— “you needed this” “don’t feel bad, the doctors and surgeons are there to help”, “you didn’t do anything wrong”, “you’re not a failure”, “God sent these people to help you”… 

I guess I’m looking for understanding. Perspective on infertility and the reasons for not being able to conceive. It’s been 10 years of trying. I’m tired.
They opened me up and scraped against my womb. Strangers laid hands on me that I will never know, because I was unconscious. 
God gave us the power and ability to heal ourselves through him, and I couldn’t. So what does it mean? What is God’s reason for banning me from my truest desire?

I’m looking for any perspective, no matter how brutal or hard to hear… on WHY.

It’s been a week since surgery. I struggle to look at the incision. I struggle with the aftermath of daily injections and this tightness around my womb. This hideous scar as a reminder of my failures. This reminder that my husband and I have not received this blessing the natural way.
I struggle knowing that IF I get pregnant, my baby will have to be delivered by c-section, pulled from my insides and handled by hands that don’t know or love us. I’ve been referred to IVF clinics and I know this isn’t the path for me. I struggle with regret wondering if God doesn’t approve of my decision to go through surgery as well. 
I’m struggling.

Please, anything.

1lai2os,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanayconfessions/comments/1lai2os/mahal_kita_anak_but_mommy_needs_to_breathe/,"Mahal kita anak, but mommy needs to breathe","Postpartum emotions should not be taken lightly. Akala ko parang OA lang nung dalaga pa ako, not until I've experienced it myself. We moms need support, we cannot do all things alone. It will wear us down.

As a first time mom, aware naman ako na overstimulated na ako - nagsisimula nang marindi sa iyak niya sa tuwing mawawala ako sa paningin niya (example: iihi lang saglit), tapos need sundan ang mga routines kahit nakakapagod na kasi ganun at ganun na lang ginagawa namin araw araw, naiistress na rin ako sa multi tasking (gusto ko maglinis ng bahay, pero kahit saan man ako pumunta, nakasunod palagi, gusto nagpapabuhat. Pag magtututor online kailangan nasa lap ko siya kasi gusto nakadikit sakin, iiyak pag hindi). Nasa work si husband, at ayoko obligahin si FIL na magbantay sa kanya kahit wala naman siyang ginagawa madalas. In short, no days off ang pagiging nanay. 

Burnt out nako. Too tired to complain to my husband na pagod na ako, though sinabi ko naman sa kanya na siya na muna mag asikaso sa anak namin kasi I can't deal with her pa, cause I am trying to self-regulate. Too tired to get angry kasi nagkakalat na lang ng pagkain, hindi na kumakain, naglalaro na lang. I know that is normal for them, pero shempre there's a part of me na napapagod na maglinis ng pinagkainan, magpulot ng mugmog, magmop ng floor 3x a day. So, I just watched her do her thing while waiting on hubby to pick and clean her na. Drained na drained na ako. Nakakaguilty maramdaman mga ganitong emotions. I know well that I should not take out whatever I am feeling right now on her. Need ko lang talaga huminga kahit 15 mins. 

Edi ito na, matutulog na kasi gabi na e, iyak na naman ng iyak, kasi gusto niya ako magpatulog sa kanya, at hindi ang daddy niya. Nagrereklamo na si hubby na kunin ko na siya kasi ako raw ang gusto at hindi siya. Tinatry kong pakalmahin sarili ko kasi natitrigger na postpartum rage ko. Ang tumatakbo sa utak ko kanina, *konting minuto lang naman hinihingi ko mula sa kanya, hindi ba kaya i-hold muna yung fort? Ang dumi-dumi pa ng bahay, kailangan ba ako na lang lahat palagi? Ano ba yan, wala akong maasahang iba sa pag-aalaga sa bata*, then I just snapped... Naidabog ko yung drawer paloob sa cabinet sa bwisit ko. Natakot yata siya sa ginawa ko. Natakot din ako sa ginawa ko. Hindi niya pa ako kinakausap. Tulog na si baby ngayon. Andito ako sa sala nagpapalamig ng ulo. Marami pang tupiin at lilinisin kaya baka dito na muna ako. 

Dati kaya kong kontrolin emotions ko, ngayon ang hirap. Andali ko nang magalit. Gusto kong magwala. Magsisisigaw. Magbato ng gamit para lang marelease lang itong unwanted emotions na ito. I tried holding it down together, but I cannot do it alone. I am trying to rationalize it, analyze it, that's why I am writing right now while drinking coffee. Mahaba pa ang gabi para mag-isip kung paano sasakses sa buhay.

1lai2fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lai2fj/the_breadwinners_smile/,"""The breadwinners smile.'","The coffee pot hissed its final sputter of the morning brew as I poured a fresh cup into a floral mug marked “#1 Househubby.” It was a gift from Judy on our anniversary—our fifth one. The letters had faded a little in the dishwasher, like most things around here. Still worked, though. Still warmed my hands. Just like she used to.

Outside, the pale orange sun crept lazily through the chem-haze sky. Birds chirped through the artificial ozone hum as I stood on our porch and waved to the other house-husbands on Cedar Avenue. Walter in his apron, Bill walking their barkless terrier, Mr. Jennings with his perfect hedges.

Everyone was smiling. They always smiled.

I smiled too, because I was happy. I had everything a man could want in 1957: a polished home, a loving wife, a government-issued companionship certificate, and an assigned neighborhood in New Hope, Arizona—The Model Community of Tomorrow.

No kids, of course. That wasn’t our place. Reproduction was restricted to authorized genetic partners. Science had replaced the nursery, and state-rationed affection had replaced the biological clock.

But that was the price of peace, they told us. And Judy—my beautiful, brilliant, titanium-spined Judy—was a Senior Design Coordinator at the Western Robotics Bureau. She was building the future, while I waxed the floors and made beefless stroganoff.

And I was happy.
I was happy.

Until Judy started coming home… different.


---

It began subtly. She’d walk through the door with her lips tight and eyes colder than the refrigerium unit. She stopped kissing me on the cheek. Stopped asking about my day. Some nights she’d just stare out the window for hours, like she was waiting for something she couldn’t explain.

At first, I thought she was just tired. Work stress. Even in a matriarchal utopia, stress was real. But then she started talking in her sleep.

Words like “Override.” “Containment breach.” “Primary male exposure.”

I told myself it was work mumbo-jumbo. Tech lingo. Classified stuff. But it didn’t sound like code—it sounded like fear. And Judy was never afraid.


---

A week later, I saw her push Mr. Jennings.

He was just walking by with his trimmers, humming some commercial jingle. Judy had come home early—said a system failure let them off. I was trimming the hedges, she was walking up the drive. Mr. Jennings said something polite. She stared at him for a second. Then shoved him—just enough to make him stumble.

She didn’t apologize. She didn’t even look back. Just walked inside and slammed the door.

Later, over dinner, she acted like nothing happened.

“What’s in the casserole?” she asked, like it was any other Thursday.


---

The other men noticed. How could they not?

In the park, during our daily Husband Social, Bill whispered to me behind his government-issued mustache.

“Yours too, huh?”

“What do you mean?”

“She snapped at me. Judy. Said I should stop eavesdropping on classified chatter. I was just trying to say hello. Said my scent was off.” He looked around nervously. “It’s not just her. It’s all of them.”

“Who?”

“The wives.”


---

By the end of the month, four wives had been “relocated” for “special reassignment.” The men they left behind didn’t get any answers. Just new companionship assignments and complimentary sedatives.

I stopped taking mine. Flushed them down the old guest toilet.

That’s when the dreams started.


---

In them, I saw a version of Judy with glowing eyes and a silver tongue. She stood over a crowd of kneeling men, dressed in mid-century aprons, holding feather dusters like they were crucifixes. She whispered strange lullabies about “order” and “cleansing.” Her hands dripped mercury.

I woke up gasping, sweat soaking the sheets.

Judy lay beside me, perfectly still. Not asleep. Not blinking.

Just watching me.


---

The next day, I found a crack behind the hallway panel. Nothing major—just a sliver, a shadow where the metal should’ve met the frame. I reached in and pulled out a reel.

An old tape. Labeled only: “Phase 3. Internal: Husbandial Behavioral Conditioning.”

I waited until Judy left. Then I threaded it into the old viewer in the basement. What played wasn’t propaganda or entertainment—it was footage. Hidden camera footage.

Of me.

Doing dishes. Singing in the garden. Petting the neighbors’ dog. Holding Judy’s hand. Dozens of clips, compiled and timestamped.

And then, a black screen with white letters:
“Deviant Subtle Indicators: Subject Showing Resistance. Suggested Escalation: Psychological Pressure. Begin Phase 4.”

I dropped the reel. It cracked underfoot like a dry bone.


---

When she came home that night, I asked her if she loved me.

She blinked. Smiled. “Of course, dear. You’re my assigned partner. You make the best mock roast in New Hope.”

“Not the food, Judy. Me. Do you love me?”

A pause. A second too long.

Then she tilted her head, like I was a malfunctioning toaster.

“Maybe you should lie down. You’re not looking well.”


---

That night, she left a drawer open. A rare mistake.

Inside was a syringe. Small, sleek. Not government-issued. The label had no brand. Just a designation: “HB-Regimen #9.”

I didn’t sleep. Instead, I slipped out into the night.

To Bill’s place.

We sat in his garage, the lights off. A dusty old truck from the Old World sat rusting in the corner—illegal to drive, but somehow comforting.

“Whatever’s going on,” he said, “it started after the Solar Summit. I think they did something to them.”

“The wives?”

“No, us. Our food. Our water. Our meds. I think we were experiments. They perfected compliance. We’re not husbands—we’re pets.”

I didn’t want to believe him.

But my wife had started sleeping with her eyes open.


---

The next morning, Judy kissed me on the cheek.

“Have a good day, sweetheart,” she said, voice sweet like nothing had happened.

But her hand lingered too long on my shoulder. Like she was holding me down. Like she was making sure I stayed domesticated.

As she walked out, I noticed something beneath her skirt—a faint, almost imperceptible glow from under her skin.

Like circuitry.


---

I confronted her that night.

“I saw the footage. I found the needle. What am I to you, Judy?”

She didn’t deny it. She didn’t scream. She just stared, then said: “You were perfect. Once. But you’re slipping. They’ll notice. And if they notice, I can’t protect you.”

“From what?”

“From them.”

“Who are they, Judy?!”

She sighed. Sat down at the dinner table, folded her hands like a robot rebooting.

“There was a war. You don’t remember. They made sure of that. The Gender Conflict of '39. You were sixteen. You and I were in that bunker together, remember? Hiding in the school basement.”

“No… no, that was a drill.”

“It wasn’t. And we lost.”

She looked up, eyes glassy with memory or programming—I couldn’t tell.

“The scientists said we were better built for leadership. Less prone to violence. More adaptable. Efficient. Logical. They said the world needed order. They promised the new age would be kinder. That we’d preserve what was left of the men… if we could control them.”

“You’re controlling me?”

“I loved you, Michael. I begged them to assign me to you. I’ve done everything to protect you. But you’re deviating now. You’re remembering. And they’re watching.”

“Then let them watch.”

“You don’t understand. If they think you’re unstable, they’ll take you away. Deconstruct you.”

“What does that mean?”

Her silence was answer enough.


---

I ran that night. Out of the neighborhood. Past the glowing hedges, the ever-smiling husbands, the watchful eyes in the sky. I found an old maintenance hatch in the industrial zone and crawled through it like a rat.

There were others. Men like me.

Some mad. Some broken. Some building something.

A resistance.

They call it “The Forgotten Order.” They remember the war. They remember the vote that never came. They remember freedom.

And I remember too now.

I remember that Judy held my hand in that school basement, not because she was told to, but because she wanted to. I remember that we carved our names into the chalkboard. That she said, “Whatever happens, we stick together.”

That was before the pills. Before the rewiring. Before peace meant obedience.


---

It’s been six months. I live underground now. I write on scraps. I remember every detail I can.

Sometimes, I see Judy on the old pirated broadcast feeds—smiling, giving tech presentations, selling the illusion of harmony.

But her eyes flicker, just once in a while. A twitch. A tear. A tremble.

She remembers too.

And maybe one day, when the world cracks wide open, when the house-husbands awaken and the synthetic sky peels away, maybe we’ll meet again in that basement.

Not as controller and controlled.

But as partners.

As rebels.

As humans.

I briefly considered setting the house on fire but decided against it because I have a lot to do today. 

I got my leaf blower thinking I could blow it out the back door from a safe distance but as soon as I fired up the blower, the creature began to move! This wasn't going as expected and I needed a better plan. 

Next steps were getting some large hardcover  books and throwing them from 6' away. It took a few books but I managed to contain it under a pile.

Some are lucky to get one offer during the first weekend or they sit a couple weeks before going pending with an at list or slightly under list price offer. It seems that buyers right now are seeking community. They want to be close in to the action where they can easily access coffee shops/bars/restaurants. They want the homes to be dialed in and don't have a lot of tolerance for doing projects. I've also noticed that some buyers are really sensitive to competitive situations. They'd rather not make an offer than to play the game. But again, these are just my circle of current clients. 

Buyers who are currently in the market, what's your experience? If you're open to sharing details like price point, what you're looking for, and area, that would be very insightful!",0,1749826385.0,PDXHomeGuides,0,0.5,False

1lahwsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lahwsq/confused_about_fwb_situation/,Confused about fwb situation,"Three months ago, I (f21) went on a date with a guy (m25). I didn’t really have an expectations going into it and I was pleasantly surprised. We went to two bars and talked for a long time and then he asked if I wanted to go home with him. I’m not really looking for a one night stand, and I had procrastinated some work I had to finish that night. He asked if he could come with me and I can do the work and then we can watch a movie. I was a bit drunk and wanted to keep hanging out so I said yes. We went back to my apt and during the movie we got a bit more comfortable and he kissed me. We started making out and then he asked if I was tired and I said I was, he said he was too so we got ready for bed. 

He asked if he should go home and I told him I wanted him to stay. We did some stuff in the morning but not all the way. He bought me coffee and I walked with him to his place and we kissed goodbye. He texted me asking if I got home okay, at this point he was a pretty good texter, basically always texted me first, etc. 

We met at the same bar about a week later and he went home with me again, and this time we did have sex. He slept over and we got coffee again, but i didn’t walk all the way back with him. 
He texted me later that same day. Afterwards he sent me a long text saying he thinks I’m funny, smart, cool, and likes hanging out with me but he just got out of a serious relationship and isn’t looking  for anything serious rn. He apologized for not communicating that sooner and said he understands if I don’t want to see him again but he’s really like to. I said i like hanging out and I’m okay with casual for now. 

The next time we went to a bar by his place, only one round, (also every time we have gotten a bottle of wine before we went home), and then drank wine on his roof. I’ve seen him 6 times now and every time we’ve stayed at each others places and kissed goodbye, whatever but after the third time we haven’t gone to a bar, and he texts me less often (waiting days) and this has been making me feel bad about myself. It makes me feel like I’m sl*ting out myself or something. Is there a way I can bring this up to him? Or should I just move on. I really enjoy hanging out with him and the sex is probably the best I’ve ever had, I just can’t get over why I get so emotional.

Tl;dr my fuckbuddy/fwb/situationship has been gradually putting in less effort and it makes me feel like a sl*t",0,1749826277.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False
1lahwfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHCreditCards/comments/1lahwfg/miles_visa_sig_suspended_for_duplicate_application/,Miles+ Visa Sig Suspended for “Duplicate Application”,"Hi all, anyone has experienced this issue with UB? 

For context, I was approved with Rewards Plat Visa and Cashback Titanium MC last August 2024. Because I reevaluated my goals for miles earning CC, I applied on June 1 and got approved for Miles+ Visa Sig on June 3. I got my physical card on June 11. 

I used my card with small transactions first until the issue today, June 13. I used my card at Jollibee at 8AM and it was fine. I attempted to use my card on Grab at 11AM. Received OTP successfully, processed, but was declined. Attempted again still declined so used another card. I tried again later in the afternoon with Bo’s Coffee and declined. 

I called CS immediately, and lo and behold I was just told that my account was suspended and that I should apply again. I was very confused and no clear answer was offered other than what was indicated on their “system”. 

I called CS again later in the evening to further clarify the matter. I was told once again the same thing, however, now added information that the system detected a “duplicate application” on my account. I further asked why since I clearly sent only one application for Miles+. It was not until towards the end of the call where CS gave further information that I was not yet qualified for a “secondary” card because policy states that I have to wait 1 year before I can apply another one. Hence the reason for the card suspension and the system only now has “corrected”.

I understand banks will have their policies on second cards, but I just could not find that in writing for UB nor in their most recent Terms and Conditions: https://www.unionbankph.com/cards-terms-and-conditions?report=4

Currently, I have emailed CS further clarification on the policy in writing and if reconsideration is possible. If not, it is what is and sharing for others’ information. ",1,1749826250.0,PHCreditCards,1,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

There isn’t a single team in the NBA who bounces back from a loss better than the Thunder, friends. In fact, their last ""bounce back game"" against Indiana (Game 2) resulted in a win by 16 points. Given what’s at stake here, I wouldn’t be surprised if Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has a game of record-breaking magnitude. Oklahoma City has only lost two games in a row twice all season – I say they bag a healthy victory here. My money’s on the Thunder to cover.

I just recently started dating this year after being single for about 18 months. 

I met an awesome guy a few months ago, and we’ve been having a lot of fun. Let’s call him Henry. The sex is awesome, we have a lot in common, and I really like him. A couple of months ago, we told each other we weren’t sleeping with anyone else and have been seeing each other at least 3-4 times a week. We have also been sleeping over with each other more often too. 

He’s always wanted to have a FFM threesome. He has done the MMF route many times in the past. I was dating a married couple before we became exclusive, which he knows about and knows that was a great experience for me. He asked me if I would be open to dating a woman with him and was really respectful in finding someone for us. He told me about her as soon as they matched on an app, asked if we could meet her together, and arranged everything for us. They did end up meeting 1:1 for coffee when I was out of town for a week, but he told me in advance and then shared more about her the next time we hung out. She sounded great. 

We ended up meeting her together and sleeping together. It was a blast. However, I was the first woman she’s been with, and it was both of their first time in a FFM threesome. I tried to lead us all through it and set an example - I complimented her constantly, made sure she was frequently the center of attention, took care of Henry when I could tell he was overwhelmed or not quite getting what he needed, and constantly checked in on everyone throughout the experience. They did a good job of providing me with the same, although there were a couple of brief moments where I felt like the third wheel. I think that’s bound to happen in a first experience though (please correct me if I’m wrong). 

Afterwards, she left and I spent the night with him. We both were more emotionally intimate with each other afterwards than we have been before. We had sex like four more times. It was a really bonding experience and it made me trust him more to see how kind and gentle he was with me during that experience. However, after I left his house and came back to the real world, I have been spiraling and this is where I need some advice. 

I really like him, and I really enjoyed opening our relationship. I’m spiraling because we don’t have any set parameters around our relationship. Yes, we agreed to only sleep with each other or with someone together. But that’s really all we’ve discussed when it comes to our relationship. Now I’m going through all of these spiraling thoughts like what if they start sleeping together without me? What if he was just using me to have a threesome? He’s done nothing to make me believe that this would happen, but I don’t know her as well and wasn’t sure if she was a girl’s girl in the same way as me. 

So here’s where I need some advice: what kind of boundaries work well in nonmonogamous relationships? Are there standard things we should discuss so that things don’t get messy? How can I better vet any other women we bring into the relationship to avoid drama? What am I not considering? 

My ultimate goal is to continue seeing him, exploring nonmonogamy together, and seeing where life takes us. I’m not looking to marry him, but I don’t want to do anything to mess this up. ",0,1749825638.0,nonmonogamy,7,0.5,False
1lahm0f,https://i.redd.it/s5vm75qqhp6f1.jpeg,Re: abusive relationships,"Hello Charlotte, first off love your content. You are truly an inspiration! 

I was watching this video from 4/16/24 and you read a Reddit comment asking how a woman got to this point in an abusive relationship.

Speaking from the point of view from someone who discovered she was in an emotionally and mentally abusive marriage of 11 years, it’s something that comes on slowly. In the beginning they love bomb you. It’s practically like living in a fairytale it’s so perfect and wonderful. The abuse doesn’t show up until you have made some sort of commitment where it’s hard to back out and little by little it gets worse and worse. 

I am going to do voice to text because I am working on a with project right now project right now. And I’m gonna be too lazy to wanna go over this super long story to check for errors plus you’re pretty clever at interpreting other people shares when they’ve said that their English isn’t so great so I’m sure that me being lazy and doing voice to text won’t bother you. I also know that you don’t mind long stories and this one is a doozy.

My story -my ex-husband and I had dated for four years long distance. My mom, who can be a catastrophe at times told me many times that you need to date a guy for a full year and see him in all four seasons to know if he’s abusive or not. She didn’t say this because she thought my boyfriend at the time was being abusive to me, but because she had friends who had been in abusive relationships, she was just sharing what she had learned from them.

To be honest, my mom‘s advice sounded good, however, my boyfriend at the time was from a different country and it was impossible for us to date for a year in close physical proximity and for me to truly see him in those four seasons, so I was not able to keep my mom‘s advice.

I know that there are people who have met long-distance who have had relationships that worked, and like I said, I thought mine was a fairytale come to life. In reality, I was a very insecure person. I had been put down for years by my father for my weight-mind you I was about average , for not being good enough at anything. I considered my parents to be like God, Infinera. I think that’s a phase that we all go through and my self-esteem was quite low.

In the meantime, I was dating this guy from another country. It was exciting adventurous and he was love bombing me. Everything seemed beyond perfect. 

Fast forward, we get engaged 9/11 happens in immigration policies for marriage and other things got much more challenging. In the meantime he had moved to the United States in anticipation of and preparation of our marriage at that point he started having panic attacks and I thought it was because of the immigration stuff or being away from his family. I guess hindsight mean 2020 perhaps that could’ve been assigned to me I tried to take him to counseling, but instead, I ended up going and still never thought that that was an indication that he didn’t wanna get married or wasn’t truly in love with me or that I should be concerned about our future. I was concerned about him. I wanted him to be OK so I supported him through that.

So we get married and had two beautiful wedding ceremonies, one in each country and I thought my dream had come true. Being a people pleaser and him having mentioned several times about wanting to live somewhere warm, after we got married, we moved to Southwest. I was from the Midwest, so I was a good 24 hour drive away from my home my family, my support system., Obviously he had more distance between him and his family, but one sign of an abuser is isolation getting you away from friends and family. Now it was, I who suggested we move there, but he had planted the seed and and I stepped right into it. I guess the naïve the day of being young being in love and wanting to have that fairytale.

Neither of us had a job and we moved there Immediately upon arriving he and I try to get jobs and we both went into a temp agency, I told them that I was willing to do anything clean toilets telemarketing whatever and I got a tub right away he on the other hand asked if they had any jobs at their temp agency would be specifically looking for someone who spoke his language, let alone attempt agency. 

Within a few weeks, I was able to get a teaching job my first real job out of college. I secured us an apartment and I started to financially support us.  

No, super huge red flags yet maybe little pink ones waving in the wind but nothing that really stood out as this is something I need to run away from now. Plus, I was raised Catholic and my parents had the most tumultuous divorce and my mom would still ball out crying at the mention of my father, even though they had been divorced at that point for 14 years. My parents put my brother and I through health with their divorce and my dad‘s 2nd marriage. He married a woman that he knew did not love him in the hopes that one day she would and didn’t consider how that would impact my brother and I and our step sisters. It would’ve taken a lot, the equivalent of an atomic palm blowing up in our marriage for me to step away.

Within six months of marriage, I secured us a nice two bedroom apartment my dad and he had moved my stuff down. And next, he convinced me to lease a brand new turbo car. His dream car. He did not have a job at the time and stupid me just wanted to make my husband happy. He kept taking me to dealerships to look at his dream car and visit his dream car. Obviously it was my choice now I signed the documents, but I can see now the manipulation. 

Next thing that happened was one of his good friends from his home Country moved into the other bedroom of our apartment. Neither of them had jobs, but the Friend did contribute to rent. I know that you will probably guess that they were gay and we’re fooling around when I was at work, but I honestly don’t think so. This Friend is a really nice guy And loves the ladies and is now married and has kids and is still a great guy.

For maybe three or four months, the two of them tried to start a business while I was financially supporting us. I had faith in the two of them, they were very smart charismatic, and they knew their stuff, however, day after day, I would come home and they showed me what they had been working on. They spent a whole week on their logo, another couple weeks on their business card design, and then some more time on the shirts that they would wear And they purchased these things. What they were not doing was coming up with a plan to actually make money or provide a service to anyone just the aesthetics. Being an education major, and not having a knowledge of business that seemed off, but I trusted the two of them over myself because they both had graduated with a business major and I wanted to support my husband‘s dreams. 

At that time, young and naïve I confided in a colleague about what was going on. And the colleague suggested that I quit my job. Tell my husband to get a paying job. I told him he was nuts because if I quit my job, we would then be homeless , I don’t know that I could’ve done that even today being a stronger person, but perhaps I could’ve told him to move out or something. His friend ended up moving out and he ended up getting a minimum wage job, even though he was capable of much more. It was weird, he would go to job interviews and sabotage them and tell me about them as if he was so clever, and the employer was just an idiot. My dad and my stepmother at the time saw through that by the way, my dad was on to his third wife at the time. Believe it or not they are still together and she is so wonderful for him, so giving and kind, but I didn’t really know her very much at the time and didn’t have a relationship where I trusted her holy. And my dad did not have the best track record when it came to relationships, so I kinda just shrugged it off.  
  
A few years in, we purchased a home, really I did, because I was financially supporting us. And he tried to continue with his business ideas while working at his minimum wage job that did not feel right to me either, he was using his bosses time, his bosses Printer, printer paper to work on his own business idea.

There was also another red flag when he turned left on a red light when a car was coming straight at us, he was found completely at fault and he wanted to argue that. In fact, he took me to a lawyer because he was so sure of himself. The lawyer turned to me and asked me what I was thinking when my husband turn left and I was afraid to say what I thought, because I knew that he disagreed with me. The lawyer told me to pretend like my husband wasn’t there and answer the question, which I did From that point on my husband held a grudge against me for the next nine years for not backing him up. In his mind, I should’ve said what he wanted me to say versus what my conscious was telling me I was very hurt by how this affected our marriage, but I am not OK with lying and dishonesty. Which is ironic because I found out that I was married to a huge liar and manipulator.

So, five years into our marriage I had reestablished my home in this new place. I had friends who were like family to me. I had a community, was a member of a church and was really loving what we had built there.

However, my body was trying to tell me that I actually was not in love with all of this. I had chronic neck pain, headaches almost all the time, and I came to the realization that I had a binge eating disorder, but I didn’t make the connection that that was connected to him or to us , but the wonderful thing was that it led me to start getting help finding a community of support and people just like me. 

Then one October day he tells me that he got a job on the East Coast and he was super excited and he was gonna be leaving within the next month to go take that job. I was dumbfounded I was clueless. I had no idea that he was even looking for a job elsewhere and because I wasn’t strong emotionally I didn’t stand up for myself completely. When I shared mine, just meet with him, he said rather casually: you can finish off the school year here while I check out what it’s like to live on the East Coast and see if I like this job and then at the end of the school year, we can decide whether we wanna live in the southwest or East Coast. I found some strength and I replied that if we do that come the end of the school year, we wouldn’t be married any longer and thus I resigned from my job we packed up our entire house and two dogs and moved. We held onto our house there and rented it out.

My two dogs did not eat drink or poop on that entire road trip. I can see now that they were demonstrating what I was absolutely feeling on my insides. Again in a desire to support my husband and a desire to not get divorced, cause that in my mind would be quitting we went on this adventure. Even though it was October, and even though I have a specialty area of teaching (meaning that it would be practically a miracle for there to be a job open in my position let alone me get it. As luck would have it there was a position open and I got the job. It was a brand new school and I was the third teacher that they had hired that year for that position. This explained why there was a job in my specialty area open and why I got it in addition to me being qualified. 

With my salary, I got us a nice apartment again and tried to connect with a community there. I was so focused on next steps that I would talk to him about having kids daily and daily. He would respond that he couldn’t right now cause he thought he might not have a job the next day. For the five years before his excuse for not getting pregnant with that he didn’t make enough yet or he wasn’t doing the job that he wanted yet and I thought he was just putting me off again. After five months of him telling me every single day that he didn’t think he’d have a job in the next day I didn’t believe him and so we got pregnant and then a week later he got fired from his job it was March, I hated my job, I spent the whole hour commute crying in my car to and from work because my job was so difficult and now I was pregnant with a jobless husband in a place where we didn’t have roots and it felt weird to go back to the home, we still owned in the Southwest because we had said goodbye to that community.

So, I convinced him that we should move back home to where my family lived. Again, I got a job right away and had a masters degree so was working at a higher income also. And bought another home for us. It was scary, but at least I was close to my family support.

I can’t even remember if he got a job when we got home. And one of the beautiful things of him not having a job was that after I gave birth and had to go back to work after four weeks that he was able to drive our first born to us every day at lunchtime so I could breast-feed him and still have that connection. His sister came to visit and he made up some sort of story to explain why he wasn’t working at the time. He was secretive with his family as well.

When our first born was a few months old my husband said to me great news, I got my job back in Florida, I fly out tomorrow to sign contracts. I couldn’t believe my ears! I was so mad, so confused and again found strength. I told him that if he thought it was so easy to be a single parent with a newborn working a full-time job that he could take our child with him the next day to sign those contracts and he could figure out how to take care of the child find daycare and work. I left and started driving to my mom‘s house. It’s weird because my mom‘s house was maybe a 20 minute drive away on the highway, but the highway was closed because of construction and then even regular streets had construction and after being on the road for an hour, I still wasn’t even halfway to my mom‘s house. I thought maybe it was a sign. So I called my mom, who I now know is the worst person to call in times of crisis because she is a catastrophizer and told her what was going on. My mom who was stuck on the movie with Sally Field, not without my daughter, cried out now he’s gonna move back to his country and take your child and he’s gonna get full custody because you abandoned your child and I’m never gonna see my grandchild again! This makes me laugh today. What a ridiculous thing to say. But, I took it as a sign and I turned around. When I got home, he told me that he told his boss that he could not come the next day and that they ended up working it out so that he can still work the job, but from our home and have to travel there at times I felt like a victor. I felt like I had done something to save our family by making that stance, even though I didn’t carry through.

So we continued on, but things were weird with the finances. I was financially supporting us, completely. He would buy groceries for himself and pay for those, but that was about it. And he would tell me that he was getting paid in iPads. Meaning that his employer was giving him an iPad instead of giving him money. One time I threw the iPad in the snow And said I can’t pay our mortgage with an iPad and he pointed out how erratic I was acting. Mind you he was calm through all this. That’s what abusers do too. They say the most conniving heart wrenching things to tear you down, and they say it in the calmest Manner and it builds up in you and you explode and then you look like you’re the nut job.

So he continues with this job in at times he needs to go there for work. But most of the time he would only tell me the day before he had to leave, and he never knew how long he had to be gone for. Maybe two weeks, maybe four weeks maybe more. So here I was with my child and his dad would come and go in my child and I never knew when his father was returning and his father would go 34 days without even calling us. I felt so alone. You can’t imagine how alone I felt. Even though I was close to home and not a countryside away I was still enough of distance from my parents and my family and hadn’t made deep friendships yet. And I just kept marching along and trying to make my marriage work, trying to be the best mom.

When my first born was maybe two years old, they started exhibiting behavior problems. Dr. Phil points out that things like that happen and we focus on the squeaky wheel, but the squeaky wheel is just the indication that something else is going wrong. Just like my eating disorder was trying to tell me that something was wrong. So again, I sought out counseling for me to support my child and again continued to grow.

When my first born was about three, I became pregnant with our second child, and my husband would refuse to tell his boss that I was pregnant. Weird, right? I kept insisting that he tell him so that he wouldn’t be on one of those work trips when I had to go to the hospital. He explained it away, saying That if he told him that I was pregnant that that could put his job at jeopardy. That argument makes absolutely no sense, but at the time I guess I was grasping for straws and thought OK I guess that makes sense. Not sure what that was about, would love for you guys on Reddit to Psychoanalyze it.

Then, at the beginning of the next school year, I gave birth to our second born. I was hoping to have at least six weeks maternity leave this time and had FMLA, which would’ve helped with that a month after our second child is born, my husband comes to me, excited and tells me that he got a new job in Europe, not where his family is mind you an entirely different country with an entirely different language, and that he was going to be leaving within the next couple weeks to move there and do that job. Again, he said I will go and work there while you live here with the kids and come the end of the school year. We’ll see where we want to live. I exploded and again said how do you expect me to raise two children on my own here working a full-time job I was scared to be a single parent and I was effing married, so why should I be living like a single parent? He threw back at me that I was the one who made us move back by my family and they are there to support me and I brought this up upon us. And I was so scared and confused that somehow that made sense to me? Now my mom was 20 minutes away. My dad was 40 minutes away and they both were working full-time, so they were pretty much of no support to me. They couldn’t be again. I said to him that if he left and I stayed back that come the end of the school year that we would be divorced.

So I contacted my school district and took maternity leave for the rest of the school year. We did not rent our house this time and our neighbor was gonna check on it and maintain the yard so it looks like someone was home. I started learning a new language. I started reading every book I could get my hands on about Being an extra patriot, moving your child to a new country. I tried to learn about all the opportunities for children there so that my first born wouldn’t be dramatically negatively affected by this.

I know this seems petty of me but packing. What’s the absolute worst. And I laugh while I say this. Imagine being one month postpartum and having to pack for clothes for the next six months which covers spring winter and fall, which covers me losing weight and which includes my second born growing through those months and having many different sizes of clothes to pack for them. 

We flew into his family’s country first and we were supposed to stay there just for a little bit before moving on to our new home. After maybe a week, he tells me that we cannot move onto our new home that he has to go ahead to get things ready and we have to stay behind. He did not know how long it would be And one week turned into two turned into four turned into maybe six weeks. Enough I said it’s time for us to come and for us to be a family. So his parents drove me and our two children and all of our belongings to our new home in this New country and we don’t start out at our apartment. We go on a mini vacation to a fun hotel with a pool and stuff. This was a form of gaslighting. I realize now when his parents left, we still didn’t go to the apartment, we went to another hotel where I had no kitchen, no refrigerator and was supposed to feed myself and my two children three meals a day with this limitation.

The apartment we were supposed to be living at was really the apartment of his colleague. It was a three bedroom apartment and we were supposed to rent one room and share it together however, after I got to this new country, I was told that the roommate did not want us to ever be there at the same time That he realized me and the kids would be a burden to him, and since it was his home he held all the cards. This man also had two children, but they lived in my husband‘s home Country also so I don’t know if there was any sexual relationship between my husband and him Again he seemed like a manly guy anytime I met him so there was nothing there to make me think that that was a possibility. I just trusted my husband this guy who had his three bedroom apartment to himself didn’t want to be encroach upon by a family with a newborn Who cries and stuff and a four year-old. 

you might be wondering why the roommate would not be at the apartment ever, well this is because their job required them to periodically go to North Africa at times.

So this is the insanity that he spun-every time the roommate was coming back home from North Africa, the kids and I had to be gone. Often we were told within a days notice and I had to pack up our stuff and head out for a 7 Hour drive to go stay with his family. Again, I never knew how long I would have to be gone for maybe a week maybe two maybe four maybe six and he wouldn’t even tell me when we were with his family how long we had to be gone or when we could come back. 

It was absolutely horrible doing those drives. I would try and wake up and leave at 4 AM. That way my second born, could sleep for a lot of the car ride, but at some point in the car ride, my second born would wake up, be hungry I’d stop and feed them And then they wouldn’t want to go back into the car seat. Who would want to be stuck in a car seat for seven hours, not being able to move around and play and what not. So at some point for that journey, my second child would scream bloody murder for over an hour in the car and my first born, was in the back next to them trying to keep their sanity and stay distracted with an iPad. there were no streaming services, no YouTube in the car, just little kids games. The three of us were absolutely miserable.

After being sent away three or four times I told my husband that’s enough this is not working out, we need to get our own apartment. This is not working. There are strict laws in the country. We were living that if you were not there on an official capacity , a.k.a. legally that it was very, very difficult to rent an apartment so we would have to rent an apartment as vacationers. My husband insisted that it would be way too costly to get an apartment and that he had a better idea. Perhaps instead of getting an apartment I could take my kids on a trip. I told him that made no sense because one week in a hotel is the cost of one month in an apartment, but he appealed to my adventurous side and my desire to see the world and convinced me to book a trip the next time. The next time the kids and I had to go I booked a trip in the Alps and my first born and I took ski lessons and it was exciting and fun and it was also the last time that I was permitted to take the kids on a trip because guess what, it was too expensive. It was approaching the summer months and my husband said that it was time to decide whether we were going to stay there in Europe or come back to our home in the Midwest. I emphatically said that there really was no point of discussion because we couldn’t even afford an apartment in this country, we were only paying 250 a month for the apartment we were staying at his parents supplied the car. His parents were paying for the car insurance. I could not legally get a job, if he was fired from his job, he could not legally get a job. There was absolutely no point of staying. There was nothing to discuss. And then he dropped the bomb. He said oh yes, we can afford it because we had €15,000 in the bank. This was the moment my eyes were opened the clouds we’re pushed aside and I could finally see things clearly. He had been getting paid in decent amount all this time we could have afforded to stay in our own apartment. I didn’t have to drive to his families home every time on the drop of a dime because his roommate didn’t want us there. He had been lying and manipulating the entire time and I had practically no say in our life in our kids lives. I was empowered and so angry, I insisted that we go to counseling. I said that what he was doing was and controlling, he refused to get help, and I gave him the ultimatum that if he did not get that we were done.

I was the person who ended up telling his family. We were getting divorced. His mom begged me not to told me that it was gonna hurt the kids, told me that in her day women just fold it over and went on, when she said this, I had an image of a woman being chopped with a machete along her waist, and that she was folded over with only a string of flesh, keeping her together and walking around and trying to make it through life like that. I told her I couldn’t do that and that it would be more harmful for my children to live in a family where abuse was acceptable. That they also would either to learn into abusers or marry anyone. I said goodbye to my family over there, which was very difficult because I knew I probably wouldn’t see them much if ever again the most beautiful thing that happened was that my husband‘s maternal grandmother, when I told her we were getting a divorce she said I don’t know what happened, but I know it was his fault and she told me she loved me so much and looked me in the eyes when she said that and she squeeze my arms tightly, even though it’s not coming to hug someone in that country, and she kissed me and hugged me. that was so validating what a wonderful woman I came home. I did not have a paycheck. I was on food stamps. I had a mortgage. It was difficult, but I was finally going in the right direction and I knew things were gonna get better for me and my kids. There was a lot of crazy shit after that. For example, when we had our first mediation with the lawyers, he had arrived the night before from the European country to tell me that he wanted 50-50 custody of the kids and was moving back to the Midwest. My family and friends and I would’ve never guessed that he would do that. I think it was a ploy to not have to pay child support.My main focus with the kids, taking care of the kids, protect protecting the kids from abuse. protect my kids from the instability of him being there or not being there and coming and going and not knowing how long he’d be away and not calling when he was away I knew that it would be extremely difficult for me to support my two kids on my income alone, but I did not fight for child support because protecting them was the most important. We agreed upon him getting them on the weekends and on Wednesdays also. And the condition was that if he missed his weekend time with them that that is when he would have to pay child support a certain stipend for the weekend. At that point, he said that he didn’t want that stipend to be attached to Wednesdays, so the Wednesday was optional, depending on whether he wanted to take them or not. 

I bear down, I started going to meetings for victims of domestic abuse, and kept continuing to read and grow and become stronger. I had two other women that I had met at the domestic abuse meetings, rent rooms from me to help supplement the mortgage. I am many years away from that day of finding out that my husband was abusing me verbally mentally emotionally. And we have a cordial relationship. He admitted to me that he realize that marriage just was not really for him. I appreciated that concession. I don’t fall over our lost relationship. I know that I did as much as I could and it’s OK that he wasn’t able to be or do more. And he has a relationship with the kids, and they know who he is. And they love him, no matter what he’s willing to provide to them as a father or not. For example, when my second born was five years old, my second husband and I were in a custody battle with his ex-wife, which is a whole another ball of smelly potatoes and she was fighting for 50-50 custody. My second born brought up the idea of being 50-50 also and their father said that he lived too far away for that even though he was working from home, he chose a home that was an hour away from us. In the summer, then, my second born, pointed out that because there was no school or daycare or whatever to run to that they could do 50-50 because their father would not have to rush them back an hour away to go to school. My second child kept bringing this up to their father again and again and again, and he kept pushing the idea away. I remember the day that child came home and told me that their father would not take them 50-50 and see how deflated they became because they realize that their father really was not interested in being with them. And my first born, already knew who their father was without me having to say a word and  the three of us held each other in a long embrace. They both are doing quite well, so you know. My first born is of dating age and so far I’ve liked every single one of their picks for a mate. And my second born is the me I wish I was when I was a kid. So strong of mine and body and spirit. They know who they are, and they would never let anybody knock them down or treat them like shit like I allowed.

Now I tell you, I don’t regret the 11 years of being married, because without them, I would not have had my two wonderful children. And sometimes my mind tries to figure out what was really going on. Part of me thinks my husband was homosexual because after giving birth, he rarely touched me and would say it was because my body disgusted him. One of his ex-girlfriend’s after our divorce reached out to me and we met for coffee and I mentioned this to her and she said that he had no problem having sex with her. Who knows? He’s dating another woman, a very nice woman, and I have nothing against him nor her.

Another interesting thing is that he is loaded. He owns a Porsche a Tesla and a few other nice vehicles and even purchased a Tesla for his parents. And his house is worth much more than the house that my husband and I own I honestly think that all of those years when I was financially supporting us that he was taking his income And putting it in account in another country, for what? I have no idea maybe he knew it is heart of hearts that he couldn’t do the long con forever and that eventually I might leave him. I don’t care honestly. Sure my life would be easier if I had Extra money, but I would rather be in a loving relationship with a husband who respects me and putting my kids first was the right decision.

1lahjv1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lahjv1,"Sculptor 078S SSP MP Review, Upgrades, How to go beyond upper limit","As one of the Sculptor 078S pre-order users, I finally 'completed' this grinder a few days ago, the last piece being the 78mm SSP MP Red Speed Burrs. I strongly encourage you to read this entire post if you want to utilize your 078S(or 078SSP) to its full potential—or if you're still deciding about a potential purchase.

Background: After trying many brands, I settled on Onyx Southern Weather and their Roaster's Choice subscriptions, i.e., light to medium-light roasts modern style coffee. Brew to espresso about 7:3 usually. Currently also own ZP6, P64 SSP MP. 

What I wanted: I originally envisioned the 078S to complement my P64 by primarily making modern espresso and milk drinks. However, I was not satisfied with its factory burrs, it looked good, but the taste has been very chocolaty, bendy, and earthy. Kind of a waste of good coffee beans since I know how good the same beans can be through ZP6 and P64.

Minor issues and my solutions: 
1. Lack of a portafilter holder that doesn't impede the dosing cup. Solution: The Sculpted Dock 2.0.
2. Dial is a bit difficult to line up. Solution: Magneto 2.0(tip broke off but I painted a mark using nail polish)
3. Popcorning and beans sticking on the slope. Solution: Magnetic Hopper V2 (both were vastly reduced, look integrated, easy to clean). Note: Chamfer the inner front edge of your hopper cover to maintain a smooth opening.

How I like it now: So far I'm only about over 10 espresso shots(18-22g) and a few brews in. Didn't feel the urge to burn through over $100 of coffee just to season it. However I did notice some sweet spot shifts as I was dialing, so it is your choice. 
That being said, I can say for sure it is worth the upgrade to me; the results aren't really comparable. The acidity and flavor are sparkling and interesting, with a decently robust body, and a good aftertaste. Flavor definition is not as high as 64mm MP, but the trade-offs/improvements are very welcome for its purpose(perhaps more MP than 64mm MP?). At coarse grind, the particles from 78mm MP seems to have a bit more fines and fewer large particles than the 64mm MP, just an observation though. Appears to have way less of a chance to keep chirping on the last little particle of bean at the end of the grind, a little annoyance from the factory burrs gone.

Do be advised: The SSP upgrade will increase the difficulty of dialing in espresso significantly compared to factory burrs. 
Due to increased friction from Red Speed coating. Don't go below 1100RPM if you do modern SOE, avoid cold start, and slow feeding is preferred.
Alignment: I used Lance's trick, dialed it very close to chirping, pressed all four sides on the dial, and found out it was all equally close to chirping, so I called it good.

The biggest problem - now my Sculptor 078S will not grind coarse enough to do brews or pour-overs: I have been enjoying the Weber Unibasket in a Flair 58 for some time now. It can bring out so much more potential from the coffee... IF your grinder and skills are up to the task. By zeroing fine enough to make light roasted espresso (25-30s lever machine profile with a 7-10s pre-infusion) using such a combo, going back up to 18(the upper limit) will not be coarse enough for most brews. As I would need to go up like ’21’ for some pour-overs.
Therefore, it kills its excellent multi-purpose capability. That has been bothering me since I dialed in my espresso at ~1.0 after the SSP upgrade.

How my modification works: After some studying and thinking, here's what I came up with. In case you aren't aware, the dialing range of 078S is about 1000 microns or 1mm. This fact is important because it means the actual dial under the cover moves 1mm out from 0 to 18! Why does it matter? Because the pin stops at ~12:00 when dialed to 0(fine limit) and ~1:30 when dialed to 18(coarse limit). The pin is actually engaging the stops at different depths between 0 to 18, 1mm to be more exact. So how about we make the pin short enough to avoid the coarse limit but still long enough to engage the zero stop?

The mod - How to increase/'break' the upper range/limit of your Sculptor 078S so it can make French press and cold brew while still able to grind fine enough to make espresso(or even Turkish if you want)...while still maintaining the zero stop: *see last picture*
1. After confirming your zero is fine enough for all your needs(see caution), dial to 18 and remove the dial cover.
2. Remove the pin(do remember the hole though), and give the thread a big drop of non-permanent thread locker, such as blue Loctite.
3. Screw the pin back in (all the way), then unscrew it a tiny bit at a time until it is just able to go beyond the coarse limit(counter-clockwise). Put the cover back on, confirm it does go beyond 18 and the pin isn't scratching the stop(further unscrew slightly if needed).
4. Go back to 0 and confirm it does indeed STOP at 0. (Repeat steps 3-4 if it doesn't)

Now you have the ultimate 078S/078SSP that goes above 18 for all your brewing needs! Just don’t go crazy or you will eventually make the rotary burr carrier hit the chassis. Shouldn't need to go beyond more than +7 even if you make cold brew.

Caution : Zero stop still can fail if the pin lossens, so if it goes below 0 when it shouldn't, double check before start the machine...  You shouldn't need to go 0 under normal use or you didn't set the zero fine enough. 

Tips: 
1. The grind setting is at 20 if you reach 0 again
2. Feel free to mark it however you like, I later did a little hash for 19 and two little dots for 0.5s
3. Shim the other directions under the dial cover with ~ 2-3 layers of Gorilla tape if that tiny amount of wobble bothers you
4. Let the glue dry before use
5. Remember whether you left it at extra coarse or espresso setting, or go below '20' after use if you can't trust yourself

Rheumatoid arthritis

Hello. For the past 6 months or so, I've been having stomach issues. I noticed around November, I would have diarrhea about an hour or so after eating certain foods. At first, I thought it was due to coffee or greasy food but it seems sporadic. I would have diarrhea a few times a week, then it would subside for about a month, and then the symptoms would come back. I went to the doc about a month ago, and told him about the diarrhea but at that point, it had been about a month since the last episode. My blood work was normal. But fast foward to today, I'm starting to get abdominal pain and the diarrhea again. No blood but there's a lot of mucus. Again, normally happens after eating. I don't go multiple times per day but there's urgency. I'm getting worried. My stomach is constantly gurgling. I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis if that's relevant. My CRP was normal but my ESR was 31. I plan to bring it up to my rheumatologist next month but I'm terrified and need something to calm me before my appointment. Thank you.

To be safe, I decided to start taking a simple Vitamin C tablet each morning. I chose a 1000 mg chewable tablet (basically 1 g of vitamin C) because I saw that many adults are recommended around 75–90 mg, so 1000 mg seemed like a generous amount to cover any gaps. I take it with breakfast or my morning coffee.

Initially, I didn’t notice anything different. If anything, I worried it might give me an upset stomach on an empty stomach, but taking it with food has been fine. After about 2–3 weeks, something interesting happened: I typically catch a minor cold or at least feel a sniffle around this time of year, but this time I didn’t. Or if I did, it only lasted a day or two instead of a week. It’s hard to know if the Vitamin C is 100% responsible, but I felt immune and run down far less often. In one case, I did feel a cold coming on, but it never really developed. It’s possible the supplement helped shorten it.

Aside from immunity, I also feel slightly more energetic throughout the day. It’s subtle, but I don’t have that usual mid-afternoon fatigue that I used to get. My skin also feels a bit clearer. I once heard that vitamin C helps with collagen production, so maybe that’s why I noticed a small difference in my facial complexion and healing of any pimples. It’s not dramatic, but I do feel like a little extra glow, especially on days when I consistently take it.

I haven’t had any real downsides. Taking 1000 mg a day hasn’t caused any noticeable problems (like kidney stones), but I did make sure not to exceed the tolerable upper limit (I’ve read up to 2000 mg is still considered safe). Occasionally if I take the tablet without enough water, I get a bit of acid reflux, so I now always gulp it down with water. Otherwise, no issues at all.

Overall, this vitamin C routine feels worth it to me. I’m spending just a few cents a day, and if it prevents even one bad cold or makes me feel even a little healthier, that’s a win. I’ll definitely continue for now and re-evaluate next year. It’s a simple habit that seems to pay off in small ways.

I am a late 20s Kenyan woman who is considering moving back home from NYC, USA with my partner. I have family and friends in Nairobi, where I grew up. I am very familiar with Nairobi living. I have accommodation sorted out already. 

My question is - is there anything (especially for your household) that you regretted not buying in the US before your big move back? For example, it would make sense for me to buy a kiureg (coffee maker) on Amazon here. I would appreciate any insight into this! 

I am also open to recommendations for how to transport my things from USA to Nairobi and general moving advice!

Attempt 3: 18.5g in basket, grind size 12, dripping at 12 seconds, uneven flow, finished at 24 seconds, decided to measure volume and only 40ml came through, wet puck but slightly drier than before, less bitter but still bitter --> make finer next time and manually stop volume

Attempt 4: 18.5g in basket, grind size 11, dripping at 9 seconds, fast and uneven, finish at 29 seconds, 60ml measured, wet puck but still drier that attempts 1/2, less bitter but still bitter --> make finer again next time",1,1749824909.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

For that one commenter about the high five: if I could supply you with a picture, I would, and take the $500. Groceries are expensive these days.


My mom and I got in a fight and I was at my last marble. Our family had just recently gone through a tragedy. She went in the house, I started screaming and smashing things outside. I think I broke a coffee cup and two wine bottles againt some cement.

My neighbors, who don't like us, called the cops and told them they heard gunshots. A police helicopter came overhead, around 15 cops showed up and forced everyone outside at gunpoint. My elderly mom and housemates were forced outside. I was sobbing hoping no one would get accidently shot.
Nothing came of it and the cops left. Before they left I saw the neighbors standing in front near the street, glancing at me, telling the cops ""I have kids, you know?"" and gave the cops a high five before they left. 

I asked the police, before they left, if smashing glass is often confused for gunshots. They said no.

Are my neighbors actions legal?

The other day I phoned an old acquaintance of mine. I haven't spoken to them since a few years before covid, so we were catching up and talking about maybe getting together in person. 

Toward the end of our phone conversation, I asked if they had gotten covid?  Answer was: pause, ""No."" Then I asked if they had been vaccinated, and they went all into a story about yes, they got the first shot, and then they got a booster, and then they got a vaccine injury. It was first tinnitus but then there was a pop and sudden deafness. Somehow they were treated by an ear specialist (it was a little rambling, I'm not sure if there was surgery or what) and now they can hear again with the help of hearing aids.

So like I said, that was basically at the end of our conversation and it left me feeling really sad. I'm sad because I thought they would have seen through the propaganda and avoided the trap. 

And I'm sad because I feel like I don't even want to explain about why we won't be getting together in person any time soon (shedding). And I wouldn't want them to have a heart attack on me if we were trying to meet discreetly.  I mean, if we really did meet just for coffee: what would I even say?

Details on the idea: 

72sq foot bedrooms meeting the ""minimum 70"" requirements, 384sq foot meets ""under 400"" requirement for TH classification. Beds would be lofted with a 6' ""closet"" underneath.

Joists ran along the 16' side, making the center wall load bearing- will have additional beam above to span gaps in the Bath/Bedroom spaces. Roof I'm still leaning towards a 1:1 ratio, but I might have to do a ""Gambrel"" style. The weather in VA varies wildly and I'll be in a wooded area, and it will help with headspace above North-West oriented bedroom. Unsure about open ceilings or small attic storage yet, preferably I'll do 8' ceilings, but I'll probably just buy/build an external storage shed and go open.

Kitchen will catch the ""No counter space"" topic I'm sure, but my idea is to purchase a sink cover and stove topper to use when they aren't needed. Maybe even use a rolling island cart. Wall mounted cabinets for dry food storage.

Bathroom with a standard bath/toilet/sink, stacked washer and dryer in essentially a utility closet with linen storage. Water Heater closet with plumbing access to the bath.

No more woodstove idea, just gonna use a mini-split.

Living area sized for a love-seat and TV, the divider wall length is up for debate so feel free, but I'm sizing/assuming at least a 55"" and entertainment center wall mounted. In lieu on a dining table that I'd only pile stuff on I'll likely opt for a fold-out/collapsible ""coffee table"" to eat at. Or on the possible kitchen island.

I also purchased a bottomless filter on Amazon so that i could visibly see if im doing things right..

So here i am doing my first double shot using my gear. 

14 grams of coffee which made 28 grams of espresso.. 

I don't know how its supposed to taste so i just poured 100ml steamed milk on top.. 

it taste like a latte 🤷🏻‍♂️

We became friends in January and have been getting closer since then. Hes done a lot of subtle flirtatious things, especially when drunk. But I cant tell if the other things he does are something a super kind friend would do or if there is more. 

* I notice he looks at me a lot when we're in a group, even when im not talking
* He helped me tour apartments, drove me back and forth to the real estate office and all the related errands, translated the lease for me (im a foreigner and dont speak the local language that well), and used his car to move all my stuff.
* He walked me home on my first night at my new apartment even though his house is a lot closer.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a photo I took of him and called it the best picture he has.
* He cut my steak during a meal after i had just offered him a bite (he cut the whole steak then took a piece). When a friend pointed out that he's too nice to me, and that's why she thought he likes me, he just laughed and pretended to cut her rice. He also asked who else thinks that he likes me (in our office)
* He pays attention to the things i do or do not like. and he proudly points out that he remembers whenever its brought up, or tells people (like when i put too much spice on my food, he tells them ""oh she really likes spicy food""
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants and i played along, he got panicked and defensive, and has been getting more embarrased by small things when his frineds point them out in front of me
* When a man stalked me and asked me out in the office, i told him how it made me uncomfortable and explained what happened, so he called the guy a creep and went to look for him to make sure hes not around still
* When his friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up and looked at me and smiled and tilted his head as if asking ""Should I?/Do you want to see?""
* His friends might be on to it?
   * When he was asking us what hairstyle to get, his friend emphasised my opinion, even though it was different from the others, and basically told him he should listen to me
   * When me and him were talking in the lounge area one time, his friend (who was on his phone) smiled slightly and got up to leave, even though he didnt have to
   * his other friend makes sure to make space for him to sit next to me sometimes
   * We were grabbing food and his friend told me to take a fruit plate back to the table specifically for my crush, even though his friend couldve just done so himself 

Signs he may not like me:

* He’s deflected my invitation to go walk by the river twice, first time he was hungover and sick, second time he had to work.
* He showed no visible jealousy when the other guy asked to talk to me alone—only commented after i told him i was uncomfortable and acted like he had no clue that this is what the guy was up to. He asked me about the ""creep"" again today, and told me if hes contacted me, he also asked what the creep does and i said i think hes in the medical department, so my crush said ""oh maybe hes rich you dont like rich guys?"" i said not this guy lol
* He’s never taken much initiative to spend time one-on-one, except for twice, once for dinner (everyone else was busy) and another to grab coffee.",0,1749824365.0,Advice,1,0.5,False
