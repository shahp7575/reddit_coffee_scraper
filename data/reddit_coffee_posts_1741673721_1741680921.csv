1j8lrkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1j8lrkx/grandpas_secret_lived_in_the_basement/,Grandpa’s secret lived in the basement,"It was during the spring break of my second year at college that I got a phone call from my uncle Andrew, asking me if I’d be willing to spend a few days over at his house. My grandfather had been sick for a long, tough while, and it’d apparently gotten to the stage that the primary focus now was less so to treat him and more so to just make him as comfortable as possible for the time he had left.

I can’t say I envied anyone in the situation – Grandpa, who’d be getting ready to face eternity in a house that wasn’t his, with no company but a son who he barely spoke to these days, and Andrew, who’s girlfriend died giving birth to their daughter seven months ago and was now tasked with taking care of a dying man on top of that. I’d like to act as if I was making a saintly decision to come over and offer a helping hand out of love for my family, but the truth was that it had been quite some time since I’d spoken to Andrew last, and it had been… forever since I’d spoken to my paternal grandfather. No, I went because I was lonely, unbearably so. I didn’t have any friends to speak of at college, and ever since my mother passed away about a year ago, I’d had no one to talk to at all. I made the decision to help Andrew out of the desperation for proper social interaction. Not like there’d be much to it, anyway. All I really imagined I’d be doing is keeping the baby out of his hair when he was too busy and getting grandpa anything he needed.

Andrew’s house was out in the sticks, at least forty minutes away from the nearest town. My family are mostly dotted around a generally quite rural county, so there wasn’t much in the area but barren roads and the odd building or two. As for the house itself, there wasn’t really much to say about it from the front yard. Just another isolated double story that someone called home. I rang the doorbell, and after a few moments Andrew greeted me. He seemed more or less the same as the last time I’d seen him in the flesh.

“Ah, Nick, how’re you doing? Thanks so much again for coming”, he smiled, his voice nothing if not welcoming. “Nah, not like I had much going on anyway,” I replied, to which he chuckled. “Come on in, throw you jacket on the hanger there. You want some coffee?”

“Sure,” I said.

“Yeah, alright. Have a seat over in the living room. First door to your left.

I took his invitation and made my way over. Now that I was fully inside, I could see that there was more to Andrews’s house than meets the eye at first. It smelled like old books and something faintly musty, the scent of time that slowly claimed everything. The entryway was wide and dimly lit, with heavy curtains blocking out the daylight. There was a quiet rhythm to the house—the creaking of wood beneath our feet, the soft shuffle of Andrew’s footsteps echoing through long corridors. It had the basic interior of a house a lot older than you’d think it was from outside, with aged patterns across the wallpaper and a somewhat ornate type of miniature chandelier suspended from the ceiling. Clashing with these design decisions was the more minimalist furniture and art pieces hanging from the walls. It seemed like someone had taken these measures in order to give the inside of the building a more modern feel, but really, it was a bandaid on a bullethole.

I looked around after reaching my destination. The living room appeared comfortable enough, with an ever so slightly peeling couch, a worn rug, and shelves of books that didn’t seem to have been touched in years. It was the kind of place that felt frozen in time. A bit musty, but lived-in, as though the walls had absorbed the memories of countless years of family life.

A minute or so later, Andrew entered with two mugs. I sipped mine slowly as we exchanged some admittedly uncomfortable small talk. “God, you look so grown up. It’s been, what, two years?” It’d been at least five. This continued for a while until we got to the tasks that’d be at hand for the next number of days.

“I’ll be picking him up from the hospice tomorrow after work. It’ll probably be close to seven before we’ll be back. Chloe’s upstairs having her nap right now, so I’m gonna go and get started on making dinner. In the meantime, you go ahead and make yourself comfortable. There are two rooms free upstairs, you can take your pick.” He rose and clapped me on the shoulders before heading over to the kitchen. “I really do appreciate it, Nick. It’s been rough having to pay for babysitters.”

After going upstairs, I passed what must’ve been Andrew’s room on the way down the hallway, another chamber masquerading as belonging to a home far younger than was the reality, with a double bed and a child’s cot next to it, the baby sleeping soundly inside. I had a mountain of college assignments to get cracking on, so I’d brought my laptop and sociology textbook in my travel bag. That’s how I spent the majority of the evening, taking an hour’s break for dinner.

We had another fairly awkward conversation about what I’d been getting up to in college (spoilers: fuck all.) From my seat at the dining room table, I was able to look out the window at a filth-coated golden retriever pottering around the yard outside. I hadn’t noticed it before; I was surprised that Andrew was able to manage a dog on top of his life as a single father. As I tried to focus on my pork chops, something else caught my eye. There was a door in the corner of the room that I hadn’t noticed before. A small door, almost entirely hidden behind another old bookshelf. I couldn’t see much of it, but there was something about the door that captured my attention, something in the way the wood seemed to shimmer in the dim light, as though it wasn’t quite real.

“Is that a closet?” I asked, pointing.

Andrew looked over his shoulder and then shook her head quickly. “Oh, that? No, just a small little space in the structure I haven’t really found a use for yet.” He smiled, but it was tight, forced. I was going to ask him more before the dog outside started barking loudly. “God, what’s his problem?” Andrew sighed, exasperated. “Hey, you never mentioned you had a dog. Seems like an awful lot of work for you.” I commented. “Nah, he’s not mine, just some stray that’s been finding the yard lately for whatever reason.” The conversation petered off after that, but I remember thinking that if that was the case, it was odd that the dog had a collar.

I called it a night maybe two hours later, but I had a hard time sleeping because the dog continued to bark periodically until all hours of the morning. In the morning, Andrew was already gone to work when I awoke, but he’d left instructions on the kitchen counter for taking care of Chloe. I’d babysitted before as a teenager, so I could manage things fine, but it never really gets any more enjoyable changing a diaper. Other than that, there’s not much to say about the day other than that I’d tried checking out the door behind the bookshelf out of curiosity and boredom but I’d found it locked. I didn’t really care though, since it sounded like it was nothing more than just a small crawlspace or something.

When Andrew arrived home, wheeling Grandpa with him, I could see for myself just how sick he must have been. He had stage three skin cancer that had by now spread through a terrible amount of the tissue in his torso. Andrew would tell me later on that night that he had two weeks left, tops. The man looked like a skeleton, his complexion beyond wrinkled and pale, his head like a skull with its eyeballs left intact along with a few pointlessly added tufts of snow-white hair. His skin was hanging off of his body so, so loosely, as if the space between had been repeatedly filled with air and then deflated. I’d been hoping I could have at least some sort of conversation with him, since I’d seen him even less in my life than Andrew, but he could barely work a sentence together, mostly just murmuring, grunting and pointing at things to communicate.

The evening ended up being even more uncomfortable than the last, so I spent even more time with the company of my schoolwork, figuring Grandpa would probably prefer to be with his son anyway, especially seeing that as far as I knew, they hardly ever saw each other either. I ended up just going to bed early, Grandpa in the room next door, but of course I was kept up for ages by that stupid dog again.

I ended up spending, I think, another week at Andrew’s, and I’m not gonna recount every day from here on, since it ultimately doesn’t really matter much to where I am now. Andrew had to keep going to work, of course, so it fell to me to keep watch of Chloe, and help Grandpa take his medicine. The only words that he could consistently get out, or perhaps the only ones he cared to were his frequent complaints about the various pains in his body.

“The skin” “My muscles” “The flesh”

I’d heard before, not from my father but from my mother, about how Grandpa didn’t treat him and Andrew very well. He was Vietnam vet, and the war came home with him, rearing its head in the form of a bottle and the abuse that resulted from it. Even in spite of that, I couldn’t help but pity the pain he must have been experiencing for the last few months of his life. All I could do is keep encouraging him to choke down his pills.

During the second night with Grandpa in the house, I was woken up yet again by the incessant barking of the dog outside, After the dog had seemingly fucked off to annoy someone else, I was quickly drifting back to sleep, until I heard Grandpa mumbling something next door. I’d gotten accustomed to his mostly nonsensical mutterings throughout the day, and the house had thin walls, so I didn’t think too much of it, until I heard another voice, speaking back to him. Andrew’s voice, whispering, just audible.

*“No. I’ve told you already, it’s not happening, so get it out of your head.”*

*“You know you have to!”* came Grandpa’s slow response. His voice was like the creaking of an old floorboard, but he sounded far more lucid than I’d ever heard him before.

I don’t remember their conversation continuing beyond that point. I heard the door open softly, then shut again, and I didn’t have enough energy to ponder what I’d heard for long before I fell back asleep.

The next day, I decided to find out from Andrew about it in private.

“Hey, so, sorry if I’m being too nosy here, but I heard you and Grandpa talking about something last night. It sounded like you were arguing?” I asked. He sighed deeply. “Look, you… you’ve probably realised by now that this house is a lot older than you might’ve expected. Truth is it belonged to him – your father and I grew up here. He’s just, well, he’s not happy with how I’ve been running things here, that’s all. You know how older guys are really particular about that sorta thing.” He looked conflicted about what he’d said, and the silence between us was deafening. “Come on, I just managed to get Chloe asleep five minutes ago. Let’s get to bed for tonight.”

I can’t say I was entirely satisfied with that answer, but I could sense Andrew didn’t wish to discuss the matter any further, so I oblige him. On the bright side, there was no barking from the dog that night, or any of the following nights for that matter, so I slept well, at the very least.

I don’t have anything to say about the day after that, other than that the uncomfortable atmosphere in the house was only getting worse. Grandpa spent all of his time alone in his room, just sitting in his wheelchair in the corner, mumbling nonsense to himself – Andrew and I delivering his meals to him, giving him his pills, and sharing some unspoken weight about it all between us.

That night, I was woken up by another argument in Grandpa’s room. Grandpa’s voice was no louder, no more commanding, but I could sense an undeniable rage in it.

*“You’re a fool. You always were. I know what you did last night. You think that’s enough? It has to be me.”*

*“You don’t deserve it. You treated us like dirt!”*

*“IT DOESN’T MATTER IF I DESERVE IT. IT HAS TO BE ME, AND IT HAS TO BE TOMORROW.”*

I didn’t fall back to sleep quickly that time. Actually, I don’t think I got any sleep that night. I didn’t know what any of it meant, but grandpa’s words scared me.

The following day, Grandpa’s door was locked from the inside. Andrew also stayed home from work, and he looked terrible. I knew I had to ask him what happened last night, but I decided to give some space until the evening. I barely saw him all day, to be honest. The only perception I had of him was the tired cooing to Chloe every now and then, the unlocking and relocking of Grandpa’s door as he took his pills every three hours, and a dinner we shared in silence.

In the end, it was he who came to me.

“You heard us last night, didn’t you.”

I nodded.

“Yeah. I guess you deserve to know at least this much. I don’t imagine your parents ever told you before they were gone.” He looked like he was about to either scream or break down in tears. I’m not sure which.

“Your father and I had a younger sister once. Phoebe. I was eight when she was born, your old man eleven.”

My mind raced trying to fit this into my family history. He wasn’t lying, I’d never heard so much as a word of this throughout my life. “She went missing when she was five. Just gone, without a trace. They never found her. Dad started drinking a lot more after that.”

I didn’t know what to say. “That “tomorrow” Dad was talking about is the anniversary of the disappearance. I think the memories just hurt him the most today. They hurt me the worst today too.”

He was crying now. “I’m sorry,” I managed. “I don’t know what to say, I… I’m so sorry. No one ever told me.” Andrew rubbed his eyes, steeling himself. “Look, I’m sorry too. You should never have needed to know, really.” He started heading for the stairs. “I’m gonna try and get some sleep. Please, if you hear anything from him tonight, or if I have to come into him again, just ignore it. Please. It hurts everyone enough as it is.” With that, he headed up to his room, shutting the door behind him.

I was stunned. How much else had I not known about my dad’s side of the family? Even with what I did know now, I was left with more questions than before. It didn’t make sense how the truth about my Dad and Uncle also having a sister could link to everything else I’d overheard between Grandpa and Andrew. Why did it “have to be” Grandpa? What had Andrew done last night? What the hell even was “it”? My mind swam as I laid wide awake in bed that night. I think it was that state of fog in my brain that actually ended up putting me unconscious for a few hours, as it happened. But, one last time, I was awoken from my sleep, but it wasn’t by the barking of a dog, or by voices from Grandpa’s room next door. It was by slow, heavy footsteps, descending the stairs.

I know Andrew told me to ignore anything I might hear that night. To this day, I don’t know what compelled me to leave my room, but I crept out the door quietly, and the first thing I realised is that Grandpa’s door was open, and his room empty. The footsteps continued to pound through the house, into the kitchen, it seemed. I had to know. I had to know the truth to everything that was going on in this house, and I sensed that I was right at the cusp of it. As silently as I could, I too descended the stairs. I followed the noises to the kitchen, and I realised then what I’d been overlooking the whole time, the sight of it filling me with total dread.

The door behind the bookshelf, now wide open.

I abandoned whatever idea of stealth I had left in my head, rushing over to the door, where I found that it wasn’t some sort of small little cupboard or crawlspace at all, it was a flight of stairs, down to what must’ve been a cellar. Why had Andrew lied about this? I flew down the stairs and turned to the cellar door on my right, pressing my ear against it. Deep, heavy, fatigued breathing, and the surface of the door felt almost as if it was vibrating, pulsing with some impossible force. I gripped the door handle, and it felt white hot. My hand turns. The door opens. The truth is revealed.

Andrew was alone in the cellar, illuminated by one dim light bulb hanging from the ceiling, the kitchen knife in hand. No sign of Grandpa anywhere. Andrew barely reacted to my presence. He just kept staring at the wall opposite of him. Only, it wasn’t a wall. Not really.

Where there should have been brick and wallpaper, a pulsating, oozing, red-brown expanse of flesh spanned the side of the cellar ahead of us, the drywall at the edges of the adjacent walls transitioning from plaster and sheet brick into living tissue. The wall heaved, and throbbed, and sweat, somehow horrifically, impossibly given the gift of life. I can’t even begin to describe the smell. The smell was so fucking disgusting.

I could barely think. The sight of it almost made me feel mad, like I had found myself in a bizarre nightmare, any rational thoughts shackled away behind lock and key.

“What the fuck,” I choked. “What the fuck is this?”

“ANDREW! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? WHERE THE FUCK IS GRANDPA?”

He turned around, seemingly broken out of a trance. He stared back at the wall for a second. “He was right,” I heard him say, more to himself than to me. He turned back. “He was right. It had to be done.”

I glanced back around him to the putrid fleshy mass before my eyes. No. He couldn’t mean that.

“No. Andrew, where’s Grandpa? What have you done?” I begged, denying to myself what I knew had transpired.

Andrew glanced back at the wall again for few moments. He had a look of almost reverence etched across his face. He faced me for a second, madness twinkling in his eyes. “It’s what he wanted.”

“No! You’re lying!” I roared, not believing myself one bit. “WHAT THE FUCK EVEN IS THIS?”

He didn’t look away from the wall of flesh. “I inherited it, I suppose.

“It had to be done, you know. It’s what he wanted.”

The wall suddenly flexed outward grotesquely, emitting a low grumbling sound. Try as I did to deny it to myself in the moment, I knew what that must have meant, as I saw a look of concern flash across Andrew’s face. It was hungry again, needed to be fed soon. Clearly, Grandpa wasn’t a filling meal. Amidst the grumbling, we could both suddenly hear a high-pitched noise, piercing through it.

Chloe, crying from upstairs.

Andrew stared up at the ceiling, then back over to me.

“Don’t,” I whispered, but he was already charging towards the door. “Andrew, don’t!” He shoved hard against me as I tried to block him from getting out of the door. I threw myself against him with everything I had, tried to wrestle the knife from his grip, but he was far stronger than he looked, overpowering me quickly and slashing my right leg. I howled in shock and pain.

“You know what?” He hissed, throwing me to the ground and grabbing me by my legs as I gushed blood. “This is even better. You’re of far more use anyway.” I realised in an instant what he meant as he dragged me towards the wall of flesh.

“No,” I choked. “No Andrew please God I-” my words were cut off as I became almost entirely immersed in the writhing, living mass. Tendrils wrapped around me, almost painlessly puncturing through my skin, *connecting* to me. For a few brief, passing moments, I had the notion that I was linking, fusing to the grand, biological system of the wall, that soon all would be alive, all would be connected, before my mind went black.

After an unknowable length of time, I grew more and more aware of my surroundings once more, the bizarre, weightless sensation of simultaneously feeling out of my body and feeling one with another body. Then, something cold, foreign.

[“I’ve got you, I’ve got you!”]()

I fell forward into someone’s arms, the cold air of the cellar enveloping me in an instant as I screamed out. I looked up. I was surrounded by a team of men in yellow hazmat suits, working to fully cut me down from the wall of flesh. I laid in their arms, feeling the way I imagine a newborn infant must, my body and mind focusing entirely on trying not to seize up from how overwhelmingly cold everything seemed. A few minutes later, once I’d been fully freed from the wall, I was given sedatives that knocked me back out.

I don’t know how long I’d spent like that, but it must’ve been a few days at least, because it was my girlfriend, Emily, who had called the police after I hadn’t responded to a number of her calls. In the end, though, I was kept in some sort of containing facility for a day, where I was asked a great deal of dubious sounding questions that I couldn’t begin to answer for the most part. And they never ended up finding Andrew.

In the end, though, Emily took me back home, whatever classified part of the government that covers up shit like this did just that, and life mostly moved on. I tried my best to forget about that brief, hellish stint of my life. I certainly didn’t gain any sort of enlightenment or newfound appreciation for life by my experience. I was changed by it, I guess. Who wouldn’t be? But, as I said, life moved on. Emily was invaluable in ensuring that, comforting me about it when I needed her to but never acting like it defined me now.

Life moved on.

Four years later, I asked Emily to marry me. Five years later, she was my incredible wife. Eight years, and she gave birth to the joy of our lives, our daughter Lily. I loved my wife, of course I did, but there’s absolutely no feeling of adoration on this earth that compares to holding your own child in your arms.

And yes, of course I still felt scarred by my experience all those years ago. One night, as we were in bed getting ready to sleep, I told her about it once more. How even though things are fine now, things are *perfect* now, I still had nightmares about the wall of flesh sometimes. I still get sent into near panic attack at the sight of an open wound.

She held me in close.

“I know you do love, I know you do,” she murmured, her voice drowsy but full of care. “But you’ve got me, don’t you? You’ve got us.”

I closed my eyes and felt myself beginning to drift off as she held me closer still. I breathed in the beautiful smell of her rose-scented shampoo. “It’s okay, because I’ve got you.”

“I’ve got you,” she whispered.

*“I’ve got you.”*

“I’ve got you.”

“I’ve got you!”

“I’ve got you, I’ve got you!”

I fell forward into the man’s arms, the cold air of the cellar enveloping me in an instant as I screamed out. I looked up and all around, stared at the yellow-suited men, still screaming and babbling incoherently. I laid in their arms, still smelling the rose-scented shampoo, though there was now something horribly wrong with it, like how after you realise the trick of an optical illusion you can never see it as you originally did.

Pheromones.

\*\*\*

It turns out, the wall had been digesting me for quite some time indeed. I saw my reflection. I look emaciated, barely alive.

It showed me wonderful things. Now, I sit alone in my cold, dark apartment, looking outside at grey skies. I think of my wife’s smile. I think of my child’s laughter. I want to go back.",1,1741680318.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

I also start to feel overwhelmed with so much advice on the internet about how to learn French. I learn best with a structured approach so when people say you can just learn from watching TV, Movies etc it just isn't working for me as I don't understand anything!!

I would love to get your advice and any help you can offer so I don't give up on this for the 10th time!! I REALLY want to get better at French and be able to have normal conversations.

I had a mountain of college assignments to get cracking on, so I’d brought my laptop and sociology textbook in my travel bag. That’s how I spent the majority of the evening, taking an hour’s break for dinner.

We had another fairly awkward conversation about what I’d been getting up to in college (spoilers: fuck all.) From my seat at the dining room table, I was able to look out the window at a filth-coated golden retriever pottering around the yard outside. I hadn’t noticed it before; I was surprised that Andrew was able to manage a dog on top of his life as a single father. As I tried to focus on my pork chops, something else caught my eye. There was a door in the corner of the room that I hadn’t noticed before. A small door, almost entirely hidden behind another old bookshelf. I couldn’t see much of it, but there was something about the door that captured my attention, something in the way the wood seemed to shimmer in the dim light, as though it wasn’t quite real.

I called it a night maybe two hours later, but I had a hard time sleeping because the dog continued to bark periodically until all hours of the morning. In the morning, Andrew was already gone to work when I awoke, but he’d left instructions on the kitchen counter for taking care of Chloe. I’d babysitted before as a teenager, so I could manage things fine, but it never really gets any more enjoyable changing a diaper. Other than that, there’s not much to say about the day other than that I’d tried checking out the door behind the bookshelf out of curiosity and boredom but I’d found it locked. I didn’t really care though, since it sounded like it was nothing more than just a small crawlspace or something.

When Andrew arrived home, wheeling Grandpa with him, I could see for myself just how sick he must have been. He had stage three skin cancer that had by now spread through a terrible amount of the tissue in his torso. Andrew would tell me later on that night that he had two weeks left, tops. The man looked like a skeleton, his complexion beyond wrinkled and pale, his head like a skull with its eyeballs left intact along with a few pointlessly added tufts of snow-white hair. His skin was hanging off of his body so, so loosely, as if the space between had been repeatedly filled with air and then deflated. I’d been hoping I could have at least some sort of conversation with him, since I’d seen him even less in my life than Andrew, but he could barely work a sentence together, mostly just murmuring, grunting and pointing at things to communicate.

The evening ended up being even more uncomfortable than the last, so I spent even more time with the company of my schoolwork, figuring Grandpa would probably prefer to be with his son anyway, especially seeing that as far as I knew, they hardly ever saw each other either. I ended up just going to bed early, Grandpa in the room next door, but of course I was kept up for ages by that stupid dog again.

I ended up spending, I think, another week at Andrew’s, and I’m not gonna recount every day from here on, since it ultimately doesn’t really matter much to where I am now. Andrew had to keep going to work, of course, so it fell to me to keep watch of Chloe, and help Grandpa take his medicine. The only words that he could consistently get out, or perhaps the only ones he cared to were his frequent complaints about the various pains in his body.

“The skin” “My muscles” “The flesh”

I’d heard before, not from my father but from my mother, about how Grandpa didn’t treat him and Andrew very well. He was Vietnam vet, and the war came home with him, rearing its head in the form of a bottle and the abuse that resulted from it. Even in spite of that, I couldn’t help but pity the pain he must have been experiencing for the last few months of his life. All I could do is keep encouraging him to choke down his pills.

During the second night with Grandpa in the house, I was woken up yet again by the incessant barking of the dog outside, After the dog had seemingly fucked off to annoy someone else, I was quickly drifting back to sleep, until I heard Grandpa mumbling something next door. I’d gotten accustomed to his mostly nonsensical mutterings throughout the day, and the house had thin walls, so I didn’t think too much of it, until I heard another voice, speaking back to him. Andrew’s voice, whispering, just audible.

*“No. I’ve told you already, it’s not happening, so get it out of your head.”*

*“You know you have to!”* came Grandpa’s slow response. His voice was like the creaking of an old floorboard, but he sounded far more lucid than I’d ever heard him before.

I don’t remember their conversation continuing beyond that point. I heard the door open softly, then shut again, and I didn’t have enough energy to ponder what I’d heard for long before I fell back asleep.

The next day, I decided to find out from Andrew about it in private.

“Hey, so, sorry if I’m being too nosy here, but I heard you and Grandpa talking about something last night. It sounded like you were arguing?” I asked. He sighed deeply. “Look, you… you’ve probably realised by now that this house is a lot older than you might’ve expected. Truth is it belonged to him – your father and I grew up here. He’s just, well, he’s not happy with how I’ve been running things here, that’s all. You know how older guys are really particular about that sorta thing.” He looked conflicted about what he’d said, and the silence between us was deafening. “Come on, I just managed to get Chloe asleep five minutes ago. Let’s get to bed for tonight.”

I can’t say I was entirely satisfied with that answer, but I could sense Andrew didn’t wish to discuss the matter any further, so I oblige him. On the bright side, there was no barking from the dog that night, or any of the following nights for that matter, so I slept well, at the very least.

I don’t have anything to say about the day after that, other than that the uncomfortable atmosphere in the house was only getting worse. Grandpa spent all of his time alone in his room, just sitting in his wheelchair in the corner, mumbling nonsense to himself – Andrew and I delivering his meals to him, giving him his pills, and sharing some unspoken weight about it all between us.

That night, I was woken up by another argument in Grandpa’s room. Grandpa’s voice was no louder, no more commanding, but I could sense an undeniable rage in it.

*“You’re a fool. You always were. I know what you did last night. You think that’s enough? It has to be me.”*

*“You don’t deserve it. You treated us like dirt!”*

*“IT DOESN’T MATTER IF I DESERVE IT. IT HAS TO BE ME, AND IT HAS TO BE TOMORROW.”*

I didn’t fall back to sleep quickly that time. Actually, I don’t think I got any sleep that night. I didn’t know what any of it meant, but grandpa’s words scared me.

The following day, Grandpa’s door was locked from the inside. Andrew also stayed home from work, and he looked terrible. I knew I had to ask him what happened last night, but I decided to give some space until the evening. I barely saw him all day, to be honest. The only perception I had of him was the tired cooing to Chloe every now and then, the unlocking and relocking of Grandpa’s door as he took his pills every three hours, and a dinner we shared in silence.

In the end, it was he who came to me.

“You heard us last night, didn’t you.”

I nodded.

“Yeah. I guess you deserve to know at least this much. I don’t imagine your parents ever told you before they were gone.” He looked like he was about to either scream or break down in tears. I’m not sure which.

“Your father and I had a younger sister once. Phoebe. I was eight when she was born, your old man eleven.”

My mind raced trying to fit this into my family history. He wasn’t lying, I’d never heard so much as a word of this throughout my life. “She went missing when she was five. Just gone, without a trace. They never found her. Dad started drinking a lot more after that.”

I didn’t know what to say. “That “tomorrow” Dad was talking about is the anniversary of the disappearance. I think the memories just hurt him the most today. They hurt me the worst today too.”

He was crying now. “I’m sorry,” I managed. “I don’t know what to say, I… I’m so sorry. No one ever told me.” Andrew rubbed his eyes, steeling himself. “Look, I’m sorry too. You should never have needed to know, really.” He started heading for the stairs. “I’m gonna try and get some sleep. Please, if you hear anything from him tonight, or if I have to come into him again, just ignore it. Please. It hurts everyone enough as it is.” With that, he headed up to his room, shutting the door behind him.

I was stunned. How much else had I not known about my dad’s side of the family? Even with what I did know now, I was left with more questions than before. It didn’t make sense how the truth about my Dad and Uncle also having a sister could link to everything else I’d overheard between Grandpa and Andrew. Why did it “have to be” Grandpa? What had Andrew done last night? What the hell even was “it”? My mind swam as I laid wide awake in bed that night. I think it was that state of fog in my brain that actually ended up putting me unconscious for a few hours, as it happened. But, one last time, I was awoken from my sleep, but it wasn’t by the barking of a dog, or by voices from Grandpa’s room next door. It was by slow, heavy footsteps, descending the stairs.

I know Andrew told me to ignore anything I might hear that night. To this day, I don’t know what compelled me to leave my room, but I crept out the door quietly, and the first thing I realised is that Grandpa’s door was open, and his room empty. The footsteps continued to pound through the house, into the kitchen, it seemed. I had to know. I had to know the truth to everything that was going on in this house, and I sensed that I was right at the cusp of it. As silently as I could, I too descended the stairs. I followed the noises to the kitchen, and I realised then what I’d been overlooking the whole time, the sight of it filling me with total dread.

The door behind the bookshelf, now wide open.

I abandoned whatever idea of stealth I had left in my head, rushing over to the door, where I found that it wasn’t some sort of small little cupboard or crawlspace at all, it was a flight of stairs, down to what must’ve been a cellar. Why had Andrew lied about this? I flew down the stairs and turned to the cellar door on my right, pressing my ear against it. Deep, heavy, fatigued breathing, and the surface of the door felt almost as if it was vibrating, pulsing with some impossible force. I gripped the door handle, and it felt white hot. My hand turns. The door opens. The truth is revealed.

Andrew was alone in the cellar, illuminated by one dim light bulb hanging from the ceiling, the kitchen knife in hand. No sign of Grandpa anywhere. Andrew barely reacted to my presence. He just kept staring at the wall opposite of him. Only, it wasn’t a wall. Not really.

Where there should have been brick and wallpaper, a pulsating, oozing, red-brown expanse of flesh spanned the side of the cellar ahead of us, the drywall at the edges of the adjacent walls transitioning from plaster and sheet brick into living tissue. The wall heaved, and throbbed, and sweat, somehow horrifically, impossibly given the gift of life. I can’t even begin to describe the smell. The smell was so fucking disgusting.

I could barely think. The sight of it almost made me feel mad, like I had found myself in a bizarre nightmare, any rational thoughts shackled away behind lock and key.

“What the fuck,” I choked. “What the fuck is this?”

“ANDREW! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? WHERE THE FUCK IS GRANDPA?”

He turned around, seemingly broken out of a trance. He stared back at the wall for a second. “He was right,” I heard him say, more to himself than to me. He turned back. “He was right. It had to be done.”

I glanced back around him to the putrid fleshy mass before my eyes. No. He couldn’t mean that.

“No. Andrew, where’s Grandpa? What have you done?” I begged, denying to myself what I knew had transpired.

Andrew glanced back at the wall again for few moments. He had a look of almost reverence etched across his face. He faced me for a second, madness twinkling in his eyes. “It’s what he wanted.”

“No! You’re lying!” I roared, not believing myself one bit. “WHAT THE FUCK EVEN IS THIS?”

He didn’t look away from the wall of flesh. “I inherited it, I suppose.

“It had to be done, you know. It’s what he wanted.”

The wall suddenly flexed outward grotesquely, emitting a low grumbling sound. Try as I did to deny it to myself in the moment, I knew what that must have meant, as I saw a look of concern flash across Andrew’s face. It was hungry again, needed to be fed soon. Clearly, Grandpa wasn’t a filling meal. Amidst the grumbling, we could both suddenly hear a high-pitched noise, piercing through it.

Chloe, crying from upstairs.

Andrew stared up at the ceiling, then back over to me.

“Don’t,” I whispered, but he was already charging towards the door. “Andrew, don’t!” He shoved hard against me as I tried to block him from getting out of the door. I threw myself against him with everything I had, tried to wrestle the knife from his grip, but he was far stronger than he looked, overpowering me quickly and slashing my right leg. I howled in shock and pain.

“You know what?” He hissed, throwing me to the ground and grabbing me by my legs as I gushed blood. “This is even better. You’re of far more use anyway.” I realised in an instant what he meant as he dragged me towards the wall of flesh.

“No,” I choked. “No Andrew please God I-” my words were cut off as I became almost entirely immersed in the writhing, living mass. Tendrils wrapped around me, almost painlessly puncturing through my skin, *connecting* to me. For a few brief, passing moments, I had the notion that I was linking, fusing to the grand, biological system of the wall, that soon all would be alive, all would be connected, before my mind went black.

After an unknowable length of time, I grew more and more aware of my surroundings once more, the bizarre, weightless sensation of simultaneously feeling out of my body and feeling one with another body. Then, something cold, foreign.

[“I’ve got you, I’ve got you!”]()

I fell forward into someone’s arms, the cold air of the cellar enveloping me in an instant as I screamed out. I looked up. I was surrounded by a team of men in yellow hazmat suits, working to fully cut me down from the wall of flesh. I laid in their arms, feeling the way I imagine a newborn infant must, my body and mind focusing entirely on trying not to seize up from how overwhelmingly cold everything seemed. A few minutes later, once I’d been fully freed from the wall, I was given sedatives that knocked me back out.

I don’t know how long I’d spent like that, but it must’ve been a few days at least, because it was my girlfriend, Emily, who had called the police after I hadn’t responded to a number of her calls. In the end, though, I was kept in some sort of containing facility for a day, where I was asked a great deal of dubious sounding questions that I couldn’t begin to answer for the most part. And they never ended up finding Andrew.

In the end, though, Emily took me back home, whatever classified part of the government that covers up shit like this did just that, and life mostly moved on. I tried my best to forget about that brief, hellish stint of my life. I certainly didn’t gain any sort of enlightenment or newfound appreciation for life by my experience. I was changed by it, I guess. Who wouldn’t be? But, as I said, life moved on. Emily was invaluable in ensuring that, comforting me about it when I needed her to but never acting like it defined me now.

Life moved on.

Four years later, I asked Emily to marry me. Five years later, she was my incredible wife. Eight years, and she gave birth to the joy of our lives, our daughter Lily. I loved my wife, of course I did, but there’s absolutely no feeling of adoration on this earth that compares to holding your own child in your arms.

And yes, of course I still felt scarred by my experience all those years ago. One night, as we were in bed getting ready to sleep, I told her about it once more. How even though things are fine now, things are *perfect* now, I still had nightmares about the wall of flesh sometimes. I still get sent into near panic attack at the sight of an open wound.

She held me in close.

“I know you do love, I know you do,” she murmured, her voice drowsy but full of care. “But you’ve got me, don’t you? You’ve got us.”

I closed my eyes and felt myself beginning to drift off as she held me closer still. I breathed in the beautiful smell of her rose-scented shampoo. “It’s okay, because I’ve got you.”

“I’ve got you,” she whispered.

*“I’ve got you.”*

“I’ve got you.”

“I’ve got you!”

“I’ve got you, I’ve got you!”

I fell forward into the man’s arms, the cold air of the cellar enveloping me in an instant as I screamed out. I looked up and all around, stared at the yellow-suited men, still screaming and babbling incoherently. I laid in their arms, still smelling the rose-scented shampoo, though there was now something horribly wrong with it, like how after you realise the trick of an optical illusion you can never see it as you originally did.

Pheromones.

\*\*\*

It turns out, the wall had been digesting me for quite some time indeed. I saw my reflection. I look emaciated, barely alive.

It showed me wonderful things. Now, I sit alone in my cold, dark apartment, looking outside at grey skies. I think of my wife’s smile. I think of my child’s laughter. I want to go back.",1,1741680049.0,sleepeater,0,1.0,False
1j8lp3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1j8lp3f/grandpas_secret_lived_in_the_basement/,Grandpa’s secret lived in the basement,"It was during the spring break of my second year at college that I got a phone call from my uncle Andrew, asking me if I’d be willing to spend a few days over at his house. My grandfather had been sick for a long, tough while, and it’d apparently gotten to the stage that the primary focus now was less so to treat him and more so to just make him as comfortable as possible for the time he had left.

I can’t say I envied anyone in the situation – Grandpa, who’d be getting ready to face eternity in a house that wasn’t his, with no company but a son who he barely spoke to these days, and Andrew, who’s girlfriend died giving birth to their daughter seven months ago and was now tasked with taking care of a dying man on top of that. I’d like to act as if I was making a saintly decision to come over and offer a helping hand out of love for my family, but the truth was that it had been quite some time since I’d spoken to Andrew last, and it had been… forever since I’d spoken to my paternal grandfather. No, I went because I was lonely, unbearably so. I didn’t have any friends to speak of at college, and ever since my mother passed away about a year ago, I’d had no one to talk to at all. I made the decision to help Andrew out of the desperation for proper social interaction. Not like there’d be much to it, anyway. All I really imagined I’d be doing is keeping the baby out of his hair when he was too busy and getting grandpa anything he needed.

Andrew’s house was out in the sticks, at least forty minutes away from the nearest town. My family are mostly dotted around a generally quite rural county, so there wasn’t much in the area but barren roads and the odd building or two. As for the house itself, there wasn’t really much to say about it from the front yard. Just another isolated double story that someone called home. I rang the doorbell, and after a few moments Andrew greeted me. He seemed more or less the same as the last time I’d seen him in the flesh.

“Ah, Nick, how’re you doing? Thanks so much again for coming”, he smiled, his voice nothing if not welcoming. “Nah, not like I had much going on anyway,” I replied, to which he chuckled. “Come on in, throw you jacket on the hanger there. You want some coffee?”

“Sure,” I said.

“Yeah, alright. Have a seat over in the living room. First door to your left.

I took his invitation and made my way over. Now that I was fully inside, I could see that there was more to Andrews’s house than meets the eye at first. It smelled like old books and something faintly musty, the scent of time that slowly claimed everything. The entryway was wide and dimly lit, with heavy curtains blocking out the daylight. There was a quiet rhythm to the house—the creaking of wood beneath our feet, the soft shuffle of Andrew’s footsteps echoing through long corridors. It had the basic interior of a house a lot older than you’d think it was from outside, with aged patterns across the wallpaper and a somewhat ornate type of miniature chandelier suspended from the ceiling. Clashing with these design decisions was the more minimalist furniture and art pieces hanging from the walls. It seemed like someone had taken these measures in order to give the inside of the building a more modern feel, but really, it was a bandaid on a bullethole.

I looked around after reaching my destination. The living room appeared comfortable enough, with an ever so slightly peeling couch, a worn rug, and shelves of books that didn’t seem to have been touched in years. It was the kind of place that felt frozen in time. A bit musty, but lived-in, as though the walls had absorbed the memories of countless years of family life.

A minute or so later, Andrew entered with two mugs. I sipped mine slowly as we exchanged some admittedly uncomfortable small talk. “God, you look so grown up. It’s been, what, two years?” It’d been at least five. This continued for a while until we got to the tasks that’d be at hand for the next number of days.

“I’ll be picking him up from the hospice tomorrow after work. It’ll probably be close to seven before we’ll be back. Chloe’s upstairs having her nap right now, so I’m gonna go and get started on making dinner. In the meantime, you go ahead and make yourself comfortable. There are two rooms free upstairs, you can take your pick.” He rose and clapped me on the shoulders before heading over to the kitchen. “I really do appreciate it, Nick. It’s been rough having to pay for babysitters.”

After going upstairs, I passed what must’ve been Andrew’s room on the way down the hallway, another chamber masquerading as belonging to a home far younger than was the reality, with a double bed and a child’s cot next to it, the baby sleeping soundly inside. I had a mountain of college assignments to get cracking on, so I’d brought my laptop and sociology textbook in my travel bag. That’s how I spent the majority of the evening, taking an hour’s break for dinner.

We had another fairly awkward conversation about what I’d been getting up to in college (spoilers: fuck all.) From my seat at the dining room table, I was able to look out the window at a filth-coated golden retriever pottering around the yard outside. I hadn’t noticed it before; I was surprised that Andrew was able to manage a dog on top of his life as a single father. As I tried to focus on my pork chops, something else caught my eye. There was a door in the corner of the room that I hadn’t noticed before. A small door, almost entirely hidden behind another old bookshelf. I couldn’t see much of it, but there was something about the door that captured my attention, something in the way the wood seemed to shimmer in the dim light, as though it wasn’t quite real.

“Is that a closet?” I asked, pointing.

Andrew looked over his shoulder and then shook her head quickly. “Oh, that? No, just a small little space in the structure I haven’t really found a use for yet.” He smiled, but it was tight, forced. I was going to ask him more before the dog outside started barking loudly. “God, what’s his problem?” Andrew sighed, exasperated. “Hey, you never mentioned you had a dog. Seems like an awful lot of work for you.” I commented. “Nah, he’s not mine, just some stray that’s been finding the yard lately for whatever reason.” The conversation petered off after that, but I remember thinking that if that was the case, it was odd that the dog had a collar.

I called it a night maybe two hours later, but I had a hard time sleeping because the dog continued to bark periodically until all hours of the morning. In the morning, Andrew was already gone to work when I awoke, but he’d left instructions on the kitchen counter for taking care of Chloe.

I didn’t really care though, since it sounded like it was nothing more than just a small crawlspace or something.

When Andrew arrived home, wheeling Grandpa with him, I could see for myself just how sick he must have been. He had stage three skin cancer that had by now spread through a terrible amount of the tissue in his torso. Andrew would tell me later on that night that he had two weeks left, tops. The man looked like a skeleton, his complexion beyond wrinkled and pale, his head like a skull with its eyeballs left intact along with a few pointlessly added tufts of snow-white hair.

The door behind the bookshelf, now wide open.

I abandoned whatever idea of stealth I had left in my head, rushing over to the door, where I found that it wasn’t some sort of small little cupboard or crawlspace at all, it was a flight of stairs, down to what must’ve been a cellar. Why had Andrew lied about this? I flew down the stairs and turned to the cellar door on my right, pressing my ear against it. Deep, heavy, fatigued breathing, and the surface of the door felt almost as if it was vibrating, pulsing with some impossible force. I gripped the door handle, and it felt white hot. My hand turns. The door opens. The truth is revealed.

Andrew was alone in the cellar, illuminated by one dim light bulb hanging from the ceiling, the kitchen knife in hand. No sign of Grandpa anywhere. Andrew barely reacted to my presence. He just kept staring at the wall opposite of him. Only, it wasn’t a wall. Not really.

Where there should have been brick and wallpaper, a pulsating, oozing, red-brown expanse of flesh spanned the side of the cellar ahead of us, the drywall at the edges of the adjacent walls transitioning from plaster and sheet brick into living tissue. The wall heaved, and throbbed, and sweat, somehow horrifically, impossibly given the gift of life. I can’t even begin to describe the smell. The smell was so fucking disgusting.

I could barely think. The sight of it almost made me feel mad, like I had found myself in a bizarre nightmare, any rational thoughts shackled away behind lock and key.

“What the fuck,” I choked. “What the fuck is this?”

“ANDREW! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? WHERE THE FUCK IS GRANDPA?”

He turned around, seemingly broken out of a trance. He stared back at the wall for a second. “He was right,” I heard him say, more to himself than to me. He turned back. “He was right. It had to be done.”

I glanced back around him to the putrid fleshy mass before my eyes. No. He couldn’t mean that.

“No. Andrew, where’s Grandpa? What have you done?” I begged, denying to myself what I knew had transpired.

Andrew glanced back at the wall again for few moments. He had a look of almost reverence etched across his face. He faced me for a second, madness twinkling in his eyes. “It’s what he wanted.”

“No! You’re lying!” I roared, not believing myself one bit. “WHAT THE FUCK EVEN IS THIS?”

He didn’t look away from the wall of flesh. “I inherited it, I suppose.

“It had to be done, you know. It’s what he wanted.”

The wall suddenly flexed outward grotesquely, emitting a low grumbling sound. Try as I did to deny it to myself in the moment, I knew what that must have meant, as I saw a look of concern flash across Andrew’s face. It was hungry again, needed to be fed soon. Clearly, Grandpa wasn’t a filling meal. Amidst the grumbling, we could both suddenly hear a high-pitched noise, piercing through it.

Chloe, crying from upstairs.

Andrew stared up at the ceiling, then back over to me.

“Don’t,” I whispered, but he was already charging towards the door. “Andrew, don’t!” He shoved hard against me as I tried to block him from getting out of the door. I threw myself against him with everything I had, tried to wrestle the knife from his grip, but he was far stronger than he looked, overpowering me quickly and slashing my right leg. I howled in shock and pain.

“You know what?” He hissed, throwing me to the ground and grabbing me by my legs as I gushed blood. “This is even better. You’re of far more use anyway.” I realised in an instant what he meant as he dragged me towards the wall of flesh.

“No,” I choked. “No Andrew please God I-” my words were cut off as I became almost entirely immersed in the writhing, living mass. Tendrils wrapped around me, almost painlessly puncturing through my skin, *connecting* to me. For a few brief, passing moments, I had the notion that I was linking, fusing to the grand, biological system of the wall, that soon all would be alive, all would be connected, before my mind went black.

After an unknowable length of time, I grew more and more aware of my surroundings once more, the bizarre, weightless sensation of simultaneously feeling out of my body and feeling one with another body. Then, something cold, foreign.

[“I’ve got you, I’ve got you!”]()

I fell forward into someone’s arms, the cold air of the cellar enveloping me in an instant as I screamed out. I looked up. I was surrounded by a team of men in yellow hazmat suits, working to fully cut me down from the wall of flesh. I laid in their arms, feeling the way I imagine a newborn infant must, my body and mind focusing entirely on trying not to seize up from how overwhelmingly cold everything seemed. A few minutes later, once I’d been fully freed from the wall, I was given sedatives that knocked me back out.

I don’t know how long I’d spent like that, but it must’ve been a few days at least, because it was my girlfriend, Emily, who had called the police after I hadn’t responded to a number of her calls. In the end, though, I was kept in some sort of containing facility for a day, where I was asked a great deal of dubious sounding questions that I couldn’t begin to answer for the most part. And they never ended up finding Andrew.

In the end, though, Emily took me back home, whatever classified part of the government that covers up shit like this did just that, and life mostly moved on. I tried my best to forget about that brief, hellish stint of my life. I certainly didn’t gain any sort of enlightenment or newfound appreciation for life by my experience. I was changed by it, I guess. Who wouldn’t be? But, as I said, life moved on. Emily was invaluable in ensuring that, comforting me about it when I needed her to but never acting like it defined me now.

Life moved on.

Four years later, I asked Emily to marry me. Five years later, she was my incredible wife. Eight years, and she gave birth to the joy of our lives, our daughter Lily. I loved my wife, of course I did, but there’s absolutely no feeling of adoration on this earth that compares to holding your own child in your arms.

And yes, of course I still felt scarred by my experience all those years ago. One night, as we were in bed getting ready to sleep, I told her about it once more. How even though things are fine now, things are *perfect* now, I still had nightmares about the wall of flesh sometimes. I still get sent into near panic attack at the sight of an open wound.

She held me in close.

“I know you do love, I know you do,” she murmured, her voice drowsy but full of care. “But you’ve got me, don’t you? You’ve got us.”

I closed my eyes and felt myself beginning to drift off as she held me closer still. I breathed in the beautiful smell of her rose-scented shampoo. “It’s okay, because I’ve got you.”

“I’ve got you,” she whispered.

*“I’ve got you.”*

“I’ve got you.”

“I’ve got you!”

“I’ve got you, I’ve got you!”

I fell forward into the man’s arms, the cold air of the cellar enveloping me in an instant as I screamed out. I looked up and all around, stared at the yellow-suited men, still screaming and babbling incoherently. I laid in their arms, still smelling the rose-scented shampoo, though there was now something horribly wrong with it, like how after you realise the trick of an optical illusion you can never see it as you originally did.

Pheromones.

It turns out, the wall had been digesting me for quite some time indeed. I saw my reflection. I look emaciated, barely alive.

1j8lkum,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j8lkum/grandpas_secret_lived_in_the_basement/,Grandpa's secret lived in the basement,"It was during the spring break of my second year at college that I got a phone call from my uncle Andrew, asking me if I’d be willing to spend a few days over at his house. My grandfather had been sick for a long, tough while, and it’d apparently gotten to the stage that the primary focus now was less so to treat him and more so to just make him as comfortable as possible for the time he had left.

I can’t say I envied anyone in the situation – Grandpa, who’d be getting ready to face eternity in a house that wasn’t his, with no company but a son who he barely spoke to these days, and Andrew, who’s girlfriend died giving birth to their daughter seven months ago and was now tasked with taking care of a dying man on top of that. I’d like to act as if I was making a saintly decision to come over and offer a helping hand out of love for my family, but the truth was that it had been quite some time since I’d spoken to Andrew last, and it had been… forever since I’d spoken to my paternal grandfather. No, I went because I was lonely, unbearably so. I didn’t have any friends to speak of at college, and ever since my mother passed away about a year ago, I’d had no one to talk to at all. I made the decision to help Andrew out of the desperation for proper social interaction. Not like there’d be much to it, anyway. All I really imagined I’d be doing is keeping the baby out of his hair when he was too busy and getting grandpa anything he needed.

Andrew’s house was out in the sticks, at least forty minutes away from the nearest town. My family are mostly dotted around a generally quite rural county, so there wasn’t much in the area but barren roads and the odd building or two. As for the house itself, there wasn’t really much to say about it from the front yard. Just another isolated double story that someone called home. I rang the doorbell, and after a few moments Andrew greeted me. He seemed more or less the same as the last time I’d seen him in the flesh.

“Ah, Nick, how’re you doing? Thanks so much again for coming”, he smiled, his voice nothing if not welcoming. “Nah, not like I had much going on anyway,” I replied, to which he chuckled. “Come on in, throw you jacket on the hanger there. You want some coffee?”

“Sure,” I said.

“Yeah, alright. Have a seat over in the living room. First door to your left.

I took his invitation and made my way over. Now that I was fully inside, I could see that there was more to Andrews’s house than meets the eye at first. It smelled like old books and something faintly musty, the scent of time that slowly claimed everything. The entryway was wide and dimly lit, with heavy curtains blocking out the daylight. There was a quiet rhythm to the house—the creaking of wood beneath our feet, the soft shuffle of Andrew’s footsteps echoing through long corridors. It had the basic interior of a house a lot older than you’d think it was from outside, with aged patterns across the wallpaper and a somewhat ornate type of miniature chandelier suspended from the ceiling. Clashing with these design decisions was the more minimalist furniture and art pieces hanging from the walls. It seemed like someone had taken these measures in order to give the inside of the building a more modern feel, but really, it was a bandaid on a bullethole.

I looked around after reaching my destination. The living room appeared comfortable enough, with an ever so slightly peeling couch, a worn rug, and shelves of books that didn’t seem to have been touched in years. It was the kind of place that felt frozen in time. A bit musty, but lived-in, as though the walls had absorbed the memories of countless years of family life.

A minute or so later, Andrew entered with two mugs. I sipped mine slowly as we exchanged some admittedly uncomfortable small talk. “God, you look so grown up. It’s been, what, two years?” It’d been at least five. This continued for a while until we got to the tasks that’d be at hand for the next number of days.

“I’ll be picking him up from the hospice tomorrow after work. It’ll probably be close to seven before we’ll be back. Chloe’s upstairs having her nap right now, so I’m gonna go and get started on making dinner. In the meantime, you go ahead and make yourself comfortable. There are two rooms free upstairs, you can take your pick.” He rose and clapped me on the shoulders before heading over to the kitchen. “I really do appreciate it, Nick. It’s been rough having to pay for babysitters.”

After going upstairs, I passed what must’ve been Andrew’s room on the way down the hallway, another chamber masquerading as belonging to a home far younger than was the reality, with a double bed and a child’s cot next to it, the baby sleeping soundly inside. I had a mountain of college assignments to get cracking on, so I’d brought my laptop and sociology textbook in my travel bag. That’s how I spent the majority of the evening, taking an hour’s break for dinner.

We had another fairly awkward conversation about what I’d been getting up to in college (spoilers: fuck all.) From my seat at the dining room table, I was able to look out the window at a filth-coated golden retriever pottering around the yard outside. I hadn’t noticed it before; I was surprised that Andrew was able to manage a dog on top of his life as a single father. As I tried to focus on my pork chops, something else caught my eye. There was a door in the corner of the room that I hadn’t noticed before. A small door, almost entirely hidden behind another old bookshelf. I couldn’t see much of it, but there was something about the door that captured my attention, something in the way the wood seemed to shimmer in the dim light, as though it wasn’t quite real.

“Is that a closet?” I asked, pointing.

Andrew looked over his shoulder and then shook her head quickly. “Oh, that? No, just a small little space in the structure I haven’t really found a use for yet.” He smiled, but it was tight, forced. I was going to ask him more before the dog outside started barking loudly. “God, what’s his problem?” Andrew sighed, exasperated. “Hey, you never mentioned you had a dog. Seems like an awful lot of work for you.” I commented. “Nah, he’s not mine, just some stray that’s been finding the yard lately for whatever reason.” The conversation petered off after that, but I remember thinking that if that was the case, it was odd that the dog had a collar.

I called it a night maybe two hours later, but I had a hard time sleeping because the dog continued to bark periodically until all hours of the morning. In the morning, Andrew was already gone to work when I awoke, but he’d left instructions on the kitchen counter for taking care of Chloe. I’d babysitted before as a teenager, so I could manage things fine, but it never really gets any more enjoyable changing a diaper. Other than that, there’s not much to say about the day other than that I’d tried checking out the door behind the bookshelf out of curiosity and boredom but I’d found it locked. I didn’t really care though, since it sounded like it was nothing more than just a small crawlspace or something.

When Andrew arrived home, wheeling Grandpa with him, I could see for myself just how sick he must have been. He had stage three skin cancer that had by now spread through a terrible amount of the tissue in his torso. Andrew would tell me later on that night that he had two weeks left, tops. The man looked like a skeleton, his complexion beyond wrinkled and pale, his head like a skull with its eyeballs left intact along with a few pointlessly added tufts of snow-white hair. His skin was hanging off of his body so, so loosely, as if the space between had been repeatedly filled with air and then deflated. I’d been hoping I could have at least some sort of conversation with him, since I’d seen him even less in my life than Andrew, but he could barely work a sentence together, mostly just murmuring, grunting and pointing at things to communicate.

The evening ended up being even more uncomfortable than the last, so I spent even more time with the company of my schoolwork, figuring Grandpa would probably prefer to be with his son anyway, especially seeing that as far as I knew, they hardly ever saw each other either. I ended up just going to bed early, Grandpa in the room next door, but of course I was kept up for ages by that stupid dog again.

I ended up spending, I think, another week at Andrew’s, and I’m not gonna recount every day from here on, since it ultimately doesn’t really matter much to where I am now. Andrew had to keep going to work, of course, so it fell to me to keep watch of Chloe, and help Grandpa take his medicine. The only words that he could consistently get out, or perhaps the only ones he cared to were his frequent complaints about the various pains in his body.

“The skin” “My muscles” “The flesh”

I’d heard before, not from my father but from my mother, about how Grandpa didn’t treat him and Andrew very well. He was Vietnam vet, and the war came home with him, rearing its head in the form of a bottle and the abuse that resulted from it. Even in spite of that, I couldn’t help but pity the pain he must have been experiencing for the last few months of his life. All I could do is keep encouraging him to choke down his pills.

During the second night with Grandpa in the house, I was woken up yet again by the incessant barking of the dog outside, After the dog had seemingly fucked off to annoy someone else, I was quickly drifting back to sleep, until I heard Grandpa mumbling something next door. I’d gotten accustomed to his mostly nonsensical mutterings throughout the day, and the house had thin walls, so I didn’t think too much of it, until I heard another voice, speaking back to him. Andrew’s voice, whispering, just audible.

*“No. I’ve told you already, it’s not happening, so get it out of your head.”*

*“You know you have to!”* came Grandpa’s slow response. His voice was like the creaking of an old floorboard, but he sounded far more lucid than I’d ever heard him before.

I don’t remember their conversation continuing beyond that point. I heard the door open softly, then shut again, and I didn’t have enough energy to ponder what I’d heard for long before I fell back asleep.

The next day, I decided to find out from Andrew about it in private.

“Hey, so, sorry if I’m being too nosy here, but I heard you and Grandpa talking about something last night. It sounded like you were arguing?” I asked. He sighed deeply. “Look, you… you’ve probably realised by now that this house is a lot older than you might’ve expected. Truth is it belonged to him – your father and I grew up here. He’s just, well, he’s not happy with how I’ve been running things here, that’s all. You know how older guys are really particular about that sorta thing.” He looked conflicted about what he’d said, and the silence between us was deafening. “Come on, I just managed to get Chloe asleep five minutes ago. Let’s get to bed for tonight.”

I can’t say I was entirely satisfied with that answer, but I could sense Andrew didn’t wish to discuss the matter any further, so I oblige him. On the bright side, there was no barking from the dog that night, or any of the following nights for that matter, so I slept well, at the very least.

I don’t have anything to say about the day after that, other than that the uncomfortable atmosphere in the house was only getting worse. Grandpa spent all of his time alone in his room, just sitting in his wheelchair in the corner, mumbling nonsense to himself – Andrew and I delivering his meals to him, giving him his pills, and sharing some unspoken weight about it all between us.

That night, I was woken up by another argument in Grandpa’s room. Grandpa’s voice was no louder, no more commanding, but I could sense an undeniable rage in it.

*“You’re a fool. You always were. I know what you did last night. You think that’s enough? It has to be me.”*

*“You don’t deserve it. You treated us like dirt!”*

*“IT DOESN’T MATTER IF I DESERVE IT. IT HAS TO BE ME, AND IT HAS TO BE TOMORROW.”*

I didn’t fall back to sleep quickly that time. Actually, I don’t think I got any sleep that night. I didn’t know what any of it meant, but grandpa’s words scared me.

The following day, Grandpa’s door was locked from the inside. Andrew also stayed home from work, and he looked terrible. I knew I had to ask him what happened last night, but I decided to give some space until the evening. I barely saw him all day, to be honest. The only perception I had of him was the tired cooing to Chloe every now and then, the unlocking and relocking of Grandpa’s door as he took his pills every three hours, and a dinner we shared in silence.

In the end, it was he who came to me.

“You heard us last night, didn’t you.”

I nodded.

“Yeah. I guess you deserve to know at least this much. I don’t imagine your parents ever told you before they were gone.” He looked like he was about to either scream or break down in tears. I’m not sure which.

“Your father and I had a younger sister once. Phoebe. I was eight when she was born, your old man eleven.”

My mind raced trying to fit this into my family history. He wasn’t lying, I’d never heard so much as a word of this throughout my life. “She went missing when she was five. Just gone, without a trace. They never found her. Dad started drinking a lot more after that.”

I didn’t know what to say. “That “tomorrow” Dad was talking about is the anniversary of the disappearance. I think the memories just hurt him the most today. They hurt me the worst today too.”

He was crying now. “I’m sorry,” I managed. “I don’t know what to say, I… I’m so sorry. No one ever told me.” Andrew rubbed his eyes, steeling himself. “Look, I’m sorry too. You should never have needed to know, really.” He started heading for the stairs. “I’m gonna try and get some sleep. Please, if you hear anything from him tonight, or if I have to come into him again, just ignore it. Please. It hurts everyone enough as it is.” With that, he headed up to his room, shutting the door behind him.

I was stunned. How much else had I not known about my dad’s side of the family? Even with what I did know now, I was left with more questions than before. It didn’t make sense how the truth about my Dad and Uncle also having a sister could link to everything else I’d overheard between Grandpa and Andrew. Why did it “have to be” Grandpa? What had Andrew done last night? What the hell even was “it”? My mind swam as I laid wide awake in bed that night. I think it was that state of fog in my brain that actually ended up putting me unconscious for a few hours, as it happened. But, one last time, I was awoken from my sleep, but it wasn’t by the barking of a dog, or by voices from Grandpa’s room next door. It was by slow, heavy footsteps, descending the stairs.

I know Andrew told me to ignore anything I might hear that night. To this day, I don’t know what compelled me to leave my room, but I crept out the door quietly, and the first thing I realised is that Grandpa’s door was open, and his room empty. The footsteps continued to pound through the house, into the kitchen, it seemed. I had to know. I had to know the truth to everything that was going on in this house, and I sensed that I was right at the cusp of it. As silently as I could, I too descended the stairs. I followed the noises to the kitchen, and I realised then what I’d been overlooking the whole time, the sight of it filling me with total dread.

The wall heaved, and throbbed, and sweat, somehow horrifically, impossibly given the gift of life. I can’t even begin to describe the smell. The smell was so fucking disgusting.

I could barely think. The sight of it almost made me feel mad, like I had found myself in a bizarre nightmare, any rational thoughts shackled away behind lock and key.

1j8lggd,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1j8lggd/can_i_get_some_feedback/,Can I get some feedback?,"Hey Guys,

So this is my only complete chapter so far. Just and FYI, it might be unsettling for some who are sensitive. I have an idea of where I am going in this book. I am starting chapter 2. Let know what you guys think. Obviously, I'm not going for New York Times best seller. But I'd like to make a decent book once.

With the click of the deadbolt, my day officially ended. The sharp inhale of arctic-chilled air filled my lungs. Every person in the city was gathering supplies before the great Samhain celebration. Shops like mine emptied out of much needed supplies for the rituals that would be performed during the thinning of the veils. Most purchased anise stars, bay leaf, cedarwood, eucalyptus, and iron. Yet protection is never guaranteed.

Upon my exhale, I dropped my keys in my bag and turned to walk the short distance to my apartment. These past few years have been rough. I’d like to thank the movies I watched growing up for instilling the idea that prince charming would come to rescue you in your times of need. \*Fat chance. I should’ve listened better to the elders of my academy when they counseled against being that naive.\* I smiled to myself as I shuffled my feet in the snow creating furrows behind me. A small habit from childhood.   
  
  
  
Streetlights flickered to life as the sky darkened. A wave of temporary longing for the mountain country overcame me as I looked up to the semi-filled night sky. I traded crickets and whispering breezes for the steady sounds of tires against pavement. \*All for a better life,\* I reminded myself grimly. Luckily, with the deepening of snow, not many people were out. My walk was infinitely easier.   
  
  
  
Stepping into the foyer was no relief from the cold—it felt like the building itself had given up trying to keep its tenants comfortable. Greg, the landlord, frequently absent from the front desk, barely took care of the place. Wet slaps of his webbed feet usually indicated when rent was due. Greg was what happened when the government decided to mix petty criminals with amphibians. Some shadowy agency thought it’d be a great idea to fuse lowlifes with lizards, frogs, and fish. Greg? He was the unfortunate byproduct of a con man and a green tree frog. 

And somehow, that made his sleazy flirting even worse.

I fumbled in my bag for my keys, cursing in Latin as they got caught on everything inside. The rusting mailboxes loomed in front of me, mocking my struggle. A fleeting smile crossed my lips as Box 26 groaned open, its rusted hinges shrieking in protest.  Maybe Grandma had sent some cookies or a couple new pairs of mittens. What little joy I had quickly vanished from my face. Just bills. All addressed to Adriana Mills. \*Someday, I’ll be rid of that last name,\* I quipped in my head.   
  
  
  
Good Fortune and I? We were never on speaking terms. My parents had hoped that as the oldest, I would make their hopes and dreams come true. Dad was from a long line of renowned artificers and Mom was the second daughter of a well liked merchant and his wife. When I was born, I guess they were disappointed. Instead of a charismatic and handsome son, they got me. A quiet, curious girl. After several heartbreaking miscarriages and one more daughter, they gave up. Dad tried his best to tend to us girls. But I don’t think mom ever cared, even after all my efforts of trying to be the best. Neither of us were the son they wanted, nor did we care for socialite manners.  
  
  
  
At 16, I was accepted into Aldera's Academy for Alchemy. While it wasn’t tinkering on clocks or mechanical men, my father’s curiosity got the best of me. My family was convinced I’d awaken some grand magical ability during my time there. A few of my cousin’s displayed wild talents for conjuration. But, I never did. I was supposed to thrive at Aldera’s Academy, but academics never held my attention the way people did. I got along with my classmates, a few of whom tried to court me. Only one succeeded  
  
  
  
Parker, one of my fellow classmates, caught my eye. He was tall, quirky, and generally liked by the friend group. We attended an off campus party for the graduating class. One thing led to another, and nine months later, Worrick was in our arms. We tried to make it work. Really did. The sleepless nights, the unpaid bills, the growing resentment—we were kids trying to raise a kid. Stress got the best of me and I snapped at him. Heartlessly, I had said things that weighed on me. The split got messy and quick. I don’t even blame him. But Worrick and I? We had to figure it out.  
  
  
  
Worrick was a quiet baby—easygoing, slept more than he cried. He was my reason to keep going through all my dumb choices. Laughter echoed out from behind my cracked and weathered oak door. Jett, Breggor’s new short-order cook, had an uncanny habit of showing up right when I needed a break. Lately, he’d been spending more time at our place, and Worrick adored him. When he offered to babysit a couple of days a week, I didn’t think twice.

The best daycares in the city cost over 200 gold a week—way out of my price range as a shop owner. Mid-city daycares were more affordable at 100 silver a week. The werebear who ran the daycare readily welcomed him in. Something about increased government funding for diversity—apparently, having a human kid helped their numbers. I didn’t mind. Worrick seemed to enjoy himself. He needed more friends. 

Slowly, I peeked into my tiny, dilapidated one-bedroom apartment. Jett was playing with Worrick. A laugh plastered on his round little face with chocolate brown eyes filled with glee as he was tossed into the air. Watching them together, a flicker of something I hadn’t felt in years stirred inside me—hope. A dangerous thing to hold onto. 

“Alright,” I called while walking in. “We don’t need Greg charging me for the toddler-sized hole in the roof.” Jett caught Worrick and spun around to face me. “Oops, my bad. But can you blame me? The kid loves it,” he grinned, his chuckle light and carefree. Worrick jumped down and ran into my arms. “Mama!”

I hugged him in my usual big bear hug. “Hey baby, what did you do all day?” I asked him crouching down and watching glee further brighten his face. “I went to trampolines, and went to Baslik Burger. Jett got sooo many chicken buttons!” He exclaimed proudly, stretching  his little arms out as far as possible. I quietly giggled at his exasperation.""Oh, he did? Mr. Jett must really love chicken buttons,"" I teased.

Jett lingered as Worrick clung to me, watching the interaction with a small, knowing smile. He was comfortable here—maybe too comfortable. Before I could say anything, he stretched, glancing at the clock. “It’s late. I’ll just crash on the couch tonight, yeah?”

It wasn’t really a question.

I hesitated, but Worrick cheered. “Yay! Jett stays!”

I sighed. “Fine.”

Jett grinned like he had won something. His room was filled with plastic dinosaurs and cars. I kneeled down and let go of him as I got his Charles the cat onesie. He picked up his trucks and dinosaurs quickly. “Come on Wor, bath time” I called to him.

“Thanks again for watching Worrick,” I said with a half smile. Since Jett came into the picture, the world didn’t seem so unsafe and unforgiving. Most guys I dated after Parker and I split only seemed to be interested in one thing other than Worricks snacks. Jett came across as lonely and in need of company. ""Don't worry about it. You know I’d do anything for you two. I don’t mind picking up the slack where others won’t. Kyla and I always talked about kids… guess she wasn’t interested in having one with fae blood."" His jaw tightened at the mention of his ex-fiancée.

The tension in his jaw didn't go unnoticed, but I didn’t press it. Jett had a way of veiling his emotions, his bitterness slipping through only in moments like this, where a casual mention of his past seemed to unravel the calm mask he'd built. It wasn’t my place to poke at the cracks, especially when we had more pressing things to focus on—like making sure Worrick didn’t make a mess of the living room.

I leaned back, my fingers idly stroking the rim of the tea mug. ""You know, you're good with him. Better than I would be.""

Jett gave me a soft, almost shy smile, the kind that made my heart beat a little faster. “I’m good with him because I care. And I care about you too, Addy. You and Worrick… You’re family.”

The words felt warm, like the blanket of security I’d wrapped around myself ever since he entered our lives. But I couldn’t help but wonder—was this all too good to be true? Or had I simply forgotten what safe really felt like?

During one of the many weekend adventures Worrick led, we ran into Jett at a coffee cart. We had only met him a week prior at Breggor’s while on a “Food Raid”. The coffee cart was parked outside of Worrick’s favorite playground. Children's laughter and distant shouts blended into the background as we swapped stories of past misadventures. He told me of Kyla and how he thought he had found the one. She was a high ranking noble’s daughter. Pretty, tall, thin, and blonde. Total knock-out. He even showed me a picture of her. Kyla looked like she could be a runway model. With a little prodding and the promise of another chai tea, I told him about Parker.

After a few hours, we parted ways with each other’s numbers and a newfound camaraderie. Worrick began begging me to keep going back to Breggo’s week after week. Soon we became regulars on Sunday morning for pancakes and bacon. Each week, Jett seemed to lighten up more and more. One Wednesday morning, my usual babysitter called me. She had come down with the phoenix flu. Not knowing another soul in this city, I hastily called Jett. Less than 15 minutes later, he stood in my doorway with Charles the Cat and two 20 piece chicken nugget meals.

By 9 p.m., Worrick was out like a light.. I opened the fridge and grabbed my usual pre-made salad. I was focused on shredding the chicken when a half-full wine glass slid into view.  “You look like you had a rough day,” Jett commented, swirling his own wine.Even leaning casually against my cheap laminate countertop, he looked out of place. With his perfectly angled jaw and lean build, he looked like he could be a model at  Ashalmel’s. “Samhain always sees a spike in sales. People want to know they will be safe when the spirits come,” I said dryly. ""You know, you could hire someone to help. It’d give you more time with Worrick—and maybe take some weight off your shoulders,"" he said, swirling his wine.

I grabbed my bowl and sat on the worn loveseat. “The problem is finding someone reliable. With the pugs and bugs at each other’s throats, people are looking for anything to rip off,” I said, stabbing the veggies with increasing frustration. “Easy, Addy. Nothing’s gonna happen to the shop. The gang war is on the other side of Aldera. I’m sure someone is reliable enough for you to hire,” he said sitting down on the other end. He had a point. 

Swallowing my bite of tomato, “I know. It just feels ***weird*** having someone else in my shop.” I rolled my shoulders back. I had a hard time trusting others after going through rough times. Jett rested his arm on the back of the love seat, barely missing me with his finger tips. “You learned to trust me with Worrick,” He added. Another good point.True, but this is my money,"" I shot back. His eyes rolled in response. “Just, give them 90 days. If it works, it works.” The fork clanked on the side of the bowl as I finished my salad ""Fine. I’ll put up an ad tomorrow,"" I sighed, defeated. Jett smiled at me as he sipped his wine. I got up and cleaned up my dinner dishes. 

As I cleared my dishes, Jett’s gaze lingered on me, but it was hard to pinpoint if he was studying me or just lost in thought. Either way, I could feel his eyes on my back, a subtle pressure that always seemed to settle in the room when he was nearby. The way he always made everything seem so effortless, even something as simple as suggesting I hire someone, was a double-edged sword. He made it seem so easy, but his words always carried that underlying weight, like he knew exactly what to say to get me to see things his way.

“You sure you’re okay with it?” Jett asked, his voice low, like he could tell I was distracted, but didn’t want to press.

I shot him a quick glance over my shoulder, trying to keep my tone light. ""Yeah, it's just hard. I’ll figure it out.""

He nodded, though I wasn’t sure if he believed me. He never pressed when I said something like that—he let it hang in the air, leaving me to think I’d convinced him. It’s what made him so good at what he did. He knew when to push, when to back off, and when to let me settle into my own thoughts.

He took another sip of his wine, his eyes narrowing slightly, like he was making a mental note of something. “I know you’ll figure it out. You always do.”

It felt almost like a compliment, but there was something in the way he said it that made me wonder if he meant something deeper—like he didn’t quite trust me to do it alone. Or maybe it was just his way of reminding me how much he was *there*, always lurking in the background, always a constant. It wasn’t a bad thing, but sometimes it felt a little like I was being wrapped in a comfort blanket that I didn’t fully understand.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Steam curled around me as the hot water washed away the day. My muscles unwound, the tension of endless haggling and impossible customers finally melting down the drain.

A goblin woman had spent an hour trying to haggle me down on crystal pendants. When I refused, she shrieked for the manager—only to realize, too late, that *I* was the manager. One hour and one very disgruntled she-goblin later, the crystal pendants were right where I left them.

I exhaled, letting the heat work its magic. *Gods, I needed this.*

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Jett’s breathing was slow, steady—syncing with the rise and fall of his chest. He was already asleep.

Sleep evaded me.

*What am I doing?*

*I swore*—*no more guys.* *It never ends well*. *They always promise the world at first, then fail to live up to it.*

*Jett is going to be no different.*

*I need to get myself together.*

*Men hurt.*

I rolled over and huffed quietly as I tried to block out the thoughts and feelings. Instead focusing on the excitement of tomorrow.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

The bustling city quietly hummed outside my window as I restocked the last of my Helichrysum bags. Everything in the shop gleamed with polish and pride as I looked around.  *Oh right. The ad.*  I reminded myself. I sighed as I meandered towards the large mahogany bar that served as my counter. With the whirring of mechanical parts and the crackling of the fireplace, I worked myself up to getting an idea of what I wanted to say in the ad.

*Wanted: Meticulous person for shop aid. Must have knowledge of reagents and tomes. Must be reliable and punctual. Serious applicants only. Bring resume to 1462 E 63rd St. Aldera.*

There, short and sweet. No need to complicate things. I went to the internet job board for Aldera and set up an account. I stared at the golden letters spelling out “Alchemist’s Rest” over the hearth. This place had been mine alone for so long—my work, my sanctuary. The idea of handing any part of it over felt… strange. *Still, maybe Jett had a point. Maybe it was time to let someone in.*

Within an hour, my first applicant arrived. Galan Rooblesteam—a young halfling barely taller than the counter, his grease-streaked sleeves matching the smudges on his resume—beamed as he handed it over. He was studying artificing at Aldera Community College and had years of hands-on experience in his family’s shop. He had also touched on the properties of Herbalism.  
  
A handful of others trickled in throughout the afternoon, most with little experience—students chasing tech or law degrees, hoping for easy work. None stood out. Then she arrived. A Jatayoo sauntered in, her movements as slow and deliberate as a stalking predator.

“Are you the owner of such a place?” she purred, her voice like silk over steel. The firelight caught the golden rings in her coat, shimmering with each calculated step. My right eyebrow raised. “I am, may I ask who you are?” I questioned. “Karta Seela,” she remarked, picking up a vial and inspecting it. “Do you have a resume you’d like to drop off?” I asked her shifting uncomfortably on the bar stool. “Yes,” Karta purred again, handing me a scroll without glancing my way.

On it was a list of employers ranging decades. I knew Jatayoo lived long lives, but her resume indicated almost 50 years of shopkeep jobs. “Impressive,” I stated gleaning information. ""I skimmed the list. Most of these names meant nothing to me. Antique dealers?""” She placed the vial back with deliberate care, her sharp eyes flicking to mine, as if gauging my reaction.""Of course,"" she said smoothly, tapping the scroll. ""And a few traders I've crossed paths with…here and there.""  
  
She grinned slightly showing the bottom of her fangs. “I will return in a few days for your decision. I hope to find it, agreeable,” She commented. Stalking out the door in the same alluring manner she came in.",0,1741678870.0,writers,1,0.5,False

I've been slack with my supplements and general health for the last few years after going through some trauma and am now trying to get back on top of things.

My plan is to create a blend of powder form supplements to add into a smoothie with banana & honey in the morning and evenings, for consistency and simplicity. Hopefully making it easier to stick with the regime opposed to my previous method of taking a bunch of pills (which I hate) and measuring out each ingredient every day.

I'm 32, male, 186cm tall, currently 100kg but on my way back down to 90kg, fairly muscular but also have a decent beer gut, work a high intensity stressful sales job 9-5, 5 days a week.

I usually go for a 2 hour hike or cycle on Tuesdays, and a 30 min hike/run followed by 2 hours of weights on Thursdays. On the weekends I'll either be doing gardening, renovations, hanging at the beach or national parks, or nothing physical at all, so 50/50 whether I'll be active on the weekends.

I have had lifelong issues with anxiety, depression, lethargy, insomnia, sleep apnoea. I'm an alcoholic & have a nicotine addiction (ex smoker, now vaper). Also I've been told by a psych I have ADHD, which I already knew, but I don't find it to be a problem, more of a super power.

I smoke a joint before bed to help with sleep, take 15mg Mirtazapine before bed, and have a CPAP machine which helps immensely (AHI of 45 now down to 1)

My average diet usually consists of a coffee for breakfast, large lunch usually consisting of a salad, chicken & pasta, and either skip dinner or have something light.

My goal is to just generally feel better, more energetic, less anxious, more focused throughout the day, and be able to relax and sleep better at night without relying on crutches like alcohol and THC.

Before you comment ""just stop drinking"" I KNOW, I know it will fix the majority of my issues, but as anyone here who has had a problem with alcohol you will know that it's not that simple. I still suffer from the anxiety, sleep problems and depression even when I'm clean for 6+ months, and that eventually leads me back down the rabbit hole. This daily supplement routine is designed to help me keep out of that damn hole.

Here's my current list, I'd love to hear some feedback, additions, changes, advice, experiences.

Morning:

Agmatine Sulphate 1000mg  
Creatine Monohydrate 5000mg  
L-Tyrosine 500mg  
L-Theanine 200mg  
Vitamin B6 (P-5-P) 100mg

Whether it's a casual coffee or a group gathering, our app aims to make meet-ups more equitable.

I’d love for you to give it a try and share your thoughts: [Somewhere in the Middle](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/somewhere-in-the-middle/id6741797806)

I’ve heard of this kind of thing happening to people, but I never thought it would happen to me.

This guy had been asking me out for a while, wanting to take me to a fancy sushi place, but I have a rule—I don’t go to expensive places on first dates because I don’t want to put pressure on the guy to pay, and I also don’t want to go somewhere I wouldn’t feel comfortable covering myself. So, I suggested something chill, like a walk and coffee. He agreed, but on the day of, he suddenly had to take his mom’s car to the mechanic and asked to push the date to dinner. Then, he asked again if I was down for sushi. I figured, okay, I have a job now, I can treat myself—why not?

I get to the restaurant, and he shows up looking like he just rolled out of bed. Now, I’m not someone who judges based on clothes, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. But then, the conversation started. His entire vibe was off—super weird energy, only speaking in Hindi despite me responding in English, and just generally not someone I was vibing with. Now, I don’t have an issue with Hindi at all—I speak Hindi all the time—but the way he spoke just felt… odd. It wasn’t just the accent; it was almost like he assumed I wouldn’t be comfortable speaking English, which was strange. I got the sense that maybe he had some presumptions about my language skills because I was born in India, while he moved to the U.S. before I did. It just made the whole conversation feel off. But I stayed polite, tried to keep the conversation going, and focused on making it through dinner.

I ordered the cheapest thing on the menu (tempura prawns), and he got tempura chicken. Everything seemed fine until, towards the end of the meal, the waitress asked if we needed more time. I looked at him, and he said, “Yeah, give us five more minutes.” Cool, whatever. Then, two minutes later, he suddenly goes, “I think my mom’s mechanic is calling, do you mind if I step out to take this?” I said, “Sure, no problem.”

He walked out… and never came back.

Within minutes, I had this gut feeling that something was off. I opened Instagram, and boom—I was blocked. Checked Hinge—unmatched. Called him—unreachable. Looked around—he was gone.

At this point, I’m sitting there, absolutely stunned, realizing I’ve just been left with the bill at a place I didn’t even want to go to in the first place. I was in shock for a solid 30 minutes, just processing the fact that this guy literally ditched me mid-meal, blocked me, and disappeared. Like… what was the plan here? Did he come with the intention of doing this? Was this some kind of weird scam?

I genuinely cannot believe this happened. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Because I feel like I just got punk’d in real life.

Edit: I am a conventionally good looking woman,and not to sound too confident but I definitely had better conversational skills than him. So it can’t be him just not being interested in me lol. ",4,1741678025.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I've been slack with my supplements and general health for the last few years after going through some trauma and am now trying to get back on top of things.

My plan is to create a blend of powder form supplements to add into a smoothie with banana & honey in the morning and evenings, for consistency and simplicity. Hopefully making it easier to stick with the regime opposed to my previous method of taking a bunch of pills (which I hate) and measuring out each ingredient every day.

I'm 32, male, 186cm tall, currently 100kg but on my way back down to 90kg, fairly muscular but also have a decent beer gut, work a high intensity stressful sales job 9-5, 5 days a week.

I usually go for a 2 hour hike or cycle on Tuesdays, and a 30 min hike/run followed by 2 hours of weights on Thursdays. On the weekends I'll either be doing gardening, renovations, hanging at the beach or national parks, or nothing physical at all, so 50/50 whether I'll be active on the weekends.

I have had lifelong issues with anxiety, depression, lethargy, insomnia, sleep apnoea. I'm an alcoholic & have a nicotine addiction (ex smoker, now vaper). Also I've been told by a psych I have ADHD, which I already knew, but I don't find it to be a problem, more of a super power.

I smoke a joint before bed to help with sleep, take 15mg Mirtazapine before bed, and have a CPAP machine which helps immensely (AHI of 45 now down to 1)

My average diet usually consists of a coffee for breakfast, large lunch usually consisting of a salad, chicken & pasta, and either skip dinner or have something light.

My goal is to just generally feel better, more energetic, less anxious, more focused throughout the day, and be able to relax and sleep better at night without relying on crutches like alcohol and THC.

Before you comment ""just stop drinking"" I KNOW, I know it will fix the majority of my issues, but as anyone here who has had a problem with alcohol you will know that it's not that simple. I still suffer from the anxiety, sleep problems and depression even when I'm clean for 6+ months, and that eventually leads me back down the rabbit hole. This daily supplement routine is designed to help me keep out of that damn hole.

Here's my current list, I'd love to hear some feedback, additions, changes, advice, experiences.

Morning:

Agmatine Sulphate 1000mg  
Creatine Monohydrate 5000mg  
L-Tyrosine 500mg

I want to understand the correct way of approaching women and building a connection that leads to a relationship. I've struggled with maintaining attraction and making things last beyond the talking stage. I’m looking for practical advice on how to confidently approach women in real-life settings without relying on dating apps.

Context:
I'm a 23-year-old man who has been single all my life. I’ve had talking stages with a few women I liked, but they often lose interest once the initial attraction fades. I've tried Tinder, Bumble, and Facebook Dating but barely get matches. When I do, many matches don't reply. My friends tell me I look decent, but I suspect they might just be trying to be nice. I’m skeptical about the advice to ""just be confident"" since I feel that physical attractiveness still plays a big role in getting attention. I’ve been working on myself physically and socially—improving my appearance, health, and social skills—but I still struggle to create meaningful connections.

Previous Attempts:

Tried various dating apps with limited success.
Worked on improving my physical appearance (cleared my skin, lost weight, used hair-thickening products).
Improved my social skills by talking to people on apps and in random conversations.
Focused on self-love and self-improvement, but it hasn't translated into dating success.

As Utah County flaunts its ambition to become the tech epicenter, it's not just sunshine and silicon chips; it's facing a power conundrum. The sheer energy needs of AI are staggering with some experts warning it'll soon demand enough juice to outshine all the refrigerators in the US. Yes, those humble food coolers.

**Buckle Up: The Energy Ride of AI**

- **Power Play:** AI's growth spurt is astounding—requiring *33 times* the energy compared to other software types. It's like your tech's on a caffeine high it can't sustain.
- **Data Center Drains:** These massive centers aren’t just storage lockers; they’re energy hogs, requiring as much power as **100,000 Utah homes**. Imagine your electricity bill multiplying that much!
- **Going Nuclear:** With such high stakes, even nuclear power plants are staging a comeback to feed AI's ravenous appetite.

**Facing the Tech-tastic Future**
Not to downplay innovation—AI, when used wisely, slashes through bureaucracy like a hot knife through butter, promising efficiencies we can barely fathom, like cutting traffic delays by nearly half in Tucson. But, its power hunger might make us sip our morning coffee by candlelight.

Where will AI lead us if it continuously gnaws away at our energy resources without offering enough savings in return? Are we heading for tech nirvana or an energy apocalypse? 🔌💡

That’s the vibe over at Anthropic, where Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger is painting a fascinating picture at the Human[X] conference. Forget the hardware rack-race or designing the next binge-watching craze; Anthropic's all about serious AI business, focusing on generalist foundation models for enterprises.

**The Antics of Anthropic**

So, why aren't they diving into the shiny world of gadgets and gizmos? According to Krieger, Anthropic's mission is clear: empower every industry—from tech startups to corporate titans—with their Claude AI models. Their mantra isn't about charming consumers with entertainment but streamlining tasks from code crunching to strategic decision-making.

This is not to say they’re ignoring the consumer side completely. The Claude.ai platform offers a practical $20/month subscription that's aimed at efficiency rather than entertainment. Parents are organizing kiddo calendars, not casting the next big AI-driven TV series.

**The Road Less Traveled**

Unlike its cousin OpenAI—dabbling with design prodigies like Jony Ive for potential consumer devices—Anthropic is steering clear of the hardware aisle. Instead, they're pulling a strategic judo move by collabing with giants like Amazon. Claude isn't the main product but a powerhouse whispering brilliance to Alexa's 600 million devices.

We’ve got Krieger hinting at AI’s job market shake-up—sure, AI tools might shrink the human engineer force over time. Yet, Anthropic is still hiring while pushing limits on AI’s multimodal capabilities. The aim? Enhance vision powers to unlock even more complex uses.

**Engineer vs. AI: The Dance**

Their tech tango involves matching product spins with research breakthroughs, demanding agility quicker than your morning breath change! Krieger admits—yes, some model advancements will push engineering roles to shift, yet the company's still all about growth and breakthroughs. From visual acuity enhancements to those mythical “moonshot” projects lingering on the horizon, the AI landscape is as dynamic as ever.

I know I was a wreck after reading about the road through the legal process and everything else. 

Some background, I got a DUI in Connecticut on my birthday 2 years ago, it was my first ever actual incident with the law. After a night in holding and the on and off court dates, waited out the 1 year license suspension, during which I went through the court mandated M.A.D.D classes and was ordered to put in an IID for one year.

I ended up going with SmartStart after comparing for days and weeks, afraid of all the false positives and being stuck on the side of the road all the stuff you hear about it all being a nightmare.

Well having finished my time this last February I can tell you (from my experience) it was incredibly simple. 

I never once had a false positive. I never missed a mid-drive test like I was so afraid of being someone who has their music on 10 all the time. And even after having a drink or two the day prior my car always fired up after the initial test.

I had it installed from a SmartStart center about an hour from where I live and chose to go back to that same location for each calibration to keep the records directly with the company to reduce the risk of a slip up in the paperwork trail. 

I can’t say the stories you hear about IID’s are flukes but I ate food, drank RedBull, coffee, vaped, you name it and never had an issue. You can still drink but you do 100% need to plan for that 12 hour window so your body can process the alcohol out. The only thing I never did was use mouth wash 30min prior to driving, didn’t want to test that one.

At the end of it all, I got my letter from my state releasing me, 75$ administrative fee to smart start, 75$ labor payment to the shop for device removal, and I’m now free. The only thing I still catch myself doing is waiting in the car with the ignition on waiting to hear that beep before I start up.

Maybe I’ve just worked in particularly toxic environments, but I feel like there’s a conversation missing when we talk about gender issues in the workplace.

International Women’s Day just passed, and of course, there’s a lot of discussion around historical barriers, modern solutions, and advocating for women’s rights. But one thing I rarely hear mentioned, despite how rampant it is, is internalized misogyny.

As a woman, I was always warned about sexism or misogyny in the workplace typically involving male colleagues, and while I don’t doubt those experiences exist, I’ve personally been lucky in that most of the men I’ve worked with have been great and genuinely supportive in all my endeavours. What has been a challenge, however (and this feels almost taboo to say) is the way some women treat other women in professional environments.

I’ve witnessed bullying, harassment, and exclusion, and it’s been particularly disheartening because these are women I looked up to and wanted to connect with. One instance that sticks with me is when I grabbed coffee with a highly successful woman in her field, hoping to learn from her. Instead of guidance, she told me I was a “people pleaser full of fluff with nothing to show for it.” This was our first conversation and I was only an intern then.

I’ve seen female leaders who feel threatened by younger counterparts and either fire them or make their work lives unbearable until they quit. I’ve seen women discourage their female colleagues from advancing because they were “too soft” or dressed “too feminine” to ever be taken seriously. I’ve seen women openly criticize each other’s appearance, spread rumors, and even imply that their female peers have sexual relationships with male colleagues or clients, directly undermining professional collaboration.

Women (and even those inn leadership) have sometimes displayed microaggressions toward those who take maternity leave, while attractive female colleagues often become bigger targets where their competency is constantly questioned, and they’re excluded. I’ve seen female managers berate female employees only to turn around and act completely different with male counterparts. I’ve even witnessed some use their position to actively block opportunities for other women, seemingly for no reason other than insecurity or competition. Oh, and God forbid if you're neurodivergent but don't ""look"" like it!

A respected female CEO who was reknowned in the industry, even once told me i should take advantage of my youth and looks to get ahead. Whatever that means.

This isn’t to say that all women do this or that it’s a more significant problem than systemic sexism. But internalized misogyny is very real, and I don’t think we talk about it enough. Women should be supporting each other, but in many cases, we are our own worst critics.

So, to all the pre-10 a.m. yappers: please, for the love of caffeine, let me wake up in peace. I’m not a morning person—I’m just a person who happens to be awake in the morning. There’s a difference.  

Sincerely,  
A Sleep-Deprived Grump

Around 10 PM, he suddenly woke me up and started talking about something I didn’t understand. Half-awake and confused, I kept asking him what he meant, but I couldn’t process what he was saying. He mentioned something about the ""chopping board of the neighbor,"" and that’s when I realized he was sleep-talking.  

I kept questioning him again, kasi nga I was confused, he got annoyed and ended up shouting at me. That really disappointed me. I’ve already told him before that I don’t like being yelled at, especially when someone is mad. It reminds me too much of my father, which is something I hate.  

After that, di ako makatulog. Instead of trying to talk it out, nag phone nalang ako. Nagigising sya once in a while and tells me to stop using it and just sleep since we had work in the morning. But I didn’t respond and continued using my phone. He kept scolding me, but I really couldn’t sleep. I had coffee before bed, and I also struggle to sleep when I’m upset (which he knows about).  

Around 1 AM, nagising sya ulit and he finally said, “Dami mong arte!” That was it. I closed my phone kasi naiiyak na ako. Since he was right next to me, I tried to keep quiet, but I couldn’t hold it in anymore, so I went to the bathroom and cried there. It felt too heavy.  

A few moments later, he followed me and apologized for what he said.  

So, is it really my fault that I couldn’t go back to sleep after he woke me up? I was already annoyed because he kept sighing loudly, which made it even harder for me to relax. And in the end, I was the one left struggling to sleep.",1,1741676765.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

Then his voice… 
We started seeing each other basically every day.
In the house you both used to.
Same mattress.
Same painting you hang on the wall and he hated it.
He used to only say bad things about you.
The only good one was that you reconnected him with his sister - and i used to be so jealous of it.
I wanted to do that for him.
I wanted to travel the world with him just like you did.
I wanted to be with him when his world fell apart.
Then you have “extreme fatigue disease” and can’t get out of bed for more than 1 hour per day.
He feels sorry for you.
You keep inviting him for a coffee.
He promised me to always let me know when you guys were in touch.
Such a silly promise.
He failed it. 
On the week we got married i have found out.
He was saying he felt sorry for you, he told you he got a house and his life was much better than yours.
Dinners with his family full of tears and them
Missing you.
He forgot to share with you we were getting married.
I screamed and cried.
I called the wedding off.
First time he yelled at me was because of you. 
Because i have asked him to constantly talk about you to my father and the “we” wasn’t me and him. Was you and him.
I do feel you are still the one.
Your cousin stalking me… 
If it is what make both of you happy take him.
I just want you to know jess, 
Im so jealous of you.
I wanted to be there for him before i have met him.
You met his sister.
You helped him to reconnect to her before she died.
You have met lucy.
I couldn’t fight over that.
To the ghost that you were, 
I hope you are happy.
I envy you. ",2,1741676639.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

It was there that it began. He ignored it at first, telling himself that there weren't any helicopters in the fourteenth century, not even in the heads of Florentine polymaths, but every time he heard it fading away, it would soon begin to return until it sounded like it was directly over his head again. Looking out the windows, he tried to map its course and became convinced that the only place it consistently returned to was Malevich Square. He was also convinced that the other block's CCTV cameras were all pointing directly at his flat, as were the eyes of the obligatory zephyr in the doorway of East Block. Shutting the blinds and backing off, he stared at them with fists and face clenched, as if willing the imagined threats beyond them to leave him alone. He began to nervously pace around, and everywhere he went he found fresh evidence that someone must have been in his flat. That book wasn't on top of that pile before, was it? Those cushions were never left in that position, were they? It doesn't make sense to have that lamp pointing in that direction, does it? There could be a listening device in there, he thought, I'd better get a screwdriver from the kitchen. There should be another knife in that block, shouldn't there? He didn't usually keep the toaster plugged in, did he? That drawer's never left open like that, is it? That little screwdriver wouldn't normally be on the top like that, would it?

Sat on the floor, surrounded by parts of his lamp, toaster and telephone, and a pile of screws that could have gone anywhere, K noticed that the sound of the helicopter was gone. He checked out the windows and the skies were clear. He checked below and the square was zephyr-less. The cameras were still pointing at his window but that meant they weren't pointing at the main entrance so, grabbing his coat, keys and wallet, he quickly made his escape.

Once outside the block, a sugar craving hit him and he realised he hadn't eaten yet. He checked that the cameras hadn't picked him up and made his way to the Conshop on Kandinsky Street, where the checkout assistant shouted at him to remove his hood - how exposed he suddenly felt without it. He bought a Boost and a bottle of Coke, and, after checking the coast was clear, determinedly set off for Bosch Gardens, with his hood up and his head down. He headed straight for the bench by the stream and was relieved to find it unoccupied. It was the only place he could think of with a clear view of the main field and no easy access from behind - it would be hard for anyone to sneak up on him.

Half an hour later, he'd managed to calm his heart rate down to a reasonable level and had nearly talked himself out of the delusion that his flat had been bugged, when the black helicopter reappeared. Why had he prioritised vigilance over concealment? The fact that he even considered running and diving for cover in the trees, like a 1970's Vietnamese farmer, finally convinced him that the situation was getting out of hand, and he should probably get some help. Dr Sinha had told him he could drop in anytime and this psychotic episode, or whatever it was, seemed like a pretty good reason to take her up on that offer. Nevertheless, he was feeling a little too vulnerable to get on a bus - the average zephyr's preferred mode of transport - so the hour-long walk was the only reasonable solution.

""What do you mean she's not here?"" said an exhausted K. ""She said I could drop in anytime I want. Those were her exact words, in fact."" The receptionist looked over K's shoulder, at the security guard by the entrance.

""That doesn't sound like something Dr Sinha would say to a patient.""

""I'm not just a patient, I'm a case study - I'm a super-looper!"" The security guard positioned herself at a non-threatening but immediately available distance.

""Be that as it may, if Dr Sinha did say that, I'm sure she meant *anytime she's here* and she doesn't work Friday afternoons, so I'm sorry, Mr...""

""I can phone her,"" said K. ""She also said I could phone her. Can I use your phone?""

""By all means, dial nine first,"" she place a landline in front of him while he frantically searched his pockets and wallet.

""I don't have her number on me, do you have it?""

""I'm afraid we can't give out that sort of confidential information, sir, you understand.""

""Yes, of course - I'm sorry.""

""All our doctors are fully booked this afternoon but, if it's an emergency, we can call an ambulance for you."" An ambulance? thought K, why would you think I need an ambulance?... wait, they're trying to get me committed. I'm not crazy, I'm just a little... crazy.

""I'm fine! Perfectly fine, just a misunderstanding... My throat's a little dry though, is there any chance I could get a glass of water, please?"" K sat down in the waiting area and tried to look as normal as possible, while he rested his legs... and his brain. He was too tired to walk home and to get the bus he would have to venture into the centre of town, where he was sure those hundreds of CCTV cameras would all be looking right at him. And, of course, there'd be zephyrs everywhere - whole gangs of them. He asked for another plastic cup of water and rested a bit more. If the security guard hadn't kept eyeing him up and down, he would have stayed even longer, but the tension became unbearable.

Hanging around outside a Weatherman's bar and restaurant, further down Rembrandt Way towards the dreaded centre of town, he couldn't make out much activity inside and, agitated by his catalytic bladder, decided to risk it. It sounded a lot busier inside than it had looked through the window but, too self-conscious to conduct a rough headcount, he headed straight for the solitary barman. ""You need to take your hood off, mate - sorry, company policy, the cameras need to be able to see your face."" He waved his finger at the ceiling behind him and K reactively looked up thinking - that's kind of the point... mate. He looked at his feet, removed the hood, apologised and asked where the toilet was. ""Patrons only, mate - sorry, company policy."" For a second, K thought he'd said ""patriots only"" and wondered if the camera had sent an alert to the barman's till screen warning him of an enemy incursion. He was thinking about what he wanted to drink when his rumbling stomach interrupted his deliberations.

""Food!"" he said to it, as if the answer to a particularly difficult question had just come to mind. The barman pointed to a menu taped to the bar. ""Cheeseburger and fries, please.""

""With or without bacon?""

""With.""

""Anything to drink?""

""Coffee... black... Amerikano... black Amerikano.""

""Where are you sitting?""

""I'm not sitting anywhere.""

""Where are you going to sit?""

""I don't know yet.""

""You need to pick a table so I can put it on the system."" Forced to look around, K noticed that it wasn't as busy as it had first sounded, only a few tables were occupied and the noise he assumed had been emanating from the young men drinking beer had reached a more conversational level. He pointed at an empty table as far away from them as possible, in a corner by the window and the barman tapped his till screen. ""Toilet's that way.""

He unenthusiastically dispatched his greasy burger and overcooked fries while looking at the people on Rembrandt way. They're just everyday folk going about their everyday tasks, he told himself. He invented a game of inventing scenarios. There's an estate agent on her way home from the office with a Chinese takeaway. There's a couple of builders rolling cigarettes and bitching about their lazy foreman. There's an ex-soldier selling the *Big Issue*. There's a shopper with a dress she's just bought for the date she's got tonight with the new guy in customer service. There's a zephyr going into the leisure centre to spy on him from one of those windows, wait for him to leave the pub and follow him into the bus station where he can stab him in the stomach and leave him spewing blood and undigested beef on the floor while he blends into the crowd and makes his getaway on the number twenty-seven. Game over. Knowing he was being irrational but checking the windows anyway, he remembered Dr Sinha mentioning a mindfulness session at this leisure centre on Friday evenings. He thought it could be the perfect place to hide until the centre of town reached a relatively navigable population density and, although he doubted it would be much help, it was unlikely to make him *more* stressed. Checking his watch, he had forty minutes to kill, so he ordered another coffee.

After instantly forgetting the receptionist's directions and self-consciously hauling his skinny frame around the unfamiliar testosterone palace, the session had just started by the time he found his destination. It turned out that mindfulness was a lot more popular than he'd expected, and hoped, it would be, but too many was better than too few. As a relatively unfit fifty-year-old man, he was, at least, relieved to find everyone seated on a chair and not on the floor with their legs crossed. The - is ""guru"" the right word? - waved him in and continued with her instructions to ""breath in... breath out... breath in... breath out...,"" while he found somewhere to park his chakra.

Whether it was the simple repetitive technique, the seamless way the sound of his breathing threaded into the communal breeze, or just the general vibe of the place, K found himself genuinely relaxing for the first time since his medieval murder mystery had been interrupted by industrial revolutions. ""I hope you're all feeling nice and relaxed,"" said the guru. ""Please open your eyes and let your breathing return to normal. Feel free to talk among yourselves, but try to keep it light. We'll continue in a few minutes.""

""Oh, hi Joe,"" said a voice on his left. He turned his head, saw a familiar toothless grin and immediately passed out.

K's eyes slowly focused on the three faces looking down at him. The first he didn't recognise, the second was the guru and the third was definitely Zephyr - the one and only, original Zephyr. K had walked in there and sat right next to him without even noticing. Without a hooded top on, the real thing didn't match the archetype and didn't even register in his psyche. ""How are you feeling?"" said the guru, handing him a plastic cup of water.

""I'm fine,"" he said.

""You've only been out a few seconds but if you'd like us to call the centre's emergency response team...""

""No, really, I'm fine."" He actually did feel better than he'd felt for most of the day. Maybe because he knew exactly where Zephyr was - he was right in front of him.

""You really had us worried for a second there, Joe, I've never seen anything like it,"" he said. ""Do you have any idea what brought that on?""

""No.""

""This experience can be a little unnerving the first time,"" said the guru. ""Some people can feel a little exposed.""

""Exposed, yes, that must be it,"" said K. ""I'm sorry I disturbed everyone's peace.""

""As long as you're alright, that's the main thing,"" she said.

""Maybe he could do with some fresh air,"" said Zephyr.

""Yes, maybe I could do with some fresh air,"" said K. He and Zephyr went outside.

""Maybe you could do with a pint,"" said Zephyr.

""Yes, maybe I could do with a pint,"" said K. He and Zephyr crossed the road.

Ten minutes later, K was back in the Weatherman's having a drink with his stalker at the very same table where, a little over an hour ago, he'd vividly imagined a horrific scenario in which the man had stabbed him to death. It was becoming obvious that the real thing was nowhere near as frightening as the monster he'd created in his head. Also, if Zephyr did want to kill him, at least he'd bought him a pint first. ""I still owe you for the Black Bottom,"" he'd explained. ""I did try to call you a couple of times, left a couple of messages.""

""Sorry, I've been really busy with my case."" K couldn't put his finger on it but there was definitely something different about him and it wasn't just the short-sleeve shirt and the smart haircut. He looked healthier. He looked happy. Those mindfulness classes must be working miracles.

""How's it going?""

""In limbo,"" said K. ""Or purgatory, more like.""

""I saw the article in *The Afterglow*, didn't that speed it up a bit?""

""How would I know? they don't tell me anything. I feel like it's become a black hole - I can't see it but it keeps sucking in matter from the surrounding space, stuff that shouldn't have anything to do with me. I know that sounds... things have been a bit crazy, lately... I've been a bit crazy, lately. I feel like my minds been playing tricks on me. I've been drawing nonsensical conclusions from contradictory evidence and seeing things that aren't there - I don't know what to believe... I don't know who to believe.""

""I know exactly how you feel, believe me... sorry, I shouldn't have said that - old habits...""

""What about *your* case?""

""Old Foster worked his magic like I knew he would. It took it all out of him, though - the poor guy could hardly walk by the end of the trial and it turned out to be his last time in court. I got a suspended sentence, which upset a lot of people who wanted to see me go to prison, and I can't say I blame them. I got five hundred hours community service, which puts me in touch with people who need to hear what I have to say. And I was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, which turned into therapy, which turned into the best thing that ever happened to me. I was a very sick man, in both senses of the word. I couldn't face up to my own personal issues so I projected them onto the world until I'd built up a spiralling web of paranoid delusions... so I do have some empathy with how you're feeling, Joe.""

""So you no longer believe all that stuff you told me in the Black Bottom?""

""I can't even remember what I said. I was imagining injustice everywhere, then, as if there isn't enough real injustice to be angry about. There may have been some of *that* in there, but a lot of it, no doubt, was whatever wild interpretation of fake news, false memories and fucked-up reasoning I sincerely believed on that particular day. It doesn't matter, anyway - as far as mental health goes, the truth doesn't mean shit, what matters is your relationship with what you believe. I was letting my beliefs eat me up inside and drive me deeper into a rage and depression that I couldn't recognise as the real problem. I'd made the world the problem, and the worse I made it, the less important my own shortcomings became in comparison, until I stopped taking any responsibility for my own behaviour, my own mistakes. I came to believe that all my failures in life were a direct consequence of my beatific refusal to sell my soul to the devil. Success only happens if you give in to temptation and, when you live in a world that equates success with fame, there's plenty of 'proof'. The more you look for symbols and rituals and immorality in the lives of celebrities, the more you find, until they all become part of some Faustian cult of satanic paedophiles. It wasn't just the lies I'd told about celebrities, though, they're used to it, and they have a PR machine in front of them soaking it all up. Other people had their lives ruined by the hatred I'd spread online - they told me so at the trial. A dentist had his surgery windows smashed. A teacher with two young daughters had human faeces put through her cat-flap. A retired teacher was assaulted outside his home. Most of them got loads of obscene letters and online abuse. Some people had to move home because their kids couldn't go to school any more. One of my videos inspired a fifteen-year-old boy to spray-paint *paedo* all over someone's house, climbing up the drainpipe and everything - one of the neighbours filmed it. One of my biggest followers was this Amerikan I'd talked to hundreds of times, who I'd been arranging to meet up with... Turns out he was making fake images of some of my victims fucking their own kids and sending the 'proof' to their Facebook contacts... I'll never forgive myself for what I did to those poor people... I destroyed them... They were... shells of human beings, like they'd just come back from a war zone... Seeing the hurt and anger in their faces is something that will live with me for the rest of my life... The shame... ...""

""You don't have to talk about this if you don't want to,"" said K, feeling that Zephyr was about to burst into tears. ""You shouldn't take all the responsibility on yourself, anyway. Other people overreacted to the stupid things you said - *they're* responsible for *their* actions.""

""Words matter, Joe - that's why I have to talk about this. I've become involved in a campaign against fake news. It's all about making people aware of the danger of spreading misinformation - the devastating effect it can have on innocent people's lives and the counter-intuitive effect it has on free speech. People think they're exposing the dishonesty of the mainstream media, but really they're just allowing them to become more dishonest while appearing more trustworthy. They're not holding them to account, they're making them more unaccountable.""",1,1741676274.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Game over. Knowing he was being irrational but checking the windows anyway, he remembered Dr Sinha mentioning a mindfulness session at this leisure centre on Friday evenings. He thought it could be the perfect place to hide until the centre of town reached a relatively navigable population density and, although he doubted it would be much help, it was unlikely to make him *more* stressed. Checking his watch, he had forty minutes to kill, so he ordered another coffee.

After instantly forgetting the receptionist's directions and self-consciously hauling his skinny frame around the unfamiliar testosterone palace, the session had just started by the time he found his destination. It turned out that mindfulness was a lot more popular than he'd expected, and hoped, it would be, but too many was better than too few. As a relatively unfit fifty-year-old man, he was, at least, relieved to find everyone seated on a chair and not on the floor with their legs crossed. The - is ""guru"" the right word? - waved him in and continued with her instructions to ""breath in... breath out... breath in... breath out...,"" while he found somewhere to park his chakra.

Whether it was the simple repetitive technique, the seamless way the sound of his breathing threaded into the communal breeze, or just the general vibe of the place, K found himself genuinely relaxing for the first time since his medieval murder mystery had been interrupted by industrial revolutions. ""I hope you're all feeling nice and relaxed,"" said the guru. ""Please open your eyes and let your breathing return to normal. Feel free to talk among yourselves, but try to keep it light. We'll continue in a few minutes.""

""Oh, hi Joe,"" said a voice on his left. He turned his head, saw a familiar toothless grin and immediately passed out.

K's eyes slowly focused on the three faces looking down at him. The first he didn't recognise, the second was the guru and the third was definitely Zephyr - the one and only, original Zephyr. K had walked in there and sat right next to him without even noticing. Without a hooded top on, the real thing didn't match the archetype and didn't even register in his psyche. ""How are you feeling?"" said the guru, handing him a plastic cup of water.

""I'm fine,"" he said.

""You've only been out a few seconds but if you'd like us to call the centre's emergency response team...""

""No, really, I'm fine."" He actually did feel better than he'd felt for most of the day. Maybe because he knew exactly where Zephyr was - he was right in front of him.

""You really had us worried for a second there, Joe, I've never seen anything like it,"" he said. ""Do you have any idea what brought that on?""

""No.""

""This experience can be a little unnerving the first time,"" said the guru. ""Some people can feel a little exposed.""

""Exposed, yes, that must be it,"" said K. ""I'm sorry I disturbed everyone's peace.""

""As long as you're alright, that's the main thing,"" she said.

""Maybe he could do with some fresh air,"" said Zephyr.

""Yes, maybe I could do with some fresh air,"" said K. He and Zephyr went outside.

""Maybe you could do with a pint,"" said Zephyr.

""Yes, maybe I could do with a pint,"" said K. He and Zephyr crossed the road.

Ten minutes later, K was back in the Weatherman's having a drink with his stalker at the very same table where, a little over an hour ago, he'd vividly imagined a horrific scenario in which the man had stabbed him to death. It was becoming obvious that the real thing was nowhere near as frightening as the monster he'd created in his head. Also, if Zephyr did want to kill him, at least he'd bought him a pint first. ""I still owe you for the Black Bottom,"" he'd explained. ""I did try to call you a couple of times, left a couple of messages.""

""Sorry, I've been really busy with my case."" K couldn't put his finger on it but there was definitely something different about him and it wasn't just the short-sleeve shirt and the smart haircut. He looked healthier. He looked happy. Those mindfulness classes must be working miracles.

""How's it going?""

""In limbo,"" said K. ""Or purgatory, more like.""

""I saw the article in *The Afterglow*, didn't that speed it up a bit?""

""How would I know? they don't tell me anything. I feel like it's become a black hole - I can't see it but it keeps sucking in matter from the surrounding space, stuff that shouldn't have anything to do with me. I know that sounds... things have been a bit crazy, lately... I've been a bit crazy, lately. I feel like my minds been playing tricks on me. I've been drawing nonsensical conclusions from contradictory evidence and seeing things that aren't there - I don't know what to believe... I don't know who to believe.""

""I know exactly how you feel, believe me... sorry, I shouldn't have said that - old habits...""

""What about *your* case?""

""Old Foster worked his magic like I knew he would. It took it all out of him, though - the poor guy could hardly walk by the end of the trial and it turned out to be his last time in court. I got a suspended sentence, which upset a lot of people who wanted to see me go to prison, and I can't say I blame them. I got five hundred hours community service, which puts me in touch with people who need to hear what I have to say. And I was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, which turned into therapy, which turned into the best thing that ever happened to me. I was a very sick man, in both senses of the word. I couldn't face up to my own personal issues so I projected them onto the world until I'd built up a spiralling web of paranoid delusions... so I do have some empathy with how you're feeling, Joe.""

""So you no longer believe all that stuff you told me in the Black Bottom?""

""I can't even remember what I said. I was imagining injustice everywhere, then, as if there isn't enough real injustice to be angry about. There may have been some of *that* in there, but a lot of it, no doubt, was whatever wild interpretation of fake news, false memories and fucked-up reasoning I sincerely believed on that particular day. It doesn't matter, anyway - as far as mental health goes, the truth doesn't mean shit, what matters is your relationship with what you believe. I was letting my beliefs eat me up inside and drive me deeper into a rage and depression that I couldn't recognise as the real problem. I'd made the world the problem, and the worse I made it, the less important my own shortcomings became in comparison, until I stopped taking any responsibility for my own behaviour, my own mistakes. I came to believe that all my failures in life were a direct consequence of my beatific refusal to sell my soul to the devil. Success only happens if you give in to temptation and, when you live in a world that equates success with fame, there's plenty of 'proof'. The more you look for symbols and rituals and immorality in the lives of celebrities, the more you find, until they all become part of some Faustian cult of satanic paedophiles. It wasn't just the lies I'd told about celebrities, though, they're used to it, and they have a PR machine in front of them soaking it all up. Other people had their lives ruined by the hatred I'd spread online - they told me so at the trial. A dentist had his surgery windows smashed. A teacher with two young daughters had human faeces put through her cat-flap. A retired teacher was assaulted outside his home. Most of them got loads of obscene letters and online abuse. Some people had to move home because their kids couldn't go to school any more. One of my videos inspired a fifteen-year-old boy to spray-paint *paedo* all over someone's house, climbing up the drainpipe and everything - one of the neighbours filmed it. One of my biggest followers was this Amerikan I'd talked to hundreds of times, who I'd been arranging to meet up with... Turns out he was making fake images of some of my victims fucking their own kids and sending the 'proof' to their Facebook contacts... I'll never forgive myself for what I did to those poor people... I destroyed them... They were... shells of human beings, like they'd just come back from a war zone... Seeing the hurt and anger in their faces is something that will live with me for the rest of my life... The shame... ...""

""You don't have to talk about this if you don't want to,"" said K, feeling that Zephyr was about to burst into tears. ""You shouldn't take all the responsibility on yourself, anyway. Other people overreacted to the stupid things you said - *they're* responsible for *their* actions.""

""Words matter, Joe - that's why I have to talk about this. I've become involved in a campaign against fake news. It's all about making people aware of the danger of spreading misinformation - the devastating effect it can have on innocent people's lives and the counter-intuitive effect it has on free speech. People think they're exposing the dishonesty of the mainstream media, but really they're just allowing them to become more dishonest while appearing more trustworthy. They're not holding them to account, they're making them more unaccountable.""",1,1741676185.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

The first time Clarissa smacked him, Thomas had laughed.

It was late spring in Providence, 1987. They were walking along the river, dodging stray bicyclists and the occasional overgrown tree branch. The air smelled of damp earth and freshly cut grass. Clarissa, feisty and full of life, had just made a joke about his terrible sense of direction.

""Honestly, Thomas, I don’t even know how you manage to find your way to class every morning,"" she teased.

She gave him a light slap on the arm—a playful tap, a gesture that felt more like punctuation to her words than anything else.

He grinned, rubbing his arm dramatically. “Oh no, you’ve wounded me,” he said, feigning hurt.

Clarissa rolled her eyes but smiled. He loved that smile—mischievous, full of fire.

The slaps became part of their relationship, small, teasing gestures that meant I adore you. You’re mine. We belong to each other. A tap on the shoulder when he said something dumb. A soft smack on the cheek when he made her laugh too hard. A swat on the butt when they were alone, playful and flirtatious.

By the time they were married, those little touches had become second nature.

For years, Thomas saw them as part of their rhythm.

Until, at some point, they weren’t playful anymore.


---

A sharp crack broke the quiet of the kitchen.

The coffee spoon slipped from his fingers and clattered onto the tile floor.

Thomas barely flinched. He had long stopped reacting. He simply stood at the counter, fingers tightening around his mug as the sting bloomed across his cheek. He could already feel it beginning to swell.

Clarissa, standing in her silk robe by the refrigerator, barely looked at him. “You left the bathroom a mess again,” she muttered, her tone casual, almost bored. She yawned and reached for the orange juice.

Thomas turned away, swallowing hard. He didn’t argue. He didn’t bother. He just grabbed his work bag, stepped past her, and left the house without another word.

Outside, the morning air was cold against his face, but it did nothing to cool the heat on his cheek. He could feel it pulsing, the red imprint of her palm marking him like a brand. As he started his car, he caught his reflection in the rearview mirror. The mark was already darkening.

By the time he got to work, it was impossible to hide.


---

“Jesus, Tom. She clocked you good this time.”

The break room was stale with the scent of burnt coffee and microwaved leftovers. A few of his coworkers leaned against the counter, watching him with poorly disguised amusement.

Thomas forced a laugh, pretending to rub his jaw as if it didn’t hurt. “Ah, you know. I was being a smartass.”

Kevin, his supervisor, shook his head, grinning. “Damn, man. You sure she’s not training to be a boxer?”

Laughter rippled through the room.

Thomas chuckled along with them, but it felt hollow. He wished they would stop. He wished someone—anyone—would look at him differently, with something other than amusement. But they never did.

They didn’t believe it was serious.

Maybe that was the worst part.


---

It started small.

The teasing slaps got a little sharper. A little less playful.

At first, Thomas told himself it was nothing. A bad day. A stressful week. When she smacked him hard enough for his cheek to sting, she would laugh it off, say you’re so sensitive or come on, don’t be such a baby.

And he believed her.

Because they were in love, right?

But then it wasn’t just the slaps. It was the way she spoke to him. The little digs. The way her affection curdled into something else, something mean.

At some point, he realized he was walking on eggshells.

Trying not to say anything that would set her off.

Trying not to become a joke in his own home.


---

He was still seething when he got home.

The house was quiet when he walked in, but the tension clung to the air like a storm waiting to break. Clarissa was sitting at the kitchen table, filing her nails, barely acknowledging him.

“Dinner’s in the microwave,” she said, flipping the nail file in her hand. “You’re welcome.”

Thomas tossed his bag onto the counter, his jaw tight. “You embarrassed me today.”

Clarissa barely looked up. “What are you talking about now?”

“My face.” He turned slightly, letting her see the bruise in the fading evening light. “The guys at work think it’s funny. Like I’m some kind of joke.”

She smirked, tapping a polished nail against her glass of wine. “Well, if you weren’t such a—”

He hit her before he even realized he’d moved.

The sound of the slap echoed through the kitchen, followed by the dull thud of the wine glass tipping over, rolling against the wood.

Clarissa lifted her hand to her cheek, fingers trembling against the shock of what had just happened. Slowly, she turned her head back toward him, her eyes wide, her lips slightly parted.

For the first time in years, she looked at him differently. Not with amusement. Not with disdain. With something else.

His pulse pounded in his ears. His breath came fast, shallow.

Never, in all their years together, had he raised a hand to her. Not once.

He wasn’t even the kind of man who slammed doors, who snapped back, who let anger turn to cruelty. He was the man who bit his tongue. Who took a deep breath. Who walked away.

But he hadn’t walked away this time.

Clarissa made a sound—half gasp, half choke—and tried to push herself up from the chair. Her knee buckled. She teetered.

And then she was falling.

The back of her head struck the corner of the table. The sound was dull. Wet.

Thomas’s stomach lurched.

She crumpled to the floor in an instant, her body limp, the silk of her robe pooling around her. A crimson smear streaked the edge of the table.

“Clarissa?” His voice barely came out. His knees hit the floor beside her.

She wasn’t moving.

The room blurred. His breath came in ragged gasps.

He touched her face, her skin already cooling beneath his fingertips. His chest constricted, his mind screaming at him to do something, anything—but all he could do was stare at her, his vision swimming with unshed tears.

A broken sob tore from his throat. His hands curled around her shoulders, shaking her gently.

“Clarissa, wake up. Please.”

His breath hitched.

“I love you.”

His fingers clenched around the fabric of her robe, desperate. His voice cracked, high and frantic.

“Please, hit me again.”

The house was silent.

For the first time in years… too silent.

And that silence was unbearable.

# My Friend Dave’s Experience with Gorilla Flow

Dave, an old coworker of mine from back in the day, has always been an **avid cyclist**. Even in his late 50s, he’s the guy who wakes up at the crack of dawn to hit the trails, rain or shine.

But in the past year, he started noticing something frustrating—his **frequent bathroom trips** were interrupting his rides, forcing him to plan routes around rest stops.

Worse yet, the **nagging pressure** and the feeling of **never fully emptying his bladder** had him constantly distracted.

He [gave Gorilla Flow a shot](https://theworldhealth.org/get-your-flow-back-official) after doing some research on **natural remedies for enlarged prostate**, and after a few weeks, he started noticing improvements.

His **nighttime urination decreased**, allowing him to get through the night without multiple wake-ups. On his long rides, he wasn’t pulling over nearly as often, which let him **stay focused on the road instead of his bladder**.

That said, he did mention one **small downside**—he didn’t notice an immediate **boost in overall energy** like some users claim. It helped his **urinary health**, no doubt, but he was hoping for a little extra kick in endurance.

Still, for him, the ability to get through a ride without constantly thinking about restrooms was **more than worth it**.

# Star Ratings

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Ingredient Quality** – Includes **top-tier anti-inflammatory herbs for prostate health**.

✔ **Three bottles** (90-day supply) – $59 per bottle ($177)  
✔ **Six bottles** (180-day supply) – Best value - $49 per bottle ($294)

Buying **multiple bottles** makes sense, since **natural prostate supplements** take time to show **full effects**.

1j8kpr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/agi4healthcare/comments/1j8kpr4/meet_supervisor_the_bipedal_ai_scientist/,Meet 'Supervisor': The Bipedal AI Scientist Revolutionizing Drug Discovery (and Why This Changes Everything),"**Holy shit, the future is here.** Imagine a bipedal humanoid AI scientist casually strolling through a lab, handling experiments faster than a caffeinated PhD student. Meet **‘Supervisor’** – Insilico Medicine’s new AI lab assistant that’s about to make drug discovery look like a sci-fi movie.

### 🤖 Why This Matters
- **Robots aren’t just coming for our jobs – they’re curing diseases.** Supervisor runs a *fully automated drug discovery lab*, slashing costs and timelines for developing life-saving treatments. No coffee breaks required.
- **10 billion data points? No problem.** SyntheticGestalt just dropped an AI model that chews through 10 BILLION compound datasets to predict molecular structures. It’s like ChatGPT for cancer drugs, and Japan’s government is *all in*.
- **ETH Zurich’s AI is playing 3D protein Tetris.** Their algorithm designs drug molecules that perfectly fit into protein structures – and it’s already collaborating with Roche. Take *that*, manual trial-and-error.

### 🚀 The Big Picture
- **AI is cutting drug development from ‘decades’ to ‘hold my beer’.** Traditional methods take years. These systems do it in months.
- **Your future medicine cabinet? Brought to you by robots.** From autoimmune diseases to cancer, AI-designed drugs could dominate pharma within 10 years.
- **Lab coats optional.** With fully automated labs like Insilico’s, human scientists can focus on big-picture innovation while bots handle the grunt work.

I don't think there's anything fundamentally wrong with me, people generally have positive opinions of me and I enjoy socializing. I'm a good listener and pretty much always available/willing to hang out. just how the cards fell, I guess. grew up in a small town with odd interests, moved to a small city where everyone already found their friends through high school or college. didn't go to college. that's that. 

I'm okay mostly. it's just some nights like this that I lay awake, thinking about how I went out by myself today. rode my motorcycle out and sat on a patio, enjoying the sunshine. had some lunch and drinks by myself. I went to open mic later and performed, everyone brought their friends to spend time with and cheer them on. people were kind to me, but I had nobody to share my night with really. the bartender was busy and I didn't want to butt in, so I left. 

just cried the whole way home. I can't remember the last time someone initiated spending time with me, or acted like they want to know anything about me. I have all these thoughts swirling in my head that I can't share. like, I don't think I did a good set at the open mic tonight and it made me sad. I thought the pico de gallo I had with my lunch today was really good. I usually don't leave the pico on my nachos, but idk, just felt like taking a chance, and that decision will probably make me leave the pico on stuff forever now. I had a little too much wine, so I meandered a few doors down to sit and have coffee. I drank a hot americano outside in the warm weather, and the sky was so cloudless and impossibly blue. I don't remember the last time I saw it so vivid. 

I people watched the college students, all laughing and walking in packs. I wondered what it was like. ",1,1741675461.0,self,0,1.0,False

I started by helping a local coffee shop owner set up online ordering and sell merch (like beans and swag). After some research, I landed on:

* **Square** – for online ordering and POS.
* **Shopify** – for selling merch.

The challenge is linking the two. Shopify doesn’t natively support Square payments, so syncing them adds complexity and costs. Also, setting this up requires more technical skills than expected — surprising in 2025!

Curious how other coffee shops handle this:

* What platforms are you using for online orders + merch?
* How much are you spending to stay online?
* Any easier solutions out there?

Appreciate any advice — thanks!",1,1741675390.0,coffeeshopowners,0,1.0,False

She also does not care to remember any details about my sister’s or my life and doesn’t even have patience to listen.

The sad thing is that my dad has started making decisions based on my mother’s reaction. He will not do small things like making coffee etc because he fears my mother will object. Or he’ll do it and tell my mom that we did it ourselves. I hate that my mother’s insecurity is altering our behaviour like this. Unfortunately this is making me see my dad also in a negative light.

Some of this advice was included in his most recent [GuildSomm Podcast Episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5c5otKC6SjNePso5CKCD5j?si=eae3f4d1d9914891), where Tanghe transitioned the structure of his tastings from traditional blinds to single-varietal wine paradigms. Under his mentorship, I have designed a 20-weeks Wine/Theory Program for our group to cover the testable CMS Certified varieties in a series of 12-weeks single varietal paradigm tastings, 4-weeks comparative tastings, and 4-weeks traditional, exam-format blind tastings. Tanghe and his wine shop have kindly provided wine selections for purchase as good examples of high-quality, high-typicity producers appropriate for study. This week featured Chardonnay from Cote d'Or and Maconnais, with Cabernet Sauvignon from Bordeaux and Napa Valley. I contributed one bottle of Washington State for comparison, as our group is local to the Cascade wine industry.

1j8kjg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christians/comments/1j8kjg9/what_i_learned_from_10_years_of_volunteering/,What I learned from 10 years of volunteering,"Grab a coffee, this is gonna be a long read.

When I first started volunteering in 2015, I was in rather desperate place. I have been a US green-card holder for a long time, and due my past mistakes, my chance of becoming a US citizen was slipping away. The lawyer that was handling my case advised me to do volunteer work to show my good moral character and that I was a good person.

And that's how I met the organization; I won't reveal the name here, but it's a Korean Christian volunteer organization where every Saturday we spend time with individuals with intellectual disabilties; Autism, cerebral palsy, the organization was serving all. The organization had a mission to love these folks as our friends and families, just like what Jesus told us to do. And to spread his gospel through them, by having them accept the lord as their savior.

But I did not care for any of that; I was really doing this for myself, to build a good character. I had no shame; All I wanted to do was fill out my time sheet, then leave. I also focused too much on petty and small inconveniences, whenever they screamed at me or were out of my control. I was the very definition of someone who was there physically but not spiritually. 

That's how my first 2 years went. For the next 2 years I served as one of the staff volunteers there. But all I felt were the burdens of increased responsibilities and standards I had to uphold. At the same time, I grew conscious and felt really bad about my attitude towards this volunteering; I wanted to do better, but the will clashed in my heart with the worries and discouragement from all the things I had to do.

I did spoke to several other staff volunteers as well as the head Pastor who was (And still is) the head of the organization about my concerns, and they all pretty much told me one thing; Love.

Love was what drove them to do their best, always putting happy smiles on their faces despite the heavy amount of back-end work there was. Love made them stay committed, and in their own words, ""Feeling blessed"" about doing the work. I wanted to get to know them better so I can learn how to love those we serve, but they seemed very comfortable with their own friend group circle, and there was room for me. This is when I began to pray to god; I asked him ""Why me?"", ""There are so many others who are greater me, more willing than me, and can love them better than me; Why chose me god?"". I always asked him for answers that I could understand.

Weekends were not fun for me; I had a part-time job working as the night shift, usually going from Friday nights 6/7 pm - 1/2 am, then again Saturday nights around the same time. I was always exhausted, and finding myself falling asleep during Sunday Worship and Sermon. 

I was seriously considering quitting volunteering at this time.

At the same time, a thing called ""Arrogance"" was growing inside, and I began talking about how my volunteering was one of the greatest things in my life. I felt pressured by my peers who were getting married, buying expensive cars, or going on amazing vacations, and I had to show off and boast about this amazing thing I have going in my life.

Then in December 2019, something happened that changed my view forever; The student I always spent time with, who was always a ball of positivity and happiness, wrote me a Christmas card. He told me how much he thanks me for spending time with him, how he always thought I was an amazing person throughout the organization, and hopes that I continue to serve. Then he ended with ""I love you, OP, like my own brother"".

I cried myself to sleep that night. I was so touched and moved by his words. I also came across one of the most famous bible verse that I had forgotten about:

>1 Corithians 13: 4 - 8  
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.

I came to realize I was in fact, being loved by Jesus, and it was shown through this organization. I felt so much shame that I have been serving completely in opposite way of the lord wanted me to. I was embarrassed to call myself a ""born-Christian"", and someone who grew up with a Pastor as my father.

For the next few weeks, I prayed everyday to god; I prayed for forgiveness in my arrogance, anger, and doubt when I served. I asked to please fill my heart with Joy and happiness, and to really love all the students and the organization, just like Jesus wanted. I was so excited to start the new year with this resolve. It was 2020.

As we all remember, COVID outbreak happened, and of course we had to cancel meeting face to face. The weekends without volunteering, something that I wanted so much in the past, felt void and empty.  We did host a couple of drive-thru events in the parking lot, but it wasn't enough to satisfy the resolution I had at the beginning of the I was left confused and sad. I wondered why God would allow this to happen? This time, I did not ask God for answers, but to please let his will be done, and have us meet in-person with smiles all around. 

When things finally started to return to normal, we opened our doors again, but all of the volunteers I've come to know were gone; It was just me and the head Pastor. Both of us knew just the two of us won't be enough, so we sought help, and soon found volunteers from local Korean churches who were willing to spend time here on Saturdays. I was happy, but also was worried about meeting these new volunteers. 

This is when I saw how amazing God is for the second time because all the volunteers who came in were amazing! Despite this being the first time spending with individuals of intellectual disabilities, they served with smiles on their faces. During the meeting after the main session, all of them said how blessed and happy they were here to serve, and it just such a good time for them. I came to realize God would never abandon this place, the people here, and is where his presence and glory can be felt to the bones. 

Now I'm nearing 10 years mark, and through this organization, God has blessed me with so many things; US citizenship was approved, my acceptance and graduating from both my undergrad and Master's program, the amazing job I have right now, and fact that I'm sharing this very testimony with you guys wasn't possible with my own being; I give all the credit to our heavenly father. But most importantly, I felt a spiritual growth and maturity. Looking back at my time here, starting from volunteering without cause, feeling miserable, and now my heart being filled with joy, the 10 years I've spent here was never a waste of time.

Last Feburary, I was made the director here, which pretty much places me as #2 guy here, right after the Pastor. I still have a long way to go in being an effective leader, and I make mistakes all the time, but that's okay with me; Because I know God will guide me, empower me, and tell me exactly what I need to do. I do not feel any burden from tasks and responsibilities as the director; In fact, I feel so happy that I could serve more. Now I pray that more individuals with intellectual disabilities can come to this space, where they feel loved and supported, and accept Jesus in their hearts.

I want to make it clear that I am not here to brag about the 10 years; I also have no idea how long I will be doing this; I just want to thank god for allowing me to serve for the past 10 years, and will keep going forward with humility and humbleness, until he tells me to stop.

Hi everyone,  
I got tired of searching for independent/hipster coffee on Google Maps or Yelp and constantly running into Starbucks and big chains. So I put together something simple — a specialty coffee search with a growing database of independent coffee shops.

Right now, it's mostly focused on SoCal, but I’m working on expanding to more cities. I'm also planning to add more features, like letting coffee enthusiasts highlight what each coffee shop is known for (e.g., specific brewing methods, signature lattes, etc.).

Check it out — would love any feedback! Also, I couldn’t find a better name for it, haha.

1j8kcx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1j8kcx7/coffee_heart_health_does_your_daily_cup_help_or/,Coffee & Heart Health: Does Your Daily Cup Help or Harm?,"Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide. Many people rely on their daily cup to kick-start their day, boost energy, and improve focus. But when it comes to heart health, opinions are divided. Some studies suggest that coffee has protective effects on the heart, while others warn about potential risks. So, does your daily cup help or harm your heart? Let's explore the scientific evidence, expert opinions, and real-life experiences to uncover the truth.

 

# The Link Between Coffee and Heart Health

Research over the past few decades has shown that coffee has both positive and negative effects on the heart. The impact largely depends on factors such as the amount consumed, individual health conditions, and the type of coffee you drink.

# Positive Effects of Coffee on Heart Health

1.      **Rich in Antioxidants**  
Coffee is packed with antioxidants, such as chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which help fight inflammation and protect the heart from oxidative stress.

2.      **May Lower the Risk of Heart Disease**  
Studies have shown that moderate coffee consumption (3-5 cups per day) is linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke and coronary artery disease. According to a study published in the *European Journal of Preventive Cardiology*, people who drink coffee regularly have a lower risk of heart failure and arrhythmias.

3.      **Improves Blood Vessel Function**  
Research suggests that coffee may enhance the function of blood vessels by promoting better circulation and reducing arterial stiffness, which can lower the risk of high blood pressure.

4.      **Boosts Metabolism and Fat Burning**  
Coffee stimulates metabolism, helping the body burn fat more efficiently. Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for heart health, as obesity increases the risk of hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease.

5.      **Potential to Reduce Inflammation**  
Chronic inflammation is a major contributor to heart disease. The anti-inflammatory properties of coffee may help reduce markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP).

# Potential Risks of Coffee for Heart Health

1.      **May Increase Blood Pressure**  
While moderate coffee consumption is generally safe, excessive intake (more than 6 cups per day) may lead to temporary spikes in blood pressure, especially in individuals who are sensitive to caffeine.

2.      **Heart Palpitations and Arrhythmias**  
Some people experience irregular heartbeats or palpitations after consuming coffee, particularly those with existing heart conditions. If you are prone to arrhythmias, it's best to monitor your coffee intake and consult a doctor.

3.      **Can Raise Cholesterol Levels (Depending on Brewing Method)**  
Unfiltered coffee, such as French press or espresso, contains cafestol, a compound that can raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. If you have high cholesterol, switching to filtered coffee may be a better option.

 

# Expert Opinions on Coffee and Heart Health

To gain more insights, we interviewed coffee experts and cardiologists about how coffee affects heart health.

# Dr. Emily Carter, Cardiologist at Heart Health Institute:

*""Moderate coffee consumption is generally safe and may even offer cardiovascular benefits. However, people with existing heart conditions should monitor their caffeine intake and avoid high-caffeine beverages.""*

# John Matthews, Coffee Scientist & Researcher:

*""The key is moderation. While coffee contains powerful antioxidants that benefit heart health, excessive intake can have negative effects, particularly for those sensitive to caffeine.""*

# Sarah Thompson, Nutritionist & Health Coach:

*""Coffee can be part of a heart-healthy diet if consumed in moderation. Pairing coffee with a balanced diet, exercise, and stress management is crucial for long-term heart health.""*

 

# Real-Life Experiences: How Coffee Affects Different People

We asked coffee lovers in the [**gomehedi.com**](http://gomehedi.com) community about their experiences with coffee and heart health.

# Michael, 45, Fitness Enthusiast:

*""I drink 2-3 cups of black coffee daily, and it helps me stay active. I recently had my cholesterol checked, and everything looks great. I believe coffee, combined with a healthy diet, supports my heart health.""*

# Lisa, 38, Office Worker:

*""I love coffee, but I noticed that when I drink too much, my heart starts racing. I’ve learned to stick to one cup in the morning and opt for decaf in the afternoon.""*

# James, 50, Diagnosed with High Blood Pressure:

*""After my doctor advised me to cut back on caffeine, I switched to half-caf coffee. My blood pressure readings have improved, and I still get to enjoy my morning ritual.""*

 

# How to Make Your Coffee Heart-Healthy

1.      **Limit Sugar and Cream**  
Too much sugar and high-fat dairy can contribute to weight gain and heart problems. Use natural sweeteners or drink black coffee.

2.      **Choose the Right Coffee**  
Opt for organic, high-quality coffee to avoid harmful pesticides and additives.

3.      **Watch Your Caffeine Intake**  
Stick to moderate consumption (3-5 cups per day) and consider decaf if you are sensitive to caffeine.

4.      **Pair Coffee with a Healthy Lifestyle**  
Drinking coffee alone won’t guarantee a healthy heart. Exercise, eat nutritious foods, and manage stress for the best results.

5.      **Monitor Your Health**  
Pay attention to how coffee affects your body. If you notice heart palpitations or blood pressure changes, adjust your intake accordingly.

 

# Final Verdict: Does Coffee Help or Harm Your Heart?

The answer depends on how much you drink and your individual health condition. For most people, **moderate coffee consumption offers heart-protective benefits**, thanks to its antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. However, excessive intake can lead to issues like high blood pressure, palpitations, and cholesterol concerns.

The key takeaway? **Enjoy your coffee in moderation, choose healthier brewing methods, and pair it with a heart-healthy lifestyle.**
