1ky0dwm,https://i.redd.it/cowm5kmd0n3f1.jpeg,Nanoq / Polar Bear spotted in Scoresbysund in April 2025 [OC],"I have been going to Greenland for nearly ten years and this was my 10th trip. In all the travels to every corner of the vast country, I had never been in the right place at the right time to see a bear, let alone have my equipment ready to capture some images. This polar bear was seen at the end of April 2025. 

I normally shoot icebergs and landscapes, hence the username. I only spend time in remote parts of Greenland like this area, Ittoqqortoormiit or Scoresbysund. It's the world's largest fjord system and the only place in Greenland where the 350 residents of the town routinely coexist with bears. They also have to survive on the harvest of a small quota of bears every year. Full disclosure. But after the quota is reached, the bears are everywhere. This was such an occasion last month. We saw three bears this day. A lone one and two younger ones near each other - likely 2-year-olds that just left their mother.

The luggage limit is so low that I did not bring my good equipment with me. I have never gotten any passable wildlife in the 20 years I've been a photographer. Just a beat up Fujifilm X-T3 (that was stolen in Iceland later - long story) and the 70-300 with a broken 2x teleconverter (also stolen). It's the only camera I have without a grip so it definitely kept the weight down. I did not plan to shoot wildlife at all this trip because our focus was dogsledding and experiencing traditions. All of my batteries had died because the cold weather was so brutal. My rear lens cap would also not come off until we had to use a tool to pop it off. I was so nervous that the batteries would fail but somehow the stars aligned and I was able to spray and pray to get some of these.

I had inspiration from the most well known wildlife photographer in Greenland. His book was on the coffee table so I showed my guide the kind of images I wanted to capture. I did not know that wildlife photography involved having the image in mind from the outset. I waited patiently while the bear swam and turned off my camera to preserve the battery. But when it started to climb out, I was ready and it was the most fulfilling day in my photographic career in a long time.",1,1748488052.0,greenland,0,1.0,False

1ky0bx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1ky0bx8/what_allergensensitivity_might_keto_be/,What allergen/sensitivity might keto be eliminating for me?,"I used to get so many painful mouth sores, but they completely stopped when I started a keto diet. Any time I go off the diet they immediately come back. I’m thinking there must be a specific allergy or sensitivity that I’m unintentionally eliminating by doing a keto diet. Anyone have ideas of what I might look out for while trying to figure this out?

I’m still drinking coffee, and eating spicy buffalo chicken, plus way more nuts, (dark) chocolate and salty foods than when I’m not eating keto. So I’m pretty sure it’s none of those common causes of general mouth sores. 

Gluten comes up as a possibility, but while I’m definitely eating way *less* gluten, I doubt I am eliminating it fully as I’ll still eat low carb tortillas, soy sauce and whatever else I’m sure gluten hides in. Could simply reducing gluten eliminate symptoms like this or would it need to be total elimination? (Also of note, my son has a very mild wheat allergy, plus some other food allergies, so genetics may be at play??)

Recently it’s mainly just been morning diarrhea (at least 2 loose bowel movements before going to work) Occasionally a loose stool in the evening. Generally my gut just feels like shit until lunch and then gets better in the afternoons but doesn’t really feel calm ever. It seems like I have a ton of trapped gas because I just rarely pass gas (fart) anymore. It’s either I have diarrhea or it stays inside. If I do it’s not very relieving, and is silent or very quiet. Usually doesn’t smell either. 

I’ve experimented with different kinds of probiotics in the past year and haven’t really found one that works great but I do keep experimenting with new ones because it does help with the amount of times I get the urge. It used to be about 6-10 times now it’s 2-4. Right now I’m using align 24/7 digestive support. 

I recently started taking a multi vitamin (43 days ago), cut out coffee and caffeine in general (24 days ago) and started taking 1 500mg tablet of psyllium husk (13 days ago). I take all of these at night before I go to bed. Even more recently I started taking 1 tablet of NOW super digestive enzymes with lunch and dinner (6 days ago)

The first 5 days of taking the psyllium husk I felt like a new person. I was having 1-2 almost perfect bowel movements a day but then my symptoms came back again after about 5 days.

I realize the dose of these supplements are very low but I read that with fiber you should gradually work your way up. I’m wondering what works best for you all. When should I take them, and how “slow” should I be ramping up my dosages? Also if you have any questions for me I am happy to answer!

1ky0ab8,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravel/comments/1ky0ab8/thanks_for_the_help/,Thanks for the help!,"This group was super helpful!  I just returned from 9 days in Scotland (from USA) and it was fantastic. 

My takeaways, for anyone out there following after me: 
1) These were the kindest, friendliest people I’ve ever met worldwide.  
2) The A84 turned my hair white.  Dear heavens above, how do Scots drive and stay sane?  Once we got out into the countryside where the roads were a bit wider (or single track), it was much easier.  
3) In a restaurant, you have to explicitly ask to pay the check.  If you simply say, “we’re all set” or “no, thank you, nothing more,” the servers might pointedly ignore you for as long as you care to sit there.  That was a funny game of chicken until we figured it out. 
4) We were cashless the whole time except for one public toilet in Oban which wanted 50p.  But the distillery gift shop had a lovely restroom for free. 
5) Opening hours for shops and restaurants are shorter than Americans are accustomed to.  Don’t expect anything (even coffee shops) to be open very early.  
6) Speaking of early things, we had great success by getting on the road very early.  The traffic, even just “normal” local traffic on any size road, really added to the overall stress as the day went on.
7) For heaven’s sake, walk a couple of blocks off the high street of the towns and cities, especially Edinburgh.  The Royal Mile felt like Disney/Universal but without the cool roller coasters or efficient crowd management.  Find a local pub and a little guesthouse in a smaller town and you’ll enjoy the hell out of it. 
8) This was one of the best trips of my whole life.  Thank you, Scotland, for the gorgeous scenery, friendly people, fascinating history, delicious food, and all-around good time.

1ky06ue,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ky06ue,Some bakery and coffee shop reviews from a recent trip,"1. Funny Face Bakery (Seaport) - We walked past this random place and were lured in by the smell. The chocolate chip cookie was surprisingly good if you like that kind of thing (large with a gooey interior and crisp exterior). 4/5
2. Supermoon bakehouse - Walking into this place, we were surprised by its minimalist layout/design. We went here after dinner so basically everything was sold out except ice cream, gelato, and a couple cruffins. We got the ube/pandan ice cream sandwich and the ferrero rocher cruffin. The ice cream sandwich was great! The ice cream itself was sorta salty in a wonderful way and seemed to contain pieces of something, maybe toffee. The cake part of the sandwich was soft and moist. We didn’t enjoy the cruffin much though. The filling was mid and the croissant was good from a technical standpoint, but it wasn’t very “moreish” (as the British would say). We each had a couple bites and then put it away and never finished it. 4/5
3. Sey Coffee - My bf got the Colombian drip coffee which was $6. He found it very good indeed. But it was a large quantity of coffee (I guess that’s typically a good thing though). 4.5/5
4. Radio Bakery - I’d decided prior to this trip that I definitely wasn’t going to go here. I’d heard about the hour-long lines. But we were visiting the Brooklyn Botanic Garden anyways…and we were hungry. So we figured we’d swing by their Prospect Park location and see how long of a wait they had. This was at around 1:30pm on a Sunday. The line was quite short, maybe 5-10 minutes? Most things were sold out, of course. But we were able to get the matcha mango morning bun, chocolate chip cookie, and a tofu sandwich. 2 of the 3 were good. The tofu sandwich was exceedingly delicious, probably in the top three most delicious foods of the trip. Whatever chili oil they use in it is very good. My bf didn’t care so much for the morning bun (he found it “confusing”) but I did enjoy the flavor combination. Very well-made. The chocolate chip cookie, on the other hand…we agreed that they perfectly replicated the taste and texture of a cookie you’d get in the bakery section of a grocery store. I don’t know why they sell such a thing. I’ve made many chocolate chip cookies and never had them taste like they were from a grocery store so this was quite a feat from Radio Bakery. 4/5

Black Fox Coffee (not pictured) - I don’t have a picture but I wanted to note that my bf found this to be very good, perhaps even better than Sey. 5/5



1. Elbow Bread - There was maybe a 10 minute wait on Memorial Day morning. We got the garlic bread bialy, blueberry kolache, and nori chocolate chip cookie. All three were excellent. The blueberries were so flavorful and the nori flavor worked very well in the cookie. Highly recommend. 5/5
2. Roasting Plant Coffee - This place has some cool pneumatic coffee contraption. They have several coffee options and you choose one (my bf got the guatemalan) and then the beans are shot from their receptacle into the grinder and ground up. Unfortunately, bf found the coffee to be kinda bad. 2/5
3. Culture Espresso - This was a great way to end the trip! We’ve been to this place several times before but we’d never tried the corn cookie, only the chocolate chip one. This time, we got both. My bf found the corn cookie, which tastes like a very good sugar cookie with corn, to be even better than the chocolate chip one. Their chocolate chip cookie is kinda similar in structure and texture to the one from funny face bakery, but it tastes even better. Highly recommend. As for the coffee, my bf was disappointed to get cold brew when he asked for iced coffee as he doesn’t typically care for the taste of cold brew. But apparently it was very good cold brew. 5/5",4,1748487451.0,FoodNYC,1,1.0,False

I’m a 20F who attends University. I am very extroverted and it's really easy for me to have conversations with strangers and new people I meet. During my Freshman year, I met a lot of new people and even developed a relationship with a lot of these individuals. We would get coffee, do activities, or even pass by each other on campus. However during the end of my Freshman year, I noticed how these same people that I thought we developed a relationship, would never text me, check on me, or barely hangout with me. However I would go out of my way to ask these individuals to hangout or even check up on them once in a while. Flashback to the beginning of my Sophomore year. I noticed the same pattern and had the realization that these individuals were really not my friends.  Because of that I had to cut off these people which has been a relief, yet has made me feel even lonelier during the school year.

The issue is the parents relax a little too much? I was never really familiar with this until seeing it first hand so wanted to know if I’m crazy or other parents have seen this too in these spaces. I’ve been to all kinds of toddler story times, playgrounds, etc and never encountered it.

The parents just do not watch their kids. The age range is wild too, there are 8 year olds running where 10 month old babies are crawling, and I can’t even tell who are their parents. Last week I pulled a baby out of the ball pit because her brother put her in and she was screaming almost completely covered on her back…even when I picked her up and put her down, parents said nothing? Didn’t even see them. Today a baby crawled and got stuck under a sofa before the mom even noticed.  Some of the parents have multiple kids and I’ve heard them yell at their older children (who literally cannot be older than 10) to watch their younger siblings (which they don’t, they want to play as kids should)…and I’ve overheard them boasting about being chill parents who don’t hover over their kids (kids meaning babies and toddlers under 3)

I get we all like to yap and relax but…my kid is 20 months old and I’ll let her walk off in a safe place but I’m watching and usually following her….questioning if I am just a helicopter parent? Is this just a play room thing?",1,1748486933.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False
1ky00ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ky00ww/the_sound_of_life/,The Sound of Life,"“What is evil?” The question resounded against the walls of the lecture hall

A few students stared at each other, others mumbled off topic.

One student raised his hand. He was pale. Dark wavy hair and dark eyes. 

“Evil is a consensus of ideas about the nature of immorality” he said flatly 

“Evil is subjective, in other words” I stated “and throughout this philosophy course I am going to open your third eyes to its non-existence”

I’m not a skeptic. I thought as class dismissed itself, I’m just trying to explain philosophy.

The boy who answered the question with dark, wavy hair lingered in the hallway. Staring into the classroom almost longingly. 

“Can I help you?” I asked

“Maybe,” he said walking away

The next class filtered in and as we progressed through the initial ideas of nihilism. A student raised his hand. 

It was the same student from the last class. I hesitated, but eventually I motioned to him to go ahead and speak.

“If evil is objective and therefore nonexistent,” he started “does that mean morality is also a farce?”

I paused for a moment at the curious nature of this student. 

“I suppose,” I began slowly “that the concept of evil is the ugly offspring of morality.”

The student beamed.

As the day progressed, I saw the student in almost every lecture. Pretending to leave, but then returning once the bell rang. He must not have wanted to speak face to face. I assumed and shrugged it off. 

It is a strange time for incoming freshman. They are not used to the open minded atmosphere of university and tend to awake with great delusion.

I began to gather up my belongings for the day and exit the rather large lecture hall. Tenure allowed me certain privileges.

“Hey” said a small whisper voice from around the hallway doors

I ignored and continued strolling towards the voice and the exit.

“Please, stop moving” the small voice grew slightly louder

“I’m not sure I have time for this” I said growing disgruntled

There was silence. Finally the voice said,
“I’m curious about death”

I froze. I assumed it must be the new student who attended all my lectures.

“Well, my friend, we all have our interests and it’s nothing to be concerned about-“

“I wanna know how it feels” The voice said

I didn’t move a muscle but felt a twitch in my shoulder. 

“Maybe we could discuss this face to face”

There was silence.

I quickly and quietly moved towards the door at an angle I could see but when I got to my position the student was no longer there.

I made it a point the next day to do roll call with the student that seemed very interested in my lectures.

His name was David Straith. A political science student from the West coast.

I spent the day lecturing, he spent the day listening to my lectures, again,

“There can be no existence of an equal and just consensus of the concept of evil. We all draw the line of true evil differently and those slight variations prove there is no absolute truth.”

I watched the wavy haired student closely.

“You there, where do you draw the line” I asked the student with dark wavy hair, “what is true evil?”

“A life without purpose,” he answered swiftly “a life who does not see its value”

“And for some,” I continued “it is murder…”

The room was silent.

At the end of the day, as I gathered my belongings I noticed a note on my desk and did not see who left it. It read:

*I agree with what you said*
*the values of some remain unchanging*
*while others see the light of truth*

I wondered which student could have left it.

The next day was a break day for me. I kept busy with papers and studying.

That night my phone rang. I do give out my personal number during the first class for any class related questions but I make sure to have my available hours on the same paper.

This was not during them, this call came at 2:07 A.M.

“Hello?” I barely got out before the response

“I know what I have to do to change them,” the voice said 

“Change who?” I asked

“I like when they scream.”

The phone beeped signaling the end of the call.

The next day came swiftly and I was nervous to get back on the saddle. 

The entire day came and went without the appearance of the delusional student.

I sighed relief.

As the evening of lecturing closed and I made my way home I stopped at a quick coffee spot on the way home as per usual.

It was a boutique coffee shop next caddy corner from an abandoned office building.

I walked past the alley of the abandoned building. 

I then heard a familiar whisper,

“Hey”

I followed it down the alley to an open door and went in. No one appeared to be inside and I turned to leave before I heard something distant through the walls. The sound of mourning.

I used to research Sudanese genocides and the sound of wailing instantly caught my ears. I followed it.

On the top floor of this building the sound was clear. I started to run fearing the worst and tripped over a body with its entrails strewn about.

“I got carried away” the voice said

I looked up to see the blood matted hair of the dark wavy student.

He helped me up.

“Come look though. I'm doing what you and I talked about”

Inside the room was an unconscious, bloody student I recognized from class.

“There is no evil” David Straith said “I know you see that”

What I was seeing were stars. The immediate urge to vomit almost betrayed me. 

“Yes, yes” I said trying to remain calm 

“I feel different” David Straith said “I’m proud now”

His beaming smile made me almost roll over right then and there.

“I try not to cut as much off cuz’ I like the sound of life” David Straith stated

I started to move backward slowly, calculating my chances of escape.

“She’s like a newborn baby, full of life” as he bent down to kiss her forehead, I bolted

Blurry eyes running. The hardest I ever have. Down stairs and over desks.

Once outside I ran to the coffee shop and phoned the police.

They still haven’t caught him.

Last election I worked on a local campaign where the ""good guys"" were outspent by the ""bad guys"" several times over. The bad guys still lost 30% to 70%, because their main proponents were not well liked and were very fake/phony (think high school mean girls acting ""nice""), their campaign materials were printed out of town, their campaign workers were from out of town, and they didn't have authentic connections to people.  

Meanwhile, our side was all local, we hand made a lot of our campaign materials (RIP my printer), and we got out and talked to people, remembered their names and the issues they were worried about, and explained stuff to them patiently and in-depth on an individual level if that's what it took. If somebody asked me about my campaign button while I was in a coffee shop, I stopped and answered their questions for as long as I could,  even if it meant my latte got cold. We talked to our family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers.  

Be ready with information and facts about our Great Khan. Be ready to explain your reasons for supporting JB. Be ready to answer people's questions. He's a billionaire, but he wants to tax billionaires! He even spent a bunch of his own money trying to tax Illinois billionaires! He inherited his wealth, but both his parents died before he was an adult and his mom was an alcoholic (relatable!) The tax break on the toilet-less mansion was legal, but it's messed up that tax loophole exists in the first place, and he paid the taxes anyways. He took action to prevent book bans in Illinois, to protect abortion rights in Illinois, and protect trans people in Illinois.  

Now, it helped that our opposition's main guy was almost cartoonishly evil, and many of his campaign staff had obvious disdain for the voters, thinking everyone was too dumb to notice the campaign doing shady shit. That's an important point here - don't condescend to your audience. Don't call them illiterate dumbfucks. Don't blame them for the last election's results. Seriously, DO NOT BLAME THEM for the last election's results. If somebody tells you they didn't expect the leopards to eat their face, grimace slightly and reply that we were *all* lied to*. Commiserate.  

We also memed the heck out of our campaign. Funny memes with the bad guy's face superimposed over 80s movie villains. Serious memes with statistical breakdowns and a catchy hashtag. Info-heavy memes. Easy to understand memes for our moms to Like And Share. Friendly memes, safe memes, snarky memes. Something for everyone. Pritzker Pals are already doing a pretty good job on memes, so share them with your relatives on Facebook. Make some memes your Aunt Karen can understand. Get the name recognition out there. Get the Khan's words of wisdom out there.  

Authentic connections are what people need, not influencers and sponsored content.  

* we were all lied to, but some of us saw the lies for what they were as soon as they were spoken, and some didn't and still don't. Try not to gloat about it.",12,1748486911.0,PritzkerPosting,4,0.93,False

This journey was full of self doubt and constant frustration because my scores were not increasing, used to cry every alternate day, wanted to give up so many times! (I am an IMG from india).

After NBME 31 felt confident, but for some reason could not study for the last 3 days, and the night before exam, i was extremely nervous, took a zolpidem at 10, felt asleep, woke up at 12:30. Had a fever, took a Dolo, tried to get some sleep but could not. Got out of bed at 5ish, had a cup of coffee, went for a morning walk with my mother who kept telling me ""you,ve studied hard, trust your prep, have some confidence"". 

Exam day - Marked 15-20 questions in the first block, almost ran out of time, took a 5 min break, told myself i am not gonna give up. took a break after every block, felt tired and sleepy after 4th block, had a coffee. Finished the exam, went down, both my parents were waiting for me, got in the car and cried my eyes out. Spent 3 weeks thinking about other options.

1kxzzz4,https://walrod.substack.com/p/ulysses-at-100,Ulysses at 100: Visiting Joyce's Dublin in 2022,"Like Odysseus himself, *Ulysses* (1922) has come home after a long exile. Its author James Joyce never did. Born in 1882 in Dublin, then part of the United Kingdom, Joyce left for continental Europe in 1904 and returned once, briefly, in 1909. “I will tell you what I will do,” Joyce’s alter ego Stephen Dedalus says in *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* (1916),

>

Living and writing in Trieste, Paris, Rome and Zurich, where he is buried, Joyce never set foot in the modern Republic of Ireland, founded as the Irish Free State in 1922. Thus both Joyceans and the Irish nation as a whole celebrate an important centennial this year. The first great retelling/creative reinterpretation of Homer’s *Odyssey*, Virgil’s *Aeneid*, was commissioned by the emperor Augustus as a national epic for the then-new Roman Empire, a mythic origin of both the city of Rome and the Julio-Claudian dynasty. *Ulysses*, released the same year as the founding of modern Ireland, has become a kind of national epic in its own way.

Joyce’s work sparked controversy in his home country since the beginning of his career. He wrote the short stories collected in *Dubliners* between 1904 and 1907 but could not find a willing Irish publisher; the book was finally published by London-based Grant Richards in 1914.

*Ulysses*, serialized in magazines between 1918 and 1920 and first published as a novel by Sylvia Beach’s Shakespeare and Company in 1922, was banned in the United States until 1934 and in the United Kingdom until 1936. Deciding *United States v. One Book Called Ulysses*, district Judge John M. Woolsey read the entire novel — 1,088 pages in a modern Oxford University Press edition — and [concluded](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/5/182/2250768/) that *Ulysses* was not pornography but instead an “honest effort to show exactly how the minds of his characters operate.” Joyce’s use of ‘dirty’ words, he argues, reflects a commitment to realism which encompasses the “preoccupation with sex in the thoughts of his characters,” not an appeal to readers’ prurient interests. “*Ulysses* may therefore be admitted into the United States,” as Judge Woolsey famously ends his decision.

In Ireland, however, the novel attracted the ire of the ‘Committee on Evil Literature’ whose agitation led to the creation of the Censorship of Publications Board in 1929; key member William Magennis argued that Ireland needed to protect its youth from “the debasing influences of evil literature” such as *Ulysses*, which he once described as “moral filth.” (Magennis, who taught at University College Dublin while Joyce was a student, is actually mentioned in the novel’s 7th chapter, “Aeolus.” Struggling young lawyer J.J. O’Molloy tells struggling young writer Stephen Dedalus that “Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you,” hinting that Dedalus’ own poetry may be attracting unwanted attention from censors-to-be.)

“The book was simply kept out of the country,” Liz Evers writes in the [*Dictionary of Irish Biography*](https://www.dib.ie/blog/irelands-banned-authors-dib). “It was neither imported nor printed here and thus was not widely available in the country until the 1960s.” While *Ulysses* the novel became available in the sixties, Irish audiences could not see the Oscar-nominated 1967 film adaptation until 2001, when the government finally lifted a 33-year-long ban.

Ireland has embraced Joyce decades after his death, not least because Joycean Dublin has taken its place as a major tourist attraction alongside the Guiness Storehouse and the Book of Kells. Before the switch to the Euro, for instance, Joyce’s portrait adorned the Irish ten pound note. Bloomsday, the celebration of the single fictional day — June 16th, 1904 — chronicled in *Ulysses* has become a multi-day, citywide festival in Dublin involving retracing the steps of the novel’s characters, dressing up in period clothing, reciting passages of Joyce’s prose and consuming food and drink mentioned in the novel. In the words of the Visit Ireland website’s [2022 Bloomsday Guide](https://www.visitdublin.com/guides/bloomsday-guide), “there’s a dizzying array of events both free and ticketed, and something to suit everyone from the literary aficionado to Joycean newbies.”

In addition to the James Joyce Centre and James Joyce Museum (two separate institutions), a variety of Dublin cultural spots celebrated the 100th anniversary of Ulysses, including the National Gallery of Ireland, The Abbey Theatre and the Museum of Literature Ireland. During my stay I visited Lincoln’s Inn pub, which celebrates its historical connection to the author with three exclusive Joycean beers, including Bloomsday Lager and Joyce’s Stout, and Davy Byrne’s pub, which was visited by fictional protagonist Leopold Bloom in *Ulysses* and still serves the lunch he ordered: a gorgonzola sandwich. (Of course I ordered it.) One can buy copies of Joyce’s books, Joyce greeting cards, coffee mugs, 100th anniversary pins, a variety of t-shirts and even a handmade “[James Joyce Decoration](https://shop.nationalgallery.ie/products/james-joyce-decoration?_pos=1&_sid=46f1b7f37&_ss=r),” or stuffed doll. Like Elvis, Joyce has inspired a cohort of impersonators, who don copies of his hat, glasses, eyepatch and walking stick every Bloomsday.

I appreciate the small things in life, and one of them is food, as evidenced by my daily morning weigh-in. With that being said, I love coffee, hot sauce, seasonings, and salt and having them at my fingertips. Since I'm heading on an adventure soon, I need to make a small seasoning kit to spice up the airport and airplane food. 

The question now begins: how much do I bring with me? The answer is to grab a small bag and think to yourself, ""This will work."" AKA Giving yourself a space limit to the things you want to bring by limiting yourself to a limited space.

Here's my spice kit: instant coffee, various kinds of hot sauce, and a tiny salt (real salt) and pepper shaker.

he's kind, charismatic, and also christian (but his practice is lacking) and clearly has an interest in me and i believe i feel the same. i can't stop thinking about him and i believe we went on our first date last night. we were both at uni late and decided to go out for dinner. we went to a secondary location from the school, he drove and paid, drove me to the train station and we stayed in his car for an hour because we missed my train and it was freezing outside.

he has had many experiences with relationships, and for some reason i find that so appealing, as well as his experience in his work field. he's in the army and also has worked with exactly what i want as a career.

but i'm scared. i've been begging and praying to God to give me a sign if he's meant to be in my life; either husband or learning experience, as i have NEVER been in a relationship before or have had a crush like this.

he's offering a second dinner, or in general a second catch up like coffee before class. but even if we get into a relationship i don't think it will work out. i'm moving universities at the end of this semester, he lives three hours away from me (if he's looking after his brother. he lives an hour from me if he's living on campus) and works two jobs part time.

i don't even know if i love him, but we work so well together. we have so much in common, but then again it could just be the honeymoon friend phase. i just have a lot of overwhelming thoughts and anxiety but i'm wondering... should i continue? i'm so scared, like so extremely scared. of getting hurt, of embarrassing myself. i've never dated, i've never been in a relationship, i've never had a mutual crush with someone before. but it's so clear that something could happen and i guess i just don't know what to do.

additionally, many are concerned about the age gap. what 22 year old guy do you usually hear taking out an 18 year old girl for dinner and paying, even platonically? i genuinely do know i am mature for my age, many of my mid-twenties and even thirties friends are always confused about my age because i've been through so much and have a lot of spiritual wisdom, more than they do. i am blessed with this knowledge and my maturity from God, but still.. the numbers are off-putting. i'm not very concerned but when looking back in retrospect, it does become concerning.

We have worked tougher for about a little over a year on the same team, but she does not report to me, although I’m in a more senior role. 

We live in different countries though I feel we communicate constantly - over Zoom, Slack and WhatsApp.

We recently had our company meetings at headquarters. It’s the second time we’ve been together in person. She sat next to me almost every meal, event, bar outing. We talked and laughed constantly. I feel such a connection with her, unlike I’ve felt before. 

We were talking one day and I came to learn she’s thinking about leaving. I was crushed and I told her so. We had a really heartfelt conversation and I told her I hope she sticks around and this would suck if it were the last time we were together in person. She seemed a bit emotional in the discussion too. We went on to have a fun night, the last one before we went home. 

I am not suave, I could not think of a way to ask her back to my room. I’m also not so forward, and also feel there is a risk of upsetting her, losing our friendship, or risking my job, if I were to invite her to my room. 

That night we were texting. I said how much fun I have with her; she said “me too”. And I said “there is more I’d like to say but it’s late…” but I didn’t get an answer. 

The next day the two of us plus two other coworkers traveled the airport together. We sat having coffee before each of our respective flights. She was the first to go, and gave our two coworkers hugs, then me. She walked away, then turned back and gave me another hug and said quietly “I love you”

I was dumbstruck. I couldn’t speak. She walked away and I just stared. 

A few minutes later I went over to her gate, found her and gave her another hug. I lingered a bit, and then said “let’s talk when you get home.” 

I was on such a high. But then I started thinking - what if she meant just as friends? 

She hasn’t given me any crystal clear messages or hints like “I want you” but I’m not sure if it’s a cultural thing, if she’s playing hard to get or what. I feel like it’s a bit of mixed signals, and when she said “I love you” oh man did that mess me up. 

We have continued talking since we both returned home, basically every day on WhatsApp. She asked if I’d come visit, but made it sound like she wanted time to visit the rest of our coworkers at that office too. 

I don’t know how to interpret this, and I’m not sure of a good way to broach the subject without making her feel uncomfortable or risking our friendship (not to mention risking my job if I’m completely wrong). Any advice on how to address it with her? 

TLDR; I feel a strong connection with my coworker but I’m not sure if I’m overblowing things or, if I’m right, how to talk to her about it? ",1,1748485596.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

I recently rented a 2022 Mazda Miata ND RF and absolutely loved the drive but ran into some fitment issues due to my height (6’3”, 195 lbs). I was able to make the stock seat work *just* enough for normal street driving but when I hit the canyons, my shins started digging into the dash and more critically, the rearview mirror blocked a huge portion of my forward-right visibility. I had to duck to see around it which feels unsafe in tight turns.

I believe an aftermarket seat mounted lower (e.g., Bride, Sparco, or custom rails) could solve the problem but before I commit to buying a used Miata and spending the money on mods, I’d really appreciate the chance to **sit in (or take a short ride in)** an ND RF that’s already been set up this way.

**Anyone in the Los Angeles or San Francisco area** with a low-mounted aftermarket seat in their ND RF willing to let me check out the setup? I’ll bring coffee, beer, or lunch as a thank you, whatever your style.

We agreed on setting the bar low and seeing what comes out of our relationship. We didn't really see each other often do to his work schedule, but we would still text frequently mostly every day. A traumatic family event occurred and he took time off to be with his family. His family lives in the next state over and he left for a month and then came back down when things calmed down to sort stuff out. He saw me the first night he got back and for the next 2 1/2weeks we hung out every day almost. It wasn't about abt the sex anymore it was just about being with each other. He then went back up to be with his family, but came down again for a friends party. He spent 5 days here and we hung out 4 of those 5 days. I texted him last night after he hung out and I asked him ""do you think this is all this is ever gonna be? im not saying rn cause I don't think its a good time for either of us."" and he replied with ""I think that every relationship changed over time. Especially as we both kinda go though some big life changes. Do you feel okay with where we are at?"" I told him that I felt okay with where we are at I just felt uncertain at times and we talked about it a bit more and went to bed. This morning we got coffee and said goodbye for the last time before he spends the remainder of his time off with his family. I think I am fine with how things are I just feel like because there isn't a label it could just disappear at any second. He shows up consistently for me and doesn't expect anything from me. I've also never had a relationship like this before so it's new for me. We have spent so much time tg recently I really have had time to fully see what I want and thats him. I know he's going through a lot with his family, mental health struggles, and work, but it's hard sometimes. I dont even know what im saying at this point.",1,1748485409.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

That night I had to tell my mom and younger brother. The next day I received a call from the coroner of the county to give me information. They told me he had been there for 6-8 weeks in his apt since he died, and was found by a maintenance man posting his second late rent notice. I authorized an autopsy and started making arrangements to travel to that county to sign for his belongings and begin cleaning out his apartment. Cleaning out the apartment was the most traumatic thing I have ever done, he had just moved in to this apartment and didn’t even unpack anything. The entire apartment looked like wild dogs had been living there using the whole place as a toilet and ordering ipa six packs on DoorDash. Apparently it is known as coffee ground emesis and is a symptom of end stage alcoholism. He didn’t ever reach out for help from anyone. He was going through tons of Valium from a dark web source and the spot where he was found in his apartment has basically been dissolved from where he laid on it.

1kxzigf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kxzigf/husband_34m_says_ive_32f_changed_and_thats_a/,Husband (34m) says I’ve (32f) changed and that’s a problem.,"TL;DR:
OP (32F) has been married to her husband (34M) for 7 years, together for 10. After years of dismissing relationship issues as life stress, therapy has helped her recognize emotional abuse and neglect from her husband, who has shown increasing narcissistic behavior since they had children. He criticizes her for “changing” (i.e., becoming a responsible parent), while he avoids parenting responsibilities, smokes weed, and contributes little at home. She’s overwhelmed as a stay-at-home mom to three kids (with twins on the way), while he’s disengaged and demanding. Attempts at counseling failed, and he’s made threats when she tried to leave. Despite some good moments as a father, he refuses to acknowledge his role in their issues, leaving her torn and emotionally exhausted.————————-

Husband (34M) and myself (32F) have been together 10 years, married 7 years. The past couple years have been rough, but we’ve weathered through it….more like I’ve just ignored it thinking it was ‘just the season of life’ we were in and a series of misfortunes that had caused the rough patches. The past couple months I’ve been doing weekly therapy, which has made me realize husband is emotionally abusive, and I’m too much of a pushover to address the behaviour. He has a lot of narcissistic tendencies that didn’t start showing up until we started having kids 6 years ago. I’ve gotten up the nerve a couple times to probe deeper into little things my husband has said to me, and it’s basically come to light that since having kids I’ve changed too much for him and he doesn’t consider me fun anymore. 
When I probed deeper on that, he said because I don’t smoke weed all day everyday anymore. ( because we have 3 young children and I’m currently pregnant again with twins ) I don’t view it as changing- more like evolving and you know, becoming a responsible parent. Husband goes to work, comes home smokes weed and cigarettes outside in the garage while scrolling his phone, comes and joins us for dinner MAYBE if I’m lucky we’ll get to watch a tv show together, then he’s back outside until I text him that the kids are ready for bed to which he comes inside and plays with them for 10-20 minutes, leaves me to put them to bed and goes back outside. I’m a stay at home mom and am basically responsible for everything around the house and kids. I RARLEY get time to just scroll on my phone and just chill because there is too much work to be done around the house. I don’t get to sit down until around 10pm- to which he says that’s my own fault because I could just leave ‘all the mess’ until tomorrow and relax- which in reality yeah I could, but then we would have plates and old food sitting out because nobody can clean up after themselves, and it would give me that much more work to do the next day, plus I’m required to make sure not only the kids lunches are made, but his as well and his coffee mugs are hand washed only and placed in the correct spot otherwise I get yelled at. If I do manage to get free time and try to spend it with him, he gets super annoyed at me. He tells me he loves me, but his actions have shown me otherwise. I really feel like he just wanted a family because ‘that’s what a man’s supposed to do’ and he’s not up for the actual responsibility of it. He’d be happier getting ‘a newer model’ who hasn’t been ‘damaged’ by childbirth, who isn’t too tired, who can keep the house clean because there isn’t a bunch of kids running around, who has no problem being intimate all the time. ( currently we have no intimacy. It’s hard to get over the fact I feel like an object from the way I’ve been treated like one, plus all he ever does is expect me to be foaming at the mouth for him and instantly ready to go. ) 
I’ve put so much time and effort into this relationship and honestly just want to feel like I felt in the first 4-5 years before kids again where he treated me like I was his everything. 
Yes, we’ve tried couples counselling ( one time ) he’ll never do it again. Yes, I’ve tried leaving with the kids and taking a break and that resulted in one week of good behaviour and him threatening to end himself if I ever did it again. I’ve thought of leaving for good, but he promised to destroy me if I ever did and honestly I wouldn’t put it past him to do everything in his power to ruin my life or steal the kids and run. 
My therapist eludes to ‘if he doesn’t want to see himself as a problem, or a part of that problem and has no desire to improve himself or fix himself than what’s the point in staying?’ But I mean, when he does spend time with the kids he’s a great dad and they would be absolutely crushed if we divorced. I’m at a loss on how to verbalized or show him that maybe it’s not the fact I changed, but maybe it’s the fact he hasn’t that’s caused us to become stagnant.

I recently reconnected with someone I dated 6 years ago that I was very smitten with, but the timing was off as I was moving abroad and it fizzled out because of that. So I always thought about what could have been.

So I recently reach out as we both moved to the same city and I had figured out he is recently out of a long term relationship. Side note, when I reached out he did not know I knew this. So we meet up and he told me he ended things in March (said my timing is crazy as he is recently single…. Sir I knew that already🤭😆).

We’ve hung out 3 times in the past month but no explicit dates… just coffees and happy hour. He has been busy with his PhD studies so I haven’t been pressing to hang out much as I understand it’s demanding at the moment. 

When we do hang out, he is borderline flirty (gives multiple compliments on my physical features, mentions how we get along so well, etc) but nothing explicit to indicate he’s 100% interested. Which I understand, he is newly single. He does seem generally happy with his decision to be single again, and while I haven’t pressed for details about the breakup, he gives me the impression that that was that and he is going no contact.

Sooooooo, my question is, how long did it take you to get over a LTR? I am excited at the prospect of continuing to get to know this version of him, but don’t want to be delusional in thinking he’s ready to explore anything yet. Totally fine. Just want to strike a balance and be realistic about timing :)

It doesn’t matter if you took my past traumas or said hurtful things. From the text to your mom, to how things played out in court, to how I acted at dinner before everything came crashing down, all those moments were unacceptable and I have no one to blame but myself. You don’t deserve to be treated that way, especially not when you were already trying to do something I had asked of you. I’m so sorry. 

Feeling misunderstood and knowing my intentions in those moments didn’t always match the way I acted doesn't excuse anything. I understand now that even if something was “just a moment” to me, those moments added up and hurt you deeply because I feel the same way. We both played a part, and I take full responsibility for hurting you. 

To answer your questions, you made me so incredibly happy! The happiest I have ever been in my life and I mean that. My inner child lit up when our love flourished and that part is undeniable. I think that’s the reason why I felt like I could share my past traumas with you because I felt like you would understand. I know we fought more towards the end, mostly because I thought we were both taking our clean slate seriously.. that truth and honesty would be what held us together. But I focused too much on that, and lost track of how to actually show love and support. 

I never ever want to control you. I just wanted the exact same sensitivity and vulnerability you showed with me. I wanted to be on the same page emotionally but I realize I was pushing you away instead of understanding. If our paths ever cross, please know that I will never want to control you again. Loving you means all of you and who you are as a person. 

I’m so grateful to have met you. To have made the best love to you that I’ll never ever get to replicate. I’m blessed to have called you princess and be your first choice at one time in your life. I don’t regret meeting you , I only regret the things that made you ultimately want to call it quits. 

You’re right. Your friends probably see me a certain way, and mine likely view you in their own limited perspective. That’s life, but I guess the silver lining in all that is.. only we know what we shared, what we went through, and how much we loved each other. This wasn’t any ordinary love for me. I’m so lucky I had you in my life. Really had you, not just passing through, not just a nice memory. You were the real thing. You are the real thing. No matter what, and how much time passes, I know what we had was ours, and only ours. Thank you for showing me how far true love can go. It wasn’t necessarily the big things, but the everyday stuff. Thank you for the early mornings making coffee for me before work. Thank you for those days I look forward to your delicious cooking after a long days of work. Thank you for making grocery trips a fun activity to do and look forward to. Thank you for always wanting to know about my day and for making a random Tuesday staying in just as fun as going out on a weekend. You made my life feel full, even in the quiet parts. Every time I see something beautiful or hear a song I want to share with you, it’s my way of keeping you here. You're still a part of everything I do.



In the end, I’m not here to change your mind about me. I just hope that one day, we’d both be healed enough to find our way back, with honesty and care, not chaos and fear. I want peace for you. Not chaos. Not drama. Just quiet, safe, freeing peace. I hope one day someone gives that to you, if it’s not me. 

I’ll carry us with me, every step of the way. Until we meet again. I love you forever and always

Well. Guess what. Today I found out she doesn’t even drink coffee. What the 🤬!!!!

All this time she’s been lying to my face. 
This is fraudulent. 
This is betrayal. 

I should have seen the signs man. I should have suspected. She’s lately been getting 4 coffee sends a day, I was already concerned that it’s a high amount of caffeine per day but I thought it’s doable for the human body. This past week she’s been getting 6 coffee sends every day so I had to check if she’s okay with all that caffeine and she admitted she doesn’t drink coffee. Like OMFG. 

I tried to find a way to feel better about this stab to the back. Was she at least drinking something coffee adjacent like tea or a Monster energy drink?? No, no she was not. She drinks water, like some kind of fish. 

I thought she was the one. I’m so fed up. Where are the real dommes who puts a coffee send on their Throne and then actually drinks coffee. Do I keep looking or just give up?

Coffee sends are pretty much part of my sexuality at this point I’m not even sure I can give it up.

IITians, BITSians, DTU, IIM grads — the new elite varnas.

Pedigree is the new currency. Image is the god.
Founders and investors look divine on LinkedIn, but in real life? It’s all optics.

Let’s be honest — even I couldn’t escape this system.

“Shark Tank featured founder” has become a new caste label —
A badge that makes you worth listening to, thanks to Shark Tank India 

Ask yourself — if it wasn’t for Shark Tank or national TV, would you have even cared to listen to me?

Probably not.
Because in this system, unless you have a shiny badge or a spotlight on you, the gates stay closed.

I didn’t want to flaunt the tag — but I had to.
Because like most of us , I come from a middle class family ,average in study , No Ivy league college, neither have a fancy degree nor have a strong network , and from a state like Bihar — which always has to prove it’s not indifferent.

And without that tag? I’d sink further below the surface.

It’s like being on Swiggy or Zomato without offering discounts — no one places the order.

And the investors(not all) ? The so-called visionaries?

Half of them operate on pure FOMO.
One goes into edtech — they all follow.
Then foodtech. Then quick commerce. Now AI. Now coffee.

An investor literally said — “We need a coffee startup in our portfolio.”
Why?
Because someone else has one.
The analyst gets told — “Just find one. Doesn’t matter what.”

Is that what vision looks like now?

Let me tell you — founders aren’t the only ones with FOMO.
Investors have it worse.
And when the money dries up, they call it a “Funding Winter.”

No, it wasn’t a funding winter.
It was a freeze in vision.

Copycat investing. No ground reality. Of course the storm had to come.

Everyone talks about disruption, catogery creation, product market fit.
No one wants to take risks.

You want to play safe?
Start a bank. dont invest in startups.

The caste system never left — it just started speaking English.
The fragrance is still the same.
Only the packaging changed.

1kxz6zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kxz6zf/bingo_review_alex_ada_by_j_luna_and_s_vaughn/,Bingo Review: Alex + Ada by J. Luna and S. Vaughn,"If I had a nickel for every time this month that the villain of my bingo read was Amazon under a slightly different name, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't much, but it's weird that it happened twice. 

Anyway, *Prime*, the company that lurks in the background of Alex + Ada, creates expensive AI models that are so human-like that they are required by law to have a mark that identifies them as androids. Most people cannot afford these models, but our main character, Alex, has a rich grandma who buys him one after seeing him unable to move on from his ex-girlfriend. He soon becomes a little creeped out by Ada the android, and wonders if she can ever be allowed to be her own person. 

For everyone looking for a hard-hitting examination about the ever-thinning line between human and AI in the modern world: this is not it. AMC's *Humans* is a CRIMINALLY underrated TV series that covers that exact topic. And anyone who wants to know how a romantic relationship with an AI built to your needs would hamper your ability to form relationships with other humans, look no farther than 2021's *I'm Your Man*, starring Dan Stevens. And, of course, there's always Asimov.

But for everyone who is a little too skeeved out by the current issues with AI to want to watch/read something hard-hitting, and likes the idea of cozy android fiction, this graphic novel is for you. I intended to read Vol 1 for the *Down with the System* square, but ended up realizing that this would actually complete the, for me, much harder ""Cozy"" square. Our lead character, Alex, is an introvert with a great relationship with his grandmother. He and the Android sleep in separate rooms. They watch movies together. He has friends that are worried for him after the breakup and make him chocolate stout cake. There's a little flying saucer that makes him coffee in the morning. It's cozy.

  
And the art is very clean, full of soft-lines in the real world and sharp edges in the online world. (The representation of chat rooms? VERY fun). It's interesting without seeming cluttered, and I don't think I've ever experienced a better ""tempo"" in a comic book/graphic novel before. There aren't any awkward time jumps or odd ""skimming over"" of stuff that the writer thinks is clearly covered by the art, and the artist clearly thinks is covered by a single line of dialogue, when *it really isn't*. It very much seems like the author and artist were working very closely, and made every single line and panel count. 

I'll mourn when it moves into ""romance"" territory, and I lose the BFFs dynamic (maybe a Vol 2 thing? Vol 3? It's going to happen, clearly) but for now, I finally found a cozy read that I don't DNF. Cheers to softly glowing screens and philly cheesesteaks.

1kxz6h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kxz6h4/best_friend_is_very_judgmental/,Best friend is very judgmental…,"Sorry this is a long rant y’all. 

I (25 F) have recently started to realize that my best friend (22 F) has become very judgmental. She went through a self described “glow up” a year ago. She also got a really incredible corporate job straight after graduating college at 21. I’m incredibly proud of her for her hard work. Unfortunately her (well deserved) confidence has turned into a little bit of a superiority complex. I genuinely think she means well and doesn’t realize she has these beliefs that she projects onto other people. I think because she is successful at a young age she feels safe in her identity when she criticizes other people. She is also insecure at the same time and will compare herself to others in other ways. I’ve recently had to take a little bit of space from her because she Facetimed me last week to complain about a coworker who apparently sucks at his job and nobody likes. I won’t go into details but it sounds like this guy is just struggling a bit and rather than helping him grow they’re all talking mad shit about him behind his back and being mean girls rather than showing grace for him. 

She will sometimes make comments about things as a general sweeping opinion, but these are things that apply to me. I once called her out on it and she backtracked and apologized, but she still continues to make certain comments. She will sometimes start something new and then immediately judge people who don’t do it. Like she started keto and says things like “people don’t need to eat carbs” or “you don’t care about your health if you eat carbs” meanwhile I’m bagel fanatic. She will sometimes also make judgmental comments about something that is objectively false, and will NOT budge on it when challenged gently. 

If I make a small decision for myself that I feel is right, she sometimes has to contradict it. And it’s always a small comment. We were getting coffee and they made my drink iced when it was supposed to be hot, it wasn’t busy so I kindly asked the barista to remake it. She goes “I would have just drank it as is”. I will say something about a certain situation made me uncomfortable, and she’ll say “Oh those types of things don’t bother me”. She’ll judge me for an action that I’ll take even if it’s something small, but then she’ll make a similar decision in a similar scenario. 

She seems to have a lot of really stubborn beliefs about the world that aren’t necessarily true and will judge people from that lense. Things like “you have to go to college to get any sort of good job” or “people who don’t go to the gym are stupid” things like that. It’s always this absolute statement like “Everyone should be on Keto”. “If you don’t have 10,000 saved up by the time you’re 30 you’re a loser.” “Stay at home Mom isn’t a real job”. She’s always offering her opinion on things even if it’s not fully necessary and she just needs to listen, and even if it’s a fact that isn’t true. She will learn something new and talk down to people with that fact, even if it isn’t verified or it doesn’t apply to them. She asked me why I wasn’t 1099 for my job because that’s required for filing in a kind of judgy way, even though in our state it’s ILLEGAL for employees to be 1099 and they must be W-2. 

She will make a comment about me doing something that I’m doing for a reason and say I’m doing it incorrectly. She’ll say “you’re actually supposed to…” when I’m not asking for her opinion or advice on something. She even sometimes teases me for doing something incorrectly that I’ve actually done for a specific reason. It’s almost as if she’s taking very inconspicuous things about me and the way I live my life and twisting them to be something “incorrect” so that she feels better about herself by comparison. 

I am a huge proponent of direct communication, however I’m nervous about how to communicate these things with her given how stubborn she is. Before I realized this was such a pattern, I started to push back against her line of thinking in the most graceful way I knew how. I feel like she’s caught on to me doing this and feels a bit of tension around me. I find it hard to continue validating her in her judgments of others. Some things I won’t even push back on, and other things make me feel disconnect from her and I will. I’ve noticed a lot of her beliefs have to do with productivity, work, anything that requires ACTION. 

My whole shtick is being open minded and compassionate to others. I of course have healthy boundaries and standards, however I’m not seeing the world through one narrow lense and judging people from that perspective. This whole development is really against my values, rubbing me the wrong way and pushing me away a little bit. I do think this stems from personal insecurity and the way she judges herself. I just don’t know how to explain this to her in a mindful way given how firmly she defends her beliefs. 

And to conclude, there are MANY wonderful things about her. She is a good friend in a lot of ways and I do love to spend time with her. I’m not interested in ending the friendship or villainizing her. We’re both young, I think she’s naive and this is her way of coping. I think if she heavily attaches to the fact that she graduated a year early and got a good job straight out of school, she doesn’t have to think about her other insecurities or the ways in which she feels unsure or inadequate. Unfortunately this has started to affect me and my own self image, which I won’t allow to continue.

Wet kisses trace along my back, igniting a fire within me. As he spreads my legs wider, time seems to blur, and before I can register it, he plunges into me once again. I cling desperately to the sand, hoping it will anchor me. I yearn for something to hold onto, to ground myself in this intoxicating moment. Am I losing my mind to these carnal desires? I crave release, yet I also yearn for salvation...”

""CHRISS?""

Ellen's voice pierces through my headphones, jolting me from my reverie. She snatches my phone from my grasp and starts reading aloud while I try to reclaim it.

""Ken, you have to see this! Oh my God!"" she exclaims, beckoning Ken over. They both become engrossed in the explicit scene, reveling in its titillation. I slump into my seat, defeated and hopeless.

Laughter fills the air as they laugh and react to the explicit content. These are my crazy friends, irreplaceable companions who have been with me since sixth grade. They know my highs and lows, some of my secrets, and every intricate detail about me. I can't imagine life without them.

Leaving the court behind, we make our way to calculus class. Little did they know that Dayle Theodore, my secret crush, would be there. From the moment I first laid eyes on him, he captivated me. While everyone knows him, I feel like I know him on a deeper level.

Despite the painful clashes we've had, my heart still longs for him. I know it's foolish, considering the way he insulted and taunted me in front of the entire school. The memory still haunts me, and I blame myself for not standing up to him or escaping his ridicule. I should have run away instead of shedding tears like a helpless child. But even though he's the villain in my story, I can't help but yearn for him. And so, I resort to indulging in erotic novels, where I can at least fantasize about him.

""Have you talked to Max?"" Ken asks as we enter the classroom. Max Norman, my boyfriend, is a great guy—tall, handsome, a soccer player—but my infatuation with Dayle eclipses my thoughts.

""Nope! I'm still mad at him. We were supposed to hang out yesterday, but he bailed, and now I'm paranoid!"" I reply with a tinge of irritation.

""He's genuinely sorry, and I swear he can explain everything—""

""Ken, it won't work this time! Don't defend him just because he's your friend.""

Clearly, Max sent Ken as a messenger, but it's not enough to sway me. Just because they're on the same team doesn't mean I'll accept his apologies so easily.

""Honestly, if you let me, I'll give Max a taste of his own medicine,"" Ellen chimes in, causing me to smile curtly. I don't want to read too much into her words, though sometimes the way she talks about him makes me suspect she likes Max. But for now, I'll dismiss it.

""Whatever, guys. I'm just not in the mood for Max right now,"" I finally express, taking my seat alongside them. Ken is more of a ""flings and nothing more"" kind of guy, similar to Dayle, who is notorious for his player ways and insatiable sexual appetite. I've heard he sleeps with every popular girl without a care, and they willingly oblige. How messed up is that?

I pull out my phone and start mindlessly scrolling through Instagram when boisterous laughter erupts from the entrance. I raise my head and spot Dayle, accompanied by Egan and Steve. These cliques are notorious for using and discarding people. They may not have girlfriends, but they have an endless line of girls and fans to toy with. Being around them means losing your innocence; I bet anyone would break their promises or their mother's trust. I'm certain of it.

""Chriss, seriously, why don't you just go over to him and spill the truth?"" Ellen suggests, bringing me back to reality.

""Why would you say that?"" I coolly respond, rolling my eyes as she predicts my thoughts. I once confided in her about my feelings for Dayle, only to be met with her dismissal. She claimed that every girl at Hemville Senior High likes Dayle. She just doesn't understand, and I'm not surprised she brushed it off.

The sight of Dayle wearing a similar jacket as his friends adds to the ache in my heart. I can't comprehend how one person can be so irresistibly sexy and breathtakingly handsome. His dark, silky hair, tall and well-built physique, sharp nose, and killer jawline make him the epitome of male beauty. You'd think someone with such exquisite features couldn't possibly hurt anyone. And therein lies the problem—I've been one of his targets, invisible in his eyes. He doesn't look at me the way I look at him.

I avert my gaze as the teacher enters the room. Dayle is my ultimate weakness, and it's slowly devouring me.

I waste an hour and thirty minutes on Calculus, but I'd gladly waste it on Dayle instead. He means everything to me. It's not that I don't care for Max, but my feelings for him fall short. Besides, he's always occupied, and I can't stand it. He may try to ward off the attention from other girls, but I fear that one day I might lose him to them, or even worse, to my best friend, Ellen.

I know my attention should be focused elsewhere, but I can't explain this insatiable pull toward Dayle.

# Chapter 2

***Dayle***

As Egan handed me my Exclusive list, my coffee almost splattered on his face. It is not that I didn't like the list but damn, they are major deals. We all had our exclusive lists of girls we wanted to have fun with, especially those who seemed untouchable yet badass. However, I couldn't understand why Egan had included Chrissy, the lamest of them all. He claimed it was payback for last semester when I tricked him into making out with a fat girl who ended up changing schools. Despite my reservations, I knew I had no choice but to oblige.

“Damn, this list is HOT!”

""You bet! We've got from now till the end of the semester to have a blast,"" Egan chuckled.

""I'm telling you, Tasha is mine, and I've got my eyes set on Lauren,"" Steve chimed in.

""Not so fast! Lauren is still on my mind. We haven't done it yet,"" I teased. A week ago, I had a chance with her, but she was furious that I was talking to other girls. Now, to make matters worse, I'm hitting on her best friend, Amber. Tonight, I plan to make it up to Lauren, though she has no idea about my intentions with Amber.

""Didn't you—""

""Relax, Steve! Egan just gave me the virtual list a few hours ago. After tonight, you can have her all to yourself,"" I playfully barked, and we all laughed it off.

""But if she's a virgin, do me a favor and let me have that glory!"" Steve teased.

""We all know she's not a virgin. Didn't she date that Karl guy who graduated?"" I reminded them, and they affirmed it. ""She's definitely not a freshman,"" I added.

""Guys, here comes Amber,"" Egan whispered, and we stretched our necks to catch a glimpse. He was right—she was heading our way.

""Guys, this is my chance!"" I announced, and we performed our signature handshake before I made my move.

I brushed my shoulder against hers, pretending not to notice her approaching as I focused on my phone. Accidentally, I let it slip from my hand, causing it to fall and crack. Of course, it wasn't an actual expensive phone; it was part of the plan to grab Amber's attention. She loved putting up a tough act and was nearly impossible to approach. I had tried talking to her last semester, but she ditched me when she heard rumors about my supposed ex, Molly. Molly and I were not on speaking terms, but that's a story for another time. Right now, all that mattered was Amber.

""Hey, Amber,""

I called out to my prestigious and latest target, the cheerleader of our squad.

""Oh my gosh, Dayle, I crushed your phone. I'm so sorry—"" she began to worry, attempting to pick it up. But I quickly stopped her, playing the nice guy. It was working since she was smiling at me now.

""Don't worry about it, Amber. I'll get another one. Even though I loved this one,"" I said, swiftly picking up the phone and tucking it into my jacket pocket.

""I swear, I'm sorry. It's an iPhone...""

""Don't worry about it, dear. I've got it covered. I hope everything's okay with you though. You seem lost in thought.""

""Oh, er...never mind. I'm just stressed out. That's all!""

""Well, that explains it!"" I replied with a nod.

""It doesn't justify it, though, right?! I'm sorry, Dayle. I have to go right now. I have a Biology class. How about we hang out for lunch tomorrow to make it up to you since you won't let me pay for the damages?"" she suggested, and I silently screamed ""Yes!"" in my head.

""That sounds fair, but I don't want you to feel like you're indebted—""

""I wouldn't feel that way if you let me.,"" she interrupted, taking out a sticky note and grabbing a pen from my pocket. She scribbled her number, then handed it to me. ""Call me!"" she said, flashing a smile before walking away. Once she was out of sight, my mischievous friends cheered me on, punching me roughly. We walked away, glancing back to ensure we were in the clear.

""I never thought she'd be THAT easy. I had my doubts that she'd figure out it's all a—""

""Steve, shut your mouth. Someone might hear!"" I cautioned, and he swallowed the rest of his words.

""Guess what? We're having lunch tomorrow!"" I announced, and they erupted with excitement.

""You're one big trickster!"" Egan exclaimed, running his fingers through his hair. I nudged his arm playfully. We headed towards the basketball court for practice, with someone unexpectedly standing in my way—Lauren. Fuck! I didn't see this coming; maybe she saw me talking to Amber. This dimpled bitch is sneaky.

""Laurie baby!"" I greeted her, and she rolled her eyes, crossing her arms. My friends walked ahead towards the changing room while I stayed back.

""Are you avoiding me, Dayle?""

She was furious, and I rubbed my face, trying to come up with the right words.

""No, honey, I've just been busy. We agreed to meet tonight, remember? It still stands!"" I reassured her, stroking her arm. She rolled her eyes once again, clearly unconvinced. Dang!

""I want you right now!"" she asserted, giving me a determined look, and I knew exactly what she meant.

""Me too, honey, but I have to practice—""

""But I can't wait until tonight. I deserve—""

I didn't let her finish her sentence. I simply grabbed those luscious red lips and kissed her passionately. It was the only way to distract her for now. When our kiss finally broke, she smiled. We were settled.

""I'll see you tonight. I'll come to pick you up!"" I whispered in her ear, making her blush before she left. I lightly slapped her butt, and she winked back at me with a smile. I loved that dimple on her cheek; it was charming, just like she was. I sighed in relief before catching up with my friends.

""What took you so long?"" Egan asked, tying his shoelace on the right leg.

""She wanted to have sex right then and there! I had to pull off a stunt—a French kiss!"" I explained, stripping out of my clothes as they chuckled.

""She's insatiable! She is not even on the third girl on the list, and she's that hungry?! You better get her off your dick as soon as possible,"" Steve advised, and I agreed with him.

""After this practice, I'm headed to Chloe's. I've got to cross off number one!"" Egan declared, and we playfully nudged him. He was a low-key heartbreaker, calm and handsome on the outside, but a fucking demon once he got down to business. Steve was the complete opposite, showing no emotions. As for me, I was a mix of both, sly and cunning.

07:14 PM

I headed downstairs to meet my appointment, and my dad was sitting in the living room, watching the news.

""Where are you headed, Dayle?"" he asked with a stern look, but it didn't faze me. He should know by now.

""Out!""

""Out where?""

""To hang out, of course. With Egan!""

He believed Egan was more decent than Steve. Little did he know that my friend wasn't that decent.

""You better be home before 10!"" he warned, glancing at the large screen.

""Promise!"" I replied curtly, walking away. Then I spotted an attractive woman, probably in her late thirties. She was blonde and really pretty. I hadn't realized my dad had such good taste. Although no one could compare to my mom, this woman was an 8/10 at best. Mom was simply the best.

""Dad, you've got a visitor!"" I shouted, and he immediately sprang up, as if he had been expecting her. No wonder he let me off the hook so easily and extended my curfew to 10 PM. Daddy-slut.

""Hi!"" the woman greeted me with a swift wave and a smile. I shrugged and walked past her, indifferent to her fading smile. Who fucking cares? I got into my car while my dad warmly hugged her. We locked eyes briefly before I finally entered the car.

""I've waited for this for so long,"" Lauren whispered to me as soon as we entered the hotel room I had booked for us.

I slammed the door behind me as we began to undress. She unbuttoned my pants, pushed me onto the bed, and dropped to her knees, cradling my dick in her hand. She started sucking and licking it with an intensity that was driving me crazy. Lauren knew exactly what I wanted, and she was doing it damn well. She scored a solid 9/10 from me. Now I just had to see what she had in store for me next. As I exploded in her mouth, she swallowed everything down...

And with that explosive climax, my mind couldn't help but wonder what other adventures and temptations awaited me on this wild ride. Little did I know, the consequences of my actions were about to catch up with me, and the path I had chosen would lead to unforeseen dangers and unexpected betrayals...",1,1748484077.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Let’s Talk :),"Hey there! I'm a 6'2"", fit, career-oriented guy with a stable job in tech, left-leaning values, and a deep appreciation for meaningful connection. After years of focusing on personal and professional growth, I’m in a place where I’m genuinely ready to find someone to build an incredible life and family with.

I’m of Indian origin and have lived in half a dozen countries before settling in Seattle, where I currently live and work. I bring a balance of ambition, groundedness, and emotional intelligence to my relationships. Whether it’s in the gym, at work, or in life, I believe in constant growth and showing up fully for the people I care about. Friends would say I’m driven, nurturing, and know how to balance structure with spontaneity. I’m looking for someone who’s equally passionate about building a solid, meaningful partnership - based on mutual respect, shared goals, and a healthy dose of fun.

Here's what I'm looking for in a partner:

* **Financially stable and career-minded,** ideally with a strong credit score and the long-term goal of sharing a home (and mortgage!) together
* **Ready to start a family** in the future, with the desire to have biological children
* **Emotionally mature,** self-aware, and experienced in navigating relationships

1kxyzo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kxyzo4/aitah_for_being_upset_over_a_bachelorette_party/,AITAH for being upset over a Bachelorette party .,"This is my very first post. I will do my best to keep to the important stuff. 

I consider myself to be a part of a very close-knit family. Not just close with my parents and siblings, but also close with my cousins . We all are close in age and basically grew up together and I did consider my female cousins sisters, especially since I grew up with brothers . There are 4 of us (female cousins), Danica (37) , Me (36) , Ansley (32) and Tara (19) . 

Ansley is getting married in a few weeks and I thrilled for her and her fiancé , Trea (32 M). Ansley and I had a good relationship growing up. When she was in middle school and the beginnings of High school she would spend summers with me and my brothers. So obviously, I would spend a good amount of time with her. I even took time to teach her how to drive . 
Ansley’s sister and Danica is a couple months older than me and I considered her to be one of my best friends growing up. We experienced a lot of life together, especially in the early stages of our life.
Danica is Ansley‘s made of honor. 
Ansley is not one for a lot of attention on herself so her wedding is small and her wedding party is smaller. Comprising only Danica , Tara and close friend of Ansley’s . I was not asked, nor was I upset that I wasn’t. I understand that she wanted it small and I’ve been in several weddings and would rather be a guest . However, I would have still like to be able to participate in celebrating my cousin in other ways, such as being a part of the bachelorette, or at least having the ability to contribute in someway. 
A few weeks ago, I was going through Instagram stories when I stumbled upon my cousin Tara’s . She posted a picture of a hotel lobby that I am very familiar with. I live in an area that is a tourist attraction. And one of the reasons people come to this area is because of the specific hotel and their spa. I was curious of why my cousin was there but more so I was excited that she was there. I texted her asking if she was still in my area and if she would like to go and grab a cup of coffee or lunch, I wanted to see her and catch up with her. She stated that she already was back in university but next time that she is in town, she’ll let me know. I left it at that. 
A week or so later we are all celebrating Ansley at her small bridal shower and I was talking to my cousin Tara. I told her how excited I was that she was in my area and that it would’ve been nice to see her. She exclaimed that it would’ve been nice if we would’ve gotten together . Still curious, I asked her, what were you doing in my neck of the woods (She lives 1.5 hrs drive away) ? She stated that she was there for Ansley’s bachelorette. I was told that all three of my female cousins got together with the other bridesmaid and had a spa weekend at this hotel that is minutes away from me . 
I felt like such a slap in the face. 
No one in my family lives near me.

Danica , her husband and her children come to my house every Christmas (on my dime) to spend the weekend doing all the fun Christmas things my town has to offer which is quite a 
Lot.  And funny enough Danica and her husband went to that same spa for their baby moon several years before, but stayed at my house to save money.
And most recently, Ansley suggested her and I go to a concert together in my town, even asking if she could crash at my house.
I felt so humiliated at that bridal shower that I did an Irish goodbye with tears in my eyes and began bawling in the car. 
I felt used. I still feel used this feeling hasn’t left me for weeks. 
Something I feel like should be mentioned. All three of these girls live within a Stonesthrow of a large metropolitan area with plenty of high-end spas in high-end hotels. And if they had their spa weekend at one of those hotels, I would not be writing this .But yet they chose to go to the one that was a 10 minute drive away from me. And never mentioned anything. I think I am more  upset because I didn’t have the opportunity that I wanted to celebrate my cousin who deserves it in every way and this seems borderline malicious being left out. 

Some people I have talked to who know my cousins say that they are jealous of me, especially the MOH who planned this event. 


I do have every intention after the wedding to confront at least the maid of honor about my exclusion . But reddit would you be able to tell me , am I the asshole for feeling this way?",3,1748483787.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False
1kxyzd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1kxyzd8/echoes_part_2/,Echoes (Part 2),"Something is wrong. Leo’s message still haunts me.

> ""DO NOT RESPOND. THEY WILL HEAR YOU. YOU’RE NOT ALONE ON YOUR PLANET, OR THE ISLAND.""
We haven’t slept much since. I’m not sure we can.

Control Room – 2:47 a.m.

I walked in and found Luna sitting in the glow of the telescope monitors, chewing the end of a pen. The room smelled faintly of stale coffee and sea salt. She didn't notice me until I dropped my journal on the table.

Me: “You’re up late.”

Luna (without looking): “I never went to bed. Figured if something was gonna whisper again, I’d be here to catch it.”

Me (sitting beside her): “You don’t have to do this alone, you know.”

Luna (finally turning): “I’m not scared.”

Me (smiling gently): “I never said you were.”

She stared at me for a moment. For all her usual sass and smirks, she looked… small. Like that kid again—the one I found crying during simulation training all those years ago, trapped in the dark and too proud to call for help. I never forgot that look.

Luna (softly): “You think it’s really something out there? Or is Leo just losing it?”

Me: “I think Leo’s the last person who would lose it. Which scares the hell out of me.”


Later that Morning
Atlas has started sleeping in the equipment room. Says the walls “hum too much” in the dorms. I know the sound he means. Like someone breathing through static.

Leo’s not talking much. He just listens.
Luna’s been glued to the scope. I worry about her. Always have. Ever since she told me I reminded her of her big brother—the one who died when she was a kid. I never pushed for details. I didn’t need them. She looks at me like I’m a lifeline sometimes, and I’m not about to let go.


Observation Deck – Sunrise

Atlas (yawning): “Dude, I had the weirdest dream. I was walking around the island, but it was like… mirrored? Everything was backwards. And I kept hearing my voice behind me, saying stuff I wasn’t saying.”

Luna (sipping coffee): “Welcome to the club. At this point, if my reflection doesn’t wink at me, I feel ignored.”

Leo (serious): “It’s not dreams. The mimicry is spreading.”

Me: “Define ‘spreading.’”

Leo (pulling a small recorder from his pocket): “This is from last night, 3:14 a.m. I set a recorder in the control room.”

He plays the clip. For a moment, there’s just static… then:

> Luna’s voice: “Hey, can you bring me more coffee?”
My voice: “Already on it.”
Atlas’ voice: “Don’t forget the sugar this time.”



Luna (eyes narrowing): “I didn’t say that.”

Atlas: “I definitely didn’t say that. I was asleep in the damn supply closet.”

Me (jaw tight): “That’s from last night?”

Leo (nodding): “And here’s the fun part—none of us entered the control room between midnight and 5 a.m. Security feed confirms it.”

Atlas (wide-eyed): “Dude… something’s playing us like recordings.”


The voices are getting smarter. More natural. It’s not like a parrot anymore—it’s like us, with tone and timing. Almost like... rehearsal.

We thought we were watching the void. But what if it’s been watching back?


That Night – Dorm Hallway

I caught Luna standing in front of her door, frozen. The hallway light flickered softly.

Me: “You good?”

Luna (barely a whisper): “I heard my own voice... inside my room.”

I stepped in front of her, hand on her shoulder.

Me: “You’re not going in alone.”

I opened the door slowly. Darkness. Cold air spilled out like a breath. We searched the room top to bottom. Nothing. But when I turned toward the bed, I noticed the pillows—neatly placed, exactly how Luna makes them. And on the desk, her notebook… opened to a page she hadn’t written. Ready for the next entry.


Back in Control Room

Atlas (pacing): “Alright, I’m officially creeped out. This is like that movie where the aliens replace everyone and no one notices till it’s too late.”

Leo (quietly): “They’re not replacing us.”

Me: “What are they doing, then?”

Leo (looking up): “They’re becoming us.”

No one spoke after that.

The telescope started whirring. Luna jolted.

Luna (whispering): “I didn’t touch anything…”

Monitor Feed: shifts on its own. The image of the void fills the screen again. But now, a new light. Blinking. 

--. . - / --- ..- - .-.-.- / - .... . -.-- .----. .-. . / .--. .-. .- -.-. - .. -.-. .. -. --. .-.-.-

Leo's voice simply says ""GET OUT. THEY’RE PRACTICING."" But his mouth never moved. Then the void goes black. This time I have a feeling its for good.


We’ve heard our own voices.
We’ve read our words written by unseen hands.
We’ve been watched.
Now, they want to be heard.

I (40f) have been in the same friend group as Carol (44f) for over 15 years. Carol has been with her partner Steve (43m) for about 12 years, and they have 2 sons together age 7 and 4, and the oldest son Gray (18m) from Carol’s first marriage. 
I was always close with Gray, who is currently transitioning ftm, and from a young age every now and then we would go shopping together just so he can get out of the house. He has always struggled with mental health, and I wanted to make sure he was aware that people cared about him. 
Gray turned 18 very recently, so I wanted to take him out and get something for him as a gift. He doesn’t have a driver’s liscense yet, so I picked him up and we went to get coffee and then to a shop he likes. We were having a very nice and chill Friday. He told me he needed to be back by 8 pm since he has plans with his friends, so I was driving us back to Carol and Steve’s house, when Gray just started sobbing in the passenger seat. I asked what’s wrong, and he showed me a text message between Carol, Steve, and Gray, and them messaging Gray that since he didn’t finish 6 of the 8 daily chores, they were going to ban him from coming home for the weekend, and to ask me OP to drop Gray off at his father’s house. I thought it was rather harsh, 8 chores is a lot, I certainly didn’t have that much chores when I was his age, and missing just 2 calls for kicking him out for the night? Gray asked me if we could stop by at Carol’s to get his clothes and anti depressant and ADHD meds, and he will go spend the night at either his friend’s or his dad’s house. I drive to Carol and Steve’s, where they were outside drinking beer, and when Gray tried to go inside Steve basically physically got between the front door and screamed, “NO! YOU ARE NOT COMING IN, THAT IS A HARD NO!!!” While spreading his arms. Carol also screaming “Nope, I told you you’re not coming in!” 
I was in completely shocked. Carol and Steve was always the type to be “keeping up with the Jones,” and liked to present themselves as a liking finer-things, caring how they presented themselves kind of people. for them to scream like this outside their home in the middle of an affluent suburb, in front of a 3rd party (me), it made me think how this was probably a normal way they spoke to Gray. I got out of the car to try to defuse the situation, and said, “hey he just needs his medication, can he just go in or can you guys bring it out?” As to Carol replied, “No, he always does this! (What?? Try to… go inside the house he lives??) he doesn’t need the medication until tomorrow morning! He’s not going in! I’ll bring it to him tomorrow!”At this point Gray was sobbing in the front yard, and I wanted to take him away from the situation so I told Gray to get back in the car and I drove him to his friends house. 
I was so angry about what I just witnessed. Carol messaged me apologizing for involving me in a family drama, thanking me for being Gray’s safe space, and I responded the next day just by asking if Gray got his meds. She said yes. I haven’t spoken to her since. Gray told me he went back the next day in the afternoon to get the medication. 
It’s been a few days, Gray told me he was moving in to his dad’s full time. He showed me text messages Carol sent Gray saying he is always welcome, and that she loves him. They were just trying to help him prepare for when he gets a job. Gray let me listen to a recording he made when Steve was yelling at Gray for only doing 5 of the 8 chores, where he keeps screaming, “DOES 5 EQUAL 8?! DOES 5 EQUAL 8, answer me!! You’re making me do this to you! Your action is what is making me do this!” 
Gray has always struggled mentally, and he tried to unalive himself before. He has been struggling in school, and it made no sense to me that parents were forcing 8 chores on him daily, when he needed to be focusing on school work or his mental health. Carol is a stay at home mom, so 8 chores for an 18 year old seemed excessive, and to scream like that after he didn’t finish all 8 seemed controlling.
Gray has asked for family therapy numerous times, but Steve refuses. 
After seeing them kicking out an 18 year old and refusing to let him get his medication, I think I would like to not be friends with Carol and Steve, because I just don’t stand by how they are treating Gray. However, I’m not a parent, and also some of my friends seem to be sympathetic to Carol for being in the relationship Steve in the first place. Also I know many of the friends came from a family that was much harsher. AITAH for wanting to end 15+ years friendship over this?

I’ve tried this before and it seems to die out every time. But persistence is key right? 



Like many of you, I am a married, dad looking for connection with other guys - something I have lost as I have gotten older. I was told early in my career the way to succeed was to be willing to move to accept promotions. Well, it was fun while it lasted but in the end I ended up getting fired from that job and moved away from essentially every friend I ever had. I still have a few guys I keep in touch with on occasion but it’s just not the same anymore. 



I have plenty of acquaintances. People I see regularly but have limited interaction with. I’d consider some of my coworkers casual friends, but because they are co-workers there is a natural professionalism barrier I think at times that prevents us from getting too close. What I’m aiming for is someone who would develop into a close friend. A friend to share personal thoughts, feelings, and experiences with. Ideally someone in real life, but I’d take a good online friend too. This stage often takes several months to a couple of years to develop. It’s also extra difficult for us as married dads. The spare time we have is laughable. But I am the type of person who is willing to make time for important stuff. Are you up to it?



A little about my interests: I am drawn to outdoor type activities like hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, kayaking, etc. I workout regularly; although not serious about it. I tend to do whatever feels good that day instead of sticking to a plan. However, I keep telling myself I need to take it more seriously. I enjoy running and swimming. The nerdry side of me likes web development. Not a video gamer though. However, I do enjoy word games and puzzles. I like doing handyman type projects around the house until they take too long and it starts to feel like work. I operate on black coffee. While I don’t judge at all - I am just not drawn naturally to people who use drugs, vape, etc.

Been a bit since I made a post, but I don’t think we had anything spectacular the last couple weeks, but I’m back this week with my findings.  These are nearly free and some good deals I found.

Kroger (Fry’s for me specifically):

- Ryl Tea - $1.99 with a $0.50 store coupon that can be used up to x5 with Ibotta offering an additional $0.50/can - limit 2. So try these out for $1.00/each (I’ve had the peach before - super good and I want to try the new Rocket Pop flavor)

- Arm and Hammer Deep Clean 32ct pods $7.99 sale price with 1 in-app coupon for $1.00 off up to x5, bring it to $6.99.  Ibotta is then giving back $4.00 for limit 1, bringing this down to $2.99!!

- Arm and Hammer Deep Clean 75oz detergent with a $7.99 sale price with an in app $1.00 coupon x5, bringing this to $6.99. Ibotta is then giving back $3.00/each up to limit 2, making this bottle only $3.99/each.  Plus if you do all three Arm and Hammer offers, you’ll bonus an additional $1.00 credit.

- Dove products (large array!) are on sale with a digital deal of $5.99/each up to x5.  Some have an additional in-app coupon of $2.00 off for one, bringing this one item to $3.99.  HOWEVER, this $2.00 coupon is the same in Ibotta (where you can’t double dip this one), but they allow you to submit up to 3.  They have also separated men scents and women’s scents into separate offers.  So you could do 5 items in Frys for $5.99 each and get $2.00 back on 5 items instead of just 1. 

Target 

- Brutus Bone Broth (FOR DOGS!!); Target is offering 20% off plus a Target circle deal for 15% off, bringing this item to $5.43/each. Ibotta is also offering $2.00 back each up to limit 3.

Life, post COVID, and getting (somewhat?) older here in North Bay and the surrounding areas have gotten me thinking.  Do you smell the bacon burning?

Are there any men's groups in North Bay?  Groups, associations, clubs, etc. where middle aged and older (and younger, why not?) men get together and chill?

Men's groups where someone can speak freely and openly about their life and issues and events and...thoughts.  A place where maybe someone could make new friends and do fun things, but also talk and lean on your fellow man.  

Picture something like the idea of AA, or group therapy but for dudes who just want to talk and better themselves and each other.  A place where you don't need to feel alone.  Alone.

Yes, there's the North Bay Fishing Group, Mountain Biking Association, Rotary Club, Gun clubs, but is there any group or group of men who literally just chill and talk and drink beer or coffee or water for that matter?

Friends you say?

Go fishing?

Meet new people through hobbies per chance?

Join a sports team, slugger?

Overpriced therapist?

Go to the gym?

...all great ideas and options obviously, but I'm hoping for something deeper I suppose.  A potentially non-religious space for men to talk and help each other out and get through life's struggles...not alone.

Maybe it's a stretch, maybe there should be one...or maybe, like society wants us all to do is suck it up cupcake, but truthfully, you fine North Bayites...can you lend a hand?

I've asked Grandpa Google, and the outlook is bleak but I won't let AI get me down!  I need the old school method of destroying (or uplifting?) my mindset by another human being to really do it for me like a true keyboard warrior, you know?

Separation, divorce, the death of a spouse or loved one, abuse, depression or loneliness the list can go on and on.  Celebration, friendship, kinship, community involvement...is there any kind of mens group in the area?

Saturday she has a convention all day, so I was going to explore. I'm thinking Rupert's for breakfast since I love Eggs Benne. After that, I'll head over to the farmer's market in the TBK Bank Parking Lot, and then check out Guild House Games.

Trying to decide between Carver's and Brewwork's for a burger for lunch. Then maybe a short afternoon hike like Junction Creek Campground via Junction Creek Trail and/or hitting the Botanical Garden. And then maybe Switchback's for Tacos and drinks to cap off the night?

I'll also have some time to kill on Sunday morning while my partner is in more conference things, and don't really have any clue what to do during this time. I'm a big fan of street art, natural spaces, and interesting architecture, so if there are any cool parts of town to grab a coffee and just sort of wander, I'd be interested in hearing about it!

1kxyuy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupplementAdvice/comments/1kxyuy6/i_took_wild_marine_collagen_peptides_daily_for_6/,"I took wild marine collagen peptides daily for 6 months – here’s what improved (and what didn’t), plus a bit of science","Hey everyone! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I wanted to share my 6-month experience with taking marine collagen peptides every day. 🐟✨ I originally started collagen to see if it would help my skin glow and joint pain (old knee injury) and I’ve tracked what happened. I’ll also sprinkle in some research for those curious. TL;DR at the end.

Why I Tried Collagen: I’m in my early 30s, and like many, I’ve noticed my skin isn’t as bouncy as before and my knees crackle from old sports injuries. I kept hearing that collagen supplements might help with skin elasticity, hair/nails, and joint pain as we get older (since our natural collagen production drops). At first, I was very skeptical – some people say it’s just hype or that your stomach will just digest it into basic amino acids. But others swear by it. 🤷‍♂️ Being a bit of a biohack nerd, I decided to run my own 6-month trial with collagen peptides to see if I notice anything real or if it’s all placebo.

What I Took & How: After some research, I chose a wild-caught marine collagen powder (I’m pescatarian, so I preferred fish collagen over bovine). Marine collagen is mostly Type I (great for skin/hair) but the one I got actually includes Types II, III, IV as well. It’s unflavored and I mix ~10g (one scoop) daily into my morning coffee or smoothie. (It dissolves pretty well – no taste, no weird smell, thank god. 🙏) I took it consistently every single day from October through March. I also made sure to take a Vitamin C supplement or have fruit, because Vitamin C is supposed to help your body produce collagen. I didn’t change other supplements or skincare, so I could isolate collagen’s effects as much as possible.

My Results After 6 Months: Okay, the juicy part – did I notice anything? Actually, yes, a few things stood out, some subtle, some more obvious. Here’s the breakdown:
	•	Skin: After around 8-10 weeks, I realized my skin was a bit more hydrated and plump than before. The fine lines on my forehead haven’t vanished (let’s be real), but they’re slightly less pronounced because my skin overall looks less dull. The biggest difference was in skin comfort – usually in winter my face gets really dry and flaky. This past winter, I barely had any dry patches and my skin felt “bouncier.” One morning, I kid you not, I touched my cheek and was like whoa, is that me? 😅 It’s not a miracle or anything; I’d describe it as my skin just looks healthier. (Could it be placebo? Possibly, but I’ll take it!)
	•	Hair & Nails: This was more noticeable than skin for me. My nails started growing faster and stronger – by month 3 I stopped getting those annoying cracks at the sides of my nails. I play guitar as a hobby, so stronger nails = big win. As for hair, I think it grew a bit faster than usual. I have shoulder-length hair and usually have split ends by 3 months post-trim; now it’s 6 months and my ends still look decent. No change in hair thickness that I can tell, but it seems a bit shinier. Might also be due to the extra protein intake.
	•	Joints: This was my biggest surprise. I have a bum left knee that often aches after long hikes or intense leg days. About 4 months into collagen, I realized I wasn’t instinctively grabbing for my knee brace as much. My knee definitely aches less and recovers faster after workouts. I even did a hiking trip recently, and while I was bracing for pain the next day – it was much milder than usual. I’ve read that Type II collagen specifically helps joints, and even though marine collagen is mostly Type I, apparently the one I take has some Type II or something. It could also be that collagen’s amino acids (glycine, proline) support joint cartilage repair. One study I found showed collagen supplements improved knee pain in older adults after 3-6 months . I’m not older, but it seems to have a noticeable effect for me. This benefit took the longest to show up (around month 4 I started noticing improvement).
	•	Muscles/Recovery: I wasn’t expecting this, but I think it helped a bit with post-workout recovery. It’s nothing dramatic, but I felt slightly less sore the day after heavy workouts. Collagen doesn’t have all essential amino acids like whey does, so it’s not a complete protein for muscle building. But it does have a lot of glycine which might aid recovery or reduce inflammation. This is more anecdotal – my DOMS wasn’t eliminated, just maybe 10-20% less intense on average. Hard to be sure, but worth mentioning.
	•	No Major Changes: I want to note some things that did NOT really change, to keep it honest. I didn’t suddenly get glowing wrinkle-free skin or super thick hair – the changes I saw were subtle improvements, not night-and-day transformations. If you have deep wrinkles or severe joint issues, collagen isn’t a magic cure or a replacement for medical treatments. Also, no effect on weight or appetite for me (some people asked me that elsewhere). And energy levels, mood, etc. stayed about the same (any boost I’d credit to maybe the Vitamin C or just feeling good about doing something for my health).

The Science-y Stuff (briefly): Initially I wondered, “Does eating collagen even do anything? Doesn’t our body just digest it?” 🧐 It’s true that collagen peptides are broken into amino acids, but the theory is those aminos (esp. glycine, proline, hydroxyproline) are the exact ones your body needs to rebuild collagen in skin, joints, etc. Some research is emerging to support this: for example, studies have found improved skin elasticity and hydration in women after 8-12 weeks of collagen supplementation, compared to a placebo . There’s also research suggesting collagen can reduce joint pain in athletes and people with arthritis . A lot of these studies are small or funded by supplement companies, so take them with a grain of salt. But generally, the evidence is promising enough that collagen isn’t woo-woo – it has plausible benefits, especially for older folks or those with joint issues. (Collagen won’t build huge muscle or burn fat magically, so it’s not useful for those goals.)

From what I’ve read and experienced, collagen is more like a long-term support supplement. It’s not like chugging caffeine where you feel something immediately. You have to stick with it for a few months to see structural changes, which makes sense biologically (it takes time to repair or enhance tissues). If you’re impatient or looking for a quick fix, you’ll be disappointed. But if you’re in it for the long haul, it might pay off.

How I Made It Work for Me: Consistency was key – daily dosing is important because collagen doesn’t stay in your system long. I also found it easiest to incorporate by pairing it with my coffee routine (habit stacking for the win). Since my powder is unflavored, I sometimes throw it in soup or oatmeal instead, depending on the day. I did notice better results around the 2+ month mark, which lines up with others’ anecdotes that collagen needs time to show effects. Another tip: take vitamin C with collagen or at least the same day – vitamin C is needed for collagen synthesis in the body. And generally, make sure you’re not protein deficient in your diet; collagen is a supplement, not a substitute for a balanced diet.

Potential Downsides: Honestly, I didn’t experience negative side effects. I know some people report bloating or upset stomach with collagen, but I never had any issues – maybe because I took a modest dose (10g, sometimes 15g if I had a heavy workout day). Marine collagen can sometimes taste or smell fishy, I’ve heard. Mine was pretty much odorless; if I really concentrate I sense a slight “marine” hint in plain water, but in coffee or a smoothie I can’t tell at all. The only “downside” is cost: high-quality collagen isn’t cheap. I paid about ~$40 for a month’s supply. It’s not crazy expensive, but it’s an investment in yourself. I decided it was worth it for me, but your mileage may vary if budget is a concern.

TL;DR: Daily marine collagen for 6 months gave me slightly plumper skin, stronger nails, faster hair growth, and notably less knee pain. 🏆 Improvements were subtle and took a few months to appear – it’s no miracle, but I personally plan to keep taking it. Science backs some of these benefits (especially for skin hydration and joint health), though it’s not 100% conclusive. If you’re collagen-curious, be patient and manage expectations. It might help with skin moisture and joint comfort, but it’s not going to turn you into a supermodel or make your arthritis vanish overnight.

Hope this was helpful! I tried to be as candid as possible.  Have you guys tried collagen (marine or otherwise)? What was your experience? Did it do nothing, or did you see improvements in skin, hair, joints, etc.? I’m really interested to hear others’ results or any tips you have. Also happy to answer questions about my routine.

I decided to have a sit down with my Mother, Father, Ex and Brother. We met at a common coffee shop, and I alerted a few close friends of my where abouts and had my location on. Seeing my Ex felt odd, as he didn't just look older but he looked worn down? My Mother tried to hug me but i dodged it and just sat down. It was honestly just awkward silence until I looked at my brother and simply said 

""Why Alex?""

He looked confused but then blurted

""It isn't fair""

I was confused and i will try write his whole rant down because I dont remeber all of it but he bascially said

""Ever since we were kids everyone liked you more, and you had more friends but I had nothing. You were smarted, funnier and kinder but I was just a shadow to my younger sister. I wanted what you had, and when I saw Alex all my resentment came back and I wanted to steal you boyfriend so you could see that I was better and people liked me more.""

I just looked at him for a minute and I realised, that he hadn't changed, and was mad at me for people liking me more? My parents couldn't even meet my eyes, but i still needed more so I looked at my parents and asked 

""Why did you not believe me?""

My Mother shifted uncomfortably and then weakly said

""He was just so believable.""

That was enough for me. No explanation apology just 4 weak words. I decided that this was the last day I would ever see my family ever again. I stood up, and I paid my bill then left for the door. I could hear Alex started screaming my name but I just ran out the door. I was already in tears, and i didnt want to hear what he had to say. I am officially no contact with my family. I have also decided I need to move away and to start over. Thank you all of you who gave me advice, I don't know if i ever will update again but who knows.

Are you comfortable with your girlfriend or wife to have close male friends from work, like texting or calling after work hours, hanging out one-on-one, or grabbing drinks/coffee outside of work? I’m not talking about casual group hangouts but more like a consistent friendship that extends beyond the office.

If you’re cool with it, how do you feel about it if you find out the guy is single, competitive, has playful/flirty banter with her, or even gets a bit touchy (like a hand on the shoulder or playful nudging)? Does that change your stance, or is it still fine as long as you trust your partner? Where do you draw the line between “just friends” and something that feels disrespectful to your relationship?

For context, I’m in a relationship, and my girlfriend has a male coworker she’s pretty friendly with. It’s mostly texting about work stuff, but sometimes it’s more personal, and they’ve grabbed lunch a couple of times.

I trust her, but I’ve started to set boundaries after it was a constant focus on him, and the constant competitive banter, and entertaining and attention that trusting my gut he has more than platonic feelings and is a revolver. My girlfriend is very naive and a very good person who has had male friends before me which I am cool with.

1kxyosm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kxyosm/the_ornate_black_box_part1/,The Ornate Black Box [Part1],"I’m writing this in the hopes that someone out there will find this and take the contents seriously. This is a warning. Do not open the ornate black box with the brass fittings. Let me explain.

My name is Grant. I’m 35 and I don’t know how I ended up here. Well, that’s not completely true. I do know what events fell into place to put me in this whitewashed hell hole, but I don’t understand how or why they happened to me. My life was simple and straightforward. I grew up in a normal town in the middle of the Great Plains. After college, I went on to stumble into a relatively successful career and an adoring wife. I always tried to be pleasant. A glass half full kind of guy and that got me far in life. That was until I found the box.

It all started a few years ago. I got a call from one of my mother’s friends. My phone rang and I rolled my eyes looking at the bright display. I had just settled down for the night after a long week of your regular run-of-the-mill office work. My job was in no way incredibly taxing and I enjoyed it, but it had its days. After a deep breath in, I released all the sarcasm from my voice and tapped the green button. “Hey Susan. What can I do for you?”

“Grant? Have you heard from your mom? She and I were supposed to go shopping at that new outlet mall in town yesterday morning, but I never heard from her. I tried calling a few times, but she hasn’t picked up.”

My eyebrows furrowed together slightly. “No… I haven’t. Is it going straight to voicemail or are you letting it ring?” I didn’t find anything immediately alarming or out of place. My mom would lose her head if it wasn’t screwed onto her shoulders. “She probably just misplaced her phone and forgot.”

“Well” Susan’s light southern accent pitched skeptically through her words. “I’d think that was the case myself if I didn’t just talk to her the day before. We’ve been chatting about it all month. Would you call her for me just to be sure, honey?”

I swiveled back and forth in my computer chair looking at the splash screen of a game I was getting ready to play on my computer. “Sure.” The thought of the adventures I was about to set foot on would have to wait. “I’ll give her a call and let you know if I hear anything.” We said our goodbyes and I hung up the phone. My wife tilted her head, asking me what was wrong. I explained while I brought my phone back up to my ear with my mom’s contact on dial. I remember her scrunch of concern as I heard the ringing tone on the other end. My wife was gorgeous. Curly brown hair and forest green eyes that looked like someone had tossed speckles of amber paint through them. I miss her. The phone rang and rang. No answer. I tried again.

“Nothing?” My wife questioned.

“Nope. Weird. She always answers when I call. She even has that stupid ringtone set just for me. The one of that annoying kid calling for his mom over and over.”

“You may want to consider a welfare check.” As much as I didn’t want to get the police involved, she was right. My mother lived a few towns northwest of us and it would take a few hours to get to her doorstep. Better safe than sorry.

About two hours after getting off of the phone with the police for the check, I received a call back. My mother was found on the floor of her bedroom, severely dehydrated in a pile of her own urine. She had suffered a stroke, but her vitals were still active and she was breathing. The paramedics explained that she had most likely been having seizures on and off for a day or two and was unable to move or comprehend where she was so she could call for help. I was shocked. My mother was the only person I was close to in my family. She was only just past 60. My father and her had been divorced since I was a child and he passed away a few years earlier. “Will she be ok?” I huffed through the phone leaning over in my chair. They explained she was being rushed to the hospital to be treated, but that the worst of it was over. We immediately packed up the car and headed out to drive the handful of hours to reach the hospital. My wife was very comforting the entire time, exclaiming that no matter what, she would be there for me.

I don’t remember much of the drive or walking into the clinically sterile rooms of the ER, but I will never forget seeing my mother for the first time after her stroke. All the machines that were strapped to her body monitoring her vitals made it look like she was trapped in some wicked clinical web of misfortune. Her head turned to me, eyes glazed over and unaware of who I was. They were milky with the haze of brain fog she was clearly experiencing. I didn’t blame her. The doctor said it was one of the worst strokes he had ever seen. A giant blood clot had cut off circulation to one side of her brain for what he presumed had to have been at least 24 hours. It was sad seeing her face drooping to one side, but I didn’t care. She was alive. Unable to speak or use her left side, but alive.

My fingers reached out to gently rub the back of her hand. I was careful not to bump any of her IVs and cause any discomfort. “Hey there, momma. It’s me. It’s your son, Grant.” She looked at me, eyes still as glossy as when I walked in. A trickle of drool bubbled at the corner of her lips and fell onto the course white and green speckled hospital gown she was wearing. I turned around to pull a chair up to her bedside and sit, but stopped when she quickly grabbed my hand. Her eyes were wide, tears welling up in them. I could see the white of her knuckles.

“Baaaagghh!” She forced out. I jumped back, but her hand clung tight to mine in desperation. “BAAAHCUH-SH” The steady rhythmic beep of her heart monitor started to skyrocket. It got faster and faster as she tried to pull me closer. “BAAHKSH! BAAAHKSH! NO BAAAHKSH! NO OPEH! NO!” Footsteps blasted down the hallway as nurses ran into the room. I scrambled back, allowing them room to work.

“She’s having another seizure, please leave.” One of the nurses was already working to keep my mother on the bed and roll her into a safe position. “We’ll get her stabilized and call you when we do.” I took a few steps back, eyes still locked onto my mother’s face. I thought it was twisted in agony or pain, but when the cold glass door of the emergency room slid shut in front of me, I could tell that it wasn’t pain. Her face was drained of all color. It was fear.

By that time, it was late in the night. I was exhausted. The sizzling buzz of the ER parking lot lights were an eerie reminder that we were far from anywhere comfortable. I didn’t have the energy to drive home, so I told my wife to drop me by my mom’s house. I could stay there for the weekend and she could go home to make sure the dogs were taken care of. Despite her plea to stay and comfort me during that hard time, I assured her that I would be alright. My mom lived in a quiet neighborhood. The kind that is surrounded by white fences and full of old retirees. Besides, I had a spare key for the place and I was likely going to need to spend the money we would use to board the dogs for the weekend to repair any damage caused by police officers or firefighters breaking into the house for the welfare call. In the end, my wife conceded to my request and drove me to the house.

After arriving, we exchanged a long hug and a few kisses. I pushed the key into the lock of my mother’s front door. It clicked over smoothly. Turning around, I waved goodbye and watched my car’s red tail lights disappear around the neighborhood corner. I shut the door behind me and turned the deadbolt. No damage here. They must’ve come in through the back door. Yawning, I walked through the large living room toward the back of the house. Lamps that were left on, likely because they hadn’t ever been shut off, cast light on the high vaulted ceilings. I remember thinking how uncomfortably cold I was, which was unusual for the central US in May. I walked past an old Native American painting. It was an art piece of a tanned figure standing in the middle of a field of lavender blue with white wisp-like clothing draped around her in a flat artistic style. She stared back at me with a blank face. I never really liked that painting and the others like it. Not because they were creepy or distasteful, but because they just really weren’t my style. The frame was crooked, so I adjusted it until I felt like it was as straight as it could be without a bubble level and continued on to the back door.

For what it was worth, the police officers tried their best to minimize the cracks in the siding of the back door. By the looks of the paneling, someone had slipped a crowbar into the wooden frame. It must’ve eventually cracked and given way just enough for them to force the door open. I sighed and gave the deadbolt a twist. There was another satisfying click even though the bolt dragged the entire way through. “At least you didn’t lock yourself up too tight.” I said aloud. I was thankful that the paramedics were able to get in.

I turned to head into my mother’s room through the kitchen. Out of curiosity and some loud prodding from my stomach, I stopped to open up the fridge. The cold, dull light illuminated the contents of the chilled portal. My mom lived alone, so I wasn’t surprised to see a few boxes of leftover takeout in the fridge. My eyes stopped on a box of boneless wings in a bright yellow and brown box. Honey barbecue was my guess and I was right. The receipt sticker on the top of the lid said they had been picked up four days prior. Dinner was served. “Lucky me.” I sighed sarcastically. I didn’t feel like there was much to be thankful for at the time. Popping the cardboard box into the microwave, I shut the front and let the beep of the buttons take me into a brain haze. The loud whirring noise hit my ears and I stared at the warm orange light through the protective mesh of the window. My eyes drooped lazily. I watched the box go around and around again. After a moment, my vision shifted showing my reflection. God. I looked like I hadn’t gotten sleep in days. I guess stress really did wear me down. Motion flickered to my right in the reflection. I didn’t turn at first thinking it was just the dots of the metal grating playing a trick on me. Then, it happened again. This time, it looked like a figure standing right behind me. Cold air curled across my shoulder like that feeling you get when you think you are being watched. I whirled around in a panic only to see there was nothing there. My hand dragged across my face pulling my eyelids down with my fingertips. I took a deep breath in then heard a loud DING! Right behind me. “Shit!” I made another about-face and slammed my hip against the granite countertop. The microwave. Of course. All I could do was shake my head at my reactions and grab the electric-charged chicken wings.

In traditional modern appliance fashion, the surface of the wings had reached the temperature of the sun, so I went around the corner to check on my mom’s room while they cooled on the counter. She always loved large wooden furniture; the gaudy kind that she paid too much for and that was always too big for the room it was in. There were a few picture frames on her dresser. Reaching out, I grabbed one and tilted it up to get a better view. The dim lamp in the corner of the room showed me a picture of one of her five dead husbands. This was the newest one. Bob was his name. I hardly even knew him and they were only together for a few months before he passed due to an illness. I was starting to think my mom was some kind of secret black widow who married men for their money and their life insurance policies. I inhaled deeply through my nostrils only to choke up a cough. That was right. One of the paramedics did say she had been on the floor for more than a day. Stepping around the bed, I could see the dark stain on the ground that wreaked of urine. She must’ve pulled the blankets down with her, because they sat askew off the bed. Did she have her stroke in bed and fall out trying to get help? My thoughts darkened at the notion. It was too soon to think about all of that.

On my way out of the room, I spotted a small ornate black box on her bed. My mother always liked to go antiquing, but I had never seen this particular box before. I picked it up and turned it end over end in my hands. The wood was a deep ebony with soft waves carved into the sides. To me, it looked like the ocean at midnight. Each corner was adorned with a brass bracket to help reinforce the joints. Holding the lid shut on the front was a latch of the same bright metal. Looped through a pin, a lock hung open. My curiosity got the better of me as I pulled the lock from its pin. Pushing up the latch, I opened the box. What I saw inside brought a gut-wrenching curl to my stomach, but it shouldn’t have. It was empty. Blank white inner walls loomed back at me. I slammed the box shut and just like that, the feeling was gone.

Box still in hand, I made my way to the couch in the living room with my honey barbecue wings along for the ride. I sat both boxes down on the coffee table and flipped on the TV. Some old black and white monster movie was playing and I felt a smile hit my lips. My mom loved old monster movies. I remember staying up late just her and I watching Dracula or Frankenstein. We’d curl up in her bed with a bowl of popcorn and she’d tickle me when it got to the scary parts. Needless to say, this creature comfort had me slipping off to sleep after the third boneless wing.

My dreams that night were filled with a spattering of what-ifs. I saw my mom, splayed out on the floor. She looked back at me, the cry for help clear on her face. I tried to reach out, but a large spindly hand grabbed my shoulder and pulled me back out of the room. My heels dug into the carpet beneath me, but it was no use. That bone white hand pulled me back with a strength I was no match for. I heard my mom gurgle out a scream as the door slammed in front of me. “No!” I shouted. “Let me go!” Only to be met with silence and dread. I was continually pulled down a long hallway through another door. Just like the first, it was slammed in my face with a bang.

A second hand came from behind. Long spider-like fingers curled around my face. They dug into my skin, ripping my head back. I forced myself forward only to slip to my stomach. “Let…me… GO!” I grunted out while pawing at the floor beneath me. Two more hands gripped my ankles and yanked me back like I was a sheet of paper being effortlessly torn from a book. I saw door after door whiz passed my eyes. Another. Slam. Another. Slam. Another. SLAM. They came faster and faster until I could no longer keep track of how many I fell through. Falling? I was falling. I could no longer tell what was up or down. I tumbled through doorway after doorway, occasionally slamming my side into a frame. One door I flew past caught my elbow on the knob which forced me into a death spiral. “Stop it! Make it sto-“ My words were cut short with a wet splat. Ears ringing, I opened my eyes. The room was blinding and lacked any details. Above me, I saw a doorway. I couldn’t move. My body was broken and bleeding. Another unnatural hand reached around the edge of the doorway above me and grasped the knob. Salty tears rolled down my cheeks knowing I had no other option but to watch in dread. I saw the face of the door rush towards me. The gap grew smaller.

SLAM! I sat up on the couch shivering in a clammy sweat. The TV host of the late-night monster show was rambling on about how the creature from the Black Lagoon was simply a misunderstood sweetheart. I looked behind me at the guest side of the house. A door to one of the guest bedrooms was opened and I could see out the window. It was still dark outside. To calm my frazzled nerves, I flipped off the TV and swung my feet over the edge of the couch. I needed to check the rest of the house. When I stood, I felt my foot press into something soft and damp. It gave way to my weight and I rolled my eyes. My first thought was that I knocked the rest of the wings off the coffee table in my tossing dream state. “Can’t catch a break, can you?” The annoyance in my voice was so thick you could stir it like honey. That annoyance faded fast when I spotted the leftovers still on the table. “Wait, what?” My eyesight traveled to the floor where the black box laid toppled over not far from my feet. I bent down to pick it up. There was a dark substance that looked to have spilled from the box. Pinching it, I rubbed it between my fingers. “Dirt..?” I examined the inside of the box. It was the same bright white, but at the corners I could see a sprinkling of soil. That didn’t make any sense at all. It was empty. Another slam wrecked my train of thought and my head shot up to the guest bedroom. The door was no longer open. I stood in that living room for what seemed like hours, dead silent. All I could hear was the clock ticking on the wall and my heart beating in my throat.

The gold handle to the guest bedroom creaked then slowly began to turn. “If there is someone in here, I have a gun. I haven’t had a good day and I will not hesitate to empty this thing into you if you don’t say something right now.” I didn’t have a gun, but that’s all I could think to say at that moment. The handle continued to turn ever so slowly until the mechanism inside gave way. “I’m warning you!” I yelled at the door, but my eyes searched for anything that could help. I held the box out in my hand like I was holding a pistol towards the door. The door began to creep open at a sluggish pace like something out of a horror movie. The hinges groaned and creaked loudly in protest. “Screw this.” I darted for the hallway and through the dining room towards the garage where I knew my mom hung her keys. “Please, please, please…” I begged. “Please be there.” The keys hung right where they normally did. Snatching them off the hook, I bolted for the garage door. One of the chairs in the dining room toppled over right as I got into the garage. I smacked the door opener. I was not going to test my luck with whoever was in that house.

I hit the side of the garage with my mom’s SUV door, jumped in, and threw the black box into the passenger seat. Pulling into reverse, my head craned over my shoulder so I could follow the short twist in the driveway. I remember rain pelting the windshield. Through the droplets, my headlights lit up a lanky pale figure. I didn’t care to stick around long enough to see if they had a weapon. I floored it down the road, not looking back. It was hard to see through the rain, so I slowed down a little and reached for my phone to call my wife. The rain was really picking up which made it hard to hear my wife's voice over the drumming of water on the roof.

“Hello? Are you ok? It’s four o’clock in the morning, sweetheart.”

“Listen to me.” I stammered. “Someone was in mom’s house. I don’t know who they were, but I woke up to them slamming one of the doors. I wasn’t staying around to find out what they wanted. I’m in my mom’s car and I’m heading to the police station now down Willow Road.”

“Oh my gosh! I’m so glad you’re okay. Please drive safe, baby.”

“Me too.” I managed to gasp. A prickle of pain ran up my side and down my elbow. Looking over, I was greeted by a large purple bruise. It looked fresh. “How the hell did that get there?”

“What? What’s happening?”

I shook my head. “Nothing, sorry. Call the police and tell them to head to the house. I’ll drive to the station, but I need to focus on the road.” The wipers on my mom’s vehicle were working overtime. Each second, they splashed across the windshield with a rhythmic thud-thud, thud-thud, thud-thud. “I’ll let you know when I get there.”

“Of course! I’ll do that right now. I love you.”

Before I could get those precious words out of my mouth in response, something big dashed across the street. I dropped my phone into the floorboard and swerved the wheel to the left, barely missing whatever it was. Over correcting, the SUV splashed back to the right catching water under its front wheels. I began hydroplaning at around fifty miles per hour. I did my best to remain calm with a loose grip on the steering wheel and tapped the brake pedal, but I was already completely sideways. I felt the rims of the SUV hit the grass and gravity leave my seat as I pitched over. Blurry street lights mixed with tossed earth through the cracked windshield. They quickly rolled out of view. A splash of cold water hit my face. I was launched out of the driver side window and into the ditch.

I coughed up murky water and flailed for purchase on something. My feet weren’t touching the bottom. The rain waters were sweeping me down the ditch towards a barred drain at the end. My back connected with the bars. Thud. I did my best to right myself, but I was having a difficult time feeling my limbs due to the crash. I could see the wheels of my mother’s SUV turned towards the sky, steam emanating from the vehicle’s undercarriage. Managing to turn myself around, I grabbed hold of the bars, but couldn’t push myself past the rushing flood current. Cold iron pressed against my face. After some time, I was able to see into the large drainage tunnel. The rain had let up enough that the morning sun was peeking over the horizon. Light reflected off the water and up into the tunnel in eerie hues of orange. A familiar item floated past me. I followed it with my eyes, head cocked over to one side in exhaustion against the bars holding me back from getting swept away. It was the black box.

It floated a little way down the tunnel then stopped. Was it caught on something? Long white fingers emerged from beneath the brown water surface and wrapped themselves around the box. My blood ran cold as the rain that hit my neck. I watched the box rise out of the water. A humanoid figure, pale as snow, rose from the water clutching the object. It hunched over the box. I couldn’t make out any features on its face, but its skin stretched taught over spinal ridges and gnarly joints. It was unnatural, whatever it was. It turned to look at me. With a curious canter, its featureless face wandered back and forth like it was sniffing the air in search of something. It stopped after taking a few steps closer to me. My eyes widened. With a slow, gruesome rip, its skin tore where a mouth should have been. Rows and rows of serrated teeth smiled back at me behind tattered lips. The edges of this thing’s mouth kept widening until I could no longer see the corners. My vision went blurry and the last thing I remember of that crash was the figure taking another step towards me, jaw unhinged.

I woke up in the back of an old couple's car. The people in my mom's town have always been friendly, but I didn't ever think I'd be indebted to people I hardly know. The husband's name is Frank. He said his son is a doctor that we could go see right away. I need medical attention and they are offering. I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. We're on our way their now and they've let me use their phone. I had to get this out somewhere while the details are still clear. I'll write again soon.",1,1748482877.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1kxyo83,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDpartners/comments/1kxyo83/losing_friends_during_a_crisis/,losing friends during a crisis,"my partner has CPTSD and has been really struggling since fall 2024. during this time, two of our closest local friends have been weirdly distant. they’re a couple too, and admittedly we’ve never been very emotionally close but i consider them to be good friends because we talked often and hung out several times a month for like 4 years. mostly group hangs, but it’s always been good vibes and i care for them both a lot. 

i expressed to them a month or two into my partner’s crisis that she was struggling and how hard things had been for both of us. at the time, my partner was having trouble socializing and i communicated to them her request that they refrain from asking how she’s doing because it opens up a whole can of worms and she just wanted to “feel normal” and hang out without going too deep and then freaking out in public (understandable). i realize now i should’ve clarified that they were more than welcome to check in on her via text/phone call and that she could use friends to hang out with every once in a while. i guess they thought they were supposed to just never check in. 

after an unfortunate text exchange in our group chat with these friends and a couple other mutual friends (who we’re on good terms with), my partner impulsively left the chat and i realized it was time to talk about the dynamic. long story short, the friends who’ve been distant have been “taking space” from our friendship because they didn’t feel like we were reciprocating their effort in the friendship, and they felt weird about my partner not wanting to talk about how she’s doing. i don’t know how long they’ve felt this way. it really hurts. i’ll admit i’m not the best at texting back, and my partner hasn’t been either but i just didn’t think it was that big a deal. i truly try so hard to make an effort to show up to important events and plan hang outs, but in recent months that’s taken a backseat with so much going on (we also just had our wedding last month)

my partner took it really hard, she’s blaming herself. personally i think everyone’s been communicating badly. i understand feeling weird about knowing a friend is struggling and being told to not check in, that’s my bad. i should’ve communicated that better. but at the same time, it could’ve been a conversation before things got to this point. it’s especially painful because during this time, the four friends in aforementioned group chat have grown closer (not to be possessive but we introduced them to each other) and we just feel… edged out. over something neither of us really have control over. 

i feel like the way these friends communicated their feelings was cold and detached. they said they’re sorry my partner is still struggling, but there was no warmth in the messages. these friends were literally just in our wedding, and it feels like talking to strangers rn. i asked the friend i’ve known longer to get coffee soon so we can catch up and try to reconnect. she is open to it but still just pretty detached and short. i don’t know where to go from here, except to just try harder to communicate and initiate conversations and in person hangouts. we do have other friends, but this friendship is important to us and i do want to salvage it. i expressed that several times and they didn’t reciprocate that at all :( that really fucking hurt. 

i just needed to vent. this month was already pretty rough and i just feel so not cared for, lonely and discarded. it doesn’t help that i’m my partner’s main emotional support because we’re still trying to get her the right mental health care. i’m trying to hold onto hope that things will one day feel lighter, but today i’m feeling so shit :( ",3,1748482830.0,CPTSDpartners,0,1.0,False

# My (non-promo) nerdy setup

* iPhone 14 Pro, portrait-mode close-ups (\~12 MP, 5-10 cm from scalp).
* Ran each shot through  open-source vision model (tweaked a Colab).
* Prompt asked it to grade flaking/redness/oiliness on a 1-5 scale and recommend proven actives.

# What the AI suggested + what I tried

1. **Severity 3 → “likely seb derm—start with antifungal.”**
   * Switched to **2 % ketoconazole shampoo** (Nizoral) three times a week, leaving it on 5 min. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/zz3i5j/lpt_request_how_to_get_rid_of_dandruff/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. ACV : water 1 : 4 rinse on off-days to reset pH.
3. Cut afternoon coffee, oil production dropped noticeably.
4. Conditioned *only* the mid-lengths/ends with a silicone-free formula.
5. Re-scanned weekly; severity went from 3 → 1 by week 4.

# Results

Flakes down \~90 %, itch basically gone, and I finally wore a black tee without looking like a pastry chef.

# Questions for the hive mind

* Anyone else using imaging/AI to track scalp issues?
* Favourite gentle conditioner that won’t undo ketoconazole gains?
* Any luck pairing antifungal routines with probiotics or diet tweaks?

And we got on the topic of relationships most of us are single or casually dating only and it got on the topic of what a partner should do. This girl ""Allison"" starts talking about how she wants a guy that's tall handsome etc basically all physical traits which I don't think is a bad thing because you like what you like, hears what made me get irritated though she tried to neg and say I could be a model BUT I was soooooo short I mean literally she dragged it out like that which would have been almost cute if she was attractive to me because she was clearly flirting note ALMOST because it's still rude. I just gave her nothing in response though not even eye contact because I didn't know what to say that wouldn't make it more uncomfortable to me. More people went and then it was my turn and I'll admit I have some unrealistic standards too but I wasn't thinking of anyone in particular, she's fake blonde which I didn't even notice until thinking back now... In any case all I said was she has to be naturally blonde and green eyed and not hazel eyes she calls green and she has to be really clean. She got mad and told me that was too specific and ridiculous and some of my friends agreed but oh well. But then she took it a step further and told me I better change my major if I wanted a girl like that which struck a nerve because that's not her business anyway. So I told her she should get a nose job if she want a good looking guy because she's hideous yes I used the actual word hideous because I get ugly when people try to get snarky. She started crying and left early and I'm not sure if I should feel bad or not. Everyone agreed that I was the AH because I tooke it to far. Did I?

I now attribute that to LPR potentially. But I have health anxiety as well so I was starting to get more and more nervous about heart attack and anaphylaxis.

I also added a lot of new stress to the mix around that time but helping out my homeless friend and her family, (ie constant rides to job interviews, doctors, etc) on top on having a stressful life (I have 3 sons with autism) so that addresses the stress portion.

Anywho, the throat pressure increased so I finally went to the doctor. She thinks it's reflux so at least now I'm not constantly thinking I'm having a heart attack or about to die of anaphylaxis. She prescribed me pantoprazole, and am taking it with famotidine. It's been 3 weeks of no change. I gave up coffee a week and a half ago. I was drinking two double espressos a day, one in the morning, one in afternoon.

My questions are:
1. Has anyone else GERD just started in one small span of time? Meaning you're 35 and you dont have GERD, then one month later you have it and it's running the show?
2. Are there ""flairs"" like IBS, and could I just be in like a reflux flair?
3. Will I ever have coffee again? Or is that just like over?
4. Is there a PPI stronger than pantoprazole?
5. Will I be on PPIs forever? Or can a doctor only answer that?
6. Why is it so hard to find my triggers? I'm so lost.
7. Can you have silent reflux and heartburn at the same time? I feel like I have LPR, but I still feel the burn in my chest.
8. I will probably add jogging to the mix, has that helped anyone else?
9. Was it likely my GERD was a sleeping dragon but chocolate and stress brought it out, so I'm stuck with it forever now?",2,1748482653.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

If anybody in prague is looking for a model to collaborate with or is new to photography and wants a model to train with, please contact me!  I can meet you for a coffee or we can just chat here about expectations and goals. I also have some photos available for you to see what I look like and the kind of stuff I've been doing already.

Now i understand being hospitalized is necessary but idk if its just that they dont know how to handle trans ppl or they just dont like them. Anyways ima tell my story and yall can lemme know if that’s similar to your experiences.

So monday i was having a rough day. Its been a rough week but monday was a breaking point. I told my friend that im not ok and he agreed i should go to the hospital. I told the hospital about my desire to well… i told them my name and my legal name which are different. I asked them to put my actual name on things cuz my legal name makes me uncomfortable and theres no point in having it on something unless its a legal document or billing. Anyways they say “well see what we can do” they move me to brief assessment where they lock me in a room alone for 20 hours!!! Then they have someone come see me and the ladies first comment is “if you dont want us to call you by your name then you should have changed it, it would make it a lot easier. Its not like it costs anything (it 100% is not free like she implied it was) then she proceeded to judge me for going to a hospital further away from home as tho im not welcome there and they see me as wasting there time which sucked cuz i chose this hospital cuz its closer to my friends who are my family.

So after this awful interaction im sent to another room to wait in solitary for another hour where a psych says he thinks its a good idea for me to be held on form 42 aka 72+ hours hold. Ok fine, he moves me upstairs to the psych ward and its like 9-10 pm. Im told where my room is and told i just missed dinner. I haven’t eaten since the evening before i was admitted. So its been over 30 hours with nothing to eat. Im told wait till morning for breakfast so i do and nothing comes. I end up passing out from hunger and im woken up at 12 and someone shows up with a tray of food. 

At this point im happy food arrived. My hopes shot up. And then shot down. The tray is ice cold and the toast is wet, the cooked egg is cold. The coffee is ice cold, the milk is chunky and the little apple juice is warm. I look at the tab and it doesn’t only have my deadname on it, it says breakfast. I dont feel comfortable to eat that cuz idk how long its been sitting out cuz breakfast was around 7-8 and its now afternoon. 

At 2 i got my phone back and texted my friend and asked him if he can bring me food when he comes to see me. My friend provided me with some clothes, a towel, some soap, a tooth brush. Things the hospital didnt think id need i guess during my 72 plus hour involuntary stay :x at least i got my phone back.",4,1748482521.0,MtF,2,0.84,False

I recently hired a web developer on Upwork to do a website job for me. The upfront deal was that the developer chooses the timeline but if they do not finish the job in that timeframe that they chose, I would require a full refund for time wasted.

Long story short, the deadline was not met, I fired the developer and revoked their access. About 12 hours after, I received an email from Sucuri (Malware detection and removal service) that there was a suspicious file uploaded.

This is the content of that PHP file. Can any one of you make out what the function of this php file is and how they were able to add this file into my directory without FTP access??

Hey yall, I’m Hannah and I’ve been handling most of Mayday’s finances. As you probably know we are 24/7 in DC. We are doing okay with big ticket financial items, but we really want to find ways to make it easier for people to come spend time onsite with us at the IAC. 

So we’d really like to start pushes to do things like 1) buy DC metro cards to give people who want to come regularly but the cost is prohibitive, 2) ask people to sponsor hostel or hotel nights for protesters, 3) buy coffee for our overnight shift, etc. 

Anyone interested in working with us on this? Email me! Maydayprotest@proton.me",6,1748481968.0,MaydayMovementUSA,0,1.0,False
1kxydii,https://www.reddit.com/r/RCVS/comments/1kxydii/my_situation_please_comment_with_advice/,My Situation - Please comment with advice,"Here's my situation:

Same exact substance-use as has been for 5+ years  
\- Nicotine throughout day (not smoked, vaped)  
\- morning coffee (usually 1 cup but lately had gone up to 3)  
\- light evening cannabis (a couple very small dabs)  
\- 2-4 drinks on weekend

Stress levels are higher lately

Physical activity has been lower, but pushing myself again and feeling better

Noticed symptoms starting 2 weeks ago that very closely lined up with RCVS

\- caffeine and/or nicotine seemed to be a trigger for some numbness in random parts of body (between toes, near ""funny bone"" of elbow), pressure in head, along with one sharp painful headache that felt very scary.  
\- cannabis now causes anxiety, tightness of chest, over-focusing on heartbeat and breathing  
\- Alcohol doesn't seem to cause or exacerbate any of these. 

I have had no caffeine since symptoms appeared as it was a strong trigger for these symptoms  
Nicotine has reduced to about 1/3 of normal amt and seems OK  
Alcohol, same moderate use on wknd  
Tapered off of cannabis, even extremely small amounts seem to cause anxiety all of a sudden for whatever reason. Haven't gotten high in 5 days.

My main concern is if I'll be able to use cannabis again. Maybe in the absence of stimulants of any kind, or when stress levels are lower (still need to look into blood pressure meds but I'm 31M, 5'10"" 165lbs and run/lift regularly again).",1,1748481944.0,RCVS,1,1.0,False

1kxya16,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1kxya16/for_a_whole_year_i_still_dont_know_whats_worng/,For a whole year I still don't know whats worng,"Approximately a year ago, I began experiencing strange symptoms that included hypoesthesia (reduced sensation) throughout my entire body, weakness, fatigue, occasional episodes resembling a neurological attack, along with pain, headaches, and a feeling of imbalance. I also experienced chest and back pain. Over time, I underwent multiple medical tests, including heart examinations, thyroid function tests, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, liver function tests, EEG, and various blood tests. All results came back normal.

These symptoms persisted intensely for about two months before stabilizing to primarily hypoesthesia across my body. Over the following months, the symptoms fluctuated, ranging from mild to moderate intensity. During this period, I continued smoking occasionally and did not follow any specific diet.

In addition, I have persistent derealization/depersonalization (a feeling of detachment from reality and my body), which has not improved over time. I experience pain at the base of my skull, along with chest and back pain and a cracking sound in my spine. My symptoms also seem to fluctuate with external factors:

Cold weather or cold showers significantly reduce the severity of my physical symptoms.

Physical movement (such as being in a moving vehicle) lessens the symptoms, but they return when I stop.

Smoking and consuming certain foods, like strong coffee or spicy processed meat, exacerbate the symptoms.


I was diagnosed with gastritis and esophagitis early in this process, but I am uncertain if these conditions are related to my ongoing symptoms.

Lili looked at Mason in complete shock. ""You're lying,"" she said softly.

""Lying would be a lot simpler, not to mention easier to believe. I asked My to give me a data dump of the scans she made. And I know she's not trying to scam me, because that's a gonk move to try and pull. A ripper wants to sell you some new and fancy chrome, that's one thing. They're not going to lie about you already having chrome in your body."" Mason propped his elbows on his knees. ""I know this is a lot to take in, Lili. But this is real. I've got some thoughts on how to put the bad guys off their game, but I'm asking you to keep trusting me. I've kept you alive and out of their hands for over a week now. I'd like to keep that streak going as long as possible.""

""Can't you just take the implants out? Bring me back to fully organic?""

""From what My could dope out from probing around while you were under, no. Everything ties into that damned 'scabbard' chrome in your neck. It's effectively hardwired in there. And I suspect there's at least a couple little cute fail-safes built in to keep you or somebody else from going that exact route.""

Lili stood up and began stalking around the office. ""Great! So I just sit around, waiting for somebody to say the magic words and make me a killer!"" she snarled.

""Maybe. Maybe not. Lili, I can get you new papers, a new identity. Throw in some bodysculpt and you can live a quiet life right under everybody's nose.""

""They found me once. They can do it again.""

""They found you because you called home,"" corrected Marti. ""The only way they could find you again is if you went back there.""

Lili scowled at Marti. ""And apparently my parents weren't smart enough to stay away from there. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been caught and killed!"" As Lili flopped down on the couch and crossed her arms tightly across her chest, Mason began rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

""Marti, how likely is it that Lili's place got tossed when they went looking for her and her folks?"" he asked slowly.

""I certainly would have searched it, if only to help track down my targets.""

""Lili, do you remember anything about that day when you went on the run? Anything at all?""

""Not really.""

""Try,"" Mason said gently. ""Clear your mind, go back to the start of that day in your memory. Start with breakfast.""

Lili shook her head in disbelief, then took a few cleansing breaths and closed her eyes. ""Breakfast. Bagels, SCOP-lox and soy cream cheese. Honey nut flavor. Mushroom coffee. Papa always called it 'coffgi.'"" A brief smile flickered over her face. ""Left for school. I had a short day, so my friends and I went over to Baywater Arcade. Had lunch there, Vend-It pre-pack. Mongolian-style noodle bowls. I went extra hot because nobody thought I could handle it.""

""What happened after lunch?""

""Just finished lunch. Got a text message on my agent. Didn't make sense."" Shaking her head, Lili opened her eyes. ""Next thing I remember is running like hell, people shooting at me with dart guns, bystanders falling down because the shooters missed.""

""Could you read the characters?"" asked Mason, curiosity burning in his voice.

""No. They weren't English. They weren't any sort of Japanese characters that I recognized. Definitely not Cyrillic. I don't think I've ever seen characters like that before.""

Marti stood up, then went over to the terminal on Mason's desk. After a few moments of typing, she turned the monitor towards Lili and Mason. ""Could they have been these characters?""

Lili came over to the monitor and looked closely, nodding her head hesitantly. ""Could be. What am I looking at?""

""Hangul. Korean alphabet. Though I might take odds on it being Chosongul, the old North Korean version.""

""So, what, they used Korean characters as some sort of trigger?""

""Linguistically speaking, Korean's pretty uncommon around Night City. You get a lot of kanji, which covers both Japanese and Chinese. There's a significant Russian population, so there's a good bit of Cyrillic floating around. If I was running some sort of sleeper cell, I wouldn't be using a character set I knew would be easily found or a language which was commonly used. And somehow, I don't expect Arasaka would possess a sufficient awareness of irony to use Navajo.""

""But we don't know the exact triggers, do we?"" whined Lili.

""Not yet. But I'll tell you what. I'm guessing your folks did. Which was probably a no-no, but might have saved your life. Marti, how do you feel about a little cosplay?""

""Depends on what character I'm supposed to be cosplaying as.""

Mason beamed at her. ""The ever dependable and unremarkable delivery gonk.""



\* \* \*



""*Remind me to thank Mason for a truly novel experience.*""

Marti pushed the delivery cart into the arcology freight elevator and closed the doors, then punched the appropriate button. ""Don't bitch about a compliment, Crypt,"" she subvocalized into the neatly hidden throat mike. ""You're out of the line of sight and there's plenty of air. And no scanners in this shaft.""

""*Yeah, yeah. I just feel like I've been suckered.*""

""A grand for an hour's work. Not a bad payday. And you don't have to share."" Marti allowed herself a very brief smile as she heard no rebuttal.

Cryptagon was one of Mason's ""pet"" netrunners, somebody he kept on speed dial in case something dirty and dangerous came up with a short timeframe for resolution. And, as a general rule, Cryptagon delivered results. Of course, knowing that he was on Mason's shortlist for dirty and dangerous jobs that needed to be worked fast tended to make Cryptagon a touch abrasive at times.

Marti rolled the cart up to the door of the Surovs' apartment. ""Time to go to work,"" she said as she rang the doorbell.

Inside the box, Cryptagon brought up his goggles, getting the layout of the apartment from an electronic perspective. While the box impeded his normal vision, it didn't stop him from seeing the NET architectures around him. A security camera inside the apartment, tied to an alarm, was quickly disabled. ""Get me inside.""

Shaking her head, Marti punched in the bypass code for the door, then wheeled the cart inside before closing the door behind her. She quickly brought Cryptagon out. ""Work fast.""

Tapping a stud on his goggles, Cryptagon shifted the feed from NET to EM fields. ""OK, vid's nothing special. Home appliances, all nice and normal. Really would like that juicer.""

""Focus, Crypt, we're on the clock.""

""No secret rooms here, Marti. If there's a bolthole, it's not in this building.""

""Can those goggles check for something other than EM signatures?""

""Sure. What're you thinking?""

""Something not electronic. See if you can find a slick. And something small hidden inside it.""

Nodding, Cryptagon tapped the stud a couple times, bringing up an infrasound component. He walked around the living room, tilting his head up and down as he scanned for variations in the density of furniture and wall fixtures. Finding nothing, he went into the master bedroom. ""Got something. Closet, there's a gap above the rails.""

Marti came over and slid the closet door open, then brought out a screwdriver and removed a couple of screws holding the rail plate into the doorway. As she removed the plate, a thin notebook dropped out on to the floor. She picked up the notebook, reattached the rail plate, and made sure to pick up any small bits of drywall which had fallen down. ""All right, back in the box, Crypt. Think we found what we needed.""



\* \* \*



Mason looked through the notebook carefully. ""Lili, your folks were a lot gutsier than I would have imagined. They found about the *nohzny systema* by accident. Apparently, they figured out they were just as chromed up as you are, but they weren't quite sure how to go about accessing it. So, they found somebody willing to try and help them hack the systems. It took a lot of work and some really crazy stunts that most rippers wouldn't have dared to try under any other circumstances. But they managed to derive the codes. Marti was right, by the way. It uses Chosongul characters, three-character code groups to form a visual cue. Each cue triggers different 'subroutines,' for lack of a better term, depending on the group. It's chipware without the chips. Somebody inside Arasaka did their homework.""

""So where does that leave me?"" asked Lili mordantly.

""Same place as before, but with a slightly better understanding of what's going on. You say the word, I can help you disappear. The bad guys might find you again, it's true, but they're going to have to work for it. And that leaves you free to stay here in Night City, working with me and Marti, or let you light out for the territories with no backtrail. Or you can take Ichigumo up on his offer. I'd personally advise against it, though.""

""Do you think he lied to you?""

""I think he was as straight with me as he could afford to be. I don't think he said anything overtly false. Like he said, candor was the smart play when talking with me. Still, he didn't go out of his way to tell me absolutely everything. I can appreciate that there's elements he doesn't know about, complications he's unaware of, and the fact he knows those complications could potentially exist is the mark of somebody who understands how the game is played."" Mason shook his head slowly as he gave Lili a sympathetic look. ""It sucks, kiddo, and I know you didn't ask for any of this. But it's the reality on the Streets as of this moment.""

Lili began to pace slowly. ""All right. What are the downsides of me staying here with you after you erase me?""

""Sooner or later, the dogs are going circle back around here. The last known place they have a confirmed sighting of you is in Night City. There's some ways to throw grit in the gears, body doubles, false passage records, that sort of thing. But if they want you badly enough, they'll come back here just to start the search from scratch. They've got the manpower, they've got the cash, and time's just an expression of the pocketbook. It's true for the FIS, for the KGB, for the Koancho, and ultimately Arasaka itself.""

""And I'll still be as chromed up as I am now.""

Mason nodded. ""That is correct. I'm reasonably certain Arasaka wouldn't risk using the codes in some sort of open broadcast unless they were desperate or convinced it was the last resort. But that's looking at the problem today. Tomorrow, next month, next year, next decade, the motives and pressures will certainly be different than they are now. It'd be a sign that they'd written you off and make sure you solved yourself as a problem.""

Lili nodded back in agreement. ""What benefits would there be going with Ichigumo?""

""That's more speculative,"" Mason said with a half-thoughtful frown. ""Given how hush-hush they're being, I'm guessing whatever plans they've got to break the conditioning are probably very expensive. Certainly more than what I could throw at the problem. For damned sure more than what your folks tried. That said, I'm also pretty sure that six month window he mentioned is being wildly optimistic. You'd be in Nagano for at least a year, best case scenario. Worst case, you'd never leave. Least not under your own power. And even if you did get sprung, you'd be stuck working for Ichigumo, or whoever took over the project, till the day you died. You'd always be under the Koancho's thumb. And that assumes Arasaka doesn't have somebody on the inside. Ichigumo strikes me as somebody who keeps his house very tidy, on a personal and professional level. Doesn't mean there aren't rats in the building, though.""

Pinching the bridge of her nose, Lili sighed heavily, then looked over at Marti. ""Need to think for a bit. Join me at the range?""

""Sure, *ma petite*. Nothing clears the head like emptying a box of ammo."" Marti grabbed her bag, made sure Lili was properly disguised, then walked out of Mason's office with her. Mason watched them leave, then went over to his desk, pulling out a marker and an index card.



**Rusalka**

As Marti drove calmly towards Morro Rock, Mason glanced over to Lili. It was hard to say she was dressed for traveling, but she certainly had the air of somebody who had somplace to be. ""You're really sure about this, Lili?""

Lili turned to look at Mason and smiled at him. He could feel his heart breaking under the weight of gratitude and resolve in her eyes. ""I'm sure. You and Marti have done so much for me this last couple of weeks. But it's too big for you. Too big for me to ask you guys to keep helping me. And that's what you'd be doing if I stayed. You said I'd never be free of the Koancho if I went with them. But you didn't mention that you'd be signing up to be targets right next to me if I hung around.""

""You live in Night City, you have to make peace with the fact bullets might be flying in your general direction,"" Mason said huskily. ""Marti's a gunslinger *par excellence*. And I occasionally piss people off even when I'm giving them good customer service. We're used to it.""

""I know. But this isn't what you deserve. You deserve to work your jobs, eat from Felipe's food truck in peace, and not worry about when some giant hammer will come down on your heads because you tried to help out a kid in trouble."" She patted Mason's left forearm gently. ""You did a good thing, Mason Kinney. And I appreciate it.""

The town car came to a stop, setting itself head on against a similar vehicle, a single Koancho agent standing watch with a submachinegun. Marti reached back and took Lili's hand, squeezing it firmly. ""Take care of yourself, *ma petite*. And try to keep in touch, if you can.""

Nodding, Lili got out of the back seat, Mason following close behind, while Marti clambered out with a heavy SMG of her own slung across her chest. She and the Koancho agent were the security detail. Mason walked down the road with Lili, his own machine pistol tucked inside his suit jacket. As they headed towards the spaceport, Mason brought out a low profile headset and powered it up. ""Comm check, Marti,"" he murmured.

""*Read you loud and clear.*"" Mason gave it a fifty-fifty chance the Koancho agent next to Marti hadn't seen the concealed throat mike around her neck, and wouldn't pick up on the subtle pressure she applied to subvocalize into it.

""Cool and steady, Marti. Forlorn Hope after we wrap up. I feel a bender coming on.""

""*Copy that.*""

Up ahead, Mason could see Ichigumo and the other two agents who'd accompanied him earlier. The deal was simple: they'd meet in the middle of the road to Morro Rock, Lili would go with the Koancho via deltajock to Subic Bay, and from there ultimately to the safehouse in Nagano. Mason and Marti, of course, would be free to toddle off back to the Street.

As they got close, Mason's head snapped to look over his shoulder as Marti came up on his earbug. ""*Somebody's coming down the road. Looks like Tyger Claws. Awful lot*\--"" There was a long pause as Mason heard a burst of submachinegun fire, followed almost immediately by another burst in what had to be a heavier caliber. ""*Werewolf!*"" groaned Marti over the comms.

Ichigumo stopped in surprise at the ripples of gunfire, trying to understand what was happening a lifetime too slow as one of the accompanying agents shot him in the back, the other unable to take a bead on Mason as he drew his machine pistol and tapped the trigger twice, putting a round in the second agent's throat and another between the eyes. Bullets slammed into Mason's Kevlar business suit as he brought the pistol around, holding down the trigger and emptying the rest of the magazine into the other traitorous agent. Lili looked in horror as the Koancho agents gathered at the other end of the road started to converge, while Tyger Claw motorcycles jumped over the improvised vehicle barracade and SUVs started to batter the town cars out of position.

""Lili,"" growled Mason as he knelt down by Ichigumo. The man was still alive, but bleeding badly. If the situation ended quickly, they might be able to save him.

""Mason, what do I do?!""

""Check this out,"" he said as he reached inside his suit and pulled out an index card with three Chosongul characters written on it. Lili's eyes widened for a moment, then went blank as the Rusalka programming kicked in. She gathered up the pistols of the fallen agents, reloaded them, then started taking aimed shots at the converging Koancho agents as they came into range. Mason watched in terrified fascination as Lili seemed to swim through the knot of Japanese spies, twirling and bending with inhuman flexibility as her combat mods got their first serious workout. As the last Koancho agent fell, the Tyger Claws came into the fray.

""What did you do?"" Ichigumo groaned as Lili tore into the Tygers, plucking blades out of their hands only to pin them like insects to the asphalt a split-second later.

""I pulled out all the stops. Long as somebody's upright, they're dead meat. I suggest you stay nice and flat for the next minute or so.""

""You were going to betray me?""

Mason shook his head. ""Insurance policy,"" he hissed as he shifted position. The Kevlar had stopped the bullets, but hadn't prevented his ribs from getting cracked. ""Was pretty sure you were straight, but kinda figured somebody with you might be bent.""

The last Tyger Claw fell in a torrent of blood and agony as Lili dismembered them with a shotgun. Without hesitating, she ran towards the side of the bridge, launched herself into the air, and dove down into the waters of Coronado Bay. Mason closed his eyes as he heard the splash. He knew that Project Rusalka hadn't made provision for extended swimming, certainly not any sort of built-in SCUBA system or rebreather mechanism. And certainly no countermeasure for the incredible pollution to be found in the waters of the bay.

Slowly, Mason pulled Ichigumo into a fireman's carry and hauled him over to his town car. Marti sat behind the wheel, bleeding profusely, the muzzle of her SMG still trained on the Koancho security agent's corpse. ""You good to drive, Marti?"" he asked as he carefully set Ichigumo into the back seat.

""Not so much,"" Marti replied with a bloody cough. ""She's gone?""

""Yeah. It was either complete escape and evasion or kill'em all and leave nothing behind. And if we were gonna get screwed, only smart thing to do was go for the latter option.""

""Think you're going to have to drive. I'm not tracking too well right now.""

Mason gently helped Marti into the back seat next to Ichigumo, then got behind the wheel, and began to drive away from Morro Rock. ""I'll get you two over to the Grey Blade. He'll get you fixed up quicker than you can blink.""

""I don't trust you,"" groaned Ichigumo.

""Me neither, choom,"" Mason muttered to himself as he pushed the accelerator.",0,1748481645.0,cyberpunkred,0,0.4,False
1kxy9u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1kxy9u4/here_comes_the_nausea/,Here comes the nausea 😳,"I’m on the second week of ozempic. Started at .1 now at .25. I thought I wasn’t going to have any symptoms because so far I’ve been feeling pretty normal. I’ve had IBS for over 2 decades now and a gallbladder removal that left me with chronic symptoms so it’s normal that I experience not so great symptoms dealing with my stomach to begin with. 

But boy was I wrong lol. I woke up today, ate two pieces of toast and as soon as I started drinking my coffee I thought I was going to throw up. Took a liquid gel gravol which helped immensely. Now I just have diarrhea 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Still waiting on the food noise to disappear. That’s what I’m most excited for. I’m definitely looking forward to losing 80lbs but to not have that food noise on constant replay, I can’t wait. Snacked a bit today between meals but my period is also coming up so that might be the rise in appetite. 

Anywho, just giving my personal experience so far so other people can relate or add comments of their experiences 😊",4,1748481644.0,Ozempic,0,1.0,False

a suit and tie noose with
a smile stapled on it.
Daunting, boring,
annoying as hell—
but it pays
for the walls I sleep inside
and the drinks it takes
to sleep inside them.

They say this is security.
I say it’s a prison
with ergonomic chairs
and stand up desks. 

I used to laugh like
a man on fire.
Now I talk to walls and screens
and they don’t talk back.
no one does.
not anymore.

Trust?
that’s a word they keep
in HR manuals and
locked drawers.
they nod when I pass,
like I’m the office ghost
they hope won’t haunt
them next.

I wonder—
did I salt my own soil?
did I trade joy for
401(k)s and
dead-eyed mornings?

The experts say
no one thinks of me;
they only think of themselves. 
the experts I watch
on YouTube when I
need to motivate myself
to push through...

but I feel their thoughts—
slick with disdain,
like I left rot on the 
shared kitchen coffee filter
of the collective soul.

I was funny once,
full of piss and punchlines.
I cracked open
rooms like beers.
now I’m the guy
no one invites to lunch.
The schedule changed
because of me.

Somewhere between
promotion and silence,
I became
what I never wanted—
a cautionary tale
with a paycheck.

and the worst part?
I still show up.
I still clock in.
because somewhere,
beneath the rubble,
a small voice
still believes
I can laugh again.

Typical pain meds cause fatigue as you know. Does anybody have any tips to jumpstart yourself while in pain management?

I exercise and walk when I can, but currently suffering and down with debilitating pain awaiting surgery, which makes me more fatigued. 

I’m looking for something that won’t cause jitters or nausea. Something that will give me an extra energy boost to get up and out before I can’t anymore. 

I’ve tried Neurogum, KPax Energy before the formula was changed, coffee, mushroom supplements and brain & energy boosters. Nothing is working right now and I feel like I’m fading away. 

Any and all tips are appreciated! It must be legal.

It doesn’t happen all of the time but, some of the time, today seems to be the worst it has been in a while but, I just had a really tired day.

I go into the office one day a week which is today. Last night I got all prepared, usually going in one day a week isn’t too bad.

This morning, I woke up, and it was like I just could not fully wake up. I made breakfast, I made coffee and then I called out sick. I got so anxious that I wouldn’t be able to shake this tired feeling and would be out & about in the world like I was at home, feeling like I’m half asleep.

When I say half asleep I mean I had no concept of time today. I never got hungry for lunch or dinner. I wasn’t particularly engrossed in anything other than flipping between apps and chatting with my friends a bit on my phone. I tried to play some games but that was a bit difficult. It’s like my memory from today is fuzzy. Like everything I did on my phone today has a dreamlike quality to it, just a fuzzy memory.

I’ve said this before to friends, it’s like the camera is on but not recording. Like I’m not focused enough to make memories. I’m just zoning out to some degree. Just elevator music up there 🧠
