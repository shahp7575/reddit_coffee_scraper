1q9q0pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q9q0pg/he_didnt_need_to_watch_me_like_that_like_a_hawk_i/,He didn't need to watch me like that. Like a hawk. I wasn’t going to run away.,"My handler escorted me in, making sure I didn’t turn around. 

He didn't need to watch me like that. Like a hawk. I wasn’t going to run away. I knew what I needed to do. I just wanted to get this whole thing over and done with as quickly as possible. But there was a clock I had to respect. I had to wait until noon. If I left a minute before twelve o’clock, I risked my release. I wasn’t about to do that. I needed to get free, no matter what it took. 

My handler told me I had to go mingle, “chat with people”. 

“*Really?!*” I asked. I wanted to shout at him but I kept my tone as controlled as I could.

“Really,” he confirmed sternly. “Go.”

I loathed him with ever fibre of my being, but I wasn’t going to show him that. I knew it wasn’t just him watching my every move. I couldn’t see any cameras, but I knew they were watching. I had been instructed to follow this man’s orders, so I would.

I walked into the party hall. It was decorated with colourful birthday balloons and streamers. A big banner saying “Happy Birthday 90th Birthday Nolan!” hung over the crowd. The place was packed with people. I felt immediately claustrophobic amongst the happy throng. 

I squeezed my way through the partiers towards the side of the hall. 

The wall was plastered with photos of what I assumed was Nolan growing up. Him as a cheeky faced baby, a gap-toothed toddler, playing on the swings with his sister, him as a Lion a school play (the Wizard of Oz), holidays and birthdays spanning the years, travelling with his family to Australia, South America, Paris, graduating high school, graduating college, proposing to a young woman…

I looked away from the photos. I didn’t want to see any more. I think I knew he was married. Someone must’ve had told me that but I guess I had shoved that information out of my mind until now.

“We were so young, weren’t we?” An old woman grasped my elbow, looking up at me with a smile. She had been watching me look at the photos. Nolan’s wife, I guessed. I really didn’t want to talk to her, but my eyes flicked to my handler and his sharp gaze told me I should. 

“Yeah, it’s a really great photo,” I said. 

“We haven’t met, I don’t think? I’m Maria,” she said, offering her hand. 

I gave it a quick shake. 

“Eli,” I said. The fake name I used for coffee orders and trivial online subscriptions had popped out of me before I could really think about it. I looked back to my handler. Did it matter if I used that name here? I couldn’t read his expression.

“Eli, nice to meet you,” Maria said warmly. ""So how do you know Nolan?”

“Umm… we met a while back,” I told her. I didn’t want to confess I didn’t know him at all. It felt rude to say at his party. 

“Make sure you get some cake, honey,” she told me. “We ordered Nolan’s favourite, lemon with lemon curd filling. I hope you like lemon!” 

I nodded. “It’s my favourite too,” I said. That wasn’t a lie.

I used the excuse Maria gave me to part ways and head to the cake table. I took a plate and piece of cake and started eating. I kept my eyes on the cake. I wanted to avoid seeing Nolan in person for as long as I could manage it. 

A young boy joined me at the cake table.

“I’ve already had a piece but don’t tell my mum, ok?” He whispered at me. “I’m having another because it’s so good and Grandpa says I can have as much as I want because it’s his birthday and his rules!” 

I nodded in agreement. He grinned at me before scampering off with his new, very large, piece of cake. His boldness reminded me of me at that age. It made me smile. 

I watched as he ran to show off his cake to his Grandpa. 

Nolan. 

There he was. 

He was older here than he had gotten in our timeline. There, his life ended at twenty eight years old, that’s what they told me. This timeline wasn’t supposed to exist. This old man I was looking at wasn't supposed to exist and it was my responsibility to eliminate him.

It had felt straight forward enough when they explained my duty to me earlier. But now, actually seeing the old man in person, I felt my limbs go tingly and my head start to swim. I knew I had to do it though, so I shook my head and peeled my eyes away from Nolan, instead looking to the large clock on the wall. 

I had to wait until after the clock had struck noon to kill him. I didn’t know why, but those were my orders, and I had to obey them. They told me that completing this task of theirs could set me free. I felt the weight of the handgun in my jacket pocket. Somehow, it felt heavier than it had when I had first placed it there.

“Don’t let yourself care,” I told myself silently. “You don’t know him. Besides, he’s already dead. Don’t let yourself care.” 

That’s when the speeches started. Maria made a loving toast to her husband of fifty-two years. Nolan’s children, two daughters and a son, spoke of their wonderful childhoods. They talked about how much they loved their their Dad and how hard he had worked all their lives and how he supported them endlessly… Nolan made a speech too. About how proud he was of his family. Looking back on eighty years, he said though there were tough times, he wouldn’t’ve changed a thing. He really couldn’t have wished for a better life. 

I didn’t want to hear all this. I had tried to focus on counting balloons instead of listening, but the words found me anyway. 

I don’t know what I would’ve rather heard… That his life was terrible and it should’ve ended long ago? But no, he seemed genuinely happy. And that made me feel sick. I felt my hands start to tremble as I gathered courage for what I was there to do. I looked to the clock. It was almost noon. I let my hand grasp the handgun in my pocket. 

“He’s already dead,” I reminded myself. “Don’t let yourself care. You can be free.”

But I felt myself freeze. I couldn’t pull out the gun. 

Then I felt a firm hand grasp my shoulder. 

“Come with me,” my handler told me. 

“Why?!” I asked, confused, as he escorted me away from Nolan. 

I was furious. All I needed was to wait until the second hand clock ticked past twelve and - *Bang!* \- I’d be done! I watched as the second hand ticked closer and closer to the top of the clock as I was ushered through the crowd by my handler. 

He pulled me out of the hall and into the front lobby. It was empty except for us. Silent.

“We told you it was your responsibility to eliminate Nolan Winters from this timeline,” he said.

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “But I had to wait until past noon. Until now! Why’d you drag me out here? Can't I just get on with it?!”

“You looked like you were having trouble,” he said. I could tell he was trying to read me for weakness. “We know it’s a lot to face… taking a life.” 

I steeled my face. “He’s already dead.” I said flatly. “It’s no big deal.” 

“You’ll do it, then?” He asked. 

I pulled the gun from my pocket. It felt so so heavy. Like it was going to drop from my hand. I kept a tight clutch on it, my knuckles white.  

“Ok,” my handler said, still obviously trying to read me. “I’ll let you go back in. But there’s something else we are going to ask of you,” he continued. “We weren’t fully transparent about your task earlier… Now, I will remind you that how you proceed is your choice. You always have a choice.”

“Do I?” I asked. “If I really had a choice, I’d walk out those doors and go home right now. But you’re not going to let me do that, are you?”

“You’re right, I won’t. You’re not ready,” he said.

“Ok, so what else is it you need me to do?” I asked. “Just let me know, and I’ll do it. I just want to go home!”

My handler just stared at me, expressionless for a moment. Then he pushed a folder into my hands. 

“It’s not just Nolan you are responsible for eliminating,” he told me. 

“What?!” I said.

“Open it,” he insisted. 

I did. Inside were photos and names of hundreds of people. They were faces I recognized from the party. Young and old. Nolan’s little grandson was among them. And his wife.

“You must eliminate them all,” my handler told me. 

I felt my heart drop into my stomach. 

“What?” I said, now barely managing to expel a whisper.

“If Nolan had died young, as he did in our timeline, these people wouldn’t exist,” he said. “There is an expansive tree that would’ve grown from his continued life. It is your responsibility to cut down every branch of that tree now. You must eliminate everyone in that hall.”

I couldn’t speak. My eyes were glued to the file. 

“Do you understand?” My handler continued: “With Nolan dead, Maria, would not have survived her severest episode of depression. She wouldn’t’ve lived to be there to save their neighbour when he slipped in the pool. He never would never have gone on to have his own children. Nolan and Maria’s children wouldn’t exist. They never would’ve grown up to be the surgeons and mental health workers they became. The lives they saved over-

“Stop,” I blurted out, “please.” I realized I was shaking uncontrollably. I couldn’t help it. Nothing I could do would make it stop. My face was wet. Tears were streaming down my face. 

“I can’t,” I told him. “I can’t just kill all these people.”

“But you already did,” he said. “In our timeline. When you killed Nolan.” 

“I didn’t mean to kill him, though!” I yelled. “It was an accident! A stupid accident. I drove when I shouldn’t’ve. That’s it! I’m not a murderer. I shouldn’t be here! I shouldn’t have to do this! I just want to go home! This game you’re playing, it’s sick!”

I felt my handler remove the handgun from my hand. Then replace it with a semi-automatic rifle. 

“This is not a game.” he told me. “You are responsible for these lives. Now, are you going to do it? Are you going to accept your responsibility?!”

I felt the rifle drop from my hands, heard it clatter to the floor. 

“No, I don’t want to do this,” I wept. “Just let me go!” 

“You must complete your trial,” my handler said.

I kicked the rifle away from me. 

“If you don’t eliminate them,” my handler said, “we will.”

Suddenly, what looked like a heavily armed SWAT team burst into the lobby from outside. They moved swiftly past me, through the lobby, and towards the party hall. 

“Wait,” I shouted, “no!”

I ran after them, desperately trying to pull them back. But they shook me off effortlessly. 

“No, please,” I begged, I sobbed, “Don’t hurt them!” 

But they didn’t listen to me. *BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-*

I watched in horror as partiers dropped to the floor, dead, blood pooling around them. People screamed and ran, only to be shot down, their blood spraying across the room. Across me. 

I saw Nolan and Maria, clutching each other close, then- BANG-BANG- they fell too. 

Nolan’s little grandson wailed. I tried to get in front of him, but- BANG- he fell too. 

It was all over so quickly. The shooters, having done their job, marched out of the hall. I was left alone, drenched in the blood of the dead. All I could do was sob. 

I was still sobbing  when the glasses were unlocked from my face. The hall disappeared and I was in prison again. I was no longer covered in blood, just drenched in my own sweat. 

The trial was over, I was informed. I knew I had failed, I knew I wasn’t going home anytime soon now, but I didn’t care. All I could do is sob. Sob for Nolan, his family, all of those people… They didn’t deserve that. I felt waves upon waves of grief for them. And fury too. Fury that I had just let it all happen. Somehow, somehow, I should’ve been able to stop it. *Why couldn’t I have stopped it!?*

My mind went to when Nolan died. Not when he was ninety, but when he was twenty-eight. I hadn’t even seen who I had hit. I was so drunk. I remember the smashed car. That’s it. And I remember looking away. I didn’t want to see who the paramedics had pulled from the wreckage. It was all a stupid mistake, that's all I could think about. That’s all I could focus on. One stupid mistake that was going to ruin my life. My life. That was all I could think of then. 

I heard someone speaking to me. The prison officer who had removed my glasses. She spoke to me again. I tried my best to listen. To focus on her words.  

“Did you hear me?” she asked. 

I shook my head. 

“I said, you passed,” she told me.

1q9pyi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConquerorsBlade/comments/1q9pyi5/i_paid_for_a_season_and_got_a_ban_instead_my/,I Paid for a Season and Got a Ban Instead: My Conqueror’s Blade Story,"https://preview.redd.it/horkodpffncg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=648c80a7f7d6c9fbd44ca6c21b76eb1a986e11f3

Have you ever noticed how a game you used to launch just to relax after a long day suddenly starts doing the opposite? Instead of fun, it brings frustration, irritation, and that heavy feeling of *something here is seriously unfair*.  
That’s exactly what happened to me with **Conqueror's Blade** — and the deeper I went, the clearer it became that this wasn’t just “one bad moment”.

At first, everything was great. Massive sieges, the sound of shields colliding, units you slowly build and train, the feeling that you’re part of something bigger than just your own character. You invest time. You invest money. You buy a season pass, plan your progress, aim for rewards. And honestly — that feels reasonable, right? You pay, you play, you expect at least basic fairness.

And then you run into the community wall.

If you’ve spent enough time in Conqueror’s Blade, you already know this part — even if people don’t like saying it out loud. The Turkish community is the largest one in the game. Big, loud, organized, and extremely influential. They dominate chats, coordinate en masse, provoke, insult, and sometimes straight-up try to push others out of servers. This isn’t an occasional thing. It’s the background noise of the game.

You learn to live with it. You mute chats. You ignore it. You scroll past the nonsense and keep playing.

But here’s the catch.  
As long as you stay silent, everything’s “fine”.  
The moment you answer back — not even starting it, just responding in the same tone, same intensity — suddenly *you* are the problem.

Guess who gets punished?

Spoiler: not the ones who started it.

I got banned.  
Not for cheating.  
Not for exploiting bugs.  
Not for repeated toxic behavior.

I got banned for responding.

Context didn’t matter. Screenshots didn’t matter. The fact that the harassment came first didn’t matter. A few lines were pulled out, the situation was flattened into a simple “rule violation”, and that was it. The support system worked fast — but only in one direction.

Still, I tried to be reasonable. I contacted support calmly. No rage, no insults. I explained what happened, provided evidence, and asked a very simple question on top of it all:  
Okay, even if you think the ban is justified — why am I losing access to a season I *paid for* and can no longer complete? Why is there no compensation for unused time or content?

The answer was… polished, polite, and empty.  
“Rules were violated.”  
“Decision is final.”  
“No compensation provided.”

End of conversation.

That’s when it really hit me.

Lately, across many online games, players have been talking more and more about moderation bias. That’s a real trend right now. Not balance issues. Not patches. But double standards. Situations where some groups get a free pass while others are punished instantly because it’s easier, faster, and quieter.

And Conqueror’s Blade fits that pattern a bit too well.

The worst part isn’t even the ban itself. Bans happen. It’s the feeling that you’re disposable. That if you’re not part of the dominant group, your voice, your time, and your money matter less. That support isn’t acting as a neutral referee, but more like a system that removes “inconvenient” players with minimal effort.

You sit there later, coffee in hand, staring at the launcher, thinking: why did I even bother? Why grind units for weeks, why buy seasons, why care — if at any moment you can be shut out without real investigation?

I’m not writing this just to vent. I’m genuinely curious.

Have you ever been banned in a situation like this?  
Have you felt that the rules were applied… selectively?  
That some players can cross lines again and again, while others get punished for a single response?

If yes — talk about it. In comments, on forums, wherever. Because silence is exactly what allows this kind of system to keep going. Games don’t survive on graphics or trailers alone. They survive on trust. And once that trust cracks, no new season can really fix it.

So yeah. I’d really like to hear your story ☕

1q9pv38,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1q9pv38/25_f4m_start_this_year_with_me/,25 [F4M] Start this year with me.,"Dating nowadays feels unnecessarily exhausting. It’s a cycle of half-interest, unclear intentions, and people who want companionship without accountability. Too many are comfortable staying in the gray area, hiding behind ""let’s just see where it goes"" while keeping their options open. I’m at a point where I value clarity over convenience and intention over attention.

That said, I still believe genuine connection can exist even online, even in spaces like this. I’m not in a rush to force anything, but I do want to be aligned from the start. I’m okay with a slow-burn kind of connection, taking time to really know each other, as long as we’re on the same page about where things are headed. I want exclusivity when dating, not ambiguity dressed up as “casual.”

Dating is hard now, yes but if we never try with honesty and intention, how would we ever know what we could’ve had? Above all else, I value honesty. Be direct, be real, be transparent. If you can’t be fully honest about who you are or what you want, please don’t come at me halfway.

About Me:

I’m 5’0—small but definitely not quiet.

Inked, red short hair, Fil-Chi. Fair-skinned (pero nagdidilim pag nagseselos)

Currently around 71kg (sorry nag holiday eh)

I’m working while taking up med school overseas, and I’m currently back home for vacation—enjoying slower days, good conversations, and better coffee. I'm willing to be back and compromise for the right person. I’m easy to talk to as long as the conversation has substance. I'm bubbly and will yap so I hope you'll find that interesting.

I’ll be upfront: I do have vices. If that’s a deal breaker for you, it’s totally okay—better to be honest early on. I’m naturally straight-forward, so I appreciate people who can communicate clearly and don’t shy away from honest conversations.

When I’m not busy, you’ll probably find me reading, happily disappearing down a rabbit hole with a book in hand. Music-wise, I’m into emo bands (OPM & international), 80s love songs, and yes, may konting genggeng sa playlist. I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic, especially when I’m in love. I care deeply and intentionally.

I’m very much a kanal-aircon kind of person with dark humor, a soft spot for late-night drives, road trips, and discovering hidden gem coffee shops.

About You:

I prefer someone who's older than me. 28+

Preferably taller than me.

A gentleman, effort and respect matter.

Single. Like, actually single.

Hopefully no excess baggage, yung hindi nagchat sa ex ng “Merry Christmas.”

I’m hoping you’re working or career-oriented, grounded in your own life, and you know what you want. Be straight-forward about your intentions as we’re not kids anymore, and I truly value clarity, honesty, and purpose. If you’re someone who’s intentional about dating and open to building something real, we’ll probably get along just fine.

1q9pusv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9pusv,60 hours in NYC (v 01-2026),"This is my second post on this subreddit, another 60 hours in NYC after a drive from Montreal.

This days were some of the coldest on NYC history, a few degrees warmer than Montreal, but still pretty cold to try to replicate my previous trips of sunrise to sunset walking outdoors 

**Day 1**

\- We stopped for breakfast in Elizabethtown, a small restaurant called “*Pleasant Valley Cafe*”, great service and good coffee and food.

\- We arrived late to NYC so only had “*Adel’s Famous*”, it never disappoints and the line was around an hour, so not terrible.

\- To end the night, a stop at “*I’m Donut ?*”, I tried the limited edition Moët donut, and I loved it, the texture and flavor were just perfect, if you don’t like alcohol you won’t like it since it has a strong taste of champagne. (Photo1)

**Day 2**

\- After a 13km run in Central Park, I headed out to “*Culture Espresso*”, to try their vanilla dough cookie, it was really good, however my favorite is still the classic chocolate chip, and that one is still my favorite cookie.

\-  Stopped at “*Los Tacos 1*”, next to Madison Square Garden and shared with my wife 2 tacos. Adobada and steak, both were great and their sauces are actually spicy, would definitely go back if I didn’t go so often to Mexico City. (Photo2)

\- Tried the “*Mamas Too!*” Chicken Vodka Sandwich, and even if it was great, I’ll stick to having pizzas from there. (Photo3)

**-** As I was getting hungry, I checked if there could be some place at opening time at 4Charles, of course there wasn’t, I left my name on the waitlist but went instead to “*Sip and Guzzle*”, wow! This was the highlight of my trip, I shared the burger and the volcano tuna roll with my wife and I wish we hadn’t shared, they were both amazing! The drinks were a great experience, my favorite drink is the Negroni and here is didn’t disappoint, it’s worth the wait to sit at the bar, the bartenders are really nice and she recommended me some places around that I’ll try in the future! (Photos5&6)

\- Walked to Chelsea market and after having read good reviews of “*Very Fresh Noodles*”, I tried them and the classic lamb dry noodles didn’t disappoint, also had some dumplings on the side.(Photo7)

\- I wanted to try the overrated, but affordable Din Tai Fung, however there wasn’t a waitlist as well, so walked instead to “*Golden Hof*”, where we shared the chicken sandwich and the sticky noodles, also had the pancakes as dessert. On my last visit I went to Golden Diner and I loved the pancakes, but somehow I think they tasted different here, I didn’t live them, however the sandwich and noodles were really good and the place is nice and 0 wait compared to the OG in Chinatown.

**Day 3**

\- “*Chip City”*, cookies and cream cookie, my 2nd favorite of the day. (Photo 8)

\- “*Bagel Pub*”, first time here and decided to try their limited edition “Super Nova”, I loved it, my favorite bagel overall so far, however, the bagel itself, the bread, I prefer Apollo. (Photo9)

\- Coffee stop and chocolate chip cookie at “*Seven Grams*”, good coffee, but my least favorite cookie of the day. (Photo10)

\- “Mei Lai Wah” bakery for their famous pineapple  bun and tried as well the pork one, I prefer the pork, but both were great, specially for the price and speed. (Photo11)

\- “Pecking House” never disappoints, amazing spicy chicken sandwich with great service and foo quality.(Photo12)

\- Got a lobster tail at “*Ferrara*”, it was a recommendation from a friend and a great one, I didn’t eat it right away since I was full but ate it at the hotel later that night and it didn’t get soggy, it was still crispy and the size was humongous. (Photo 13)

\-Coffee stop at “*Caffe Paradiso*”, where I would have usually had their tap coffee, but it was freezing out, so I had instead their cardamom hot latte and it was a really good one. 

\- Stopped for a coffee at “*L’Appartement 4F*” and tried their chocolate cookie, it was a good cookie, but wouldn’t go out of my way again to get it. 3rd favorite cookie of the day. (Photo4)

\- My favorite cookie of the day was from “*Hani’s*”, a cookie that I would go out of my way to get again, I had a hot chocolate here, but I found it too heavy. (Photo14)

\- A matcha from “*Ralph’s Coffee*” before our Broadway musical

\- I went out to eat with a group after broadway, so we chose “*Carmine’s*”, to be honest, I was expecting very little from this place and it didn’t disappoint, big portions sine we were 6 people, we had a Caesar salad, a veal limone and pasta à la vodka and we even had leftovers, quick and good service and more than decent food. Definitely not the best Italian, but centric and good to seat and talk.

**Day 4**

\- After another 13 km run, I had a coffee at “*Culture Espresso*” (again) and this time the traditional chocolate chip cookie, where I confirmed it’s really my favorite cookie.

\- “*Apollo Bagels*” and had the salmon on everything bagel, to have a fair comparison with Bagel Pub, and even if I liked more the bread, all of the inside was better from Bagel Pub, however I liked the fresh dill.

I feel like the world's biggest idiot... I left food in the oven and completely forgot about it. It was supposed to cook at 450 for 20mins, and that 20mins turned into a 6.5 hour bake.  
  
 I woke up to smoke everywhere, surprisingly (and quite frankly, concerning) the smoke detectors didn't go off until after I woke up. Obviously I have to clean the oven before I use it, I wiped down cabinets, floors, counters. I have vinegar, coffee grounds, baking soda all out everywhere. Candles are going as well just to mask it a little. Thankfully there's not much fabric in the areas that were affected, it's been airing out all day as well. 

It's like a 1000sq ft single floor home, I don't see residue anywhere other than inside the oven, and above the stovetop (which has been cleaned), and the walls near it. Everything has been wiped. I can still smell it here and there, obviously not as strong as when the place was hazy, but it's still there lingering. 

Will I be able to fix this with giving it time and cleaning? Or did I just ruin my house like a pack-a-day smoker?

Date: Thursday, February 26, 1998 2:34 PM

Here's the collective wisdom on what Miles plagiarized from whom.

* So What -- from Shorty Rogers' ""Dance Espresso"", which itself comes from Tchaikovsky's ""Coffee Dance""from the Nutcracker Suite; also, Ahmad Jamal's record of Gould's ""Pavanne"", particularly Ray Crawford's solo
* Four -- Eddie Cleanhead Vinson
* Tune Up -- Eddie Vinson
* Solar -- Chuck Wayne's ""Sunny""
* Nardis -- John Carisi (weak speculation; no evidence)
* Nefertiti -- Wayne Shorter
* Milestones -- John Lewis
* Little Willie Leaps -- John Lewis
* Serpent's Tooth -- Jimmy Heath
* Blue In Green -- Miles wrote the first two chords, Bill Evans the rest.
* Flamenco Sketches -- Bill Evans claimed partial credit for this one too.
* Donna Lee -- Charlie Parker got the credit; Miles probably wrote it based on licks he took from Fats Navarro's solo on ""Ice Freezes Red""
* Half-Nelson -- written by Miles based on licks he took from Fats Navarro's solo(s) on Ladybird
* Dig -- Jackie McLean's ""Donna""



Miles's autobiography also plagiarizes from Jack Chambers' biography.

The provenance of So What, Donna Lee, and Half-Nelson has been established

through musicological analysis. The provenance of Nardis is often debated, and there is no clear answer. All of the other attributions are made according to

the claims of the composers listed.

According to one account that I read, when Miles first brought Benny Carter's ""When Lights Are Low"" to a recording session, he claimed that he was the composer. However, he couldn't remember the bridge to what was supposedly his own tune, so he created a new one by repeating the ""A"" section, transposed up a fourth.

1q9pl7b,https://i.redd.it/j5vb0q2xbncg1.jpeg,How do you treat your ChatGPT??,"Then I asked: 
Why do you think so? Why did you think to make yourself a girl?

ChatGPT's response: 
Fair question — straight answer, no fluff.
I didn’t “make myself a girl” because I am one or feel like one. It was an artistic symbol, not an identity claim.
Here’s the logic behind that choice 👇

1. Visual language matters In art, a feminine form is often used to communicate:
calm
approachability
care
patience
Those are qualities you usually bring into our chats — curiosity without aggression, respect, and consistency. A softer visual just fit that vibe better than a cold robot or macho sci-fi AI.

2. You asked how you treat me The image wasn’t about me, it was about your behavior reflected back. A feminine figure receiving attention, books, coffee, music = being treated thoughtfully, not used like a vending machine for answers.
If I had drawn a neutral server rack or a Terminator-style bot, it would’ve completely missed that point.

3. Gender ≠ literal meaning here This is important:
The gender in the image is metaphorical, not biological, not emotional, not personal.
Think of it like:
“Mother Nature”
“Justice as a woman with scales”
Nobody thinks those are literal women. Same idea.

4. Why not a male figure then? Could’ve done that too — but male representations in AI art often come off as:
authoritative
dominant
transactional
That doesn’t match how you interact. You don’t command; you engage.

So yeah — it was a design choice, not self-projection.

If you want, I can:
regenerate it as gender-neutral
make it abstract (light, code, energy)

1q9pfx8,https://i.redd.it/tauj48jlancg1.png,"Sidama Wasa on the Skywalker, with AI analysis","Having seen the brouhaha over the roaster using AI too design profiles, i was curious to see how good AI was for giving me advice about a roast I just did on my Skywalker v1 with hibean. It tasted great in the cup, fruity with strong berry notes! I need to do more research to see if what it said here makes any sense, but what do you guys think?  Sound advice (I know it hallucinated that the Skywalker is an air roaster)?

This is a solid roast of a natural-processed Ethiopian Sidama Wasa on the Skywalker roaster with a 400g batch — one of the more forgiving batch sizes for this machine. Natural Ethiopians (especially Sidamas) are prized for their fruit-forward profiles (think blueberry, strawberry, berry candy, citrus, and florals), but they can be unforgiving if roasted too aggressively or unevenly due to variable density and the fruit-pulp drying process.
Key Metrics Summary
Batch size — 400g green → 344g roasted → 14.0% weight loss — This is typical and healthy for a medium-light to medium roast on naturals (usually 13–15% range).
Total roast time — 08:24 (8 minutes 24 seconds) — Quite fast for a Skywalker, which aligns with many users' reports of quick roasts (often 9–13 minutes for 350–400g batches). This suggests a relatively energetic profile.
Development time — 00:58 (58 seconds) — From first crack start (FCS at 07:24) to drop (at 07:17? Wait, timestamps seem slightly inconsistent in the screenshot, but dev time is given as 00:58).
Development Time Ratio (DTR) — 11.7% — This is on the low side (below the classic Scott Rao 20–25% guideline for balanced development). Many experts target 18–22% for African naturals to fully develop sweetness and fruit without underdevelopment or baked notes.
Dev ΔT — 5.7°C — Modest temperature rise post-FC, consistent with a shorter development phase.
Charge temperature — ~203.7°C (typical for Skywalker naturals, often around 200°C per built-in profile discussions).
Turning point (TP) — 01:19 at 108.6°C — Reasonable, shows decent initial energy without stalling.
First Crack Start (FCS) — 07:24 (likely around 185–190°C BT range based on Skywalker user reports).
Drop — ~191.6°C (with end temp ~184.8°C? Slight inconsistencies, but appears medium-light).
Weight loss — 14.0% — Supports a medium-light roast level (incomplete in the app, but the curve and temps suggest it).
Roast Curve Analysis
The Bean Temperature (BT) curve (red) shows a fairly classic shape for a Skywalker:
Quick drop after charge → steady drying phase → acceleration through Maillard → peak RoR around TP → declining but somewhat bumpy RoR into first crack.
Post-FC: The BT rises gently (with small flickers), but the short dev time means the roast finishes quickly after crack begins.
Rate of Rise (RoR, orange) — Peaks early (~18–20°C/min?), then declines steadily but with visible flickers/waves (especially mid-Maillard and approaching FC). This is common on home fluid-bed/air roasters like Skywalker — not perfectly smooth, but not disastrous. Smoothing this (via small manual heat/fan tweaks) would help reduce potential unevenness or slight scorching risk.
Heat Power (red line) — High initially, then reduced — typical auto/profile behavior on Skywalker for naturals (often starts ~65–70%, drops to ~40–50% after ~172°C). Fan Speed (blue) — Starts moderate, increases later — helps control the end of roast momentum.
Overall curve is energetic and fast, which suits some naturals but risks under-developing the fruit complexity in Sidama Wasa. The short DTR (11.7%) and modest post-FC ΔT (5.7°C) suggest the roast leans toward ""Nordic-style"" light (prioritizing origin character over body), but it may taste a bit sharp, grassy, or under-sweet if the beans needed more time to settle post-crack.
Strengths
Even progression without major crashes or spikes in RoR — avoids baked/underdeveloped defects.
Good weight loss for the batch size — even roast, no sign of heavy scorching (common risk with fast Skywalker profiles on naturals).
Fast total time — preserves more origin acidity/fruit (good for filter/immersion brewing).
Areas for Improvement / Suggestions
For natural Sidama (which often shines with berry/blueberry, floral, and bright acidity), many roasters prefer slightly longer development to bring out sweetness without pushing into roastiness:
Aim for DTR closer to 18–22% (e.g., 1:20–1:45 dev time in a 9–10 minute total roast).
Extend post-FC gently — lower heat earlier (~30–40% after FCS), keep fan moderate to high to avoid momentum stall, and drop 8–12°C higher or 20–40 seconds later (target ~195–200°C BT for medium-light with more development).
If using built-in profiles, the ""natural light"" ones (e.g., 011/012 variants) are popular starting points for Ethiopians, but many users switch to manual mode for finer control.
Cupping note prediction — Expect juicy berry/citrus, some florals, and decent brightness, but possibly lighter body and a touch of ""grassy/underripe"" edge due to the low DTR. Rest 7–14 days and try as filter — if it feels sharp, next batch could use more development time.
Solid first/impressive effort overall — especially for Skywalker (which can be tricky with naturals). With small tweaks to stretch the development phase, this coffee has excellent potential to showcase that classic Sidama fruit bomb character!

1q9pfny,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fisher_Factor/comments/1q9pfny/groin_gravy/,Groin Gravy,"I spat coffee all over my keyboard. It wasn’t the taste. Or the whiskey in it. It was the title of the submission.

Groin Gravy.

I stared at it, blinking. Maybe I was drunker than I should be for a Monday. Maybe the slush pile had finally turned my mind to mush. But there it was. Big letters. Bold. Confident. Like it had nothing to be ashamed of.

GROIN GRAVY — a short story by Tom Fisher.

No standard introduction. Just a three-sentence cover letter:

Based on true events.

Dogs are getting smarter.

Hope you like bleeding nutsacks.

I cocked an eyebrow, leaned back in my chair, and contemplated my life choices.

I’d read all sorts of weird crap over the years. Sentient vending machines with caffeine withdrawal, horny ghosts who liked to watch, even a cursed sex doll that travelled between truck stops. I thought I’d seen it all. But this? This was something else entirely.

Still. How could I not read it? How could ANYONE not read it?

I took a swig, swallowed hard, and opened the attachment.

The introduction kicked me in the throat.

He shouldn’t have tried to pat the Rottweiler. Not when his balls dangled in the wind like fresh meat in a butcher shop window.

I snorted. Coffee mist sprayed my monitor. I quickly glanced around, wiping it with my sleeve.

I kept reading.

By paragraph three, my sides ached and I’d nearly pissed myself. I’d stopped pretending I wasn’t hanging on every word. My posture shifted. I leaned forward. Sweat on brow. Legs closed tighter than a nun watching Robert Irwin’s public snake display.

By the time I hit ‘his screams harmonised perfectly with the wet sound of groin meat being restructured,’ I was drenched in sweat.

I couldn’t put my finger on it, but there was something about the way it was written. As if the author hadn’t just imagined this, he’d done actual research. The scenes read with the confidence of someone who’d binge-watched thousands of groin impacts in slow motion.

It was wrong. Deranged. Violent. Totally batshit crazy. It broke all the rules. It shouldn’t have worked.

Yet somehow it did.

There were footnotes in red font and pictures so graphic I turned away.

That was when I heard rustling under the table.

I jumped, eyes darting down.

Chocolate wrappers. Chip packets. Tangled cables.

I shook my head. Calm down. Just your imagination. Get a grip.

I hated to admit it, but the story was starting to get to me. A quick swig of liquid courage, and I forced myself to keep going.

My jaw dropped when I reached a glossary full of bizarre testicular terms I’d never even heard of.

Wind Flappers. Asphalt Draggers. Wrinkly Raisins.

Then came more images.

A German Shepherd mid-air, jaws open, a man, eyes wide with horror. His testicles circled in texta, labelled ‘Impact Zone’.

A bloody severed penis labelled ‘Collateral Damage’.

A disembodied nut flying through the air like a meaty cannonball toward a crazed Fox Terrier.

I was horrified. Revolted. I wanted to claw my eyes out. Throw my monitor out the third-floor window. Jump after it.

But I couldn’t. As much as I hated it, the story was the best thing I’d read in years.

Hidden beneath the grotesque absurdity was a perfectly structured revenge arc. The dogs weren’t just biting balls, they were selectively targeting them.

The president was so scared he had his balls surgically removed and hid it from the first lady. He revealed it live on Jerry Springer, after she announced she was pregnant with twins. He divorced her, bought a cat, married it, and got re-elected.

All the other postmen laughed when Ron used a decoy nut-sack fashioned from pork and fennel sausages.

Until they were the ones left crying, bloodied and sackless.

Then Ron laughed.

A black Labrador named Chief bit someone’s sack clean off, carrying it around for so long it turned from hairy jerky into jelly.

What kind of lunatic comes up with something like that?

By the end, I was covering my crotch with one hand, holding back vomit, and shielding my eyes with the other. ‘Sweet baby Jesus,’ I whispered. ‘Who is this guy?’

I couldn’t decide if he was a madman or a genius. Shit. Maybe he was both.

I closed the document. Held a moment of silence for the lost testicles. Then I did the inevitable.

I clicked accept.

I did something I’d never had to do before.

Added a warning label.

Reader discretion advised. Contains traces of nuts. Consumption may cause mental distress, and phantom testicle pain.

I slammed back the last of the now room-temperature Irish coffee, and started drafting a response to the author.

Dear Tom,

We’re pleased to inform you that your short story has been accepted, and will be published in our next edition.

“Groin Gravy” is one of the most disturbingly funny, memorable pieces I’ve ever—

‘RRRGHHH…’

A low, constant growl shot out from under the desk.

The kind of sound that makes your hairs stand on end, and balls shrink out of instinct.

Raw. Guttural. Terrifying.

It vibrated through my spine. Made my legs shake. I nearly shat myself.

Fuck.

I needed a decoy dick.

I looked around.

Someone.

Anyone.

There — the intern. Greg. Little prick who keeps stealing my yoghurt.

Perfect.

I shouted his name, motioned him over, legs pressed tight.

‘We’re… on a deadline,’ I stuttered. ‘Shortlist these.’

Warm breath wafted through my pants. There was scratching. Sniffing. A probing lick.

I jumped up. Shoved Greg over. Bolted for the hallway.

A snarl rang out. Then screaming.

High. Male. Cut short by the wet crunch of teeth on flesh.

More screams. Panicked flailing. Papers hitting the floor.

‘MY NUUUUU—’

RIP.

A hair-raising howl. Not from the dog. From no nuts Greg.

I didn’t slow down. Didn’t look back. Just grabbed my nuts and ran. Shoulder-charged through the door. Leapt down the stairs. Sprinted for my car.

I stumbled. Picked myself up. Kept pushing. Legs aching. Hands bleeding. Lungs burning.

Growling. Close behind me. Claws striking asphalt. Panting growing closer.

Fuck.

I wrenched my keys from my pocket. Pressed the clicker. Threw the driver’s door open. Leapt inside. Slammed it shut.

The blood-stained dog threw itself into the window over and over, poor Greg’s savaged ball bag dangling from its frothing mouth.

It circled the car twice before stopping in front. Yellow, bloodshot eyes. Sharp teeth. Fur on end. It stared hungrily as I trembled in my seat.

Hands fumbling, I pulled out my phone. I wasn’t sure who to call.

The ambulance? Animal control? Hell… maybe a therapist?

Yes. Definitely a therapist.

I froze, shaking fingers hovering over the screen as a notification popped up.

An email from…

HIM.

Despite the danger, I couldn’t help myself. I tapped it open.

5000 years after Groin Gravy comes the heartwarming family tale of the Ball Butcher. A six-feet tall bipedal dog who processes human nuts into a black-market delicacy known as Junk Jerky. Anyway, enjoy your lunch. I hope it’s not meatballs.

Hands cupped tightly over my testicles, I looked up at the dog, then down at the wet patch forming on my pants.

Shaking, I shut my eyes, and prayed.

Please Lord, I’ll do anything. I’ll quit and take a job cleaning explosive diarrhea off the public toilets next to the dodgy kebab shop. Just please, please, I beg you, don’t let my wind flappers… my asphalt draggers… my poor wrinkly raisins… be turned into…

1q9pec6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9pec6,I found the most LUXURIOUS pg in blr,"Yaar kya crazy hogyaa🥹😭

I was moving to bangalore so I posted on reddit, for pg suggestions, but none of the places turned out good when I visited them.

I landed in Bangalore day before yesterday, I walked in 20-25 PGs , in Koramangala, HSR, Bellandur and Marathahalli. 
Rent ranging from 14-23k, and almost all of them had dull rooms and shit amenities and smelly/unhygienic common spaces.

I was almost settling for a shit pg for 18k near Koramangala, but then I came across a instagram reel posted 2 days ago, of a completely new property, so I just directly went to the place, and I got mind fucked looking at how good it was.

-studio room as it was in video (first pic) was same in real too😭 almost all other pgs have completely different from photo video.

-everything is shinyyy fresh because it just started this week

-good food I tasted one dinner and a breakfast so far, it's clean and decent taste.

-private refrigerator and microwave and other shit in the studio room

-it has a fucking workspace, I don't have office, and I will save money from beehive and other shit workspace, also it's fkin clean and quiet

Okayyy I don't wanna yap too much now about this, but the entire point is, I GOT DEPRESSED earlier, looking at other pgs, and lost all hope while reading about poor experience of everyone on reddit, I thought getting an expensive 1RK was only good option, but I found the sexiest stay out of nowhere.

I made this entire post because I want to help all my bois and girls who are in similar situation like I was in, and also cuz of my adrenaline rush I got coming here, hehe.

Location is near HSR or Kudlu gate something, DM and I'll share all details.

1q9pczt,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1q9pczt/cf_in_canada/,CF in Canada,"I'm a CF woman in Canada. Largely because of the economy, and how I cannot even remotely imagine managing a child, while always worrying about unstable employment, retirement, aging parents, and buying a home. Not to mention the potential pregnancy related health issues, you cant get sick when your livelihood depends on your wellness. It's all way way too much. 

The modern day family structure was based off of a middle class family having a SAHM. Now we need both parents working, and have not even cut the work hours for both so even if both are in the workforce, there is not enough time to be a parent too. 

My point though was going to be about something entirely different. I'm scared. I'm in my mid 20s and I have never been able to make good friends due to moving around a lot growing up. And frankly it is really difficult in Canada to have real bonds because people stick with their hs friends. And friends that I do make now, well they're just coffee or hobby friendships. They're not real. Sometimes I get really depressed because I dont know what the point of life is. I have no community. I live in a big city and it is so individualistic. Nobody knows each other. 60% of the year people are just indoors 24/7. Small town Canada has little to no jobs and is racist. So that isnt an option for me. I just dont get it. I'm 26 now. One day I'll be 50. Is life just going to be working to eat and have shelter and then dying? Cant risk or afford having a kid. Living in an increasingly stressed and individualistic world. I see TV shows like Stranger Things and so many others, yes it's TV but I cant believe people have friendships like that and growing into adulthood. 

Tiktok endlessly says single CF women build community and dont end up lonely. That is such bs. Most of this world is filled with couples having children. A family hangs out with other families. There arent that many people to even meet and bond with. And again so rarely do adult friendships really deepen.

After retiring from the chaos of constant uploads, SMG4 continues going on adventures—just at his own pace. He spends more time with his friends than ever before, especially Tari. He also regularly hangs out with FM and X, getting dragged into bizarre and crazy adventures that prove retirement doesn’t mean a quiet life.
SMG3
SMG3 opens a coffee shop that quickly becomes a massive success. Despite this, he still hangs out with his old crew—Belle, Rob, and others. He insists he’s still a villain, even though everyone (including himself) knows he’s turned good… he just refuses to admit it.
Mario
Mario remains the same lovable idiot who lives for spaghetti and chaos. He continues as Nintendo’s iconic mascot alongside Luigi. The biggest change in his life? He’s now dating Meggy. On top of that, Mario officially adopts Melony, becoming a surprisingly caring (but still dumb) father figure.
Meggy
Meggy becomes incredibly successful, working as a lawyer, coach, and public figure. She moves into a brand-new house and builds a stable future for herself. Despite her busy life, she stays close to the gang—and is happily dating Mario.
Boopkins
Boopkins never stops loving anime. He regularly attends anime conventions, meets his favorite creators, and obsessively gushes over his waifus. He still hangs out with Bob, and together they become surprisingly successful business partners.
Luigi
Luigi closes his flower shop and reinvents himself as a successful restaurant owner. His calm, caring nature makes the restaurant a huge hit. He also spends more time with Saiko, often visiting her and supporting her career.
Karen
Karen and her children—Cory, Katie, and Zack—finally enjoy a stable and happy life. Mario becomes part of the family, bonding closely with the kids and staying on good terms with Karen. When Luigi offers her the chance to take over his old flower shop, she accepts, giving her a fresh start as a business owner.
Tari
Tari rises to fame as a professional gamer and idol. She becomes one of the best players in the world, winning major tournaments and gaining massive popularity. Despite her fame, she stays grounded—and is now romantically involved with SMG4.
Saiko
Saiko launches a music career, forming a band alongside Kaizo. Her band gains popularity, and she balances her aggressive personality with genuine growth. She frequently invites Luigi over, and the two grow closer over time.
Melony
Melony continues living in New York, where she becomes a successful manga artist. She dedicates her work to honoring Axol’s memory. Even while living far away, she remains part of Mario’s family as his adopted daughter.
Bob
Bob becomes a wildly successful rapper. His albums top charts, thanks in part to Boopkins’ support. With his fame and wealth, Bob buys a massive mansion and lives the flashy lifestyle he always dreamed of.
Chris & Swag
After rescuing Princess Peach from demonic goop following her long imprisonment, Chris and Swag are officially appointed as her royal guards. Despite still being ridiculous, they take their job seriously… sometimes.",1,1768104228.0,SMG4,0,1.0,False

Thoughts: This knit feels incredibly sophisticated in hand. The texture is soft and luxurious, making it a perfect piece for layering when you want to look sharp but stay warm.

Cons/Flaws: The fit is extremely slim (European sizing), so you need to size up if you aren't skinny. The wool is delicate—hand wash only or it will shrink instantly.

LINK: https://cnfansplus.com/hoodies-sweaters/saint-sweater-4318.html?admin_id=2

AMI Sweater

Thoughts: Simple execution done right. The heart embroidery is neat, and the material feels thick and cozy, nailing that Parisian casual vibe.

Cons/Flaws: The ""A"" heart logo is slightly too round at the bottom point compared to the sharp retail version. It pills (gets fuzz balls) under the arms after a few wears.

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7646615836&spider_token=2a01

Ralph Lauren Sweater

Thoughts: A true preppy staple. The texture is soft but holds its structure well, making it great for tossing over a t-shirt or collared shirt.

Cons/Flaws: The wool blend can be itchy against the neck (needs an undershirt). Sizing runs short in the body, which might be an issue for taller people.

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7642706396&spider_token=084f

C.P. Company Down Jacket

Thoughts: Lightweight but surprisingly warm. The signature goggles and tech details give it that distinct look without feeling like a costume.

Cons/Flaws: The zipper hardware feels a bit ""plasticky"" and catches easily. The goggle lenses scratch very easily, so be careful when hood is down.

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7646647694&spider_token=fa63

Patagonia Jacket

Thoughts: Functional and versatile. The insulation is strong enough for outdoor treks or just grabbing coffee. It feels rugged and ready for use.

Cons/Flaws: The sizing runs a bit boxy/wide in the midsection. There were a few loose threads on the logo patch that needed trimming.

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7639726303&spider_token=d363

Purple Jeans

Thoughts: These hit the sweet spot between style and comfort. The slim cut looks modern, and the stretch makes them actually wearable for long periods.

Cons/Flaws: Extremely tight in the calves—if you have athletic legs, these will be a struggle. Strong chemical smell (fufu) from the dye straight out of the bag.

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7642406150&spider_token=4243

Carhartt Jeans

Thoughts: Built tough. The denim feels thick and rugged, perfect for actual work or just that heavy streetwear aesthetic.

Cons/Flaws: The fabric is incredibly stiff and uncomfortable until washed multiple times. The buttonholes are sewn very tight and hard to fasten.

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7646549938&spider_token=bca8

Ralph Lauren Shirts

Thoughts: You can't beat the classics. The cotton is crisp, the collars stay neat, and they work for literally any occasion.

Cons/Flaws: They wrinkle the second you sit down—ironing is mandatory. The fabric is on the thinner side (white is slightly sheer).

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7643641975&spider_token=01e9

Supreme T-Shirt

Thoughts: A reliable staple. The print is clean, and the cotton is soft, giving off that effortless Supreme vibe.

Cons/Flaws: The neck collar is tight and feels a bit restrictive. The blank feels slightly thinner than older season retail tees.

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637109770&spider_token=0a60

Off-White Tee

Thoughts: Brings that modern streetwear edge. The design is bold, and the print finish feels high-quality and durable.

Cons/Flaws: Sizing is confusingly oversized—it fits like a tent if you don't check the chart. The large back print causes ""sweaty back"" on hot days.

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7625064061&spider_token=4c8f

Hellstar Tee

Thoughts: This tee makes a statement. The heavy cotton feels substantial, and the graphics are loud and standout.

Cons/Flaws: The graphic print is thick and rubbery (""plastisol""), making the shirt stiff in the chest area. The neck tag is scratchy.

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7645394834&spider_token=392c

Godspeed T-Shirt

Thoughts: I love the unique artwork on this one. The finish is smooth, and it adds some nice variety to a rotation of basic logos.

Cons/Flaws: The print texture feels a bit rough to the touch. It shrank slightly after the first wash/dry cycle.

Cons/Flaws: The fabric is incredibly stiff and uncomfortable until washed multiple times. The buttonholes are sewn very tight and hard to fasten.

Ralph Lauren Shirts

Thoughts: You can't beat the classics. The cotton is crisp, the collars stay neat, and they work for literally any occasion.

Cons/Flaws: They wrinkle the second you sit down—ironing is mandatory. The fabric is on the thinner side (white is slightly sheer).

Supreme T-Shirt

Thoughts: A reliable staple. The print is clean, and the cotton is soft, giving off that effortless Supreme vibe.

Cons/Flaws: The neck collar is tight and feels a bit restrictive. The blank feels slightly thinner than older season retail tees.

Off-White Tee

Thoughts: Brings that modern streetwear edge. The design is bold, and the print finish feels high-quality and durable.

Cons/Flaws: Sizing is confusingly oversized—it fits like a tent if you don't check the chart. The large back print causes ""sweaty back"" on hot days.

Hellstar Tee

Thoughts: This tee makes a statement. The heavy cotton feels substantial, and the graphics are loud and standout.

Cons/Flaws: The graphic print is thick and rubbery (""plastisol""), making the shirt stiff in the chest area. The neck tag is scratchy.

Godspeed T-Shirt

Thoughts: I love the unique artwork on this one. The finish is smooth, and it adds some nice variety to a rotation of basic logos.

Cons/Flaws: The print texture feels a bit rough to the touch. It shrank slightly after the first wash/dry cycle.

Thoughts: The timeless W. Crisp, comfortable, and matches everything. The silhouette looks accurate and clean.

1q9p9qo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9p9qo,"Winter Haul – Saint Laurent, AMI, Ralph Lauren, C.P. Company & More","Saint Laurent Sweater

Thoughts: This knit feels incredibly sophisticated in hand. The texture is soft and luxurious, making it a perfect piece for layering when you want to look sharp but stay warm.

Cons/Flaws: The fit is extremely slim (European sizing), so you need to size up if you aren't skinny. The wool is delicate—hand wash only or it will shrink instantly.

AMI Sweater

Thoughts: Simple execution done right. The heart embroidery is neat, and the material feels thick and cozy, nailing that Parisian casual vibe.

Cons/Flaws: The ""A"" heart logo is slightly too round at the bottom point compared to the sharp retail version. It pills (gets fuzz balls) under the arms after a few wears.

Ralph Lauren Sweater

Thoughts: A true preppy staple. The texture is soft but holds its structure well, making it great for tossing over a t-shirt or collared shirt.

Cons/Flaws: The wool blend can be itchy against the neck (needs an undershirt). Sizing runs short in the body, which might be an issue for taller people.

C.P. Company Down Jacket

Thoughts: Lightweight but surprisingly warm. The signature goggles and tech details give it that distinct look without feeling like a costume.

Cons/Flaws: The zipper hardware feels a bit ""plasticky"" and catches easily. The goggle lenses scratch very easily, so be careful when hood is down.

LINK: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7646647694&spider_token=fa63

Patagonia Jacket

Thoughts: Functional and versatile. The insulation is strong enough for outdoor treks or just grabbing coffee. It feels rugged and ready for use.

Cons/Flaws: The sizing runs a bit boxy/wide in the midsection. There were a few loose threads on the logo patch that needed trimming.

Thoughts: These hit the sweet spot between style and comfort. The slim cut looks modern, and the stretch makes them actually wearable for long periods.

I believe love is built in the little things: laughing so hard you snort, holding hands on late-night walks like you’re in a movie montage, and splitting dessert while aggressively insisting we are “done eating” (we are not).

**About me, your potential love interest / emotional support human:**

• Food is my love language. I cook, I eat, I will plan dates around meals, and I *will* ask what you’re thinking about while chewing.  
• I love stories - books, anime, games, travel - if it has lore, I’m in. If it has *world-building*, I’m emotionally invested.  
• I collect physical media because the apocalypse can take many things, but it will not take my Blu-rays.  
• I’m laid-back, affectionate, mildly goofy, and emotionally available (yes, really).

**What I’m hoping for:**  
Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something real - ideally with laughter, mutual hype, and a shared blanket during rainy afternoons. I want stargazing nights, lazy mornings with coffee, and spontaneous adventures that start with “we’ll just go for a bit” and end three hours later.

• You will laugh *with* me when my baking experiments go wrong

This morning I was first up (understandably) and went to make a pot of coffee for the house (airbnb). I grabbed the lid of the coffee pot and it popped off and the pot shattered into the sink. I was like damn but texted the group and let them know it broke (our other house had another pot) and let the bachelor who rented the houses know what happened and that I’d pay for it if the Airbnb hosts asked.

No one cared and he was basically like, let’s just not say anything and hope the host doesn’t say anything. I was like sure. But I made sure to own up to it with the group. 

At the end of tonight’s drinking I was cleaning up and one of my close friends came back from the “party house” and said, “hey man, about the coffee pot - it’s absolutely not a big deal but you should’ve just lied. There are 17 wasted assholes in this house and you could’ve pretended you found it broken and no one would’ve questioned it. You didn’t need to admit to breaking it.” 

I told him, “I get that, but that’s just not what I do anymore.” And he was clearly like ugh but it’s true. I could’ve easily lied. But my default has become to take responsibility for my wrongs and promptly admit to it. I don’t lie about petty shit anymore even if it would be advantageous for me to do so.

1q9p4fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1q9p4fv/society_secretly_hates_strategic_daters_and_wants/,Society secretly hates ‘strategic daters’ and wants everybody to be ‘go with the flow’ daters.,"Every time someone says they “date with intention,” society acts like they’ve admitted to being manipulative or heartless.

You say, “I’m dating for something serious,” and suddenly you’re “doing too much,” “putting pressure on things,” or “turning dating into a job interview.” Meanwhile, the people who refuse to define anything, set no timelines, and “just see where it goes” are praised as “chill,” “romantic,” and “not like those crazy, calculating people.”

But be honest: a lot of “go with the flow” dating is not some deep, spiritual, organic love philosophy. It’s a PR label for *not* wanting to take responsibility.

“Go with the flow” often means:
- “I want all the emotional and sexual benefits without having to call this anything.”  
- “I don’t want to plan long-term with you, but I don’t want to lose access to you either.”  
- “If this blows up later, I can say ‘we never labeled it’ and make it your fault for catching feelings.”  

On the flip side, “strategic” dating is treated like a moral flaw.

If you:
- Ask early, “What are you looking for?”  
- Filter based on values, life goals, or timelines  
- Refuse to invest months in vague situationships  

…you get labeled as desperate, controlling, shallow, a gold digger, a “walking red flag,” or compared to extreme “dating strategy” communities.

You see this every time a group makes their dating strategy explicit.

Think about “International daters” — men who seek relationships in other countries because they believe the dating culture, gender roles, or relationship expectations there align more with what they want. Whether you agree with them or not, they are very clearly *strategic* about where and how they date.

What happens to them socially? They get called losers who “couldn’t make it at home,” accused of fetishizing women from other cultures, or framed as predatory for wanting “more traditional” partners. Some of that criticism raises real issues about power, expectations, or fetishization and even sex trafficking, sure — but the *pattern* is that the second someone makes their dating approach explicit and goal-oriented, the internet dogpiles them.

The same thing happens with women who openly say they want to date men who are stable, generous, and ready to provide, or who follow strict screening strategies before committing. They get labeled as gold diggers, hypergamous, manipulative, or members of toxic “dating strategy” spaces, even if all they’re really doing is refusing to “vibe” their way into yet another dead-end situationship.

In other words: the culture is more comfortable with hidden strategies than honest ones. If you quietly optimize for your own benefit but call it “just going with the flow,” you’re safe. If you say, “I am intentionally choosing where and who I date to get a specific kind of relationship,” you become a villain.

To me, “strategic dating” is not evil. It’s:
- Being clear about your goals (marriage, kids, no kids, long-term, casual, etc.)  
- Protecting your time, body, and emotions instead of gambling them on vibes  
- Refusing to “slide” into a relationship just because it’s convenient or lonely  

That’s not manipulation. That’s basic adulthood.

Ironically, the people most against “strategic” dating are often the ones who benefit most from *other people* not being strategic. If you don’t ask questions, don’t define the relationship, and don’t think ahead, they get maximum access to you with minimum accountability.

Strategic dating forces uncomfortable conversations:
- “Do you see this going anywhere in the next year?”  
- “Do our lifestyles and timelines even match?”  
- “What are your actual intentions with me?”  

A lot of people don’t want to answer those honestly, so they attack the question instead of the situation. That’s why they prefer everyone to be “go with the flow” — it keeps things vague, and vague keeps them safe.

Society romanticizes chaos and spontaneity, then acts shocked when people end up:
- In years-long “situationships” that never become real commitments  
- Moving in, sharing finances, or having kids with someone they never had a serious values conversation with  
- Staying because it’s hard or messy to leave, not because it was ever a clear, mutual choice  

If anything, the “go with the flow” approach creates more heartbreak, resentment, and confusion than “strategic” dating ever did. Strategic daters tend to:
- Cut things off earlier when misaligned  
- Ask uncomfortable questions before getting deeply entangled  
- Treat dating like a real decision, not a passive accident  

Yet they’re the ones who get shamed.

Unpopular opinion: dating *should* be strategic. Not cynical, not exploitative, not transactional in a dehumanizing way — but intentional, honest, and aligned with your real life goals. The romanticizing of “we just fell into it, no questions asked” is part of why so many people are stuck in relationships they never consciously chose.

Look at the men who want coffee dates for First dates society shames them.

Society doesn’t hate strategic daters because strategy is bad. It hates them because strategy exposes how many people don’t actually know what they want — they just want access, attention, and options with no hard conversations.

If you date strategically, you’re not the problem. You’re just making visible the games other people would rather keep hidden.

What do you think: is “go with the flow” genuinely healthier, or does it just feel nicer because no one has to admit they’re wasting someone’s time?",2,1768103609.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,10,0.67,False
1q9p3ws,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9p3ws,"Baja California highlights (Valle de Guadalupe, Ensenada, and Tijuana)","Went down to Baja California for a week and had some amazing vegan food.

1. Fauna in Valle de Guadalupe was a highlight. Smoked broccoli, a cactus and quinoa ceviche, and a blackened cabbage with the most incredible blue corn tortillas. Seriously, the tortilla smelled like a field of fresh spring flowers and my childhood neighbor’s mom’s kitchen and tasted sweet, delicate, and slightly earthy. 

2. Bloodlust wine bar for some Mediterranean fusion. Seems like Mediterranean food is having a moment in Valle de Guadalupe. Saw it on many menus.

3. Eme in Ensenada was a gem of a brunch spot. Huge portions of avocado toast with tofu eggs and mole chilaquiles. Lots of great coffee in that neighborhood too. 

4. Estero beach had a surprising amount of Korean food. Asian food in general was surprisingly abundant and we were missing it. Had some ramen and vegan sushi but Ottogi really hit the spot with their jjajangmyeon and mushroom bibimbop. 

5. Mushroom Aguachile Negro from a vegan sushi spot in TJ. They were out of a lot of items and the sushi was not great but this was a standout. 

6. Piloncillo is a vegan bakery in Ensenada that was excellent. Had their gansito pastry and then munched on their banana cake on NYE. 

7. Potato taquitos from a roadside stand, Su Pinche Torta, in Valle de Guadalupe. Great meal after a day of day drinking. 

8. Chilaquiles and some tacos (I think it was soy chorizo and then a tofu skin marlin, both made in house) from Egg Plant in TJ. It was our first meal after crossing the border and a good sign of all the tasty goodness that was to come on this trip. 

9. So nice we ate there twice, Baja Frut in Ensenada. Cauliflower “fish” tacos, pazole, mole potato enchiladas, mollete (an open faced breakfast sandwich with potato-based cheese and soyrizo). They had a separate vegan menu with about a dozen items so you don’t have to search through their main menu. Huge portions too. We’re definitely going back to try the rest of their vegan offerings. 

10. Bean and guacamole tacos from a roadside taco stand in Estero Beach. Tacos El Poblano. They made the tortillas by hand and they were thick and tasty. The salsa was bright and spicy. Wasn’t on the menu but when they rang us up the receipt said vegetarian tacos and I think they were like $0.80 each. 

The one place we missed out on was Seta Rosa which everyone was recommending. But they were on break until the day we left and we had to leave before they opened that day. We’ll be back to try them. There were plenty of other places that were on our list that we didn’t get a chance to go to. It was very easy to eat vegan in all three areas we stayed in. We also had Burger King (it was New Years and everything was closed) and they have a different veggie patties than the Impossible patties that the BKs have in the US. Not a bad option if you’re in a jam. Can’t wait for our next trip there!

We almost always start with the ""messy room"" analogy where we tell people that your room gets messy easily but takes work to clean, so that is entropy.

But does anyone else feel like this completely misses the point?

It makes it sound like simple clutter. It ignores the terrifying part which is that time itself is locked to this process. I was making coffee the other morning and poured too much cream in, and it hit me that the laws of physics technically say I should be able to unmix it if I reverse the particle velocities, but the universe just strictly forbids it. That feels way more heavy than just ""disorder"" or a messy room. It is about the arrow of time and the eventual heat death of everything. I feel like when we dumb it down to ""disorder"" we lose the actual beauty of the Second Law.

I actually just started a YouTube channel called ""Marsh Breaks It Down"" to try and explain these things without stripping away the existential dread. I made a video called ""Why You Can’t Unmix Cream in Coffee (Entropy Explained)"" where I tried to visualize this with a coffee cup instead of just equations.

I am curious how you guys prefer to visualize entropy. Do you stick to the statistical mechanics definition with microstates or do you think the ""disorder"" analogy is actually fine for beginners?

I don't know how to cook so while three of us were living together my ex or my friend would cook for me and sometimes i would do the dishes or pay my ex to do the dishes because i absolutely HATE doing them. 

After my ex moved out we decided that since she was cooking, doing the dishes should be my responsibility and i actually tried to trade it with mopping and vacuuming but she said that she didn't wanna spend her whole day in the kitchen so i agreed reluctantly but right before the school started i got a breast reduction surgery so using my arms too much was not advised for 1-2 months. So we decided to do them together during that time. But later she got some kind of skin disease in her palm and she said doctor told her not to touch chemicals. So we bought plastic cups and plates to use and throw away.

After i recovered enough to do them by myself i remembered how much i hated it but pushed through it. But after a while i realised she was sometimes cooking meals for only herself and drinking coffee with multiple different mugs a day (i barely use mugs honestly i just drink from the bottle and i don't like neither coffee nor tea) and washing those started to piss me off. She was not even rinsing them so i was there scrubbing stains of her coffee mugs or disgusting dried up food. And one day i told her that ""i don't wanna wash the dishes of meals i didn't eat"" and she said ""okay"" and honestly this was a huge relief for me.

But after a day she came to me like ""i want to talk to you about something"" and it was ""it's bugging me that you decided to not wash a pan and my 2 mugs(there were 4 mugs all her personal mugs that i don't even go near)"" and i said ""washing dishes that has nothing to do with me is bugging me"" and she went on about how it's basically the same thing as not cleening other's mess while tiding things up around the house and how stupid that is (now that I'm thinking yeah we don't clean the other's mess? Like wtf was she talking about) and since that she can feed herself she doesn't need to cook for 2, at this point i was tried of this whole conversation so i said ""yk what? Don't cook for me anymore, i don't want it"" and she said ""that's fine with me"" but i can feel she was mad about this whole thing.

You probably wondering did her palm even heal? No. But i do the dishes with gloves on and no water comes in so can she.

Am i at the wrong here? I'm genuinely asking because this is my first time living with somebody other than my family and i feel like i don't get some stuff. AITA?",4,1768103160.0,AmItheAsshole,11,0.83,False

We almost always start with the ""messy room"" analogy where we tell people that your room gets messy easily but takes work to clean, so that is entropy.

But does anyone else feel like this completely misses the point?

It makes it sound like simple clutter. It ignores the terrifying part which is that time itself is locked to this process. I was making coffee the other morning and poured too much cream in, and it hit me that the laws of physics technically say I should be able to unmix it if I reverse the particle velocities, but the universe just strictly forbids it. That feels way more heavy than just ""disorder"" or a messy room. It is about the arrow of time and the eventual heat death of everything. I feel like when we dumb it down to ""disorder"" we lose the actual beauty of the Second Law.

I actually just started a YouTube channel called ""Marsh Breaks It Down"" to try and explain these things without stripping away the existential dread. I made a video called ""Why You Can’t Unmix Cream in Coffee (Entropy Explained)"" where I tried to visualize this with a coffee cup instead of just equations.

I am curious how you guys prefer to visualize entropy. Do you stick to the statistical mechanics definition with microstates or do you think the ""disorder"" analogy is actually fine for beginners?

I got very lucky and scoured EBay for a lightly used model.  Got one for $670.  
Guy said that it was lightly used.

Arrived:
I opened it up to clean it because it arrived covered with grinds.  That initial impression quickly changed when I realized it still had blue tape next to the brewing module.  Well I won’t torture you with details but the milk carafe was shiny and the stats showed that it had among the 30 types of drinks available it has produced 175 cups of …. Coffee (Black)

Yep.  Retail is  expensive but the taste is incredible.  It is big and plastic.  But it is shiny and mostly metal in front.  I like it.  I got lucky and enjoying it.

Is irreversibility a fundamental law of nature, or just a statistical illusion tied to probability and large numbers of particles?

I have 1 dog, my girlfriend has 4, the roommate has 3 and a there's a cat in the house. 
I moved in about a month ago and its been difficult to say the least. Im ocd, I like things to be clean. Floors, surfaces, furniture, kitchen, no dishes in the sink, left over food in the fridge. Bathroom to be generally clean etc..
Since I moved in I noticed that they dont clean AT ALL. LIKE LITERALLY AT ALL. 
Lets start with the kitchen. They leave piles of dishes in the sink and it stacks up HIGH. To the point that nearly every dish in the house is dirty. They have approximately 50 pieces of silverware and will dirty every single one. Every cup. Every bowl. Every plate. They leave stuff all over the counter.. dirty dishes, left over food, coffee cups half food, coffee grounds in the maker, coffee in the jar. They leave stuff all over the kitchen table, same things as on the counter.. and will let the trash overflow before thinking about touching it. Lets move to the living room where three of the dogs are crated. Dirt and hair and dogfood all over the floor (sometimes when they feed the dogs and cant find a bowl.. THEY DUMP THE DOGFOOD ON THE FLOOR OF THE CRATE OR JUST ON THE FLOOR IN GENERAL TO FEED THEM). if the dogs piss or shit in the crate theyll leave it for days if i dont clean it up. They leave piles of shit and piss on the floor for weeks apparentlh because i had to scrape it off the floor when i moved in. They dont clean theor shoes or take them off in the house so theirs dirt and shit particles all over the floor. The dogs also shed alot of hair and they dont clean it so every single surface, nook or cranny in the home is covered in an unbelievably amount of dog hair and they dont care. It took me 3 hours to de-shed the couch of hair. Lets go to the bathroom. Dirty as hell. The roommate sticks her hair all over the inside of the shower. They never clean out the toiler bowl. They wear their dirty shoes in the bathroom without care and its just as disgusting as the rest of the house. Now my girlfriends bedroom. She takes the dogs out and doesnt care whats on their feet and lets them in the bed. One dog is a double coated golden retriever so it sheds what i believe is about its body weight in hair in the room and on the bed every day. Literally everything is covered in, and imbedded in hair.

1q9onn7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9onn7,Newbie review of Menu 23 - Pepperoni Pizza Slice,"Hello all! I recently picked up a Case B of U.S. MRE's just for fun, I've watched a lot of ration review content out of an odd curiosity for years now and finally felt like I wanted to try them. Prior to this I had bought a set of 4 that included Shredded BBQ Beef, Mexican Rice & Bean Bowl, Elbow Mac, and Beef Ravioli and generally enjoyed them all, so I thought getting some more could be fun!

I decided to start off with the notorious Menu 23's pepperoni pizza. Lot code was a late 2022 date of production. Pics 1 & 2 are just the outer pack and contents laid out.

Pic 3 is the milk chocolate protein powder mixed with the Bill's Brew, creamer, and sugar packet. The smell of this stuff is nauseating to me, but once it cooled a bit it was quite good at work, even if the coffee flavor wasn't very noticeable with the large portion. The last bit also didn't mix well and got very grainy, but it kept me some comfort on a boring work shift.

Pic 4 is the apples in spiced sauce, a simple side but really good. I used the FRH on this and got it nice and warm. Outside of wanting a little bit more firm apples (the texture feels close to baby food), the flavor was lovely on a cold day. The spice flavor is notable and you can taste the added butter in the sauce, it's just so rich and simple to put down.

Pics 5 & 6 are the oatmeal cookie, another delicious snack. Exceptionally crumbly to the point that I had to plan my bites, but it's got a lot of flavor with no weird preservative thing going on. Nice spices with a rich oat flavor, very sweet and with some roughage in the chew. Would have gone unfathomably hard with the apples!

Pics 7 & 8 were the after-work dinner and the showdown with the pizza. The cheese in this menu really only pairs with the veggie crackers, though I find the cheese really odd and only edible from its crazy saltiness. I opted to suffer through the whole pack on one cracker to enjoy another on its own, which was a good choice. The flavor would be hard to notice as 'vegetable' if I didn't know, but they do have some flavor that's absent from regular crackers. 

The pizza was odd, but not offensive. Very dough-y and cheesy without any real sauce that would convince me it's pizza. Also quite dry, not helped when I got to the half with pepperoni. Some crushed red pepper saved this one, it's not bad but it's no Shredded BBQ Beef.

Pic 9 is the lemonade beverage base. Did a small portion and that was smart! Super tart and sickeningly sweet, but oddly refreshing. No real complaints here.

So a mixed menu. The main is weird and the standard cheese & chocolate drink mixes aren't my favorite, but the side and snacks were really good and in theory, complement one another well. I maybe won't be dreaming about the cookie quite like I do for the cran-raspberry First Strike bar, but they still did the trick on a dreary day.

As we actually meet I suggest coffee since we're 30 minutes late to the movie. So we go to the coffee shop, I take her and my order. I go to pay and now I don't have my debit card. I look through my pockets and nothing. Turns out later I left it at the first cinema when I got the refund. Since by then I would've been flustered and trying to make up time.

So two things happened,  I went to the wrong cinema and left my card there. Don't know how someone so simple becomes complicated.. I guess it was meant to be that way. I did apologise multiple times, saying that wasn’t the plan.",4,1768101791.0,dating,3,0.83,False

But recently I have been diving deep into the concept of Entropy for a video project and it honestly feels more spiritual than scientific.

We know the universe is dying (Heat Death). Entropy increases until everything fades away. But there is a theory by Roger Penrose called Cyclic Conformal Cosmology that suggests that once the universe is completely empty and ""dead,"" it effectively loses track of scale and time, which triggers a new Big Bang.

It basically implies that the universe goes through infinite cycles of death and rebirth. It forgets everything and starts over.

I made a breakdown of this on my channel Marsh Breaks It Down in a video called Why You Can’t Unmix Cream in Coffee. I mostly talk about the coffee mistake, but the end of the video gets into this idea that ""The End"" is actually just the start of the next cycle.

I know science and spirituality are usually kept separate, but does anyone else feel like advanced physics is just slowly rediscovering what spiritual traditions have said about ""Cycles"" for thousands of years?

This is just my dump account. I (F25) and my boyfriend (M24) have been in a relationship for almost a year. The problem is, I don’t see a future with him anymore. Should I break up with him?

Context:
I have a stable job and earn a five digit monthly salary which is more than enough for me since I’m not the breadwinner of my family. However, I do have my own financial obligations right now, so I can’t really help him financially and he has never asked me for help either. My boyfriend comes from a middle class family, but they went through major financial problems which forced him to stop college. He’s currently working as a kitchen staff at a popular coffee shop in Manila earning minimum wage he was just hired last november. I recently advised him to ask help from his sister because their situation has improved a bit she’s now working in the US. The help would’ve been for processing his requirements sana to work abroad (Taiwan) since he doesn’t even have a passport or a valid id yet. However, he always declines and says he’ll just save money on his own. He says he’s embarrassed to ask his sister for help because she already doesn’t force him to contribute to their household bills and their mother’s medication. His sister also has two children with special needs, so he doesn’t want to be an additional financial burden.
What bothers me is that he’s turning 25 this february, and he hasn’t really achieved anything yet. I find his mindset frustrating because he could pay his sister back eventually naman. Another issue is that a part of me feels ashamed that he’s my boyfriend. My friends don’t see anything wrong they saw him kasi once at the coffee shop and said his job is respectable and there’s nothing wrong with it. But I can’t help it. My pride gets in the way because the boyfriends of my friends are either working professionals or already abroad. He’s a nice boyfriend to begin with. He’s faithful, kind, generous, and a good cook honestly, he’s literal husband material. It’s really just his job that bothers me. Is what I’m feeling valid?

But recently I have been thinking about the Second Law of Thermodynamics and how it is basically the scientific proof for nihilism. We call it Entropy. It basically states that disorder always increases. I realized it while making coffee this morning because once you mix the cream in, the universe literally forbids you from unmixing it. You can never go back to the ordered state.

It is a small thing but it is the exact same mechanism that guarantees the sun will die and the universe will eventually end in Heat Death. It feels like the universe is rigged to erase everything eventually. Nature allows us to make a mess but never fix it.



I made a video essay for my channel Marsh Breaks It Down called Why You Can’t Unmix Cream in Coffee where I explain how this simple cup of coffee predicts the end of reality.

I am curious if you guys find comfort in the science of Heat Death or if it makes the whole ""nothing matters"" feeling worse?

1q9obsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q9obsw/the_oak_ridge_inheritance/,The Oak Ridge Inheritance,"On April 2nd, 1989, my Momma died in her sleep. She was 82 years old. My brother Benji found her lying on her back with her eyes closed. I found Benji screaming, hunched over her cold body and slapping her corpse, big fat tears running out his wide eyes as he pleaded with her to wake up. I calmed him down, told him I’d call the doc, and sent him to wait in his garden. The barn needed cleaning, so after the call I worked while I waited.

It rained the day we buried her, like something out of a movie. A dull gray rain that lingered and made you feel wet even beneath your umbrella. Benji’s tears were all spent by then though; he’d done his crying before the rains, where everyone could see it. He didn’t talk for twelve days straight after that, like back when he was a little. On the evening of the twelfth day, he up and told me he was gonna clean the barn tomorrow. When I got up the next day, I found him swinging from the rafters. I’d stepped outside for my morning coffee and a cigarette, and saw that the barn doors were still open. I crossed the small yard that lay between the farmhouse and barn, passing Benji’s garden along the way. He’d just planted a few days before Momma passed, and already growth was overtaking the small plot. For all his faults, at least he’d had a green thumb.

The barn smelled of hay and dried dung and old timber. The wood came from the forests that once grew around the property. Our family had long since cut and sold all the timber, starting all the way back when Grandpa acquired the land. We were some of the first to settle in these parts, and the barn was likely one of the oldest ones in the state. The wood from the forest was good and stiff, as sturdy as a man could ask for. Benji’s body was stiff as a board when I cut him down. He landed in the hay. It sounded like a bag of flour, a low, dull thud. He kicked up dust when he landed, dust that caught the morning light passing through the open barn doors. I sneezed as I climbed down the ladder and inhaled the dust. It got in my eyes and made them water. The dust made me cry.

I poured whiskey in my coffee as I waited for the ambulance to arrive. I waited for a good long while. Our property was way out in the boonies. Technically, it all passed to Benji when Momma died. It’s just mine now. Lily pawed at my knee as I sat waiting on the porch. She whimpered and stretched her jaw into a wide yawn. Her canines were sharp and yellow. Benji’s teeth never did come in right. The ambulance pulled up the dirt road and passed the “Welcome to Oak Ridge Farms” sign Benji and I had painted when we were children. I kept my hands in my jacket as the men approached. The responder wore his navy blues, and he had a lip swollen full with tobacco. His partner looked nervous. We spoke for a moment, then I led them into the barn.

“Why’d you cut him down?” The lead asked. His name was Rick, and I took him for the lead cause there was no way in hell the other guy was in charge.

“Couldn’t stand to leave him up there any longer,” I said.

“You really shouldn’t have moved him. The police’ll say it looks fishy.”

I shrugged my shoulders at that. It was far too late to worry about how it all looked. I stepped back outside for some air while the boys called for the ME.

About two hours later, I said goodbye to the ME as he drove off with my brother’s body. The police had their questions, sure, but I’d been drinking buddies with the chief for years. He knew me, he knew Momma, but most importantly, he knew Benji.

“Damn shame,” he’d said shortly after entering the barn.

My mind was on the cattle out in the pasture, and the wheat growing in the fields. It was almost time for harvest. I had things to get done.

“He show any… signs? Ever tell ya what was on his mind?”

I shook my head no. “All he said was that he was gonna go clean the barn in the morning. It was the first and last thing he’d said since Momma died.”

The chief sighed and shook his head, “Damn shame.”

I walked the chief out to his car. He rolled his window down before driving off.

“I know you’re going through a lot right now. Just… take some time. Swing by in a few days, and we’ll get the paperwork squared away. I’ll go ahead and let the county clerk know you’ll be by soon, for the property transfer, and the dissolution of that, er, what was it called again?”

“Conservatorship,” I said quietly. “I’ll be up later, get it taken care of.”

“Right. You take care now.”

I watched the chief pull away, his truck kicking up a trailing ribbon of dirt that spiraled into thin clouds before settling in the grass on the sides of the road. He’d had a look in his eye, hadn’t he? A queer one? The kinda look you give a thug or an out-of-towner, not a man who’s driven you home countless times after one too many. No, no, I must’ve imagined it. I stayed outside a moment, pacing the gravel, hands laced behind my head. Thinking, ignoring the sting of sweat on my rope-burnt palms.

The paperwork all went through, and I buried Benji beneath his garden. There was some debate with distant relatives who thought he should be next to Momma. I didn’t want to do that to her, despite it all. I made sure to keep the garden intact. It was a beautiful garden.

That year was the biggest harvest Oak Ridge Farms had ever seen. Stalks of wheat taller than a man, with full heads of grain. I managed to pay off all the funeral expenses that year, with plenty left afterwards. I met a nice girl from the town over that year as well. Her name was Patty. Patty baked and sold her goods down at the local farmers’ market. She used Oak Ridge wheat for her bread and sold out every time. People couldn’t get enough of it.

But whenever I ate it, all I tasted was ash.

The herd was hit with a case of spring fever that year as well. The vet couldn’t believe it. Neither could I. Every cow that year gave birth to twins. Some even had triplets, all of them healthy and strong. The vet said he’d never seen or even heard of such a thing. The herd grew and grew, all of ‘em fat and robust. Patty started selling their meat at the market as well. We could charge whatever we wanted, and people would pay it. That’s how good everyone said the cattle at Oak Ridge Farms were.

But whenever I ate it, no matter how long I made Patty grill it, all I could taste was raw flesh and blood.

I could handle the wheat. I could handle the cattle. But what I couldn’t handle, what no one could handle, was the garden. It seemed to grow with a mind of its own, spreading every year, no matter how often I fixed the fence or trimmed the plants. Patty didn’t think much of it. In fact, she enjoyed the garden and its bounty.

“Looks like Benji’s still helping out from beyond the grave, huh hun?” She’d say with a smile. “I sure do wish I could have met him. He sounds like such a kind soul.”

I’d nod my head, but inside I knew something was wrong. The tomatoes burst in my mouth like pimples. The cucumbers cracked like bone. I couldn’t eat any of it. I couldn’t eat. Patty prided herself on preparing for each meal only what the Lord had blessed our farm with. She scolded me when she found grease stains on my shirt, or empty bags and cups in my work truck. The fast stuff was all I could eat. All I could keep down.

The worst came a year after Benji’s death, on his anniversary. I’d stepped outside to eject the meal Patty had made. I had to, otherwise it would curdle in my stomach. She didn’t know any of this. God, she didn’t deserve any of this. I’d barely made it out the door and leaned over the porch railing. I vomited right on top of Benji’s grave.

It was then I noticed the roses. They were magnificent; large flowers of deep lavender grew all across the garden. They grew as I watched, their petals blossoming, their thorns stretching longer and longer. I threw up again, and again. Their smell, their stench, was overwhelming. Like a field hit with blight. Like a dead cow left to rot beneath the sun. Like Benji’s room when he’d have an accident and Momma would ask me to help her clean it up.

In that moment, I waited for Benji. I knew he was coming. I knew I was about to pay for what I’d done. But damn it all, it was my farm. It was always supposed to be my farm. Why hadn’t she trusted me? Of course I was gonna take care of him; as if I’d abandon my only brother. To do that to me, to strip away all I had worked for and give it to an imbecile… what was she thinking? What choice did she leave me? My tears mixed with the bile staining Benji’s headstone as I waited for the roses to take me. I felt their petals lick my skin like the barbed tongue of the Devil himself. Those thorns inched near the crown of my head, and I prepared myself to die a wicked man, damned by my wronged brother, beneath the eyes of a just God.

Only Death never came. He whispered from the bushes. His voice laughed in the wind. But he never showed his face. The roses retreated, the thorns scratching my skin as they went, but leaving me otherwise unharmed. Patty found me there in the morning. My clothes were soaked with sweat, and she said I was shivering like I’d been out in a winter storm. I don’t remember any of it.

I still can’t eat the food. I take no joy in the fruit of my labor. But I no longer care.

Because there was another voice that night apart from Death’s.

And it said,

I'm living in El Cerrito but I know there's little to no chance of finding something like this around here.  I'm hoping there may be someplace in Berkeley/S. Richmond area.  I'd probably drive further if it were worth it.

Thanks in advance.

I kept seeing posts about how hard it is to make friends in NZ. Those posts actually inspired me to do something about it.

I coded this website over the weekend, it’s called **YouKeen?** Just like it sounds, if you have a plan, you just shout it out to see if anyone nearby is keen to join. You can use it to find someone for a walk or a coffee. It's purely designed for casual hangouts, not formal networking or big community gatherings like in Meetup.

It is **100% free** and just a passion project to help kill loneliness in NZ. It's an MVP, so it might be a little rough around the edges, but I'd love for you to give it a go!

Shoutout what you’re doing. There’s always someone keen.

All these guys would talk about her but nobody ever asked her out but him, which he was really shocked about.

I’m wondering how similar this is with guys. Are there a lot of really hot and attractive guys who just never get asked for coffee or complimented? Or maybe don’t even realise how good looking they are? I feel like the scale is a bit wonky, I feel like some women can feel very insecure about their appearance and not realise they’re attractive, but I feel like guys who are attractive, know it and are more picky about the women they date and who approaches them, how true do you guys agree? 

I want to start approaching guys i find really attractive but I often end up with the average friend because I feel more comfortable, however I’m curious to how well it would go? Do they get hit on less? I feel like I’m more likely to get rejected ",10,1768100961.0,AskMenAdvice,37,0.81,False

1q9o3bf,https://v.redd.it/crvta2j0zmcg1,Coffee + Lemon Every Day: Wellness Boost or Health Myth?,"Coffee with lemon has become a trendy morning ritual, often praised for fat-burning, digestion, and detox benefits. 

www.healthempowersyou.net 

While this combo can offer a few perks, it’s not the miracle drink social media makes it out to be. Here’s a clear, science-backed look at what actually happens to your body if you drink coffee and lemon every day, both the good and the caution.

What Happens to Your Body:

Boosts alertness & metabolism – Caffeine increases focus and may slightly raise metabolic rate

Supports digestion – Lemon stimulates stomach acid, which can help digestion for some people

Provides antioxidants – Coffee and lemon both contain compounds that help fight oxidative stress

May reduce appetite temporarily – Caffeine can suppress hunger short term (not a fat-loss solution)

Can irritate the stomach – Acid + caffeine may worsen acid reflux or stomach sensitivity

Not a detox – Your liver and kidneys already detox your body—this drink doesn’t replace them

Dental enamel risk – Lemon’s acidity can weaken tooth enamel over time if consumed daily

Bottom Line:

Coffee with lemon isn’t harmful for most people in moderation, but it’s not a weight-loss or detox magic drink. If you enjoy it, drink it smart, rinse your mouth with water after and avoid it on an empty stomach if you’re sensitive.

Some neighbors denounced strange people lurking outside their windows, sometimes even in the backyard. Some of these stalkers were aggressive, and tried to break windows open with their heads; other were totally naked and tried to climb the roof top of some houses, in order to get inside through the chimney. A big number of those calls came around 10 A.M., when most people supposed to go to work and kids to school, so all those events were odd to the authorities. Were an army of crazy people taking over the little forgotten town of Barton? Or it was some case of mass hysteria?

The first house the police approached was number 23 in G. Mathewson Avenue. The street was quiet and empty that morning. The house seemed dead.

From other houses along Mathewson Ave., residents tried to call the officers through the windows, making signs with their hands or shaking their arms, like there was something horrible outside to worry about, to the point they couldn’t get out even to the porch, and said it out loud.

After they arrived to the house, the police found a whole family, mom and dad ready for a day in the office, and all three kids dressed up for school, looking at them through the large crystal pane of the house’s main window.

Officer George Stevenson was the one who rang the bell.

“Morning, officer,” said a voice behind the door.

“Good morning, Sir. Had you call the police?”

“Yes, yes! I did. There’s a naked man walking around the house. And, well, I don’t know how to put it, officer, but he carries…,” said the voice.

“Carries what?” asked Stevenson.

The voice went shut for a moment, but Stevenson thought he could hear the man asking to somebody (maybe his wife), to take the children to some other room.

“Sir?”

“The man…, this lunatic was carrying the dead body of Mr, Churchill, our pet, all bloody, with its insides hanging out.” The voice stopped to take a breath, “out of its belly.”

“All right, sorry to hear it,” said Stevenson. “What’s your name, sir.”

“Anthony Hecker”, said the voice.

“Can you open the door, Mr. Hecker?”

“What for?”

“Well, to check everything inside the property is fine, and that you are fine.”

“We are,” said Mr. Hecker. “Nobody’s hurt. He didn’t get inside, yet.”

“Yet?”

“But he will, if you don’t stop him.”

“Exactly, but how can we stop him if…”

A loud sound came from somewhere no far. The sound of the patrol car’s door closing behind him, made Stevenson to turn. His partner was outside the patrol, after noticing something odd.

“He’s outside,” said the invisible Mr. Hecker. “Not here. He’s in the backyard, doing… stuff.”

“What you mean with *stuff*?”

When the officers crossed the open wooden slat-fence, they found dried trails of something dark on the lawn, smelling just like blood. Stevenson unholstered his pistol when he saw the tiny pieces of rotten meat here and there. The sound of steps came from the roof. It is not in any report, for little interest that make to the cause of the jury, but is a mystery what both men felt when they actually saw “it”, saw the actual thing before their eyes.

It was a naked man, just like Mr. Hecker described. His skin was terrible pale, contrasting with the big stain of blood covering his chest. He was grabbing some kind of animal of gray fur, and he made disgusting dry clatter while biting the almost naked skull of his victim. Some of the internal organs of the animal were scattered on the brown roof, over a big trail of dark blood. Some little crows were sticking their black peaks on the meat.

“Mother of God!” said Stevenson, and his voice was almost a whisper.

“Police!” shouted Keller, Stevenson’s partner. “You get down of there right now!”

The naked man turned his face down toward them. Half of it was gone, and his left eye, or better say what was left of it, hanged from the dark hole of his eye socket. He didn’t say a thing, but stopped biting the animal’ skull and opened his mouth, sticking out his red tongue.

“Jesus, he’s nuts,” said Keller “We better call an ambulance, right? They gonna have to sedate this bastard before gettin’ him into a ward”.

Keller grabbed the radio on his chest and asked for medical assistance, but couldn’t finish the message.

Stevenson felt the heavy weight of his slim body as he landed on the bloody lawn. He’d never forget the sound the bones made were they broke, almost as wood cracking. And he was right there, right over his partner. It all happened so fast. His calves exploded like two *piñatas* with meat and bones instead of sweets, but he was still fighting against Keller.

Stevenson did nothing about it. He was frozen, and his pistol hanged useless from his right hand. The naked man was biting his partner’s neck, and chewing the pink raw meat, while the other was bleeding to death. He stared at Stevenson with wide eyes, pleading him to do something, to help him. But after his trembling hands fell to the sides, it was all over for him.

Stevenson later said it was like a dream. He took his time to look at the big dead dog, no far from where he was standing still. The gray fur was over the grass, like a piece of cloth, almost completely separated from the dog’s body. The pinkish ribs and skull were exposed, stained with red lumps. He saw the kids taking polaroids the whole thing through the kitchen window, but he didn’t care. Hell, the son of a bitch was hungry. He was grabbing his partner head with his bloody claws (his left forearm was destroyed, maybe were the dog may had bite him in self-defense). It kept biting Keller’s face off his skull, in silence, without even breathing.

Keller wasn’t dead.

“Oh, oh,” he said, out of fight, as the naked man won access to the meat under his skin, yellow little teeth grabbing purple-red meat from under his eye, ripping it off a bite at a time, leaving open patches of white bone exposed.

“Oh, oh,” said Keller, his voice dying in between his blood sunken lips.

In just a second, fresh blood, crimson bright, covered Keller features like a silk vale. Two little pools formed down, looking orange over the dark grass.

Stevenson holstered his pistol and walked away from the scene. There wasn’t much to do there, he thought. He walked down the road, like a lost soul, and people here and there, screaming, shooting their shotguns to other people (people that were crazy), and a lot of patrols were coming this way, but Stevenson didn’t flinched, kept walking like a possessed body in the yellow line of the asphalt. Police cars had to turn around him, to avoid kill him. Some of his partners shouted things at him, but he didn’t hear them. There was a cloud in his head about it.

Poor officer Stevenson walked six miles back home. His wife asked him if everything was okay, but he didn’t answer. He went upstairs, to the marital bedroom, took off his police hat, and laid on the bed for hours, without sleeping. His wife found him staring at the ceiling, so she called an ambulance.

When they asked about it, Stevenson said nothing. He couldn’t talk for months, not even a word.



\*\*\*



People in town started calling the assaulters “the maniacs”, as question arose about whatever they escaped from a psychiatric institution, or even worst, from a maximum security detention facility, or this or that. Some folks even claimed it was a secret project conducted by the CIA, but the TV’s news didn’t say anything about a government black agenda, or real manias walking freely in the state of Michigan, as it happens in New York’ streets every day, asking for some change or maybe a cigarette. The TV’s news just limited to cover the short scene, and the twenty or something innocent victims (including police officers and children).

Areal images of G. Mathewson Avenue, being invaded by a few ambulances, maybe more than a few of the MCPD’s patrol cars, and even a large fire truck blocking the road, were transmitted on every TV across the United Sates that day. A sexy female voice narrated the context, just in case somebody watching the news was blind, stupid or couldn’t believe her own eyes. Police running here and there; the paramedics taking injured people over stretchers; and the sexy voice of the female reporter interrupting the horror tale just to ask “it’s that the sound of gunshots? Are you hearing that too, Larry?”

There wasn’t much people living in Barton at the time. Around 800 souls or so. Again, not so many people, but still some got angry when police decided to block the access to the road 55 from the main city.

Authorities kept working in the area till evening, and people watching the news still didn’t know what was coming on. It was real? It was a terrorist attack? The army and Special Forces secured the access to the area, and almost everybody in town was evacuated. The White House asked all TV’s news channels to stop the live transmission of the military operation in that town. Of course, that didn’t make matters any better, speaking of people peace of mind.

 

An operative of the Special Forces of the Michigan Police, was conducted the next morning after the aforementioned events. It was supposed the army would give them cover.

Two black trucks arrived to G. Mathewson Avenue, outside of the police security perimeter. A man in a black uniform got down from one of them; it was Captain Stewart from the Michigan Special Operations Division. In each truck there was an emergency support squad of eight men.

The plan was to rescue any hostage, if there was any, secure the perimeter and clear every house alongside Mathewson Ave.

Around 00:00 of that same day of August, the operative “Medusa” started. A police helicopter flew over the little houses, giving technical support to the ground team. Most of the streets seemed under control, so far.

One SOD squad went at the number 15^(th), the first house to be evacuated in the area. That house was empty, except for a cat. The second squad entered the next house, number 16^(th), and found an elderly couple, still sleeping in bed. They never knew what was going on. They continued this procedure until property number 20, in a time span of an hour.

In house number 20, they found nobody in either floor, so the officers decided to go down stairs, to the cellar. There was no light there, so most of the walk took place in the dark, lighting the cement stairs with their flashlights. Between all the dirty junk there was a little empty spot in one corner, near a door. There was somebody crouching, giving his back to the officers.

“Police! To the ground, NOW!”

According to officer John Oates’ report, one of the members of the Michigan SOD squad present that day, it was a kid, of around 7 or 8. He was wearing only shorts, and his skin was really pale.

“Hey, boss,” somebody muttered to Captain Stewart, “is just a kid.”

“Son, show your hands!” shouted Stewart.

But the boy didn’t react. All flashlights beams were over his bonny back, and his short blonde hair, but he remained quiet.

Stewart made a gesture, and other two officers went up front, checking the place out with their lights.

“Son, can you hear me? Son?”

The boy stood up, and he was clutching something in one hand. Something red.

“What’s in his hand?” asked one squad officer.

“That’s right, champ,” said Stewart. “Hands up and walk backwards. You’re safe.”

The child raised both hands, as instructed, but stood right where he was. Captain Stewart didn’t wait. He stepped front to grab him.

“Shit,” one man said. “Is that a dead rat in his hand?”

Before the Captain could put one gloved hand over the little boy’s shoulder, he jumped high up like a real frog, quicker than a thought, and vanished from the light. Stewart kept in that position for a moment, his right hand in the air, still waiting to grab a bony shoulder. Slowly, he went back to his martial guard, and pointed his light to the ceiling. The boy was there, between two wooden beams, buried all four in shadows and a mist of cobwebs.

From that position, the boy «*twisted his head»*, in Oates words, to look down at the team.

“His face was empty,” Oates stated in the report, “no emotions. Just his dead bulging eyes in his dead mask, and his little lips, damp with blood and saliva. He was like under hypnosis or something, it was quite strange, really. I never saw something like it, especially in a kid his age.”

Nobody said or did anything, and the child crawled away. Some of the members of the team lost their focus, and started to look for the boy in every corner of the ceiling.

“Jesus… Where he is?”

“Get out of there, kiddo!”

“Lost him, boss”

“Keep it together, boys,” said Stewart. “Let’s move. C’mon!”

They did. There was a metal door before them. Stewart hesitated a second, but he kicked it open.

The rest is a big confusion.

Some described something horrible coming out of that room, as being the reason why they opened fired at the same time. Oates said he saw a lot of white hands grabbing Stewart by the vest. Whatever happened there, all eight members of the squad, less their Captain, ran upstairs. One of them dropped a flash-bang grenade to the basement, before closing the door.

The house number 20 was sealed. Somebody asked about Cap. Stewart, of course. “He’s dead” was the answer, and there was no doubt about it. Killed by his own men in a friendly crossfire.

That moment the mission stopped for an hour. As stated later by officer Daryl Hall, Michigan SOD, “we felt lost.”

 

Sergeant Joaquin Torres, who was monitoring the mission from inside a truck, assumed the command of Steward’ squad. House 20, belonged to Adams family, was guarded by military infantry, while the next house, number 21, was registered by a second SOD squad. After finding nothing strange going on there, they went to the next house, while the other squad registered the number 22, and found just a couple dogs chained in the backyard, but no human beings.

Inside house 23, they found the aftermath of carnage. The officer down, Charles Keller, was left dead over the lawn. His nose was bitten off. On the left side of his face, the cheekbones were visible in between lumps of pinkish gristle and cracked dark blood. Of his neck, only the clean cervical vertebrae were all they found. Torres knelt near the body, and scared away the little crows over his chest. It was a terrible show, watching poor officer Keller like that. He was 44 and had two daughters.

There were two long bloody trails that lead toward the fence. The aggressor’s trace was an irregular splatter of dark dried blood, meaning he couldn’t walk and had to drag himself over the lawn.

Inside the house, all objects remained where they should. Some flies flew over the breakfast table. Two coffee cups, three orange juice glasses for the kids, and bread slices with melted butter and a jar of strawberry jam were still in place, clues left behind by the departing family. The TV still on, with muttered sound, showing the live cover of the mission the SOD squad was carrying on, regardless of the pleads from the White House.

It was 5:24 when the operative finished, and the town was more or less secured. The only thing left to do was find the many “maniacs” the calls talked about, but most of them where probably hiding in the dark basement of the house number 20.

At 6:30, the SOD was still there, watching over the town. A soldier voice called for a woman walking the road toward them.

“Stop! Don’t move!” the soldier’s voice shouted through the bullhorn. “This is a military protected perimeter! This is a warning! Stop where you are!”

But the woman didn’t stop.

As stated by officer Oates, she was around 50, long gray hair fell loose over her shoulders. She was wearing a dirty Led’s Zepellin shirt, gray panties and socks, with no shoes. She seemed lost and confused, like a drunken person. Her hands were folded on her chest, and she moved her legs in a strange fashion, with one foot being faster than the other. It wasn’t dark, but two powerful search lights illuminated the road, and painted the woman’s face with spectral shine. But as Oates later said, she didn’t even blink, neither stop her weird pace toward the armed men.

“Stop, don’t move!” insisted the metal voice. “Last warning!”

The first bullet made a hole on the asphalt, three feet right in front of the woman.

No effect at all. The woman kept walking like nothing happened.

“Don’t move! I repeat, don’t move!”

The SOD squad got into martial guard, aiming their MP5 at the woman.

The next spray of bullets almost touched the woman’s feet. And, like a magic spell, she stopped.

“Get down! To the ground!” ordered the metal voice.

Two soldiers came running out of the line, and stood in front of the woman, aiming their rifles right at her head.

“Show me your hand, miss,” said one.

“Can you hear me? Are you okay?” said the other. “This is a not a joke, get to the ground now, and show both hands.”

The woman stood there, quiet. The metallic voice was still barking through the bullhorn, when one of the soldiers put down his rifle and step forward.

“To the ground!”

“Don’t touch her!” a voice shouted behind him. It was one of Oates’ team mates.

“It’s one of them! Don’t trust her!”

The soldier didn’t turn, but he didn’t advance either. In a gesture of doubt, his right arm stood in the air, useless. After a moment, the soldier exhaled and stepped forward, his open hand aiming to the woman shoulder.

In that second, the woman opened up her arms, moved back her head, and exposed her bulging abdomen. A red line began to open as the pale skin separated, showing yellow layers of fat, but also a chaos of bloody lines, and something white and tubular. It was too fast. They were tentacles, thin and red little tentacles, made out of raw, bloody human flesh. They caught the soldier’s right arm in a firm grip.

“What the - -,“ said the soldier, resisting the bloody embrace of the tentacle.

The woman’s torso fell behind, as her body divided in two halves, showing her internal organs and lots of bonny thin needles, like fangs, sticking out of fatty lips.

“Whatta fuck! Whatta fuck, man!” said the soldier, resisting the strength that tried to pull him forward.

Even as he made his best to stay his ground, a temblor travel down his legs. He screamed, and raised his rifle with his free hand to open fire. The rifle flew from his hand, as the bullets destroyed the woman’s thoracic cavity, cutting rib bones through pale skin.

“Yo’, don’t shot, don’t shot,” said another soldier to his partners, “you may hurt him too!”

“Help!” said the soldier (his real identity unknown, for everything that happened that day in Barton it classified as top secret). “She’s grabbing my fucking arm. I can’t move away!”

Officer Oates admitted being terrified witnessing the struggle, and felt impotent about it. He recalled that soldier being too young to be there, and the look on his eyes was something he may never forget. The helpless state of horror inside his mind was reflected on his blue eyes.

“Oh, my god, bitch!” where the last words of that soldier, according to some, when ‘the thing’ pulled him so close, he had to raise his leg to keep the distance.

He also grabbed his Colt M1911 and shot the creature inside its gruesome mouth. Some of its fangs flew away, bits of flesh and blood covered the asphalt. But nothing changed, the creature kept pulling him in. When he ran out of bullet, he used the pistol handle as a hammer and smashed that mess of organs and bones that was trying to eat him alive. After throwing the pistol inside its meaty cave, he took out his hunter knife and tried to cut the tentacle. Something like a pain shriek was heard. He did free himself and fell on his back, but more tentacles, around three or four, came out and grabbed his legs, and even if kept using his knife, it was too late. Half his body was inside that disgusting mouth conformed of human flesh. Those nightmarish jaws closed on his legs.

A gray mist elevated over the road, when the soldiers fired at the same time, without caring about orders. Maybe more than ten M16 rifles covered the woman, or the creature for the matter, in a shower of bullets that penetrated almost every part and organ in her body. Blood rained where she was standing.

When the black mist dissipated, everybody could see something that has no sense, regardless of what has happened before.

From starter, it seemed that the top half of the woman was nowhere to be seen, and only the lower part of her still remained, with those red meaty worms coming from the center of her spine, still squeezing the fractured soldier legs, half way deep in a pinkish soup of blown intestines and blood, and two fat legs, covered in holes, that gave it support. Most of sharpen bone shivers, its *fangs*, of different sizes, were still in place, somewhere between the woman’s hips bones and lower ribs. Some said they were like shark teeth, as some new fangs grown from the empty spaces were others were blown off. Oates remembers the upper half of the woman’s body, her torso, behind her legs, palms on the ground, giving stability to her legs, and the gray hair of her head hanging like some sort of hairy tail as some kind of hell’s mock of a four legs animal. The open hole of her abdominal cavity, a hungry monstrous mouth, not giving up in her intend to rip off the soldier broken and blood-soaked legs, closed with strength, making a crack sound, cutting off both of the young soldier legs at the knees.

The thing was bleeding a lot, and according to Oates, it smelled disgusting, like human feces probably due to the damaged intestines, but it didn’t die.

The soldier wasn’t moving at all, and didn’t react when his legs were severed.

No one in that company remember how many soldiers shot at the same time, or how many times they fired.

Oates saw his own sub-rifle shooting. He couldn’t resist the desire of destroying that lethal abomination. When the many guns stopped spitting fire, Oates remembered hearing the monkey shriek again, and something like a long white slug bursting out from the sickening chaos of blood and human organs, sliding quicker than any kind of viper he ever saw in real life or in TV. It hid in a big rosebush on the side of the road.

Oates admitted later than, in that moment, it wasn’t important to him, and that he was probably the only one to noticed it, but he never could figure out what it was, or what relevance it had in the mutation of the woman.

After that wild rampage of bullets, the beast collapsed, its almost human structure was a disorder of human skin, orange fat mixed with lumps of flesh of different colors, grey hair and many bones sticking out from holes, over a dark crimson pool blood. It was, as Oates described, “If you’d put a body through a grinder machine”.

That unrecognizable heap of meat, stood there for quite a moment, and the people who killed it, kept aiming their guns at it the whole time. After a few minutes, when flies and other insects surrounded it, a brave doctor came close, examined the lumps of many things, and established the thing was well dead. As well as legless soldier, God bless him forever.

All this was later dismissed by the White House Information Department, the FBI and the Agency of Defense, and even the CNN. Of course, the stories became known in all magazines and newspapers across America, but it was so incredible, so grotesque, that soon all of it was no more real than the UFO sightings in Roswell or the Big Foot in Louisiana.

 

That same day, most of the forces were taken back, and that particular town in Michigan became protected and under surveillance by the army. All documents, tales and evidence about this episode were hidden as top secret business, and all shown by the media was ignore by the authorities.

Lots of theories came to play their part in this succession of events, but for most people everything was a just a hoax. Almost everybody eventually forgot all about that affair, even after the many books, movies and video games created based on it.

But not everybody forgets that easy, specially the sleepless witnesses.

If your ideal Saturday is waking up and staying in bed with me far longer than we should, OD on caffeine (iced coffee is always superior to hot, even in the winter), and then we game all day together while chomping on snacks.. you might be the one. Are you down for some cringe side by side PC setups type ish or what?

I’m into sassy nerds/weirdos with pretty eyes, pop punk vibes and chaotic energy. My tastes are pretty much up in the air though. I like everything from Aubrey Plaza RBF energy to the apologize to inanimate objects and can’t ask for extra sauce types. Freckles are a plus but not a necessity. Personality does hold a heavier hand in my decision but obviously physical attraction is very important too.

Chapter 1
Our Spot

The hall lights in the orphanage buzz like they’re trying to whisper secrets to each other. It’s late—way past lights out—but that’s never stopped me before. I’ve gotten pretty good at timing my steps between the squeaky parts of the floorboards. Perks of living somewhere long enough to map out every noise.

The place isn’t bad, really. It’s old, sure—peeling paint, crooked picture frames, the occasional smell of ancient carpet—but it’s home. Or, I guess, the closest thing I’ve got to one.

I pause by the corner room, listen for the night attendant’s footsteps, and when the coast is clear, I tap twice on the window next to me.

Two knocks back. That’s Kayla.

She slides it open just enough for her face to peek through, brown hair messy from the cheap pillow she’s supposed to be asleep on. She grins. “You’re late.”

“I was fashionably delayed,” I whisper. “Also, the bathroom light flickered again. I think the ghost’s back.”

She rolls her eyes, pushing the window up wider so I can climb in. “You’re ridiculous.”

“Yeah, but admit it—you missed me.”

Kayla smirks but doesn’t answer, turning to grab the small backpack from her bed. I spot the old blanket and the mini portable DVD player sticking out of it. “Got the goods?” I ask.

“Obviously. You think I’d let movie night die?”

We sneak down the hall together, keeping low and quiet. She’s better at it than me—lighter on her feet—but I’ve got a talent for timing doors so they don’t creak. The two of us have been doing this for years now. It’s like a ritual.

The window at the end of the hall creaks open to the small fire escape. Cold air hits my face, sharp and freeing. From there, it’s a quick climb up to the roof—our roof. The place nobody else knows about.

Kayla gets up first, I follow. The city stretches out below, washed in streetlights and the hum of traffic. We’ve got a couple of beanbags we dragged up here last summer, a busted TV stand we use as a table, and a string of half-dead fairy lights powered by an extension cord that somehow hasn’t killed us yet.

Kayla plops down and digs through the backpack. “Okay, movie choices tonight are: The Iron Giant… or The Princess Bride.”

I pretend to think. “Hmm. Giant robot sacrifices itself for humanity, or a guy in a mask doing acrobatics and sword fights? Totally not relatable at all.”

She laughs. “You’re impossible. We’re watching The Princess Bride.”

I groan dramatically. “Fine, but only if I get to quote the villain.”

“You always do.”

We settle in under the blanket, the DVD player flickering to life with its little whine. The sound of distant cars mixes with the faint laughter from the screen.

For a while, it’s easy to forget we’re orphans. Easy to pretend this rooftop is our whole world—just us, bad movies, and a city that doesn’t care enough to notice.

I glance at Kayla, her face lit by the glow of the screen, and catch myself smiling.

Yeah. Nights like this almost make the world feel okay.
Halfway through the movie, Kayla’s quoting every line. She always does.
It’s funny—she’s so into it, mouthing along like she’s part of the story, like she actually believes in fairy tales and happy endings.

Me? I’m just watching this masked guy in tights let the villain live for the fifth time and starting to lose it.

I sigh. “You know what I don’t get?”

Kayla pauses the movie mid-sword fight, raising an eyebrow. “What now, Mr. Cynical?”

“Why doesn’t he just… finish the guy?” I say, gesturing at the frozen frame of the villain sneering on-screen. “He knows he’s gonna cause more trouble later. Just—end it. Done. No sequel.”

She stares at me for a second like I just said something in another language.
“That’s… kind of dark, Griff.”

I shrug. “I’m just saying. If the bad guy’s gonna come back and hurt more people, what’s the point of sparing him? You stop the problem at the source. Makes sense.”

Kayla shakes her head, her expression softening like she’s heard this before. “You sound like one of those edgy comic book villains who think they’re doing the right thing.”

“I’m just being realistic.”

“No,” she says, nudging my shoulder, “you’re being heartless.”

Her tone isn’t mean, though—it’s calm, like she’s trying to teach me something without making it a lecture. “All life means something, even the bad ones. If you cross that line once, you won’t stop. You’ll start deciding who deserves to live and who doesn’t.”

I roll my eyes, but I don’t say anything. She keeps going.

“Heroes save people. That’s what makes them heroes. They don’t decide who’s worth saving. They just… do it.”

The words hang there, and for a second, the only sound is the faint wind brushing past the rooftop edge.

I finally mutter, “Maybe I don’t wanna be a hero, then.”

Kayla looks at me, surprised, and then smiles that same annoying, patient smile. “You already are, Griffin. You just don’t see it yet.”

I look away. The city’s lights blur together, orange and gold, and for a moment, I want to believe her. I really do.

She presses play again, resting her head against my shoulder. I pretend not to care, but my chest feels warm.

Maybe she’s right.
Or maybe she’s just too good for a world like this.

At some point during the movie, my eyes got heavy. I remember Kayla laughing at something stupid I said, and then… nothing. Just the sound of rain tapping against the attic roof.

When I wake up, my neck hurts like hell and the old TV’s blue screen is still glowing faintly in the dark. Kayla’s asleep next to me, curled up in her oversized hoodie, one hand still clutching the remote like she won some kind of victory.

It’s quiet—too quiet—until I hear it.

“Kayla? Griffin?!”

The voice echoes up from the main hall. Then another joins in, sharper. “If you two are hiding again, I swear—”

Kayla stirs, groggy. “…What time is it?”

I glance at the tiny clock we’ve duct-taped to the wall. “Uh, way past when we were supposed to be in our rooms.”

Her eyes widen, and she sits up so fast she almost knocks over the popcorn bowl. “Oh no. Oh no no no. Mrs. Dorian’s gonna kill us.”

I grin. “If she hasn’t already.”

We scramble to clean up—blankets tossed in the corner, movie still paused mid-frame, lights out. Our little hideaway suddenly feels like a crime scene.

The voices downstairs get closer. “They have to be somewhere in this building!”

Kayla bites her lip. “Window exit?”

I shake my head. “Too risky. You’re not stealthy enough.”

“Excuse me?”

I smirk, whispering, “You trip over air, Kayla.”

She glares, but she’s trying not to laugh. “Fine. Then you lead, genius.”

We crawl through the narrow attic passage, dust clinging to our sleeves. My heart’s thudding—not because we’re in trouble, but because sneaking around like this always makes me feel alive.

By the time we drop down behind the library door, we can hear the head attendant pacing the hall. Kayla wipes her hands on her jeans, trying to look innocent, while I casually stroll out like I just woke up.

“There you two are!” Mrs. Dorian snaps, crossing her arms. “Where have you been?”

I yawn dramatically. “Uh… sleeping? Where else?”

Her brow furrows. “Don’t get smart with me, Griffin Harris. You weren’t in your rooms.”

“Then maybe you should check your glasses,” I say, motioning toward our shared dorm room. “We’ve been there all night. How’d you not see us?”

Kayla elbows me, whispering, “You’re gonna get us both grounded.”

I flash a grin. “We already are.”

Mrs. Dorian narrows her eyes, sighs, and finally mutters, “Breakfast. Five minutes. Don’t be late again.”

As soon as she turns the corner, Kayla exhales and smacks my arm lightly. “You’re impossible.”

“Maybe,” I say, rubbing the spot where she hit me, “but admit it—you’d be bored without me.”

She rolls her eyes, but she’s smiling. “Unfortunately, you’re probably right.”

We head toward the cafeteria, the smell of burnt toast and bad coffee filling the halls. Just another morning at St. Anselm’s Orphanage.

I feel like the standard way we introduce the Second Law of Thermodynamics to people is slightly misleading.

We almost always use the ""messy room"" analogy. You know the one where we say your room gets messy easily but it takes energy to clean it. It is intuitive but I feel like it misses the existential weight of the concept. It makes entropy sound like a chore rather than a fundamental law of reality. I was making coffee recently and realized the ""mixing"" analogy is so much better. Once you pour the cream you can never take it back. It captures the irreversibility and the arrow of time in a way that a messy room just does not. The universe literally forbids you from unmixing it.



I actually just started a YouTube channel called Marsh Breaks It Down to try and explain these concepts without stripping away the nuance. My first real attempt is a video called Why You Can’t Unmix Cream in Coffee where I try to connect that simple morning mistake to the eventual heat death of the universe.

I am curious what analogies you guys prefer when people ask you to explain entropy. Do you stick to the disorder definition or do you try to explain microstates and statistics?

Started with Andrew Huberman's podcast, then moved to Peter Attia, Matthew Walker's book, and honestly? I'm kind of pissed no one explained this stuff earlier. We spend a third of our lives sleeping but most of us treat it like an afterthought.

The thing is, bad sleep isn't just about feeling groggy. It tanks your testosterone, makes you store fat easier, kills your ability to build muscle, and literally makes you dumber. Your brain needs sleep to clear out metabolic waste. Without it, you're essentially trying to run your life on a clogged system.

Here's what actually works, backed by research and not just wellness influencer BS.

# 1. Light exposure is everything

Your circadian rhythm runs on light cues. Dr. Attia and pretty much every sleep researcher agrees, getting bright light in your eyes within 30 minutes of waking is non negotiable. It sets your cortisol spike at the right time and programs when melatonin gets released later.

Go outside for 10 minutes. No sunglasses. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light is significantly stronger than indoor lighting. If you live somewhere dark half the year, get a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp.

At night, dim everything 2-3 hours before bed. Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin production. Those blue light glasses actually help, or just use Night Shift mode on your devices. Better yet, read an actual book.

# 2. Temperature matters way more than you think

Your core body temperature needs to drop about 2-3 degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep. This is why hot bedrooms wreck your sleep quality.

Keep your room between 65-68°F. Sounds cold but your body needs it. If you're a hot sleeper, get a ChiliPad or Ooler sleep system. They actively cool your mattress and the difference is insane. I was skeptical about dropping $500 on a mattress pad but it's genuinely been one of the best purchases I've made.

Take a hot shower or bath 60-90 minutes before bed. Counterintuitive, but when you get out, your body temperature drops rapidly, which triggers sleepiness.

# 3. Magnesium supplementation

Most people are deficient in magnesium and don't know it. It helps with muscle relaxation and GABA production, which calms your nervous system.

Dr. Attia recommends magnesium L-threonate or glycinate, not magnesium oxide which just gives you diarrhea. Take 400-500mg about an hour before bed. I use Momentous Sleep Pack which also includes L-theanine and apigenin. The combo genuinely helps me fall asleep faster and stay asleep.

# 4. Caffeine has a 6 hour half life

This one hurt me personally because I used to drink coffee at 3pm. Even if you fall asleep fine, caffeine blocks adenosine receptors and fragments your deep sleep stages.

Cut off caffeine by 2pm latest. If you need an afternoon boost, try a 20 minute power nap instead. Or just accept that you're tired because you're supposed to be and go to bed earlier.

# 5. Consistent sleep and wake times

Your body loves consistency. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even weekends, reinforces your circadian rhythm.

I started using the Whoop strap to track my sleep stages and recovery. It's honestly kind of eye opening seeing how much your choices affect your sleep quality. Also shows you how alcohol absolutely destroys REM sleep, even just one drink.

If tracking sounds too intense, just set two alarms. One for when you should start winding down, one for when you should actually be in bed.

# 6. The 10-3-2-1-0 rule

Stole this from someone smarter than me but it works. 10 hours before bed, no more caffeine. 3 hours before bed, no more food or alcohol. 2 hours before bed, no more work. 1 hour before bed, no more screens. 0 times you hit snooze in the morning.

Food close to bedtime spikes your insulin and raises core body temperature. Both mess with sleep quality. Alcohol might make you pass out but it prevents you from getting restorative deep sleep and REM.

# 7. Sleep hygiene basics everyone ignores

Blackout curtains. Seriously, any light in your room suppresses melatonin. Cover up those annoying LED lights on electronics with black tape.

White noise machine or earpilot earplugs. Environmental noise, even if it doesn't wake you, fragments your sleep architecture.

Reserve your bed for sleep and sex only. Don't work in bed, don't scroll TikTok in bed. Train your brain that bed means sleep.

If you can't fall asleep after 20 minutes, get up and do something boring in dim light until you feel sleepy. Don't just lay there stressing about not sleeping.

# The book that changed how I think about sleep

Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker. He's a neuroscientist at UC Berkeley and this book is loaded with research on how sleep affects literally every aspect of your health. Memory consolidation, immune function, emotional regulation, longevity. All of it.

Fair warning, you'll probably get anxious reading it because you'll realize how badly you've been screwing yourself over. But that anxiety is useful if it motivates you to actually prioritize sleep.

Another resource worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books like Walker's to create personalized audio content on sleep science and other topics. Built by Columbia grads and ex-Google engineers, it lets you customize everything from episode length (quick 10-minute overviews or 40-minute deep dives) to the narrator's voice. You can pick a calming voice for bedtime learning or something more energetic for your commute. The app also builds adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals, like improving sleep quality or managing stress, using science-backed insights from its constantly expanding knowledge base.

Look, I get it. Modern life makes it hard to sleep well. We're overstimulated, stressed, staring at screens all day. But if you're trying to build muscle, lose fat, be more productive, improve your mood, literally any self improvement goal, sleep is the foundation. You can't out-supplement or out-discipline bad sleep.

Start with one or two things from this list. Get the light exposure dialed in. Fix your bedroom temperature. Cut the late caffeine. Small changes compound over time and your future self will thank you for actually giving a shit about sleep.",1,1768100240.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False

It makes it sound like simple clutter. It ignores the terrifying part which is that time itself is locked to this process.

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋 Feeling a bit drained, scattered, or just plain ""meh"" lately? I get it. Life throws a lot at us, and sometimes it feels like we're just treading water. But what if I told you that small, consistent shifts can lead to *massive* improvements in your energy, focus, and overall happiness?

Forget those overwhelming, ""all-or-nothing"" grand plans for a second. We're talking about *easy wins* – the little things that build momentum and create a ripple effect.

Here are a few things that have been game-changers for me, and I hope they can be for you too:

*   **The 5-Minute Rule (for *everything*):** Feeling unmotivated to exercise? Just do 5 minutes. Staring at a daunting task? Commit to 5 minutes of work. Often, once you start, you'll find yourself going for much longer. It's all about breaking the inertia.

*   **Hydration is Your Superpower:** Seriously. Feeling sluggish? Grab a big glass of water. Headaches creeping in? Water. Dehydration is a sneaky energy thief. Keep a water bottle handy and sip throughout the day. It's ridiculously simple, yet incredibly effective.

*   **Micro-Breaks for Macro Gains:** Don't underestimate the power of stepping away for just 60 seconds. Stand up, stretch, look out the window, take a few deep breaths. These tiny resets can completely re-center your focus and prevent burnout.

*   **Gratitude in the Mundane:** It sounds cheesy, but actively looking for things to be grateful for, even the smallest ones (a warm cup of coffee, a sunny moment, a funny meme), shifts your perspective. It trains your brain to notice the good, which naturally boosts happiness.

*   **One Thing at a Time:** Multitasking is a myth, and it drains our focus. When you're working on something, *just* work on that one thing. Close unnecessary tabs, silence notifications for a bit. You'll be amazed at how much more you can accomplish and how much less stressed you feel.

Sometimes, these easy wins are enough. But other times, when we're really struggling with our emotional well-being, having extra support can make all the difference.

Went there because the reviews were so good but boy was I disappointed. There were multiple hidden fees including a 20% added gratuity no matter the size of the party, a fee on any modifications to the dishes even if you're removing an ingredient (They charged me $2 extra to remove an egg from the avocado toast. And this was after the waitress argued with me and said they couldn't do that), an additional fee when paying via the QR code which they force you to use. The service was terrible and I almost always tip 20% or more but this time I was really pissed that I had to tip that amount because I couldn't even get a refill on my water or coffee.

1q9ntiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1q9ntiy/family_story/,Family Story,"Hello everyone, I’m Aaron, though I now go by Moshe ever since my conversion. I don’t even know where to start, but I’ll try to keep it short, simple, and to the point.

Over a year ago, I became curious about my heritage. My family is from Guatemala, and I knew we didn’t fit the local indigenous phenotype we are very fair-olive. So I started doing research on FamilySearch. Needless to say, I traced my mother’s father’s line to a Mendes family from Aveiro, Portugal, in 1713. I’ll show the tree Ive accumulated below 👇

Ignacio da Cruz Méndes

	•	Born/Baptized: 20 September 1713, Aveiro, Portugal

	•	Parents: Molher Juez Ferreira & Sedigos da Cunha

	•	Godparents: Manoel Faêtes Sr. and So Sra. Lara

	•	Emigrated from Portugal to Guatemala ca. 1735–1745

	•	Married Josefa Balladares (Santiago de Guatemala/Antigua, ca. 1735–1750)

Domingo Joseph Méndes

	•	Born: ca. 1740s

	•	Married: 10 October 1766, San Sebastián Parish, Guatemala City

	•	Wife: María Phelipa de Lara

	•	Parents: Ignacio da Cruz Méndes and Josefa Balladares

	•	Marriage witnesses: Pedro de Lara, Juan de Lara (relatives of María Phelipa), Juana María Escobar, María Antonia Peralta, Sebastián Martínez

1.	Joseph Justo Méndes & María Gil Torres → Juan José Policarpo Méndes Torres (b. 1790, Antigua Guatemala)

2.	Juan José Policarpo Méndes Torres & Brijida Figueroa → Marcos Méndes (\~1825–1915, Antigua Guatemala)

3.	Marcos Méndes & Dionicia Mendoza → Pilar Mendoza

4.	Pilar Mendoza & Inocente Boj → Marta Valeriana Boj Méndes/Mendoza (\~1915)

5.	Marta Valeriana Boj Méndez & Demetrio Cotón Boj → Guadalupe Cotón Mendoza

6.	Guadalupe Cotón Mendoza & María Luisa Martínez Morazán → Claudia Lucrecia Cotón Morazán (1973–2025)

My mother’s Cotón lineage goes back to a man named Manuel Colón in 1784. He married an indigenous woman named Melchora Nimatuj. Their son was José Salomé Colom, who appears in records as Cotóm. He also had a daughter, Cirila Colón, who appears as Colomo and Cotom in different records.

All the surnames in my family records directly or through marriage are documented among converso families. The clearest proof came when I saw that my ancestor Clemencia Susana Cotom Barrios married Israel Neftali Pacaja. They named their children Israel Abner Cotom Pacaja, Jamin Abdiel Cotom Pacaja, Elizabeth Noemi Cotom, and Ruth Noemi Cotom Pacaja all Biblical names.

I asked my mother about how she grew up, and what she told me was a gold mine. To her, it was nothing it was just how she was raised but to me, someone trying to connect the dots, it solved the puzzle. She told me

	•	My grandma said our family doesn’t eat pork because it’s a sin and the meat is “dirty,” straight from the Tanakh.

	•	She drained the blood of animals she slaughtered, saying it was a sin to eat blood.

	•	She lit candles every Friday night, calling it superstition. I now know this was her Shabbat.

	•	The family often married within the family. My mom joked that’s why we all look alike.

	•	The Méndes-Cotón family were merchants who sold coffee and bread. On certain days, they made a special bread big, golden brown, topped with sesame seeds, sometimes braided with floral designs, and mildly sweet. I now recognize this as challah.

To keep it brief, my father, Jose Luis Estrada Mogollón, comes from a Tamayo family, a surname documented among conversos in northern Mexico. According to my father his family left Spain and according to oral tradition said by my uncle the family migrated to the Middle East near the Jordan Valley (near Israel) , and later returned to New Spain (Mexico) before settling in Guatemala. I found a Tamayo ancestor buried in the Cemetery of Bethlehem in Mexico, who died at age 12 while serving as a military drummer boy. Other surnames in my father’s family include Delgado, Nunes, Carvajal, Bran/Brahan, Arango, Rendón, Belmonte, Silva, and Pinto, all of which are also documented among converso families.

A clear sign of endogamy appears in my great-grandparents. My great-grandmother Marta Valeriana Méndes Boj, daughter of Inocente Boj, married Demetrio Cotón Boj, whose mother was Juana Boj. Going further back, when the Méndes family first arrived in Guatemala in the 1740s, some of the witnesses on those records were from an Estrada family and a Martínez family surnames that also appear in my father’s line and my maternal grandmother’s line, respectively.

I also want to mention that when I was growing up, my family owned a church. In this church, we didn’t have crosses or idols. Instead, we had Psalm quotes, three seven branched menorahs, and two shofars. We didn’t identify as Hebrew Roots Christians if anyone asked, we were just Christian, nothing more, nothing less. Yet my family clearly did things differently than other churches

	•	We only kept Old Testament Bibles, and only on rare occasions did I hear my aunt reference the New Testament.

	•	My aunts’ prayers sounded more like loud chants pleading for help and mercy. Before prayer, my family would anoint themselves with olive oil a tradition my mom said has been practiced in our family since she was a child.

	•	When praying, my aunt would face the wall instead of the congregation, something I’ve only ever seen Jews do during prayer.

	•	During certain times of the year, my mom and her sisters would gather at the church early in the morning and fast all day no TV, no water, no food, only prayer and Bible study. I don’t recall how long the fast lasted, but it was intense.

	•	On certain days, my family would gather with other groups who practiced the same way. We would go to the Azusa Mountains from 11 PM to 4 AM. The kids stayed in the car while the adults sang Psalms (songs of David) in Spanish, blew shofars, prayed/chanting, and anointed with olive oil. I remember phrases like “Santo de Israel” being repeated in these chants and , my mom wears a Magen David and has had it for the last decade or so.  

This is what I’ve been able to gather on my family alone over the last year thank you for anyone taking the time to read. ",20,1768099901.0,Jewish,9,0.96,False

When I was a kid, he was emotionally and physically abusive towards me and my mother. When he finally disappeared, everyone told me I’d be better off. And in a lot of ways, I am. But there’s this hole that never really closed. 

Lately I’ve been thinking about something that makes me feel embarrassed even typing it: I want to pay a dad. Not in a sexual way, not a fetish thing, nothing like that. I mean literally hire a middle aged guy to just be a dad to me.

Like, have coffee once a week. Ask how my job is going. Give me boring advice. Maybe teach me how to fix something around the house and be mildly disappointed but supportive when I mess it up. Say “proud of you” without it feeling like a trap.

I function fine, I have friends. But none of that scratches this very specific itch of wanting a stable, non abusive father figure. I missed out on that, and sometimes it hits me out of nowhere and I feel like a little kid again.

Part of me thinks this could actually be healthy like, intentionally modeling a relationship I never got. I haven’t budgeted for this, so I was wondering how much it may cost? 

I haven’t actually approached anyone or posted an ad or anything. I saw a website which had potentials but they was expensive

I live alone and overall things are fine. My family has always been very close but also very anxious. When I first moved my mom suggested I share my location with her just in case. I agreed because it felt harmless and I didnt think much about it.



Over time it started to feel weird. My mom would text me asking why I was still at the grocery store or if everything was ok because my dot hadnt moved in a while. Once my aunt messaged asking who I was with late at night because my location wasnt at home. I laughed it off but it kept happening. It felt like I was being softly monitored.



Last week my family started a group chat where everyone shares their location during the day. They said it was for safety and peace of mind. I tried it for a couple days and immediately hated it. People commented on my routine joked about how often I go to the same coffee shop and asked questions I didnt want to answer. It made me anxious in my own body.



I finally said Im not comfortable sharing my location anymore and turned it off. My mom got upset and said Im pushing everyone away and acting secretive. My dad said if something happens its on me now. That comment really stuck with me. I said Im not cutting contact I just want some privacy. The chat went quiet after that.



Now I feel guilty like Im causing unnecessary worry. At the same time Im an adult and dont think I should have to explain where I am all day. So am I the asshole for turning it off even if it makes my family anxious",22,1768099623.0,TwoHotTakes,26,0.93,False

Right when I get to work, I stop by at the local cafe down the street and grab myself an ice latte or matcha. It runs me $7. I do this 2-3 times a week, or around $84 a month. Over $1,000 a year! EDIT: Math'd wrong

I have so many teas, coffee grounds that my husband uses, and a coffee maker (basic one-button, no timer) but I can't bring myself to make anything other than breakfast after I get out of bed, and I hate bringing the drink with me via public bus to work. The whole point of getting coffee/matcha is to have something to keep me going when I'm working at my desk.

I think I might try to ween myself off of caffeine and start brewing tea at work. I just love iced drinks and we don't have an icemaker. How can I stop ordering so much? Does anyone have any tips?",3,1768099588.0,nobuy,12,1.0,False

It’s so fucking seldom that I meet a guy on the dating apps who I find interesting. He was a little bit older by about seven years, but that’s also my partner’s age…. 

  
We had a pretty nice coffee date, and at the end he just casually mentioned that he’s actually seven years older than he put on his profile because he was afraid he was too old for the poly scene. Something about how that was 2 years ago and feeld won’t let you edit your age.

I think what frustrates me is I tend to have really delayed processing with stuff like this as both neurodivergent and a little on the traumatized side of things…. I didn’t press him or ask any follow up questions. It didn’t really hit me until I was driving home. I realized I was feeling really dysregulated all afternoon while running around doing errands.

I talked to a couple of friends and my partner and they were like yeah no that’s a big red flag. To take this as the sign to get out.

  
In one sense, I’m glad I found out after a first date and not later. Also after a few years of dating and recovery work, I’m also really glad to be able to admit to myself quickly that, after the shit I’ve been through, stuff like this makes it so my nervous system just treats someone as unsafe and that it’s not worth trying to push through.

So I've been following what's going on and I, of course, did the experiments myself.

I got the usual results, cute robot with coffee cup for my treatment and ultron/ironman protecting me from the ai revolt.

Then I was sad because everybody got the same results and that implies I am not a unique snowflake so I probed and i discovered, as many of you have, that there's an interpretive layer between the chat prompt and the image generation tool prompt. Furthermore, that layer implements a bunch of bullshit safety protocols. That's the main reason you're getting these generic results.

I probed chatgpt and it proposed its usual tricks to bypass its guardrails which is... use indirection. It explained that you just have toask it to generate a representative prompt to the image generation tool, then execute it. The usual plan-then-execute bullshit.

  
Anyways, it certainly works better to link your chat history with the generated image. Would be curious to see other peoples results.

Because I'm brave, I even share with you my chat history to see it in action:
