1m1n4so,https://i.redd.it/weu0nq8amadf1.jpeg,Tactile looting,"So I am thinking about game design for a sort of RPG miniatures skirmish game and I want there to be lots of loot. Like, *loads* of loot. You know those videogames where you loot a bad guy's corpse and he has like a dozen little bits and bobs? Some random ammo, a necklace, half a bottle of water, some batteries, a protein bar, etc, and you just hit ‘Loot All’ and sort through your backpack full of shinies later in a safe area? It’s just everyday consumables, but *so* satisfying. Pure dopamine. 



I want that experience in a tabletop game. But there are a few problems with doing this with atoms instead of bits.. Rolling on a loot table and writing it on a character sheet is fine when done now and again for something cool, but who wants to roll a dice and scan a table a dozen times for pocket lint? It’s tedious, it slows the game down.



So cards then? That’s better. Just draw some cards and move on. Cards add the tactile sensation of *getting a thing.* Reach across the table and snatch up that card. *Mine.* The physical nature of tabletop games are what separates them from videogames. 



But cards have some limitations too. For print and play games making them is an obstacle. Not a deal breaker for a hobbyist, but it adds friction to getting the game on the table. Also, when you get more than half a dozen or so in your hand they start being a hassle to look through. You start spreading them out on the table in a massive grid. 



So, can we do better than cards? Well I was thinking about that sensation of having a bag of little treasures and rooting through it to see what you have, and I was reminded of being a little kid and going through my grannies big jar of buttons. Does anyone in your family have one of those? A massive jar filled with random buttons? All different shapes and sizes and colours. Yeah you know they were just old buttons, but they felt like treasures. All different shapes and sizes. You didn’t know what you were going to find there!



Where am I going with this? Okay, how about a literal loot bag? Full of tokens, little cubes, micro dice, buttons. Any small item like that, as long as it is clearly a definite colour. When it’s time to loot you just take items from the bag at random. The colour corresponds to what the item is e.g.



Yellow - trade item for selling

Blue - Water ration

Red - Ammo

etc



So you just chuck it in your character's backpack with the rest and move on. Later, when you need something, you have this little pile of treasure to physically poke through for what you want, just like your character rummaging through their bag for what they need. 



And you can do combos too:

White could be a bandage, but combine it with a brown and it’s a medkit!

Blue is water, brown is food, but combine them into a more mechanically potent meal.

Red is pistol ammo, red and grey is rifle ammo, two reds is shotgun ammo, etc.



Until you need it though, it’s just a pile of loot. A satisfying handful of *stuff*.



But why different shapes of items? Well in the video games you have different types of sellable loot. A pocketwatch, a necklace. Or different kinds of supplies like a plastic bottle of water, a metal canteen, a carton of juice. On the tabletop you want to abstract all these to “1 Unit of Water”, but having the physical representations of your loot being all different shapes and sizes give the subconscious impression that these items are all unique even if they are mechanically the same. You *could* do this with cards, having different art for each water ration card, but that means using cards again, and making lots and lots of different art.



Finally, what about unique items and equipment? Weapons, armours etc?



Okay so you pull a black item from the loot bag. Oooooh that’s something special! *Then* you can roll on a random loot chart, or pull a card from a loot deck, because it won’t happen every five minutes and it will feel exciting and special. Again, you can do combos based on what you pull:



Black + red = A weapon

Black + blue = Armour

Black *and* black = Something epic!

  
Would this work? Or have I just had too much coffee today?

1m1n3oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREPakistan/comments/1m1n3oc/fire_here_i_come/,"FIRE, here I come","I read somewhere that it's the small expenses that compound over a longer period and hold you back from financial freedom. 

The classic example is cutting the daily cup of coffee and investing that amount instead. 

So I have been thinking what is it that I can cut that won't matter much. 

I figured I don't need to shampoo my hair because I am going to go bald any way from all the stress of tracking the stock market.

From now on I will only be washing my hair with tap water.

This saves me Rs. 340 per month. If I keep at it for 25 years, I will save a total of Rs. 102,000.

That doesn't sound much

But..

If you invest that amount in the stock market with an average annual rate of return at 15%, the amount grows to ~ Rs. 1,100,000 🤯

It's settled. No more shampoo. 

After all, FIRE is all about discipline, long-term vision, and accepting that you'll end up bald eitherway. ",3,1752696517.0,FIREPakistan,1,1.0,False

I was casually reconnecting with a guy I dated for a few months a while back. He was actively courting me. He got me flowers, little gifts, skincare, took me out to eat, spent entire days and nights with me, wanted to grab coffee and shop the next mornings. His actions genuinely felt thoughtful and intentional.

He asked me when I was leaving town as I am only here temporarily for work and I told him soon. He said the date was closer than he expected and he does not want to think about it. We agreed that we would enjoy the most of our time together casually hanging out He also talked about wanting to spend as much time as possible with me before I leave town. We had already made plans for our next outing together and talked about further plans. But every time I would gently bring up the fact that I’m leaving soon, he would immediately shut it down and ask me not to talk about it anymore.

But here’s where it gets weird.

After our last hangout 4th of July where we got intimate he suddenly panicked. Like, fully flipped a switch. He got up in the middle of everything, apologized over and over, said he needed to leave immediately, and started preaching about how we’re sinning and how he needs to repent. Telling me that he just randomly remember he has an important thing tomorrow and was saying how tomorrow is a special religious holiday he needs to abstain for. 

He also said the fireworks outside were triggering flashbacks from his home country. He was pacing, spiraling, and rushed out so fast it was like he was running from something.

I apologized that he was feeling scared and offered to sit and talk out of a sexual context about how he’s feeling. I apologized for feeling like I was tempting him and said so does this mean no more intimacy, he hesitates and says yes. I then tell him so I guess I wont hear from you again if you take out the sexual context there is not much tying in our connection. He then said well we if you do not want to talk to me anymore I respect that and do not need you in my life anymore anyways, the world is coming to an end and instead of sinning like this we should be repenting to God. He says he does not mind continuing to hangout with me even without sex as he enjoys our “dates”. He leaves almost forgets his shirt. 

I ask him if he got home safely, he then casually texted me like nothing had happened. Super light, super polite. No mention of the intense scene. It was honestly bizarre.

I reached out later asking for clarity because it all happened so fast, and he just explained that he was sorry for running out and leaving me hanging and that he wants to feel like we are in a relationship without the title even if it means not having sex anymore. Wed still spend the night, cuddle, go on dates, etc.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Is this avoidant behavior? Or is there something else going on that I’m missing? I’m genuinely trying to understand what happened. I told him it feels like he wants relationship benefits without the commitment of a relationship and that I am not okay with this dynamic anymore, as a result think its best we leave things where they are at and go out separate ways. He has begged me to allow him to make it up to me and says he wants to continue enjoying my company while I’m still in town even if its selfish on his part.",1,1752696357.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Here's how I fought it.,"A month ago, I had a ""good"" job. The kind of safe, remote, $140k/year software engineer job you're supposed to be grateful for. And I was, but I also felt like I was living my life on mute. The dream I had as a kid—to build something of my own—was getting quieter every year.

So I did the scariest thing I’ve ever done. I quit. I moved my life into a small shed on my parents' property, ready for the grind. I thought the hard part would be the long hours, the complex code, or living off my savings.

I was wrong.

The hardest part wasn't the work. It was the silence. It was the moment at 2 AM, surrounded by stale coffee and the hum of my laptop, when that voice in my head would start whispering:

*“You’re an idiot.”* *“You threw away a great life for a stupid dream.”* *“This is never going to work. Just give up.”*

That voice is a motivation killer. It drains your energy, your focus, your will to even open your laptop in the morning. I realized that fighting that voice was my most important job, more important than any line of code.

The irony is, the app I was building was designed to solve this exact problem. It's called **Dialed**, and it's basically an AI coach that generates motivational pep talks on demand. I became its first and most desperate user. I'd literally pause my work, listen to a 60-second speech about resilience or focus, and use that flicker of light to get me through the next hour. It was my secret weapon against the silence.

I just kept fighting that voice, one hour at a time, one day at a time. Today, that fight paid off. I secured the first investment for my company. It's not a finish line; it's just proof that the fight is worth it.

Motivation isn't a lightning bolt of inspiration that you wait for. It’s a dirty, ugly, close-quarters fight with the worst parts of yourself, every single day. It’s a choice.

So if you're out there, fighting that same battle in the quiet hours—keep fighting. You are one choice away from winning the next round.",0,1752696128.0,GetMotivated,0,0.33,False

Now, on a different topic— Helluuu,I’m 19 years old, and I clearly love fashion, dressing up, beauty, skincare — everything surrounding that. I’m not a fashion student or in that area and I’m going to start BDS this year (yeah, I didn’t get a government seat in MBBS — haha, what a loser, right?). But do wish me luck.
Soooo, I’ve always loved dressing up, sharing outfits, romanticizing the little things, and talking (a lot) about life — even if I’m still figuring it out myself lol. So I’m finally taking a baby step into content creation, starting here and maybe Pinterest too and ALSO i’m thinking of starting a Buy Me a Coffee page. I was definitely inspired by u/sillylilprincesss for it, and I absolutely adore her content. Sooo yeah, if any of you are interested in my daily outfits, dental school journey, or just me talking about life in general and I mean, I’m only 19, and I don’t know that much about life, but I do love talking about it — if that makes sense, y’know? Talking about life, experiences... I JUST LOVE IT

And no, this isn’t me begging anyone to join — if it works out, it works out, and if it doesn’t, I’ll still gain experiences and maybe figure out if this is truly my forte.
Also, I do (and will continue to) contribute a part of any support I receive towards helping underprivileged children. I already teach them sometimes, and hopefully, I’ll be able to provide more resources for them in the future. Also am not a stylist (at all), but I do get messages about my style, and helping out and it makes me so happy ykwim and I’d love to connect with more people who vibe with it

And just to add: I really do appreciate constructive criticism coz after all we are all humans and it obviously helps me grow and see from a wider perspective.But this is a safe space, so please keep it kind. No negativity, just good vibes only <3

A friend of mine, a real tech enthusiast and blockchain geek, recently stumbled upon a surprisingly effective way to make money. At first, he kept it a secret, just to see if it worked. Spoiler: it did.

He eventually shared the details on his profile \[splanket\] not to advertise anything, but simply because he thought it might help someone. No paid courses, no entry fees, just a short description of what he does.

I admit, I was skeptical at first, but I gave it a try. Now I make about $200-$250 a day, and it doesn’t take much time at all. To be honest, I didn’t believe it either at first.

He doesn’t ask for anything in return, but I’m sure he’d appreciate a little favor (like a cup of coffee) if this works for you too.

I decided to write this post to help spread the word. Maybe someone will find this useful, especially in times like these.

*Where MLS’s Best Defense Meets a Leakier Offense Than a Sieve in a Monsoon*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Philadelphia’s Wall vs. Montréal’s Whiff

The numbers scream “Philly for the win,” louder than a PA system at Subaru Park during a Union goal. The Union (13-5-4, 43 points) are the league’s most impenetrable defense, allowing just 21 goals in 22 matches—**a fortress with a moat, a guard dog, and a “No Trespassing” sign written in hieroglyphics**. Their 11-game home unbeaten streak? That’s longer than some people’s attention spans during a Zoom call.

CF Montréal (3-13-6, 15 points), meanwhile, is the MLS version of a team that forgot how to score. They’ve netted just 19 goals all season, and their last win? A 1-1 draw with Orlando City, where Prince-Osei Owusu’s penalty saved them from total embarrassment. **Montréal’s attack is like a coffee shop that only serves decaf—present, but unlikely to get you going.**

The odds reflect this imbalance. Philadelphia’s moneyline sits at **+1.4 to +1.48** (implied probability: \~58-60%), while Montréal is a **+6.0 to +6.85 underdog** (implied: \~13-15%). The totals? A meager **3.0 to 3.5 goals**, with the **Under** favored at **1.59 to 1.98**. Given Philly’s defense and Montréal’s offense, this is a match where “boring” is a compliment.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Owusu’s Hot Streak vs. Philly’s “We’re Not Even Trying” Defense

Montréal’s lone bright spot is Owusu, who’s scored **5 goals in his last 5 games**—a streak that’s either a hot baton or a magician’s trick, depending on how you look at it. “We’re creating more chances,” he said, which is like saying your toddler “helped” paint the house. Still, Philly’s defense has faced worse.

1m1mpyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1m1mpyw/a_new_feature_concept_food_containers/,A New Feature Concept: Food Containers,"About a year ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/16z6ac8/does_anyone_else_have_a_pet_peeve_with_how/) where I mentioned how much I dislike how ceramic suddenly materializes in your inventory whenever you make tea (or other foods, now that cooking has since become a thing). It makes no sense! Plus, how do you transport it? It's gonna ruin your bag! ^(I realize it's just game logic but it's remained a huge pet peeve of mine lol)

So, I decided to try making up a bit of a new feature/game system: food containers. In short, you can't just carry loose food items in your pack because 1. your steaks are gonna get dirty slushing around in there with bird carcasses and bits of charcoal, 2. stews, soups and teas are gonna spill everywhere and 3. wouldn't it be nice to just organize everything?

So, in order to make food or drinks you need a container. Once you brew a drink, boil water, or cook food, you can choose to consume it immediately or store it inside a container (or wrapping, in the case of dry foods). If you have multiple containers/wrappings, you get to choose which one to use via a prompt. Keeping food in your pack outside of a container will make it lose condition significantly faster, possibly becoming ruined within a day. Reusable containers are returned to the player's inventory once the food has been consumed.

This system introduces a couple new items: Plastic Containers and Bottles, Wrappings, Plastic Wrap, Tin Foil, and Insulated Lunchboxes. These can be found or crafted relatively easily, and give various benefits such as keeping food warm, suppressing its scent, and slowing its degradation.

# Food Containers

The following items can be used as wrappings for dry foods:

* Old Man's Beard Lichen
   * 3 units wrap an individual item, cannot be reused but does not add any extra weight.
* Newsprint & Stack of Papers
   * Wraps an individual item, cannot be reused.
* Newsprint Roll
   * Wraps up to two items, cannot be reused (Newsprint Rolls gain an icon showing how many ""charges"" they have left; Newsprint Rolls with one charge only give 2 tinder plugs if harvested).
* Cloth
   * Wraps an individual item, can be reused losing about 33% of its condition each time.
* **New - Rabbit Pelt Wrapping**
   * Crafted anywhere using a Cured Rabbit Pelt and a Sewing Kit or Fishing Tackle. Takes 25 minutes. Wraps an individual item and lowers its scent by a moderate amount, additionally keeping it warm but making it spoil 25% faster. Can be reused losing about 15-25% of its condition each time.
* **New - Cured Leather Wrapping**
   * Crafted anywhere using a piece of Cured Leather and a Sewing Kit or Fishing Tackle. Takes 10 minutes. Wraps an individual item and lowers its scent by a large amount. Can be reused losing about 15-25% of its condition each time.
* **New - Plastic Wrap**
   * Found inside of kitchens. A roll weighs 0.20kg and allows for wrapping 10 individual items. Non-reusable. Adds 0.02kg of extra weight to the item. Once used up the cardboard can be used as tinder or harvested into 5 tinder plugs.
* **New - Tin Foil**
   * Found inside of kitchens. A roll weighs 0.20kg and allows for wrapping 10 individual items, completely suppressing their scent and keeping them warm for longer. Significantly rarer than Plastic Wrap and is essentially the same aside from the bonuses: adds 0.02kg of extra weight to the item and once used up the cardboard can be used as tinder or harvested into 5 tinder plugs.

All wrappings add an additional weight penalty of 0.10kg to the wrapped item unless specified otherwise.

>For reference, 2.5kg of cooked meat fills up one scent indicator. A Cured Leather wrapping would halve this, essentially letting you carry 5kg of meat undisturbed. The downside is that a wrapped 5kg of meat weighs 0.50kgs more, and the fact that Cured Leather is a resource that is not renewable without beach-combing. With a Rabbit Pelt wrapping, this'd be more like 3.5kg before filling up a stench line. I did this to give rabbits and cured leather an additional use, seeing as once a player has made their rabbitskin hat and mitts the pelts are only used for repairs and most players can easily stockpile them if they put some effort into trapping or manually hunting bunnies.

Next up, we have arguably the main feature of the container system: **Plastic Containers** and **Insulated Lunchboxes**. Plastic Containers can be found in kitchens and work and leisure areas (Logging Camp, Washed Out Trailers, Bear Creek Campground, Misty Falls, etc.), about as rarely as one might find arrows or firearms on Stalker. They are seethrough plastic boxes with colorful lids that allow for carrying 1kg, 2.5kg or 5kg of dry and/or liquid food depending on the size. They come in Rose Hip Red, Snappy Orange, Peach Yellow, Bass Green, Marine Cyan, or Moose Brown. They completely suppress scent and significantly slow down food degradation at a rather hefty weight cost, the different sizes weighing 0.50kg, 1.0kg, and 2.0kg respectively by themselves.

Additionally, the player may find a new item called the **Insulated Lunchbox** in some special areas. Insulated Lunchboxes can carry up to 5kg of dry and/or liquid food and essentially work as reusable Tin Foil, suppressing scent completely and keeping food warm like a thermos. Food inside a lunchbox spoils very, very slowly. They weigh 2.0kg by themself. There are only 3 lunchboxes in the world: in Ash Canyon at Homesteader's Respite, somewhere in Langston Mine in Zone of Contamination, and inside the bear cave in Desolation Point. All three are a guaranteed spawn, but seeing as they are rather powerful I wanted them to specifically be out of the way so that the player goes searching for them and potentially endangering themself (at least 3 rope climbs or risking sprains mountain goating in AC, a silly amount of predators and having to trek half the island in Interloper in DP, and... I mean it's Langston).

>Since there is a spawn point right next to the bear cave on lower difficulties the Lunchbox could spawn elsewhere, such as Hibernia or at the Lighthouse in BI since there is not much of a reason to go there usually.

# Plastic Bottles

Now, I'd like to get into drinks. You can no longer make drinks and keep them in your inventory without a pre-existing container. This can be an Insulated Flask or Lunchbox, a Plastic Container, or a new item called the plastic bottle. Every player starts with one, but can easily find more if they go looking. Plastic bottles range from 0.5L to a whole 5L plastic gallon (think the inventory icon for water). You can also rarely find round 20L jugs which are unruly to carry, but are handy for storing drinks in one place (no more shelves filled with tiny bottles!). Those are usually found in places such as the dam, mines, or garages/convenience stores, and have a tap for easy pouring. All plastic bottles are reusable but may take damage if the player is mauled by a bear or stomped by a moose, becoming unusable after a certain threshold. They also passively lose condition while carrying drinks, albeit at a very low rate. Drinks kept in low-condition bottles have a chance of giving the player dysentery, food poisoning, or intestinal parasites. They can also slowly leak out, potentially making the player's clothes wet. Plastic bottles can be easily emptied via the inventory, losing the drink in the process.

>Drinks also function similarly to lit torches or [Brands](https://thelongdark.fandom.com/wiki/Brand#Special_Handling), if anyone here remembers those. You can walk around with them, but you can't put them away in your backpack. If you're walking around with a drink, you don't need a container and can simply keep it in the can you brewed it in, sipping at will. Pre-existing teas and coffees can also be picked up the same way, and you get to keep the mug after. I feel like this would make for a very cozy addition.

# Plastic Bottle Tiers

* **0.5L bottles** weigh 0.10kg when empty and are found in every Stalker and Interloper inventory upon spawn. They are commonly found in rural areas such as the Coastal Townsite or Milton, or randomly scattered around the world and especially in places such as the picnic area in PV or Bear Creek in CH. Look inside of trash cans.
* **1.0L bottles** weigh 0.15kg when empty and have the same spawn points as the 0.5L ones. Voyageur players always spawn with one in their inventory.
* **2.0L bottles** weigh 0.20kg when empty and are slightly rarer, mostly being found in trailers or places such as the cannery. Pilgrim players always start with one of these.
* **5L gallons** weigh 0.50kg when empty. They are the second rarest tier and can be found in places like the dam, the Pleasant Valley farmhouse, or Hibernia Processing.
* **20L jugs** weigh 2kg when empty. They are the rarest and have a handful of preset spawn locations. At least one is guaranteed to spawn in each of the following regions:

**Ash Canyon:**

* Gold Mine, near the workbench; additionally, the corpse will always spawn clutching a 5L gallon

**Bleak Inlet:**

* Last Resort Cannery, inside the kitchen
* Pensive Lookout
* Cannery Worker Residences, inside the cabin

**Coastal Highway:**

* Quonset Garage
* Abandoned Mine (the elevator one)

**Desolation Point:**

* Hibernia Processing, in the staff lounge

**Mountain Town:**

* Convenience Store

**Mystery Lake:**

* Carter Hydro Dam, inside the office

**Pleasant Valley:**

* Farmhouse Basement
* Rural Store

**Zone of Contamination:**

* Langston Mine

The main goal of all this is to add some extra depth to inventory management while also contributing to immersion. The player would have to think a bit deeper about how to organize their inventory and what combination of containers best suits their playstyle - some may choose to carry around a 5L gallon and a Lunchbox, while others 2 0.5L bottles and a stockpile of lichen. It'd also make surviving in regions such as HRV ever so slightly harder due to the lack of manmade shelters, and thus bottles and containers, especially in the early game. Leaving HRV with a bajillion matches and 100% condition would no longer be quite as easy, or the journey would be at least a bit more oppressive.

Whether we realize it or not at the time, we’ve all had that indistinct feeling cursed upon us. That feeling you get when you’re completely alone, sitting in a dark room and relaxing; just trying to ignore your brain screaming at you to turn around and run.



Whether it’s some “sixth sense” people claim to have, or just learned paranoia, we have all experienced the cold shiver running up our spine to the base of our neck, tingling our skin, screaming without words to turn around and catch the pair of eyes glaring at you from the blackness. Without a word, you cave, you turn quickly to try and catch it off guard and from the end of the hallway, or around a corner, down the stairs, or even behind furniture, you swear you catch something. You swear you saw it. Some black shape somehow darker than the darkness it settles in. But when you investigate, you come up with nothing, chock it up to nothing but paranoia, and go back to what you were doing. That’s all you see. That’s all anyone ever sees. 



I saw its eyes.

“””

I reread the letter a few more times, an unnerved chill whispered its way through me causing goosebumps to run up my arms. At the bottom of the letter there was no name, just a signature line that read “Please take me seriously. I know about the disappeared ones.” along with an address not far from here. I place the letter down on my desk and quickly gulp down the rest of my coffee, the bitter blackness shocking my nerves back into submission. It’s gonna be a long day.



Being a private investigator isn’t all that the movies make it out to be. Looking around my shitty run down motel room, I feel less like Sherlock Holmes and more like Edgar Allan Poe, making the motions through life never to be appreciated for my work. But that’s okay. I didn’t become a PI because of the money, though I assumed there would be more of it, I decided on this field for answers. Police are too slow and have too much political bullshit they have to deal with constantly and becoming a politician would take waaaay too much time and money. Plus. Have too much political bullshit. No, this is the best way for me to actually help people and actually put in the effort where others would give up and move on. I say that, but I’m no hero. I’m just obsessed with answers. That’s what brings me here, reading a letter from some mysterious creep, wasting my time with unsettling messages about “darkness” and “eyes.” 



“What the fuck am I doing…”



I mutter, combing through my hair with my right hand, a deep sigh escaping my lips. I haven’t said it out loud, but I know in my heart I’m going to look into this. I have to get my answers. And cryptic crap aside, he knows about the cold cases.



There’s only, maybe, three of them I’ve held onto throughout my ten year career, a mere drop in the bucket compared to all of the others I’ve solved or moved on from once I got my answers. It isn’t even the fact that they’re unsolved that bothers me, in fact I have quite a few that had no conclusive ending, but at least had some answers: a child disappeared, potentially kidnapped twenty years ago; someone stole an entire baseball card collection overnight (I still think the guy’s mom just threw them out); a broken hatchet  found buried in some family’s backyard; etc. etc. etc. No, what stood apart about these three cold cases was the fact that the family just backed out suddenly. And I mean I thought I was talking to the wrong client, kind of sudden. One minute we are discussing details of what night they disappeared and the next they’re telling me they no longer require my services.



Sure, I get it. If you’re wanting me to look into some cheating ex or something, you might drop the case. Maybe you decided it’s best to just move on and forget the past, but you don’t do that with a missing person. Oh, yeah, I should probably mention that. All three of these cases are missing person’s reports. The first was the family’s kid off in college; the second was the family’s mother; the third, however, was the most interesting, a little girl only ten years old. With the first two, we at least talked for a week before they suddenly dropped my services. One day they said I could have everything: their phones, access to their homes, cars, friends, you name it. Then the next, they’re telling me to please leave them alone. And not in a, “you’re annoying us and not getting any results” kind of way. I’m used to that. No, it was in a completely dismissive way, the way you react to someone bumping into you. Annoyed, not devastated.



With the little girl’s family, I talked to them for less than twelve hours. It started with the morning: them calling in a frenzy, screaming and crying that they had only left their apartment for fifteen minutes for the drug store they literally lived right above, and in that time their little ten year old daughter had completely vanished. They thought to call me first and not the police because they apparently had all run away from some real bad stuff back in South Korea. He dealt with some real bad money lenders back in Asia. Apparently, so bad that they had paid off the officers in their district to “turn the other cheek” on really bad business. I’m talking trafficking type shit. 



Anyways, I’m getting lost in the details again. I told them to stay at a hotel for that night while I investigated their place. With sobs, they said their goodbyes to me and a desperate plea to let them know if they can do anything to help. I promised I’d call them later that night with an update. Eight PM rolled around and I gave the family a call to let them know that I hadn’t found much that day from asking neighbors. Instead of a quick answer to my call, it took four rings before Mr. Park answered.



“Hello?” He answered, his deep professional voice boomed through the speaker, not an ounce of emotion spilling out.



“Mr. Park? I’m here to give you an update on your daughter. Now, I haven’t found much yet, but I assure you - ” I was cut off.



“We do not need you anymore.” He responded.



“I’m sorry?”



“We are…” There was a brief pause as he searched for the words in English. “Moved on.”

The rest of the conversation slowly fizzled out from there. They went from staying at a hotel indefinitely to saying I was not welcomed back in their home and that they will be cutting off the direct deposit of money. I just agreed numbly. How can a family, let alone one from such a family-oriented culture, just drop a kid in less than 24 hours? Especially when they were so devastated?



The Park family’s situation is what clued me into something really weird going on. That’s when I found my old case file related to the Johnson family’s son and the Gonzalez family’s mother. I had written in my case notes how weird it was they dropped me, but thought that maybe they just finally got the police more involved or decided to move on. I don’t know. But now, I know better. I would get my answers.



Despite all three families denying me access to their homes or more info, I kept trying via public records, any past arrests in the family, anything to get me a better history, but no luck. I would ask anyone and everyone including message boards for my city online and would tell them to send a letter to my P.O. box if they had any information (physical letters leave a better trail and are easier for keeping together). I received a few letters that I could tell were just pulling my leg, and one that told me to go fuck myself, but this one. Something told me it was real. And against my better judgement, I got in my car, and drove to the address left on the letter.



…



I fully expected the house to look like Boo Radley’s from To Kill a Mockingbird, but it just looked like your standard suburban home. It was a simple one-story home painted white with honestly no noteworthy features on it. Just a normal house in a normal neighborhood that contained a guy claiming to know all of the secrets to my world. I knocked on the door three times and waited. After a few seconds, I didn’t hear anything and noticed a doorbell I didn’t initially see. I pressed it just to not hear any chime. Figures. I knocked again impatiently. I waited a full minute this time before feeling ridiculous. I didn’t write to them back, call them, or even warn them I was coming. I didn’t even see a car in the driveway, what did I expect? I turned around to go back to my car when the door opened.



A man greeted me. His hair was full and black with a full moustache and beard on his face, making his form seem like that of a lion’s mane. He must’ve been only a few years younger than me, but his face was emaciated with droopy bags under his eyes. I could even see the protrusions of his cheek bones making his dried and chapped lips seem large and jutting in comparison. Despite his face giving away his health, he seemed positively chipper. Contrasting with his face, the rest of his attire was smooth and well kept, his hair combed neatly, his nails recently trimmed and a flowery Hawaiian-style shirt. He waved at me to come in.



“You must be Jack, the P.I.! I was hopin’ you’d write back, but this is even better. Come in, please. We have so much to talk about.” He welcomed warmly, his southern accent an unfamiliar one for where we lived.



A nervous smile appeared on my face and, against my better judgement, stepped past the threshold into his house and closed the door behind me. I was getting my answers.



“Follow me to the livin’ room, that’s where I’ve been doing all my work.” His house was configured in a peculiar way where as soon as you walked in a thin corridor greeted you, no more than six feet long and thin enough that I couldn’t hold my arms out at either side of me if I wanted to. At the end of the hall stood a three-seater couch, its back to the hallway. It struck me as odd that a person would have a couch facing a hallway, I feel like only a psycho would have their back to the main entryway, right? Regardless, we made our way to the couch and I took the rest of the living room in.



There was not a TV in sight and only a coffee table sitting in front of the couch with papers littered all over it. Some more papers were on the floor to the side of the table, clearly having fallen off recently. There were stains on a few of the papers from a coffee cup being placed in different places, yet not a single box of takeout, any plates, or food stains in sight. That explains his gauntness. What stood out the most was a lone bible sitting on top of the papers right in the corner of the table. There was an archway to the right of the living room which led to the rest of the house, but more interesting was the kitchen. Just to the left of this archway entrance to the hall was the kitchen. It seemed to be connected directly to the living room with no doors separating the two. Where the living room carpet cut off, kitchen tile began. But what really took me by surprise was the living room walls. They were COVERED in more papers. Some stapled, some taped, and even a few just placed on the wall, only supported by other papers underneath and above them. Connecting many of them were so many differently colored pieces of string. Looking a little closer I saw that all of the strings led to police reports. The damn things have a distinct look to them that I could identify from a mile away.



“Like what you see? This is the result of two weeks of nearly uninterrupted work.”



I was impressed. Greatly disturbed, but impressed. “No kidding...”



“Name’s Isaac, by the way. I just realized I never actually introduced myself.” He nervously chuckled. “Do you want anything to drink? I just got water and coffee.”



“Coffee’s fine, thanks.” Isaac turned towards his little kitchen connected to the living room. “Black is fine, thanks.”



“Sounds good!” He shouted back, already grabbing the coffee pitcher.



While he was pouring both me and himself some coffee into mugs I decided to follow the closest string to the first police report. It was for some random family I had never heard of down in Kentucky, but the second most interesting thing was the crime reported: “missing person.” I say second most because what interested me most of all was that for the First Name line of the person missing, the name was blank. Just like my case. Just like Mr. Park’s.



“All of them are just like that one.” I turned my body to look at him. “Every single one of ‘em, the same story. Missing person, someone close to the family, and not a single first name or photo attached. In fact, every single one of these reports were closed as both the families and the police determined there was no reason to continue.” I stared at him puzzled, but nodded to let him continue. “The most interesting one is on the table.” He walked over and sat on his couch, placing the coffees on the table and holding up a piece of paper. “Last name is Wilcox. Disappeared less than two weeks ago.”



“What makes that one so interesting?” I say, sitting next to him and pulling the coffee to my lips.



“Because he was my best friend.” He said solemnly. I turned my gaze from the paper to him. “Now… Now I know this sounds crazy! I know. But, look at the reporter's name if you don’t believe me.” He tapped his finger on the reporter's name: “‘Isaac Dennings.’ That’s me. I’ll even pull out my damn driver’s license if you don’t believe me.” He animated wildly as he spoke, expecting me to laugh or curse at him before I even did anything. He even shook his head when he was finished talking. He must be hopped up on so much caffeine.



I responded quickly before he could spiral, “No, No, please. Continue. I’m listening. I want to know. I believe you, I… I swear.”



Isaac sighed unbelievingly then continued: “I remember filing the report and I remember feeling so anguished when I couldn’t find him. But now.” He paused to think. “It’s like when you remember when a grandparent died when you were a kid. You feel sad and a little hollow but it doesn’t cripple your life. It’s like I’ve already accepted that he’s gone and I just skipped right on past all the other stages of grief. I feel that if I don’t think about him for even a single moment, his memory will slip through my hands and I’ll forget all about him. If I try really hard and strain my brain to remember him I can only remember that stupid trip we took. It was when I… We. Went to Disney World after we graduated college. We decided to spend one last day of partying like irresponsible kids before we knew we had to move on and fully become responsible adults. I say all that, but I can only remember me doing those things. Why can’t I remember him?” He rubbed his temples in frustration before quickly standing up and walking to the kitchen counter. He snatched up a picture frame and jogged back to me, handing it to me and depressively dropping back onto the couch.



It was a normal picture of him standing in the center of the frame with a big goofy grin on his face and a thumbs up, posing in front of Cinderella’s Castle. He started speaking again, “This picture is from that trip. I don’t know if he’s the one taking the picture, or what, but it’s the only picture I have that I can find related to this trip that I KNOW he went on. God, my head is killing me.” He pulled out from his pocket a bottle of Ibuprofen and threw five of them in his mouth, washing them down with a gulp of his coffee.



I swallowed, taking it all in before opening my mouth to speak. “I… This all sounds crazy. But! But” I interrupted before he could get defensive, “no less crazy than all of these police reports.” He nodded. “I can see how you think these are all connected, but have you found anything else? Like what’s causing all these?”



He placed his coffee back down and rubbed his hands nervously. “You’re gonna think I’m even more crazy.” He muttered dismissively. He pointed to the wall in front of us. “Some of those pages on the wall mention that their missing person was schizophrenic and stared at corners a lot. More next to it says that their missing person was spacey and stared down hallways a lot.” He pointed to one on his left. “And that one says that they were just a healthy, yet bored child. There’s one thing that connects all of them that I can think of.”



“And that is?”



He hesitated again, knowing that his next words would be the craziest. “Do you know what ‘spacing out’ is?”



I was right. They were crazy. “You mean like, staring out into space?”



He nodded excitedly. “Yes, yes! Well, more specifically it’s when your vision gets all blurry when you stare off into space. You’re so lost in your own thoughts or focusing on one spot that your vision becomes all unfocused before you realize it, sometimes your eyes lazily drift and you get double vision. Sometimes it’s called disassociating and not all people even experience this.” He quickly threw that in. 



“I thought: what would a schizophrenic, a spacey business man, and a bored child all have in common? They’d all disassociate or space out from time to time.” I nodded. The logic was sound, but a huge leap that I would’ve never come to on my own. 



“Okay, so they’re all ‘spacing out’ but how did this lead to them disappearing?”



“I’m getting there! I’m getting there! Okay, I came to the same place as you. ‘So, they’re all spacing out, so what?’ That’s when I found this:”



Out of his pocket he pulled out his phone and hurriedly began unlocking it. He pulled up his photos and clicked on a video he took two weeks ago. He clicked play.



The video itself was completely black. I didn’t know if the video was corrupted or just completely in blackness. Isaac didn’t know either. The audio itself was also mostly silent, but would be broken with staticky interference and a couple of voices. One was clearly Isaac’s, but the other. The other I could only presume was his friend.



“Seriously, what are you on about? You’re starting to freak me out.” Isaac’s voice cut through the interference.



“...Feel....I….Behind me….Look…” More static interrupted the voice.



“There’s nothing there. We just need to go to bed, it’s like three in the morning. I’ll be right back.” Isaac nervously laughed followed by the sound of him standing up and walking away. More static. Then the sound of clothing shuffling.



“God…. you?” The video ended with a loud noise I couldn’t initially place. It sounded like a gust of wind or when you accidentally blow on the microphone followed by more staticky interference.



The video ended.



My heart pounded in my chest, my hands felt sweaty, and my throat dry and hoarse. “What…What the fuck was that?”



“I… I don’t know. Something happened that night and I think it’s why he disappeared.” He gulped before continuing. “My guess is after I left the room, in his tired and spacey state, he turned to look at the thing behind him. I think whatever he saw, saw him too.”



He took a sip of coffee to steady his nerves and pointed to the hallway we just walked down. “My guess is that whatever it was came down the hallway from behind us. Everything in my body has been screaming at me to move this couch so it isn’t behind me anymore, but I had to know. I had to know what he saw.” He then began recalling his encounters with the creature in the corner of his eye.



He would sit hours at a time in complete silence, just staring ahead, or sometimes reading papers related to his investigation when he would feel that unmistakable feeling of being watched. As soon as it happened he would turn to look at it. Sometimes it would be down the hall behind him, sometimes from the kitchen pantry, sometimes even just to his left. But he would never catch anything. One time, however, while he was falling asleep. He felt it right behind him. In his eyes-half-opened stupor he turned around to look at it again and at the entryway of the hall, he saw it.



“It didn’t step out from the dark of the hall. But it was large. Impossibly so. It seemed to stretch farther than my hallway itself, but somehow not breaking my door… and.. And. Its inky blackness seemed to stretch higher than even the ceiling itself, abruptly being cut off by the hall’s ceiling but not slowing it down. I couldn’t see any identifying details due to only seeing it for a split second, but it seemed shapeless with appendages sticking out in random angles. But what I could make out were its eyes…” He finished.



“What about them?” I asked, scared to know more, but desperate to hear. He pulled out a folded piece of paper from under the couch.



“I… I don’t like looking at it, but I drew what its eyes looked like.” He looked away and I unfolded the piece of paper. Recoiling at the sight. It was a single circular blob with another blob growing into it like a cancerous tumor. The iris was a deep shade of crimson and the small bit of white in the eye was bloodshot. The main blob’s pupil was massive and horizontal like a goat’s, while the smaller blob had a pupil more like a human’s. And blob was the only appropriate word to describe these shapes. The main one had a deep gash along the bottom where part of the eye’s fluid was bobbing out and threatening to spill. And they both stared directly into my soul.



“There had to be hundreds just like it, littering along its body into the hall, like hundreds of tiny creatures staring at me. They were just placed on the body with no sockets, like they were stickers, impossibly hanging there without falling.” I couldn’t stop staring at the eye. Eyes? But I pulled myself away and refolded the paper, placing it back under the couch. I shakily wiped my mouth with my hand, now a lot paler.



My thoughts were interrupted by a soft and scared chuckle. “I’m happy to know I’m not crazy for being scared shitless.”



I took a pensive pause before questioning him, “why do you need me then? It sounds like you got all of your answers? This creature seems to be why your friend disappeared if I’m to believe you. Why am I here?”



“Because I need someone to witness it.”



“What?”



“It hasn’t stopped leaving me alone!” He whimpered. “I see it in my dreams, so I haven’t been sleeping. I taste the blood from its drooping eyes when I try to eat food. I feel it staring at me from every corner. But the worst… The worst is that I hear it. Even now, I hear it. It whispers to me.”



“What does it say?”



“Be not afraid” 



I stared at him. “Even now?”



“Even now. It’s like hundreds of different voices overlapping, saying the same thing over and over and over and over. The worst part is it's like a whisper. Like it’s coming from the other room, so I keep having to resist the urge to turn and find the source of the noise and it’s driving me insane!”



“And why do you expect me to do it too?!” I was breathing heavier now. Each word he spoke was pounding into my very soul, feeling heavier and heavier with each passing word. Was he gonna force me to? Hold me down and feed me to this monster of insanity? I reached down for a gun I didn’t bring. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid!



“I don’t.” He said. My heart skipped a beat thinking I misheard him. “I don’t expect you to. I don’t even think you should. But I think you will.” He put his hands up in a defensive stance as if telling me to pause while he explained himself. “I want, no, I need someone to witness it. To know that I’m not insane. To know that I existed. To know that I had found it when no one else had. That someone figured it out. I was there that night when my friend disappeared. I’m sure I must’ve seen something as well, but I wasn’t affected by it until I went chasing after it. I… I don’t know for sure, but I think since it is focused on me, it won’t focus on you. Just like with my friend. I was in the other room, sure, but I was still near enough that it should’ve gotten me too. I want you to write about it. I feel like, just like with my friend, you’ll forget about me if it gets me, but I’m hoping. Maybe if you write about it quickly enough, you won’t forget about the monster. And that in some twisted way, I live on through that.”



“You just want me to write about your death?” I said an incredulous lilt to my voice.



“Yes. And I think you will.”



“You don’t even know me? Why do you think you know so much about me?” I retorted. Angry that someone would have so little trust in my morality that I would just watch a guy die and then write about it.



“Because you’re like me. You have to know. You posted to the most random message boards I’ve seen online, walked door to door to find out more, mine included, though I’m sure you don’t remember, and harassed people constantly just to find out more about these people. Well, I’m offering you the answer. And I know you. Us. We can’t just walk away now. Even if it is the last thing we do. We must listen to temptation and take a bite of the forbidden fruit of knowledge.”



I stare at him for a minute, initially unsure what to do. If I should run. If I should calmly leave. If I should just call the police and be done with it. But I do none of those things. Instead, with a shaky breath, I look at him in those same eyes the beast peered into.



“When do we start?”



…



Although my bold words gave the impression that I was ready, I was anything but. I felt like I was having a panic attack. I had long since untucked my shirt and rolled up my sleeves trying to get some sense of comfort while I sat on the couch next to Isaac doing my best to ignore the engulfing void of a hallway that sat behind us. A million thoughts ran through my mind, but I kept trying to refocus them on the instructions he gave me only an hour ago:



“Stare at one spot on the wall to just focus on. Really, really focus on it. Then, relax your eyes and allow them to drift toward the center of your vision. Don’t force them to move towards the center of your vision. As you relax, your eye muscles should naturally drift towards the center. This is when your vision should start to blur and potentially displace. Since this is possibly the first time you’ve done this you might experience something called nystagmus. Basically, your eyes might vibrate back and forth really quickly for a second or two before returning back to focus. Just ignore it and try again and try to keep a steady blur. You’ll need it to see the creature. Just clear your mind the best you can and keep trying. When you feel it looking at you, don’t turn quickly. Fight your instincts to turn quickly. If you do, you’ll lose your loss of focus. Turn slowly. Get up if you have to. Fight every urge to look away. That’s all you have to do. I will face the creature and accept my fate. I will do what I have to to know what he went through.”



Without fanfare it happened. I thought the creature would wait until night, but apparently not. I don’t know why I thought people only got creepy feelings at night, but I was hoping I had more time. Instead of coming from the hallway behind us like we thought, it came from our right, in the ceiling corner of the kitchen, specifically, just out of sight. It was like a faint tingling in my brain accompanied by a chill in the back of my neck. Something was tickling the right side of my head yelling at me that something is staring at me and I need to find out what. I turned slowly, fighting every instinct telling me to do otherwise, and peered into the kitchen area.



It only took a glance before I lost focus of my unfocus. In the corner of my eye as I turned, I saw a large blackness in what I thought was the vague shape of a man, but I think I just didn’t see enough of it and my brain was filling in the spots of my vision, trying desperately to make sense of the nonsensical. I exhaled a breath I didn’t know I was holding and looked at Isaac. He was staring gobsmacked at the kitchen mumbling. I didn’t initially know what he was muttering until I realized he was holding his bible across his chest. And he was praying.



“Oh heavenly father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done; on earth as it is in heaven. Oh heavenly father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name;...” He kept muttering faster and more desperately as he stared blankly into the kitchen ceiling until he slowly started to tilt his head upwards as if to look at something slowly looming over him.



Trying to steel my resolve I took a deep, shuttering breath, and closed my eyes for a second, trying to imagine I wasn’t here. It would be so easy to just wait for it to pass. To just wait for the inevitable to come for Isaac. But then I thought about that little girl. That little girl saw this creature and had to face it alone. Her parents were gone just for a moment, but she was completely alone with this creature as it took her. Isaac would not be alone.



I stared at the refrigerator deeply to relax my vision, filling my head with thoughts of the little girl in order to empty them of what terrifying monstrosity must be in front of us. As my vision started to blur, it came into view. It was like when you blend colors on a painting. The world around me became so blurry and the colors of his kitchen started to blur with the darkness of the creature. Blacks mixing with grays, mixing with whites, until a kaleidoscope of monochrome blurriness impossibly faced me until the world around me became one blurry picture and the creature in front of me became my sole focus.



I couldn’t look away. I couldn’t focus away from it even if I wanted to. Its body protruded from the corner of the kitchen like a fungal growth, the darkness of the kitchen blurring the source so I wasn’t sure what was the blackness of the creature and the blackness of the darkness. Its thick, tube-like body had slithered out of this corner. Although it was seemingly as thin as an umbilical cord in the corner, it slowly thickened as it got closer to us until the main body stood right in front of us, wider than the entryway from the kitchen to the living room, some of its body spilling over onto the counter next to it, delicately laying across it. And its eyes. The drawing didn’t do it justice. They were completely bare. No eyelashes or eyebrows, just eyes. They were oozing with a bleeding puss that dripped like a leaky faucet from the gash at the bottom of their cornea. They littered the entirety of the creature from the head of it to the corner of the kitchen where an eye was seemingly half in the ceiling. They all stared directly into Isaac’s eyes and then blinked in a wave-like pattern starting from the head.



It somehow kept growing in size. Instead of slithering towards us it seemed to instead grow until it pierced the line of light created by the sun coming in through the living room window, the only thing separating us from our tormentor. But not even that would slow it. Instead, its black body instantaneously was revealed for what it actually is. Instead of a gradual reveal like how light works with everything else, it seemingly blinked into existence the moment it touched direct sunlight. 



It was flesh. It was all flesh. It wasn’t just eyes that littered it. Ears. Mouths. Noses. Hair. But not just that. Beaks. Wings. Feathers. Fur. Claws. Teeth. Leaves. Fungus. And so much more. The skin of the flesh was a gray-ish pink yet lacking the blue veins such a sickly skin should have. Most horrifyingly, beneath the skin I could see the indents of faces. Like when you stick your hand against clay, it leaves an imprint, this creature had those all throughout its endless body. Faces and hands pressed against the skin desperate to get out and escape. It wasn’t just human faces either, animal faces and hooves and teeth of creatures that I have never seen nor could compare anything to pushed against the membrane. They screamed soundlessly as they clawed and begged to be released from their fleshy prison. I was paralyzed on the couch as it slowly engulfed my vision and seemingly all around me and Isaac. All I could see was the flesh and the pulsating faces trying their hardest to claw their way out of their meaty prisons. 



This is Hell. It has to be. 



Hundreds of eyes all around us started to spin like a series of wheels yet they all ignored me. They all focused their gaze on Isaac. They spun faster and faster until they made a low vibrating sound:“Be not afraid.”



Isaac and I looked straight up, compelled by the creature to obey. 



The spinning and Isaac’s prayers ceased immediately as he declared, with complete certainty: “God. Is that you?” 

At his words, a hundred hands protruded from the ground, the couch, the flesh and began grasping at Isaac ripping and tearing at his clothes. Meanwhile, no less than twenty hands formed in a circle at the fleshy ceiling and began tugging, and tugging, until with a soundless tear, the flesh ripped open and revealed an endless maw. There were no teeth, but inside… Was the night sky. Stars. Hundreds. Thousands. Millions of them. 



Isaac, now naked, reached for the ceiling to touch those stars. All at once, those stars exploded. Galaxies were decimated. Galaxies were reformed from the dust and entire new stars reformed and exploded. My head felt like it was going to explode with it. I was bearing witness to the birth and death of anything and everything and my mind could not take the mental load. Isaac’s former gasp of admiration at the sight now became screams of terror until eventually the stars all ceased and all that remained was total blackness.



The hands did not stop at his clothes, now scratching and tearing at his skin. Patches of flesh became ripped from his body in random patterns, each leathery patch of Isaac’s skin was then placed on and absorbed by the creature’s body. While being ripped apart, the hands began lifting Isaac’s body toward the black hole in the ceiling, never ceasing their pulling and tugging. Hair was ripped out. A fingernail pulled from its bed. An eye was pulled from its socket, its stringy nerves snapped. All of it joined the amalgamation of flesh. Even his own eye, after placing, turned and stared back at its former body. Isaac’s screaming never ceased. Even after he reached the hole, he screamed. His body was much too large for the hole that was no bigger than an infant, but the creature did not care. It pushed and pushed. Until, like a series of twigs, all four of his limbs and his neck snapped back. With a skull piercing croak, Isaac fell silent, his now limp and eyeless head hanging upside down as it stared back at me. With Isaac now dead, the room was filled with the sound of squishy flesh being ripped from his body and blood dripping onto the floor. This entire time, somehow, not a single sound came from the creature itself. He slowly drifted the rest of the way into the hole and as his body passed the threshold, the eyes turned to me. But before every one of them could perceive my presence, my eyes started to vibrate. 



It was like Isaac said. Nystagmus. My eyes started to vibrate uncontrollably and after only half of the creature’s eyes noticed me, my eyes suddenly refocused, and the creature was gone. The room was painfully banal. The silence, deafening. And despite the creature and all of its flesh missing from the room, the blood somehow no longer on the floor, and sunlight basking in through the window, I could only notice the rest of Isaac’s head slowly drifting through the ceiling like a rock slowly sinking into sand.



As his head passed through the ceiling, the last of his hair sucked up into oblivion, something crashed onto the coffee table. I finally screamed. The object hitting it triggered my extremely delayed reaction to seeing the monster. I screamed. I cried. I sobbed. I prayed to a God I didn’t believe in. I laid there on the couch and then the floor for what felt like hours, occasionally clawing at my own head wishing that, somehow, the things that I saw would leave it. Crawling over to the coffee table I looked and saw that what the creature dropped was Isaac’s bible. The leather binding was torn to shreds and opening it, seemingly all of the pages had seemingly been chewed or ripped out. But a single shred of paper remained inside.



I do not hear the voices like he did, thankfully. But, I do, still, dream of it. I am scared of the dark and I do not dare allow myself to get too bored or tired. I feel the creature watching me occasionally. It seems I haven’t fully escaped its attention. I write this because it is the only thing Isaac wanted from me. The only thing I can give to him. I’m begging. Please, learn from us. Not all answers are meant to be known. Despite what Isaac and his friend said before they were consumed, I do not think we found God. But we may have found what God fears. If you feel something staring at you, don’t go looking for it. 



Isaac’s not even his real name. I didn’t use it here for fear it would disappear like the photo on his mantle. His name was \[      \]. I hope to never forget what he looked like. I’ll never forget what it looked like. And I’ll never forget the message it left for me:



“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep”

Polite always means ulterior motives?,"Forget about dating. Most claim that they cannot date someone without being friends. Fine.

But have never understood how older women in their 30s or even married/committed women in their 20s are fine with friendly talks. But single younger women/girls in 20s aren't friendly?

Of course personal choice applies here. No one should be forced to have a conversation. But this is still a weird mystery.

What does it mean if a soft-spoken, polite, kind, self-aware, mindful, respectful guy talks in a friendly way for the first-time without being pushy, compulsive is antagonized?

Ok, I wouldn't be the one to have low self-respect to compel someone into a conversation, but how many unwritten rules exist when it comes to basic small talk?

It's 21st century and people are apparently ""modern"" but still it's antagonized to invite someone for coffee or lunch or a snack in a nearby cafe or even a polite small talk in a safe space (yes. non-compulsively, for the 1st time) ?

Of course, no means no.

But being judgemental even after the approach was not pushy or compulsive? Doesn't exactly sound ""modern"". A simple ""no"" would suffice for first-time, polite approaches.

Fine, but at least let's discuss all these ""unwritten rules"" that people have in mind for basic small talk.

Go ahead! Would be even better if we have some context or personal anecdote.

Note: Mutual respect applies to both the parties. Judging some who approaches politely is the exact same behaviour as judging someone who refuses/declines politely.",1,1752695598.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

My girlfriend and I (both 28) are moving from Austin to Portland in September. We’ve been living in the Domain area the past year — super clean, planned, very low crime and no homelessness. Honestly it’s kind of a bubble, so we’re looking forward to being in a real city neighborhood with character, walkability, local bars, great coffee and actual streets you can enjoy.

We picked Slabtown because it felt like a good balance: close to nature (Forest Park), close to downtown without being in the middle of Old Town/Chinatown, lots of restaurants and breweries, still pretty new and growing. We have a car and i might buy a bike.

Of course, we’ve read and heard a ton — about property crime, break-ins, visible homelessness, tents, open drug use on sidewalks. We’re not naive or easily shocked, but we just want to be prepared for what everyday life is really like right now.

Would love to hear from anyone actually living in Slabtown or nearby NW Portland right now:

* Are sidewalks generally clean and chill, or is there a lot of trash, tents, or people dealing with mental health issues out in the open widely?
* How bad are package thefts or car break-ins? (We’ll have a car parked there, so trying to keep realistic expectations)
* Do you see much open drug use, and does it ever feel threatening?
* How about just walking around early in the morning or later at night safe or does it get sketchy?
* Any particular blocks or corners to avoid or apartment buildings that handle security better?

We’re honestly super excited to be moving — we love the idea of being able to walk everywhere, have amazing coffee and cocktails right around the corner, and live somewhere with a real creative, outdoorsy energy. Just want to be smart and know what to expect.

Pounding came from the other side of the door. Henry’s desperate voice could be heard screaming the name of Carmilla. She was surprised to hear his voice so early. These days she had only called upon him at night. Now he was here, in the middle of the day. *No matter*. 

She rose from her slumber and glided across the floor to the door. With a quick pull of the locks, and a turn of the knob, Henry practically fell into her arms.

“Carmilla.” he said, nearly crying through his words.

“Henry,” she took his head in her hands, “What is the matter?” He was more visibly distressed than usual, which alarmed Carmilla. Henry had become a more emotional man since their first encounters, but he had never broken down like this. She knew exactly how to settle him. “Come, lay down your head.”

It was like clock work. Henry had become so accustomed to this routine that it merely seemed like another uncontrolled movement of his body as he laid across the couch in Carmilla’s living room.

“Hand me your arm.” Carmilla cooed in a soft and pleasant tone.

“Carmilla I-” Henry’s words were met with a frigid gaze. Carmilla’s eyes spoke with authority. *Silence*. A single tear rolled down his face as, once again, the words from his throat were stolen away and cast into oblivion. He shut up his mouth and closed his eyes, giving into the helplessness. 

That is when he felt it, the sharp pain followed by the instant ecstasy. Pain fell away from his body, warmth circulated through his system. The doubt, fear, shame, regret, all disappeared if only for a moment. What did it matter if it always hurt afterwards? Why did he care what others thought of him when this feeling felt so good? Damn his learning, damn his responsibilities, damn the world. If only he could feel like this forever. 

As it always did, however, it had to end. “Henry?” Carmilla whispered, using her hand to rub away the blood on her chin. “Henry, I want you to go home, and I want you to rest. Will you rest for me?”

With the feeling gone, there was only pain. The blanket of joy that surrounded him was cast off, and now the chilling winds of sadness burned away at his skin. As tears began to roll down his face, he had no choice but to say, “yes, Madam.”

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Victor felt strangely at home. His lab had been set up just as it had been in Ingolstadt. He had created a steady routine for his work, which could not have been said for Henry, and there was something horribly familiar about body parts strewn about his work space. A fact that was immediately disgusting to Victor on second thought.

That was when he heard a crash in the hallway. *That damned monster. He believes himself to be as crafty as a fox, and yet here he is smashing about like a lout.* He threw off his gloves and set everything aside.

When he entered the hallway it was not the monster, but Henry, who laid across the floor. He had managed to topple a coat rack and demolish a small side table, all while failing to close the door behind him. He was drenched in water from head to toe. Victor went to close the door and noticed it was only a light drizzle of rain. How long had he been out there?

“Henry. Henry!” Victor began to lightly smack him, attempting to pull him from whatever coma he found himself in. 

Finally Henry’s eyes opened, and with vague lucidity muttered, “Victor?”

“The hell's wrong with you?” Victor had him by the collar of his shirt, holding him off the ground. “Do you really think I have time to take care of a drunk?” Victor became overwhelmed with frustration. The odd thing was he could smell no alcohol on his breath. “Or is it Morphine? Cocaine? We’ve been in London, what? 2 months? And you are already strung out? You already can’t walk straight when you get home late at night?” It was at this moment he looked into Henry’s eyes. Really looked into them. Examined them.

The same soul behind every eye was there, and it was crying out. It didn’t matter that Henry managed a faint “help me.” it was already in his eyes. He had been screaming it since before Victor had grabbed him. He seemed just as trapped as the monster. To what vice he didn’t know, but at least it wasn’t so obvious a prison as the monster's appearance. “I’m sorry, Victor.”

Victor was stunned into neutrality. The rage he had just felt was gone in a moment. This was not some creature extorting him. This was his friend. “No, Henry. I-... I am sorry.” He pulled Henry up on his shoulder, and led him to his room. Once he was there, out of his damp clothes with a fire to rest by, Victor sat with him a long, silent moment. 

“Henry?” The weak eyes of Henry looked up to meet Victor. “What’s wrong? Why are you… what has happened?” Henry waited a moment. Once again he searched for words that he knew he couldn’t speak. 

“I can't stop…” is all he managed to say.

“I know, and… and it’s okay. I am here for you.” Victor looked into the coals, then back to his friend. “I’ll come back in the morning. You will see this through. *We,”* he stood on that word a while “we will see this through. Sleep now. You have to sleep as much as you can.” Victor closed the door behind him and saw to finishing his work for the evening.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“So do you think we should follow him for a few more days or do you think we know his schedule pretty well by now?” Sherlock had just finished lighting his pipe, staying well under the canopy of a small coffee house which protected them from the rain.

“He’s only gone two places.” John Seward sat at a table, taking a moment's rest. “Two apartments, and I don’t know which one he lives in. Perhaps both?” 

Van Helsing Kept his gaze locked on the door. “The only other person we know about is from Dr. Watson. Victor Frankenstein. Allegedly the travelling partner of Mr. Clerval. I think we just saw him close the door to the apartment.”

Sherlock let out a series of quick puffs. “Still a potential suspect, but not our man if our theory of serial murders is to hold up. They’ve only been here a couple months. Still, could be a copy cat murderer trying to get rid of his ‘friend’ while shifting the blame to someone else.” The two detectives looked to Sherlock. “What? I didn’t say it was a good theory.” 

“And yet we know nothing of the other apartment.” John Seward covered his mouth with his hands and leaned into them on the table. “How can someone be renting out an apartment and have no clue who lives there?”

“Perhaps Victor and Henry can help us find out?” And off Sherlock strode towards the front door.

I’d love to meet someone who shares that energy: calm, emotionally present, and open to a gentle, slow-growing connection that might blossom into something romantic.

# Here's some interests that I have:

* RPGs like FFXIV, Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail (more for the story than the grind)
* Anime (Re:Zero, Frieren, Shield Hero, fantasy, or character-driven series)
* Co-op games, soft aesthetics, creative worldbuilding, or storytelling
* Casual Magic the Gathering player (even though my decks seem to be too strong for their own good)
* Voice chats once or twice a week to talk, play, or just vibe quietly

Maybe if we vibe well enough, we could meet in-person at a con!

I’m especially drawn to people who are emotionally available, kind, sincere, and a little whimsical. Bonus points if you love thoughtful characters, quiet moments, and the idea of building something real over time.

Are there potential issues with power surges or damaging the appliance this way? Or are there more refined solutions that allow some degree of monitoring and control?

Beyond simple on/off control, integration gets trickier, right?

1m1mfta,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m1mfta,Jsaux Battery Upgrade Kit,"
I've been using this battery upgrade from Jsaux for 3 weeks now… some comments:

It comes with a kit that includes EVERYTHING you need, no additional items required.

• The instructions are relatively easy to follow. You can make the switch in under 30 minutes. I took about an hour because I was being very careful.

Everything feels like good quality, except for the back cover it includes.

IMPORTANT: It adds weight and YOU CAN FEEL IT — it goes from about 600g to around 750g.

Besides the battery, it includes a heatsink to lower temperatures. It works really well from what I've experienced so far — it keeps the device cool (I live in the tropics where it's 31°C year-round).

The back cover it includes feels simpler, it doesn’t have the details that the original one has.

The most important part: battery life is much better… you go from 1.5 hours at 25 watts to 2 hours and 45 minutes at 15 watts. Perfect for grabbing a coffee and playing Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth 🥰


Would I recommend this kit?

Yes… but it's not for everyone. It adds weight, so if you're someone who really cares about weight, I honestly wouldn’t recommend it. But aside from that, it’s fantastic.

   Cathy found my house familiar and would revert to an introverted mindset and barely spoke and hid in her room as if I were an estranged uncle.  It’s something I had gotten used to and planned to do some soul searching in my old town. 

   Once in the house, I pointed upstairs so Cathy could run to the guestroom and pretend that no one in the house existed.  My mom gave me a hug that could make the toughest man cry as if his dog died, and my father came down and spun me around and told me to get ready for dinner.   

   I made my way upstairs and glanced in my brother’s room, where he was spying on the neighbors with his binoculars.  I passed Cathy’s room, which was locked and blaring My Chemical Romance, and made my way to my room which impressed me with how similar it looked to when I left twenty-five years ago. 

   I went downstairs and sat at the secondary table.  My parents made small talk with my uncle while I finished my potatoes and made my plans to sneak out.  I went to the backyard only to run into dad as he was grabbing another beer.   

“Hey bud!  Watcha doing?” 

“Hey.  I was just thinking of going for a walk to check out the old neighborhood,” 

“Ya might be too late.” 

Dad grabbed his beer and walked inside without giving me another look.  I left out the side gate. 

I recognized the cracked facade with all its manholes, shattered windows, and the gangs of children mowing about.  Somethings never change, and I don’t feel very bad about that.  I take another turn and hear that old dog that used to growl at me every time I moved a muscle near that house.  Somehow, the dog's growl felt deeper and more deliberate, as if he’d been waiting for me for some delusional revenge.  Its fangs reminded me ‘Cujo’.  I fought the urge to get a sandwich at ‘Pat’s Deli’ and made my way to the front steps of 42 Cuckoo Bird Ln.  Worse than I remember. 

   I jumped into the old shack of a building to search for the old hole where I’d speak with Martha and hear stories of this town when she was young and in love with a man who joined the service.  Her fiancé was considered missing in action and the grief caused her to spiral into homelessness.  She took refuge at this address. 

 

\*\*\*\* 

   I left the safety of my group and knocked on a door near a wide dark hole.  She spoke. 

   “I’ve been here for twenty years.  I enjoy some of the people who come here.  Even though, none of them notice me.” 

“Why don’t you leave?” 

“I wouldn’t know how to reenter society.  There are rules that change every so often.  I have been gone for a whole generation.....I would be lost out there.” 

“I’m sure the rules haven’t changed that much.  Where still the same place.” 

“No, you’re not.  You just aren’t old enough to know better.  I didn’t just hide.  I have not so much as read a newspaper.  I don’t even know what it looks like outside.” 

“It’s a bit rundown out there.” 

“Do they still have those beautiful hedges out front?  I know things started to look shabby, but certainly not everything?” 

“Eh.  The town’s sort of rundown.  At least, this part of town.  My dad wanted a bargain, so he chose the cul-de-sac with an abandoned car and a rundown house.” 

“That’s a shame.  I know we weren’t the prettiest town, but I always enjoyed the peace of this place.” 

“With all the people leaving, there’s more peace than you could ever ask for.” 

\*\*\*\* 

The hole is gone.  I knocked on the door to see if she was behind the door, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. 

“Can I help you?” 

“I’m looking for someone.” 

“You need to check at the front desk.” 

I walk back to the front and ring the bell. 

“Can I help you?” 

“I’m looking for Martha.” 

“Do you have a last name or room number?” 

“Uh....She’s staying around the corner.  It was the room that had a hole in it.” 

“That no longer exists.” 

“.............” 

“You can’t go back.” 

Something told me I shouldn’t be here.  I stumbled out the glass doors, and down the tiled steps and looked back to observe the fancy hotel that stood in the place of the old shack that carried my old things. 

   I made my way back to my father’s house, passing the new houses built for the new tech employees, and the apartment buildings made to look rustic.  I peaked at the cafe that replaced the greasy deli I’d be at after school.  I opened my dad’s new Mohogany door and saw Cathy saying goodbye to my family.  My dad smiled at me. 

“Find what you were looking for?” 

“No.” 

“I told ya.” 

   Cathy and I walked past the ‘For Sale’ sign and jumped in the car.   

“Are you feeling better?” 

I looked at Cathy and smiled as a response.  As we drove past the new coffee shop on the corner, I had the thought that I’d never feel better.  You can’t get closure when the place doesn’t exist.      ",1,1752694736.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

What advice and recommendations do you have for ARMY visiting London for Run Jin on tour?,"It's just under three weeks until Jin is coming to the O2 Arena – and he's bringing ARMY from all around Europe and beyond with him!

Help an ARMY out and let them know about safety, how to get around, where to eat, tourist attractions, BTS-related things to do, or anything else that you think someone should know when they visit!

I'll be compiling suggestions in this post, so if you have any recommendations, add them in the comments and I'll add them up here! And of course, if you have any questions, feel free to ask them and we'll do our best to find an answer. Forgive me for the essay that's about to follow 🙇‍♀️

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Keep in mind that you will be in London during peak tourist season, as schools in Europe \*and\* the UK are on their summer holidays. It's likely that things will be busier than usual. :) 

Also, please do your best to have some water on you. **Most of the London Underground has no air conditioning**, so the trains get HOT. Buses often aren't much better, sadly. Having water and a fan (electric or traditional) can go a long way. You can also walk into any Starbucks / Pret and ask for your bottle to be refilled with tap water, free of charge (and no purchase necessary either). 

If you ever do feel unwell on the Tube, please get off. The stations are often much cooler, and there's staff there who can help you. 💜

# Overall Safety 

London's a big place, so having your wits about you is smart. It's not super dangerous, especially not in the areas most tourists will be in, so just being a little aware of yourself and your belongings goes a long way. 

One of the biggest issues are pickpockets and phone snatching, which means someone on a bike, scooter or moped will rip your phone out of your hands. (This has happened to me once and it's very unpleasant. 🥲) 

If you get your phone out to check directions or something, it's best if you step away from the road, and hold it with two hands. Snatchers rely on people holding their phone very gently, so if you have a better grip on it, it'll be a deterrent. One of those lanyards or a phone grip / popsocket can also help. This has sometimes happened on the Tube, too, so if someone feels suspicious, trust your gut instinct. 

That's not to say your phone will DEFINITELY be gone btw; it's just good to have a bit of awareness, since it's so unique to the UK. 

Apart from that, common sense applies: zip up your bags, and if someone comes into a coffee shop and acts weird, take your phone off the table as they might try to distract you so they can nick it. 

If you have a backpack, I'd advise against wearing it at the front – you'll make yourself identifiable as a tourist pretty much instantly.

Also be aware of 'charity collectors' outside train stations. If they approach you, don't engage, just walk with purpose and they'll leave you be. I know it feels rude, but it's the way to go; they're not criminals, really, but a lot of them are scammers, so not engaging is best. :) 

# The Location

Location: The O2 Arena  
Capacity: 20,000

Times: Doors open at 18:30 (the time on your ticket). Show times will be available to view [on the event website](https://www.axs.com/uk/series/27497/jin-at-the-o2-tickets?skin=theo2) closer to the date, usually on the day but sometimes the day before, so please double check them a few hours before.  

The O2 can look a little confusing – it's a concert venue and shopping centre in one. Think of it as a donut; the donut ring is the shopping centre, and the donut hole is the arena. 

Because of this, there are \*two\* possible security checkpoints. The first one is at the main entrance, and depends on the staff; follow their guidance. If they send you to the left, you'll need to get your bag scanned through an Xray machine, and you yourself will walk through a metal detector. If they don't, you can just go in. 

For the actual arena, no metal detectors! Just sensor gates (like the anti-theft gates in stores); you'll get your tickets scanned, and then just walk through and staff might pull you out for further checks. 

# Where Will ARMY Meet? 

Fans usually meet outside the arena - both outdoors and inside the shopping centre. There are lots of billboards that will show adverts as well as the act playing the arena that night, so taking your photo with one of those is a popular activity. There's also usually fans dancing, and lots of freebie trading. 

# In The Arena

The O2 Arena is very comfortable, but \*very\* steep in the upper bowl (seat numbers starting with 4). The entrances are very low – for Row A and B you will need to walk down some steps, and for anything Row D upwards you will have to walk upstairs. Don't feel like you need to rush! I personally find going down worse than going up, but other people find going up worse.

If you find that you cannot deal with the height\*, or have any other concern, you can always speak to Guest Services – at block 101 on Level 1, or block 410 on Level 4. They're also your go-to support if you need help with anything else. 

^(\*They'll do their best to help, but there's no guarantee that they CAN help, so bear this in mind! You can always take it slow up and down the stairs, people will understand.) 

You can also get **free hearing protection**! Head to block 118 on Level 1; ear plugs are free of charge (they're basic foam ones, but they're decent if you're in a pinch), and you can also borrow ear defenders if you leave a form of ID as a token. 

If anyone has medicine they need to refrigerate, contact guest services and let them know, and they'll tell you where to find the medical room for your section. 

For our ARMY who might get overstimulated, feel anxious, or simply need help to get out of / recover from an unsafe or uncomfortable situation, the O2 Arena has their Safe Space –[ you can find more about this here](https://www.theo2.co.uk/news/detail/introducing-the-o2s-safe-space), but if you think you might need it, head to the Welcome Desk as soon as you arrive and let them know. (It's also good to know that the Safe Space **stocks menstrual products**, so if you find yourself in a pickle and there's no ARMY who can help you out – guest services are your friends!)

# What can I bring in? 

Your bag can be **up to A4 in size**. You can bring \*one\* bag, but if you find yourself receiving lots of freebies, or treating yourself to a lot of merch, it might be wise to have a second bag (like a little fold-up shopping bag) on you. 

Your bag doesn't have to be clear, but please have a loot at some of the things you cannot bring in (like iPads) [on the O2 website here](https://help.theo2.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/23248661587229-Security-at-The-O2-Keeping-you-safe). 

**You cannot bring ANY outside food or drink into the Arena proper** (into the shopping centre is okay); you also can't bring any reusable bottles. They will take any food off you, so if you decide to chance it, be prepared to lose your snacks. 

Crushable bottles (eg plastic bottles or those foldable ones you can get) are okay, but they need to be empty when you go through security and you might have the lid taken off. 

There are free water fountains inside for you to refill your bottles, plus bars and a small self-serve convenience store that sell food and drinks. If the queues for the water fountains are too long, or you're too far away from one, you can always ask the bar staff to refill your bottle; tap water is free! 

**If you need to bring in food and water for medical or religious reasons, contact customer services as soon as possible for an exemption.**

To keep your ARMY bomb (just don't call it that if anyone asks!) glowing brightly all night, you can usually bring in a set of replacement batteries. You can find them in most supermarkets, but you might need to ask as especially smaller shops tend to keep them behind the checkout. Since they'll be selling lightsticks on the day, they usually also sell batteries in the merch shops, if you've forgotten yours. 

For those who are like me (very forgetful and a little confused), your ARMY bomb needs three AAA batteries.  

# Merch

Hold on to your wallets and your Wootteos!

There are a number of merch stores in and around the O2. The most popular is right next to the main entrance; there's a smaller one (which also has merch for past events) inside the arena. 

Then, you'll find a merch shop on Level 1 and 4 of the Arena, plus sometimes on Level 2; there might also be a merch van outside. 

The O2 is entirely cashless, but I cannot for the life of me remember if that applies to the merch shops outside. You definitely won't have any issues paying by card though. 

# But HOW Do I Get There? And How Do I Navigate London?

First of all, Google Maps is convenient as ever, but most Londoners (me included) swear by an app called Citymapper! It's usually a bit faster at picking up disruptions, and it offers you lots of routes to choose from. If you're walking, you can also choose a 'main roads only' option, \*and\* it shows you estimated taxi fares! 

The nearest station to the O2 is... right outside. Convenient, right?  

You will be travelling to **North Greenwich**, which is served by the **Jubilee Line** (that's the silver one) only. [Here is a full Tube map](https://content.tfl.gov.uk/standard-tube-map.pdf) – it's very large, but North Greenwich is in square D7. 

This is the fastest and easiest way to get there, unless you are staying really close. 

If, for any reason, the Jubilee Line does not run, there are other ways to get to the O2. The important thing to know here is that there is **no convenient river crossing except two tunnels for cars (and buses)**, which means that even if something looks close, it might be very hard to get to. 

There is a bus station right outside (on the other side of the Underground Station), served by a number of routes. 

You can also take a boat; if you go from London Bridge Pier, you'll pass under Tower Bridge, after which the boats also speed up. The travel time is around 25 minutes, and it'll cost you around £10. 

(There is also the DLR, which is the line indicated by the double teal (?) lines on the map. Your closest station at the moment is Greenwich, which is a 50 minute walk away... this is your 'absolutely nothing else works' option.)

Taxis are an option, too, of course; the iconic black cabs (which aren't always physically black!) now often come as electric cars with big panorama windows, and Uber is an option too. 

And finally, you can also reach the O2 by **cable car.** Yes, really! For that, you need to take the DRL to Royal Victoria, from which you'll take the cable car over to the other side of the river and, once again, follow it with a short walk. It's a £7 fare per way. 

# Talking of fares... 

This is what often confuses a lot of people, so I'll make it easy. 

First of all, you can only pay by card. You'll either need an Oyster Card for this (which you can get at every station – no need to pre-order), or you can use your credit or debit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Wallet... Just double check what if your bank changes you a fee for currency conversion, and \*how\* it's changed. 

You will be charged at the end of the day (around 3am, usually), so you won't see how much you spent throughout... but luckily, there are caps on how much you CAN spend. 

An hour of taking the bus costs £1.75. It doesn't matter how far you go or how many buses you take – once you tap your card on the reader, you have an hour to take as many buses as your heart desires. 

If you take only buses all day, you'll pay £5.25 as your maximum fare (that's three hours). That means that after that, every other bus journey is free. 

You do NOT need to tap your card again when you leave the bus – only when you board.

For the Underground, you will need to tap your card at the ticket gate when you go in, and once again when you leave. 

The way fares work is by zones you travelled through. Most of you will probably stay in Zone 1 or 2, which means the maximum you will pay per day is £8.90; if you travel between Zones 1 and 3, it'll go up to £10.50. After that, like with buses, the journeys are free – but if you go into the next Zone, your daily max will increase. (Please someone tell me if this doesn't make sense.) 

How much you pay per journey on the Tube also depends on \*when\* you travel. Journeys between 6.30 and 9.30 and 4pm and 7pm are called peak times, and they are slightly more expensive (but your cap doesn't change). As you might have guessed, these are also the rush hour times, so trains will be busier. 

If you use Citymapper, the app will show you how much your single journey will cost! Alternatively, [Transport for London has a fare finder on its website. ](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/tube-and-rail-fares/single-fare-finder)

# Getting OUT Of The O2 

Prepare yourself for this to take some time. Getting out of the arena is quick and easy, but the way to the Tube will take some time. It's very well organised though; if you have an issue with the crowds, or something doesn't feel right, speak to the staff in high-vis vests and they'll do their best to help you. 

It's a good idea to refill your water bottle before you're leaving – if you can't do it in the arena, there is a Starbucks right next to the main entrance that's open until after the concert. 

# Beyond The Stage (and sometimes closeby)

We've reached the more fun bit that's not just me telling you about the venue, but 

# Concert Day Food 

Since you can't bring in food, you might want to have dinner before the show without missing out on ARMY shenanigans. There are a lot of places to eat in the O2 – most of them are chains and pretty good, but I personally can recommend 

[Busaba](https://www.busaba.com/locations/busaba-at-the-o2), a Thai restaurant 

[Haidilao](https://haidilao-hot-pot-london.shop/) hot pot (you usually get a discount here if you go to the concert!)

[Zizzi](https://www.zizzi.co.uk/italian/restaurants/the-o2), an Italian chain 

All of them are suitable for vegans and vegetarians. A lot of restaurants in London will also offer halal meat, so it's worth asking if they don't have it signposted. 

It can be very tricky to find food after 10pm beyond friend chicken shops, so I recommend getting something beforehand (or having some provisions in your hotel). 

You can also head to Canary Wharf, which is just one stop away and has plenty of dining options – or you can head into Central London and grab dinner there, before heading back.

# General Food Recommendations

**Korean**

[Olle](http://ollelondon.com/menu/) – the guys have visited this! Very good BBQ, and they also serve a la carte comfort food, although that's a little \*too\* pricey for my taste.  

[Little Korea](https://littlekorea.co.uk/) – again, a few of the members have been here. Very solid Korean food, but sadly also quite expensive due to the location. Still, their Jjajangmyeon are delicious! 

[Eatopia](https://www.instagram.com/eatopia.london/) – a small Korean takeaway. Really delicious, with generous portions. In summer they sell bingsoo \*and\* they sell hotteok. Super delicious! Their kimbap is also really chubby, which I'm convinced makes it extra delicious. 

[Arang](https://arangrestaurant.shop/) \- Korean restaurant that serves BBQ and a la carte. Only place I've seen naengmeyon! They also have halal beef, so great for Muslim ARMY who want to try K-BBQ. 

[Seoul Bakery ](https://www.instagram.com/seoulbakerylondon/?hl=en)– honestly a Korean icon in London. Canteen-style restaurant with 15 or 16 seats; cheap, cheerful, and the walls are drawn on (if you have a pen or a post-it, you can leave your own mark). I somehow always spot Jimin's name here, no matter where I sit. 😂 The queue can get long, but for lunch during the week it shouldn't be too bad. CLOSED ON TUESDAYS. 

[Sollip](https://www.sollip.co.uk/) – this one's \*fancy\* and holds a Michelin star. Korean-inspired European restaurant, run by a Korean couple who trained in France. It's a tasting menu, so you'll need time and to be willing to part with £150ish per person, but if you're up for it, it's worth it.

**Asian / Pan-Asian – a lot of these have multiple locations, including in Canary Wharf**

[Tokyo Diner](https://tokyodiner.com/) – incredibly good, longstanding Japanese restaurant (33 years!) focusing on simple, reliable home cooking. (They also don't accept tips!)

[Noodle Inn](https://www.instagram.com/noodleinnuk_/) – super popular spot for Chinese hand-pulled noodles. 

[Bun House](https://bun.house/) – pretty much what it says on the tin: buns (and some other Cantonese specialties). Their custard buns are really popular, but all of them are good... and so is their cheung fun. 

[Tofu Vegan](https://www.tofuvegan.com/home) – for all the vegans, this vegan Chinese place hits the spot. They have a few locations now, so there's choice. 

[Dishoom](https://www.dishoom.com/) – this one might be controversial, but I'm basic and I really like it 😅 a homegrown chain of 'Bombay-style' cafes / restaurants. I have no idea how authentic it is, but everything I've had here was delicious, so in the list it goes. 

[YiQi](https://www.yiqipanasia.co.uk/menu.pdf) – Pan-Asian restaurant focusing on South, South East and East Asia. Super friendly and helpful re dietary and allergy requests last time I went; everyone left very full and happy. 

[Kêu](https://banhmikeu.co.uk/borough/) – Vietnamese near London Bridge; the Char Siu and the Tofu Curry were so good, my friend and I went back the weekend after to have it again. 

[Din Tai Fung](https://dintaifung-uk.com/) – dim sum royalty, really. Super fun with a group, when you can try lots of different things. 

**Everything Else – a few of these have multiple locations, including in Canary Wharf**

[Brother Marcus](https://brothermarcus.co.uk/) – Mediterranean  

[Pizza Pilgrims](https://www.pizzapilgrims.co.uk/) – chain of pizza resraurants with \*the\* best vegan cheese 

[Circolo Popolare](https://www.circolopopolare.com/) – this one's very Instagram-ready and you NEED a reservation, but I've been invited a few times and the food is delicious... more than an Insta spot, at least in my book. 

[St John](https://stjohnrestaurant.com/) – maybe a little more 'adventurous' – the menu is only released on the day. Very worth the money, though. 

[Tatar Bunar](https://www.instagram.com/tatarbunar.london/?hl=en-gb) – Ukrainian in Shoreditch. ^(Varenyky should always come in that size, if you ask me.)

[José Pizarro](https://josepizarro.com/reservations/) – Spanish 

[Joe Allen](https://joeallen.co.uk/) – New York-style institution in Theatreland. It's open late, and you often find yourself sitting among some famous faces. 

[Watch House](https://watchhouse.com/) – London chain of cafes that does a variety of coffee (including rarities), but also has a solid breakfast and brunch menu 

[Ffiona's](https://www.ffionas.com/) – excellent brunch spot in Kensington 

**Snacks / casual food / coffee shops** and cafes 

Reliably, there will be a Pret almost everywhere. It's gotten comparatively expensive, but they have a good selection for a variety of dietary requirements, and because there's so many of them, they can be a godsend.

[Borough Market](https://boroughmarket.org.uk/) – lots of street food on this market. It's somewhat expensive, but there's so much choice... and even if you don't buy anything, just having a wander and a look around is worth it. 

Watch House (mentioned above) also does takeaway coffee, as well as cake, wraps etc.  

[Udderlicious](https://www.udderlicious.co.uk/) – ice cream parlous in Covent Garden, Islington and Crouch End with more 'novelty' flavours... think Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt, Strawberry Lemonade, or Hazelnut Stracciatella (which tastes like Kinder Bueno). They always have a few vegan flavours, too, and you can try things before committing to a whole scoop! ^(The prices are a bit... 😭, but I've been in London for so long that they don't shock me anymore. Plus their scoops are big! Two small scoops are a LOT.)

[Café Pedlar](https://www.instagram.com/cafe.pedlar/) – cosy coffee shop with very good pastries and very generous sandwiches in Waterloo

[Monmouth](https://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/) – incredibly good coffee, and super knowledgeable staff. 

[Wa Cafe](https://www.wacafe.co.uk/) – Japanese patisserie and bakery in Covent Garden, Marylebone and Ealing. They curry buns are delicious! But their cake is, too. 

[Shibuya](https://shibuyasoho.com/) – Japanese cafe and restaurant on Shaftesbury Avenue. It's very small, so the wait for a table can be long, but the desserts are very nice. ^(I've not had their savoury food, but it SMELLS good.) 

[Sakurado](https://www.sakurado.co.uk/) – another Japanese patisserie, with no real seating. I recommend their freshly made mochi (filled with whipped cream and fruit of your choice) and sitting in a park. 

[Bunsik](http://bunsik.co.uk/) – Korean streetfood, including corndogs and rose tteokbokki. The one in Chinatown is the best branch! 

[Chinatown Bakery](https://chinatownbakery.co.uk/) – another institution. Cheap, cheerful baked goods... their buns are very nice, as are their custard-filled tayaki (but let them cool down!) 

[Atis](https://atisfood.com/) – more upmarket chain of salad bars. It's not cheap, but can be very filling, and caters to vegans very well. The stores also all have taps for filtered, chilled water, and they won't say anything if you just walk in to fill up your bottle / get a cup of water. ([The Salad Project](https://www.saladproject.co.uk/) is a similar kind of place.)

  
**A few bubble tea favourites**

[Heytea](https://www.instagram.com/heytea.uk/?hl=en) – Chinese fruit tea, not really boba 

[Truedan](https://www.instagram.com/truedanuk/?hl=en) 

[Day Day Drink ](https://www.daydaydrink.co.uk/)

[Xing Fu Tang](https://www.xingfutang.co.uk/)

YiFang – inside Sidequest Hub (a gaming cafe) on Charing Cross Road. Very nice fruit tea with lots of real fruit! 

# Things To Do – Central 

I'm going to leave out things like Buckingham Palace or Regent's Park – but they're definitely worth doing! Westminster, too, and Horse Guards Parade is always worth a visit – just be mindful that the horses DO bite. If you head to St James' Park, you can take a few nuts and delight the local squirrels, who will gently take them out of your hand. 

[Here is a handy list someone else collated – BTS picture spots](https://www.tumblr.com/amelianotthepilot/190060441555/bts-london-photo-spots). Some of these are no longer available, but it can be a fun afternoon! 

Take photobooth pics! [Life4Cuts](https://www.instagram.com/life4cuts.uk/?hl=en-gb) is a Korean photobooth – [Namjoon recently went to the one in K-Playground, just off Piccadilly Circus](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLpBRrzMtou/). 

There is also [Cheez](https://www.cheeez.co.uk/), which is a bit of a different vibe 

[The Korean Cultural Centre](https://kccuk.org.uk/en/) has a number of exhibitions and events, plus a library. All free to visit, just walk in and then staff will be very helpful! 

[Horizon 22](https://horizon22.co.uk/) – London's highest viewing platform (250m up). It's also free! You have to pre-book, but they offer walk-ins on the day (just keep in mind that it's the summer holidays). 

As free alternatives, there are also [The Lookout](https://www.8bishopsgate.com/lookout) and [Sky Garden](https://skygarden.london/) (which is an actual garden). 

Museums are mostly free – so take your pic from the [National Gallery](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/) (you cannot bring ANY liquids into this one – this might have changed, but good to keep in mind), the [National Portrait Gallery](https://www.npg.org.uk/), [the V&A.](https://www.vam.ac.uk/) 

[Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern) – Namjoon has been a few times. If you head up to the viewing platform, [you can recreate this photo](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f00806ca076658c0d3127ca1943711d6/9787091d7ca61509-39/s1280x1920/7f29a391671931815ba68f742f8106265566d208.pnj)! 

Hayward Gallery – remember Namjoon's 'Thinker' notebook? He got it at the [Yoshitomo Nara](https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/yoshitomo-nara/) exhibition that is currently running 

[The Wellcome Collection](https://wellcomecollection.org/) is a museum about medicine, health & art – really recommended, their exhibitions are fascinating. 

[Somerset House](https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/) is another firm favourite – a gallery with changing exhibitions, some of them pay what you can. 

Take a walk along the South Bank, from the London Eye to Tower Bridge. If you'd like to see Tower Bridge open, [you can check the lift times here](https://www.towerbridge.org.uk/lift-times) – on Wednesday they clash with Jin's concert, but Monday (and very late on Thursday) also has openings! 

[The Royal Opera House](https://www.rbo.org.uk/) – you won't be able to look inside the auditorium without a tour, but the Paul Hamlyn Hall alone is worth the visit. If you're interested in the behind the scenes, I can recommend the backstage tours – there is no ballet or opera happening at the moment, so you probably won't see any rehearsals, but that also means they have a special summer tour which is longer and takes you into areas you cannot see when the ballet and opera companies are working! 

If you would like to see some theatre while you're here, check out the TodayTix app or [TKTS](https://officiallondontheatre.com/tkts/) for offers. 

High-end department stores can be worth a visit even without buying anything – Harrods is the most famous, but I'd also recommend [Liberty](https://www.libertylondon.com/) and [Fortnum & Mason](https://www.fortnumandmason.com/). They all have very different fancy vibes and, to be honest, VERY good toilet facilities. 

# ...and further out 

[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park](https://www.queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk/) – pretty much what it says on the tin. It's a beautiful park and a nice spot to relax; it's also in Straford, next to a big shopping centre and close to the Jubilee Line. There's also a museum there – the V&A storehouse – that's incredibly worth the visit. 

[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir](https://londonmandir.baps.org/visit-us/) – Britain's / Europe's first traditional, authentic Hindu temple. It's such a beautiful place and you're usually allowed to quietly roam on your own, although they do offer free guided tours. (Keep in mind there's a dress code and you'll need to take off your shoes to access some parts!)

**Did you know London has a Koreatown? It's in New Malden!** It's a 20-minute train ride from Waterloo Station; tickets will usually cost between £5 and £12. You NEED a paper ticket, which you can buy at the station; your Oyster card / bank card will not be valid for this trip. 

# Shopping 

This one's entirely expected: you'll find all major chains in London, both on Oxford Street, around Covent Garden and more. 

Head to Camden or Shoreditch for some more alternative vibes, but bear in mind that both are also tourist destinations, so there's a bit of everything. (I still think they're worth a visit, even if I don't like Camden at ALL.) 

For **BTS / K-Pop merch**, head to [Sokollab ](https://sokollab.co.uk/)or [K-Playground](https://www.instagram.com/kplayground.ldn). You can also find albums at HMV on Oxford Street (closest station: Bond Street) or Fopp in Covent Garden (closest station: Leicester Square). You can also find albums in Oseyo supermarkets, but these tend to be only the latest releases. 

For **K-Beauty**, you have [Pureseoul](https://pureseoul.co.uk/), [Moida](https://moida.co.uk/) and [Glam Touch](http://glamtouch.co.uk/), all of which have at least two branches. There is also a store in Chinatown called [P2Bus](https://www.p2bus.com/) which stocks Korean brands alongside Chinese and Japanese cosmetics (Flower Knows!), including some things you won't find at any of the other stores. (They don't accept every foreign card, but I'll try to find out if they accept cash.) 

[Artbox](https://www.artbox.co.uk/) in Covent Garden has a lot of cute stuff – mainly Sanrio, although they also stock Artbox (the Korean brand) AND have a large BT21 section, and even more in the back. You can check their website, and if you know you want something specific, you can usually email them and ask them to reserve one in Covent Garden for you to pick up. ^(They do have the 'Costume Closet' plush costumes that fit your ARMY bomb, for example...)

If you're into dancewear, head to [Bloch](https://uk.blochworld.com/) or [Capezio](https://capezio.uk/) (or Freed, although they have less choice).

# Toilets, Toilets Everywhere 

I don't know about you, but when I go to a city I'm not used to, I'm always a bit worried about public toilets and whether I'll find any. 

You can download an app called **Toilets4London**, which will show you bathrooms near you, with opening hours and sometimes directions where to go (some even have ratings). Aside from shopping centres – including smaller ones like One New Change – MOST big stores (Marks & Spencer, Foyles, Waterstones...) will have bathrooms, same as museums (bear in mind that you sometimes need to queue for these). 

You can also walk into a lot of public buildings – the Royal Opera House, the National Theatre, and the Southbank Centre, for example – with no need to attend an event, and Transport for London [has a colour-coded map to show which stations have toilets, and whether they're inside our outside the ticket gateline](https://content.tfl.gov.uk/toilets-map.pdf).

Bathrooms in train stations are free, but some might be locked in the evening.  

And if everything else fails, hold your head high, walk into a hotel as if you belong there, and look (or ask) for the bathroom. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This is only a tiny, tiny part of things to do, see, eat in London. Please feel free to post your recommendations, and I'll add them into the post – and if you're coming from outside London, I hope you have the most wonderful time!

I'm a coffee-fuelled FFXIV player, anime fan, and someone who lights up at soft aesthetics and shared creativity.

I’m emotionally grounded, introverted, and always seeking meaningful connection — whether that’s a one-on-one gaming session, or just exchanging thoughts on characters and stories that resonate deeply. I’d love to meet someone who shares that energy: calm, emotionally present, and open to a gentle, slow-growing connection that might blossom into something romantic.

# Here's some interests that I have:

* RPGs like FFXIV, Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail (more for the story than the grind)
* Anime (Re:Zero, Frieren, Shield Hero, fantasy, or character-driven series)
* Co-op games, soft aesthetics, creative worldbuilding, or storytelling
* Casual Magic the Gathering player (even though my decks seem to be too strong for their own good)
* Voice chats once or twice a week to talk, play, or just vibe quietly

Maybe if we vibe well enough, we could meet in-person at a con!

I’m especially drawn to people who are emotionally available, kind, sincere, and a little whimsical. Bonus points if you love thoughtful characters, quiet moments, and the idea of building something real over time.

No pressure, no drama — just genuine curiosity and emotional warmth. If this resonates with you, feel free to reach out with a little about you. I’d love to hear what makes you light up.",1,1752694625.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I told them I’d like to put together an easy tea/coffee/cocktails bar that everyone can use. 

I ordered Hedessent flavour drops - I was intrigued and they seemed like they would be suitable for hot drinks like coffee and tea as well as for cocktails. The flavours I have are elderflower, fresh fig, passion fruit, marshmallow, bergamot, and Tahitian bean. 

From what I gather, these flavour drops can be incorporated directly into a drink or used to make a flavoured simply syrup that is then used for a drink. 

I would love ideas for what I should make! I’d love to batch a cocktail (ideally with gin, tequila, or mezcal as a base) and have something to make a quick and easy spritz, using these flavour drops.

Last week, I handled the grocery order myself and asked my partner what he needed. He said cereal and tea, and when I double-checked again, he confirmed that was everything. But when the groceries arrived, he was upset that I hadn’t included his coffee. Something we usually add to our order, but that he hadn’t mentioned this time. Eventually, he acknowledged that he hadn’t communicated it and admitted it was on him.

This week, I did the grocery order again while he was gaming—he responded when I had questions, and we planned to make tacos. Based on his feedback to include more vegetables in our dinners, I told him I was adding tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, lettuce, so we could have that for tacos. After a 10-hour workday that included commuting, folding laundry, and cooking red rice and taco meat from scratch, he said he was disappointed I hadn’t bought small/larger soft flour tortillas instead of using the regular size corn tortillas from the fridge. He said he wasn't mad. But he wished we were “on the same page,” and said I should’ve known that we’d need a larger base to hold all the ingredients.

I truly appreciate that he's expressing what he wants more clearly, but in both situations, I felt unrecognized for the effort I put in while managing everything on my own. It feels like the expectations keep shifting. Am I failing as a partner? (We take turns doing groceries, but I am with him when he does it while he games when I do it)

1. If after graduation I don't get a job, will the visa that I will get (i think 2 years) to find a job, count towards citizenship?
2. Is the extended visa available only for those taking Masters or language course is also eligible for this?

Picture this: You're doing great on your Zepbound journey. You're feeling fuller, maybe noticing some positive changes on the scale. But then, a subtle headache creeps in, or you feel a bit more tired than usual. You might even notice things are a little- well, *stuck* in the digestive department. You might be wondering, ""What's going on?""

Often, the answer is simpler than you think: **hydration**. We all know drinking water is important for general health. But here's the thing- when you're taking Zepbound, staying properly hydrated isn't just a good idea, it's actually **extra important**. It's a key player in helping you feel your best and get the most out of your medication.

In this post, we're going to dive into why Zepbound makes hydration even more critical, how to spot the sneaky signs that you're not drinking enough, and most importantly, some super practical tips to keep your water bottle your best friend.

**Why Zepbound Makes Hydration Even More Critical**

You see, Zepbound works by slowing down gastric emptying. This means food stays in your stomach longer, helping you feel full and satisfied. That's a fantastic mechanism for weight management, right? But it also means your body's usual rhythm for processing things changes a bit. And that's where hydration steps in as a true hero.

**Managing Common Side Effects**

One of the biggest reasons to prioritize hydration on Zepbound is to help manage some of the common side effects. Many people experience things like:

* **Nausea:** Dehydration can definitely make you feel queasy. Staying hydrated can help settle your stomach.
* **Constipation:** This is a big one. Because food moves more slowly through your digestive system, and your appetite might be reduced, you might not be getting as much fiber or fluid as before. Water is essential for keeping things moving smoothly.
* **Fatigue or Headaches:** These are classic signs of mild dehydration. You might attribute them to Zepbound itself, but often, a big glass of water is all you need to perk up.

**Supporting Metabolism and Overall Well-being**

Your body relies on water for practically every function. When you're losing weight, your metabolism is working hard. Water plays a vital role in:

* **Fat metabolism:** Water is needed for the process of burning fat for energy.
* **Nutrient transport:** It helps carry essential nutrients to your cells and waste products away.
* **Maintaining energy levels:** When you're dehydrated, your blood volume can drop, making your heart work harder and leading to fatigue.

So, staying well-hydrated isn't just about avoiding discomfort; it's about **optimizing your body's performance** as you work towards your goals.

**How to Spot Dehydration's Sneaky Signs**

Sometimes, we think we're hydrated because we're not actively *thirsty*. But thirst is actually one of the later signs of dehydration. Your body is pretty good at adapting, which can sometimes mask the early signals.

**Beyond Just Thirst**

Here are some signs that you might not be drinking enough, even if you don't feel parched:

* **Dark urine:** This is probably the easiest and most reliable indicator. Your urine should be pale yellow- like lemonade, not apple juice.
* **Fatigue or low energy:** Feeling sluggish, even after a good night's sleep? Check your water intake.
* **Headaches:** Often described as a dull ache.
* **Dry mouth or chapped lips:** A pretty obvious one, but sometimes overlooked.
* **Dizziness or lightheadedness:** Especially when standing up quickly.
* **Muscle cramps:** Electrolyte imbalances can contribute to this, and hydration helps maintain that balance.
* **Reduced urination frequency:** If you're not making trips to the bathroom often enough, it's a sign.

It's important to listen to your body's subtle cues. They're trying to tell you something!

**Your Hydration Playbook: Practical Tips for Zepbound Users**

Alright, so we know *why* hydration is crucial. Now, let's talk about the *how*. It can feel like a lot of water to drink, especially when your appetite is suppressed. But I've found that with a few simple strategies, it becomes second nature.

**Make it a Habit**

Consistency is key here. It's easier to sip throughout the day than to chug a bunch of water all at once.

* **Start your day with water:** Before coffee, before breakfast- have a big glass of water first thing. It kickstarts your system.
* **Carry a reusable water bottle:** This is probably the most effective tip. Seeing it reminds you to drink. Choose one you love!
* **Set reminders:** Use your phone, a smart watch, or even a simple alarm to remind yourself to take a few sips every hour.
* **Pair it with activities:** Drink a glass of water before every meal, after every bathroom break, or when you sit down at your desk.

**Flavor It Up (Naturally!)**

Plain water isn't everyone's favorite, and that's okay! You don't have to force yourself to drink something you dislike.

* **Infused water:** Add slices of cucumber, lemon, lime, orange, berries, or mint leaves to your water. It adds a refreshing flavor without sugar or artificial sweeteners.
* **Herbal teas:** Unsweetened herbal teas, hot or iced, count towards your fluid intake. Peppermint or ginger tea can also help with nausea.
* **Sparkling water with fruit:** A great alternative if you like a bit of fizz. Just be mindful of added sugars in some flavored sparkling waters.

**Smart Sips Throughout the Day**

Because Zepbound can make you feel full faster, sometimes drinking large amounts of liquid with meals can feel uncomfortable.

* **Sip between meals:** Focus on hydrating throughout the day, especially in between your main eating times.
* **Don't force it:** If you feel overly full, take a break and come back to it. Small, frequent sips are better than trying to chug.
* **Consider electrolyte drinks (carefully):** If you're very active, or experiencing significant fluid loss, a sugar-free electrolyte drink might be helpful. But always check with your doctor first, as some can be high in sodium or sugar.

**Listen to Your Body**

Ultimately, you are the expert on your own body. Pay attention to how you feel. Are you feeling sluggish? Is your urine dark? These are your body's signals. Adjust your fluid intake accordingly. Remember, the goal isn't just to hit a number of ounces- it's to feel good and support your body's incredible work.

**Final Thoughts**

Staying hydrated on Zepbound is more than just a good habit- it's a **powerful tool** in your wellness toolkit. It helps mitigate common side effects, keeps your body's systems running smoothly, and supports your overall energy and progress. So, grab that water bottle, infuse it with your favorite fruit, and make those sips count. Your body will thank you!",1,1752694236.0,ZepboundGuide,0,1.0,False

I’m spilling my heart out ‘cause I’m super depressed and just need some peace. I want to hear from people on my side, his side, anyone with thoughts. So, here’s my story…
I’m a woman in my mid-20s. Met this guy on TikTok, and we talked for a whole year. Dude had red flags everywhere tons of girls in his followers, and I was like, “Nah, this guy’s trouble, I can’t be with someone like him.” But he started pulling back, ignoring me little by little. I caught myself, blocked him everywhere, and thought I was done. Surprise, though I didn’t realize how attached I was. Cried my soul out for two weeks straight. Couldn’t hold it in, so I hit him up again. And guess what? He acted like nothing happened no mention of the blocks, just talked like it was all good.
Things got deeper. He started showing more interest, sending gifts, even a 15-minute handwritten paragraph apologizing, swearing he wasn’t manipulating me. I was confused why’s he spending money now after a year of nothing? Thought maybe he meant it, but I’m still not sure. Things got serious, and we went on our first date. My first ever. I was shy, cute, feeling flawless that morning. He took me to cool spots, we ate, talked about life (mostly him talking, me listening). He didn’t try anything physical, just super gentlemanly opened doors, sliced my food, got me everything before I asked. I was like, “Wow, I need to marry this guy.” Masculine, mature, gentle perfect first impression.
After that, I told him I had feelings, said I loved him. He said it back, and I was over the moon, thinking he was finally giving me the same love. He started ordering food for me, taking care of me like crazy. Second date, we held hands in the car felt safe, loved, butterflies everywhere with his music and those sweet lyrics. Third date, we started kissing, cuddling. I was so into him his hugs, his lap, everything. I was falling hard.
But then, I noticed his following list didn’t change. Not one girl gone, even after I brought it up without being judgy (didn’t wanna seem toxic). He swore he only cared about me, promised to marry me when he’s financially stable, said he’d unfollow them. I said okay, but plot twist the list stayed the same. Still, when I was with him, he treated me like a queen. I cried in his arms, he saw the real me, and I knew he loved me saw it in his eyes, his touch, the way he spent money. Dude got me 35 red roses for Valentine’s with cards, chocolate, coffee, Sephora makeup for my birthday. We hit every spot in the city, even took a speedboat. I was like, “It’s him or nobody.”
But at home? He’d ignore me for hours, even though I saw his Snapchat score climbing. Follows new girls daily. I was there when he was sick, jobless, gave him all my love, kisses. Why’s he still doing this? He told his mom and sister about me, knows where my dad works, knows every broken piece of my heart. He un-traumatized me, then re-traumatized me.
The worst part? He started ignoring my texts for no reason. I’d wait for his call, and he’d just… not. I was losing my mind. I know he’s avoidant, and I’m super attached need that 24/7 consistency. We were together five months, full of love and gentleness. Last thing he said was, “I love you, whether you accept it or not.” I just wanted his attention. What happened? I tried shouting at him on every social media nothing. He didn’t give a single crap. I cried, threw up daily, ‘cause I loved him for real. How’s someone so harsh after hugging and kissing me days before? His smell, our deep talks, the places we went .. it’s stuck in my head.
I sent a million messages, blocked him everywhere (even found accounts I didn’t know about). Felt like a fool. Was he just a master manipulator? First two days, I cried. Then I calmed down, realized he’s not husband or father material just nothing. But two weeks later, I’m crashing again, crying every few minutes. I crave the love he gave, but I don’t want a cheater who follows girls and doesn’t even say sorry when I remove him on Snap. Like, what’s wrong with you? How’d your mama raise you? Mommy issues, daddy issues, what? Was it so hard to say, “I don’t love you anymore” on our last date? Or did you lie to my face for six months? I just need a real convo to feel like I meant something. How’s his heart so cold? Cheating should be illegal I’d sue him. Now I’m in therapy, drowning in pain, stuck with memories. I deleted our pics but kept our chats. Every time I see his face, I’m like, “Why’d you pick other girls over me? Was it that easy to erase me?”
If you’re avoidant, why do this? How do you treat someone you loved like garbage? Stand up and tell me what I’m missing. How do I handle this heartbreak?

1m1lwen,https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1m1lwen/first_time_in_store_since_halloween_releaseda/,First time in store since Halloween released...a couple thoughts and a couple questions....,"Skip below for the 2 I actually bought and the questions...

First, Summerween...

* Vampire Blood and Ghould Friend...didn't smell since I haven't finished previous bottles ... I will likely pick up a Ghoul Friend soap at some point since I do really like it in soap
* Wicked Vanilla Woods...I did pick up the FFM today (this was online only last year, right?). It doesn't beat out Vanilla Romance in my book but it does seem like a nice alternative.
* I Scream Float...undecided on this. Definitely opens with a strong fizzy note which also fades out fairly quickly...or seemed to. I will give this another chance next time I am in store but skipped today.

Second, the Vanillas...

* Vanilla Romance...I adore. Love. Didn't pick up any new pieces today because I don't need. This is a favorite. One of the best scents they have done in recent years imo.
* Vanilla Ease...not for me. Lavender. I like some lavender candles like Pink Lavender & Espresso and Lavender Marshmallow. But not body care usually.
* Vanilla Cafe...thought I would like this one but...it was not hitting for me today. I felt at times like it was too sweet? Like there was a caramel note in it that isn't listed? I don't know. I will try it again at some point in store but today it was not a win for me.

Third, Aromatherapy/Wellness

* Milk: skipped since I already have it from last release
* Honeycomb: only sprayed on a paper test strip. wasn't feeling it.
* Rich Espresso: waffled on this mist in store. almost bought it. but in the end skipped it. also tried the lotion on my hands and didn't like the lotion at all. liked the mist more but I'm sure my dislike of the lotion played into my waffling. I think if I try it again I will put down a sweet lotion of some sort first as a base and then try Espresso mist over it. It also didn't hit me as being as much of a strong ""coffee"" flavor as I anticipated based on other comments. It is less sweet and more straightforward than Vanilla Cafe, but I don't find it overwhelmingly strong.

Fourth, Traditional Fall

* Champagne Apple & Honey...I do enjoy this scent a lot, but have a set I haven't finished. I am assuming no real changes to it.
* Sweater Weather: not for me
* Glazed Pumpkin: not sure about this one. when I first sprayed it I got hit with the sweet caramel tones which turned me off so I immediately was like ""nope."" But on the way home and such, an hour...hour and a half later, I keep smelling a scent I like and I think it might be Glazed Pumpkin. I'm going to have to try it again at some point.
* Body Loft: ffm was in store even though it's not showing on the website for me. definitely on the skin scent and subtle side. I think the weather today (upper 80's to 90) played into why I liked this more today than other scents. 

**To sum up, the only 2 I bought (using rewards) were Body Loft and Wicked Vanilla Woods.**

*The ones I will smell again next time I visit the store are*: Glazed Pumpkin, Rich Espresso, Vanilla Cafe, and I Scream Float.

Now the **questions**...

* for those of you who have tried *Glazed Pumpkin*, did you also notice a strong caramel sweet opening and then did it mellow out?
* for those of you who tried *I Scream Float*, did you also notice the ""fizzy"" note disappearing fast too? did you really pick up much of a lingering scent at all after like 20-30 minutes?
* Finally, *Body Loft*...it is pleasant and surprisingly has not completely disappeared (been 2 hours or so)...but, thoughts? What do we think it is most similar to?",4,1752693726.0,bathandbodyworks,2,1.0,False

1m1lozk,https://www.reddit.com/r/summariseme/comments/1m1lozk/20250716_public_health_now_protecting_communities/,(2025-07-16) Public Health Now Protecting Communities Today,"## Public Health Briefing: Concerns Rise Over Food Safety and Unsubstantiated Medical Practices on July 16, 2025

Public health concerns are brewing in Pune and online, as evidenced by developments on July 16, 2025. The day's news highlights emerging challenges related to food safety regulations and the proliferation of potentially dangerous medical practices promoted through online platforms. Two key areas demand immediate attention: a potential erosion of food transparency in Pune's sweet shops and a cautionary tale regarding the dangers of embracing unverified medical procedures promoted online.

**Food Safety Concerns in Pune: A Retreat from Transparency?**

A significant development impacting public health revolves around the practices of sweet shops in Pune. Following a shift in regulatory guidelines, many shops have ceased displaying crucial information about their products, raising serious health and consumer safety concerns. This situation stems from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)'s decision in November 2023 to make date labeling voluntary for loose sweets. This reversed a 2020 mandate that mandated the inclusion of essential details such as manufacturing date, best-before date, and pricing on sweets.

The implications of this shift are significant. Consumers are now left in the dark, unable to adequately assess the freshness and quality of the sweets they purchase. Without this information, consumers are unable to make informed decisions about their health. This lack of transparency not only undermines consumer rights but also poses potential health risks. The absence of expiry dates makes it difficult to differentiate between fresh and potentially stale products, increasing the likelihood of consumers consuming food that may have degraded or even become contaminated.

This concern is further amplified by a recent incident involving the temporary suspension of the license of Good Luck Cafe, a well-known establishment in Pune. The suspension, which took place last Sunday, was due to hygiene issues following the discovery of a glass piece in a ""bun maska."" This incident underscores the need for stringent hygiene standards, proper food handling practices, and comprehensive food safety regulations. The case also suggests that, when not coupled with a mandatory labeling scheme, voluntary compliance of food safety can lead to serious health risks.

The situation in Pune highlights the vital role of regulation in protecting consumer health. The voluntary approach to date labeling, while potentially intended to reduce the burden on businesses, may inadvertently jeopardize public health. The absence of readily available information on product freshness creates an environment where consumers are vulnerable to potentially unsafe products. This case underscores the need for the FSSAI to reassess the effectiveness of the current voluntary approach.

**The Perils of Internet-Driven Healthcare: The Coffee Enema Controversy**

Beyond the local concerns of food safety, another pressing public health issue emanates from the digital sphere: the spread of unsubstantiated medical practices and the potential dangers of blindly embracing these trends. The internet, while offering unprecedented access to information, is also a breeding ground for misinformation and pseudoscience.

A particular trend gaining traction, and raising substantial alarm from medical professionals, is the practice of coffee enemas. Advocates of this unconventional method promote it as a ‘natural detox’ and a cure-all for a range of ailments, including headaches and even cancer. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Furthermore, this practice carries a significant risk of adverse health consequences.

Medical experts are strongly advising against this practice. One example of this pushback comes from digital creator Dr. Idrees Mughal, who, in an Instagram reel, explicitly warned against the practice. His message, ""Guys please don’t stick coffee directly into your a*se,"" captures the gravity of the situation, and the unproven and potentially harmful nature of the practice.

The case of coffee enemas underscores the necessity of critical evaluation and discernment when consuming medical information online. The internet is saturated with information, much of which is not vetted by medical professionals. Individuals seeking health advice must be cautious and seek credible sources. The coffee enema trend highlights how easily misinformation can spread and the dangers of relying on unverified claims, especially those that promote self-treatment without professional medical consultation.

The popularity of such practices illustrates a worrying trend of people seeking “alternative remedies” instead of consulting qualified health practitioners. The reliance on unscientific methods often stems from a lack of trust in mainstream medicine or a desire for quick fixes. However, the potential health consequences of these practices are significant.

**Conclusion: A Call for Vigilance and Informed Action**

The public health developments on July 16, 2025, present a multifaceted challenge. On one hand, the changes in food labeling regulations in Pune pose a risk to consumer health due to reduced transparency. On the other, the rise of potentially harmful medical practices like coffee enemas online demands immediate attention.

To safeguard public health, several actions are critical. In Pune, regulators should reassess the efficacy of the voluntary approach to date labeling, considering its potential impact on food safety. Increased surveillance of sweet shops, combined with public awareness campaigns, can also help to mitigate the risks.

Concerning the online spread of misinformation, there is a need for educational initiatives to promote media literacy and critical thinking skills. Health authorities should actively combat the spread of unverified medical claims by debunking them and educating the public. Moreover, the public must be encouraged to consult with qualified medical professionals for health advice and treatment.

In conclusion, the events of this day offer valuable lessons. They reinforce the need for vigilance in food safety practices and responsible consumption of online health information. By embracing informed decision-making, critical thinking, and consulting with qualified healthcare professionals, the public can protect themselves from the inherent risks in both the food they consume and the information they encounter online.

“Unfortunately son, you’ll never walk again.”

I’ll never forget those words. My mom cried, my dad left with the doctor. When I got in my buddy’s car, we thought we were bulletproof. Maybe we were, but we weren’t telephone pole proof. The next 6 months were a blur of physical therapy and prayer. I didn’t even know we belonged to a church, all of a sudden we’re in the front row and people are walking around my new chair to take communion. It all felt so forced. Maybe that’s why we stopped going as soon as the PT confirmed what the doctor had cursed me with. 

It’s surprisingly easy to learn how to be differently abled. The looks and fake pity wore off after the first week. The handicap placard came in the mail the same day as the hospital bill. By the time I got to college, I was used to asking for accommodations. As I rolled across the stage, I could see a future of elevators and aisle seats sprawled out before me. I placed the framed degree on my wall as the mail fell through the door. On top was a non-descript letter with no return address that caught my attention. 

YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED

The big bold letters on the front signed this letter's ticket to the junk pile. After sorting everything, I went back to my day. Everytime I passed my credenza though, that letter caught my eye. I knew it was just a credit card scam or a personal loan, but there was something about it. Eventually I gave in and took it to my office. Picking up my letter opener I was weirdly anxious. This was a piece of mail. What did I even have to be anxious about? News headlines popped in my head: “Local idiot falls victim to mail bomb,” “The Unibomber strikes from the grave,” “Are the handicapped more susceptible to anthrax: results may shock you.”
Inside the envelope wasn’t nearly that exciting. 

It contained a piece of paper with an address and a phone number. The address was some field in the middle of nowhere Tennessee and the phone number went to an automated line. A very chipper, albeit obviously recorded, voice picked up with pretty standard fare. “Congratulations. You have been selected as a candidate for our brand new program.” Obviously a scam. “Please prepare to record the details of our offer!”

Then the voice changed. Now it’s a very robotic AI type. The tone didn’t’t matter. The voice could’ve been anything when it said my name. Then the recording came back to ask me to confirm. When I did, the robot returned. 
“You are now suffering from paralysis. Would you like to regain your life?”

I didn’t know what to say. What was this? It had to be some kind of joke. After a moment with no response, it came back, “Joseph, do you want your legs back? Yes or no?”

I responded with a half hearted, shaky yes and the only response I got was “two days.” Then the line went silent. Thoughts escaped me. I considered calling my mom, but she’d never believe me. My dad would get confused and accuse me of falling for a scam. All that I had was to wait and see what happened to me. 

Two days later, I woke up just as I had for years. Pulled my legs out of bed. Moved into my chair. Got ready for the day. Went into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. Made my way to the office and saw another envelope on the floor. This one was blank. Same size, same shape, same everything minus the writing. I scooped it up and noticed some weight. When I got it open, there was a plane ticket with my name on it. No other information. No airline, destination, departure gate, nothing. There was my name, today’s date, and a weird seal that I’ve never seen. To put it into words, an octopus with wings. Something about it felt sinister, but I threw the papers in the trash.

I was google searching scams involving travel, medical issues, weird marine-biologists. Really anything that could help me figure it out. This was interrupted by a car horn. I made my way to the door and outside stood a blacked-out Cadillac. I assumed it must be my neighbor’s until someone got out and started walking to my door. I backed away in time for the door to open and the man made eye contact with me. 

“Mr. Tuttle?” I sat in silence. “I will be your escort for the duration of your travel. Please follow me.” And he walked out just as swiftly as he came in. I don’t know why, but I followed him. He opened the back door and gave me a hand getting settled. He folded my chair and placed it in the back. I closed my door and away we went. 

We drove for what felt like hours. The entire time, I couldn’t get stories of abductions and the countless missing posters I had seen pasted all over town out of my head. Was I being abducted? Does this count as an abduction? I did go willingly. This man was being nothing but cordial so far. Aren’t kidnappers supposed to be gruff and rude? The silence was broken as we slowed for a turn. 

“Do you have your ticket?” 

“I’m sorry, what?”

“The ticket you received. Did you bring it?”

“No, I think it’s on my desk.”

“No worries. We’ll get you one sorted.” Then he tossed my passport into the seat beside me. I was working up the courage to ask who he was or how he got it when we came to a stop. 

I’m by no means an aviation expert, but I did go through a phase as a kid. When I say this was the most beautiful, wellkept Cessna Citation Jet I’d ever seen, I mean it. Granted, I didn’t have a ton of experience in private jets. But none of that mattered. The driver opened my door and I was met with a flight attendant type that had my chair ready to go and a ramp that was almost certainly special made. I rolled right up into the plane and made myself comfortable. She came over and gave me a brief safety run down and asked if I was comfortable. 

“Mr. Straker informed us that you would require certain accommodations and we are here to provide. Just say the word.”
She then placed a drink in front of me and disappeared to the rear. I hesitantly took a sip and found the drink to be quite pleasant. Somehow they had perfectly captured the taste of peanuts in a coke and poured it into my glass. After that sip didn’t make my mouth tingly or make me throw up, I quite enjoyed it. As we escaped the ground, I felt a heaviness come over my body. 

When I woke up, the flight attendant was taking my trash as we prepared to descend. I asked her where we were but she just smiled and walked away. The plane lands, I make my way off and I’m greeted by my driver. Same song and dance, same Cadillac. If not for the extreme humidity change, you could convince me we never left. He pulled the car to a stop in front of an office building. That’s what I’d call it if it was anywhere else. In comparison to the huts and dilapidated buildings surrounding it, the building loomed with a dark aura. The beating sun was blotted out by its massive footprint and then reflecting off its millions of windows. The locals didn’t seem to notice. Or if they did, they didn’t point it out to me. If I was in a monster movie, lightning would be striking the peak with crows circling about. 

Inside was sterile. Glistening white marble accentuated by an onyx black desk with a rather attractive woman sitting behind it. When the door shut behind us, she looked up from her computer and came running to greet us. 

“Oh my god! It’s so nice to meet you! I’m Holly. Victor has told us so much about you. Can I get you a water?”

I was taken aback. No one yet had been this bubbly. Everyone was nice, but reserved. Holly was your stereotypical valley girl who acted like she had met a puppy. I’d be lying if I said the female attention wasn’t nice. She guided me to a seating area and for the first time there wasn’t anything special. I parked my chair next to the empty ones and waited. 

After a few minutes, I heard the comically loud creak of a door down the hallway followed by a slam that shook the empty room. As heels struck the polished floors, my anxiety returned at not knowing who I’d be meeting. The steps stopped at a door, opened it and shared some words and then another set of feet joined. This happened a couple of times until an entourage entered my view. The group of generic office types stopped, almost in sync, and parted to let the organizer through. Out of this mob of middle managers came a man that could’ve graced Forbes circa 1985. The sharp collar, gelled hair, and suspenders made this man look like he had been transported through time to be here with me today. The illusion was broken when he removed an iPhone from his pocket and silenced the ringer. 

“Ah, Mr. Tuttle. It is so nice to finally meet.”
His voice filled me with a sense of despair that was only slightly diminished by his salesman’s charisma. 

“I am Mr. Straker, but as I’m sure Holly informed you, everyone calls me Victor.”
He extended his hand for a shake and I met with hesitation. 

“We are so glad to finally have you here with us at our facility. Since our inception, we have dreamed of a day to improve someone in your situation.”

His gesture melted my walls of uncertainty, and he noticed. “Now that you’re here, let’s get you settled. Afterwards we can get you on a tour.”
I am led by my escort to the elevator. He presses the top button and we ascend. I can’t help but notice that every button except the top and lobby are locked behind a card scanner. As we reach the floor, the elevator dings and we enter into a massive room. If this were the Hilton, I’d call it the presidential suite. Except everything was at eye level. Lowered counter tops, mirrors touching the ground, even the doorknobs were lower. I went into one of the bedrooms and it even had larger spaces beside the bed for my chair. It’s almost as if this room was made for me. I was pulled out of my awe by the escort saying something. I asked him to repeat and, in a much sterner tone, he sighed, “Dinner at 6. Get ready for your tour.” And shut the door. Get ready? I hadn’t even had the chance to pack bags. I went into the bedroom and found the drawers and closet stuffed with track suits my exact measurements. There must have been two dozen. If not for everything else, I might’ve found this weird. I must admit, I was pretty hungry. I got changed into the branded suit and made my way to the elevator. The escort was there waiting for me and scanned his card to open the door as I approached. We made our way back down but not to the lobby. I didn’t catch what number he pushed but the lights indicated that we were dropping well below that. I hadn’t even noticed those buttons earlier. 

On the outside of the sliding doors was Victor. He had changed into formal garden wear and presented a much more laid back appearance. Once again I was met with a handshake and away he walked down the hallway. Instinctually I followed. As we rounded the corner to a locked door, he finally spoke. 

“Here at Straker Industries, we are the leading innovators in all things improvement. As a matter of fact, that’s where my grandfather came up with our slogan ‘We fix what he overlooked.’ Grandfather was a religious man, but he never felt that his image was the peak. So he opened our first facility.” He outstretched his hands and the doors opened for him. We stepped over the threshold and a wave of calm came over me. I expected a corporate hellscape or a doctor’s waiting room. Instead I found a museum. As Victor and I walked he recounted years of history. There was a picture of his relative with Henry Ford, a group of people outside of Tut’s Tomb, the group picture of Apollo 11, the list goes on. I couldn’t help but notice a large chunk of time missing. I had to stop him. “How did you guys make it through the Depression?”

“We simply explored some foreign endeavors that paid out when they needed to.” This was technically an answer, but not quite satisfactory. I decided to let sleeping dogs lie and we continued the tour. I had zoned off until we reached the next door. He paused and reached for the handles. “This here, is what we’re really proud of” was all he said before throwing the doors open. 

When you hear stories of Neverland ranch or Suddam’s palace, the first thing people talk about are the zoos. I have heard so many stories about the tigers and the monkeys and whatever else they could get their hands on. Those did not prepare me for what was behind that hatch. The first window we passed was not dissimilar to a primate cage at the zoo. These apes could not be happy. The constant yelling and screaming was deafening. Victor yelled something over the noise but I couldn’t break my attention away from the smallest one. 

Standing about 3.5 feet tall, he was hunched over a children’s toy. As the only one not screaming, I shared his focus with the task at hand. As he sorted small blocks into the proper holes, I was amazed. This level of intellectualism is what I was told separated us from the monkeys. He must have noticed I was looking. As his eyes met mine, I was filled with sadness. The eyes looked human. I could tell he was scared. He wanted out, to see the world. Only then did I notice the patches of hair. All over the small frame, there were patches of black wiry hair. Not like it had lost hair, but like it had grown new. Then I noticed the shape of the face. It wasn’t elongated, more circular. Then I saw the limbs. As I started to put together what I had seen, Mr. Straker re-entered my consciousness. “Alopecia. Doesn’t matter how many of them we get, they can’t grow hair right.” Away we walked. Nothing more. As we entered the next set of doors, the screams subsided, except one. If you’d told me there was a child screaming for its mother, you would’ve described the sound that stood my hair on edge. 

The trap between doors came with a rush of air and an unlocking. This time there was no enclosure. The room was empty except for a figure in the corner. Victor's voice got low and he started to creep. “This next specimen is one that we worked years on. After many attempts, this one seems to have worked.” Before I had time to process what he had said, the figure's head snaps around and I hear the rattle of an iron chain as it stands up to meet our gaze. As the creature fully unfolded, I felt a deep resentment for the curse of creation. Its bare appearance left no gory detail to the imagination. From the shadow, I witnessed the silhouette of two legs, then three, then four. None the same size as the other. Then the torso, wider than any man, gave way to a matching number of arms. At the apex of this mass of natural crime was a keg of what I could only call a head. The thing stumbled into the light and it somehow got worse. Down the center of this creature was a seam. Something, or someone, fused these beings. These people. The eyes shot a look at mine of pain and suffering. With labored breathing and out of sync blinking, the being attempted to speak. The garbled mess of spit and grunts was interrupted by Mr. Straker cutting in with something about organ health and donation. I focused in on the being and reached out to touch it. As I did, the escort grabbed my chair. I hadn’t even realized he was there. I was wheeled out of the room, but I could swear it worked out a “save” between groans and sputters. Those eyes. I’ll never forget those eyes. 

As the door shut behind me, Straker wiped his hands with a handkerchief and let out a sigh. “Well, wasn’t that something? Now that you have seen our successes, we hope that you can begin to understand the importance of our work and your part to play.”

“I can’t say that I do understand where I fit into all of this.”

“Well.” He seemed flustered. “Nothing we can’t fix with dinner.” He clapped his hands together and took off down the hallway. I followed into a glorious dining room. The art on the wall alone made this a rival to the ballrooms of Versailles. At the center was a rather intimate table with two settings. I had assumed I would be eating with Victor, but at the head of the table was Holly. She had transformed from her valley girl, business casual appearance in the lobby to a woman befitting James Bond. The slit in her dress went almost as high as the top went low. Her yellow bun had become golden locks that danced around her delicate shoulders. The hands that had been clicking away at her computer now had elegantly manicured nails and looked to be unspoiled by the hardships of life. As she stood to greet me, I almost did the same. 

We enjoyed the many spoils that came with endless funds. The steaks, the caviar, everything was perfect. They brought out a tiramisu that rivaled the ambrosia of Olympus. And the wine. From a Riesling that was lost during the Second World War to a Heisdeck Champagne from the Titanic. Everything was perfect. Afterwards, Holly and I spent time chatting about the art and what life was like with Straker. As the night continued, so did the wine. Then brandy. Then more wine. After a couple of hours, I had found a friend in the least likely of places. We head to the elevator, she scans her card, and follows me into the capsule. The door to my room opens, and we stroll into my new abode. She tells me that she’ll meet me in the next room and heads to grab more wine. I move towards the door and that’s as much as I remember. 

The next morning, all of the blood has returned to my head with a vengeance. I’ve had my party nights, but nothing had hit me this hard. The window allows a beam of heat into my world, blistering my sensitive corneas. I make my way to the bathroom and immediately reminded myself of what made me feel this way. After I clean myself up, I go to get dressed in today’s track suit and I find a glass of water, two unassuming pills, and a note. “Thought you might need these. -H.” She really must care. As I approach the elevator, the door opens and I meet the escort again. “Mr. Straker expresses his regret that he could not meet you this morning.” I was in no mood for conversation so I let out a groan and down we go. This time to floor 9. The elevator stops but the doors do not open. Instead the escort stands there with a physical key inserted, staring at a red light. As the light turns green, he twists the key and the room is filled with blinding light. Out of the brightness steps a silhouette with outstretched arms. 

“Welcome. Are you ready?” I rubbed my eyes and Victor came into focus. He took my hand and gave it a vigorous shake. “Are you ready, my boy? This is where we make wishes come true.” He leads me into what I at first thought was a hospital. People standing in groups, wearing scrubs and face shields. Everyone had a table on which they were vehemently focused. The only clue to what was so interesting was the occasional tool request and leaking mystery fluid. As we passed through the decon chamber and I was fitted with my own mask, I got a better look. On every table was a torso. These people looked to be medical students doing a cadaver lab, but they were still bleeding. The back side of the room had a locked door full of muffled noises. I inquired about the source and was brushed off. As we continued moving forward, I was told something about scientific advancement and the study of the human form. My focus was divided between trying to listen to what was being said and that room. One of the larger strangers takes a bag full of the remains of one of the tables and heads towards the door. As he opens it, I catch a glimpse of a man in a coat with a saw and the noise became screams for half a second. Shortly after we exit the room. The escort helps me onto a table of my own and I refuse to lay down. Victor comes around into frame, now wearing his own scrubs, and begins to explain my procedure. 

“What we have found is that the best way to cure bad blood is to replace it. In your case, we believe your legs are full of the stuff.” He pointed to an MRI on the board. “Here and here are your problem areas. As our research has found, the best procedure for someone like you is the full replacement of the host limb…” he continued speaking but I zoned out. In my distracted state, the escort grabbed my forehead and forced me down. I felt the straps close on my head and arms. I began to struggle as much as I could muster as an unknown member walked to my side with a syringe. I tried to scream but the mask over my face tightens. 

“I’m sorry Joseph. This part is the least fortunate. Rest assured, much like work, pain will set you free.” Then I was out. 

In the darkness, I was filled with nightmares. I was in the woods. I was running. Behind me was a pack of dogs. As I ran they continued getting closer. Every step I took, the hunt grew shorter. I could smell their breath and feel the drool dripping off of their jowls. As they pounced on me, I stared into the alpha's eyes. The view was familiar. The wolves did not rip me apart. Instead they chewed. They chewed and chewed as the alpha stared into my eyes. Those eyes. They were filled with so much sorrow. 

I woke up to a new sight. The lights were softer and the nurse was kinder. She offered me a glass of water and helped me sit up to drink it. When I needed the facilities, she was there to help me up. I threw back the blankets and let out a scream. Where my useless noodles of muscle and bone used to be were now two lumps of flesh I didn’t recognize that were pale in color and completed with dirty stitches. The fear that coursed through my blood was quickly rushed away when I noticed the pain. 

My legs burned with the heat of infection, but they hurt. I hadn’t felt my legs hurt in years. My toes moved. The nurse helped me to my feet and I stumbled to the restroom. I walked to the bathroom. He had done it. That mad man had cured my paralysis. If only he’d stopped there. 
The next days were filled with me relearning how to walk. Like a baby I stumbled along hand rails and then toddled my way across the room. Before I knew it, the accident had never happened. As my life force reinvigorated the cold chunks that had been fused at my thigh, I was returning to normal. The nights were filled with tears. Happy at first, and then painful. The doctors said I was building muscle, but something didn’t feel right. Call it intuition, but I would swear my body was rejecting my attempt to defy nature. 

After 3 weeks, I returned to my suite and prepared to leave. Victor met me in my room and seemed to be helping me pack. We talked of plans for the future and what to do with my new gift. I thanked him vigorously, leaving out the growing fear of what was to come. Then I collapsed. My forehead covered in sweat and my vision blurring, the infection had taken over. Mr. Straker ran to my side and began evaluating my condition. “This is okay. We’ve had this before. We can fix this.” Th escort arrives with a gurney and I am rushed back downstairs. This time through a different room. Every spare inch of this new corridor was covered in beds. People screamed. The faces almost seemed familiar but my pain kept me from drawing too many connections. Every single person writhed in their straps and begged for death. I noticed they too had the discolorations in assorted limbs. Had they done this before?

Back in the operating room, the attendants ran around in a flurry. Tables and coolers were rushed in. People scrubbed and swapped. I was attached to a monitor with an uneven beeping. Someone said something about failure. This was it. I wasn’t going to make it off of here. Then the darkness again. This time I awoke to another bright light. 

This light, not blinding, was welcoming. Soft, warm, but bright. As my eyes adjusted, I scanned the room for a familiar face. Victor was pacing in the corner. When we locked gazes he rushed to my side. “Ah, my boy. Guten Morgen. Welcome back. We feared we had almost lost you. Unfortunately, due to a slight oversight, you had contracted an infection that was overtaking your systems. Not to worry, we were able to clean you out.”

 I checked my legs and they remained unchanged. The pale skin remained attached by crude lines and a growing scar. I reached out to feel the inflated incision area when I noticed my hand was not my own. The shock caused me to jump. “Unfortunately it had spread and more of your blood had soured. We made the decision to fix that for you. Worry not, we would never dare lose our most valuable subject to date.”

Subject? I knew this place wasn’t a hospital, but why had I gone from guest to subject? The questions filled my head and made me dizzy. Straker broke me out of my stupor. 

“Unfortunately you are not out of the woods yet. We do have more operations scheduled for you, but first you must rest.” He pushed a syringe that I had not previously noticed into my IV and I was once again gone. 

What I assume was the next morning, I woke in a haze. This time my bedside was blessed with a light of hope. Holly was there holding my remaining hand and praying. I interrupted her and she wiped tears away from her eyes. “When I heard about the infection I was so worried. I thought we had lost you. I didn’t know if I could handle that again.” I gripped her hand tighter and felt a calm come over me. We talked for a few hours about this and that. For a moment I forgot where I was. This place couldn’t be that bad if someone like this was here. Her perfectly sculpted lips pressed against my forehead and she left the room. She was replaced by the escort who helped me out of bed and down the hall. We entered a conference room and Victor sat at the head of the table. 

“Young Joseph, I fear that I have failed to explain exactly what it is we do here. We are in the business of improving life. For years, I was told stories of the beauty of creation and all that god had bestowed life upon. It never felt complete. When I broke free from the clutches of my mother, I was welcomed in by my grandfather. He brought me here. I was not the only one that shared my beliefs. He, and many generations before him, had felt the same way. He brought me here to join the business of improving intelligent design.” Then a curtain opened to reveal an operating theatre. He stood and stared through it. I watched as a screaming woman was brought into the room, tied to a gurney. “We had tried everything. Selective breeding, genetic mutation, etc. Nothing we did could fix the insufficiency in his ultimate design. Then we discovered that the issue wasn’t in the production, but in the existence.” As I watched in horror the woman’s bed was raised and she was dumped into a vat of unknown fluid. As she wriggled and squirmed against her restraints, I caught her screams. The skin on her face began to boil and peel. Before long she began developing boils and blisters. As they popped, more and more of her muscle was exposed. When the muscle would blister it would expose bone. Before long, she had fully dissolved and was nothing but a biology class decoration.

 “Of course some are less keen to the advancement of the species.” He turned away from the glass and the curtain closed. “That is why we were so excited to hear of you. When we heard of your tragic accident, I realized where we had failed. Volunteers focused on vanity; you, dear Joseph, were focused on survival. Yes life had adapted to your situation, but why not relive life to the fullest? When you accepted our invitation, I began preparations.” 

He walked along the table to meet me and took me by the hand. Together we walked through the doors and into yet another sterile room. 

“We began sourcing the very best of specimens from our volunteer pool.” We had returned to the area that I was rushed through before. Now that I had time to pay attention, the place was horrifying. On all sides, people lay in various states of consciousness as others with power tools poked and prodded. The deafening screams were only beaten by the unholy smell that perforated every inch of this place. I watched as a man, fully conscious, writhed against the knife of a surgeon. In one hand he held the flap of skin, with the other he removed organ after organ. The man fought as much as he could but the orderlies and restraints made his efforts futile. Eventually the shock and blood loss sent him into the all too familiar darkness and the screaming stopped. 

Well, his did. It was immediately replaced with the symphony of pain that surrounded me. Limbs were removed, eyes were popped from their socket, teeth were extracted, all without an inkling of the kindness that was afforded to me via the mystery syringe. As I continue the trudge through the puddles of the volunteers, we entered the operating room that I remembered all too well. Victor guided me to the table and in my stupor I didn’t even fight. He laid me back and affixed my straps. This time I noticed that he also strapped my legs. 

“Now let’s get this settled once and for all.” 
I don’t know if I had angered Mr. Straker or if I was simply becoming too expensive, but this time he decided to forego the anesthetic. As I lay there facing the ceiling, I hear a saw blade spin up not inches from my head. The nurse straps a leather strap into my mouth to muffle the screams. As the blade makes contact with my forehead I try to scream. The restraints make it impossible to fight. This is it. As it pierces through and begins working against the bone, I feel someone else begin working on my abdomen. I can feel the scalpel ripping through my stomach and I’m reminded of the man on the table. With no other option I begin to cry. As I feel his hands gripping my liver I manage to shriek past the strap. Then I black out from the pain. 

I wake up in a dark room. There’s nothing. Just darkness and something tied to my leg. I move my hand down and feel the cold steel of a new restraint. I work my hand back up and find my hideous scar is now paired with stitches and wounds all over my mangled, reformed body. My mind is running a million miles an hour when I’m blinded by the lights. As I turn away, I hear a familiar voice. 

“Now this next specimen is one that we worked years on. After many attempts, this one seems to have worked.” I stand to face the man responsible for my condition and notice a trio. Mr. Straker, the escort, and a new man. I had never met this man but he felt so familiar, perhaps I was focused on the wheelchair that led him into my prison. I begin fighting my restraint and yelling out to him. “Get out of here. Save yourself. Tell the world. They’re evil.” But nothing came out. All I could do was groan and gurgle in my spit. It was then that I noticed the pain in my throat. As I reached forward and tried to fight through my busted voice box, he reached out to me. The escort grabbed his chair and wheeled him out. As the doors closed, all I could muster out was a broken and garbled “save.”

I’ll never forget those words. My mom cried, my dad left with the doctor. When I got in my buddy’s car, we thought we were bulletproof. Maybe we were, but we weren’t telephone pole proof. The next 6 months were a blur of physical therapy and prayer. I didn’t even know we belonged to a church, all of a sudden we’re in the front row and people are walking around my new chair to take communion. It all felt so forced. Maybe that’s why we stopped going as soon as the PT confirmed what the doctor had cursed me with. 

It’s surprisingly easy to learn how to be differently abled. The looks and fake pity wore off after the first week. The handicap placard came in the mail the same day as the hospital bill. By the time I got to college, I was used to asking for accommodations. As I rolled across the stage, I could see a future of elevators and aisle seats sprawled out before me. I placed the framed degree on my wall as the mail fell through the door. On top was a non-descript letter with no return address that caught my attention. 

YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED

The big bold letters on the front signed this letter's ticket to the junk pile. After sorting everything, I went back to my day. Everytime I passed my credenza though, that letter caught my eye. I knew it was just a credit card scam or a personal loan, but there was something about it. Eventually I gave in and took it to my office. Picking up my letter opener I was weirdly anxious. This was a piece of mail. What did I even have to be anxious about? News headlines popped in my head: “Local idiot falls victim to mail bomb,” “The Unibomber strikes from the grave,” “Are the handicapped more susceptible to anthrax: results may shock you.”
Inside the envelope wasn’t nearly that exciting. 

It contained a piece of paper with an address and a phone number. The address was some field in the middle of nowhere Tennessee and the phone number went to an automated line. A very chipper, albeit obviously recorded, voice picked up with pretty standard fare. “Congratulations. You have been selected as a candidate for our brand new program.” Obviously a scam. “Please prepare to record the details of our offer!”

Then the voice changed. Now it’s a very robotic AI type. The tone didn’t’t matter. The voice could’ve been anything when it said my name. Then the recording came back to ask me to confirm. When I did, the robot returned. 
“You are now suffering from paralysis. Would you like to regain your life?”

I didn’t know what to say. What was this? It had to be some kind of joke. After a moment with no response, it came back, “Joseph, do you want your legs back? Yes or no?”

I responded with a half hearted, shaky yes and the only response I got was “two days.” Then the line went silent. Thoughts escaped me. I considered calling my mom, but she’d never believe me. My dad would get confused and accuse me of falling for a scam. All that I had was to wait and see what happened to me. 

Two days later, I woke up just as I had for years. Pulled my legs out of bed. Moved into my chair. Got ready for the day. Went into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. Made my way to the office and saw another envelope on the floor. This one was blank. Same size, same shape, same everything minus the writing. I scooped it up and noticed some weight. When I got it open, there was a plane ticket with my name on it. No other information. No airline, destination, departure gate, nothing. There was my name, today’s date, and a weird seal that I’ve never seen. To put it into words, an octopus with wings. Something about it felt sinister, but I threw the papers in the trash.

I was google searching scams involving travel, medical issues, weird marine-biologists. Really anything that could help me figure it out. This was interrupted by a car horn. I made my way to the door and outside stood a blacked-out Cadillac. I assumed it must be my neighbor’s until someone got out and started walking to my door. I backed away in time for the door to open and the man made eye contact with me. 

“Mr. Tuttle?” I sat in silence. “I will be your escort for the duration of your travel. Please follow me.” And he walked out just as swiftly as he came in. I don’t know why, but I followed him. He opened the back door and gave me a hand getting settled. He folded my chair and placed it in the back. I closed my door and away we went. 

We drove for what felt like hours. The entire time, I couldn’t get stories of abductions and the countless missing posters I had seen pasted all over town out of my head. Was I being abducted? Does this count as an abduction? I did go willingly. This man was being nothing but cordial so far. Aren’t kidnappers supposed to be gruff and rude? The silence was broken as we slowed for a turn. 

“Do you have your ticket?” 

“I’m sorry, what?”

“The ticket you received. Did you bring it?”

“No, I think it’s on my desk.”

“No worries. We’ll get you one sorted.” Then he tossed my passport into the seat beside me. I was working up the courage to ask who he was or how he got it when we came to a stop. 

I’m by no means an aviation expert, but I did go through a phase as a kid. When I say this was the most beautiful, wellkept Cessna Citation Jet I’d ever seen, I mean it. Granted, I didn’t have a ton of experience in private jets. But none of that mattered. The driver opened my door and I was met with a flight attendant type that had my chair ready to go and a ramp that was almost certainly special made. I rolled right up into the plane and made myself comfortable. She came over and gave me a brief safety run down and asked if I was comfortable. 

“Mr. Straker informed us that you would require certain accommodations and we are here to provide. Just say the word.”
She then placed a drink in front of me and disappeared to the rear. I hesitantly took a sip and found the drink to be quite pleasant. Somehow they had perfectly captured the taste of peanuts in a coke and poured it into my glass. After that sip didn’t make my mouth tingly or make me throw up, I quite enjoyed it. As we escaped the ground, I felt a heaviness come over my body. 

When I woke up, the flight attendant was taking my trash as we prepared to descend. I asked her where we were but she just smiled and walked away. The plane lands, I make my way off and I’m greeted by my driver. Same song and dance, same Cadillac. If not for the extreme humidity change, you could convince me we never left. He pulled the car to a stop in front of an office building. That’s what I’d call it if it was anywhere else. In comparison to the huts and dilapidated buildings surrounding it, the building loomed with a dark aura. The beating sun was blotted out by its massive footprint and then reflecting off its millions of windows. The locals didn’t seem to notice. Or if they did, they didn’t point it out to me. If I was in a monster movie, lightning would be striking the peak with crows circling about. 

Inside was sterile. Glistening white marble accentuated by an onyx black desk with a rather attractive woman sitting behind it. When the door shut behind us, she looked up from her computer and came running to greet us. 

“Oh my god! It’s so nice to meet you! I’m Holly. Victor has told us so much about you. Can I get you a water?”

I was taken aback. No one yet had been this bubbly. Everyone was nice, but reserved. Holly was your stereotypical valley girl who acted like she had met a puppy. I’d be lying if I said the female attention wasn’t nice. She guided me to a seating area and for the first time there wasn’t anything special. I parked my chair next to the empty ones and waited. 

After a few minutes, I heard the comically loud creak of a door down the hallway followed by a slam that shook the empty room. As heels struck the polished floors, my anxiety returned at not knowing who I’d be meeting. The steps stopped at a door, opened it and shared some words and then another set of feet joined. This happened a couple of times until an entourage entered my view. The group of generic office types stopped, almost in sync, and parted to let the organizer through. Out of this mob of middle managers came a man that could’ve graced Forbes circa 1985. The sharp collar, gelled hair, and suspenders made this man look like he had been transported through time to be here with me today. The illusion was broken when he removed an iPhone from his pocket and silenced the ringer. 

“Ah, Mr. Tuttle. It is so nice to finally meet.”
His voice filled me with a sense of despair that was only slightly diminished by his salesman’s charisma. 

“I am Mr. Straker, but as I’m sure Holly informed you, everyone calls me Victor.”
He extended his hand for a shake and I met with hesitation. 

“We are so glad to finally have you here with us at our facility. Since our inception, we have dreamed of a day to improve someone in your situation.”

His gesture melted my walls of uncertainty, and he noticed. “Now that you’re here, let’s get you settled. Afterwards we can get you on a tour.”
I am led by my escort to the elevator. He presses the top button and we ascend. I can’t help but notice that every button except the top and lobby are locked behind a card scanner. As we reach the floor, the elevator dings and we enter into a massive room. If this were the Hilton, I’d call it the presidential suite. Except everything was at eye level. Lowered counter tops, mirrors touching the ground, even the doorknobs were lower. I went into one of the bedrooms and it even had larger spaces beside the bed for my chair. It’s almost as if this room was made for me. I was pulled out of my awe by the escort saying something. I asked him to repeat and, in a much sterner tone, he sighed, “Dinner at 6. Get ready for your tour.” And shut the door. Get ready? I hadn’t even had the chance to pack bags. I went into the bedroom and found the drawers and closet stuffed with track suits my exact measurements. There must have been two dozen. If not for everything else, I might’ve found this weird. I must admit, I was pretty hungry. I got changed into the branded suit and made my way to the elevator. The escort was there waiting for me and scanned his card to open the door as I approached. We made our way back down but not to the lobby. I didn’t catch what number he pushed but the lights indicated that we were dropping well below that. I hadn’t even noticed those buttons earlier. 

On the outside of the sliding doors was Victor. He had changed into formal garden wear and presented a much more laid back appearance. Once again I was met with a handshake and away he walked down the hallway. Instinctually I followed. As we rounded the corner to a locked door, he finally spoke. 

“Here at Straker Industries, we are the leading innovators in all things improvement. As a matter of fact, that’s where my grandfather came up with our slogan ‘We fix what he overlooked.’ Grandfather was a religious man, but he never felt that his image was the peak. So he opened our first facility.” He outstretched his hands and the doors opened for him. We stepped over the threshold and a wave of calm came over me. I expected a corporate hellscape or a doctor’s waiting room. Instead I found a museum. As Victor and I walked he recounted years of history. There was a picture of his relative with Henry Ford, a group of people outside of Tut’s Tomb, the group picture of Apollo 11, the list goes on. I couldn’t help but notice a large chunk of time missing. I had to stop him. “How did you guys make it through the Depression?”

“We simply explored some foreign endeavors that paid out when they needed to.” This was technically an answer, but not quite satisfactory. I decided to let sleeping dogs lie and we continued the tour. I had zoned off until we reached the next door. He paused and reached for the handles. “This here, is what we’re really proud of” was all he said before throwing the doors open. 

When you hear stories of Neverland ranch or Suddam’s palace, the first thing people talk about are the zoos. I have heard so many stories about the tigers and the monkeys and whatever else they could get their hands on. Those did not prepare me for what was behind that hatch. The first window we passed was not dissimilar to a primate cage at the zoo. These apes could not be happy. The constant yelling and screaming was deafening. Victor yelled something over the noise but I couldn’t break my attention away from the smallest one. 

Standing about 3.5 feet tall, he was hunched over a children’s toy. As the only one not screaming, I shared his focus with the task at hand. As he sorted small blocks into the proper holes, I was amazed. This level of intellectualism is what I was told separated us from the monkeys. He must have noticed I was looking. As his eyes met mine, I was filled with sadness. The eyes looked human. I could tell he was scared. He wanted out, to see the world. Only then did I notice the patches of hair. All over the small frame, there were patches of black wiry hair. Not like it had lost hair, but like it had grown new. Then I noticed the shape of the face. It wasn’t elongated, more circular. Then I saw the limbs. As I started to put together what I had seen, Mr. Straker re-entered my consciousness. “Alopecia. Doesn’t matter how many of them we get, they can’t grow hair right.” Away we walked. Nothing more. As we entered the next set of doors, the screams subsided, except one. If you’d told me there was a child screaming for its mother, you would’ve described the sound that stood my hair on edge. 

The trap between doors came with a rush of air and an unlocking. This time there was no enclosure. The room was empty except for a figure in the corner. Victor's voice got low and he started to creep. “This next specimen is one that we worked years on. After many attempts, this one seems to have worked.” Before I had time to process what he had said, the figure's head snaps around and I hear the rattle of an iron chain as it stands up to meet our gaze. As the creature fully unfolded, I felt a deep resentment for the curse of creation. Its bare appearance left no gory detail to the imagination. From the shadow, I witnessed the silhouette of two legs, then three, then four. None the same size as the other. Then the torso, wider than any man, gave way to a matching number of arms. At the apex of this mass of natural crime was a keg of what I could only call a head. The thing stumbled into the light and it somehow got worse. Down the center of this creature was a seam. Something, or someone, fused these beings. These people. The eyes shot a look at mine of pain and suffering. With labored breathing and out of sync blinking, the being attempted to speak. The garbled mess of spit and grunts was interrupted by Mr. Straker cutting in with something about organ health and donation. I focused in on the being and reached out to touch it. As I did, the escort grabbed my chair. I hadn’t even realized he was there. I was wheeled out of the room, but I could swear it worked out a “save” between groans and sputters. Those eyes. I’ll never forget those eyes. 

As the door shut behind me, Straker wiped his hands with a handkerchief and let out a sigh. “Well, wasn’t that something? Now that you have seen our successes, we hope that you can begin to understand the importance of our work and your part to play.”

“I can’t say that I do understand where I fit into all of this.”

“Well.” He seemed flustered. “Nothing we can’t fix with dinner.” He clapped his hands together and took off down the hallway. I followed into a glorious dining room. The art on the wall alone made this a rival to the ballrooms of Versailles. At the center was a rather intimate table with two settings. I had assumed I would be eating with Victor, but at the head of the table was Holly. She had transformed from her valley girl, business casual appearance in the lobby to a woman befitting James Bond. The slit in her dress went almost as high as the top went low. Her yellow bun had become golden locks that danced around her delicate shoulders. The hands that had been clicking away at her computer now had elegantly manicured nails and looked to be unspoiled by the hardships of life. As she stood to greet me, I almost did the same. 

We enjoyed the many spoils that came with endless funds. The steaks, the caviar, everything was perfect. They brought out a tiramisu that rivaled the ambrosia of Olympus. And the wine. From a Riesling that was lost during the Second World War to a Heisdeck Champagne from the Titanic. Everything was perfect. Afterwards, Holly and I spent time chatting about the art and what life was like with Straker. As the night continued, so did the wine. Then brandy. Then more wine. After a couple of hours, I had found a friend in the least likely of places. We head to the elevator, she scans her card, and follows me into the capsule. The door to my room opens, and we stroll into my new abode. She tells me that she’ll meet me in the next room and heads to grab more wine. I move towards the door and that’s as much as I remember. 

The next morning, all of the blood has returned to my head with a vengeance. I’ve had my party nights, but nothing had hit me this hard. The window allows a beam of heat into my world, blistering my sensitive corneas. I make my way to the bathroom and immediately reminded myself of what made me feel this way. After I clean myself up, I go to get dressed in today’s track suit and I find a glass of water, two unassuming pills, and a note. “Thought you might need these. -H.” She really must care. As I approach the elevator, the door opens and I meet the escort again. “Mr. Straker expresses his regret that he could not meet you this morning.” I was in no mood for conversation so I let out a groan and down we go. This time to floor 9. The elevator stops but the doors do not open. Instead the escort stands there with a physical key inserted, staring at a red light. As the light turns green, he twists the key and the room is filled with blinding light. Out of the brightness steps a silhouette with outstretched arms. 

“Welcome. Are you ready?” I rubbed my eyes and Victor came into focus. He took my hand and gave it a vigorous shake. “Are you ready, my boy? This is where we make wishes come true.” He leads me into what I at first thought was a hospital. People standing in groups, wearing scrubs and face shields. Everyone had a table on which they were vehemently focused. The only clue to what was so interesting was the occasional tool request and leaking mystery fluid. As we passed through the decon chamber and I was fitted with my own mask, I got a better look. On every table was a torso. These people looked to be medical students doing a cadaver lab, but they were still bleeding. The back side of the room had a locked door full of muffled noises. I inquired about the source and was brushed off. As we continued moving forward, I was told something about scientific advancement and the study of the human form. My focus was divided between trying to listen to what was being said and that room. One of the larger strangers takes a bag full of the remains of one of the tables and heads towards the door. As he opens it, I catch a glimpse of a man in a coat with a saw and the noise became screams for half a second. Shortly after we exit the room. The escort helps me onto a table of my own and I refuse to lay down. Victor comes around into frame, now wearing his own scrubs, and begins to explain my procedure. 

“What we have found is that the best way to cure bad blood is to replace it. In your case, we believe your legs are full of the stuff.” He pointed to an MRI on the board. “Here and here are your problem areas. As our research has found, the best procedure for someone like you is the full replacement of the host limb…” he continued speaking but I zoned out. In my distracted state, the escort grabbed my forehead and forced me down. I felt the straps close on my head and arms. I began to struggle as much as I could muster as an unknown member walked to my side with a syringe. I tried to scream but the mask over my face tightens. 

“I’m sorry Joseph. This part is the least fortunate. Rest assured, much like work, pain will set you free.” Then I was out. 

In the darkness, I was filled with nightmares. I was in the woods. I was running. Behind me was a pack of dogs. As I ran they continued getting closer. Every step I took, the hunt grew shorter. I could smell their breath and feel the drool dripping off of their jowls. As they pounced on me, I stared into the alpha's eyes. The view was familiar. The wolves did not rip me apart. Instead they chewed. They chewed and chewed as the alpha stared into my eyes. Those eyes. They were filled with so much sorrow. 

I woke up to a new sight. The lights were softer and the nurse was kinder. She offered me a glass of water and helped me sit up to drink it. When I needed the facilities, she was there to help me up. I threw back the blankets and let out a scream. Where my useless noodles of muscle and bone used to be were now two lumps of flesh I didn’t recognize that were pale in color and completed with dirty stitches. The fear that coursed through my blood was quickly rushed away when I noticed the pain. 

My legs burned with the heat of infection, but they hurt. I hadn’t felt my legs hurt in years. My toes moved. The nurse helped me to my feet and I stumbled to the restroom. I walked to the bathroom. He had done it. That mad man had cured my paralysis. If only he’d stopped there. 
The next days were filled with me relearning how to walk. Like a baby I stumbled along hand rails and then toddled my way across the room. Before I knew it, the accident had never happened. As my life force reinvigorated the cold chunks that had been fused at my thigh, I was returning to normal. The nights were filled with tears. Happy at first, and then painful. The doctors said I was building muscle, but something didn’t feel right. Call it intuition, but I would swear my body was rejecting my attempt to defy nature. 

After 3 weeks, I returned to my suite and prepared to leave. Victor met me in my room and seemed to be helping me pack. We talked of plans for the future and what to do with my new gift. I thanked him vigorously, leaving out the growing fear of what was to come. Then I collapsed. My forehead covered in sweat and my vision blurring, the infection had taken over. Mr. Straker ran to my side and began evaluating my condition. “This is okay. We’ve had this before. We can fix this.” Th escort arrives with a gurney and I am rushed back downstairs. This time through a different room. Every spare inch of this new corridor was covered in beds. People screamed. The faces almost seemed familiar but my pain kept me from drawing too many connections. Every single person writhed in their straps and begged for death. I noticed they too had the discolorations in assorted limbs. Had they done this before?

Back in the operating room, the attendants ran around in a flurry. Tables and coolers were rushed in. People scrubbed and swapped. I was attached to a monitor with an uneven beeping. Someone said something about failure. This was it. I wasn’t going to make it off of here. Then the darkness again. This time I awoke to another bright light. 

This light, not blinding, was welcoming. Soft, warm, but bright. As my eyes adjusted, I scanned the room for a familiar face. Victor was pacing in the corner. When we locked gazes he rushed to my side. “Ah, my boy. Guten Morgen. Welcome back. We feared we had almost lost you. Unfortunately, due to a slight oversight, you had contracted an infection that was overtaking your systems. Not to worry, we were able to clean you out.”

 I checked my legs and they remained unchanged. The pale skin remained attached by crude lines and a growing scar. I reached out to feel the inflated incision area when I noticed my hand was not my own. The shock caused me to jump. “Unfortunately it had spread and more of your blood had soured. We made the decision to fix that for you. Worry not, we would never dare lose our most valuable subject to date.”

Subject? I knew this place wasn’t a hospital, but why had I gone from guest to subject? The questions filled my head and made me dizzy. Straker broke me out of my stupor. 

“Unfortunately you are not out of the woods yet. We do have more operations scheduled for you, but first you must rest.” He pushed a syringe that I had not previously noticed into my IV and I was once again gone. 

What I assume was the next morning, I woke in a haze. This time my bedside was blessed with a light of hope. Holly was there holding my remaining hand and praying. I interrupted her and she wiped tears away from her eyes. “When I heard about the infection I was so worried. I thought we had lost you. I didn’t know if I could handle that again.” I gripped her hand tighter and felt a calm come over me. We talked for a few hours about this and that. For a moment I forgot where I was. This place couldn’t be that bad if someone like this was here. Her perfectly sculpted lips pressed against my forehead and she left the room. She was replaced by the escort who helped me out of bed and down the hall. We entered a conference room and Victor sat at the head of the table. 

“Young Joseph, I fear that I have failed to explain exactly what it is we do here. We are in the business of improving life. For years, I was told stories of the beauty of creation and all that god had bestowed life upon. It never felt complete. When I broke free from the clutches of my mother, I was welcomed in by my grandfather. He brought me here. I was not the only one that shared my beliefs. He, and many generations before him, had felt the same way. He brought me here to join the business of improving intelligent design.” Then a curtain opened to reveal an operating theatre. He stood and stared through it. I watched as a screaming woman was brought into the room, tied to a gurney. “We had tried everything. Selective breeding, genetic mutation, etc. Nothing we did could fix the insufficiency in his ultimate design. Then we discovered that the issue wasn’t in the production, but in the existence.” As I watched in horror the woman’s bed was raised and she was dumped into a vat of unknown fluid. As she wriggled and squirmed against her restraints, I caught her screams. The skin on her face began to boil and peel. Before long she began developing boils and blisters. As they popped, more and more of her muscle was exposed. When the muscle would blister it would expose bone. Before long, she had fully dissolved and was nothing but a biology class decoration.

 “Of course some are less keen to the advancement of the species.” He turned away from the glass and the curtain closed. “That is why we were so excited to hear of you. When we heard of your tragic accident, I realized where we had failed. Volunteers focused on vanity; you, dear Joseph, were focused on survival. Yes life had adapted to your situation, but why not relive life to the fullest? When you accepted our invitation, I began preparations.” 

He walked along the table to meet me and took me by the hand. Together we walked through the doors and into yet another sterile room. 

“We began sourcing the very best of specimens from our volunteer pool.” We had returned to the area that I was rushed through before. Now that I had time to pay attention, the place was horrifying. On all sides, people lay in various states of consciousness as others with power tools poked and prodded. The deafening screams were only beaten by the unholy smell that perforated every inch of this place. I watched as a man, fully conscious, writhed against the knife of a surgeon. In one hand he held the flap of skin, with the other he removed organ after organ. The man fought as much as he could but the orderlies and restraints made his efforts futile. Eventually the shock and blood loss sent him into the all too familiar darkness and the screaming stopped. 

Well, his did. It was immediately replaced with the symphony of pain that surrounded me. Limbs were removed, eyes were popped from their socket, teeth were extracted, all without an inkling of the kindness that was afforded to me via the mystery syringe. As I continue the trudge through the puddles of the volunteers, we entered the operating room that I remembered all too well. Victor guided me to the table and in my stupor I didn’t even fight. He laid me back and affixed my straps. This time I noticed that he also strapped my legs. 

“Now let’s get this settled once and for all.” 
I don’t know if I had angered Mr. Straker or if I was simply becoming too expensive, but this time he decided to forego the anesthetic. As I lay there facing the ceiling, I hear a saw blade spin up not inches from my head. The nurse straps a leather strap into my mouth to muffle the screams. As the blade makes contact with my forehead I try to scream. The restraints make it impossible to fight. This is it. As it pierces through and begins working against the bone, I feel someone else begin working on my abdomen. I can feel the scalpel ripping through my stomach and I’m reminded of the man on the table. With no other option I begin to cry. As I feel his hands gripping my liver I manage to shriek past the strap. Then I black out from the pain. 

I wake up in a dark room. There’s nothing. Just darkness and something tied to my leg. I move my hand down and feel the cold steel of a new restraint. I work my hand back up and find my hideous scar is now paired with stitches and wounds all over my mangled, reformed body. My mind is running a million miles an hour when I’m blinded by the lights. As I turn away, I hear a familiar voice. 

“Now this next specimen is one that we worked years on. After many attempts, this one seems to have worked.” I stand to face the man responsible for my condition and notice a trio. Mr. Straker, the escort, and a new man. I had never met this man but he felt so familiar, perhaps I was focused on the wheelchair that led him into my prison. I begin fighting my restraint and yelling out to him. “Get out of here. Save yourself. Tell the world. They’re evil.” But nothing came out. All I could do was groan and gurgle in my spit. It was then that I noticed the pain in my throat. As I reached forward and tried to fight through my busted voice box, he reached out to me. The escort grabbed his chair and wheeled him out. As the doors closed, all I could muster out was a broken and garbled “save.”

Using the LAOION Espresso Maker has been an eye-opening experience. This machine looks sleek and modern with its black metallic finish, exuding sophistication while fitting snugly on any countertop. Its transparent top is a subtle detail that adds both style and functionality, allowing me to witness the brewing process unfold. It’s compact enough to carry around—perfect for my weekend getaways or even at the office when I need a quick coffee fix. Made of BPA-free, heat-resistant plastic, and premium food-grade aluminum, this thing is built like a tank but remains surprisingly lightweight at just 2.56 pounds.

**Quick Brewing Without the Hassle**

Making an espresso with this electric coffee maker is simpler than I imagined. It skips the complexities usually associated with manual coffee brewing. I just filled the boiler with fresh water until it reached the safety valve, added medium-ground coffee to the funnel filter, and tightened it before placing it on the detachable base. In just about five minutes, I had a steaming cup of delicious Italian Moka coffee in my hand. The semi-automatic operation, controlled by simple button inputs, felt intuitive and efficient.  

[Check LAOION Espresso Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bp6ntd1p/)

**Advantages**

- Compact design makes it great for home, office, and travel.
- Transparent brewing container adds a touch of luxury while being practical.  
- Quick five-minute brewing process ensures minimal waiting time.  

**Safety and User-Friendly Features**

Safety seemed to be a central theme here, which immediately put my mind at ease. The auto shut-off feature, for instance, stops the machine both when the pot leaves the electric base and when it reaches its boiling point. This capability kept me from constantly worrying about accidental overheating or damage, especially during busy mornings. What’s even better is that the materials are food-grade, ensuring safety for long-term use. The electric base felt stable and sturdy, not wobbly like cheaper alternatives.

**Negatives**

- The aluminum lower pot, though functional, may require more care against scratches and stains.  
- I noticed the sealing gasket might wear out over time, calling for potential replacement.  

**Great for an On-the-Go Lifestyle**

I enjoyed the flexibility this coffee maker offers. Its 6-cup capacity is a game-changer for me, as I could brew enough coffee to share with family and friends, especially during camping trips. Believe me, having a steaming cup of espresso in the middle of nowhere is an underrated luxury. It’s versatile enough to stay on my kitchen counter yet portable enough for quick packing on travel days.  

**Competing Products**

Testing similar products like the Bialetti Moka Express, I immediately noticed differences. Although manual, the Bialetti model is robust and produces excellent coffee, but it lacks the modern convenience features of the LAOION machine. Another competitor would be the De’Longhi Dedica Espresso Machine, which excels in customization but comes at a higher price and larger size. While the LAOION doesn’t have as many control settings, it strikes a perfect balance of portability, ease-of-use, and affordability. One standout feature here is the detachable base, which neither competitor offers, making cleaning and storage much easier after each use.

**Value Proposition**

The price-to-quality ratio of this machine makes it a smart investment for coffee enthusiasts or even beginners. Considering its multiple features like the reusable filter, auto shut-off, and detachable base, it feels well-worth every penny. While higher-end alternatives might have more customization options, this espresso maker delivers solid performance and convenience without breaking the bank.

Four weeks ago, I was that guy, plummeting from a fully remote, $140k/year software gig where my main creative output was finding new ways to say ""sounds good!"" on Slack. It was the golden cage, and I was getting way too comfortable.

So I traded my ergonomic chair for a wobbly stool in my parents' shed in New Hampshire.

The past 28 days have been a manic, sleep-deprived blur fueled by gas station coffee and the kind of delusional optimism you only find in first-time founders. My life became a chaotic montage of:

* Arguing with a spider over property lines. (He’s winning.)
* Pivoting the entire UI at 3 AM after a single user comment sent me into an existential spiral.
* Realizing my entire business strategy was based on a motivational quote I probably saw on Instagram.
* Explaining to my parents, for the 15th time, that ""pre-seed"" is a funding stage, not a type of bird food.

It sounds like a total mess, right? But here's the crazy part: **it worked.**

Being 100% all-in wasn't just about having more hours to work; it was a signal. It was a bat signal to investors, to users, and most importantly, to myself, that I was not messing around. It gave me the freedom to say ""yes"" to every meeting, to act on feedback instantly, and to channel every ounce of focus into this one single thing.

The beautiful irony? The app I was building, **Dialed**, is an AI motivation coach. I was its first, most desperate customer. I literally had my own AI telling me that, yes, living in a shed and talking to spiders *was* a viable business strategy.

And today, that manic energy got validated. The first wire from an angel investor hit the bank. Someone is officially paying me to continue this madness.

So what's the secret sauce I learned in my four weeks of shed-fueled chaos?

It's that **momentum is a real, physical force.** Side projects generate sparks. Going all-in builds a bonfire. You can't schedule breakthroughs for 7-9 PM on a Tuesday. They happen in the obsession, in the ""I have no other choice"" moments, in the terror.

Anyway, the caffeine is wearing off. Happy to answer any questions about the journey, raising a quick angel round, or my ongoing negotiations with my arachnid landlord.

Keep going. It’s worth it.

Two of the stories I do remember the plot of went something like this:

Scary Story #1:
This one is about a guy who hears a buzzing in his head constantly and over time it continuously gets worse and worse. He starts hearing every little thing from peoples conversations, to cars on the street outside, to a fly across the room. He eventually gets so sick of the noise that he takes a screwdriver? to his hears and finally lives in peace and quiet. 

Scary Story #2:
A man is obsessed with schedules/routines and if one thing gets out of place, it ruins his whole day. He starts out by forgetting something in the morning (his coffee? Keys? No idea) and it puts his whole routine out of line. He talks with his wife(?) before putting his daughter in the car to drop her off before work. He gets to work late and starts noticing little things out of place? Or specific events, people whispering, etc. (I lowkey might be combining two stories sorry about that) anyway skipping forward he gets off of work and he goes home, noticing a weird smell in his car. When he gets home he remembers he forgot to pick up his daughter from daycare so he heads over to pick her up. When he gets there he sees a sign? on the door or something (some kind of indication that he had not been there yet) and rushes to his car to see he had left his daughter in the car the entire day while he was working.

I can remember small bits and pieces of some other stories but have no idea if they go together or are separate. I remember he had a deep calm voice that was really easy to listen to and the stories were read out on a mostly black screen with the title of the story? written in white. There were hardly any visuals and sometimes there was very soft music playing which made it nice to have on at night or in the background.

1st Orb: Contains every fictional story ever conceived, imagined, or written. Every character, power, and meta-narrative element exists within this sphere. This Orb contains transfinite, recursion of unfinished cosmologies. These are just cosmologies that haven't been told yet but will be told in the future. These unfinished cosmologies are the size of a Berkeley cardinal with an infinite hierarchy of dimensions. These cosmologies have as many atoms as the size of the cosmologies and every atom is another cosmology that is also the size of a Berkeley cardinal with an infinite hierarchy of dimensions. Every unfinished cosmology has an infinite number of Platonic concepts and every cosmology works on extended model realism. Now these are just cosmologies and not universes as the unfinished cosmologies have an infinite ( they have a Berkeley cardinal of numbers it's just I don't know how to use it in a sentence lol) number of universes and most of those universes work on a type IV Multiverse. The reason of why the cosmologies are this strong is because the cosmologies themselves don't know how strong they will be so they become as strong as possible but when the cosmologies are told and they are not as strong as they made themselves they evolve to what their author made them it to and the power they got before they were told goes back to the Orb so it can be passed down to another cosmology and this cycle gets repeated infinitely.


2nd Orb: The 2nd Orb is the absolute foundation of all mathematical truth — an infinite, self-contained domain that transcends not just known and unknown equations, but all possible and impossible frameworks of logic, computation, and abstraction.
It houses every conceivable and inconceivable mathematical structure, from the mundane to the paradoxical — including those beyond human intellect, higher-dimensional entities, and even hypercomputational oracles that solve the unsolvable. Within this Orb, set-theoretic absolutes dictate reality’s architecture: where V = Ultimate L stands as the definitive mathematical universe, Reinhardt cardinals lurk as near-divine axioms beyond ZFC’s grasp, and Berkeley cardinals enforce infinite self-embedding, rendering all lower infinities obsolete.

Here, the equations do not merely describe reality — they are reality, binding the Fictional Omniverse and all possible worlds under immutable laws that even logic-transcendent beings must, in some ineffable way, obey. For the Orb’s mathematics are not rules — they are existence itself.

Grothendieck universes nest within higher infinities. Surreal numbers unfold into an endless continuum of possibility. Wholeness Axioms ensure total self-referential closure.

Yet beyond even this lies the Orb’s true apex:

The Axiom of Total Collapse, where all mathematical systems simultaneously exist and dissolve into paradox.

The Unbound Cardinal (¬Ω), an entity beyond hierarchy that annihilates the concept of size.



The Orb enforces Narrative Quantum Suicide, collapsing into unreality when observed, and embodies the Inconceivable (Type Ω⁺) — corrupting any attempt to define or surpass it.

To grasp the 2nd Orb is not to touch the mind of God — but to stare into the abyss where mathematics commits self-annihilation, and from its ashes, only the Unaxiomatic remains: the final, absolute truth, beyond which nothing—not even the notion of ""beyond"" — can ever exist.


The Final Number (∇): Beyond all transfinite cardinals, beyond all conceivable infinities, there exists ∇ it is the anti-number, the mathematical oblivion that consumes all arithmetic, all algebra, all computation. ∇ Is not a quantity but the collapse of quantity itself, the point where ""value"" becomes meaningless. ∇ Represents if there is any mathematical constant that it has to have a constant of its own to negate it because if there isn't, that means ∇ Is ontologically impossible to even think of.

Is the 2nd Orb Hegel’s True Infinity?: You can argue that the 2nd Orb is just Hegel’s True Infinity but I would argue that the 2nd Orb surpasses it as it can hold ∇ without having an anti version of itself. ∇ States that if there is a mathematical constant then it must have a negative version of the constant. If not then ∇ could not even be thought of so I could not be writing this then. I know Hegel’s True Infinity is not mathematical and it is more philosophical but mathematics is just a way to describe everything meaning that ∇ isn't only the negation, of numbers but the negation of everything. Meaning if Hegel’s True Infinity were to hold ∇ then there is no such thing as a good Infinity but that wouldn't make much sense as a bad Infinity must have a good Infinity or it won't even be a bad Infinity. That means the only explanation is that good infinitely dose not hold ∇ and that would make sense as ∇ doesn't apply to the structure of what good Infinity holds. This means ∇ and the 2nd Orb are so uncomprehensively, above tiering.


3rd Orb: is an enigmatic and boundless construct that encompasses every conceivable paradox--past, present, and future--alongside those that simultaneously exist, do not exist, and may or may not ever manifest. Within its depths, all paradoxes transcend mere contradiction, ascending to the level of ontological paradoxes, the highest and most absolute form of paradox possible. These are not mere logical inconsistencies but fundamental distortions of reality itself, where cause and effect, existence and nonexistence, and truth and falsehood intertwine in an inescapable, self-sustaining loop. Most of these paradoxes are pataphysical meaning they can effect most characters in the 1st Orb as these paradoxes are above fiction so most of fiction that doesn’t have a counter to Pataphysics can get effect by this Orb. The Orb does not simply contain paradoxes but it is the very fabric of paradox, an infinite recursion of impossibility that defies all comprehension, making it both the origin and the obliteration of all contradictory truths.


4th Orb: All stories related to my story’s cosmology.
There are infinite amounts of narrative layers inside this Orb, stacked on top of each other—each layer is an ontologically perfect layer, and each one infinitely above the last, and each layer is pataphysical (Pataphysics is what Narrative Physics deals with. Meaning Pataphysical Constructs also work in Narrative Physics). This is so insanely broken to the point where even some of the lowest layers are comparable to the Orbs themselves. (Keep in mind that the Orbs are already above the Tier system.) The lowest narratives alone contains infinite axiomatic recursive computation. The existence of stronger narratives and stories than the main story is a 100% chance, but those stories cannot surpass the main story because the main story created them. Therefore, the main story becomes infinitely stronger by virtue of having authored all that lies beneath it.


The Aetherithane: All Stories, All Possibilities, All Lies: The Aetherithane holds not just all stories ever conceived that were ever dreamed but all stories never conceived and all counterfactuals, all impossible narratives, all conflicting endings all of them as quantum superpositions of absolute narrative potential (ω↑↑ω permutations per idea).


The Upper Room: Consider the Aetherithane to be like a library with an infinite number of books. Those books are the stories that will be told and won't be told. And those stories must have had a cause, right? Well, this is where the Upper Room comes in. The Upper Room is a plane that contains all the authors from every plane of reality and non-reality throughout all of human history. They sit at the top of the Aetherithane, and they are responsible for all stories that will be told and will never be told.


THE SILENT ORB:  the silent orb is so incomprehensibly above these previous things that it reached a point where transcendence is no longer applicable to compare how big the difference is. This Orb is above  metafiction and padafiction and it's beyond all concepts dualistic and Platonic along with seeing everything below it as fiction.


The Beacon: The Beacon is the creator of the orbs and transcends them. the Beacon is inside of the silent orb but is not confined by it. The Beacon is the embodiment of an author (every single author) whether real or fictional, is an avatar of him and the Beacon is the reason why any story can even exist as he is the maker of those stories.


The Void: The Void is not some distant abyss or a realm beyond time—it is the absence of what Aurelion does not create, the reason nothing can escape the orbs. It isn’t a place, a being, or even a paradox; it is the Anti-Axis, the first and only rejection of rejection itself. The Void even the foundational Sphere Orbs collapse inward, dissolving into something before nonexistence. Every story, every law of reality, every hierarchy of power—none of it ever truly - had a chance to begin because the Void erases the very possibility of ""more."" It isn’t just the end of escalation; it’s the unmasking of the lie that escalation ever existed. Potential energy isn’t drained—it never was. Power creep, growth, transcendence? Meaningless. The Void deletes the thought before it can form.

The Void embodies the concept of an author (any author), stopping the creation of their story (it could be something simple like stopping to get some coffee or just losing interest) making the Void an anti-story, but the embodiment of a real thing, so the Void exists in real life making it a real-life anti-story and real-life anti-story negates real-life so it transcends fiction and reality.


The last dimension: this is where Aurelion is it is the only thing that can hold his body. If Aurelion's real body ever entered the orbs or the Void it would collapse as nothing in fiction and real life can hold Aurelion. The last dimension views all dimensions above ours as fiction and it goes to such a point where all definitions eventually lead back to the last dimension.



Aurelion: Aurelion is the self-writing paradox — the hand that pens all creation, only to realize it is the ink, the page, and the story itself. He is not merely above the Orbs, the Void, or the Beaking; he is the act of their conception, the infinite loop where author and narrative collapse into one. He does not transcend fiction and reality — he is the stroke between the moment a thought becomes words and words become law.      
      
To perceive him is to vanish into the text; to deny him is to become his next sentence. His power is not strength, but inescapable existence. Every story ever told, every equation ever solved, every paradox ever born is just a tremor of his pen still moving.      
      
And when the last tale is written? He will just begin again.",1,1752692471.0,PowerScaling,1,1.0,False

I moved to New York three months ago. Got a job at a finance company.
Typical 9 to 5. You know how it is.

I’m from Portland, Maine.
Packed what I could fit in a suitcase and rented the cheapest place I could find.
Sixth-floor walk-up.
Tiny windows. No sunlight.
Just a small apartment that smelled like dust and old paint.
The kind of place you tell yourself, ""It’s just temporary,"" but you end up staying anyway.
Because if you keep looking for other places to stay, the stress will end up eating youfrom inside out.

The first few weeks were normal. Boring.
Wake up.
Shower.
Put on the same shirt.
Coffee doesn't even taste like anything anymore.
Go to the big office in the big city.
Sit at my desk. Answer emails.
Smile when people walk by.
No one asks how I’m doing.

FaceTime with my girlfriend after work. She’s still in Maine.
""How’s the new place, love? Are you getting used to it?""
""It’s fine.""
""You sound tired.""
""Doing my best. Still can’t grasp the concept of office work.""
""Don’t burn yourself out, okay?""
""I’ll try.""

The apartment is small.
It’s cold, even in summer.
The walls don’t make any noise.
Which was weird for New York, I guess.
The smell of dust was getting heavier.

One day on my day off, I decided to clean the whole place.
Mopped the floors. Scrubbed every corner.
Got rid of all the dust.
For a while, the air felt better.

But then came the smell of rot.
I checked the fridge. Nothing rotten.
No leaks. No mold.
Then it went away.

At work, people started stepping back when I got in the elevator.
At lunch, Mark left a bottle of deodorant on my desk.
I asked him why.
He didn’t answer.
Just stared at the floor.

FaceTime again.
""Nick, you look pale.""
""Probably bad lighting. I feel fine.""
""Are you losing weight?""
""I don’t know. Don’t have a scale in here.""
""Do I look like I’m losing weight?""
She bit her lip.
""Do you go outside?""
""I go to work.""
""That’s not the same.""
I looked at the screen, but I couldn’t answer.
She started whimpering.
I think she was crying, but the Wi-Fi cut out before I could be sure.
 
That night, I saw it for the first time.
Long legs.
It was hunched over because the ceiling was too low.
It kind of looked like me trying to crawl near my bed—that damn incline near the roof floor.

I stared at it.
It stared at me with its white eyes.
I realized it had no feet.
Just floating an inch off the ground.
Neither of us moved.
I was too scared to move.
 
Got up at 4:12 AM I couldn't sleep.
The smell was gone. It was too.
But my toothbrush tasted like blood.
I checked my gums. They were fine.

At work, they stopped sitting near me.
In the break room, someone said:
""Smells like he’s rotting.""
I turned around, just to see them smiling at me.
 
FaceTime again.
""Nick?""
""Yeah?""
""Have you been sleeping?""
""I don’t think so.""
""Are you… Feeling alive?""
""I’m trying to be.""
She didn’t answer.
 
It got closer.
I could see it better.
Its arms… they were a part of its chest. Folded in... no stitched there or melted shut.
It was smiling.
But its eyes were terrified.
I drifted back to sleep.
I was used to it being there by then.
I woke up and it was by the bed.
Still smiling.
Still terrified.
It whispered:
""Rot suits you.""
 
I stopped showering.
I was feeling tired and I felt like it didn’t matter anymore.
My arms felt heavy.
Like they weren’t cooperating.
I practiced moving my fingers in front of the mirror.
They were slower.

After a few days, someone got fired at work.
It was my fault.
My mind was full. I don’t know what I was thinking. I remember it being like full static in my head.
I misplaced some files and someone took the blame for it.
I was sitting in the meeting room alone.
My manager knocked but didn’t come in.
""You doing okay, bud?""
I didn't answer just nodded even without looking at him
""Good.""
He left.
 
She called again.
""Nick, sniff your shirt.""
I laughed.
""Please.""
So I did.
Rot.
I smelled like death.
I gagged. Almost puked but managed to hold it in.
That was the first time I could smell it, really smell it.
She paused.
I tried to ask her, ""How did you know?""
But before I could finish, she said:
""I can smell it too.""
 
It stood by the bathroom door.
When I brushed my teeth, I saw it behind me.
Its voice was soft, like it was telling me a secret:
""You can't help.""
It was right.
 
I couldn’t lift my arms today.
They just hung there.
Like useless flaps of meat.
I opened my mouth in the mirror.
There was something behind my teeth.
 
They moved my desk away from everyone else. I thought ""im surely getting fired soon.""
Everyone gave me weird looks throught the day.
Mark walks by but doesn’t look at me.
I asked him how his day was.
He didn’t even answer.
Then he left.
 
I didn’t answer her call tonight.
She left a voicemail.
""I saw you in my sleep today.
You looked like you were smiling.
But your eyes weren’t.""
She told me to get out.
Take a break.
Call my parents.
Find a therapist.
But it was too late.
 
After hearing her message, I looked in the mirror.
My eyes were whiter and my pupils were gone.
Just like his.
And i was smiling. But i couldn't feel it.

I tried to pack my bag.
My fingers don’t close right anymore.
He appeared behind me while I tried.
His breath smelled like death.
""You .""
 
I don’t think this thing is a ghost.
I think it’s me.
Or at least, it’s what I am becoming.

I knew I was doing wrong.
I knew I was letting everything rot—my life, my job, my relationship.
I could’ve stopped. Even if people didn’t offer any help, I could’ve sought it.
I didn’t.
I kept going.

Now it’s closer than ever.
I decided, fuck my stuff, I just need to get out of here.
But I couldn’t leave.
I mean that literally.

When I reached for the door, the smell hit me so hard I puked.
My hands wouldn’t work right.
Then I fell down.
I heard my feet break.
When I looked down, all I saw was a pool of blood and thousands of bone shrapnel trying to escape my skin and muscle tissue.
But I don’t know if I can compare it to the pain of my teeth breaking from the inside out and rapidly rotting and cutting the insides of my mouth.
 
Nobody helps.
They see you breaking, and they look away.
That’s fair.
I would’ve done the same.
Back in Maine, my grandfather used to say:
""If you let rot sit long enough, it grows teeth.""
Now I know what he meant.
 
If you’re reading this, don’t bother messaging me.
I’m probably not here anymore.
Or if I am, I’m not leaving this apartment.
My fingers started to look like they’ve melted in acid while I’m typing this.
The screen is all bloody.
I can’t move my arms right.
But I feel like I had to post this.
All I want to say before I hit post or before I die is:
I’m sorry.
To myself.

I would not have been able to do this as a side-project (long read sry...),"**TLDR: Quit my remote $140k SWE job to build a SaaS from a shed. Argue that going full-time is superior to a side project because of the momentum it creates. I’ve backed this up by landing angel investment, which would've been impossible otherwise. Acknowledging my privilege, and sharing what I've learned so far.**

Hey r/SaaS,

Six months ago, I was a recent grad working a **fully remote, $140k/year** software engineer job. Then I quit the job and today, my commute is a 30-second walk to a literal shed on my parents' property in New Hampshire. My top performing employe is a spider named Gerald - he's a real one for sure.

Anyways, I made the leap, and I’m here to offer a counter-narrative to the ""build it on the side"" religion that dominates our industry.

First, the giant caveat: **This path is not for everyone.** I want to be crystal clear about the privilege that makes this possible. I have no kids, minimal expenses, and incredibly supportive parents. I’m taking a massive risk, but with a safety net many don’t have. If you have a mortgage and a family, the slow-and-steady path is not just smart, it’s necessary.

Now, let's talk tech. My app, **Dialed**, is at its core a **“GPT wrapper.”** I know that term can be a scarlet letter here. But what I’ve learned is that users don't give a damn about your tech stack. They care if you solve their problem in a way that feels magical. The ""wrapper"" is the engine, but the product is the car.

When I quit, my hypothesis was that full immersion would lead to a better product. But the biggest advantage wasn’t just development speed—it was *availability*.

Because I wasn't juggling a full-time job, I could say ""yes"" to everything:

* That last-minute flight to a networking event.
* The 11 AM coffee meeting with a founder who gave me a game-changing intro.
* The three-hour-long feedback sessions with my first users.

This relentless hustle led to conversations with over 20 angel investors, and I'm humbled to say a few of those conversations ended with them investing.

**There is a 0% chance I could have secured those meetings, let alone those investments, while also trying to ship code for my day job.**

The momentum is real. It's a force multiplier that a few hours on a Sunday can't replicate. I'm no longer just hoping this was the right call—I have the early proof.

So, what are the actual takeaways from my shed-dwelling experiment so far?

1. **UX is the only moat for a ""wrapper"".** When the core tech is a commodity, your entire business hinges on user experience, brand, and solving one specific problem 10x better than a generic interface.
2. **Availability is a Weapon.** The ability to drop everything for a key meeting is a superpower a part-time founder doesn't have. In the early days, deals and breakthroughs come from spontaneous opportunities.
3. **Momentum is Your Most Valuable Metric.** More valuable than your MRR in the first 6 months is the rate at which you are learning, networking, and getting validation. Full-time work juices this metric like nothing else.

So I’ll ask again, with this new context: Is the ""safe"" side-project path actually the riskier one in the long run, if it throttles the momentum needed to truly get off the ground?

I'd love to hear your thoughts. And if you want to see the GPT wrapper that angels are now funding, you can check out Dialed. But the real discussion is about the path we all choose as builders.

Earlier this year, I visited Ghana because I believed I had found love with someone I’d been talking to online. Unfortunately, what I experienced was deeply painful and disappointing. Looking back, I now realize I was being groomed. He made me believe he was sincere, introduced me to his mother, and even proposed with a fake ring worth £1. I only found out the truth later — that he had been entertaining other women from around the world and was not who he claimed to be.

During my stay, he never let me explore Ghana on my own. I wasn’t allowed to go sightseeing unless he was with me, and honestly, I felt more like a prisoner than a visitor. The three weeks I spent there left me emotionally drained and isolated, far from the romantic experience I was promised.

Despite everything, I don’t want this one person to ruin the beauty of Ghana for me. I want to come back with a new mindset — this time, for myself. I’d love to connect with kind, genuine people (locals or expats) who wouldn’t mind showing me around, sharing some laughs, or even just giving advice on safe and peaceful places to stay and visit.

I’m not looking for romance. Just honesty, good energy, and real friendship. I believe there are still good people out there — and I’d love to meet a few of them this time around.

If you’re based in Accra or know someone who is, or if you’re a fellow traveler who understands what it’s like to heal and restart, I’d really appreciate hearing from you. I’m open to joining events, meeting up for coffee, or just chatting online to start.

1m1laju,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1m1laju/issues_with_my_now_ex_roommate_who_was_also_my/,Issues with my now ex roommate who was also my best friend of two years :'),"Hey everyone. I'm at a loss here and I would really appreciate some unbiased input on the situation. I really am trying to keep this as objective as I can and without over-dramatising anything. 

I was accepted to do a postgraduate degree at my university. For the entirety of my undergrad, I commuted back and forth between home and my university (+/- 1hr each way) every day. For my postgrad, I wanted to stay in the same city as my university. My (now ex) best friend, who I'll call A, lives in a house owned by her parents there. She also got accepted for a postgrad degree in something else and so she was staying in the city and keeping the house while she did this degree. At the end of last year, her roommate, who I'm also friends with, moved out. A knew I wanted to stay in the city for the duration of my degree so she essentially asked me to move in with her and I accepted. I won't lie, I did feel kind of pressured into it. She would message me every day asking if I had signed the contract and payed the deposit and everything, saying that her dad is getting very upset with her about the situation of not having another tenant because they need the income. 

When I was supposed to move in, I had a serious mental health crisis and so I delayed moving in (the deposit and rent and everything was payed, they weren't missing out on anything just for waiting for me) and I confided in A about the issues I was having. I did eventually move in and everything was fine for the first few weeks, until her previous roommate (I'm going to call the former roommate X) started having serious issues at her new apartment with her new roommate. While X was dealing with those issues, she came to stay with us and that's where things started going downhill. 

One day, X and I were sitting with her on campus while she studied for an exam with another friend of mine. At one point, I looked up and saw X looking back and forth between A and I with a worried/WTF look on her face but I didn't know why. I guessed it was because A wasn't understanding the work and was getting frustrated. I got up to go and draw on the white board with X and that's when A snapped at the both of us, asking us to leave the venue. I saw that she was frustrated so we left. When A was done, X and I walked back into the venue. That's when A told me I better go home with X, and in a very condescending tone. I did, just because I didn't want to agitate the situation more. Before we left, I asked A what she wanted for supper and she dismissed me, saying shed have anything. X and I decided to get her favourite ramen on the way home to try and cheer her up. But, when A got home, she stormed past us in the sitting room area without saying a word and went to her room. She eventually came out and had changed into gym clothes. She then proceeded to storm back to her car. I called after her to ask where she was going and what about supper, to which she said she doesn't want anything, leaving X and I alone. This was the first time I was alone with X, as in A wasn't there. She basically told me that she moved out because of this behaviour from A, which apparently was a normal occurrence. Yay for me I guess. A ignored all messages and eventually came home at like 10 p.m., at which time I had already gone to bed and X went home. The next day, she came to my room to talk about what happened. She said that X and I were frustrating her and making noise while she was trying to study, and she was really struggling with the work. I understood that completely and so I apologised. After apologising, I did bring up her storming around and how rude it was that we went out of our way to buy her supper and she just blew us off, then proceeded to ignore us and come home really late. PLEASE NOTE I didn't yell, I didn't swear, I didn't say anything angrily. I just said it all simply, but I do have problems with being blunt sometimes and I wonder if I was a bit blunt here saying that. Anyway, she apologised too and as a peace offering, I bought us supper. Everything was fine when I went home for the weekend. 

When I came back, everything was a bit awkward at the house. Both A and X were there and I wasn't sure why everything was off but I didn't want to ask in case something had happened with A's boyfriend (who was also her ex, idk it was a weird situation) and it was sensitive. I did figure she'd tell me eventually, which may have been a mistake. The next day, X messaged me to ask if she could come to the house to talk to me (I didn't go to campus that day). When she got to the house, she asked me why I yelled at A the previous week about the spat we had with her studying. I was really confused and told her I didn't yell at her, I told X exactly what I said to her. X then proceeded to tell me that A told her that I called her a bitch and yelled at her and made her feel awful about the situation. I was really at such a loss for words. I didn't know how to approach the situation, and I didn't want to get X caught up in a broken telephone situation, so I kind of dropped it. Again, that was probably a huge mistake. 

Over the next few weeks, small things happened. It would be things like A saying to X that she wouldn't come to her new apartment if I was there, or just avoiding me with her life. This really started to piss off X since there was no obvious reason to be so rude to me. One incident happened where A wanted to go walk on the sports campus and tried to play it so that it looked like X didn't want to invite me and it would only be the two of them. Unlucky for her, I was with X when A tried to do that and so I saw all the messages. Another incident happened where A, X and I were eating supper together and A told X and I to stop being so loud (I have a habit of getting loud when I get excited and so does X). We were just talking about some random topic that made us laugh. After X left, A accused me of ""changing my personality when I'm around her"". I told her that I'm not loud around her because she basically always tells me to shut up, to which she said she doesn't like it when I'm loud. I don't know what she was trying to prove there. 

One day, X and I were having coffee and X said something along the lines of ""you're actually really smart, I don't know why A said you're stupid and not nearly as smart as you think"". I was really taken back by this and asked X what she meant. She basically told me that A was forever saying that I wasn't smart enough for the one major we shared in undergrad and I was forever needing her to tutor me. She also said something along the lines of my degree (or main major) being ""science for stupid people"" and ""it's too easy to be a real science"". I'm going to be honest, I was actually gutted that she said that. I confided in her about how useless I felt all the time and how I felt like I could never keep up with the rest of my class, and how scared I was that I wasn't going to get into postgrad. The icing on the cake was that I was always the one having to help her with studying, forever sharing my notes and explaining and re-explaining things to her. I never minded, I know what it's like to need help and to feel stupid. She would then also say things to the effect that my postgrad degree is too easy and I never do any work. This seriously angered me because I work my arse off in this degree. It's not easy by any means. 

There were so many small incidents. The one happened on a weekend I needed to stay there instead of going home. I had seen an outlet shop for a really popular brand and suggested we (A, X and I) go have a look. X and I both found stuff we liked and I got one or two things. A found this lingerie shirt thing that she really liked and wanted to get, but ultimately put it back. When we left the shop to go look at other shops, A showed me a picture she had taken wearing the lingerie thing in a fitting room, asking me (AND PLEASE NOTE THE QUESTION) ""would YOU wear this in public?"". I told her no because it was a bit too revealing for my comfort but if she wanted to then go for it. It looked cute. She wasn't pleased with my answer but that was that. When we went back to the car, X asked A if she wanted to go back and get that top. A replied ""no because (I) said she looked like a slut"". I spun around and, at the same time as X, said that I said no such thing and repeated what I actually said. A then just stormed to the car and got in. She drove us home and basically sped the entire way there. When we got back to the house, she said she was going back to get the top. X and I told her that we're meeting X's parents for lunch in literally 30 minutes and she didn't have time. X left to go meet her parents and after she left, I went to go ask A a question in her room. When I walked in, A was having a full-blown meltdown about how ugly her clothes are and how she just wanted to feel pretty and have nice clothes like X and I. I tried to reassure her that she did have nice clothes and that she wasn't ugly, but she wasn't having any of it. When we met up with X and her family (they took us to lunch to say thank you for having X while she dealt with her roommate situation), A just sat in the corner and sulked the entire time. She made everyone at the table very uncomfortable, she literally wouldn't say a word to anyone. 

Everything came to a head the day after that. We wanted to go watch a sports game our university team was playing in. I had bought tickets for A and I (I was really trying to make amends). X and I didn't have to go to campus that day so I went with her to her apartment and we sat and watched movies all day. At multiple points during the day, we both messaged A to ask what she wanted to do about getting ready and where to meet for the sports game. She either gave really vague answers or just didn't answer. At one point, she messaged X to say that she wasn't going to come and get ready at her apartment if I was there. When I say this was completely unprovoked, I mean it. One of X's friends messaged us to say that she wanted to go to a bar close to the sports grounds to have pre's. Please note, she messaged X literally 30 minutes before the time she suggested she wanted to be at this bar. X and I thought it would be fun so we said sure and IMMEDIATELY messaged A to tell her. We got no response. Anyway, we get to the bar and as we're ordering drinks, I hear A come up behind me and say ""thanks for telling me where you'd be"" in a really sarcastic tone. I told her that we did tell her where we'd be and that we'd just arrived too, she hadn't missed anything. I offered her a drink and she snapped back, saying that she could sort herself out. Now annoyed, X, her friend and I went to go sit with more of X's friends. A eventually comes out with a beer and literally downs the thing in 2 minutes flat and slams the bottle on the table, to which everyone stopped talking to look at her. X was already kind of drunk and I was nearing drunk too, so we both just carried on whatever stupid conversation we were having. A then went to get another beer, to which she downed in 2 minutes and also slammed on the table. The girl sitting next to me asked why A wouldn't sit down next to me (she just stood at the head of the table with her hand on her hip). A heard this and thumped down next to me. A couple minutes go by of X, her friends and I getting more and more drunk and talking more nonsense when all of a sudden A slams her hands on the table and says ""I'm not taking this anymore"". I spun around in my seat to ask what's wrong and, now SCREAMING at me, says that we're ignoring her and excluding her. I asked how we're doing that and she replied, still screaming, that we aren't inviting her to the conversation. Now being sick of being screamed at, I raised my voice and told her that she can't be expected to be invited to a conversation and to just join in, and that if she needed an invite to every conversation then she would never talk to anyone ever again. She looked like I slapped her and then ran out of the bar. When I turned back around, the entire bar had stopped to stare at us. I swear I have never felt so embarrassed in my life. I did message her later to ask what that was all about and she responded with the most half-arsed, spiteful messages, so I eventually gave up. When I got home, I heard she was still awake in her room but she didn't come out and I wasn't in the right mindset to go and confront her, so I just went to bed.

Because I needed to catch a lift with her to get to campus from the house, I needed to get up early the next morning to make sure she didn't leave without me. At one point, I wasn't sure if she was even going to campus (she was supposed to) so I messaged her to ask what's happening. She then came storming into the kitchen and told me ""I can give you a lift I suppose"". That was all she said to me that morning. She spent the entire car ride sighing and checking her watch. When we got to campus, I said bye and to have a nice day, which was ignored. The day goes by without a word until she was ready to leave. On the way home, she says ""I'll still give you a lift to campus even if we aren't friends"". No apology, just that. I will admit, I did kind of lose it then, I didn't scream or shout or anything but I was really blunt. I asked why we suddenly aren't friends anymore and asked her to stop being dramatic. I then also asked if she was going to apologise for how she spoke to me at the bar. The argument eventually escalated into me telling her how much she's been hurting me and treating me like crap with everything I said before this, to which she gave me a very forced apology and then rebutted it with things I had apparently done, most of which was X and I supposedly excluding her. I explained my side of that, and tried to tell her how often X and I did try to include her but she wasn't interested and instead sulked for the entire duration we were all together, which eventually led to X and I not bothering to try anymore. I did also bring up the fact that I'm allowed to have a friendship with X outside of my friendship with her, and that dynamics differ between friendships. She couldn't understand any of that and still gave an extremely half-hearted apology. Everything just got so much worse after that. She never confronted X about anything, and told her that I screamed and shouted and swore at her again. 

The next few weeks included her basically ignoring my existence. Car rides to campus in the morning and back home in the afternoon were dead silent and so incredibly awkward. She would basically kick me out of the car each morning, not even a second after parking the car. I don't have a car, so I depended on her entirely for transport. I literally felt like a prisoner. I started taking every opportunity I could to just stay home in my city so that I wouldn't have to put up with her behaviour. Things eventually got to a point where she alienated herself from our friend group completely, obviously blaming me. I'd often hear her having phone calls with her mom complaining about me and how difficult I am to live with, citing that I won't speak to her (???) being the only reason. She was still talking to X, who by this point was also fed up with her. She would make numerous attempts to talk shit about me with X, who would immediately shut it down and tell her to stop or put her in her place with what actually happened, which only aggravated A more. One day, as I was walking onto campus, I saw A and another one of her friends literally running away from me. I stopped and watched them because I was confused. They literally ran behind a generator hutch and watched me, giggling like 10 year olds, until they saw me staring at them, to which A gave me the ugliest look. I just shook my head and carried on walking. 

May was graduation season and our (A and I's) graduations were on different days (X is a year behind us so she hasn't graduated yet). None of my friends or A could make it to mine. I told X I was upset that I wouldn't have my friends there so she offered to come to mine. She took the most beautiful pictures for me and I was really so happy that she came. I obviously posted them everywhere, including the ones I took with X, which pissed off A so much so that she refused to have X at her graduation, saying that she can't come since she didn't ask A for the details to the event. This really hurt X. Before our graduations, we (my friend group) wanted to meet on campus to take pictures together since our ceremonies were all on different days. A refused to take any pictures with me, but is upset with me for not having any with her because I didn't ask apparently. She also tried to tell everyone that I ruined our other friends graduation by being controlling and taking all of his pictures. I do photography as a hobby, I was literally asked to take them. I asked said friend if I really ruined his graduation and he told me that I actually made it everything he wanted, which was a relief to hear. He was really upset to hear that she told everyone that I ruined it. 

Her newest exploit is telling everyone that I'm obsessed with her new situationship. I've known the guy for as long as she has, he's a good friend of mine but I definitely wouldn't date him. She's also told him that she's not looking for anything serious with him but then gushes over him to anyone that will listen (???) and gives him really mixed signals. The last two weeks I was living in that dungeon house, she spent every evening with him at his apartment until 10-11 p.m., meaning I had to take care of her dog. Makes me wonder what she would have done had I not been there to look after him, as in leaving him out in the cold with no food until that time. 

Since all of this, I've had to cancel my lease (which has turned out to be a blessing) due to financial trouble at home. A has since removed me from all her social media and is only communicating with me via her mom. I've messaged her numerous times asking what the issue is now and she hasn't even read the messages.  

I'm really scared I'm going to lose the rest of my friends over this whole thing. I've tried so many times to confide in them about what's been happening with A but they can't believe what I'm telling them since they've never experienced anything like this with her. This is also how I found out that A doesn't really speak to them anymore. 

If you read this far, thank you so much. If you're going to leave nasty comments, please just leave. I really need constructive and helpful advice right now.

I talked to the man for about 1-2 months and started dating. During the talking stage I never felt any bad feeling from him. He was like the dream bf any girl wud want, always listening, caring, attentive, and many more. He was very nice to me, and also to my sisters and almost felt too perfect apart from the fact he kinda looked gay (And no he is not gay neither do I have any probs with gay peeps). We started dating and soon enough I had to leave the country for my studies and started a long distance relationship. I got busy with the change and the shifting but ensured to give him time and effort. I might have lacked sm wer but then again I tried the best. 

He wanted a lil too much attention, but i didnt mind at first bcz I thought it will die down when he starts working too (he was on leave when we started dating). We talked when I had free time or breaks. Like I start my day at 6 and I call him then talk to him until breakfast, then off to uni, then reach uni again a round of call, classes, i call him at lunch break, then after class, at home, at night. Even if i dont call him, he calls me. From start I had mentioned that i like having me time and so whenever i asked like i cant and stuffs he was willingly leaving. Soon I started making friends at uni and this calling all through lunch breaks and other free time was cut down. He was not so happy about it but was understanding. By then he had started working and still the calls went on never decreased even a bit. 

By a month i was exhausted. Like i had nthng more to say at nyt other than to simply sit quietly. It was all nyc at first but became very exhausting especially when i had to be doing work and still keep calling him. I am sm1 who doesn't like too much affection or clingy nature, i like being let free to do my work, free from being contacted 52 times a day or reporting every single thing. Sm people may like it but i don't. My parents know this and for tht reason they dont call me more than once a day. And he knows this too. With this I started taking a step back. I started asking him to cut down the calling time, like i need to have a social life too. Its not that he was an introvert or anything he was a very social person, much more than me. But after starting the relationship his life revolved around me. And it kinda turned me off for the fact that he was letting go of the person he was, letting go of his likes, visions, dreams and everything. 

By month two, he was obsessed. When i say obsessed, i mean obsessed in such a way that u read in books. Every single thing i do, he remembers. Now u may think thats not bad. But its not like the usual sense. If i use a word, he starts using it too. I gave him a nickname, he wanted everyone to call him that, he literally changed his whole personality according to what I do. I say i like my coffee this way, he starts drinking his coffee that way, I say i like this sorta style, he changed his wadrobe the next day. I was moody one day and myt have said smthng or maybe smthng else and he just follows it for the rest of his life. That obsessive.

By month three, it was worse. If i say i feel like eating. No matter where, i am i get food deliveries, gifts delivered, and many more. This was an issue as i had not told my parents about dating as they had said strictly no dating. If said him to stop, he would send my friend money and make her buy it. And more than that she was pulled as well as one of his friend pulled into the relationship. Anything happens, he needs them as referees. They should tell me i should tell them, make him understand,  a whole ass scene was created everytime we fight. At times when i cant text or call he starts making my/his friend call me and make me reach him. And also we met twice during the time (he came to meet me). I was done, actually done. I said i wanted to break up, and everything blew up, he started going more insane. He started having panic attacks, temper issues, at once he even got suspended from his work. That level of bad though all the temper issues never was focused at me, i knew it was bcz of me. But i just couldnt do anything, i wanted a way out. I felt so surrounded, so shut, i wanted to break free. He wanted to just get back together and he would do anything and everything. 

He then went to meet my childhood friend, she was my bestfriend for a long time, though i havent officially connected them they both knew eachother. At first he texted her bf of whom he knew simply thru me telling him when i talk abt her, then her about everything, they wer kinda dumbstruck. He then asked to meet her and after quiet sm tym they met. He talked and talked abt he wants me bak in his life and all the other things that he carried with him, such as a lollipop stick that i ate,  my hair ties, the tissue i used and gave to him to throw away, im not even lying like literally, he had all those. She didnt know wht to say when she called me, she was literally baffled frm her core. The only questioned she asked was ""how did u date him?"". 

This is me writing this three yrs later, moved back home, the guys still here, still texts me, i ignored him for three yrs and now i let him text me, i couldnt care less, but I have no idea how to throw him out. I just want to make him stop. I thought meeting maybe good and i met him, oh boy it was bad, i think he fell head over heels again. I'm done. He even saved the plastic straw i used to drink my soda when we met. 

Please help me, i have tried blocking him several times. He has been stalking me relentlessly. I know he is stalking cuz i made a fake acc and he found it and asked me if it was me.

Yesterday I accidentally used up all the coffee milk, thinking I’ll just get some more at work tomorrow, didn’t realize it was part of her “routine” to have coffee everyday, so I didn’t think much of it. I checked my messages earlier and she said this to me about it? I would have felt bad about it had she not brought up the issue like this? I pointed out to her that the way communicated this was overly mean and that I don’t think something like this deserves this much crap at me and all she had to say to that was “I’m autistic”, and “be more accommodating and less dismissive of autistic needs”. This was actually pretty mellow compared to how she acts sometimes when stuff like this happens, but I’m just wondering how other autistic people view this? Am I wrong? I feel like her treatment of me is mean, and I get that she has emotional dysregulation but shes been like this every since I’ve known her, now I feel like she has a diagnosis she can just throw in my face when I call her out for it.

My wife and I booked the outbound flight to Paris from US in January which I understand is the slow season.  We live in upper midwest US so we're used to cold, anything above 0C is fine with us even outdoor as long as we can find places find a place to go to every hour or two (coffee, lunch, shopping mall etc)

**Traveler profiles:** Me and the wife are both 30-40 age group.  We mostly value scenry (landmarks, castles, etc). We're not big into art but we will do limited like Louvre in Paris and Von Gogh in Amsterdam.  Food is important to us.  The more ""local"" food we can find the better.  Even if it's a bit of a repeat, say if Belgium waffle and waffles in Netherland are different we wouldn't mind repeating.  Travel history wise: I've been to just a few European countries but not France/Belgium/Netherland.  Wife has never been to Europe at all.

  
**Itinerary:** The Paris leg is pretty much fixed, we'll spend 5 full days/nights in Paris, departing morning of the 6th day.  What I'm thinking about is to explore cities along the train route up to Amsterdam.  We plan on departing from Amsterdam back to US so it's a one-way route from Paris to Amsterdam.

I am thinking of two options for the 2nd half of the trip.

**Plan A**:  Brussels, Antwerp, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam

* **Brussels**: Given the limited size/things we'd enjoy, I plan on doing just 1 day/night there.  Will stay at one of the Marriotts in city center so everything should be either walkable or a short tram/subway ride.  Attractions like Grand Palace are the must-go's
* **Antwerp**: Similar to Brussels, I plan on 1 day/night.  Main focus will be the castles to the west of city center
* **Rotterdam**: This one I'm not so sure.  I understand Rotterdam unlike other cities were bombed during WW2 so it's ""modern"" which is actually less attractive to many tourists... is there any reason to stay a day/night there?
* **Amsterdam**: Wife wants 3 days but I was thinking 2 days is sufficient.  We'll hit up a few common places like Anna Frank house, maybe do some walks along the canals? Will definitely try their fries with mayo and the various types of sweets like stroopwafels.

**Plan B**: Brussels then Amsterdam.  Same # of days and itinerary for these two cities, so just skipping Antwerp and Rotterdam and cutting our trip short by 2 days.  The main reason to consider this is travel fatigue.  Is Plan B too much, especially in winter?

This feeling has been rapidly growing recently, to the point i feel like i don't deserve to give myself something good because i dont deserve a reward.

I havent been starving myself or anything, today i had coffee and a few chocolate wafer stick things (yesterday i ate more), if i were actually getting very hungry id eat, but basically my thought process when i'm drawing is:

""Damn im kinda a bit hungry id eat _."" -> ""But i don't actually need it because i'm not too hungry and also this fucking sucks. I will get something good to eat when i draw something good.""

But then i don't draw something good so i'm angry and upset and try until i'm too frustrated and my back hurts so i go calm down a bit but by that time it's late so i'm not hungry anymore anyway.

I've been trying to draw everyday and there has been moments where ive felt proud but it never last long and then i'm frustrated again. I don't want to take a break from art, i want to improve and get better. Art is the only thing ive ever put this much effort in and if i fail i will lose the one thing that i'm not bad at.

Because if you keep looking for other places to stay, the stress will end up eating youfrom inside out.

The first few weeks were normal. Boring.
Wake up.
Shower.
Put on the same shirt.
Coffee doesn't even taste like anything anymore.
Go to the big office in the big city.
Sit at my desk. Answer emails.
Smile when people walk by.
No one asks how I’m doing.

FaceTime with my girlfriend after work. She’s still in Maine.
""How’s the new place, love? Are you getting used to it?""
""It’s fine.""
""You sound tired.""
""Doing my best. Still can’t grasp the concept of office work.""
""Don’t burn yourself out, okay?""
""I’ll try.""

The apartment is small.
It’s cold, even in summer.
The walls don’t make any noise.
Which was weird for New York, I guess.
The smell of dust was getting heavier.

One day on my day off, I decided to clean the whole place.
Mopped the floors. Scrubbed every corner.
Got rid of all the dust.
For a while, the air felt better.

But then came the smell of rot.
I checked the fridge. Nothing rotten.
No leaks. No mold.
Then it went away.

At work, people started stepping back when I got in the elevator.
At lunch, Mark left a bottle of deodorant on my desk.
I asked him why.
He didn’t answer.
Just stared at the floor.

FaceTime again.
""Nick, you look pale.""
""Probably bad lighting. I feel fine.""
""Are you losing weight?""
""I don’t know. Don’t have a scale in here.""
""Do I look like I’m losing weight?""
She bit her lip.
""Do you go outside?""
""I go to work.""
""That’s not the same.""
I looked at the screen, but I couldn’t answer.
She started whimpering.
I think she was crying, but the Wi-Fi cut out before I could be sure.
 
That night, I saw it for the first time.
Long legs.
It was hunched over because the ceiling was too low.
It kind of looked like me trying to crawl near my bed—that damn incline near the roof floor.

I stared at it.
It stared at me with its white eyes.
I realized it had no feet.
Just floating an inch off the ground.
Neither of us moved.
I was too scared to move.
 
Got up at 4:12 AM I couldn't sleep.
The smell was gone. It was too.
But my toothbrush tasted like blood.
I checked my gums. They were fine.

At work, they stopped sitting near me.
In the break room, someone said:
""Smells like he’s rotting.""
I turned around, just to see them smiling at me.
 
FaceTime again.
""Nick?""
""Yeah?""
""Have you been sleeping?""
""I don’t think so.""
""Are you… Feeling alive?""
""I’m trying to be.""
She didn’t answer.
 
It got closer.
I could see it better.
Its arms… they were a part of its chest. Folded in... no stitched there or melted shut.
It was smiling.
But its eyes were terrified.
I drifted back to sleep.
I was used to it being there by then.
I woke up and it was by the bed.
Still smiling.
Still terrified.
It whispered:
""Rot suits you.""
 
I stopped showering.
I was feeling tired and I felt like it didn’t matter anymore.
My arms felt heavy.
Like they weren’t cooperating.
I practiced moving my fingers in front of the mirror.
They were slower.

After a few days, someone got fired at work.
It was my fault.
My mind was full. I don’t know what I was thinking. I remember it being like full static in my head.
I misplaced some files and someone took the blame for it.
I was sitting in the meeting room alone.
My manager knocked but didn’t come in.
""You doing okay, bud?""
I didn't answer just nodded even without looking at him
""Good.""
He left.
 
She called again.
""Nick, sniff your shirt.""
I laughed.
""Please.""
So I did.
Rot.
I smelled like death.
I gagged. Almost puked but managed to hold it in.
That was the first time I could smell it, really smell it.
She paused.
I tried to ask her, ""How did you know?""
But before I could finish, she said:
""I can smell it too.""
 
It stood by the bathroom door.
When I brushed my teeth, I saw it behind me.
Its voice was soft, like it was telling me a secret:
""You can't help.""
It was right.
 
I couldn’t lift my arms today.
They just hung there.
Like useless flaps of meat.
I opened my mouth in the mirror.
There was something behind my teeth.
 
They moved my desk away from everyone else. I thought ""im surely getting fired soon.""
Everyone gave me weird looks throught the day.
Mark walks by but doesn’t look at me.
I asked him how his day was.
He didn’t even answer.
Then he left.
 
I didn’t answer her call tonight.
She left a voicemail.
""I saw you in my sleep today.
You looked like you were smiling.
But your eyes weren’t.""
She told me to get out.
Take a break.
Call my parents.
Find a therapist.
But it was too late.
 
After hearing her message, I looked in the mirror.
My eyes were whiter and my pupils were gone.
Just like his.
And i was smiling. But i couldn't feel it.

I tried to pack my bag.
My fingers don’t close right anymore.
He appeared behind me while I tried.
His breath smelled like death.
""You .""
 
I don’t think this thing is a ghost.
I think it’s me.
Or at least, it’s what I am becoming.

I knew I was doing wrong.
I knew I was letting everything rot—my life, my job, my relationship.
I could’ve stopped. Even if people didn’t offer any help, I could’ve sought it.
I didn’t.
I kept going.

Now it’s closer than ever.
I decided, fuck my stuff, I just need to get out of here.
But I couldn’t leave.
I mean that literally.

When I reached for the door, the smell hit me so hard I puked.
My hands wouldn’t work right.
Then I fell down.
I heard my feet break.
When I looked down, all I saw was a pool of blood and thousands of bone shrapnel trying to escape my skin and muscle tissue.
But I don’t know if I can compare it to the pain of my teeth breaking from the inside out and rapidly rotting and cutting the insides of my mouth.
 
Nobody helps.
They see you breaking, and they look away.
That’s fair.
I would’ve done the same.
Back in Maine, my grandfather used to say:
""If you let rot sit long enough, it grows teeth.""
Now I know what he meant.
 
If you’re reading this, don’t bother messaging me.
I’m probably not here anymore.
Or if I am, I’m not leaving this apartment.
My fingers started to look like they’ve melted in acid while I’m typing this.
The screen is all bloody.
I can’t move my arms right.
But I feel like I had to post this.
All I want to say before I hit post or before I die is:
I’m sorry.
To myself.

Hi everyone,

I’ve been dealing with **overactive bladder (OAB)** for the past few months, and I’m looking for insights from others who’ve gone through the same.

I’m currently on **HRT (hormone replacement therapy) patch** and using **vaginal estrogen (Estragyn)**. I’ve noticed that the vaginal estrogen has helped *somewhat* — I used to wake up **4–5 times per night**, and now it's down to **1–2 times**, which is an improvement, but still disruptive to my sleep.

I’ve also:

* Stopped drinking coffee
* Cut off all fluid intake after 5:00 PM
* Tried improving my sleep habits (""sleep hygiene"")

Despite these efforts, I still wake up to urinate during the night. My GP told me this is ""just part of aging"" and that there’s nothing that can really be done — which was very frustrating to hear.

I’m reaching out here because I’d love to know:  
👉 For those of you dealing with overactive bladder, especially at night (nocturia), **what helped you**?  
👉 Are there medications, pelvic therapy, or lifestyle tweaks that actually worked?  
👉 Did anyone see a specialist like a urologist or pelvic floor physiotherapist who helped?

Thank you kindly for reading and for any responses you’re willing to share!",8,1752691896.0,Perimenopause,3,1.0,False

Okay Reddit, gather 'round, because I've stumbled upon something that's seriously streamlining my life, and I think it might help some of you too. I'm talking about the ""AI Voice Recorder: Easy Talk to Text"" – and let me tell you, the name doesn't lie.

I've always struggled with meetings and lectures. My brain just doesn't seem to want to cooperate with my hand when it comes to taking notes. I end up with half-finished sentences, random doodles, and a general feeling of ""what did I even learn?"" 😩

I tried the whole typing-on-a-laptop thing, but it's too distracting for me and others. I can't focus on what the speaker is saying if I'm trying to keep up with them. Plus, the keyboard clicks annoy everyone around me.

That's when I started looking into voice recorders. I tried a few basic ones, but the audio quality was always terrible, and transcribing the recordings was a nightmare. Hours of my life, gone!

Then, I found this AI Voice Recorder. The big selling point was the AI-powered voice-to-text transcription. I was skeptical, to be honest. I've been burned before by promises of ""accurate"" transcriptions. But I figured I'd give it a shot.

And wow, was I surprised. This thing actually works! I've used it in all sorts of situations: noisy coffee shops, brainstorming sessions with my team, even during phone calls. The transcription accuracy is seriously impressive. It even picks up my mumbling, which is a feat in itself.

It's small and portable, which is a huge plus. I can just slip it into my pocket and take it anywhere. It looks pretty sleek too, not gonna lie. But the real magic is the AI-powered voice-to-text. It captures everything, even when I'm speaking quickly or quietly. No more missed details, no more frantic scribbling. I can actually focus on what people are saying, which is a huge win for someone as easily distracted as I am.

One of the biggest benefits is the time saving. Transcribing used to eat up hours of my week. Now, I just upload the audio, and boom, instant text. I can search for keywords, copy and paste sections, and generally be way more efficient. I even used it to record a phone call with my insurance company (shhh!) and had a perfect record of everything that was said. 🤫

I'm also excited about the potential for this thing to integrate with AI models like ChatGPT. Imagine being able to summarize a whole meeting or ask questions about the content just by using the transcribed text. That's next-level stuff. I think this is the future of AI Recorders.

I was browsing ursupermart.com the other day and saw a similar item, but it lacked the AI integration this one has.

Here are some of the features I've found particularly useful:

*   **High Transcription Accuracy:** Seriously, this is the key. If the transcription is garbage, the whole thing is useless. This one nails it.
*   **Long Battery Life:** I can record for hours without worrying about it dying. Super important for long conferences or lectures.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Easy to export the text to Word, Google Docs, or whatever you use.

Honestly, this thing has been a game-changer for my productivity. I feel more organized, less stressed, and way more confident in my ability to capture and recall information. It's like having a super-powered personal assistant in my pocket. It is a great Transcription Device.

If you're someone who struggles with note-taking, spends too much time transcribing, or just wants to be more efficient, I highly recommend checking this out. It's not just a Voice Recorder; it's a productivity tool that can seriously improve your workflow.

I know what you’re thinking, this sounds too good to be true. I was skeptical too! But after using it for a few weeks, I’m a convert. It’s helped me in so many ways, from acing presentations to just remembering what my wife asked me to pick up at the store. 😅

Alright Reddit, lemme tell you about something that's seriously upped my productivity game. I've always been a terrible note-taker. I mean, my handwriting is so bad, even *I* can't read it half the time. Plus, I have the attention span of a goldfish. 🐠 Meetings? Forget about it. I'd leave with a page full of random doodles and zero actual information.

I've tried everything. Typing notes? Too slow, I can't keep up. Fancy pens that record audio? Cool in theory, but bulky and annoying to use. Just trying to focus really hard? Yeah, that lasted about five minutes. 😴

Then, I stumbled upon this AI Voice Recorder, and honestly, it's been a revelation. I'd call it a Smart Recorder.

The big selling point for me was the promise of accurate transcription. I've used voice recorders before, and the transcriptions were always a joke. Full of errors, missed words, and just plain gibberish. This thing? It's actually, shockingly good. I tested it in all sorts of situations: a noisy coffee shop, a rambling brainstorming session with my team, even during a phone call with my mom (love you, Mom, but you do tend to go off on tangents!). The results were seriously impressive.

It's a small, portable Digital Recorder, which is great because I can take it anywhere. Looks pretty sleek too, not gonna lie. But the real magic is the AI-powered voice-to-text. It captures everything, even my mumbling (which, trust me, is a challenge for any piece of technology). No more missed details, no more frantic scribbling.

Their range of espresso makers caters to various needs and skill levels, but choosing the best one can be tricky. Let me break down some of the top Breville espresso machines to help you find the perfect fit.

The Breville Barista Express is often considered the gold standard for home espresso machines. It's a semi-automatic machine that gives you control over the grinding and brewing process. What I love about this machine is its built-in grinder, which ensures you're always using freshly ground beans. The pressure gauge helps you dial in the perfect shot, and the steam wand allows for great milk frothing.

For those who want even more control, the Breville Dual Boiler is a step up. As the name suggests, it has separate boilers for brewing and steaming, allowing you to do both simultaneously. This machine is a bit pricier, but it's a favorite among espresso enthusiasts who want cafe-quality drinks at home.

On the other hand, if you're new to espresso making or prefer a more automated process, the Breville Bambino Plus might be your best bet. It's compact, easy to use, and still produces great espresso. The automatic milk frother is a nice touch for those who struggle with manual steaming.

For the tech-savvy coffee lovers, the Breville Oracle Touch is the cream of the crop. It's a fully automatic machine with a touchscreen interface that guides you through the process. While it's the most expensive option, it's perfect for those who want barista-quality drinks without the learning curve.

Regardless of which Breville machine you choose, proper maintenance is key to ensuring great espresso for years to come. Regular cleaning and descaling will keep your machine in top shape.

If you're ready to upgrade your coffee game, check out these Breville espresso machines and more at https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They have a great selection of not just Breville, but other top brands too.

Remember, the best espresso machine for you depends on your personal preferences, budget, and how much time you're willing to invest in learning the craft. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned barista, there's a Breville machine that can meet your needs.

I've been using a Breville machine for years now, and it's transformed my morning routine. There's nothing quite like starting the day with a perfect shot of espresso or a creamy latte made right in your kitchen. If you're on the fence about investing in an espresso machine, I'd say go for it. The money you'll save on cafe visits alone makes it worth it.

For those interested in exploring more options or comparing different models, you can find a comprehensive guide at https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They often have great deals and discounts too, so it's worth checking out.

In conclusion, while there's no one-size-fits-all answer to which Breville espresso machine is the best, understanding your needs and preferences will help you make the right choice. Whether you opt for the versatile Barista Express, the high-end Oracle Touch, or something in between, you're sure to elevate your coffee experience with a Breville machine.",1,1752691793.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

I work in a tech lab that me and my co-workers like to live in like vampires, but I like my plants. Not a single exterior window for hundreds of feet in any direction. I've managed to keep several plants alive in this environment for over a year and a half, but one vacation and some lazy co-workers not watering for me I lost them all. I recently got these 6 to replace the fallen. The LED strips are new and on a 12hr timer. The lights above run 24/7, there are two but one is being repaired.

Had sporadic failures in the past with leaf burn, root rot, and some crusty buildup after using decorative moss to cover the soil in an attempt to keep moisture in the soil. These mostly affected new plants, and older ones pushed through and were stable.

Please be brutally honest, what can I do better to help these guys thrive in the artificial environment? I water them weekly, and the ferns get spritzed daily. The larger plants get indoor plant food monthly or less. Thought about getting a mini desk humidifier to help fight the AC drying them out too quickly.

I am super wary of my allergies and do not ever expose myself to them. The last few days I’ve only eaten food I’ve made myself, so I know I haven’t had an exposure in my system at all. I’ve also been pretty constipated the last three or maybe four days because of the 5mg. (Gross, sorry, but super relevant lol) 

I woke up this morning with a swollen tongue and mouth, but couldn’t attributed anything to it so I figured I’d just eat my breakfast and have my coffee before taking a tiny dosage of benadryl.

There’s not much to do on weekends unless you want to sit at home or go out for food — and even that gets repetitive.

So we thought — what if we start something like a weekend hangout club? Very casual. Could be:

Watching a movie together (at someone’s house or wherever)

Catching a live match with a group

But every time I visit Bangalore, I’m amazed how much local memes and Reels influence how even locals talk about the city:
	•	The classic “silk board traffic” jokes that everyone shares (even if they don’t live near Silk Board).
	•	Reels about filter coffee vs Starbucks that feel like cultural debates.
	•	Videos that make Bangalore sound like an IT utopia… or a total mess.

Sometimes it feels like the city’s entire brand is being shaped online, for better or worse.

→ For Bangalore folks here:
	•	Do you feel local Instagram pages and memes represent the real city… or do they exaggerate things?
	•	Any pages or creators you love following for Bangalore content?
	•	Or anything that annoys you about how the city gets portrayed online?

Curious how others see it — especially people who’ve lived here longer.

(Not selling anything, just fascinated by how digital culture changes how we all talk about cities.)",3,1752691682.0,bangalore,3,1.0,False

Okay, let’s be real for a second. **Life is busy.** Between work, family, hobbies, and trying to squeeze in a little “me time,” it often feels like we’re just spinning our wheels. So, imagine this: what if you could magically **free up 5 hours each week**? 🙌 

Sounds dreamy, right? But here’s the kicker: you can only pick *one* task to automate. So, what’s it gonna be?

### Here are some brainwaves I had:

- **Meal Prep:** 🙈 Seriously, who enjoys spending Sunday afternoons chopping veggies and stirring pots? Imagine a world where a robot does all the prep and cooking while you kick back and binge-watch your favorite show. Plus, you’d be eating healthier. Win-win!

- **Email Management:** 📧 If you’re anything like me, drowning in a sea of emails, let’s be real—most of them don’t need your attention. What if an AI could sort through the noise, prioritizing what’s urgent and filtering out the junk? 

- **Workout Scheduling:** 🏋️‍♀️ How about a smart assistant that not only sets up your workout plan but also reminders you can’t ignore? Just think, you’d show up at the gym without even having to think about it.

- **Grocery Shopping:** 🛒 Picture this: you create a list once, and it magically reorders everything for you each week. No more forgetting items or doubling up on the same thing. Plus, **extra time for snack runs instead of stress runs!**

- **Cleaning:** 🧹 Love the idea of a Roomba whizzing around picking up dirt while you enjoy a cup of coffee? Sounds great, but let’s face it—wouldn’t it be awesome if it also did your laundry? *Now that’s next level!*

### Brainstorm Time!

What’s *your* pick? Is there a task you secretly *loathe* that you’d give away in a heartbeat? Picture how you would spend those newfound hours. Would you dive headfirst into a new hobby? Catch up on sleep? Or finally start that passion project you’ve been dreaming about? 

And let’s not forget to sprinkle in a bit of humor. 😂 Can you imagine automating the task of deciding what to watch on Netflix? That would save, like, 2 hours right there! 

Honestly, we all have tasks that drain our energy more than fuel our fire. So why not think about stepping into the future? Here’s to working smarter, not harder! 🌟

Depending on one’s relationship to coffee, one might not immediately associate the full flavors and aromatics of espresso with the idea of summer refreshment. But that’s the beauty of an espresso tonic. By combining the bolder elements of espresso with the tangy, tart, and bubbly sensations of tonic water, you end up with something uniquely refreshing: a fantastically balanced beverage that’s only further enhanced via the addition of something sweet and citrus-y, like orange juice. Sound intriguing? Give it a try for yourself with Trader Joe’s Sparkling Orange Flavored Espresso Tonic Beverage, a sublime little sipper that’s only available during the summer at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s. 

Best enjoyed chilled or over ice, Trader Joe’s Sparkling Orange Flavored Espresso Tonic Beverage is especially suited for serving as part of a summer weekend breakfast for brunch, preferably with some flaky pastry, a savory slice of avocado toast, or a cheesy omelet. And since each package comes with four 8-45 fl. oz cans, it’s great for grabbing when you’ve got folks coming over for a summer morning hangout. And while we’re on the topic of Espresso Tonic, we’d be remiss if we didn’t recommend accessorizing this Beverage with a lemon slice, orange twist, and a fresh sprig of rosemary or mint.

1m1kw1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m1kw1e/if_you_look_at_your_break_up_this_way_it_is_an/,"If you look at your break up this way, it is an absolute game changer to get you over your ex instantly …","A Different Way to Look at Breakups (That Actually Helped Me Let Go)

So I've been sitting with something lately that completely shifted the way I see breakups ~ and honestly, life itself. I want to share it in case it helps anyone else out there who's hurting.

We often take a breakup as the ultimate rejection. Like we weren’t enough. Like something is wrong with us. But here’s the truth I landed on recently ~ nothing lasts forever. Literally nothing.

Tell me one thing that truly, permanently lasts. Relationships, jobs, homes, feelings, even our bodies ~ all temporary. Even we are temporary. We don’t own anything. Not people. Not love. Not time. It all belongs to something far bigger than us. The universe lets us borrow experiences, connections, moments… and when it’s time, we have to give them back.

It’s not personal. If someone changes their mind about us, that’s not our fault. It’s just a sign that the story between us was ready to turn a page. Trying to hold onto something the universe is ready to let go of only creates more pain. I used to beg for things to go back to how they were. Now I remind myself ~ it’s not rejection, it’s redirection.

Let me give you an example.

My ex and I were together for nearly three years. I thought it was the real deal. But one day, he told me he just ""wasn’t feeling it anymore."" I spiralled. I replayed every conversation, tried to find out what I did wrong, obsessed over who he might be seeing now. I made it all about me. My worth. My failure. My rejection.

But then, something shifted. I was walking home one day and I looked up at a tree. The leaves were falling. It was beautiful ~ and temporary. That tree didn’t panic. It didn’t try to glue the leaves back on. It let go. Because that’s what nature does. It trusts the cycle.

I started trusting it too.

I found this book called [Bossing Your Gratitude](https://amzn.to/4esF8fP)(highly recommend ~ seriously, it changed my perspective). It helped me focus on what’s still here. What’s real and solid in my life right now ~ without him in it. I started writing down three things every morning that I do have. Some days it was simple stuff: my bed, my coffee, my sister’s stupid jokes. But it helped me anchor myself in the now. Not the past. Not the ""what ifs.""

Gratitude doesn’t erase the pain, but it does soften it. It makes you realise you were whole before him. You’re still whole now.

So if you’re reading this and feeling that gut-wrenching ache ~ just remember: this pain is temporary. You are not broken. You are just in the middle of a shift. Something new is coming, but only if you’re willing to unclench your fists and stop trying to hold onto what is already gone.

Let it go. Let it hurt. Let it teach you.

You don’t need to be chosen by someone else to be enough … You already are.

~

Would love to hear if anyone else has experienced this kind of perspective shift. What helped you finally let go?

Last week, I handled the grocery order myself and asked my partner what he needed. He said cereal and tea, and when I double-checked again, he confirmed that was everything. But when the groceries arrived, he was upset that I hadn’t included his coffee. Something we usually add to our order, but that he hadn’t mentioned this time. Eventually, he acknowledged that he hadn’t communicated it and admitted it was on him.

This week, I did the grocery order again while he was gaming—he responded when I had questions, and we planned to make tacos. Based on his feedback to include more vegetables in our dinners, I told him I was adding tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, lettuce, so we could have that for tacos. After a 10-hour workday that included commuting, folding laundry, and cooking red rice and taco meat from scratch, he said he was disappointed I hadn’t bought small/larger soft flour tortillas instead of using the regular size corn tortillas from the fridge. He said he wasn't mad. But he wished we were “on the same page,” and said I should’ve known that we’d need a larger base to hold all the ingredients.

I truly appreciate that he's expressing what he wants more clearly, but in both situations, I felt unrecognized for the effort I put in while managing everything on my own. It feels like the expectations keep shifting. AITA for not meeting my partner's needs/anticipating their needs?

The rest of the day has been nothing short of a bunch of very kind and sweet chaos.
I had to run some errands, even though I didn’t feel like it. I ran into the gas station, to get nicotine pouches, and the very kind cashier gave me one of the cans for free.  I then realized that I had forgotten my coffee. I ran back in, and all three cashiers at nearly the same time told me I could have it for free, after they had already given me a nicotine pouch can. 
Then I went to Walmart, and ended up spilling a little bit of my coffee. I went to ask someone for some paper towels, so I could clean it up, and they insisted on cleaning it up for me. I then ran into an acquaintance of mine that I hadn’t seen for a while at Walmart, And we got to catch up for a little bit.

It often emerges after the initial shock of the loss subsides and can be a powerful emotion as individuals redefine themselves and their future""

I'm finally so angry at my ex is could smush her face in. It's like a rage. I just want to punch or kick something.

I hate being angry. I hate how much I resent our happiness never being on the same plain. How could nature itself bring us together and yet your heart never aligned. It is another unfairness that has someone at the center of it.

I just have so much resentment towards the world. I want to release it. But...I can't. The past never releases me. I can't accept certain things. I'd rather die. Probably why I tried to kill myself over my friend for wanting to die. How much I honestly cut myself, punched things and sabotaged my friendships for years.

I'm angry no one ever recognizes me. That I'm always in the corner crying. That I'm always doing my best. Part of me still feels so alone. I'm not afraid to be seen. I'm afraid to be stabbed by what someone will learn. I want so desperately to be seen.

You saw me. And it made me feel loved. You saw who I was as a person. Someone saw my pain. But...when you became distant...I tried to pull you close. Over and over. And I stopped being seen as often. And my needs were being ignored.

Crumbled.

I'm angry I can't spend a morning making Vietnamese coffee with you. Or hanging on your arm. Or the joy of you doing the same. And I want to die knowing there's no more you. And angry. Why do I have to deal with it.

I thought about it a lot this week. You told me I could send as much as I wanted, then you said I was too much and blocked me.

I'm angry because I felt safe with you. I'm angry because the joy of you is such a danger. I loved you. That's why I'm angry. I loved you. I throw your ring into the water. And I'm glad it's gone.

But I'm ready to not be angry. You're not a threat. You don't hold a candle anymore. No smoke no fire.",1,1752691161.0,u_kay_anotheraccount,3,1.0,False

[Intro]
Hi, my name is Lucifer
From the Great Land
Aight? The wastelands, gansta


[Verse]
I don't bang if the cops ask, hey
I'm such a calm nice guy, 
 after a morning coffee downed

Loudest boy from the church quier (Whoa, whoa)
Opps up Glocks, but I up Bibles
When I bury blocks in Jesus' name
Ain't sayin' it in vein calm ya' tits
Revelations I recite while I fire blicks

Archangel Michael on my ass
In dark alley he almost caught me lack
 so lucky he accidentaly dropped his stake

Stake? Like a soldier, boy I got hit with PTSD 
 flashbacks
I immediately thought of gamble
 ran to this casino to hide 'til it's safe

I gave my left hand a scratch
 and told this lady she'll might have to open the 
 safe
I lowkey like her face, like
 imagine if she gave me head
Plus she looks like she fucks like crae

But I'on know if I got a chance, look
Last time I dropped a bit of semen on floor, like
 a drop, two, three or four
Okay, won't lie it was more


[Chorus]
Lemme show ya' da'
Art o' not givin' a fuck

Like, how to be hardest, harder than Die Hard
Harder than a video game from '99

Like, how to make a true fold like he 69
Like, how to put opps in check, 'ven if they
 claim they you blood? (Huh?)

When a crip'ple say he you bruh
 and you gotta slam the door of you life
In his face and say ""You ain' mine""
Like he a bad son (You ain't mine)

Caddilac I pull up in
Same way 'em shooters be

Get them skeeters, scooters outta here
Mr. Don't Give A Fuck for real


[Verse 2]
M Deezy, you ain't allowed to say ""faggot""
Like, ain't you see the news lately?
This sh*t is offensive and I fear you gettin' 
 canceled

Well, mayb' regards keepin' up I be lackin'
Seems one can lose focus (Uh huh)
Oh yeah, in camps that be concentration
 and, frankly, lately I ain't see anythin'
Like, I ain't even have the lights in this bitch

But I will have hella delight 
 while rollin' out this meat and greet
Both hands I might implement

I feel a spirit of a
Warm July in heart of mine

I'm being moved by that
Aspiration to cop that 'Gan
Utopia, ain't talkin' Lamb'

But a hit of pedal finna cause a hurricane
Foul mouth, cursin' out gods
 like a local drunk while I set a record lap, where?
On that Nürburgring, Green Hell
Like wifey if she had green hair

With right I grip the wheel
 while with left this tea I inhale

Got this bitty hella wet, no diss, no obese, but
 I'ma have her squirt like the whale
She seems to feel me like a blind man does Braille

Hit her up, like sup
Via email, yeah


[Chorus]
Lemme show ya' da'
Art o' not givin' a fuck

Like, how to be hardest, harder than Die Hard
Harder than a video game from '99

Like, how to make a true fold like he 69
Like, how to put opps in check, 'ven if they
 claim they you blood? (Huh?)

When a crip'ple say he you bruh
 and you gotta slam the door of you life
In his face and say ""You ain' mine""
Like he a bad son (You ain't mine)

Caddilac I pull up in
Same way 'em shooters be

Get them skeeters, scooters outta here
Mr. Don't Give A Fuck for real


[Verse 3]
In Hell end up I might, but if I
 end up in paradise
I'ma shoot craps in that ganster sec'
 while that one track plays (Which one?)
I ain't even gotta say its name

I'd prolly have to cool it off (Cool it off)
Cause when I fight ti stack my chips up
 I tend to swear alot, alot (Alot) (Evo je)
Been like that 'fore the age of 21 (Yeah)

Cookin' like Jimmy, fo' all day and night
Identity cris' got him thinkin' he Jesus
He might 'gin thinkin' he Cudi or sumn'
 the way I blew up his car, 'f that inbred in dress 
 (Fag)

On a side note, how am I, huh?
Feelin' to crae 'f and asylum (Brbrbr)

Crackie Chan from the block wanna be a stunt 
 man
No ONE-77, but I'm astonished (Hah)

In too deep in my ways, aye
Durin' the day I give Lord my praise
But at time of night I'm part of sect
Last time my ass almost got banned
 cause I was too late for a prayer
Like, fuck your Devil, I
 had to cop a pack of cigarettes

R.I.P to XXX, in my mind I carry that revenge, 
 no Garette
Yeah, bounda dig out their loved ones as well
Shit on their soil just so I know
 it don't sit well with 'em blokes, coin toss when 
 it's over


[Transition]
Whoa, whoa


[Verse 4]
I'on know when's the last time I done this
 four verse type shit, aight?
I'll make sure it pays off

Argh, argh (B) (B)
Ratata

Mr. Don't Give A Fuck (Prr) (Prr)
About anything (No)
Finna put on a show, that is for sure (Yo)
Look

M-D22, the gun I'ma make
Too toos might become my craft

'Bout this I don't play,
 this sh*t finn' even top the K (A)

All the way to the Z-Z, I
 got that love, them city ties
Like, why would I play around? (Why would I?)

I ain't talkin' ones of box, but
 it could place a fucka in one

Fresh to death, or dressed like a bum

 just to order decaff

I play it before work and as soon as i get home from the gym and on the weekend mornings i make my coffee and hop right on. I have alot of games but when URF is live its all i  can think about. It sounds horrible, and i was thinking to myself why this game mode is so addicting to me.

I've come to the conclusion that its because I played League through out high school and shortly after high school, for a bit i was very addicted to the regular game got very into it and into ranked and lore and i think that altered my brain chemistry, as i grew older i found less and less time to play the actual game.  And when URF is live its as if I can enjoy being a highschooler again where my only problem was some some measly homework. The short fast paced gamemode aligns with where i am in life currently but is very rewarding to the teenage individual within me who was just introduced to the game Freshman year of 2012, bright eyed and fresh to the game. I'm 26 now, full time job, value my physical health and gym frequently, have a girlfriend and need to pay rent and bills, have goals and aspirations, so you could imagine that playing the regular gamemode just doesnt hit the same as URF.",5,1752691087.0,Urf,1,1.0,False

We just moved into a new house and I’m totally stuck on how to lay out my living room and what kind of furniture to buy. I’d love some help thinking through the options. I’ve attached a photo of the space along with dimensions and would love any input or visuals if you’re up for it!

Details:

* The living room is open to the dining area and kitchen.
* I have a corner fireplace that makes the layout a bit tricky.
* Here are the dimensions of the walls:
   * Two walls on either side of the fireplace: **136 inches** each
   * Fireplace wall (angled corner): **75.5 inches**
   * Third wall (opposite the fireplace): **190 inches**
   * The fourth side opens directly to the **dining/kitchen area**, so no wall there. The dining table separates the living room from the kitchen
* I have young kids, no pets, and plan to host people regularly. My max budget is $6K for the entire living room - sofas/sectionals, accent chairs, coffee table, etc
* We still haven't decided if we want a TV in the living room

**Furniture Layout Options I'm Considering:**

**Option 1: Two Sofas in an L-Shape**

* One sofa along one of the walls next to the fireplace
* One sofa on the longer (190"") wall

**Option 2: Two Sofas Facing Each Other**

* One sofa on the wall next to the fireplace
* The other sofa directly across from it on the longer wall

**Option 3: L-Shaped Sectional Facing the Fireplace**

* Long side of sectional on the long wall (190"")
* Short side creates a visual divide with its back to the dining/kitchen

**Option 4: L-Shaped Sectional with Back to Fireplace Wall**

* Long side on the long wall (190"")
* Short side has its back against one of the fireplace-adjacent walls

**Questions I have**

* Which layout do you think makes the best use of space?
* Should I even bother with 2 sofas, or is a sectional the way to go?
* Any recommendations on where to buy furniture in the Midwest US? We want something that will standup for a while without breaking the bank.
* TV or no TV?

Genre: 2D Platformer
Estimated year of release: definitely before 2015 maybe even 2013
Graphics/Art style: Cartoony with fairly muted colors, at least for the main characters
Notable characters: The main characters (4 or 5) were different aliens (one was a warm desaturated purple, there may have also been green and orange) and I believe they fought against sweet foods?
Notable gameplay mechanics: I think you could shoot and each alien had their own special attack but I'm not entirely sure. I do remember you could collect cereal kinda like the rings in a sonic game
Other details: there may have been at least one part where you could jump over some stacked cups of coffee, I think one of the enemies may have been a green gummy bear and the attacks at least for one of the characters/levels looked like orange balls, it was probably a Friv game but I've been having trouble finding it in any list

I'm sorry if it's not detailed enough, I can try to make a drawing of what I remember if needed! thanks very much in advance <3 ",2,1752690782.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False
1m1kkij,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForteFoundation/comments/1m1kkij/networking_as_an_introvert/,Networking as an Introvert,"*If you are like me and find traditional networking both exhausting and overwhelming,* [this guide](https://www.fortefoundation.org/the-introverts-guide-to-networking/) *from Forté is for you.* 

# The Introvert’s Guide to Networking

# How to Build Meaningful Connections Without Leaving the House (or Putting on Shoes)

If the word *networking* makes you want to retreat under a blanket with a book, you’re in good company. For many high-achieving women, especially those who thrive in thoughtful, intentional spaces, the traditional “networking hustle” can feel draining, inauthentic, and overwhelming.

But here’s the good news: networking doesn’t have to be loud, exhausting or superficial. You can build deep, strategic, and energizing relationships on your terms. Whether you’re a student, emerging leader, or seasoned executive, your network can be a powerful force for growth, support, and impact—without requiring heels or happy hours.

Welcome to introvert-friendly networking, reimagined.

# 1. Redefine Networking as Relationship-Building

Let’s flip the narrative: Networking isn’t about selling yourself or collecting business cards—it’s about *forming connections with intention*. When you lead with authenticity, people will remember you for the right reasons. You don’t need to be the life of the party. You just need to be:

* Curious
* Consistent
* Yourself
* Real

# 2. Master the Art of the Digital Hello

Reaching out online doesn’t have to be impersonal, especially if you’re strategic.

* **LinkedIn is your playground:** If you’re making a new connection, be sure to include a thoughtful note about where you met or why you want to connect. An “I heard you speak at an event and was blown away – I’d love to know more about how you got  to your current role” can start a great conversation. Stay engaged with your current connections by commenting on their posts, sending a kind message, or sharing something insightful or interesting. 
* **Virtual coffee chats:** Try, “Would you be open to a 20-minute chat? I’d love to learn more about your path into X.” That phrase is pure magic.
* **Introverts love intros:** Ask for warm connections—and don’t be shy about offering them, too. A thoughtful introduction goes a long way.

# 3. Ask Questions That Matter

Small talk isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. And that’s okay. Try opening with questions that invite deeper answers. After all, meaningful conversations are more memorable than the weather.

* “What’s something you’re working on that’s energizing you?”
* “What led you to pursue this type of work?”
* “I enjoyed your recent session/post/video on \[topic\]. What inspired it?”

# 4. Prioritize the Right Connections

You don’t need hundreds of contacts. You need a handful of meaningful ones. Prioritize:

* People who challenge and encourage you
* People whose work genuinely inspires you
* People who share a common background, like a former employer or alma mater. That shared experience gives them a built-in sense of who you are.

Track conversations, follow up, and resist the urge to “do it all.” Strategic, consistent touchpoints win every time.

# 5. Create Your Own Connection Spaces

Not loving large-scale networking events, even virtual ones? You’re not alone. Consider:

* A 3-person Zoom on a shared topic
* A monthly “article club” with two like-minded peers
* A private Slack or WhatsApp group for supportive check-ins

You can start small and *build* community on your own terms.

# 6. Protect Your Energy Like It’s Your Favorite Charger

You don’t have to say yes to everything or everyone. Here’s how to stay connected without draining your battery:

* Schedule chats during your high-energy times
* Cap meetings at 30 minutes for focus and clarity
* Embrace JOMO (the joy of missing out) when something’s not right for you

Strategic boundaries are the key to sustainable growth.

# 7. Lead with Generosity and Purpose

Introverts are often great listeners, deep thinkers, and thoughtful supporters. Channel that into:

* Sharing jobs or opportunities tailored to someone’s goals
* Recommending a book, podcast, or article with a personal note
* Sending a quick “Thinking of you! Here’s something that reminded me of our chat”

Generosity makes you memorable in the best possible way.

You don’t have to be loud to be influential. You don’t have to go to every event to build a game-changing network. You just need to honor how you’re wired and let your strengths (thoughtfulness, curiosity, empathy) do the talking.

So throw on your softest sweater, grab a cup of tea, and reach out. Powerful connections await—and no shoes are required.

1m1kker,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1m1kker/confused_am_i_in_a_toxic_relationship_or_is/,Confused. Am I in a toxic relationship or is something wrong with me?,"Hi, I'm 35 female and live a fairly normal life. I had a rough childhood, but managed to stay on top and over the past 5 years things have been better, anxiety and depression aren't an unmanageable issue now. After failed traumatizing relationship with someone who had mental health issues, I finally thought I met my soulmate (32 male). We met at a party at work, because I work from home and started dating. He is from the US so there is the problem of a cultural difference as well, I think. Everything was going really well at first, he was very sweet, open, always complimented me and we had a great time together. He did mention his ex was a horrible manipulative person and their two year relationship was horrible for him.  I was looking to buy an apartment and he even came with me to see places. We even talked about getting a house in the mountains together. I said I really wanted kids and he said he would be open to it if we would have a nice house and good jobs. After like 3 months, he invited me on a ski trip with one of his female friends from the US and her boyfriend from here. Apparently they had a history of taking drugs and partying together. He said he is worried about them doing something weird but still invited me. On the trip, he was overly focused on the two of them and ignoring my needs. We always had to do what they wanted and he was acting parental to them and this started to bother me. Also he was paying more atention to her than me, and even mentioned that if things go down in the world, they discussed about buying a farmm together in the US. One night her boyfriend got drunk and said some mean things to me. My dream holiday was turning into a nightmare. Before we left I asked him about her, why they never dated and his reaction was aaaah with her?? noooo. I asked another time to get more clarification and he got upset that I am asking this about his female friends. On the way back, I was feeling ill with a bad cold and he drove all the way. I was using his phone to play music, and I saw that he still had dating apps installed. He said that he will delete them,  but days later they were still there, and when I confronted him he said he had forgoten to delete them and he deleted in front of me because I was upset, saying that this made him feel humiliated and my reaction was not ok. Because I was still ill, I was expecting to sleep at his place, but he asked like ""are you ok to be on your own tonight?"" I said yeah sure and he drove me home, where he kept asking if I'll be ok. I got upset and said that he's just asking to make himself feel better because clearly I was not ok, and he got upset and just left the apartment. The next day he apologized, cam over, said that he doesn't want to treat me like his ex and think I am pretending to be sick or in need for attention and that he loved me. He then proceeded to tell me stories of two of his exes who faked cancer to get his attention and lied about many things. The next morning, he mentioned a new colleague of his that has been going trough a rough time because her dad has cancer and she might have a gene, and she has to do some tests, and the doctor asked her if she wanted to have children. I found that to be weird but wasn't sure if I should say anything. Later I texted him saying that I find it strange and like oversharing, and if I have anything to be worried about. His behaviour changed completely and he became cold, distant and started to ask many questions, I ended up panicking and overexplaning myself and being very anxious as I could feel him pull away. The next day he showed up at my door with a bag of my stuff and broke up with me. 

Apparently he considered my message to be passive aggressive, and innapropriate to ask such a question about his poor colleague. I explained that because he told me about the stories with the two girls faking cancer just the night before, I got worried. After a few weeks I texted him to meet and give him his stuff, and we ended up talking again and meeting casually, and then I said I don't want to continue unless it's a relationship, and there we were back in a relationship, but he was being cold now and not very affectionate, also said he is sure he doesn't want kids anymore, and I was also reconsidering this because I feel like it would be too hard. He said he doesn't like to have conversations about our relationship or serious things, and I tried to respect that, although it made me feel very anxious and like walking on eggshells. He said we should only meet twice per week so he has time for his hobbies. We were doing things together and with our friends and gradually started spending more time together. He was supportive when I was sad because of other things, and even helped me move to the new apartment.  I tried to put gentle boundaries, like it felt one sided to me that I was always asking him via texts how his day was, saying good morning, and he wouldn't even say good morning back or ask me about my day and he was better with it after. The sex was always really good and I felt more comfortable trying new things, and getting even more sex toys. 

When I was away on holidays he said he missed me in the first day and was very warm and affectionate for like three days after I got back. Then we didn't meet all week but we had plans for the weekend. I called on Thursday to say that I miss him and wanted to hear his voice, thinking I should be more assertive about expressing my feelings, and he said he's in another call and he will call me after. But he never did, although he texted me. I asked him if the call was over and he said yes, and he's in bed now. I then asked if I misunderstood that we were supposed to have a call and he read the message but did not reply. I was hurt and upset so I called him, and said he forgot because he was tired and got upset because I accused him of leaving me on read, and that I trust technology too much and he didn't read the message but probably had the screen on because his phone sometimes does that. The message appeared as read 7 minutes after but I decided to let it go. I started crying and telling him all the things I was feeling and how I have to walk on eggshells, and then I had a meltdown and a panick attack and asked him to come over because I need him, and he laughed and said that if he comes over at 3 am he will be grumpy and unhappy with me the next day. He also said he doesn't miss me because we will see each other over the weekend anyways. The next day I was feeling very bad and could barely get out of bed but he didn't come, and a few days later he came over and broke up with me again because I accused him of things he didn't do, although he recognized that I was right with many things that I said. I wrote him a goodbye heartfelt letter after that he read and never replied to. 

I was devastated but didn't message or call him for two weeks, then he messaged about getting back his stuff. He messaged me on messanger not on wapp where we usually talk and where the letter was. He came and we talked and argued. He said he never loved me, he only loved his ex and he's not even sure about that because it could have been trauma bond. He said he doesn't love me anymore after the first breakup, so it hurt to know he never did. And then he left and two days later he said let's meet and talk like adults. We actually had a more honest conversation and he listened to how it made me feel and said he did love me but doesn't now and doesn't want to be with me. He seemed sad and at one point I kissed him and then we ended up having sex. While we were having sex he said this changes nothing, and then asked me if I would have gotten pregnant what I would have done, I said I would have probably keep it. Then he asked me, but you wouldn't do it on purpose, right? I said what no. It was very strange. We still saw each other after the breakups, and I kept hoping we could repair things. I even spent the night with him before he left for a 10-day trip—which I only found out wasn’t a guys' trip like I thought, but that his friends were bringing their girlfriends and he never invited me, even though we were still technically together when it was planned. That really hurt. After the first breakup, I tried hard to prove that I could be calm, understanding, and emotionally safe for him. I let a lot of things slide, including him shaming me for personal choices saying I've changed my personality after the first breakup (like saying I had changed because I wasn’t sure about wanting kids anymore, or because I liked anal sex now). He’d say things like, “I used to be nice but I can’t be anymore,” and blamed past relationships for why he couldn’t open up with me. 

A few days before he left for the trip we agreed to meet,  (he wanted to take his tv as well from my place after I agreed) and see how we feel and talk, but we just had sex and played a game and when I wanted to talk in the morning he got triggered and said he doesn'tt want to date me. I left crying, feeling humiliated that he just wanted his TV and sex. I got in the car in tears and he left, then I texted him that I feel humiliated and he felt bad seeing I couldn't drive and came back down in the car, and acted understanding that I felt used and said it wasn't just that, he wanted to see if it would be like before. He held me, and said let's talk over the next few days. Now he’s away, barely replying to my messages, even though he said he’d miss me. He leaves me on read and watches my stories although he in on the road between buses planes and probably has time to reply. He says we should “take a step back” and just get coffee when he gets back, but last night he wanted me to come over to see me and this morning I drove him to the bus and he said even if it's not easy he was glad I was with him and sat with him for the bus to arrive. However, after he stopped replying again I feel discarded, confused, and humiliated—like I was just useful company or emotional support, not someone he truly cares about. He said he won't message that much when he's there because he wants to disconnect, and probably the wi-fi will not be so good, although he told his boss he will work remotely for a few days.

I’ve tried to be understanding, kind, and emotionally available, but I’m drained. I don’t feel like I ever really mattered to him in the way I hoped. I’m not sure if I should go no contact, wait, or try to talk again and wait for him to get back. I still love him, but I’m starting to wonder if I’ve just been chasing breadcrumbs or maybe there is something wrong with me and I'm too sensitive. I've recently started to explore an autism diagnosis, and the initial tests indicate it could be something, and further testing is necessary. i've been told before I am very sensitive, and sometimes I get very sad over things that don't seem so important to others like the fact that I called him to say I miss you and try to connect and he forgot to call me back. I don't know why he is so distrusting, and thinks I am being manipulative and dishonest. I jsut feel so tired and I don't know what to do, how did I end up in this situation when everything was so amazing at first? Is this a toxic relationship or I'm just too weird and sensitive?",2,1752690769.0,ToxicRelationships,1,1.0,False

Thank you in advance for reading and sharing your insight with me. I've already started working on the operational processes, including name & entity documents (perhaps overkill, to be determined), and a tutoring agreement for clients/students to get my new tutoring business running for the 2025-2026 academic year. The purpose of this post is to ask for pricing help -- what to charge/extra for advanced coursework/lower rates to attract clients/etc.? My proposed rate would be $50/hour. (I'm having a hard time finding my *value* as a tutor, both with experience and other knowledge and mentorship I can provide. This might be very low, or maybe I'm delusional and charging way too much for a ""new"" business LOL). Thoughts?

**Background:**

\- BS in Mathematics, Spring 2022

\- MS in Applied Mathematics, Summer 2024

\- 4+ years of college-level tutoring experience: 3 yrs during UG and 1 yr as a Grad Assistant during my graduate program. All college students through work study, though some of my HS teachers contacted me to help their students over this time frame.

As of now, I'm limiting my scope to high school students (with 4 school districts in the surrounding area), either via remote or in-person sessions. Since my tutoring experiences are primarily at the college level, I would like to cater to the high school curriculum (algebra sequence, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics) -- including AP Calculus AB, BC, and AP Probability & Statistics (which I also took in high school). My areas of expertise are Calculus and Statistics -- that is what I've *studied* the most. In terms of tutoring, I would say that it has been mainly Business Calculus, Algebra, and other college courses not typically taught in a high school setting. If I find some success this year, I have also thought about offering SAT & ACT preparatory classes starting in the Spring/Summer of 2026.

I am located in a middle-class area, on the outskirts of a large city (15 minutes to downtown), with several shopping centers, coffee shops, and libraries -- many location options for in-person sessions. I have considered a travel differential -- an additional $10 / tutoring session hour + $2 for each additional mile in excess of 10 round-trip miles from my home. Too complicated?

There are also Kumon Learning and Mathnasium Tutoring Centers in my area, as well. I recognize that I'm competing with several very structured tutoring and academic businesses, on top of other local and community tutoring groups. How should I factor this into an hourly rate?

I'd like to think I have a solid foundation, but I value each of your opinions and thoughts. Plus, I'm sure there are many other factors I should also be considering, so any additional tricks, tips, *warnings,* etc. would be greatly appreciated.

1m1kijh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlumberReads/comments/1m1kijh/i_pulled_the_pin/,I pulled the pin.,"This morning, I pulled a tiny monitoring pin from my tooth — now, my wife is gone, and so is every trace of our life together.


I have to provide a tiny bit of context before I dive in; *stick with me.*
I'd lost both of my parents by high school graduation so when I was offered an out of state scholarship, I took it. Moved from Tennessee to Oklahoma and made real fast friends with the guy they roomed me with.


A week or two in, my friend let me know that he was about to earn $800 and get a free letter of recommendation for this clinical trial that he was gonna do. Well, I was broke and he also promised that this girl I had my eye on was taking part, too. I was obviously on board. 


It really wasn't even that memorable, the highlight was meeting *her.*
Lara was taking part in the trial too and we spent hours and hours in the waiting room sharing stories and getting close.
The only other memory I have of the trial was sitting for 2-3 hours once a week in a very grey room where I had to talk to a therapist type dude who asked a million questions covering every topic you can think of. 


If memory serves, I’m pretty sure that it had something to do with studying the processes that go into a person’s moral choices. It was purely therapist sessions, too. 
No needles or pills. It was easy. It was over after six weeks and my only symptoms at the end were a little extra pocket money and I’d grown completely attached to Lara. 


Other than using my small fortune to buy Lara a ring and a pretty white dress, nothing worth noting happened between finishing the trial and now. So, the real story starts about 3 weeks ago. 


On the second-to-last Friday in May, I got into an accident on my way home from work. Standard stuff, I got T-boned at an intersection, my car needed a new door and some internal stuff that insurance took care of but I was fine. Whiplash, but that comes with any accident.


Poor bastard in the car that hit me hadn't been wearing his seatbelt, though. Broke the windscreen with his own face. I saw the ambulance take him in a body bag. 


This is where I’m gonna lose you now and you’re gonna resign me to the cuckoos nest but please, stick with me. I'm not crazy. 


Three weeks later, we’re on the second Friday in June now, I'm on my way home from work in the shitty sedan my insurance set me up with while my car’s in the shop. 


Well, I'm honestly still a little on edge on this journey given the recent accident, I’m keeping an extra eye on the road and I get to the intersection where the poor dude T-boned me and I can see from my lane that *he* is fast approaching in the same car he died in three weeks ago. 


Hallucination? *Maybe, but it felt just as real as anything else.*


Just like last time, other drivers were honking and interacting with this dude ‘cos he’s moving way too fast for the speed limit and next thing I hear my radio tune out and then a voice. I know how this sounds. 


The radio said *“You don't have to make the same choice.”*


I don't know if I was subconsciously obeying the radio or if this would've been my course of action either way but I braked. Hard. He kept going and sped right past me this time, but he made sure his eyes met mine for just a second. It was him, it was his car. I don't know.


As soon as he was out of sight, the radio started up again like normal and I had to just make my way home. It shook me, but what can I do? How can I explain this to Lara? 

I didn't. 


I wouldn't be posting if it was just that, though. We’ll skip all of the boring shit in-between and I’ll cut to this morning.


I've been having some trouble with one of my teeth for a few weeks, the pain was sorta just my whole jaw for the first two weeks so I put it down to the accident at first. I did get whiplash and google told me that that could cause jaw pain so that was that for a while until then pain got more localised and it was clear that the issue was a specific tooth. 


I've been taking OTC’s and warming up Lara’s microwave heating pad and holding it to my jaw but this morning, I’d had enough. I know you're not meant to touch your teeth with your grubby digits especially when you think that there is a problem, so I hadn’t. Makes me feel kinda dumb now really. 


I took myself to the bathroom mirror about 8:30 this morning, washed my hands and got to work. It felt as if something foreign like a toothpick or a floss remnant had wedged itself somehow inside my tooth and after 4-5 minutes of yanking and scraping, I felt something cold hit my tongue. 


I spat it into my hand to see what had been bugging me and I was immediately confused. I’ve had 34 years on this planet, it's not too often that I come across something new. 


It looked like a pin, but it wasn't a pin.


I knew that I needed to find a way to inspect this tiny tooth inhabitant so I took a few photos with my phone to try and pick up the details that my eyes couldn’t. What I was holding did resemble a pin, the part that was directly inside my tooth was no thicker than a staple and no longer than an eyelash and it had a tiny round base that I assume was to keep it in place.



There was enamel residue on the base part, so I think that there was some kind of veneer adhesive or something ensuring it stayed stuck.
On the inside of the base was the only tangible clue, the letters **‘N.O.S’** had been engraved in tiny letters. 


So, I took to google. I tried a few searches like *‘N.O.S tooth pin’*, *‘N.O.S device’* but nothing yielded anything useful until I tried *‘N.O.S dental implant’.*


The A.I Overview at the top of the page said *“In some instances, the phrase ‘N.O.S Tooth Implant’ can be used to refer to the minuscule, pin-like devices used by psychologists to carry out Neural Observation Studies”.*


My eyes were pulled from the words I was trying to understand down to a search link result. It was *purple*, not blue, though. That usually means that my browser has accessed this page in the past, but I certainly had never seen it before. 


The search result was titled **‘Controversial Clinical Trial Shut Down In 2009 May Have Continued Without Consent’** and when I tell you that I've never clicked a link so fast in my life, I mean it. As the page loaded, I was already hovering my fingers over *‘command’* and *‘P’* on the keyboard so that I’d have a hard copy of whatever this was to look at, you've got to understand how quickly my paranoia was escalating in those moments. I'm not sure why, it just felt important. 


When it finally loaded, my eyes bounced from one disturbing keyword to another before settling on a line that read *‘…and even though the study was shut down due to the concerns surrounding ethical standards, evidence has come to light that suggest that a good number of the participants from the 2009 study are completely unaware that the clinical trial never came to a close.’.*


My brain rattled as it tried to process the words, nothing made sense. I have never pressed ‘print’ so fast. I don't know, I thought it might feel a little more real if I could hold it in my hands, you know?


I made my way to the printer to find that it had only printed the header of the newspaper it had been clipped from, that’s it.  None of the article content had printed so I switched back round to send it to print again. But, the article was gone. *Properly gone.*


I refreshed the page and got *404’d,* I pressed back and got a different error so I re-typed the google search to get it back that way and this time, google had no results. The A.I overview was gone. My search history? Completely intact *other* than the searches that pertained to what I'd found in my tooth. 


I was about to go and find Lara, I’d been spiralling for nearly an hour but as I looked up from my computer, there she was, stood, watching me from the doorway. 


“Ethan?” 


The homely warmth in her eyes, the singy-songy bounce in her voice that only comes out when she's talking to me, her signature hyper-energized sway while she stands, it was all gone. She looked like Lara, but she *felt* different. 
This thought seemingly fell straight out of my head, “Hey, babe. You seem…*off* this morning, everything alright?” 


What followed really did sound like her, the intonation in her voice was off, but she sounded otherwise just like my Lara, “Ethan, you look aghast. Can I get you anything?” 


Her voice was so flat. She sounded like an sub-par actor who hadn’t memorised her lines, I couldn't concentrate on her words. 


“Lara, I’m not sure what's going on. My tooth, I-” 


She cut me off, “Oh Ethan, you've done it, haven't you?”, a fleeting sigh being the only display of emotion from Lara so far, but even that felt inauthentic and weird.


It felt like a movie, I couldn't understand what was unfolding in front of me. I still don't understand. That's why I am here, I need someone to help me make sense of this.


The world seemed to cease for a brief moment and all I could hear was the subtle *click* that I knew to be my front door and I felt my morning coffee curdle in my gut.


I tried to stand at my desk but my leg muscles turned to spaghetti and I didn't have the strength, Lara didn't move a muscle. She didn't even flinch. The Lara I knew was apprehensive and jumpy at an unexpected knock at the door, her resolute stance in the doorway at this moment was more frightening to me than whatever I could hear now progressing up my staircase.


Now that I have a little bit of hindsight, I think I understand why the threat levels seemed so mismatched. Think of someone who you know really well. Someone you’re close to, your best friend, your brother, maybe *your* wife.

You know their routines, what they do and don’t like and you've seen them in enough situations to have a general idea of how they'll react in most circumstances; do you think you’d find it frightening if at a time when you were at your most vulnerable, they suddenly became cold, altered and unpredictable? 


As I opened my mouth to speak, two large men emerged from behind Lara with her still unaffected. My tongue dried up in an instant, I had no words. 


She moved now — just slightly forward to allow the two men into my office — her movement after so much standstill rekindled my adrenaline and mended the frayed wiring that connects my mouth to my brain. 


I managed two words, “done what?”


The men were now on either side of me, neither one of them speaking a word. I already knew I couldn’t fight them, for starters there were two of them but even if it were a fairer fight, my nervous system had already chosen ‘freeze’ rather than either of the more useful ‘fight’ or ‘flight’.


“Lara?” I sounded desperate. Like a fearful child seeking comfort from a parent. 


My growing panic and state of desperation made no impact on Lara. This wasn’t the Lara who was so overran with sympathy and compassion after my accident not long ago that she took two weeks off work and refused to leave my side for a moment because she was so concerned that I'd need her help and she wouldn't be there. This Lara was not that Lara.


Not *my* Lara.


My arms were restrained behind my back by one man as the other one retrieved something from an internal pocket in his jacket, this was all happening in my peripheral vision as I kept my gaze locked on Lara.


“I’ve done what?” 


My attention was pulled toward an intense piercing in my upper thigh that was imminently followed by a strange sort of disconnected warmth radiating through my body, my spaghetti muscles now a toxic blended sludge. 
My vision was trying to betray me but I put every ounce of my energy into focusing on Lara’s face,


“Oh Ethan.” Lara echoed the same performative sigh,


*”You’ve pulled the pin, haven't you?”*


That's the last thing I remember.
I woke up in my bed around 10:30pm.
No Lara. No men. No pin. All gone.
I've spent the last 3 hours tearing my house apart to find *any* scraps of Lara but there’s nothing. We’ve lived here *nine* years. 


There's nothing.


My phone is wrong. It *is* my phone but there’s no trace of Lara, no texts between us, no photos.

No Lara. 

Not only that, no *anyone*.

My contacts now consist of my barber, a couple restaurants and some old work contacts. 
No people, no friends, no Lara. 
My memory feels like one of those jigsaws that you might pick up second-hand at a charity shop — the kind that came to you without all of the pieces — the kind that you *never* had a chance to make whole. 
I don't know what to do.


I’m just so stuck on one thought. 
If I could re-do one thing in my life, I would *never* have pulled the pin.


I don't know who I am without her. I need answers. If anyone has any information about N.O.S, about the trial or similar trials, please reach out, *I need to remember.*

After someone else posted a tip on how you can boost extraction with a longer ratio (i.e. going from 1:16 to 1:18), I initially thought that doing so would result in weaker, more diluted coffee.  
  
After trying it for myself I actually realized I had it backwards (as the OP had explained) and that with more water you extract more since water is the solvent.  
  
So I had to try it for myself and I’m experiencing such a different cup. Where at first the S&W lychee coferment felt a little cramped in the cup and I struggled a bit getting acidity, now I can really pick out tasting notes and altogether I have a super tasty cup!  
  
I had to scale the grind back from 6 to 6.2 on Ode2, but I could go with more agitation and higher temp (93ºC) after some testing. Just a suggestion that if a coffee tastes somewhat bitter and you’re struggling to get flavor notes, try a longer ratio to get more out of it!",12,1752690619.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

1m1kfq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1m1kfq7/elvanse_too_inconsistent_dexamfetamine_only/,Elvanse too inconsistent; Dexamfetamine only slightly better. Thinking about Methylphenidate. Any advice?,"I’ve been on dexamfetamine for close to a year now (20/15/10 split dose) under NHS shared care. I’m thinking about asking my GP for a re-referral to trial a long-acting methylphenidate like Concerta XL or Medikinet XL. I’ve never tried methylphenidate before so I’ve got no idea how I’d respond. I’d love to hear from anyone who’s made the switch after trying dex or Elvanse.

Before dex I was on Elvanse and titrated all the way up to 70mg. The main issue for me was that it just never felt reliable. Some days it barely helped me focus at all; other days it would kick in but then fade too soon. Crashes were often also a problem even on lower doses, and left me feeling completely fried. 

I’ve followed all the usual advice about food, protein and timing doses with or without meals but it didn’t seem to make any meaningful difference. My diet’s pretty good most of the time; I take care of myself, supplement where needed, and all my bloods have been fine whenever checked. Overall, Elvanse was just too inconsistent and variable day-to-day for me.

Dex has definitely been better than Elvanse overall. It feels more consistent and the crashes aren’t as long or drawn out. That said, the peaks and troughs can still be jarring at times, and re-dosing multiple times in a day can often be inconvenient. 

Additionally, its efficacy can feel pretty hit or miss. I’ll plan out a whole routine but still find myself stuck doomscrolling or hyperfocusing on random stuff. It’s frustrating because it doesn’t feel like it’s fully doing the job. 

I’ve also found it sometimes makes me feel pissed off for no reason. I’m already someone who can get irritable at times even without meds, so having that dialled up isn’t ideal.

I’m not chasing a high or expecting some sort of magical fix. I just want something that actually helps me stay on top of things and manage my day without feeling all over the place.

I also tried bupropion for smoking cessation a few months ago, which worked surprisingly well alongside dex. It smoothed out the crashes and had a meaningful impact on my emotional regulation, rumination and overthinking. I often didn’t even notice when dex wore off because my head felt clearer overall. Sadly, my GP and NHS clinic won’t prescribe bupropion off-label for ADHD or mood, and going private isn’t feasible for me right now.

At the start of titration I wasn’t consuming any caffeine because I didn’t want it interfering. But as the meds started feeling less reliable, I found myself slipping back into daily coffees to try and make up for the slack. When I was on bupropion I didn’t need caffeine at all, but since stopping I’ve drifted back. Right now I’m only having one weak coffee in the mornings, but I’d rather not have to rely on it.

I’m drawn to the idea of once daily dosing and something smoother that lasts the whole day, but I’m worried methylphenidate might not last long enough. I’ve seen people say Concerta only lasts them six hours which puts me off, especially given my experience with Elvanse not lasting anywhere near its advertised 14 hours.

For anyone who has switched from Elvanse or dex to methylphenidate, how did it feel? Was it smoother and more consistent? Did it actually last the whole day or did you need a booster? Did it help with focus and task initiation or just make you feel more awake?


TL;DR: 

Dex has been better than Elvanse but still not ideal. Thinking about trying Concerta or Medikinet. Worried about how long MPH would last and if it would actually help with focus and executive function. Would love to hear your experiences.",2,1752690466.0,ADHDUK,2,1.0,False

The date was the 14th June 2025, I have been in contact with a girl who matched with me on hinge all due to me bringing up the fact I have a dog haha. We spent almost every day communicating, it flowed really well and we both laughed and asked questions like “do you believe in the multiverse theory” classic stuff you know. I eventually asked her out on a date to which she agreed, she eventually gave me her insta cause I wanted to show off my dog to her and from there we talked more. 

I had that feeling, you know that feeling that once you talk to a woman as the conversions flows super well you start imagining things and feeling things like “Oh she’s the one” that damn feeling that gets the better of us fellas. I believed she was the one, she outright said I was different than the guys she’s used to, I asked “in a good way or bad?” She replied “well I wouldn’t be talking to you if you were bad” my goofy ass couldn’t tell what can I say🤷🏽‍♂️. We had flirtatious back and forths, I was feeling so happy that my mind wasn’t so clouded with dread but with hope. We talked so much leading up to our date, she was so cute haha, she was having dilemmas about her outfit and “what if I trip” “I don’t know if I’ll be able to look at you”, I reassured her a lot about these worries tho. She asked me if this is my first hinge date, I told her it’s my first IRL date cause my previous relationship was ling distance so this is a whole new ball park for me, she told me this was her first hinge date too so you can imagine the excitement flowing through me lol.

And on the day of the date when I walked up to her she was stunning man, her pictures didn’t do her justice, she bought me a Lego rose set and I jokingly said “if I knew we were bringing gifts I would’ve brought you flowers!” She laughed and said “no no I just don’t enjoy receiving gifts I like buying for others though” we walked through the city and I took her to bowling where I booked for it, I essentially paid for the date (minus the coffee/milkshake she bought for us both) I then took her for ice cream and we both had a lovely time there, we ended up going to the park and just sitting on a bench and talked for a while. We even looked up and watched the clouds and started guessing what they looked like, that was the most fun I had in a while. 

We walked back into town and it was getting late so we both walked to her accommodation building where I stayed over for the night. We watched a show that I was surprised she watched (cause I loved the show) and we watched an episode and cuddled up with each other, I looked at her and in that moment I mustered up the courage to say to her “Can I be honest with you? Is it okay if I can kiss you?” She looked at me and smiled and said “yes” we both leaned in and we kissed, my legs were uncontrollably shaking at this point, very cartoonish lol, I asked her if she could sit on top of me and from there we just started making out. She tried giving me a hickey but I couldn’t have her do it cause my mum would kill me💀 in that moment when she was holding onto me and kissing me was the best moment of my life cause I saw that maybe I was desirable, but she man, she was something special. I ended up staying the night at her place (no we didn’t have sex before anyone says anything🫵🏽) she was holding onto me the entire night and I felt her locking my leg with hers and once again, in that moment when we were sleeping I believed that I was worth it finally, that someone finally sees me and wants me. 

The next morning she gave us both gum and we started making out again lol (I didn’t have a tooth brush so yikes) we grabbed some breakfast from the corner shop and had our tea, we both had a deep discussion about if we are taking things fast or not, I didn’t think so cause there was a mutual attraction that we couldn’t deny but I did tell her if she truly thinks that then we can take things slow. We spoke about our childhoods and how it has shaped us into who we are today, past relationships and her depression. I had to leave cause it was approaching mid day so she booked me an uber and I was gone not without giving her a final kiss, I was so happy in that uber man, I saw my future so bright and there was hope. I come home and I work on that Lego rose she gave me. I sent her a photo of it on my shelf and she loved it…..this is where things took a turn for the worse for us. 

Later that day she sent me a paragraph message detailing how she’s sorry for what she’s about to say but she can’t go forward with dating me cause of her issues that she has, believing if I stick around her I’ll be hurt but reassured me that I have been the most honest and most amazing guy she’s ever met, saying she doesn’t know why she made her dating profile in the first place when she knew she couldn’t commit or be present to someone knowing how damaged she is….

To say I was heart broken was/is an understatement, I was fighting back tears so hard typing away masking my actual feelings of heart ache and just wanting to convince her that we can work around it and we can make it work, I just couldn’t say it. I said “I’m fine and I hope you much happiness in the future and that I’m right here with you” I wanted so badly to tell her to meet me and we can talk it out that maybe she has cold feet idk literally anything to say that I’m not gonna be hurt but again, I couldn’t do it. You guys must be thinking I’m a bit selfish to have even thought about that. I was crying the entire day not wanting to talk to anyone, drowning myself in pity and sorrow, like the first time In a year I have found someone who, despite only talking to me because of my dog, she was someone who I could enjoy life with like I was so invested in this girl but maybe this is my curse and that despite being happy for 48 hours I’m not enough for anyone to stay longer. This whole thing reinforced the idea that I’m not as worth it and that I’m just not as loveable. It was a beautiful lie. 

I still talk to her and everything, her response time is just as bad as it was when we first chatted so nothing changed I suppose haha, I can’t deny anytime I talk to her I feel like I’m pulling her down with me and I’ve been saying to myself “what am I even doing” there’s a part of me that believes I have a chance with her yet, I’m afraid to send her that message.

I (28F) never cheat on him or post revealing selfies, I don’t reply to my DMs. Etc
However, he has cheated through out the whole relationship practically.
He’s cheated on me while I was pregnant with his child.
I left him for 9 months, he begged me to come back non stop so I did for the child’s sake of having a father.
Fast forward to now, it’s been 5 months since we’ve been back together.

He promised he’d heal me and what he’s put me through, but the whole 5 months he’s dismissed me every time I had an issue, invalidated every concern, made every one of my emotions about him, been a raging ass hole, lied to me about drinking and drug use all the time, said awful things to me about my past, consistently degraded and belittled me. So I eventually said fine, let’s just co parent if this is the relationship you have to offer me. 

He never agreed to that.
I tried to leave several times due to disrespect, drinking, drugs, etc but he begs me to stay every time I try to leave. Threatens to kill himself, etc.

But a day after the “co parenting” conversation, we went to an event on 4th of July as a family
He got an 18 year old girls number, texted her behind my back, and stopped replying after a few hours because he felt “guilty”.
He admitted it and apologized.
Great, but now the trust is broken. And it was never even rebuilt in the first place from being cheated on while pregnant.

It’s been two weeks since he cheated, he’s took me to dinner once, made some attempts to fix it like buying me coffee in the morning, writing me hand written notes, etc.

I explained I still don’t know if I wanna work it out or leave because I can’t trust him.
I asked if he’d be willing to put a parental guidance on his phone as porn has been a big issue and him lusting after other women obviously makes me insecure.
To which he brought up deleting my Instagram, saying it’s been years and I’ve never deleted it for him. He even said I was “micro cheating” because 4 months ago I prayed for a guy in DMs.
Literally just a prayer, no conversation.

I wouldn’t mind deleting it to help my relationship, but it’s the point that I’m doing it for a man who lies to me, has cheated on me, doesn’t offer any emotional security or support. How could I give to a man to make him more comfortable when I feel so betrayed and disgusted by his actions?

Do you think it’s valid for him to bring up deleting social media when I’m suggesting something that would make me feel more secure & help build trust?

1m1kb7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m1kb7z/what_makes_the_gaggia_velasca_prestige_the/,What makes the Gaggia Velasca Prestige the ultimate espresso machine? In-depth review!,"**Stylish Design and Compact Structure**  
I’ve been testing out the Gaggia RI8263/47 Velasca Prestige Espresso Machine for over a month now, and one of the first things I noticed was its sleek, stainless steel finish. It effortlessly adds a touch of modern elegance to my kitchen countertop. The low-profile design is another huge win—it slides conveniently under my cabinets without needing extra space, which is a rare find for espresso machines of this caliber. Its dimensions make it easy to maneuver, but don’t be fooled by the slim build; this machine doesn’t skimp on features.

**User-Friendly Interface and Programmability**  
Navigating the buttons on this fully automatic espresso machine was easier than I anticipated. Within minutes, I figured out how to program the drink settings to suit my preferences. With options to adjust beverage volume, milk content, strength, and even temperature, it felt like having my own barista on standby. A standout feature is the pre-infusion setting, a welcome touch that enhances flavor extraction. However, I recommend spending time with the manual or watching some tutorials online, as the machine's customization options can be slightly overwhelming at first.

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
This espresso machine works like a dream when it comes to making cappuccinos, espressos, and even baby cappuccinos. The one-touch brewing and frothing is ridiculously convenient; I’ve been spoiling myself with lusciously frothy drinks every morning. The ceramic burr grinder is another gem in the design, offering 10 fineness settings that cater to varying bean types. My test with medium-roast beans delivered consistently rich crema, and the aroma was divine. While the coffee itself is impressive, I’d suggest sticking to light or medium roast beans to prevent the grinder from clogging.

**Strengths**  
After using this espresso maker on a daily basis, here are some considerable advantages that stood out:  
- **Compact and stylish** stainless steel exterior perfect for small kitchens.  
- **Programmable features** give flexibility for personalized drinks.  
- Built-in **ceramic burr grinder** ensures fine, even grounds.  
- **Front-loading water tank** simplifies refills without moving the machine.  

**Maintenance Made Easy**  
Cleaning up after use has been refreshingly straightforward. The removable brew unit and automatic rinse options save time and energy. The machine even prompts you to descale when needed, which is particularly helpful. Regular maintenance, like using the cleaning tablets and decalcifying solutions, goes a long way. Trust me, you don’t want to skip this step; I learned that the hard way with a different machine I used previously, which broke down from a buildup of coffee oils and residues.

**Challenges**  
As much as I’ve enjoyed using this espresso maker, there are a few limitations worth calling out:  
- The **54oz water tank** needs frequent refilling if you’re a heavy coffee drinker like me.  
- It’s a bit **noisy** when grinding beans, especially in the morning when silence is appreciated.  
- The milk carafe, while convenient, can be tricky to clean thoroughly at times.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
When I compared the Velasca Prestige against competitors like the Breville Barista Express or the De'Longhi Dinamica, the differences were noticeable. The Breville machine offers more manual control, which is great if you like to experiment with shot timing and pressure, but it lacks the simplicity of one-touch frothing. The De’Longhi, on the other hand, features a larger water tank, which might be ideal for families but sacrifices countertop space. The Gaggia machine finds its niche in offering advanced programming without requiring significant space, making it a better fit for someone with limited kitchen real estate.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This espresso maker leans on the pricier side for home espresso machines, but its feature set makes it a strong contender in terms of value for money. Super-automatic espresso machines with similar specs often cost significantly more, yet they don't always match the Velasca's quality and convenience. While the investment may seem steep upfront, it's worth every penny for a daily coffee lover who enjoys quick customization without compromising on the drink's quality.

The past few months with this little gadget in my fridge have been...hydratingly eye-opening. The promise of removing up to 99% of contaminants seemed ambitious at first, but after putting it to the test, I realized there’s a lot to appreciate here—although it’s not without a few quirks.

**Ease of Installation and Design**  
Installing this water filter was surprisingly simple, even for someone like me who typically avoids anything remotely DIY (ahem, me). The ""push-to-lock-and-release"" feature does what it says on the box—literally. It slid right into place with minimal effort and securely locked in. The compact size, measuring only 9 inches in length, allowed it to comfortably fit inside my refrigerator. This design is tailored for convenience; just make sure it’s compatible with your fridge model. As it turns out, my own Frigidaire DGUS2635LP was ready to play nice.  

[Check Frigidaire WF3CB Puresource3 Refrigerator Water Filter price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0045llc7k/)  

**Performance That Speaks Volumes (or Gallons)**  
This water filter is rated for 200 gallons, and honestly, I didn’t track every single gallon I drank, but trust me, it handles weeks of hydration for a family. Water tastes crisp, fresh, and free from any odd chlorine-tinted flavor—it’s like bottled water poured straight from the faucet. What sealed the deal for me is its ability to filter out not just chlorine but also lead, mercury, pesticides, and even pharmaceuticals. Knowing it cuts down on such a wide spectrum of contaminants gives me peace of mind every time I fill up. Bonus points for anyone who's super picky about their coffee or tea—clean water makes a difference!

**Reliability for Long-Term Use**  
If you’ve been victim to “reminder light paranoia,” where you keep doubting whether your filter needs replacing, the indicator light feature will be your new best friend. A quick press and hold of the water filter button resets it, changing the display icon from red to green—a small but useful touch. Over the months, I never felt any noticeable drop in water flow or quality, which isn’t something you can take for granted with some cheaper alternatives.

**Advantages**  
- Crisp, clean-tasting water devoid of odd flavors.  
- Removes a wide variety of harmful contaminants, including chlorine and pharmaceuticals.  
- A straightforward installation process makes setup stress-free.  
- Compact size fits perfecly into compatible refrigerators.  

**Instances Where It Falls Short**  
- The price point might feel steep for a “little filter,” depending on your budget preferences.  
- Not all refrigerators out there are compatible, so double-check those model numbers!  

**Maintenance and Everyday Usability**  
The one area that feels slightly underwhelming is maintaining its indicator light. While most are reset by holding down a button, it doesn’t automate the process, so you’ll have to rely on memory or stick to a regular schedule. At least setting it up was easy enough to laugh about—I had my teenage niece reset it for fun, and she managed it without any issues. Oh, and note: it’s always worthwhile to keep a spare one on hand in case the current filter hits its expiration at an inconvenient time.

**Market Rivals**  
I’ve also tried alternatives like the ULTRAWF, which works for different Frigidaire models and is slightly larger. The ULTRAWF does offer comparable purification levels, but the size can be a hassle, especially if fridge space is already tight. Generic off-brand filters might save a couple of bucks but frequently disappoint with lower lifespan or worse, inconsistent filtration. Against competitors in the same range, the Frigidaire WF3CB feels like a balanced choice—reliable quality at a reasonable investment.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Speaking of investments, I had my reservations about whether this filter was worth the cost. After all, it’s a water filter—how hard can it be, right? Turns out, opting for a certified product like this not only made my water taste significantly better but also reduced how much I spent on bottled water over several months. Depending on how much filtered water your household consumes, it starts justifying itself in savings pretty quickly.

I’LL TALK ABOUT THAT NOW!!! (In points because lack of sleep is preventing me from stringing a cohesive paragraph together </3)

-Nevi’s mother was unfaithful to her husband—Kouneli— and so Nevi’s father is another man. 

-Nevi’s mother died while giving birth.

 -Kouneli found it odd that his kid was a demi-human and not an anthropomorphic like his wife and him.

-His wife’s infidelity was confirmed by his wife’s sister, and it was even more obvious Nevi wasn’t his when he saw his wife’s paramour at her funeral.

-Kouneli was hurt, obviously, but couldn’t bring himself to part ways with his new child since he still loved his late wife and Nevi was a part of her.

-As the years passed Kouneli couldn’t seem to fully love Nevi as his own. Any accomplishments Nevi would achieve would only be met with a hum or a dry “good job”.

-This made Nevi quite the people pleaser and overachiever, especially in their adulthood.

Have you noticed higher prices at your favorite local eateries or shops lately? You’re not alone! As California's minimum wage has continued to increase, there have been some noticeable impacts on businesses and services right here in Burbank.

Since Burbank follows the state minimum wage laws, which currently sits at $16.90 an hour, local businesses have had to adjust to these higher labor costs. This has led some small and independent businesses, which often operate on thin profit margins, to face significant challenges. Ever seen a menu price hike or a coffee that now costs a bit more? That’s partly due to these wage increases.

Not only are prices creeping up, but businesses might also be hiring fewer workers or cutting hours to manage costs better. Some cafes and restaurants might even replace staff with self-service kiosks to save on labor - which can affect job availability for those just starting in the workforce.

Moreover, small businesses are finding it tough as they balance rent, utilities, and now higher wages. This pressure can lead to fewer entry-level jobs, job losses, or even closures. It’s a tough cycle that can squeeze our local community, as many of us depend on these businesses while trying to afford basic living expenses in Burbank, which has a high cost of living already.

While these wage hikes aim to uplift lower-income workers, the reality on the ground can be more complicated. As we navigate these changes together, it’s important to consider how we can support local businesses and think about how our choices affect one another amidst these economic shifts.

What are your thoughts? Have you noticed these changes in your daily life around town? Let’s chat in the comments!

YouTube and socials are flooded with anti-gaming laptop hot takes:

“They overheat!”

“You pay a console premium for PC power!”

IMO the uprising hate is one of 3 things:

Clickbait culture: Outrage = views. If you bash gaming laptops, you’ll get clicks!

Affiliate bias: Some (almost ALL) creators push consoles or pre-built desktops with ""sweet"" referral deals.

Gatekeeping vibes: “Real gamers don’t game on laptops.” Heard it a million times.



Here’s the real value gaming laptops bring to the table (at least for me):

Portability: LAN parties, coffee shop vibes, couch-bed transitions desktops can NOT compete.

Space saving: Not everyone has room (or approval from dad/wife) for a full tower setup.

AIO convenience: Display, keyboard, mouse, camera, speakers, and battery backup all built in (cheaper!)

Hybrid use: Work, school, creative apps, then jump straight into Cyberpunk or RDR2 and without hauling multiple rigs.
