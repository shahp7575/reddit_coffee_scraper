1ipgxbf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ipgxbf,~12$ Big Bialetti boi needs a handle fix,"So, my mum's 6tz pot hooked me into moka pots, then I bought cheap 3tz for myself, and when i wanted to make much more tasty coffee for my family and wanted to buy 12tz i stumbled upon an auction for 18tz ex-display damaged Bialetti and i bid for the lolz...
And now somehow, i'm a proud owner of ~12$ 18tz Moka Express with broken handle.

Now the question is what would be the best method to repair it? 18tz replacement handle can't be bought anywhere. I thought about replacing it with available 12tz handle but it is smaller. Or, i'm overthinking all of this and just go and superglue it like it is now. I could also try to extract the pin, take the broken plastic part and glue it to the handle and reassemble it, but is it worth it? Will the glue hold the weight of fully loaded moka pot glued either way? What's your take on this?",1,1739556724.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

Very strong banana aroma after grind.

Green apples was the immediate dominant flavor (not one of the tasting notes but it really did taste like apple) with banana and caramel aftertaste. Once it cooled a bit the banana really took over with melon as well. Strong sweet aftertaste that lingered for a very long time. Really fun delicious coffee.

My husband and I have been together for 8 years, married 5. We have a young child. We both work 40 hours a week and I‚Äôm also a full time student. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm over reacting or not because I have a lot of built up resentment due to an uneven balance of household responsibilities so not sure if I‚Äôm just mad because of that and this is just something else or if he‚Äôs actually being selfish.

So the situation. I take our kid to childcare 3 days out of the week and my husband takes him 2 days. I was taking him the full work week but I finally broke down and asked him to please assist me with getting him where he needs to go so I can sleep in occasionally. I handle all overnight care and since I‚Äôve went back to school this just isn‚Äôt working for me. I once again asked him to please help me. Today (ofc it‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day) is my husband‚Äôs day to take him therefore I‚Äôm supposed to be able to sleep in a bit before I get up for work. We also have a thing that I started that whoever takes him in the morning sleeps all night and the other handles over night cause they can go back to sleep for an hour. But my husband ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù wake up to his alarm so can I please ‚Äúwake him up at 6‚Äù meaning I have to wake him up every day even if our child is screaming through the monitor. Anyways I did the overnight, then our son woke up at 5:30 saying he wanted to eat so I got him up. I went and woke my husband up then got my son some breakfast. After 10 minutes I went back into our room and he‚Äôs just sitting there. I‚Äôm like what are you doing?? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not 6.‚Äù Immediately I‚Äôm pissed. I just said well he‚Äôs awake now. I go back out. My husband comes back out and I go back to bed. Something happened and our kid is having a meltdown. I hear no comfort words and after 5-10 minutes I get up and just go hold my son until he calms down to tell me what happened. He wanted to help his dad feed the dog and dad did it without him (toddlers, iykyk). So they finally get out the door and it‚Äôs 6:47 and I have to be awake in 10 minutes to get ready for work and I didn‚Äôt get my sleep in. Idk the whole thing seems to selfish to me. It‚Äôs like this all the time. I left the house early to get myself a little coffee treat. Because on top of it all this morning my son and husband woke up to two valentine treats each from me and all I got was irritated. Not a ‚Äúhappy Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Äù and definitely no treat for me.

I‚Äôve recently started incorporating some supplements into my routine to support dopamine function, focus, and overall brain health. I know ADHD brains can react differently to supplements, so I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently taking:
	‚Ä¢	L-Tyrosine (500-1000 mg, morning on an empty stomach) ‚Äì Supports dopamine production.
	‚Ä¢	ALCAR (Acetyl-L-Carnitine) (500-1000 mg, morning on an empty stomach) ‚Äì May help with dopamine receptor sensitivity.
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium L-Threonate (200-400 mg, at night) ‚Äì Supports brain health and neurotransmitter function.
	‚Ä¢	Omega-3 (High DHA & EPA, 1000 mg total daily) ‚Äì Helps with dopamine receptor sensitivity and cognitive function.
	‚Ä¢	NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine) (600-1200 mg, morning) ‚Äì Reduces oxidative stress and supports neurotransmitter balance.
	‚Ä¢	L-Theanine (200-400 mg, with coffee or meds) ‚Äì Helps with anxiety and promotes a calm focus.

We soon started getting coffee together every morning and then having lunch together whenever we were in the office on the same day. At my job, we can work from home twice a week, and we happen to have the same at home and in persons workdays.

Over the past few months since last August, we‚Äôve become inseparable at work always talking, laughing, criticising and complaining about our jobs together. Even when we work from home, we call each other and stay on video calls most of the day, just chatting while working. After some time we also exchanged number and began to talk outside of work, during our respective holidays and basicly everyday.

I never wanted to be the guy at work who develops a crush on a colleague, but over time, I started having feelings for her. I didn‚Äôt say anything, I kept it to myself, pushed it down, and continued being a friend without thinking about it. I didn‚Äôt want to make things awkward (at work especially) or risk losing her as a friend.

But this past week, she confided in me that she has a crush on someone else. She explained that it's someone she's known for two years and that they are not officially together but he has confessed to her a years and half ago. She hasn't responded but now has a crush on him.

I know I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way, but it really stung, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it, about her and about what to do.

I‚Äôm lost. She has a crush on someone else, and I couldn‚Äôt help but develop one on her. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

1ipgit2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ipgit2/wife_26f_is_paranoid_about_me_32m_masturbating/,"Wife (26f) is paranoid about me (32m) masturbating, what to do?","It's going to be a long story but this is because it is a very complicated situation starting years ago and I think I need to explain a lot to paint a fair picture. However I try to keep it as short as possible:

My wife and I know each other for about 7 years, it started as a long distance relationship. We used to talk on facetime a lot and after seeing each other for couple of times and staying together, we decided to start a relationship. As we still lived apart, we kept on facetiming everyday for at least couple of hours. During this time, she would ask me to keep the facetime on even when I slept at nights (although the lights were off and she couldn't see anything). I thought it was weird but complied as it seemed very important to her. looking back it seems she wanted to make sure I sleep alone, but at the time I didn't think much of it. (this was the first sign of her being suspicious).

Fast forward a couple of years and after many staying togethers, she came to live with me in my hometown and away from her family. In the meantime we got married. The first year almost everything was fine. Although she would nag at me for hanging out with my (guy) friends. so I restricted my social gatherings. but still even when I went out with friends once a month we would have a huge fight. I kept thinking maybe its because she is away from her family and friends so I should be more sensitive about this. and for this reason I limited seeing my friends even further (to the point that at most I would see them every couple of months). I thought this is temporarily until she finds new friends here. And I was encouraging her to start school or work somewhere (even as volunteer) just to meet new people.

Fast forward another year, she started studying and working at the same time. and I was getting the impression that she is now settling down in the new town nicely and meeting new people, making friends and going out with them. I would still be very considerate of hanging out with my friends (just to emphasize, guy friends). but still I felt like we are going towards the right direction. I was hanging out with friends (even though it was still like once a month), I was studying myself, working on a great project, learning new languages, working out regularly. To me, it was going much better. And I was under the impression that she was also much happier seeing new people at work and school. Every now and then she would say something that would bother me (like asking questions about who was I talking to on the phone for work or being suspicious about whether I was indeed going to the office) but I shrugged it off as ""normal"" jealousy of girls.

However less than a year after she started working, the suspicions were getting out of control. She was accusing me of sleeping with other women and cheating on her. As I was so sure of myself, I would just tell her not to be crazy and try to give her some peace of mind by showing who I talked to on the phone and letting her check my messages and ...

During this period, she convinced me that couples should have each others passwords for mobile phone, laptop, bank account and more. So I gave her access to all of these. Every now and then I would catch her secretly looking through my phone but still as I was sure of myself I would just get mad at her for not trusting me but didn't make a big deal out of it. Still being almost daily accused of cheating and constantly feeling like walking on eggshells around her made me so sick that I stopped working out, stopped school, stopped my work for a while, and felt into a deep depression. Everything I had worked my entire life for was being destroyed. I lost my dream job and even my purpose in life. it was at this point that I found out its best if I consult a professional. So we went to therapy (both individually and as a couple).

We told almost everything to the couples counselor, it was a relief for me to talk to someone. She would tell us that it is wrong to invade each others privacy like this, so asked us to not share our passwords. Also she told me try not to defend yourself if you are being accused since this would normalize being accuse based on nothing. She even mentioned something like this is an issue known as parent and child pitfall; that the husband/wife would be treated like a child who is being controlled all the time and to avoid conflict would give in and play along. Furthermore she would say that the majority of issues stem from my wife's fears and insecurities and that she needed much more sessions than me.

It was during this period that my wife was also accusing me of masturbating daily. At the beginning I was denying it and trying to prove to her that I hadn't but after talking to the counselor, and she in turn talking to my wife for a couple of sessions, she asked us to try a different approach: every time she would accuse me of masturbating, I should say yes I did to make it a non-issue. This was since my wife was saying she wouldn't mind the act itself, just that she believed I was lying to her. Even though I wasn't lying to her, I would listen to the counselor and every time my wife asked me whether I masturbated I would say yes. Then she would ask with what, and I would say nothing but she would insist you can't masturbate with nothing and you must be seeing p..n online. Despite being accused on a daily basis and getting very bothered by this, I would trust the process of what the counselor was taking us. However every now and then I would cave in and let her search my phone when she accused me of cheating on her or let her search my laptop.

After like 15 sessions, during one of the sessions with the both of us, my wife got angry and told the counselor off; saying she doesn't know what she is talking about and not wanting to talk to her again and just walked away. To this day, I'm still not sure why, but that was the last time she talked to the counselor. the counselor that she herself found.

From this point it got even more crazy;

She kept accusing me with every chance she got. once saying that I smell like a women's perfume, then found out it was my own aftershave! another day accusing me of gifting my hat to a woman, then she found the hat under a pile of cloths in our closet. accusing me of talking to a woman behind her back, then found out it was my sister. accusing me of facetiming a woman and having the security camera footage of it from our home alarm system, which when we zoomed in saw it was actually the back of my phone that she got confused with a ""face"". and so many more.

She was developing this theory that I'm cheating on her with a (married) colleague and she crossed the line by contacting her from my phone. and she was not the only one (she contacted at least one other person but I don't know maybe even more). After I found out I wanted to do some damage control and call the colleague explaining that we are going through some rough times. But my wife said you want to talk to her to get your stories straight and I have to record my conversation with her if I want her to trust me; convincing me that this is the last thing I need to do to win her trust. I am ashamed to say that I fell for it and did in fact record our conversation. But when playing it back for my wife she again accused me of telling her what to say.

A few days later she kept calling that colleague so many times that her (my colleagues's) husband called me saying this is getting out of control. He talked to us both and ensured my wife there's nothing going on between his wife and me (very embarrassing situation). I even had to avoid working in the same building as my colleague due to the embarrassment that this brought me.

During this period, she shared all her thoughts and accusations with everyone around us; her family, our neighbors, her friends, even my parents. to the point that even my own parents doubted me and asked me whether there's something.

At this point I figured this is never getting better so I decided to get divorced. However she convinced me again that after so many attempt to ""catch"" me and finding out I wasn't lying she now trusts me. So again the gullible me believed her.

From this point on, the accusation of cheating stopped (also mainly because I was working largely from home as I tried to avoid seeing my colleagues because of all the embarrassments). However the accusations of masturbating was getting much much more.

Every time I touched a tissue, or I washed my hands, or I picked up my laptop or even if I was alone in a room for 5 minutes she would accuse me of masturbating. She would search the garbage for proof! (trying to find evidence). she would secretly record voice or take video when leaving the room or the house. She would even ask for sex whenever she suspected me to see whether I was able to have sex or I had just emptied myself! So much so that the daily sex was becoming a burden since I knew this is the reason. for a while she wouldn't leave the house before having sex with me and would ""demand"" it upon her arrival. And if I refused she would say then you've masturbated! So for me sex was losing its excitement as it was just a ""control instrument"" and nothing more.

To this day there are couple of days that everything is going good, as long as we would have daily sex but then after a couple of days suddenly she would act out. Just like today, we were both in the bed and she went to bring coffee, after returning (no more than 10 min), she accused me of masturbating while she was outside the room. Just because she heard me use the bathroom. and it turned into a huge fight.

At this point, I have no hope of situation improving. seems like every time I try to get my life back on track with my work, sport, mental health, ... she suddenly kicks me back into my depression. I have lost all hopes and purposes, some days I wouldn't even get out of bed and the worse part is I think she enjoys those days that I'm so beaten down.

I love her to death but can't continue like this. I feel like she's also hurting from all of whats happening inside her head but I've tried everything I could think of with no luck. I know that like 10 years ago she found out that her dad cheated on her mom so that probably plays a role but we've talked about this a lot (with the counselor, with each other, even her father talked to her saying he made a mistake back then and she shouldn't ruin her life because of that). Also her brother in law had a p..n addiction which caused some issues between him and her sister. So maybe that also plays a role. But after years of trying to help her out of these thoughts I now have completely given up. I even suspect her sisters/mothers or friends putting thoughts into her head.

Is there anything I can do? this has been going on for so long that  I'm completely lost and so tired of the entire situation that I feel like every time I look into the mirror I see a broken old man that I can hardly recognize anymore and with nothing to live for.

What's Going On:
Since late October/early November, my left eyelid has been twitching a few times an hour, throughout the day, every single day. It happens as early as right after I wake up and as late as when I'm laying in bed to sleep. There were no lifestyle changes at the time this started. After about a month of it, I asked my psychiatrist, who I have a virtual appointment with about every 6 weeks to check on medication/mood/overall function stuff and do renewals when needed. She said that she didn't think it was related to my medication and that it shouldn't be a concern and to keep an eye (no pun) on whether it continued or not or changed. It wasn't affecting anything else / I haven't had a medical emergency or anything, so I figured it is just something I have to deal with now. It has continued since that time, consistently, daily. 

Last week, I started also feeling the twitch in my right eye, as my left eyelid is twitching and possibly also right beneath my right eye/on my face there, but it's hard to tell. I have looked in the mirror and my phone camera while it is happening though and my right eyelid is not twitching visibily. I can feel it if I touch my finger to it though, so it is discernible that my eye or eyelid and/face is moving. It almost feels like shaking though? It's a little more subtle, a little less jerky (I don't know if that makes sense).

So I've made an appointment with my primary care doctor. I was trying to wait to ask at my annual in July, if nothing else had changed and it was still going on. But once I started ""feeling"" it in both eyes and under my eye, it's honestly really freaked me out. I know it shouldn't be distressing - I have random pains and other issues and I don't get bent out of shape about them. I just keep living my life. This issue is however really bothering me. 

What can I expect at my doctor's appointment? Will they tell me it's something benign and to wait and see longer if it goes away? What are the possibilities? I just want to be less surprised and more prepared.

I should have added that we don't do gag gifts in the past so my feelings were hurt by the passive aggressive meaning of the gift.

* Warning prompt about join clubs/hubs, and that no further verification is required to play them.

* Give me mod or Darwins inbox so I can clean up the waters in NA of the fisherman

1ipg4m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1ipg4m4/paroxetine_vs_clomipramine/,Paroxetine vs Clomipramine,"I suffer from OCD, depression, anxiety, also very low motivation as a consequence of my mental conditions. In my early 20's I was put on Paroxetine for social anxiety and it worked wonders...my OCD was not my main concern back then and paroxetine worked like a charm for my social and generalized anxiety. It also helped with OCD because this medicine gave me the ""I couldn't care less about anything"" mentality.

The bad thing was the lack of motivation, sleepiness and tiredness; and I was only on 20mg per day. 

Last year I quit paroxetine after many years on it and the withdrawal symptoms were very mild. I immediately felt more energized and motivated but also more anxious, which I could manage with a benzo. 

After a traumatic event I developed a strong OCD related to BDD and ever since my life has been hell. Everyday I keep ruminating about the same problem and every month I feel worse to the point I'm severely depressed and even suicidal (not actively trying to commit suicide but thinking about dying all the time). I'm visiting a psychiatrist and a psychologist. 

My psychiatrist offered my Clomipramine as an option, or an SSRI. I asked if Fluvoxamine was a good choice and my psychiatrist prescribed it to me. She also told I could be back on paroxetine if I trusted that medicine. I preferred fluvoxamine which is supposed to be better in terms of side effects. Started low on 50mg then bumped up to 100, 150, etc...till 250-300mg per day. 

I was very excited about starting Fluvoxamine after all the positive reviews I'd read. To be honest, months went by and I feel fluvoxamine effects are very mild and I need MUCH more help. It is true my anhedonia is way better on Fluvoxamine than it was on Paroxetine but the good effects are too mild.

I'm gonna tell my psychiatrist I need a different treatment. I think I'll be put on either Clomipramine or Paroxetine, or maybe I could ask for another SSRI like Escitalopram...(I don't want to try Fluoxetine or Sertraline because they can be too activating and also because they can reduce my appetite.)

Out of the two, which one would you pick? Paroxetine worked wonders and made me feel careless which is good when you are an anxious person. But it made me feel so tired and apathetic I barely did anything other than work and sleep. Drank lots of coffee yet felt unmotivated and sleepy...libido was ultra-low (same now on Fluvoxamine). Hope Clomipramine, which is known as the gold standard for OCD can be better than paroxetine in terms of energy, motivation, etc...but I'm also afraid of Clomi's cognitive side effects because of its anti-cholinergic activity.

I know clusters don't get worse with medication use, but I also have migraines so my neurologists don't want me to take Triptans or other pain pills on more than 9 days a month. I heard conflicting things, but it seems like high doses of caffeine (200-300mg a day) do give one rebound headaches.

  
Ideally I would like to chug a small can of Red Bull (80mg caffeine) for each attack, which can be up to 5 a day, every day, since my clusters are currently chronic. 

Do you guys have experiences with drinking large amounts of red bull regularily? 

Did you get rebound headaches? 

Do the energy drinks loose efficacy at some point and stop working or require larger and larger doses?

My uveitis doctor did mention i have very severe uveitis with even 15mg prednisolone not helping much. Can it be related?

 
I‚Äôve also had other symptoms like:
	‚Ä¢	Constant headaches (I also have post-concussion syndrome, but this feels worse)
	‚Ä¢	Issues with my vision feeling off 
	‚Ä¢	Joint discomfort/clicking in my ankles, wrists, neck, right shoulder, toes, and fingers
	‚Ä¢	General exercise intolerance
	‚Ä¢	Feeling like my brain is unstable or foggy

Doctors ruled out sarcoidosis, Beh√ßet‚Äôs, and MS (clear MRI, HRCT, and blood tests), but I feel worse than ever.

I know fatigue is common in autoimmune conditions, but is it normal for it to be this extreme? Could it be related to the uveitis itself, the steroids, or something else? If you‚Äôve dealt with this, how do you manage it?

Would really appreciate any insight. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind.

She had been my classmate from Class 6 to 12, and I had feelings for her since the beginning.

She asked for a lift as she was also heading to the city, and I agreed. As we rode, we talked about our school days, reminiscing about old times. I asked her what she was doing now, and she told me she was pursuing BTech in Engineering Physics at a prestigious NIT. When she asked about me, I told her I was doing graduation and preparing for the CDS exam.

Upon reaching the city, she requested me to drop her at a caf√©. I agreed. Once we reached, she invited me for a coffee, and I couldn‚Äôt refuse. Over coffee, we exchanged social media handles and contact numbers.

As I was about to leave, she stopped me. Opening her bag, she took out a rose, looked me in the eyes, and said, ""I know you have feelings for me. I feel the same way. Can we give this a try?""

I was paralyzed for a moment, still processing everything. But then, gathering myself, I said yes.

We spent the day talking and hanging out, lost in each other‚Äôs company. Everything felt perfect‚Äîuntil suddenly, she turned to me with a playful challenge.

""Since you're preparing for CDS, answer this‚ÄîWhich Article of the Indian Constitution is known as the Mini Constitution?""

I hesitated. I hadn't covered that part of my syllabus yet. Seeing my silence, she stared at me with disappointment. Then, at the end of the day, she said coldly, ""I don't want to be with someone who can't even answer such a simple question.""

And just like that, she left. She blocked me, erasing every trace of our day together.

I don‚Äôt want you to face such an embarrassing situation, so I‚Äôve compiled all the essential study material for NDA and CDS for you.

Ethan sat frozen in front of his laptop, staring at the list of names. The realization clawed at his sanity‚Äîthese weren‚Äôt just dreams. They were something more. Something real.

He tried to stay awake. Coffee, energy drinks, anything to keep his eyes open. But exhaustion was relentless. The moment his head dipped, darkness swallowed him.

The bus was waiting.

The same flickering lights. The same musty air. The same silent passengers, their hollow eyes fixed forward. But tonight, something was different.

The driver turned.

For the first time, Ethan saw its face‚Äîor the absence of one. A shifting void, rippling like black smoke, its hollow sockets locking onto him.

‚ÄúEthan Carter,‚Äù it rasped.

Terror crashed through him.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he gasped, gripping the seat. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt belong here!‚Äù

The bus lurched. The doors groaned open. Wind howled beyond the threshold, a gaping abyss stretching into nothingness.

A cold hand clamped onto his wrist.

Ethan screamed, thrashing, trying to break free. The other passengers turned, their mouths stretching open in silent agony, as if they wanted to warn him‚Äîbeg him to run.

Then, a whisper. Soft. Familiar.

‚ÄúWake up.‚Äù

A jolt of pain shot through his chest. His body convulsed.

And suddenly‚Äîhe was in a hospital bed. Machines beeping. A nurse shouting for help. His mother sobbing beside him.

He was awake.

But as he gasped for air, the weight on his wrist remained‚Äîan invisible grip, cold and unrelenting.

The nightmare wasn‚Äôt over. It had followed him back.

**Nightmares That Don‚Äôt End After Waking Up (Part 2)**

Ethan‚Äôs breath came in ragged gasps as he stared at his wrist. The cold sensation lingered, like fingers still wrapped around his skin. His mother clutched his other hand, sobbing with relief, but he barely registered her presence.

‚ÄúThe bus‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

His mother pulled back, her tear-streaked face twisting in confusion. ‚ÄúWhat did you say, sweetheart?‚Äù

Ethan swallowed hard, shaking his head. ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù

How could he explain? That his nightmares weren‚Äôt just dreams? That something had tried to take him back?

The doctors ran tests. His heart had nearly stopped in his sleep, but they found no cause. ""Residual trauma,"" they called it. ‚ÄúA psychological response to the coma.‚Äù They gave him sedatives. Told him to rest.

But Ethan knew better.

That night, as exhaustion dragged him under, he braced himself.

**The bus was waiting.**

This time, it was empty. No passengers. Just him and the driver.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù the void-faced figure rasped.

Ethan clenched his fists. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt choose to come back.‚Äù

The driver tilted its head. The bus doors creaked open.

Outside wasn‚Äôt darkness anymore. It was¬†**his hospital room.**

Ethan saw himself lying in bed, monitors beeping softly, his mother asleep in the chair beside him.

‚ÄúThis is your stop.‚Äù

He shook his head, stepping back. ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm alive.‚Äù

The driver‚Äôs hollow gaze bore into him. ‚Äú**For now.**‚Äù

The bus lurched, the walls vibrating with a deep, rumbling sound‚Äîlike distant thunder.

Then Ethan woke up.

But something was wrong.

The hospital was too quiet. The monitors were still, their lights off. He turned to his mother‚Äî**but she wasn‚Äôt moving.**

Panic surged through him. He grabbed her shoulder, shook her. ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù

No response.

Ethan scrambled out of bed, his chest tight with dread. The hallway beyond his room was pitch black. Shadows stretched unnaturally along the walls.

Then he heard it.

**A low, echoing horn in the distance.**

The bus was coming.

And this time, there was no waking up.",1,1739554265.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I was wondering what the lines or stains in my teeth could be caused by? I‚Äôve mentioned it to my hygienist and dentist before, and they typically ask if I drink soda, coffee, tea, or eat candy. Out of all of these, I‚Äôll drink herbal tea a handful of times in winter but that‚Äôs about it. 

I wear retainers every night and get dental cleanings twice a year. The stains? Are removed at every cleaning, but return within 2 months. Is there something else that could be causing them, or something that I could do to prevent it more? I‚Äôm trying to floss more regularly also. 

Additionally, is there anything I can do about the gum recession in my lower and upper canines? 

I was told to get an electronic toothbrush, so I‚Äôm saving up for that now, but was wondering if there was anything else I could do?


I have TMJ mostly under control, with a flare every few months. I take vitamin D supplements since I have a deficiency (as of a few months ago it‚Äôs actually in range for the first time, so I‚Äôm slowly reducing dosage to see how this year goes). I‚Äôm also taking Blisovi Fe (combination hormone medication) for suspected endometriosis.

I know I'm not the only one claiming a great marriage, but it is amazing. We share common tastes in entertainment and a strong Christian faith.

I could go on and on but this is why it works.

We took our time. We started as co workers. When we began dating, we went out to the movies, watched a band, went to an amusement park, watched some local races, just things we both enjoyed. When she invited me in for coffee, it was just that, coffee. We didn't rush into things. We didn't feel like we needed to get intimate after four dates, we didn't immediately move in together after a few months or force anything. 

I waited two years until I popped the question. We still maintained separate homes and did not live or sleep together until we got married. 

I think a lot of people rush into committed relationships, myself included. Those rarely work out and I know they did not for me.

Be patient. God has someone for you and He will bring you together, in His time, not yours.

For context, my husband and I go to the same church as this person and she‚Äôs in a leadership position, so she‚Äôs involved in multiple aspects of the church. We are also. So we‚Äôve been trying to navigate ways to peacefully coexist with her. 

She is very pushy and insists that we are friends when I do not know her and she has never taken the time to get to know me. We met for coffee early on and inevitably the topic of kids came up and I upfront told her my husband and I had a miscarriage at 8 weeks after our honeymoon. 

She responded with ‚ÄúMost people don‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre pregnant at 8 weeks‚Äù and said ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs what *everyone* kind of figured, that you guys couldn‚Äôt have kids‚Äù. 

Then proceeded to launch into a monologue about how traumatic her daughter‚Äôs birth was. Yes, the birth was traumatic. But she now has a very happy healthy little girl. 

Then she complained about how difficult it was for her to get pregnant and how they‚Äôre TTC.

Every month she has been sending me updates about how the test is negative. At first, I tried to put my own feelings aside and be kind and supportive, telling her to be gentle with herself. 

Now I‚Äôm starting to get very tired of this and the more I think about it, she‚Äôs been downright insensitive. 

To top it off, whenever I spend time with anyone else at our church or turn down an invite to go to their house (I try and avoid prolonged interactions with her as she talks only about herself and is very pushy and I find it exhausting) she will somehow find out about my plans and send me a message saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm jealous of your lunch plans‚Äù or she‚Äôll track down the person I‚Äôm meeting with and ask them jokingly ‚ÄúHow come you‚Äôre meeting (insert my name here) and not me for coffee?‚Äù. 

When she invites my husband and I over for dinner and I say I have plans already, she demands to know what the plans are and asks what my husband is doing. To appease her my husband went last time. We don‚Äôt want to deal with unnecessary drama if she doesn‚Äôt get her way and know she can make life difficult for us because she‚Äôs in church leadership-but I hate this because I know giving her what she wants reinforces the pushy behavior. 

Anyway, she will insist I‚Äôm one of her closest friends even though she knows nothing about me and we have gotten together a total of 3 times. And she will text me monthly updates about receiving another negative pregnancy test. 

It‚Äôs a long story, but for many reasons my husband and I can‚Äôt have kids and are currently trying to make our peace with opting to be childfree and maybe adopting a child later down the line. I don‚Äôt feel the need for our child if we have one to come from my own body, I understand some people do and that‚Äôs fine, for me I like the idea of giving a child that needs a home the love and care they deserve. It‚Äôs exciting to both my husband and I. Neither of us when we really think about it feels drawn to having biological kids. 

However, accepting that pregnancy is not an option for us and the miscarriage we had when we first got married 7 years ago has been difficult and we‚Äôre both feeling all sorts of things at the moment, especially stepping out of the typical Christian marriage ‚Äúmold‚Äù and not adhering to other‚Äôs expectations. 

It‚Äôs painful and I somehow feel like in many ways this woman is aware on some level that this is a pain point for me and this is something that satisfies her insecurities. I don‚Äôt know. 

She continues to text me monthly updates and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in a position to be her emotional support for this subject, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to be her friend. 

My husband is irritated with her and thinks she‚Äôs highly insensitive, rude, and overbearing. I am afraid of being rude to her and making waves, she is very gossipy and high drama. 

How to kindly communicate this? Would I be the asconaut if I told her I don‚Äôt feel comfortable discussing this with her and suggested she see a therapist instead? ",7,1739553542.0,dustythunder,14,0.82,False

During my lectures he‚Äôll usually sit a few rows infront of where I sit nearly every lecture, and then frequently turn his body around to glance at me or sorta turn his head to the side and like look at me through the corner of his eye? 

I feel really bad complaining about this, and I‚Äôve really been trying to give him the benefit of the doubt because I know he‚Äôs just taken an interest in me and of course it‚Äôs very nice of him to do so, but it‚Äôs just getting to a point where I‚Äôm kind of uncomfortable. 

What do you think I should do? Should I approach him? He may have like plausible deniability since he rarely approaches me, and I really don‚Äôt wanna make a big deal out of it or embarrass him, I just really want some space.

Last weekend I hooked up with a guy who I‚Äôd chatted too for the last 2 months , cancelled on him once but finally went through with it and hooked up at his place. 
OMG it was amazing! So many firsts.

My main concern was post but clarity.

Social media marketers say if you're not on social media, you'll never make it. They have entire teams of people making videos, carousel posts, SEO, blogs, etc, etc, etc.

But before the internet was part of our daily lives, plenty of businesses thrived. I didn't need to read a blog post about how they decaffeinate coffee to go to my local cafe. I didn't need Instagram to get me to go to my favorite hardware store. I didn't rely on Twitter to go to Target. If I needed a lawyer, I didn't need a Facebook ad telling me who to go to. I didn't need Instagram to tell me to go to a yoga class.

Stores, cafes, lawyers, yoga classes - they all existed before and did just fine. 

The internet and social media is just one giant ad. Why does every single business on the planet need to have ads everywhere? We get enough advertising from billboards, diner menus, television, streaming services, and radio. Its so frustrating when businesses goad you into following their social media pages by offering you a discount or something if you do.

They act like social media is the be all end all of business and that it's impossible to succeed without it.

I just don't understand. As someone in their 30s who is just completely burnt out from social media and no longer interested in participating, I'm wondering what people did before and why it's so obnoxious now. ",0,1739553324.0,NoStupidQuestions,8,0.4,False

I found my father‚Äôs pornography videotapes, and from time to time, I would steal them and watch. I masturbated to all the sexy video clips I saw on TV, and I would find films with sexy scenes and ""save"" them to masturbate to later. It was an escape from the hard feelings, as no one understood me. Then I started smoking, and over time, it became linked to masturbating‚ÄîI did both together. Later, I started smoking weed, and it became a ritual: I would smoke weed, watch porn, drink coffee, and smoke cigarettes all together. I could do this all day. Altogether, I think this addiction was stronger than heroin, and I felt like it was really killing me mentally and physically. I did everything I could to stop, but it was very difficult. I had no support, and I started to believe only in my own power. I made the first changes through small steps because I understood the power of small steps‚Äîgoing outside, doing a little exercise. Now, I‚Äôve quit everything‚Äîsmoking, porn, and all of it. It‚Äôs very difficult, but I understand that there is no other way to get closer to my dreams and goals.

I‚Äôve been working on a project called **ScriptChest**, a site where pen collectors and writing enthusiasts can log their pens, track ink usage, and analyze their writing habits over time. I just launched it a few days ago‚Äîmy first real *startup*!

I built this because, while there are plenty of tools for tracking books, watches, or even coffee habits, there wasn‚Äôt a great way for pen lovers to keep track of their collections in one place. And honestly, I just *love* my collection of pens and mechanical pencils.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts:

‚Ä¢ Does this sound like something you (or someone you know) would use?

‚Ä¢ What features would make a platform like this truly valuable?

‚Ä¢ Have you seen similar tools that you liked or disliked?

I added some photos to give a better idea of how it works. My biggest question: I know I‚Äôve hit a niche‚Äîone that I genuinely love and am obsessed with‚Äîbut after launching on Product Hunt, Uneed, and the relevant subreddits, what would *you* do next if you were me?

I know I didn't do everything to make this work and just recently reached out to microniche creators - but i can't help but think there's something staring me in the face where i could have improved on.

With the changes to the referral program the discounts have been reduced to 15% and you need to follow me and I need to follow you.

You can follow me from the link below.

I will confirm the follow request and follow back as soon as I can.

If a referral has reached its limit, let me know and I'll mark it as dead. I do not believe there is a way to get new referral links at the moment.

**Episode One: What is Reality**

John Mox hunched over his laptop in the crowded Starbucks on campus at Arizona State University. John was in his final semester of his graduate degree in Computer Science. fingers gliding over the keyboard like a pianist lost in a symphony. He was a skinny young man with short, silky curly blonde hair‚Äîwith the sides of his head shave in a buzz cut. The glow of the screen painted his sharp features, flickering light in his deep-set blue eyes. His half-melted iced coffee sat forgotten beside him, condensation pooling into a ring on the wooden table. The outside world had blurred into static noise‚Äîdistant murmurs of students, the hiss of the espresso machine, the rhythmic clatter of cups against saucers. None of it mattered. Only the code did.

But this wasn‚Äôt just a class assignment. This was something more. Something *alive*. The symbols on his screen pulsed in ways that defied logic, shifting between patterns he didn‚Äôt fully understand. His fingers hesitated for the first time all night. The glyphs from his dreams had found their way into his work again‚Äîancient symbols woven into the very language of the program. *Was he writing them? Or were they writing through him?*

Across from him, Elsa Nystr√∂m sighed, twirling a strand of platinum blonde hair around her manicured fingers. She had been watching him‚Äîwaiting, like a cat toying with its prey. ‚ÄúJohn, be a genius and help me with this, would you?‚Äù she asked, her voice feather-light with faux innocence.

John barely looked up. ‚ÄúI already told you, Elsa. I'll explain it, but I‚Äôm not just going to do it for you.‚Äù

Elsa‚Äôs lips curled into a small, knowing smirk. ‚ÄúRight, right. ‚ÄòTeaching a person to fish‚Äô and all that. But honestly, this stuff is impossible. And you, my dear John, should be in some top-secret government lab instead of wasting your time here.‚ÄùHe forced a chuckle, eyes flickering back to his screen. *If only she knew.*

Elsa leaned in, her perfume a mix of vanilla and something expensive. ‚ÄúCome on. Just this once?‚Äù

Before he could respond, another voice cut through the air. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt want to learn, John. She just wants to use you.‚Äù

John turned to see his younger sister, Ronni, standing at their table, arms crossed like an iron gate. She had the same sharp blue eyes, but hers burned with irritation. ‚ÄúWhy do you let people walk all over you?‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/z5oyt2o2x4je1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec58f9970c078464ffea2701069a2b2c5807c766

Elsa rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúOh great, the little sister police. Shouldn‚Äôt you be off doing... I don‚Äôt know, *kid* things?‚Äù

Ronni scoffed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nineteen, not nine. And unlike you, I don‚Äôt have to fake flirt or pretend to be nice to get what I want.‚Äù

John exhaled slowly. ‚ÄúRonni‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, John. Not this time.‚Äù Ronni jabbed a finger at Elsa. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs using you, and you *know* it.‚Äù

Elsa stood, brushing imaginary dust off her designer jeans. ‚ÄúWhatever. Have fun babysitting, John.‚Äù And with that, she turned her coke-bottle figure towards the door where her friends were waiting for her and sauntered off, her perfume lingering in the air like a ghost of something he‚Äôd never have.

Ronni plopped down smiling obnoxiously in Elsa‚Äôs vacant seat, glaring at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/ef6ydv27x4je1.jpg?width=1408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f090f71ddd0b06e1d871f87adfc598ae444239ea

John forced a laugh, but his gaze lingered on the door Elsa had disappeared through with her throng of jackals that she called friends. He should have felt relieved, but instead, there was an achy feeling of despair loitering in his chest, a quiet disappointment he couldn‚Äôt quite shake. Deep down, some part of him had wanted her to stay‚Äîto keep teasing him, to pretend for just a little longer that she actually cared. It was pathetic, and he knew it, but the feeling refused to leave him. But John prided himself on his principles and his logic, so above all else he refused to be used ungraciously.

https://preview.redd.it/k8k0dceax4je1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7895df58ecb1f701d92623d57594724e690b828

Ronni snapped her fingers in front of his face, breaking his trance. ""Snap out of it, John. She isn‚Äôt worth it.""

John barely registered her words. A sudden wave of dizziness slammed into him, turning the world into a distorted haze. His vision flickered, darkness and light warping at the edges. His breath hitched. His pulse thundered in his ears.

‚ÄúJohn?‚Äù Ronni‚Äôs voice was distant, muffled by the static roaring through his skull.

Heat crawled through his veins, an electric current igniting something *foreign* inside him. He gasped, gripping the table as his fingers trembled. A golden light bled into his vision, followed by violent swirls of violet, like galaxies collapsing behind his eyelids.

https://preview.redd.it/3xdkmx8ex4je1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=209399a670ce03abd68ab225b7acd5e1887c83ed

The lights in the Starbucks flickered wildly, casting eerie shadows across the caf√©. Then, without warning, the ground trembled beneath them‚Äîan earthquake-like vibration that sent cups rattling against saucers and startled gasps rippling through the crowd. Chairs scraped against the floor, and a barista dropped a ceramic mug, the shatter punctuating the moment like an exclamation of fear.

Then he saw it.

A shape‚Äîlooming, shifting, whispering. It wasn‚Äôt in the caf√©. It wasn‚Äôt even in this *reality.* It existed *behind* everything, watching, waiting.

‚ÄúJohn!‚Äù Ronni‚Äôs grip on his shoulders yanked him back, and he blinked hard. She gasped. ‚ÄúYour eyes‚Äî‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/gh9dy89gx4je1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=f039acf4211b0bacc48d42d43c60fc4064d3729a

He didn‚Äôt need a mirror to know what she saw. The opalescent glow in his irises pulsed like liquid fire, shifting between gold and bright violet. The caf√© lights flickered violently before steadying. Murmurs rippled through the room, but no one seemed to notice *him*‚Äîonly the strange momentary power surge.

John swallowed hard, his throat dry. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I just need some rest.‚Äù

Ronni hesitated. ‚ÄúJohn, this isn‚Äôt normal. Maybe we should‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI said I‚Äôm *fine*.‚Äù The steadiness in his voice surprised even him, but inside, panic twisted his gut into knots. He pushed to his feet, wavering for only a second before finding his balance. He had to get out of here.

The moment he stepped outside, the cool night air hit his skin, but it did nothing to calm the storm inside him. His hands wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking. The glow in his eyes hadn‚Äôt faded. And worst of all, he still *felt* it‚Äîsomething reaching for him, unseen but undeniable.

https://preview.redd.it/790rc18kx4je1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=9efbf1ab75006b23e69e6976493ba30879e5093b

John felt afraid, not knowing what was going on with him. Over the last year he had a number unexplained things happen to him, random electrical pulses shocking him while he entered and exited certain buildings, random feelings of deja vu during storms randomly, feelings of missing connections from those he had known.¬†

He couldn‚Äôt pinpoint what this essence actually was that was reaching out to him. Was it attacking him? Was it warming him? Did it want to stop him from doing certain things?

https://preview.redd.it/uptp0tunx4je1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=19dfd7723b46e77f560e485fbdc951f18d5120d4

These were all questions that permeated his thinking. The visions and thoughts were everywhere, his nightmares, his daydreams and now in the software he was building.

The glyphs weren‚Äôt just from his dreams.

They were calling him *back*. But where?

And somewhere, beyond the veil of reality, something else was waking up.

I think this is telling me I'm being not nice to my liver.  I don't know.  But, creatinine and everything else look good - GFR of 82, I'm 55 years old/male.  

First, APOLOGIES to this group.  Not a flex, but a concern for me of having GFR of 82 (this is normal apparently, but I am looking at determining long-term damage).  I was taking 10-12 supplements (turmeric, sterols, multi-vitamins, garlic, COQ10, Fish oils, Citrulline, Hawthorn berry extract, etc) and added black pepper to a concoction in the morning with olive oil, ginger, ground cloves, Cayenne Pepper, lemon juice, and honey.    Also, guilty of taking a ton of Splenda with black tea, green tea, coffee, arnold palmers (low-sugar lemonade).

So, I've read the case study on Turmeric and taking black pepper, as well as the case where the 65 year old woman on high dose turmeric died a month later without black pepper, but taking a boatload of supplements (not as many as me and lower dose Turmeric - I took 900 mg daily).    [Turmeric - LiverTox - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548561/)  (see Case 3. Fatal case of acute liver injury¬†).  This report doesn't talk about CKD, GFR, etc, so I'm curious.

Will my GFR get better by cutting out the supplements splenda, Black Tea, Green tea?  Or, is it more ""stop whining %@!@  - your score is fine for your age""

You have to have a degree of self-respect (self-loathing is bad, kids!) and at least try to be conscious of your personal health and hygiene. On the flip side, if it takes you more than 15 minutes to get ready because you're caking on eyeliner and mouthliner and whatever other kind of liner they make just to impress me then I'll probably get tired of waiting around for you and take myself to a barcade instead.

>In social settings I am extroverted, confident and charming. I love talking to people but also appreciate some quite time to destress at home. I enjoy dark humor and let my silly/cute side show when at home with someone I love. I am adventurous and open minded and never truly have enough time for all of the fun things to try on my list. I enjoy playing the violin or piano, snowboarding, traveling, board game nights, the occasional glass of wine or cocktail and more.

>When it comes to spicier stuff I enjoy taking charge and being in control.

>What I'm looking for: As ironic as it sounds I am looking for a ""monogomous"" AP (for health and sanity reasons lol).

Zachary Marie is VERY overwhelmed that his friends have V-Day plans that don't involve him.  Zach says he's nervous about this weekend because this is the first time in a long time that he doesn't have plans with friends.  He says two of his friends are going out of town this weekend, and that they've always been reliable as a back up plan for him to come over last minute if he doesn't have other plans.  I'm assuming this is Anna and Diego, who he has mentioned several times - they are the infamous couple with the Netflix account where Zach couch rots for hours.  

Honestly it bothers me how he talks about these friends.  Like how dare this couple go away for Valentine's Day weekend when Zachary Michael will be left alone with no free Netflix to watch!!  The way he talks about these friendships is so self-serving.  I wonder how they feel about being Zach's backup plan every weekend.  Zach doesn't seem to care about their lives, he literally just doesn't want to be alone (or pay for his own Netflix account!) 

He said he's considering going to a coffee shop this weekend to read a book alone, but he says he thinks that's lame.  He says he needs human interaction, and then he talks about how much more socially fulfilled he was in his job in higher ed when he interacted with students regularly.  Bestie, maybe that's your sign to get a job or get involved in your community and not just rely on your ""friends"" for couch rotting all the time. 

Someone in the twitch chat says Zach should read some of Amberlynn's book recommendations, and Zach says that he has plenty of books of his own.  But then he goes on a rant about how people think it's a bad thing to have things in common with Amberlynn or to do the same stuff as her, but that it's actually totally okay to be just like Amberlynn!  

He also started going to an art class, where he wore his own merch (a sweatshirt with his own face on it) and introduced himself to everyone as a YouTuber, but nobody asked him any follow up questions about it.  I'm shocked nobody recognized him and there were no Zachary Michael fans in the class!   He also posted some of his drawings on his Instagram and thinks his followers should be super impressed by them.  It's giving ALR sharing her scratch art.  He was also super thrown off because the class was at 10 a.m. and he had to set an alarm in the morning to get there on time and he said it really threw him off for the rest of the day.  Poor Zachary Marie!  

Oh, and at one point he tells his Twitch chat that they're ""brain rotted"" because they keep repeating the same phrases and jokes over and over.  Erm, yeah, DIVA, this is the kind of community you've created.  I swear he deeply loathes the people that are obsessed with him on Twitch. üòÇ",40,1739551467.0,ZacharyMichaelSnark,25,0.99,False

Nothing special just a dinner with my husband. I also asked him if he is okay to go at that restaurant and he didn‚Äôt say anything and said okay whatever I feel. I even called restaurant for reservation and they said that for today its drop in only. I told him and he said well I don‚Äôt wanna go because of rush. And I suggested we could go early to grab a table. And then we can roam around. But then he started I don‚Äôt wanna go to this restaurant I don‚Äôt like food then I asked which restaurant you wanna go and for each restaurant he is like oh I can go with you but you can eat and I can just either sit with you or just order small appetiser if I like but I am not really looking forward to eat. And then he pointed out that we eat out every now and then too (which basically buying a salad from a grocery store from a salad counter). We have stopped going out on any restaurant since last year because he keeps complaining about every place we go. To the point that I now only go out with my colleagues and friends. And I ditch going out with him at all. Every coffee shop every place we go he just complains. It‚Äôs not India and of course we won‚Äôt find the same vibe here. So we have to adjust based on what we have. We both don‚Äôt drink alcohol now so no pubs either. Everywhere I plan he just puts so many conditions and complaints that I have completely stopped planning with him. When it comes to trips we always plan around his comfort and if I ask that I want to visit certain places he says you do your boring stuff count me out. At this point feels like I can‚Äôt even go anywhere with him except for buying groceries that too he complaints about sometimes. We are expecting a baby this year and I was hoping we could spend as much time we get together and even go out more before we get busy with the baby. Is it too much of the ask? Just going out for one evening? We both earn a decent money and I feel like we could go out sometimes and have fun together also. It‚Äôs just sad that for any fun I have to go out with my colleagues only. We are both in our 30s and within 4 years our relationship has reached like we are in 80s. Even my parents go out together every now and then. I feel so depressed today. He is a very nice person but I think we both have nothing in common. ,6,1739551437.0,AskWomenOver30,44,0.62,False

I am living in the UK since almost 20 years. In December 2023 when I was in India, i met a girl (38). I really liked her and for me she's the one. We talked for a while and met another 2 times. Finally in may 2024 she told me that she'll never leave India no matter what.

I told her that i really liked her. From her behaviour I feel that she is fond of me but she told me that she gets more of a friend vibe from me. I had gotten very emotional one day and might have had intense conversation with her. She got angry and told me never to message her again.

In Nov 2024 she again contacted me. First thing she did was to make it clear to me that she's still single. She knew I was still single too. This time her behaviour is a bit different. She's very warm to me but still a bit guarded. Even when she goes for a  coffee or something, she'd make sure she tells me that she went alone or it was with 'just a friend'. She just seems to be more concerned. Asking me about my day or whether I have eaten that sort of thing. 

She said she has switched jobs and weirdly her new company is sending her to UK for some time and that too, the same city I am in.

My question is - should I tell her that I'm still interested in her or wait for her to come to UK first? Or just let it go as she said earlier that she considers me a friend.

I used to hate the taste of fermented coffee but after trying a Creativa Statica anaerobic Geisha they did last year I got hooked.

Very impressed. Packaging game is getting wild now but I guess presentation matters.

Already brewed Nestor Lasso Sidra 'Colombia' and Lacti Brasil. I know it says ""Filter"" on their site and packaging but I'm an espresso guy through and through.

Both very lightly roasted which I love. 

Both exceeding my expectations but meeting the great presentation and overall shipping packaging.

Roast date is the day after I ordered and they arrived this morning. I'm in the UK too so shipping is quite fast here compared to some places in the world.

I will not be ordering again for a few months as I'm in between careers. Trying to leave the F&B industry behind me for good as it's messing up with my mental and physical health. I have been trying to get more into training but because I'm great at customer and employee relations I keep getting roped in Store and Area management roles to ""fix"" messes other people made, and I end up being an extremely overpaid barista (underpaid technically since I don't get OT and my hourly wage if I calculate it that way is on par with my supervisors since I am doing 60+ hours a week) since I keep going to the next place that needs fixing instead of having time to reap the benefits of all my work. Rant over soz hahaha.

When I'm back settled I will be back for more. I love how roasters are now getting more into the importance of the processing instead of just where the beans are coming from. How you can make an excellent roast out of beans that previously had a lower value due to not being from a ""renown"" origin.

I'd like to get a rug, new curtains, some cushions... just anything that will add colour, but I just don't know what to go for or what will look right. For example I was thinking a dark blue rug under the sofa/coffee table as it'll go with the wood, but then what about the curtains? A terracotta or mustard rug maybe?

I'm still yet to get all the little bits like artwork, lamps and plants etc, but I feel that I'm at a pretty crucial point here where I need some big colour to make the room not look like an office space.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!

---

The station ticker tape continued scrolling, and Guypha let out a small chuckle out of his lines of bilateral nostrils. Non-psionic races were always so touchy when they met a psychic race such as his, the Uiitan. They would make a fuss at first, but asking a being such as Guypha to not have mental contact with the minds around them was akin to asking them to not smell a snoghog in the room. Maybe a lesser psychic could obey such a request, but Guypha just rolled his eye and carried on.

All these races were so worried about keeping their thoughts private. As if Guypha cared about the rutting habits or jealousies that non-psionic races seemed to want private. After a species grew up a bit and got used to coexisting with psychics they generally came to find mental communication a freeing experience. It would be the same with these humans.

Guypha sipped more of his morning root broth, sitting in a station common area for a bit before getting to work, as was his routine. He liked it here because of the flow of the different races starting or ending their shifts at the docks and storage facilities nearby. Some people started their day with a newsfeed, but Guypha got his news by sampling the thoughts of passersby.

Guypha frowned as the ticker tape went around again. ‚ÄúKEEP MENTAL CONTACT SHALLOW‚Äù was not the usual warning that new races would ask for when shy about meeting a psionic. Usually it would explicitly say ‚ÄúNO MENTAL CONTACT‚Äù.

Guypha puzzled over this while looking up humans on his tablet. Pretty standard squat bipeds, sort of squishy looking, but coming in some pleasing shades of skin. He sat and waited, sipping his hot broth slowly. Finally a small group of these primates came around the corner. The group of three were wearing matching uniforms and laughing with each other loudly. Two of them were carrying their own hot beverages, wisps of steam and an earthy smell wafting through the air with them.

Guypha tentatively reached out with his mind and was able to connect with the group easily. Instantly he could understand their conversation despite not knowing their language. The group had traveled together for many cycles, and were reminiscing about some inside joke from their shared history. Guypha paused for a second, considering the ‚Äúshallow‚Äù warning, then pushed on. He wanted to find more about this ‚ÄúLigma‚Äù character that the boisterous group referenced.

He was reaching just a bit deeper when he felt an instant and overwhelming command. Guypha took his hot root broth and splashed the contents down his own torso.

He shrieked and jumped up. The hot liquid made him hop around, trying to pull his soaked overwrap away from his body to keep from being further burned. He fell to the floor, trying to get the wrap over his head and alleviate the contact with the burning liquid.

One of the humans ran up to him, helping him pull off the overwrap. ‚ÄúHey I am so sorry!‚Äù the human said out loud as Guypha looked up at it with shock. ‚ÄúThey really gotta give you guys better warnings about us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù Guypha responded, eyes wide. He hadn‚Äôt even had time to react when the powerful command had taken over his whole being. Now he was only using the shallowest of mental connections to communicate with the primate, and had to fight the feeling telling him to run away, to get as much distance between himself and that dangerous mind.

‚ÄúYeah, you let those intrusive thoughts win. We humans have ‚ÄòConstant Impulsive Thoughts‚Äô they say.‚Äù The human picked up the mug Guypha had dropped after scalding himself, and placed it on the table with an apologetic shrug.

‚ÄúWe get used to them. Sucks for you psychic-types though. Guess ya‚Äô got caught in the crossfire when I thought about spilling coffee on myself.‚Äù The human went to offer a hand to help Guypha up to his feet, but retracted it when Guypha cringed at the human getting too close.

‚ÄúSo, uh, yeah, sorry about your blue coffee thing.‚Äù The human gave a tight smile, then returned to their group, heading further down the hall.

‚ÄúKeep it shallow,‚Äù Guypha muttered to himself out loud, ‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù",144,1739550758.0,HFY,17,0.99,False

What gets me confused tho is that she'll just say like one thing and then leave. Like just the other day she asked me to show her something I made and then complimented it and then just turned and left. And she's always doing stuff like that.

I am a little bit desperate and could need some advice.

Last Fall we took some Coffee Seeds with us from Africa, because the Tree has been planted by my late grandfather and I wanted to bring a living piece of him back with me, in some sense. I was overcome with joy when they started to sprout and grow, but for the last 2 weeks their growth has stagnated and they don't seem to develop leaves or at least they aren't strong enough to break through the ""shell"" of the original seed. They are in no direct sunlight, the soil is being heated and we keep the humidity high.

Should we remove the shell forcibly in order to help the leaves out or does the plant have to achieve that alone? How would we go about that? A sharp tool or more crack them like a nut? Is changing the soil or fertilizing a good idea, if yes, with strong, store-bought or would some freshly grinded coffee powder be good? Unfortunately I have very little gardening experience.

Any advice and help would be greatly appreciated, as I have a strong emotional attachment to those plants. If you think they are unable to survive, please let me know as well in order to not get my hopes up...

I'm currently in Seoul, Korea, and I recently met a British guy who came here for work. He's a friend of my friend's boyfriend. We exchanged Instagram and messenger IDs and started texting.

We began chatting and made plans to meet up that weekend. When we met, we went to a caf√©, had lunch, drank coffee, and had a great conversation. I thought things went well. (I couldn't drink alcohol at the time due to a temporary health issue, so we met during the day.)

The following week was a national holiday in Korea, and he suggested meeting up. However, I had to visit my hometown to see my parents and relatives, so we couldn‚Äôt meet. Instead, we planned to meet on Sunday, the last day of the holiday. In the meantime, he texted me first a few times, and we had some nice conversations.

On Sunday, we met again, had lunch, drank coffee, and talked a lot. He paid for lunch, and although he offered to pay for coffee as well, I insisted on covering it.

After the holidays, we both returned to our daily routines. Around Wednesday, I texted him first. It was a really cold and snowy day, so I messaged him about the weather and told him to take care not to catch a cold. We shared a bit about our day, but after that, there was no further conversation.

Then, on Sunday, I asked him if he wanted to have dinner together during the week and told him that I would treat him. He replied that he would be really busy that week and might be free on Friday, but he wasn‚Äôt sure. He said he‚Äôd let me know sometime during the week.

I get good benefits some days, but it's turbulent, wears off quickly,  the crash is brutal, and any time I am not medicated gives me time to rationalise not being on meds the next day to drink a boatload of coffee instead.

1ipe8a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ipe8a4/i_used_to_follow_people_without_their_knowledge/,I used to follow people without their knowledge.,"Before you judge me, I wasn‚Äôt following anyone for malicious intentions or anything. I had recently gotten a part in a movie called True Entertainment where I played a killer film director. I had read somewhere that some actors would follow strangers around to get into the mindset of a murderer for a role, so that‚Äôs what I decided to do. 

It was actually about my sixth attempt at stalking someone. The longest time I had spent following someone was when I followed a guy who looked just like Timothee Chalamet for two days, staying in a hotel opposite his house. I gave up once he saw me. A few days after I gave up on following him, I walked to Oxford Street (the movie was shooting in London) to find my next ‚Äúprey‚Äù. I scanned the streets so I could see anyone that stood out from the crowd. That‚Äôs when I saw him. He had slicked back, black hair, an open grey trench coat, a crooked nose, pale skin and a large scar across his face. He moved with something of an urgent pace and he would occasionally tap his head while he walked. I saw him as the perfect victim. I quickly began to follow him. 

It started without anything unusual happening; I simply followed him while he carried on with his daily life, completely unaware of my existence. He stopped at a coffee shop for a few minutes where I was able to see his eyes were oddly yellow and he had black, wool gloves on. I continued to follow him after he left, making sure to not be seen while also trying to find out as much about him as I could. I already knew that he took his coffee black but didn‚Äôt know much else. He seemed to be just a regular person with a few strange features. However, he disproved all of my notions about his normalcy once he reached a baby‚Äôs stroller.

I don‚Äôt think he even looked at it properly. He just walked by it, turned his head to look at where the mother was standing a few feet away, grabbed the stroller and pushed it into the road. He had no way to see if the baby was in there or not, but I think that somehow he knew it was in the stroller. He didn‚Äôt react in any way, he just continued walking while facing forward as if this was completely normal behaviour. The stroller went rolling into the road, heading towards a speeding car. Luckily, the car swerved in time to miss the stroller, leaving the baby unharmed but sobbing loudly. Its mother turned and ran towards the road, grabbing the baby while screaming loudly. Almost everyone on the street turned to look at the mother screaming in the middle of the road, no one even noticing the culprit waking away in his grey jacket. I felt sick to my stomach knowing that he almost killed an infant but I knew that I had to keep following him. 

He continued going about his day as if nothing had happened, showing no sign of regret or remorse. He went to the supermarket, got food at McDonalds and even gave money to a homeless man. It was like I was following around the wrong person, like the attempted infacide was done by someone else and this was just an ordinary man. Hours went by as I continued to watch his every move, waiting for him to commit some new, even more horrific crime. It was getting dark at this point and I expected him to head home soon. But he didn‚Äôt. Instead he froze in place for a solid two minutes before pulling out his phone and staring at a random photo of a man in his gallery for a further five minutes. Suddenly, he began to rush down the street as I silently stalked him. The Sun had gone down completely by the time he had reached his destination, a large park which was now devoid of all light. He entered and I followed him inside. 

He still hadn‚Äôt seen me by the time he had reached a children‚Äôs playground near the centre of the park. He began to play on the playground, going down the slides and climbing on the monkey bars, laughing to himself like an excited child. I hid in a nearby bush to observe this oddly disturbing behaviour. As he began to swing on the swing set, I noticed an elderly man start to approach him, moving using a walking stick to get around. He came closer to the man on the swings and began to call out to him. 
‚ÄúIs this Jeremy? Jeremy Smalls?‚Äù
The swings stopped as the man turned to answer. 
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, Paul. From eBay. I‚Äôm here for the Cabaret CD.‚Äù
The man on the swings stood up, silently approached the elderly man, grabbed his walking stick and began to strike the man in the chest with it. I almost screamed as I watched this brutality. The elderly man tried to run away but fell to the ground without his walking as the man came over and began to kick him in the side. There was an audible cracking of bones from the violent blows. The man started to kick sand from the ground into his victim‚Äôs face, slowly silencing his screams for mercy. He lifted up the walking stick and brought it down on the man‚Äôs head with enough force to crack his skull, killing him. This finally caused me to vomit before I ran for my life. The killer never saw me, he just walked away from the corpse and continued to play on the playground. 

A few days later, I found myself lying awake in my hotel room, unable to sleep despite it being almost three in the morning. I had called the police as soon as I got out of the park but like in most of these stories, they found no trace of the killer other than the mangled corpse of his victim. I barely left my room after it happened because I was terrified of the thought that I‚Äôd run into him. I knew that he hadn‚Äôt seen me but that didn‚Äôt stop my concerns. The movie had been cancelled, for unrelated reasons, and I had a flight out of England in seven hours. I had already packed so I just had to wait until the morning to leave. I continued to lie in bed, replaying the murder over and over in my head. Eventually, I looked at the clock and just decided to get to the airport a few hours early. It was better than staying in this room. I grabbed my suitcase and walked out of the room. I made it about halfway down the hotel‚Äôs stairs when I realised I had left my passport in my room. I turned around and walked back up the stairs before I saw something that still makes my blood run cold while I write this. 

He was outside of my room, trying to use a lock pick to open the door. I still don‚Äôt know how he found me but he did. He made no noise as he attempted to force his way into my room. His face was cold and emotionless and his yellow eyes had no soul behind them. He didn‚Äôt see me as I watched him from across the hall. My heart began to beat so loud that I thought he would be able to hear it. I dropped my bag on the floor, which made a loud thud. He looked up at me with those eyes and spoke to me for the first time. 
‚ÄúRoom service.‚Äù
I ran down the stairs as fast as I could. I heard him desperately sprinting after me jumping down stairs and sliding down handrails in an attempt to reach me. Luckily, I reached the lobby of the hotel before he did, which had enough people in it for him to choose not to go after me. I saw him walk past me, ignoring me as if I was a complete stranger. He walked out of the hotel and I never saw him again. 

About an hour later, I sat in a police station. I was shaking violently and tears were streaming down my face. I had filed my report and an officer was sitting next to me, trying to reassure me. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe now. We‚Äôre gonna catch him.‚Äù
Suddenly, another officer came into the room.
‚ÄúWe found something in the room.‚Äù
The officer next to me stood up and walked outside with the officer. A few minutes later, he came back alone and gave me some horrifying news. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no easy way to say this but we found a corpse in your room. She was in your wardrobe with your passport in her mouth. We think that he put her there so you would find her when you were looking for your passport.‚Äù
I was in shock but was still able to ask a question. 
‚ÄúHow did he know I left my passport?‚Äù
‚ÄúWe think he was in the room with you and the body. He must have waited for you to leave to display her body.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut he was trying to break in.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, he was trying to lock the door from the outside. He must have wanted you to think everything was normal, have you enter the room, find the body but find no trace of him.‚Äù
I went back to the US a few days later. The police never found any more evidence so he was able to get away with everything. 

This story happened years ago but I can never seem to put it out of my mind for one reason; if he was able to hide in my room with a dead body for at least a full day, how would I know if he was here with me now. They never caught him and he was able to find my hotel room despite never seeing my face. How do I know that he couldn‚Äôt find me in the US? How do I know he‚Äôs not in the room with me as I write this?
