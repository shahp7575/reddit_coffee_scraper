1lx33ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1lx33ad/i_tried_to_be_more_assertive_at_work_now_i/,I tried to be more assertive at work. Now I accidentally run a black market for office supplies.,"So I read this article about “being more assertive in the workplace,” and I thought, *Yes. This is my time.* I’m usually the quiet one in meetings — the type who nods enthusiastically while slowly sinking into my chair like a socially anxious marshmallow.

But enough was enough. I decided I would speak up, take initiative, and reclaim my fluorescent-lit destiny.

It started innocently. I went to the supply closet, grabbed a few pens, and emailed the team: “Hey, I grabbed some extra gel pens and sticky notes if anyone needs.”

Boom. Immediate replies. Someone even swung by my desk and said, “You’re a lifesaver. These are the *good* pens.”  
Didn’t know that was a thing, but okay.

Then someone asked me if I had highlighters. I did not. But I said, “I’ll see what I can do.”

The next day, I get to the office early and stockpile a small collection from the supply closet. Nothing excessive. Just enough to make me feel like the Robin Hood of corporate stationery.

Word spreads. Suddenly, I’m the guy you go to when your mouse dies, your chair squeaks, or you need an emergency folder.

People start whispering, “Ask \[my name\], they can hook you up.” I’m getting Slack messages like:

* “You got any Post-it flags?”
* “Heard you might have the ergonomic stapler 👀”
* “Do you deal in fine-tipped markers?”

What. Is. Happening.

Things escalate. One dude trades me a pack of gum for binder clips. Someone else brings me a fancy coffee just to get a single Sharpie. I’m not even trying anymore — I’ve become the de facto gatekeeper of office resources.

Then it got dark.

A coworker pulls me aside in the break room, real cloak-and-dagger style, and asks if I can “source” a whiteboard eraser. Theirs “mysteriously vanished.” They slide me a cookie and walk away like we just brokered an arms deal.

So now I have a drawer full of miscellaneous supplies, a mental inventory of who’s low on paper clips, and the growing fear that HR is going to audit my desk and find a hoard of dry erase markers like I’m prepping for a classroom apocalypse.

I just wanted to be assertive.

Instead, I’m the underground kingpin of OfficeMax.

Moral of the story?  
Sometimes, finding your voice means accidentally starting an unregulated supply syndicate.

I know about Fire Island (and love it!), but I’m hoping to find spots that are a little easier to get to or more casual. 

I’d love recommendations for any friendly hangout spots, community events, mixers, LGBTQ nights, or even low-key coffee shops where people tend to be welcoming and open.

I haven't received a card in 5 years now, not even a text, haven't had a single conversation with anyone I know in 3 years now. Completely isolated. Rarely leave the house , been a thing for 2 decades now so folk just don't know I exist after so long indoors. Never had anyone around to kinda support or give opposing views to my thoughts on why I should just stay inside.

I know by the end of the day I'll be so, so down. It's a beautiful day out there but I always avoid those as it's bright and feel peeps can see me, much better to creep along to Tesco Metro at 10.30pm when no-one can see me.

It's ridiculous I know. I'm 53 today. Any idea what I could do by myself to cheer myself up. Having lived in my house for 20 years, I've lost interest in hobbies, I've watched anything that interested me over that period. Usually I try to just sleep as much as I can during the day, same with Xmas. When I'm awake at night I don't feel like I'm missing out on the day if that makes sense.

I'm thinking about shopping in the local town centre, having a coffee,  maybe a trip into Waterstones. But it's 5 years since I went shopping.

I've tried the odd group but I sit there panicking and unable to speak, you can see folk looking at you thinking 'ok, he's odd'. Or that's how I perceived it anyway ha.

I reckon I could make it to the shops, I think. But I've been thinking this since 8am and I'm still on Reddit two hours later.

The town centres not overly inspiring to say the least,  it's Blackpool. 

If you wanted to cheer yourself up going out but had to spend the day alone, what would you do?

Sorry for the waffle. Don't want this to come across as a 'poor me' post looking for sympathy. I'm not, just completely out of ideas.

1lx30iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1lx30iu/depression_room_turned_infestation/,Depression Room Turned Infestation,"(TW: Roaches, mental health crisis, financial crisis) Hello, I (20F) have AuDHD and just got my first apartment with my fiancé (20M) in February. This is a bit of a long and complicated story, so I’ll try to sum it up as best as I can. When we first moved in my mom got us a Keurig coffee maker, which she had found on FB marketplace from a person who seemed very legit and well kept. I didn’t know until a week or two later that this coffee maker had roaches in it (found out when I made a cup of coffee and saw roaches coming out of the spout). I was obviously horrified, but instead of throwing the damn thing out (like I probably should have) I figured it was in really good condition and so I took the entire thing apart and disinfected it before putting it back together, but it was too late. I started noticing roaches popping up around my apartment so I called the apartment manager and let them know (although I said I didn’t know where they came from, as I was worried they would make me pay for the extermination myself if I told them the truth- I know, immature, irresponsible decision- and this was a reasonable explanation at the time seeing as there are cracks all over the apartment and none of the outlets are properly fastened to the walls). She sent the exterminators in while I was at work and my fiancé was home but I had forgotten to mention the problem to him and so he told the pest control people that there was no problem. Since then we had an incident where we opened the fridge and the handle broke off at the bottom, and I’m trying to fix that before they come in for the quarterly inspection and before I get back to the manager about the roach problem because it’s honestly all just really embarrassing, then there’s the hair dye incident where I stupidly cleaned the cabinet the wrong way after making the even dumber decision to let my friend dye her hair in my apartment and wiped off some of the paint (the manager does know about that, and it’s not that much, just like a centimeter in diameter, but still), then there’s the family issues I’ve been having, then there’s also the fact that out of nowhere just over a week ago both of my clients randomly canceled on me, then there’s ALSO the fact that I tried to donate plasma to get some money to make up for my random financial situation and they said I couldn’t because apparently I’m sick even though I show no signs of being sick and don’t even feel sick and now I can’t donate for another 2 weeks, my fiancé’s hours also dropped out of nowhere, ugh… it’s a lot. With all of this going on all I’ve been able to do is curl up in my bed and cry. Legitimately I almost had my fiancé bring me to the hospital the other day because of how bad my mental state was. The infestation has started to get a little out of control and I don’t know what to do. None of this was supposed to happen. I dug myself into a hole and now I feel completely stuck. It’s not like either of us can move back in with our parents either because they’re all incredibly toxic and borderline abusive people to live with.",2,1752228292.0,Apartmentliving,1,1.0,False

1lx2tj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lx2tj2/how_to_regain_trust_after_boyfriend_scared_me/,How to regain trust after boyfriend scared me during sex?,"I want to start off by saying that this wasn’t completely his fault. Partly mine, partly his.
I have been with my boyfriend since october. 
We started having sex around january/february, which in hindsight was too early for me unfortunately, but I had a sexually abusive relationship in the past (“If you don’t have sex with me i’ll just hire a prostitute” etc. type of relationship, where the man pressured me into it again and again). Unfortunately I did still feel some type of pressure to make my current boyfriend happy and I willingly agreed to have sex and for the coming months I tried to force myself into liking it. He is also quite big and not very gentle which made it hurt, etc. and it just wasn’t fulfilling for me. Unfortunately I did bring it up sometimes but never directly enough (i would just say “please be more gentle”, very briefly) and he never really got it and it never really changed. I just genuinely was unhappy and unfulfilled with our sex life, which made me shrivel up. I would kiss him etc less because I didn’t want everything to lead to sex, which in turn made him unhappy as well.

Now I come to the larger issue, that basically made everything else explode:
This was in may. He had decided to smoke weed and was high. I was sick and said that I didn’t want to have sex because I was feeling ill. I’m a very gentle person so I sometimes have issues with being firm in my boundaries. But that day I did say no, multiple times. But it was never like a “no, go away”, it was more like “no, i would rather do it another day”. And when he started trying to initiate I pushed him away, etc. and this went on for a while.
Eventually I realized that whatever I did or said he wasn’t going to listen and I realized that, unless I caused a huge scene, I wouldn’t be able to get him to stop (a huge scene wouldve been saying no more firmly or maybe even leaving if he didn’t get that I didn’t want to do it). I also didnt want to hurt him or make him upset.
I knew that he wasn’t going to stop and I decided to basically try to relax because otherwise he would end up hurting me (unintentionally). Still, it hurt a lot and I didn’t like it and I felt really bad throughout, I remember thinking “i can’t believe he is doing it” because he did it anyways after knowing that I didn’t want to. I cried through the whole thing but I don’t think he saw.

Some weeks later I talked to him about it, he became kind of a victim himself saying that he would never initiate again or whatever and said that he knew I didn’t like it but didn’t know wether/how to bring it up lol. Kind of odd since if I know something is bothering him my main priority is to bring it up to know why/what he is sad/upset about. Kind of odd that he doesn’t seem to have that same grace left for me. But I let it go.

Some time later we had a fight in which he reacted very victimised (I asked him if he wanted to go out for coffee and he said “sure, I will do it so you don’t think I’m too boring” in a way that was blaming me, all because I asked him to go out sometime. It’s important to note that for months i ALWAYS travelled more than an hour to his house by train and in total he came to my house maybe 4 times. I was fed up because I like going out, on dates, etc and I felt like I only went to his house to watch a movie that eventually ended in sex that I didn’t even find pleasurable, just because he wanted to. I didn’t tell him that though, I approached it from the other direction and said “today is really beautiful outside, let’s go out”.). The issue with victimisation is very prominent and a lot of things I say trigger it, which sucks because then I have to end up comforting him when I’m the person who was hurt by his actions.
After that I was so upset and thought about everything again and realized that I was still not over the entire sex thing so the next day I talked about it again with him. He cried etc. and i also found out he is an addict and a bunch of other things that I had NO clue about (his victim alter ego did appear as well to talk about how bad of a person he is and as always I ended up comforting him when an issue was brought up by me, in this case he kept calling himself a rapist and I had to comfort him and say it wasn’t true over and over again).

Afterwards he apparently talked to his mother and his mother told him that I’m exaggerating etc. and I received a HUGE paragraph talking about how it happened because he is sexually frustrated because we don’t have enough sex (before all of this we had it around 1-2 a week, every time we saw each other). That shocked me and I gave him a piece of my mind very clearly for the first time because I have never had the displeasure of receiving such a disrespectful text. And I would never have expected his mother to prompt him to say stuff like that, especially as a woman. For example, my mother has never said anything bad about him, no matter how much we fought, she always told me to talk things out, be loving etc. (when talking about other fights. I haven’t told her about the whole sex thing). Since then, I dislike her a bit.
I placed down some ultimatums (like that I don’t wish to have sex with him again until I’m ready, that I don’t want to come over to his house all the time, that he has to quit his addiction etc.). He placed an ultimatum that he wants to be intimate again soon, and I did tell him that I was going to go at my own pace and that the door is wide open if he wishes to leave, and he agreed to keep that in mind.

Since then, I do notice that he makes an effort. He is now, as far as I know, 22 days clean, picked me up from my house the other day, etc. The constant self-victimisation is still there and we had a fight recently because of that, but overall the rest is improving. Part of the reasons why we fight more is because now I am very loud and vocal about what I want, what bothers me etc (I still say it really really kindly and have never insulted him and would never yell etc. but if something bothers me I bring it up directly now) and he isn’t used to receiving pushback since before that I would usually stay relatively quiet about issues.

However the main issue is still there: how do I regain the trust and confidence to be intimate with him again? Right now I have a huge aversion to that and him even mentioning anything sex related grosses me out immensely. I get phases where I get really really scared about having sex in general, let alone with him. I do have a high libido just not with him anymore, only by myself.
And it would also be a lie if I said that I don’t think about breaking up sometimes, but I want to try to work it out. At the same time, I don’t know if it’s possible nor if i want to lol.
I’m very conflicted.
The advice i’m looking for is: how can I start to regain trust and not be scared anymore? I am now going to therapy and even if I dont fix it with him I do still want a husband etc in the future and i do want a fulfilling sex life but right now, even thinking about a man touching me intimately is enough to make me cry.

Tldr: boyfriend had sex with me even though I clearly didn’t want to and now I am scared of him. How do I start fixing it?

She left after 8 years without true explanation so I decided not to update or use Facebook or social media from day one. She has done the same ( no discussion) so Ed both have each others friends and family etc and zero updates. We both only posted 3 or 4 times a month anyway. I can understand why I did it I was hopi to win her back and thought it easier to keep it private until I am sure what’s happening but why did she? She left unexpectedly with no discussion and is living with son and family.

She had previously always let me have a code and full access to her phone as a sign of trust ( I genuinely never looked) but had a panic about a month before when she thought I had.

She told me she had a coffee with an ex work colleague which would have been fine until I realised he had driven an hour to meet",1,1752226925.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It’s not that I don’t want to write; I just can’t seem to start. That’s when I decided to try a few essay writing services online to see if paying someone to write my essay was actually worth it.

I tested three writing services:

**assignmentpay.com, writemyessaysos.com,** and **essaywritinghelp.pro**— all of them claim to deliver plagiarism free papers, written by professional writers with academic degrees. Here’s how it went:

**1.** [**Assignmentpay.com**](http://assignmentpay.com?cid=3636)

This writing service looked polished and easy to use. Placing an order was simple, and the price was reasonable for a standard college essay.

**Pros**

* On-time delivery
* Helpful support team
* Structure and grammar were fine

**Cons**

* The essay felt a bit generic
* I had to tweak it for clarity and depth

The paper was plagiarism free, and I got free revisions when I asked. Overall, this service is good if you need a quick essay without expecting something too detailed. A safe middle-ground option.

**2.** [**Writemyessaysos.com**](http://writemyessaysos.com?cid=3636)

This essay writing service actually impressed me. Out of all three, this was the most “human” and professional.

**Pros**

* Fast turnaround (I got my essay the next morning)
* Clear, well-organized writing — didn’t feel AI-generated or robotic
* Followed my specific instructions perfectly

**Cons**

* 100% plagiarism free (checked it myself)
* A bit pricier than the others, but fair for the quality

If you're thinking, “should I pay someone to write my essay and actually get something that sounds like I wrote it?” — this is the service I’d recommend. The writer clearly had a degree in the subject area, and the paper didn’t need any edits. Definitely felt like a professional writer did it.

**3.** [**Essaywritinghelp.pro**](http://essaywritinghelp.pro?cid=3636)

I found this service through a Reddit thread. It’s one of those essay writing services that’s more affordable and good for basic tasks.

**Pros**

* Cheap pricing and easy to order
* Good communication from support
* Delivered on time and passed plagiarism checks

**Cons**

* The writing style was a bit too simple
* Not ideal for complex topics or upper-level essays

It’s decent if you’re in a rush and just want someone to write your essay and keep it plagiarism free. I wouldn’t use it for anything that requires critical thinking or originality, but for quick papers, it works.

**Final Verdict**

If you're looking for essay writing services that actually deliver:

✅ *Best quality:* writemyessaysos — polished writing, felt genuinely written by a professional writer.

💸 *Most affordable:* essaywritinghelp.pro — great for basic essays or online submissions.

⚖️ *Balanced option:* assignmentpay — safe, average-quality service with free revisions.

At the end of the day, whether you're looking for free papers, plagiarism free essays, or just want to pay someone online to help, all three services technically delivered. Just depends on what kind of essay and quality you need.

1lx2m5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1lx2m5z/sugar_and_caffeine_in_drinks_query/,Sugar and caffeine in drinks query?,"I've recently trying to lose some weight and I tend to go for energy drinks as regular coffee doesnt do to much me it makes me feel a bit drowsy then if I drink too much just wired and feel a bit nauseous.

If I need to wake up I'll normally have a couple red bulls or a can of monster. But I'm fixating on calories at the moment. I was 105kgs a year and half ago and through going to the gym, excercising and changing my diet I'm down to 91kgs.

I had a diagnosis of adhd of the inattentive type about 6 months ago (nhs uk) and am still waiting to go on the medication. The specialist explained to me how stimulants work different with people with ADHD.

Now I've been focusing on calorie consumption to lose weight, I'll have a mixed diet and have treats and it's more sustainable for me than just completely cutting of everything snacky. But as long as I keep it under X amount of calories, can vary and I don't beat myself up if I go over it occassionally.

I recently noticed the crazy amount of difference in calories between energy drinks without sugar and sugar so I though I'd switch to no sugar and man I am just not getting the same kick It's more like drinking coffee if anything I get a little drowsy and have to drink a ton to get anything from it which makes me then feel wired/sick.

It's come to me that I was actually  getting the energy boost from the sugar in the drinks rather than the caffeine has anyone else found this? I tend to get an early afternoon crash at work so have now at the moment opted just to have a small choclate bar and single drink either energy or say fanta etc with sugar and it's working, save anyone found anymore reliable sources of energy than sugar in the longterm?",1,1752226752.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1lx2lre,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1lx2lre/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Normally I would push past that feeling and shove as much food in my mouth as I could because I didn’t want to waste or throw out the food because I just spent a lot of money on it. I normally find myself mid binge feeling so guilty that I just throw out all the food and tell myself I’m starting a new diet then a few hours later binge again. So instead I actually stopped when I started to feel full and got a bunch of freezer bags to freeze all the leftovers and told myself if I want to eat/binge on them later or another time they’re there for me to do so. I ended up saving myself from a horrific stomach ache and not being able to sleep from how much pain Id be in if I finished off all that food. I only ate 1/8 of the food I bought.

1lx2imf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrolearningApp/comments/1lx2imf/microlearning_for_nurses/,Microlearning for nurses,"Anyone else tired of sitting through three-hour training sessions about infection prevention? Or clicking through 47 slides about the new medication protocol? 

There's actually a better way to handle nursing education. It's called microlearning, and it's designed around how nurses actually work rather than forcing us into rigid training schedules.

## What microlearning actually means

Microlearning breaks down complex topics into tiny, digestible pieces. Instead of a two-hour module on hand hygiene, you get one focused question about when to use alcohol-based sanitizer. Instead of reading a 20-page document about fall prevention, you answer a quick quiz about identifying high-risk patients.

The key is consistency over intensity. You learn a little bit every day instead of cramming everything into marathon sessions that you'll forget by next week.

## Why this works so well for nurses

Let's be honest - we don't have time for lengthy training sessions. Between patient care, documentation, and trying to grab lunch, finding three uninterrupted hours is nearly impossible.

But a minute? That's doable. You can answer a quick question while you're having your morning coffee or during a brief break between patients. The beauty is that it fits into your actual schedule, not some idealized version where you have hours of free time.

Here's what makes microlearning particularly effective for nursing:

- No scheduling conflicts - Learn when it works for you
- Immediate application - Use what you learned during your next shift  
- Less overwhelming - One concept at a time instead of information overload
- Better retention - Regular practice helps knowledge stick

## How it works in practice

Some [healthcare organizations](https://redgrasp.com/zorgorganisaties) use systems that send nurses one question per day via email. Nothing fancy - just a well-crafted question about hospital protocols, infection control, or patient safety.

You read the question, think about it, click your answer, and get immediate feedback with a brief explanation. Takes maybe two minutes total. But over time, you're covering all the important topics without feeling overwhelmed.

These systems typically see about 90% participation rates from nurses. That's way higher than any mandatory e-learning module. When something is quick and actually useful, people engage with it.

## Real impact on daily work

This approach helps with practical nursing challenges. When your hospital updates the sepsis protocol, instead of hoping everyone reads the memo, you can reinforce the key points through targeted questions over several weeks.

Preparing for accreditation becomes less stressful when your team has been reviewing standards throughout the year, not just cramming before the survey. New graduates can learn hospital-specific procedures gradually instead of drowning in orientation materials.

Even experienced nurses benefit from regular knowledge checks. Healthcare changes constantly, and microlearning helps you stay current without dedicating entire days to continuing education.

## Why traditional e-learning falls short

Those long online modules we all know and... tolerate... have fundamental problems. They're time-consuming, often outdated by the time you take them, and designed more for compliance than actual learning.

Most importatly, they don't fit into nursing workflows. You can't pause mid-module to respond to a patient call light, then come back and remember where you left off. The format fights against how nurses actually work.

Microlearning respects your time and your brain. It acknowledges that you're a professional who can apply knowledge effectively when it's presented in manageable pieces.

The best part is that hospitals are starting to notice. When you can show high engagement rates, improved satisfaction scores, and positive self-reported learning outcomes using methods that nurses actually enjoy, it becomes a win for everyone.

Instead of dreading your next required training, you might actually look forward to that daily question that keeps your skills sharp and your knowledge current. ",1,1752226370.0,MicrolearningApp,0,1.0,False

I hate small talk. Like, if there were Olympic trials for dodging “how was your weekend” conversations, I’d have gold medals *and* a Wheaties box.

I work in a pretty chill office, lots of open space, shared desks, beanbags that no one uses because we’re not in a startup commercial. Anyway, I’m not antisocial, I just value peace. Quiet. Silence. The absence of coworkers talking about meal prep or fantasy football.

My strategy? Noise-canceling headphones. All day. No music. Just vibes. It’s like camouflage. People leave me alone, I get my work done, and nobody’s feelings get hurt.

Until HR sends out a company-wide survey. “How connected do you feel to your coworkers?” Apparently, the average answer was “meh,” and suddenly management decides we need a “more collaborative environment.” Cue doom.

So now there’s a push for “casual daily huddles” and “desk drive-bys.” My manager says to me, very gently, like I’m made of fine china:

>

Cool. Not weird at all.

So in a moment of panic, I do what any sane person trying to seem *more approachable* would do: I bring in a plant. A small potted cactus. His name is Kevin.

I put Kevin on my desk and go about my life.

That’s when the rumors start.

It begins innocently, someone asks, “Oh, cute cactus! What made you bring it in?” I say something like, “He keeps me company.” Normal answer, right? NOPE.

By the next week, someone tells me *they heard* I brought the cactus because it reminds me of home… in Arizona. I’ve never been to Arizona. But okay.

Then a new guy in Sales asks me, in the break room, “So… is it true you used to be in law enforcement?”

What.

Apparently, I give off “former undercover agent” energy. Because I’m quiet. Because I don’t go to happy hour. Because I have a cactus named Kevin.

At this point, it’s spiraling. One person swears they saw a faded tattoo on my wrist. (It was ink from a leaky pen.) Someone else says I only use cash at the vending machine. (Our card reader is broken.)

Then, one morning, I find a sticky note on Kevin that just says:

>

I crack. I laugh so hard at my desk I almost snort coffee out my nose. My manager walks by and says, “See? You’re *so* much more approachable when you laugh.”

Long story short: I tried to avoid awkward conversations and now half the office thinks I’m a reformed criminal in hiding.

Kevin is thriving, by the way. Someone crocheted him a tiny sombrero.

**Moral of the story?**  
Try to avoid small talk and you might just become the subject of workplace conspiracy theories. Also, never name your cactus. It makes things weird.",1,1752226209.0,story,0,1.0,False

Someone drops: *“Go with a live exchanger.”* Cool. But… what the heck does that *actually* mean?

Let me break it down, plain and not-too-polished.

A live exchanger is basically your shortcut — your real-time, no-nonsense tunnel between one currency and another. You see a rate? You grab it. Right then. No slow-motion approvals. No “hold on, verifying your identity” drama. No sudden switcheroo where the number you liked just... vanishes.

Click, confirm, done.

And that speed? That’s not just a fancy extra — it’s survival. In crypto, the price can moon, dip, or flat-out vanish between you blinking and clicking. Wait a few minutes and poof — opportunity gone, like your favorite altcoin after a tweet from Elon.

Live exchangers solve that. They’re built for now — for *this exact moment*, not five minutes ago, and definitely not “we'll email you when it's done.”

One that actually *gets* it? [BitLoga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274). No logins. No passport selfies. No ""Please wait while we process."" You show up, pick the pair you want, plug in your wallet — and it's rolling. Like grabbing coffee from a place that knows your name and doesn’t spell it wrong.

Look, next time someone says *“just use a live exchanger,”* you won’t need to pretend you know what that means. You'll know. And more importantly — you’ll know which one won’t waste your time.

We’re lost and desperate for guidance.,"Hello kind people. I’m writing this with deep worry and sadness, hoping someone with medical knowledge can guide us. Please read carefully — I truly need help.

My father is 50 years old. He has lived with chronic, controlled paranoid schizophrenia since the age of 18. He’s been on medication consistently throughout his life. Around 7 years ago, he was treated for hepatitis C, and he also has liver cirrhosis.


---

What happened recently:

About 8 days ago, he had a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) — a warning stroke. He was hospitalized, underwent tests, and they found he has high cholesterol and high prothrombin index. Thankfully, he seemed to recover well and was discharged just two days later. He looked completely normal — walking outside, smoking, even drinking coffee again. No one would guess he had just been through a major health scare.

But 4–5 days after the TIA, he began experiencing dizziness, elevated blood pressure, and coordination issues. We took him to a liver specialist, thinking these might be due to his liver condition. The doctor scared him by talking about some complications. That evening, after eating, he stood up suddenly, started vomiting, collapsed — and we had to call an ambulance.

He was hospitalized again — this time, a full ischemic stroke.


---

Current condition:

He’s been in the hospital for 3 days now. Doctors say it's good we brought him in quickly, but they also admit they don’t know the exact cause of the stroke. They are running tests but haven’t found a clear explanation yet. We’ve been told the stroke might be in the neck region, though no one has explained anything clearly.

He can move his arms and legs, but not strongly. He’s very weak, and his speech is affected — he seems to force himself to speak. He’s also being given sedatives to prevent a flare-up of his schizophrenia.

The doctors said cholesterol medication could be risky due to his liver condition, and his mental state needs to remain stable, so stress must be avoided — but he’s already very nervous and overthinking everything, which might make things worse.

They also told us bluntly that they don’t know what caused it and that it could happen again.


---

Our situation:

We are in Georgia(country), and unfortunately, the level of medical care here is very limited. We feel completely helpless and terrified. No one is giving us answers. We don’t know if we’re doing the right thing or if we’re making things worse.

Please, if anyone has experience with stroke + liver disease + schizophrenia, or knows what kind of treatment or precautions we should follow, we are begging for your advice. My father is a kind, quiet man who doesn’t deserve this suffering. We’re scared and lost, and our family is falling apart emotionally.

Please guide us. What should we do? What tests should we ask for? What medications might be safe for him? Can he still recover?

Thank you so much to anyone who takes the time to respond. Your kindness could save a life.

Advice on how to deal with it,"Hi Reddit, just want to get some advices and if anyone experienced this before how to move on and thinking straight in situation like this and how it worked out? I'm in my early 30s, this relationship was ""this is it"" to me. We built a very great relationship that we see ourselves being with each other for the rest of life. We both divorced and really know what we looked for and especially introduceing our kids to each others life, I went through very heavy consideration before I introduced him into my kid's life as he's the second guy after the dad I have brought into my kid's life.

Backstory, we've been dating 4 years, engaged last year, planned on getting married within 2 weeks. We both have kids from our last marriage and have been in each others life. We were living together th first 3 years, then he moved to where closes to his daughter and also job. Custody issue on both side we kept doing long distance since end of last year. 

This happened very sudden and quick. We were talking on the phone, and we brought an issue that we talked about long ago and obviously he didn't let go. Long story short, I had sex on the same day with another guy when me and him first meet up for a date after talking a couple days on dating app. I didn't admit before and think it wasn't something proud to share so I kind of brushed off. Now we talked bout it again and he started getting on me more aggressively. So I told him yes I did and I wasn't feeling proud of it that's I didn't want to admit it. Now, he said he can't trust me and that was cheating and he will not marry me. Then we kept talking for a good hour. But he already didn't believe anything I said. 

I admit that I shouldn't not admit what happened at the beginning. But we were just went on the first date and that's considered cheating to him. After the second date with him I already cut off all the communication with any guys coz I see that we could have and build off something incredible which led to us deciding to get married down the road and even committed to the long distance journey for a while.


This is very long but I just want to see other insights and advices how should I deal with at the moment and also with kid. My kid is very excited to go for the trip and seeing us getting married but this is not gonna be the case now. We are gonna give ourselves times to think. I really want to work through this together and not giving up what we've built the last few years but he seems very firm on his decision as that's his standard.

Instead, it was painful my nipples were cracked and bleeding within days  my baby screamed at the breast. I was exhausted, leaking milk on one side while desperately pumping on the other, and getting barely 60–70ml combined. I felt defeated. I felt broken. And worst of all, I felt alone.

If you're there  overwhelmed, sore, and wondering what you’re doing wrong  you’re not alone here's what actually helped me, not perfectly, but enough to get through.

**1. Feed or pump frequently even when it feels never-ending**

At first, I thought I didn’t have enough milk because my baby wanted to feed constantly. Turns out, that’s how milk production works — frequent feeding signals your body to make more. I pumped every 2–3 hours (even at night) for a few weeks and saw a slow but steady increase. It's exhausting, but it helps.

Small win: I started getting 90ml… then 100ml… then 120ml per session. Progress takes time.

**2. Skin-to-skin contact helped calm both of us**

Whenever we were struggling, I’d lay down with my baby on my bare chest, no shirt, no pressure. Just holding him. It helped him root naturally, calmed his fussiness, and honestly, calmed me. My letdown reflex was stronger during these moments, and it built our bond when I felt like I was failing.

**3. The latch matters and it’s okay to need help**

I didn’t know what a good latch looked like. I thought pain was normal. It’s not. I watched videos, read guides, but finally booked one session with a lactation consultant she adjusted how I held him and showed me how to wait for a wide mouth before latching. Game-changer. Within a few days, no more cracks, and nursing stopped feeling like punishment.

**4. I had to start feeding myself again, too**

I was living on coffee, toast, and stress. But your body needs fuel to make milk. I started keeping snacks by my bed almonds, fruit, granola bars. Drank water every time I nursed. It wasn’t perfect, but my energy came back, and my supply felt stronger when I ate enough. Don’t forget: you’re healing, too.

**5. It’s okay to combo feed. It’s okay to take breaks. It’s okay to cry.**

I felt so guilty the first time I gave my baby formula. I thought I was failing him. But you know what? He was fed, happy, and full. And I could breathe. I kept breastfeeding  some days more, some days less but I stopped seeing formula as the enemy It became part of what helped us both thrive.",1,1752225749.0,AttackBaby,0,1.0,False

- Reading those random facts on Snapple caps
- Quick Wikipedia rabbit holes when you're curious about something

Digital stuff that's taken over:
- YouTube Shorts for everything from cooking hacks to history facts
- Language apps that send you one word or phrase per day
- Those quick LinkedIn Learning videos you watch during lunch
- Reddit threads that teach you random skills (like this one!)

Some platforms have figured out how to make microlearning almost invisible.

## An email quiz

[Redgrasp](
https://redgrasp.com/
) does something pretty clever - they just send quiz questions straight to your email. No apps to download, no passwords to remember. You get a quick question, answer it in 30 seconds, and boom - you've learned something new.

The cool part is that everyone in your team gets the same question at the same time. So that safety protocol question you answered this morning? Your coworkers got it too. Suddenly you're all talking about workplace safety over coffee, and that's when the real learning happens.

It's like having a conversation starter that also happens to teach you stuff. Way better than those mandatory training videos that put everyone to sleep.

## Why these examples actually work

The thing about good microlearning is that it doesn't feel like learning at all. When you're reading that word of the day while brushing your teeth, you're not thinking ""time for education!"" You're just living your life and picking up knowledge along the way.

YouTube Shorts are perfect for this. You might start watching a funny cat video and end up learning how to remove wine stains or fix a squeaky door. The information just flows naturally into your day.

The best microlearning examples share a few things:

- They happen during time you're already spending (bathroom breaks, commute, waiting in line)
- They're so short you can't make excuses to skip them
- They connect to stuff you actually care about
- They're easy to share with friends or coworkers

## Making it social changes everything

When microlearning becomes social, it gets way more powerful. That dictionary word you looked up becomes a fun fact you share at dinner. The YouTube hack becomes something you teach your roommate. The email quiz becomes a team discussion.

This is probably why platforms like Redgrasp see such high participation rates. Learning alone in front of a computer screen is boring. Learning something you can immediately talk about with people? That's actually fun.

Even something as simple as word of the day toilet paper works better when it's in a shared bathroom. People end up discussing the words, making jokes about them, or using them in conversations later.

## What makes it work

Learning works best when it stops feeling like work and starts feeling like discovery. Nobody complains about learning random facts from YouTube videos or picking up new words from bathroom reading material. It just happens naturally.

Microlearning works because it fits into your existing habits instead of forcing you to create new ones. You're already checking email, watching short videos, and taking bathroom breaks. Good microlearning just makes those moments a little more educational.

For those who haven't heard of it, microlearning is basically bite-sized learning that happens in small chunks. Think quick quiz questions, mini-lessons, or short videos instead of those marathon training sessions that make your brain melt.

The thing is, not all microlearning apps work the same way. I've tried a bunch, and some are honestly pretty terrible. But when you find a good one? It's like magic.

# What makes a microlearning app actually work?

Here's what I've learned from my research and testing different platforms:

* Super low barrier to entry \- If people need to download an app, create complex profiles, or jump through hoops, they won't stick with it
* Smart timing \- The best apps send content when people are actually likely to engage
* Discussion features \- Learning happens best when people can chat about what they're learning
* Real-world relevance \- Questions and content that connect to actual work situations
* Progress tracking \- Both for learners and administrators who want to see what's working

One platform that stands out is [Redgrasp](https://redgrasp.com/), which takes a different approach than most. Instead of making people download yet another app, they just send quiz questions via email. Pretty clever approach.

# The email approach is surprisingly brilliant

Everyone checks email multiple times a day anyway. When a quick question pops up in your inbox, it takes literally 30 seconds to answer. No apps to open, no passwords to remember, no notifications to ignore.

What's really cool is that they send the same question to everyone in a group at the same time. So you might get a question about workplace safety, answer it, and then end up discussing it with your colleagues over coffee. That's when real learning happens - in those conversations.

The numbers they're pulling are pretty impressive too. They claim 78% of people who receive these ""Question of the Day"" emails actually participate voluntarily. That's wild when you consider how most corporate training has participation rates somewhere between ""meh"" and ""please kill me now.""

# Different flavors for different needs

One thing I love about good microlearning platforms is how flexible they are. Hospitals use them for keeping medical staff updated on protocols. Professional associations use them to help members stay current with industry changes. Even universities are jumping on board.

The key is matching the content to your audience.

# What to look for when choosing

If you're thinking about implementing microlearning (whether for yourself, your team, or your organization), here's my advice:

Start with your goals. Are you trying to onboard new people? Keep existing knowledge fresh? Introduce new concepts? The answer will shape what features matter most.

Also, don't underestimate the power of simplicity. The fanciest platform in the world won't help if people don't actually use it. Sometimes the most basic approach - like those email quizzes - works better than elaborate gamified systems.

# The engagement factor

Here's what really sold me on the microlearning concept: people actually enjoy it. When Redgrasp says 90% of users find their platform more fun than traditional e-learning, I believe it. Traditional e-learning often feels like punishment. Good microlearning feels more like a fun brain teaser that happens to teach you something useful.

The social aspect makes a huge difference too. When your whole team gets the same question, it becomes a conversation starter. Suddenly you're not just learning alone in a digital void - you're part of a group exploring ideas together.

Microlearning isn't going to replace deep, comprehensive training for complex topics. But for keeping knowledge fresh, introducing new concepts, and building learning habits? It's pretty much perfect. Just make sure you pick a platform that actually makes it easy and enjoyable for people to participate.

It really helps me when I'm feeling depressed/lost and in need of a little bit of direction, so I wanted to share! <3

This is the Wheel of Wellness:

https://preview.redd.it/1ot1ne7wi7cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1413af956038a34d2db60a7968374aa5cfd5fe3c

Here are 8 different categories of wellness you can have in your life.

STEP ONE: Read the descriptions and rank each category from highest to lowest. So for instance currently mine would be:

**Highest**  
**-Intellectual wellness** (I'm learning a lot recently, I feel stimulated)  
**-Environmental wellness** (I'm moving soon, and my new place is much better than my previous one)  
**-Occupational wellness** (I'm between jobs but not stressed, though it's lingering on my mind)  
**-Emotional wellness** (doing alright, but I do feel pretty stressed, like a clock is ticking)  
**-Spiritual wellness** (I am not feeling particularly passionate about much right now, though I'm content)  
**-Social wellness** (I made new friends, but I am anxious about whether they like me and my social anxiety has been a lot higher than normal)  
**-Financial wellness** (I'm going into debt next year for student loans and I feel extremely nervous about it and future payment plans. I have a wedding that I need to prepare to attend and I'm worried about costs)  
**-Physical wellness** (I've been having really bad neck pain, and I feel hopeless about it)  
**Lowest**

Ta da! (I'm making this example a bit tame for public use).

STEP TWO: Next you work your way from the lowest to the highest and make to do lists for something/anything you can do today that could help with that bigger problem. To do this you can take a big problem and break it up into smaller more manageable tasks

**Example: (Low Environmental Wellness) ""I hate my living situation, I want to move!""**

To Do List:  
\- Think about what would make me happy in a new living space, what do I want?  
\- Figure out my budget for a new living space  
\- Text \_\_\_\_ and ask about how they found the apartment they loved  
\- Try a new coffee shop/get out of the house for 1 hour  
\- Call \_\_\_\_ to vent  
\- Ask Chat GPT about tenant rights in my state regarding water utility payments in my area

Etc. Etc.

Every problem is complex and so are the emotions that come with them but working with this model over the years has made me feel like I can at least put one foot forward today in my goal of solving a bigger problem. And truthfully, when I'm totally tapped out? just writing down and ranking the emotions on the wheel is opening to me as to what's causing me stress and anxiety.

I encourage you to check it out and I hope you are a little kind to yourself today. <3

1lx2037,https://i.redd.it/ftfv8d7im7cf1.jpeg,The Handle (essay),"The Handle

[A little history: I saw this picture in a BuzzFeed article about well-worn items. It reminded me of the handles on the grief rooms I used to haunt as a victims’ advocate, as well as the time leading up to my mom passing in Hospice two years ago this month.]

The handle tells the truth.

Not the doctors. Not the nurses. Not the chaplains or security officers or folded forms tucked into clipboards. The handle. The worn one. The one that gleams like old bone where anxious hands have stripped the finish clean off.

You can see it - right there, where thousands of fingers have trembled before turning it, where the oily panic of a brother or a mother or a child has left a trace. The door to the “bad news” room in an emergency department doesn’t need a sign. It wears its purpose like an old scar. Quiet. Permanent. Known.

This isn’t the kind of door people use every day. It’s the one they get ushered into. Gently. Firmly. “Let’s step in here for a moment.” And they know. God, they know before the latch clicks shut.

I’ve seen it - hell, I’ve been in rooms like that. When you’re the one giving the news, you become a kind of midwife to grief. You see people collapse without falling. You learn to let silence speak. You feel the weight of every millisecond before they ask the only question that matters: “Are they gone?”

But the door handle… the door handle has felt more grief than any of us.

It’s been gripped by fathers with fists like anvils, steadying themselves before they walk in to identify what’s left of the boy they taught to ride a bike. It’s been held by mothers clutching a stuffed animal tight enough to rip its seams. It’s been turned by cops, chaplains, social workers, and those quiet heroes who keep tissues stocked and coffee lukewarm.

The silver’s worn down to a yellow brass underlayer, not from time - but from people. That’s the difference. Time just passes. But people - they mark things. They leave ghosts in the grease of their palms. They sand away illusions.

And what’s left is this: a handle, half-polished by anguish and acceptance alike, leading to a room no one wants but everyone needs. A room where the world breaks, reshapes, and limps forward anyway.

You want to know who we are? We’re the wear on that handle.

So, I met this girl - let’s call her Sarah -  last year. She helped me through a breakup, we went on a girls’ trip, had deep chats about life, helped me through my long-term break up and for a while it was this sweet, supportive little friendship bubble. Fast forward to now. I’ve moved a few hours away, started a new relationship, and am actually really happy. 

Apparently, that’s where the problem started. Sarah’s been in this relationship of her own, and she vents about her boyfriend constantly - it’s toxic, I tell her but she doesn’t listen. But when it comes to my new relationship? Nothing. No questions, no interest, and she won’t even call my Brian by his actual name - just some random variation like she can’t be bothered to remember.Recently, I drove **3.5 hours after work on a Friday** to go visit her for what I thought was going to be a cute girls’ night. I was due there at 8:30. She texts me last minute saying she’s at a dinner (that she *hadn’t* mentioned before) and will be back by 8:45 latest. Cool, fine.

  
Except it turns into 9pm. I end up going for a run to kill time and get absolutely soaked in a downpour. She tells me to just go into her house and shower - a house I’ve never been to, where her boyfriend (who I’ve also never met) isn’t home. She eventually strolls in at **10:45pm.**The next day, what was supposed to be a wholesome gym & coffee vibe turned into me trailing around shops so she could find an outfit for her event. Then I drove the 3.5 hours home the next day wondering why I felt so emotionally hungover. 

Oh, and to add a little spice - she’s recently fallen out with her group of home friends (allegedly *not her fault*, though the story says otherwise). And suddenly, now that they’ve distanced themselves, guess who’s getting more texts? Me. It's starting to feel like I’ve become the backup friend, filling the gap until someone better comes along.And when we floated the idea of her coming to visit me, it was like, *“Oh yeah, me and my boyfriend will make a weekend of it! We’ll visit you then explore the area!”* Cute, but where was that energy when I drove down on my own, in the pouring rain, to see her specifically?

I don't think she's a good friend and I should just not keep her as close - am I overracting?",1,1752223887.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

It is the 41st Millennium.

The god emperor has sat broken upon the golden throne, ruler of man

On holy terra since the betrayal of his sons.

The world of men has shaken, trembled and decayed

In his “absence”, The Chosen Son now rules in his stead, weeping at what has become of his

father's dream, still he must fight. For as ever the dark comes, Beasts, Traitors, Xenos, Foulness

beyond mortal kine seeks to undo the living, Creatures from the outer dark devour all in their path.

Mortals do battle with the deathless at every turn. Upon these savage times, the greatest of

The emperor's creations, the Adeptus Astartes, do battle with all of this and more alongside

normal men from the Astra Militarum.

Who’s bravest wades into death's embrace with no fear.

Courage and bravery are still found in man, its light fades but is not broken. The ever-shifting dangerous warp tides, upon which the mighty vessels of the Navis Imperialis travel, leak

the reeking taint of corruption, must be navigated between solar systems.

Travel in this cursed realm is the pockmarked bedrock upon which the imperium stands.

  


Deck Sergeant Rochelleteer Krelcrackson was a third-class cog in the great imperial machine, which meant that—on paper—he commanded 50 men and was responsible for maintaining imperial law and increasingly abstract notions of “order” across decks 28B through 28Z of the Xerxes Dawn, a cruiser so vast and venerable that entire generations had been born, lived, served, and died in its rusted bowels without ever glimpsing a porthole.

In theory, his 50 men were tasked with patrolling the thousand and one sins that made up deck 28: hab blocks leaking despair, gantries suspended over industrial chasms like suicidal thoughts, refineries belching gods-know-what into the air scrubbers, corpse-cold warehouse vaults, and the nightmare maze of collapsed sub-decks where oxygen was a rumor and gravity an optional extra.

In reality, Krelcrackson had closer to 30 men, on a good day, assuming no one had died, disappeared, or been thrown into the brig for dereliction, sedition, heresy, or the cardinal sin of ""breathing while unverified."" And yet, promotions came with ceremony. When he’d been dragged—awkward and soot-stained—into Deck 28A’s Officer Country for his formal elevation to Deck Sergeant, he remembered marveling at how clean everything was. Pristine white corridors. Functioning lights. Doors that hissed open instead of groaning like dying beasts. He’d only been allowed in once, like a devout peasant visiting a saint’s tomb. His boots had squeaked on the polished floor like they didn’t belong, because they didn’t. They never would.

Deck 28A, after all, was officer territory—a hermetically sealed preserve where junior lieutenants debated imperial philosophy over actual, honest-to-throne coffee. The rest of 28, his 800-foot vertical slice of responsibility, was pure industrial hellscape, jammed with systems older than reason and hostile to the touch. The layout had been designed, presumably, by a mad architect with a grudge against straight lines and rational compartmentalization. Pipes ran through bedrooms, ventilation shafts opened into vacuum, and some corridors simply ended in blank wall.

In the chaos below, there were salvage teams who made a career crawling through decks crushed by centuries of shipquakes and bad repair work, gently peeling away twisted steel like flayed skin in the hope of extracting something salvageable. Many of them never returned. Falling into one of the inter-deck chasms—a moment of misjudged footing, a weakened plate—meant plunging for hundreds of feet through the guts of the ship until something terminal stopped you.

Rochelleteer’s own father had once made a pilgrimage to the keelplate—ten years for the privilege: five years there, five back, most of it spent in line waiting for transit permits. A full year was wasted getting clearance to enter and exit the engineerium, which was one part engine maintenance cathedral, one part radioactive death trap. The man had returned, slightly more luminous than when he left, but satisfied. It had been the last thing he wanted to do before dying of warp sickness and low-level cosmic radiation at the impressively old age of 40.

Such was life on the Xerxes Dawn. Long, if you were lucky. Nasty and brutish, if you were honest. Even loyalists like Rochelleteer knew that the lower decks were a meat grinder of paranoia and survival, where the authority of the Emperor’s word was doled out through irregular patrols, screaming vox-casters, and the occasional purge to keep everyone guessing. Salute the wrong officer, and if they were later marked as heretic? Well—congratulations, you’d just earned yourself a bolt to the head for treason by association.

He wasn’t bitter about it. Not really. He was born for this. Literally. His mother had been ship’s sanitation detail; his father, maintenance engineer third class. His grandparents before them had served. So had their parents. The Krelcracksons had been part of the ship for generations. It wasn’t just their home, it was their world. Their quarters even had a little handcrafted diorama of the Xerxes Dawn, supposedly forged from flash-gold and iron, inlaid with diamondtine. There was a single thin red line painted across one midsection—Deck 28—their ancestral hunting ground.

That little stripe on the model? That was them. Their lives, their bloodline, their meaning. An 800-foot vertical wound full of toxic atmosphere, black mold, pipe-maze hallucinations, and heretics that sometimes came out of the walls. And every single day, Rochelleteer woke up, strapped on his beat-up flak armor, and went out to defend it from chaos, disrepair, and the kind of treachery that lurked in the eyes of men who’d stopped blinking.

He didn’t do it for glory. He didn’t even do it for the Emperor.

He did it because that’s what deck rats did. You served. You survived. You hoped the next collapse didn’t take you with it. And you kept your boots polished—just in case you were ever summoned back to Officer Country to die ceremonially, like a good little cog in a machine too vast to care.

He stumbled out of his so-called luxury private quarters—an inheritance more by attrition than honor—into the communal mess, a space that managed to be both utilitarian and vaguely dignified in that way only the Imperium’s ""valued personnel facilities"" could achieve. Once his father’s, now his, the quarters were slightly larger than a standard cell, and mercifully sealed against the more flavorful aromas of Deck 28’s lower vents. A luxury indeed.

The mess hall was shared by what passed for the elite of Deck 28: essential personnel—the barely-hinged, half-sainted mechanics, radiation-scarred engineers, grizzled vox-techs, and permanently soot-dusted inspection leads who managed to keep the ship’s most haunted deck from collapsing outright. They were the trusted, the reliable, the “well-compensated,” if by “compensated” one meant occasionally receiving meat that hadn't screamed, and sleeping in bunks that weren’t actively trying to kill them.

The air here was, for once, almost breathable. A faint scent of thyme or possibly coolant filtered through the vents, and the long rows of bolted-down benches and scratched steel tables were occupied by men and women wolfing down what—by the standards of the Imperium—qualified as a meal. Actual food, no less. Grown not in ancient nutrient vats or recycled protein slurry beds, but in the hydroponics bays, or one of the cavernous “subterranean” growing farms tucked away beneath the spinal decks.

Rumor held that the most recent bounty came not from their usual sludge-fed crop rows, but from Deck 27, one of the famed agricultural decks—a mythical land of plenty located just high enough above Deck 28 to be inaccessible, but low enough to breed wild tales. Depending on who you asked (and how long they’d been drinking), Deck 27 was either a light-drenched paradise of rolling green pastures and orchards thick with fruit, or a festering horror-show infested with genetically enhanced vermin, rogue servitors, and fungi that grew into your mouth while you slept.

This morning’s prize, however, sat right in front of him: a heap of what were being optimistically labeled o’ranges. They were yellowish-brown in hue, soft to the touch, and when you impaled one open—because ""peeling"" wasn’t really an option—you were greeted with an oddly meaty core, thick pulpy fibers surrounding blood-red seeds that gleamed like angry pearls. It smelled… almost edible. Sweet, with a whisper of rot. Faintly acidic. Slightly metallic.

“This one doesn’t even have mold,” someone said, awe barely concealed beneath sarcasm.

There were grunts of agreement around the table as another worker held up his own specimen—already going green around the stem and sprouting what looked suspiciously like spines. Still, half a crate had shown up unspoiled. A minor miracle. No one said it out loud, of course, but the implication was clear: someone must have paid for this shipment. Or killed for it.

“You know,” muttered Grissom, a senior vent tech with three fingers and too many stories, “back when I was on waste reclamation detail, we found a whole pile of ‘o’ranges’ growing down by the sump lines.”

“They weren’t oranges, Grissom,” someone snapped. “They were eggs. Something hatched out of one.”

A pause. The chewing slowed. Someone spat.

Still, Rochelleteer picked up his o’range and bit into it, teeth squelching through the fibrous flesh with a wet crunch. Sweet. Sharp. Unsettlingly savory.

He didn’t stop. Not because it tasted good—but because it wasn’t the worst thing he'd ever eaten on the Xerxes Dawn.

Not by a long shot.

It was at that precise moment—halfway through the o’range and already questioning his life choices—that one of the quartermaster’s lads burst into the mess like he’d just been promoted to Living Saint. Breathless, soot-smeared, and still wearing half a rebreather that dangled from his shoulder like a dead animal, he stood atop the entrance grate and bellowed with the righteous zeal of a man about to cause a riot:

“Twelve boxes! Twelve full boxes! Fresh shipment just in! Captain’s orders!”

The mess hall fell silent, save for the slow, ominous clatter of a half-chewed seed hitting someone’s tin tray.

“Twelve… boxes of what?” someone finally muttered.

The lad grinned wide enough to show off a missing molar. “O’ranges, lads and ladies! A whole dozen crates! Apparently, it’s the Captain’s birthday, and he’s decreed extra distributions of fractions to mark the occasion!”

A low collective groan rolled through the room like a decompression wave.

The Emperor’s golden arse, fractions.

See, on ships like the Xerxes Dawn, nobody ever got whole things unless you were an officer, a saint, or particularly good at stabbing people in the dark. Everything else came in “fractions”—carefully measured rations diced into mathematically equitable misery. You didn’t get a fruit. You got .25 of a fruit. You didn’t get a slice of bread. You got five-sixths of a carbohydrate loaf, calibrated by some forgotten cogitator’s interpretation of caloric minimalism and human tolerance thresholds.

The captain’s birthday was, therefore, less a celebration and more of a statistical anomaly. Still, there were rules—even in hell—and the birthday of the man who commanded the floating city of agony was a sanctioned excuse to hand out an extra .33 of something edible without a requisition form soaked in blood.

A few cheers went up. Some ironic. Some not.

Rochelleteer leaned back, wiped pulp from his chin with the sleeve of his coat, and offered a slow, cynical clap. “Ah. The Captain turns another year closer to martyrdom, so we all get an extra bite of fruit that doesn’t glow. We truly are the Emperor’s chosen.”

Across from him, Grissom nodded solemnly. “It’s a good year. Last birthday we got fermented nutrient paste and a pamphlet about morale.”

Someone else chimed in: “One time we got spire-corn soaked in that clear stuff they use to clean the void suits. Tasted like treason.”

The lad from quartermasters, seemingly undeterred by the sarcasm radiating off every table, beamed with the proud certainty of the recently indoctrinated. “They say the fruit came direct from Deck 27! The good fields. No mold. No teeth. No screamers.”

This earned another pause.

No screamers?

That… almost made it suspicious.

Rochelleteer sighed, stood, and tossed the rind of his o’range into the recycler with a wet splat. “Well then. Let’s all go get our .33 portion of alleged joy. I’d hate to miss my chance to chew on a chunk of vitamin C and self-delusion while it’s still warm.”

And so, with the grim resignation of men who knew full well the next miracle might come in the form of a hull breach or a purging servitor, the crew of Deck 28 shuffled out of the mess hall and toward the line—toward a few precious extra bites of fruit-like substance gifted by a man they would never see, whose birth was being celebrated with rationed sweetness and a lingering fear that the next batch might bite back.

Eventually, the mess hall’s simmering excitement—if it could be called that—was brought to heel by the heavy clomp of regulation boots and the unmistakable bark of a man whose voice had been permanently seasoned by years of shouting over engine screams and gunfire.

Watch Sergeant Helck, broad-shouldered, bald as a radiation bulb, and perpetually looking like someone had just insulted his mother, stepped out from behind the commissary line with the grim authority of a man who’d spent far too long keeping lesser fools alive. His voice cut through the ambient clatter like a chainsword through soft meat.

“All right, you lot! Grab your assigned crate o’ranges and get them distributed to your crews!”

There was some motion—reluctant, begrudging, careful—as the assembled deck-hands, engineers, and patrolmen stepped forward to receive their imperial fruit alms. The sergeant continued, voice rising as the inevitable grumbling started to bubble under the surface.

“The Captain’s gift is not to be squandered—nor is your time! So don’t stand around waiting for your share like beggars in the underhabs. Take your box, take your slice, and then get your arses back to post!”

He stabbed a finger toward one of the unfortunate souls lingering near the exit. “Morgan! You’re on sewer maintenance rotation. Yeah, that’s right, lucky you. The venting arrays need to be back online by tomorrow, and if they’re not—”

He paused for effect, allowing the silence to stretch dangerously.

“—Dec-Lieutenant Seripstena is going to make us all run laps on her cursed obstacle course again.”

A groan rose from the room like gas venting from a ruptured plasma line.

Seripstena’s ""training course"" was the kind of thing that left grown men sobbing into their boots and begging for a transfer to shipwide sanitation. It involved low oxygen conditions, randomly electrified gratings, and a timed crawl through a collapsed maintenance shaft euphemistically dubbed “The Womb.” No one who’d been through it once ever wanted to go again.

“And I know for a fact,” Helck went on, his voice now gliding into the razor's edge between dry humor and visible contempt, “that not a single one of you has been back there since basic. Don’t pretend otherwise.”

Laughter. Nervous. Hollow. True.

“So,” he said, turning back to Morgan and the rest of the sewer crew with the weight of doom, “if you don’t want to be hauling your sorry hides through electro-shocked crawlspaces and hydraulic death traps at 0500 tomorrow, get those sewers back online. Especially the primary flow return—last thing we need is that thing backwashing into the Rec Block.”

A new silence fell, heavy and horrified.

Everyone in the room had heard what happened the last time the Rec Block got flooded with untreated waste. No one talked about it. No one had to.

“They’re reopening it for deck time at 0900 sharp, and by the Golden Throne, if I see even one child ankle-deep in runoff filth, I will personally requisition punishment detail for every one of you back to Munitions Sorting. Unshielded.”

A few in the crowd visibly paled. A man in the back crossed himself.

Helck glanced at his chrono, then gave a curt nod. “Right. That’s your morning sermon. Now move.”

The mess hall snapped back to life with the swift, mechanical rhythm of disciplined panic—men and women filing out, fruit crates in hand, grumbling and cursing and already mentally preparing to dive into sewage systems that hadn’t been touched since the last minor hullquake. Rochelleteer took one last look at his gnawed o’range, sighed, and followed them out into the guts of the ship.

The Captain’s birthday had come.

And with it, the inevitable stench of duty.

As Rochelleteer wound his way through the labyrinthine arteries of the Xerxes Dawn, descending step by rusted step, crawling through low passageways meant for ducting rather than men, and navigating gantries suspended over yawning pits that hissed and whispered with distant machinery, he reflected—as he often did—on the absurdity of it all. His destination: Level 3 Garrison Deck, the rat’s nest his men called home.

Most of his squad bunked in the main barracks. A few of the old hands had their own little nests squirreled away—converted utility closets, sealed access crawlways, some even claimed to have sealed-off chapel alcoves from some forgotten Crusade—but the bulk of them lived, slept, ate, and occasionally bled in the garrison proper. It had all the essentials: communal feeding stations, air reclamation units that wheezed like dying lungs, a power nexus with redundant emergency relays that only sometimes caught fire, and the all-important cleansing showers, because Deck 28 had a way of sticking to you. Sometimes physically. Occasionally psychically.

As he rounded the last bend near the main service stair, he passed the primary armory—a slab of reinforced ceramite with gunmetal locking sigils and sacred hexsteel bolts the size of his forearm. And, of course, the servitor.

Its red ocular array locked onto him the instant it detected motion, pulsing with that faint rhythmic flicker that somehow always managed to scream disdain. It was an aging combat chassis, retrofitted with security protocols and just enough brain matter left to be offended by existence. It had the unmistakable air of a thing that hated its duty, hated you, hated the concept of access control, and especially hated the idea that anyone other than it could ever be trusted with a gun.

Even now, after years of recognition, logged entries, retinal scans, encoded access glyphs, and ten thousand interactions, the thing still ground through its authorization subroutines with a sullen sluggishness that spoke of personal grudge.

It tracked him with the intensity of a martyr waiting for permission to pull the trigger.

Rochelleteer slowed only slightly, giving it a sidelong glance as it buzzed and clicked through the microsecond rituals of reluctant compliance. He never needed to go in, not today—but he knew from experience that not acknowledging it would only prolong the passive-aggressive tension. Machines didn’t sulk like men, but they remembered.

It always reminded him of the gun-deck servitors—those skeletal, servo-limbed horrors that descended from the upper decks during purge cycles, screaming catechisms of flame and salvation. They came down sometimes for “sweet patrols”—a euphemism for hunting rogue crew, hidden mutants, or simply those who blinked wrong during census. Cold, mechanical. At times they were empty husks, dispassionate and silent as death.

And other times...

In the Emperor’s name, the rage they showed.

Sometimes they screamed as they killed—voices rising not from lungs, but from speakers so old they crackled like fire, bellowing righteous fury and divine judgment with an almost evangelical glee. There was passion in it. As if somewhere, deep in the faded brain slurry inside their armored skulls, something remembered hate.

He stepped past the armory, the door’s access light flicking green a fraction of a second too late to be polite. The servitor gave a final clicking exhale, almost like a sigh.

“Yeah, yeah,” Rochelleteer muttered under his breath, “I still outrank you, buckethead.”

The servitor’s mono-eye dimmed in what he could only interpret as seething mechanical loathing.

He kept moving. The barracks were just ahead, the air already tinged with steel, sweat, and recirculated memories. Another day. Another round of duty. Another crawl through the machine’s veins.

And always, always, something waiting in the dark that hated the light just a little more than he did.

As Rochelleteer stepped onto the Garrison Deck proper, the familiar atmosphere hit him—not just the recycled air tinged with grease and ozone, but the soundscape. That unmistakable cocktail of clanking boots, distant murmurs, and the soft mechanical growl of duty pressing down on tired flesh.

But more than anything, it was Sergeant Briford who gave away the mood.

You could always tell how things were going by the sound of Briford.

He was more machine than man these days—enough so that the clunk and whirr of his mismatched augmetics could be heard from halfway across the deck, echoing like an angry clock trying to walk itself to death. A faulty knee actuator gave a percussive clang with every third step, and a servo-arm mounted where his left shoulder used to be hissed with a wheeze like it was tired of the job too. That arm, incidentally, hadn’t worked properly in years, but no one dared suggest it be removed—not unless they wanted a lecture that started in profanity and ended in blood.

Like most who’d suffered the “mercy” of battlefield augmentation, Briford had developed a fierce addiction to painkillers—anything to dull the raw, screaming edge where nerve endings met steel, where living tissue was forcibly taught to obey cold circuitry. But he was still technically human, and thus still haunted by what had been cut away to make room for obedience.

Rochelleteer understood the fear.

He’d managed to avoid any catastrophic injury himself—more through paranoid caution than skill—but he’d seen it happen. Too many times. A snapped limb in a pressure hatch. A hand sheared off by misaligned maintenance machinery. A jaw crushed under a falling gantry. One moment flesh, the next: wiring, staples, rivets. The Mechanicus didn’t ask permission. They salvaged. You were property. You were repurposed.

Crew who came back from the medicae with gleaming replacements often said the same thing: it never shut up. The augmetics made noise. Not just mechanical noise—mental noise. It scratched at the edge of thought. Dreams became numbers. Breaths became calculations. Sleep was replaced with static.

Sarah had been the worst.

Poor Sarah, who’d barely survived that collapse in the ventilation shaft—skull crushed, face a ruin. The augmenters had saved her. That was the word they used. Saved. Bolted a half-helix cranial plate to the side of her head, plugged her into cognition implants with red-lit runes and blinking data-links. She was alive. Functional. But she no longer slept.

Sometimes, she would wake screaming, clutching her head as if trying to pry something out. She claimed the device whispered to her in binaric—screamed inside her skull. Numbers. Equations. Pain rendered in code. She dreamed in sequences now. She’d scrawled entire walls in the garrison with recursive patterns once, until they sedated her and locked her quarters with a double-seal.

They said she was still loyal.

They said.

Rochelleteer passed Briford without comment. The old sergeant didn’t greet him—he was too busy berating someone over a misfiled patrol rota, each word punctuated by a hiss of breath and a clank of hydraulic displeasure. Briford’s voice had a metallic undertone now. His vocal cords had been partially replaced after an airlock decompression incident. It gave everything he said the tone of a vox-unit at war with itself.

Rochelleteer winced as the sound echoed off the plating.

He couldn't help but imagine it: a future version of himself, limping down these same corridors, full of replacement parts and half a soul, muttering fragmentary prayers into static.

The machine never took you all at once.

It just waited. Piece by piece. Bolt by bolt.

Until the only thing left was a number.

Still, Rochelleteer couldn’t help but notice the eyes.

He'd barely cleared the threshold of the Garrison deck before more than a few heads turned—first with reflexive suspicion, then widening into unfeigned astonishment. He might as well have walked in dragging a xenos head on a pike. The crate he carried wasn't standard issue, wasn't marked with any grim Administratum scrawl or faded hazard tape. No, this box was a miracle—a treasure trove of o’ranges, nearly a hundred by his count, and he was very aware of what that meant to the men and women in this room.

To them, fruit wasn’t food. It was legend.

His squad, his people—loyal bastards every one of them—subsisted, if that’s what you wanted to call it, on a daily regimen of nutrient paste, rehydrated meal blocks, and assorted abominations conjured in the nightmarish kitchens of Garrison Supply Division Theta. None of it had texture. None of it had taste. Most of it hissed when you opened the tin.

He thanked the Emperor daily—quietly, inwardly—for the rank he'd earned and the slivers of privilege that came with it. Those promotions had bought him a seat at slightly better mess halls and the authority to avoid the gray ration bricks that looked like concrete, tasted like regret, and occasionally pulsed when left unattended.

And it was because of this—the rare, blessed freedom from the daily slurp of sludge—that he understood exactly what this crate meant to the others.

So when he walked in, unceremoniously depositing the crate on the central briefing table like he was tossing a bag of dirty laundry, and watched every conversation in the barracks die mid-sentence, he allowed himself something rare: a smile.

A real one.

He never got to bring good things. Orders, drills, death notices, duct maintenance alerts—yes. Good things? Almost never. But today, here he stood, bearer of citrus.

As the crew slowly gathered, drawn forward like moths to some pulpy, fragrant flame, Rochelleteer pulled a single o’range from the crate and examined it with exaggerated reverence. The skin was thick, pitted, rubbery like treated leather. Peeling it required not just fingernails but willpower, and possibly a small blade. He chose willpower.

He worked it open with care, strips of resistant peel curling away as he pried through the stubborn flesh, hands slick with juice and effort. Inside, the thing glistened—meaty pulp, blood-orange segments, seeds the color of dried blood. He held it aloft at chest height, like a preacher lifting some sacred relic, and looked out over the gathered assembly.

They were silent now, watching. Waiting. Wondering which one of them had died, or who was being punished, or if this was some kind of morale-breaking drill.

Only one of them—Glipson, if Rochelleteer remembered the name right—had the nerve to step closer. One of the newer recruits. Eager, smart, not yet broken.

Rochelleteer turned toward him, then toward the group at large. He held the o’range out in one hand and gestured at the crate with the other.

“All right, listen up,” he said, loud and clear. “By the grace of the Emperor and the Captain’s personal birthday, we’ve been blessed with a shipment of actual produce. That’s right—real fruit. Not vat-spawned. Not recycled. Not paste.”

A murmur of disbelief rippled through the crowd like a tremor.

“You’ll each get one. Maybe two, if you don’t get caught pocketing extras. This is not a drill. This is not a test. This is a miracle. Act accordingly.”

He turned back to Glipson and, with a little nod, handed him the opened o’range. The young man accepted it like it might detonate, staring at it in disbelief.

Then the rest of the crew surged forward—not in a riot, but in the slow, reverent approach of people who knew better than to rush something holy. There was no cheering, no shouting. Just awe. Gratitude. The faintest flicker of hope.

And for once, in a ship full of shadows, recycled air, and recycled flesh, Rochelleteer got to feel like something other than a walking death schedule.

Today, he was the man who brought fruit.

And that was enough.

As the crew began to crowd the crate like hungry pilgrims at a shrine, the first signs of chaos started to bubble up—grunts, jostling, a few raised voices debating whose turn it was or who’d already touched which fruit. That’s when one of the commissary assistants—young, overwhelmed, and likely regretting every life choice that had brought him here—pushed his way through the mass with the frantic energy of someone who knew this could quickly turn into a disciplinary report or a fistfight.

“One each!” he shouted, flailing a clipboard like it would protect him. “Take one! You’ll get another if there’s enough for everyone!”

His voice cracked by the end, and no one missed it. But the crowd began to calm slightly, filing into a rough semblance of a line, or at least an orbit around the crate. Hunger could be managed, if hope was dangled with it.

Rochelleteer, meanwhile, stepped back and surveyed the room with a calculating eye. It wasn’t just about fruit—it never was. On a ship like the Xerxes Dawn, favors were currency, and a single overlooked kindness could breed years of grudging loyalty… or silent enmity.

He walked briskly over to the head of the commissary—a leathery old man named Gilven who looked like he'd been carved from dried meat and vacuum-sealed—and clapped a hand on his shoulder.

“Get your staff up here,” Rochelleteer said quietly. “They get one, too.”

Gilven gave him a skeptical squint, the look of a man who’d seen kindness weaponized too many times. “Not your responsibility, Sergeant.”

“No,” Rochelleteer replied, “but they’re the ones who make sure my lot don’t starve on paste bricks and water packs. You think I want them forgetting my face when a crate goes missing or a requisition gets ‘delayed’?”

Gilven grunted, but gave a nod. “Fair.”

The sergeant didn’t stop there. He made his way down toward the cargo gang next—dock rats and shipment lifters who moved the crates that kept Deck 28 breathing. Most weren’t technically his men, but they were part of the great interconnected machinery of survival. And it never hurt to grease the gears.

“Lukis, Fendral, Rimm,” he called out, naming a few of the more reliable movers. “Come grab one. Bring the loaders who hauled the crates from Deck 27 too, if you can find them. No sense in handing out gifts and pretending the hands that carried them don’t matter.”

They came, cautious but grateful, offering nods and murmured thanks. A few of his own patrolmen cast sideways glances—jealous, calculating. One or two frowned at the prospect of sharing.

He met their eyes, flat and cold.

“Some of you’ll get doubles,” he said loud enough to be heard. “Not all. But this isn’t just for us. The Emperor teaches generosity in strength. A closed hand hoards food. An open hand holds a weapon. Think about which one you want to be.”

That shut them up.

He wasn't some starry-eyed idealist, of course. He knew exactly how these things worked. A shared ration now might mean a crucial air tank later. A spare weld job done without paperwork. An extra set of hands in a corridor when things got dark and ugly. Generosity wasn’t just charity. It was strategy.

And besides, there was more than one way to make an enemy on a ship like this—but not sharing the good, while expecting comradeship in the bad? That was the fastest route to find yourself alone with a jammed lasgun and no one answering your vox.

So the o’ranges were shared—not evenly, not perfectly—but wisely. His men got their share. The commissary staff got theirs. The cargo crews too. A few even made their way to the lower-tier repair teams, passed hand to hand like sacred relics.

And for one brief moment in the rusted heart of Deck 28, it felt like something approaching community. Like the ship wasn’t just a devouring god of steel and fire.

And for Rochelleteer, that was enough.

Everything had been going unnervingly well—fruit distributed, smiles exchanged, even a brief, flickering moment of camaraderie—until the vox-unit at the far end of the barracks coughed to life with the jagged rasp of a signal pushed too hard and too fast.

“Code Red—possible armed conflict. Quadrant Two, Level-H. Shots fired. Civilian scatter confirmed. No response from local patrol. Repeat: gunfight in progress.”

Rochelleteer froze, the peel of another o’range still clinging to his hand like the remnants of some lost peace. He let it fall, sticky and fragrant, onto the floor as he turned on his heel and strode through the crowd with renewed gravity.

“Damn it.”

The last of the o’ranges were being handed out, the crate all but empty, just rinds and residue left behind. The crew were still chewing, still happy—still slow. That was about to end.

He reached the front of the room and barked, loud enough to shake the rust off the support struts.

“Teams to alert status! Gear up. Guns out. Helmets on!”

Men and women snapped into motion, suddenly aware the celebration was over.

“All right, listen close!”

He began directing with the mechanical clarity of someone who’d done this far too often, too long, and in far too many bad places.

“Team One and Team Two—perimeter duty. Get eyes on access tunnels and choke points. I want two-man sweeps at the corners and vox updates every thirty seconds.”

“Team Three—you’re my sweepers. Full arms, hard entry. Load up. You’re going straight into Level-H. Sweep and clear. Shoot what shoots. Secure what’s left.”

“Team Four, backup and med support. You move when I say move. You don’t jump early. I want casualty response, not crossfire confusion.”

He turned toward the lingering cluster near the back of the room, where five men stood uneasily—Team Five.

Team Five was… complicated.

Five men, just like the name said. And like all things aboard the Xerxes Dawn, the numbers were never the whole story. The team was an even split—almost. Three of them were solid. Rock-steady. Trusted with weapons, keys, and sometimes his personal seal when needed. The other two?

Absolute disasters in uniform.

But he kept them. He needed them. Because you don’t just leave your liabilities unsupervised—you stick them in the most visible, static post possible, where their ability to screw things up was reduced to a low, manageable simmer.

He looked straight at Richmond, the de facto lead of Team Five—a man whose file read like a bad joke, but who had a surprisingly unshakeable knack for spotting trouble before it brewed.

“You’re staying here. You know the drill.”

Richmond gave a lazy salute, already sliding his lascarbine onto his shoulder. “Watch the door, look scary, don’t talk to anyone. Got it.”

“Good. And Richmond—if something comes through that isn’t one of mine, you shoot it. Don’t ask. Don’t think. Shoot.”

He turned back to the rest of the crew, voice rising again.

“Let’s roll, people. This isn’t a drill. Shots have already been fired. And if it bleeds and screams and smells like heresy, I want it dead before it reaches another deck.”

Gear lockers slammed open. Boots hit steel. The clatter of armor being fastened filled the room like a rising storm.

Rochelleteer strapped on his own rig, finalizing his vox-tap and loadout as the tension began to mount. He looked around one last time, nodded once, and stepped into the corridor with the grim certainty of a man who knew the fruit was over, and now the blood was coming.",1,1752223858.0,EmperorProtects,0,1.0,False

Had another fight with my mom (F, 40) because I (F, 15) allegedly won't do anything around the house. I have diagnosed depression which is dismissed all the time by my mom. 
Today, she came to my room and started yelling about the fact that my bed wasn't made (I literally woke up an hour ago). 

She also started yelling about the fact that I don't do anything around the house (which is untrue, I do most things around the house). The reason as to why I haven't been doing anything is because I'm just so done with it. My mom constantly calls me ""her personal slave"", and treats me like one. She orders me around while she sits down on the couch and drinks her coffee. She constantly makes me do stuff that require bending over (which hurts me because I have problems with my lower back) and overall treats me like i'm her personal maid. 

This year, in April, she forced me to crawl around the living room and beg for her forgiveness. She made me kiss her hand and then slapped me because I disobeyed her.

I am a petite female (5'0"" / 153 cm, 110 lbs / 50 kg). A colleague of mine told me about calorie tracking a year ago and I've been doing it every since. I also started weightlifting. I want to lose some weight/fat, without losing muscle, so I am eating 1500 kcal a day and 120-140 g protein. 

As we all know, 1500 kcal is not /that/ much and I just like to eat / am a boredom eater, so volume eating has really helped with the food noise. 

My daily ""menu"" looks as follows: 
- breakfast: 250 g lactose free quark, 15 g chia seeds, 30 g oatmeal, lungo coffee and 50 g blueberries, with an iced latte (lungo coffee and 150-200 ml lactose free milk)
- lunch: a (admittedly huge) salad with a lot of veggies (cucumber, tomato, corn, carrot, salad), some form of chicken (100-150 g), 50 g avocado, 30 g feta cheese and 100-150 g cottage cheese as dressing
- snack: 200 g carrots and an iced latte 
- dinner: something meal prepped (this week, it's 40 g protein pasta, tomato sauce with skyr, 100 g chicken, paprika, zucchini and 10 g light cheese
- late night snack: 200 g skyr with 200 g frozen fruit

I eat all this throughout the day (e.g. I often divide my salad over two portions, one at noon and one around 3pm) and like to savour my food by eating slowly (e.g. I can easily take me two hours to finish my breakfast, as it's filling and I am working while eating), so it looks like I am eating all day long, which is true, but it helps with the food noise and I stay within my calorie deficit. 

The same colleague has moved offices and we now sit together in the same room since yesterday. Yesterday evening, she told me about how she's worried that I am eating all day long, that I should stick to 3 meals a day and accept feeling hungry some times. I feel awful and so self-conscious that she is tracking what and when I eat. I do not look forward to going to work anymore, knowing I will be judged every time I go grab a meal.

## What is Chain Imitrex 600?

Chain Imitrex 600 is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users make smarter moves in the financial markets—especially crypto. It uses real-time data and advanced algorithms to scan the markets, identify profitable trades, and execute them on your behalf. So yeah, it’s kind of like having a digital trading assistant that doesn’t sleep.

Unlike some platforms that only focus on Bitcoin or a handful of coins, Chain Imitrex 600 offers **multi-asset support**, including forex and stocks. That means more flexibility and better opportunities to diversify. It’s web-based, so you don’t need to install anything, and the interface is surprisingly clean. No clutter, no nonsense.

## Who Created Chain Imitrex 600?

The creators of Chain Imitrex 600 aren’t exactly public figures, which is pretty normal in this space.

Think of it like the brains behind Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge—experienced folks, just not household names.

That being said, I wouldn’t mind more transparency here. I get that anonymity is common in crypto, but it’s always a plus when a company puts real faces behind their product. Still, the platform itself shows signs of being built by people who actually understand trading.

Basically, it’s designed to react faster than a human trader could, which is a big deal in volatile markets like crypto.

Hey r/HFY. Sharing my first story. Hope you enjoy it.

⸻

Morning

I woke up to sunlight on my face. The room smelled like earth and citrus. I could hear a bird tapping at the window. Out the window, towers were covered in thick green vines. Birds darted around, chasing each other. A neighbor was picking something orange and tossing it to a kid below. Everyone looked relaxed.

I tapped my wristband.
“Morning, Kiko. What’s the weather?”
“Clear. 22 degrees. Low humidity.”
I made coffee. I just stood there for a minute, looking out, thinking today might be different.

⸻

The Find

I met Leo at the café. It was warm inside. Plants climbed up the walls and over the menu board. Leo was already there, tracing lines on some old blueprints. He always gets fidgety when he’s onto something.

“You look excited,” I said.
“I found something,” he told me. He slid the papers over.
“It’s an old lab. Underground. From before the city changed. Not on any of the new maps.”

I checked the map. The street names were faded.
“There could be danger.”
Leo tapped the blueprint, not meeting my eyes. “If we get it working, we can boost power for the whole city.”

I thought about it. My hand shook a little as I picked up my mug. “Alright. I’m in.”

⸻

The Old City

We went to the old part of town at noon. Sun was hot. Plants had taken over everything. The street signs were gone, just vines and saplings. Leo used his pocket knife to cut away vines from a metal door. He grunted as he pulled it open. It scraped loud and echoed.

Inside was darker than I expected. It was cold, too. The air smelled like wet stone. We walked down stairs covered in moss. My boots slipped once and Leo reached back without looking. The floor was humming under us, steady and deep. I kept thinking, this place has been alive a long time without us.

⸻

The Reactor

We found a big room. Roots were coming down through a cracked glass dome overhead. Water dripped somewhere. Old gear was stacked on metal tables, most of it covered in dust. The hum was louder here. I felt it in my teeth.

A reactor stood in the center, still glowing a little. I stopped. My hands felt cold. My mind went blank for a second, thinking, if we mess this up, maybe the lights go out for everyone.

I reached out and touched the metal. It was warm.
“It’s working,” I said, voice quiet.

Leo was silent, just staring at the lights.
“We should be careful,” he said. “This is big, but it’s risky.”
He rubbed at a scar on his thumb. He does that when he’s nervous.

I nodded. My heart was pounding. I tried to breathe slow.

⸻

Trouble

Metal scraped overhead. Alarms went off. Red lights flashed. Old drones lifted up, sensors glowing. Dust fell off them as they moved.

“Run!” Leo yelled. He grabbed my hand. We ran. My shoes slipped on the moss. A drone buzzed past my head, close enough to make my ears ring.

I grabbed a tablet from a table as we ran past. Leo pulled me around a corner. We took the stairs two at a time and burst into sunlight. I was out of breath. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the tablet.

⸻

Back Home

At my place, I set the tablet down. My legs still felt weak. Kiko, my AI, floated up and scanned the tablet.

“Needs coffee,” Kiko said.

I almost laughed, but it came out more like a sigh. “Just start it up.”

Neighbors drifted in. Mrs. Lin from down the hall. Even Benny, the parrot, landed on the lamp and started yelling,
“Ancient tech! Intruders!”
Leo shrugged. “We’re careful, Benny.”

The tablet’s screen flickered on. It showed power data, moisture levels, network stuff I barely understood.
“It says energy goes up by 30%,” Leo said.
“But it moves water away from plant roots,” I said. My voice felt tight.
“This could kill everything we’ve grown.”

⸻

The Meeting

We took the tablet to the town hall. The place used to be a greenhouse. Now it’s benches, potted trees, old solar blinds half-working. Maria ran the meeting. Dr. Tran sat by the sensor readouts.

Maria: “This tech could help, but it could also wreck our crops.”

Leo: “We need the power. Our grid isn’t enough.”

Me: “If the plants dry out, we lose food. The terraces are all we’ve got.”

Dr. Tran: “Let’s test it on a small area. Use sensors. Watch it closely.”

Someone in the back: “What if we mess up? We all depend on these gardens.”

Maria looked around, quiet for a minute. “We’ll go slow. Data’s public. We all vote.”

People nodded, but nobody looked fully relaxed.

Testing

We picked a test garden. Set up sensors. Checked every hour. My stomach was in knots the whole first day.

Moisture dropped. Leaves wilted. Dr. Tran and I tweaked the settings. The vines perked up. Power increased. Nothing died.

At the next meeting, I said, “Test worked. We can try it in more places.”

People clapped, but some were still watching me close.

Hidden Code

A few weeks later, Leo came to my place at night. He looked tired.

“I found a hidden folder,” he said, sitting on my floor. “It’s weather control. Old code. Can change rain and wind. The company hid it.”

I stared at the screen. For a second I saw the gardens with no water, everything drying up.
“This could mess with the whole climate,” I said.

Leo just nodded, rubbing his thumb again.

⸻

Another Vote

We called another meeting.

Leo showed the code.
I said, “This isn’t just about energy. This can change everything. Rain, wind, the whole city.”
Dr. Tran said, “That’s too much power for one group.”

Someone in the crowd: “That’s how the old world fell apart.”
Another: “But what if we use it to help?”

Maria stood up. “We vote. No secret code. No climate control. Everything is public. We all decide together.”

People agreed. Some looked relieved. Some looked worried. No one left early.

⸻

Months Later

Gardens grew. Power stayed up. No disasters. Every month we met to check data, just like we said we would.

One night, I was watering the vines on my balcony. Leo came out with two mugs. He looked tired but lighter.

“We made the right call,” he said.

I nodded. “Yeah. We did.”

Dr. Tran spoke at a conference a few weeks later. She said, “Old tech can help if you share data and stay honest.”

City lights blinked on. The stars were out. I looked out over the gardens. The wind smelled like green things growing. For the first time in a while, I felt proud of what we built.

Since i started university i started to realize how much my friends moms care about them, and no, my mom doesn't hate me, she cares a lot about me, but not in the way i would want. 
i don't know why, but my parents think that the way they need to show me love is buying me things, gifting me money, they always complain on how ""expensive"" i am (we are not rich, we are middle class in an third world country) but the last thing i would want is them reminding me of something i didn't ask for, i didn't ask for anything of that. I just need to say that they love me, that i matter. I think im a bit jealous of my older brother, they would always brag that he was in university, my dad even shared a photo of them together on his first day. On my first day i went alone, i don't even remember if someone congratulated me. I remember on how they would ask him about his day, but just a few days ago i told my mom i had things to do, i spent the whole day studying, i went to eat with a new friend, i started volunteering on a NGO, and did a lot of things, i went home thinking of telling my mom about my day but she just complained about her work, everyday she just complains on how tired she is and we have to listen to her, i started counting the days that she didn't ask about my day or asked me anything, and i lost count. I hate feeling invisible in my own house, i try to study the hardest and get good grades and they don't even care, it would be okay if they acted equally with my brother, but maybe it's just me, they are used to me being the one caring for everyone. I don't remember the last time when my mom said that she loved me, when i search in my phone she had just said it on a couple birthdays, and everyday i hear it, my friends say it to their moms and they say it back, i know its a pretty stupid thing to ask for, i always have food to eat, i have a bed, and a pretty relaxed life, but it is really worth it? I don't want any luxuries or expensive clothes, i want my parents to say that they love me and that they are proud of me, to my mom say that she loves me, to someone to ask me about my day, to hug me, to give me a cup of coffee when im studying until midnight.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

I love him, and I want him to be O.K. I want him to get help and I want him to get better. But I don’t know whether I can keep doing this anymore. He doesn’t have a job, doesn’t have a car or even his license, and isn’t really doing all that much with his life presently. I’m still in school, and I’m living at home, and although I’ve got a lot of my own stuff going on like insomnia, depression, an ED that I’m trying to manage I for some reason have become the person who carries both of our emotional weight like, all the time. I feel like now I’m more his mom or therapist than his girlfriend.

He has such bad mood swings and anger problems. Every other day, I feel like there's a new issue. One of the worst times was a few days before our second anniversary. We had gone out to get coffee with my friend and were having a good day after not seeing each other for a while. Then we got into a fight because he watched our show without me. Yeah, I know it sounds dumb, but I was kinda hurt and felt like ""I see how it is"". Rather than just talking about it, he spiraled and started saying things like “I’m a bad boyfriend” and guilt-tripping me. And then he said he was breaking up with me. Then, a couple of hours later asked me to forget he had said that. The same night, he went for a walk alone, scared the hell out of me and my friends because he has a history of SH. We were honestly afraid he was going to do something really bad. It was terrifying. I called his friends, told them to keep him company, and to make sure he was safe. After that emotionally exhausting night, I dumped him officially a few days after that because I just couldn’t take it anymore. But then he made all these promises about how he was going to get better, how he would work on himself, and I believed him because why wouldn't I? I love him. I really do care. But now it’s like we’re in the same cycle again. And I don’t know what to do now.

I don’t know, I just feel like if I go, I’ll be why he gets any worse. But if I stay, it's gonna slowly kill my own mental health even more. I’m working through my own stuff, and I never catch a break. I want him to be all right. I wish I could be the one to help him get better, but I’m not sure I can do that anymore, or if I could even do enough, and that kills me. My friends tell me I should go and prioritize myself.

Im a 50 year old white mal,  married (complicated) father. In late November 2024 I was on a dental  a dental reddit. I was on looking for a temporary glue to fix a crown til I could get to the dentist. The only person to answer was a 26 year old female claiming to be a dental assist/hygienist. We talked about the glue, that moved to dental procedures, that moved to us chatting on WhatsApp, by January we were texting freely over our phones. It was fairly innocent, some light flirting here and there initially. I was talking with a cute (from what I could gather from not great thumbnails) 26 year old girl and it was fun. We talked about cats, movies, music, all your general stuff. Somewhere we started talking about our relationships. I told her about my marriage and where it was going. She told me a little bits of past relationships. After that things picked up a bit and we got more flirty and chatty. We still haven't spoken or met at this point. I wasn't thinking to much of it because it was just talk and I thought the likelihood of anything becoming of all of it slim especially do to the age gap. She wasnt hounding or asking for anything and chatting with her was nice and we were texting a lot, pretty much any waking hour we would text. In mid February I figured id ask if she'd like to meet for coffee or whatever. Im older but im tall, in good shape, and people have called me handsome. Maybe she's interested in me I thought. Shes seen pictures of me and was still being flirty, so why not. As soon as I asked her things started getting odd. She immediately said yes, then maybe, then idk, then yes again. Within a couple days of asking she all of a sudden wanted to talk on the phone. That was the first time we spoke, it wasnt a long call. She has a soft voice, kinda breathy. But she mainly sounded but shaky and scared. I figured she was going to tell me about a bf, or a husband, or kids. She went right in to telling me that she was born male, and had been transitioning for a few years. She had started hrt and blockers a few times but had to stop several times because of money and insurance, but had been on everything steady for nearly the past year. She breifly talked about a few medical procedures she had but all were minor, nothing on the bottom or top. She did most of the talking but started shifting from sad, to a matter of fact serious tone, to mad. My hesitation and mild confusion seemed to up set her and she hung up me. The next couple days she'd text something snarky, or say something rude, or accuse me of wanting or thinking something. I was confused and didnt know what to say but I really hadn't said much. I thought at first she said she was a male just to get me to leave, but then she'd keep texting. One thing led to another and we ended up fighting and didnt chat much for the next week. Then  the day I had mentioned to meet up came and I texted her ""so are we meeting up or not"" not thinking id get an answer or not. Not sure why I asked that, guess I wanted to see how she was. She immediately texted back yes. We ended up meeting a week later, after she stood me up once. To be honest I wasnt sure what to expect in person. Since then we've met a couple times a week. We've even spent a couple weekends together. Shes very private and shy. She gets up set and crys easily. Shes constantly holding my hand anytime she's able which is still a bit odd for me still. Shes met my daughter and she's taken me to she her shrink a couple times to. She calls her her new mom bc she doesn't speak to her mom any more. We really enjoy our time together and it feels like things could naturally go somewhere but that really hasn't been talked about. Im wanting to describe her more but dont want to cross a line. I dont know all the terms and whats the right or wrong thing to say. Ive only spoken or been with one transgender person and i wouldnt call her in the loop of all things trans. And she doesn't correct me if I get something wrong like a procedure, an acronym used to describe a person, medication or anything else. So if a say something wrong cut me some slack. 

I love being with her and we both look forward to seeing each other. Shes said that im the only person shes been with since she started the transition. Im not sure where we really stand. Shes very unpredictable. Sometimes well plan something and she'll cancel to stay at home. She likes going out but never where a lot of ppl are. She loves tea, she has one for everything. She loves smoking weed and is very sexual sometimes too much. Shes been on hrt and blockers for about a year now if not more, and they have done what youd expected. Shes had her adams apple shaved and a few laser hair treatments. Nothing else. We've talked about breasts and shes waiting to see what the hrt does. She definitely has boobs but I know she wants them bigger then the hrt will probably give her. Downstairs, i think shes keeping it. Originally she wanted a vagioplasty but has since kind of changed her mind a couple times and I guess it doesn't bother me much if shes happy. At this point im fine bc it took me a bit to figure out how to work with what shes got to her benefit.

I dont know whats going on a lot bc she doesn't talk much about it with me. And i feel uncomfortable just saying what ive said so far. I move from happy, to confusion, to doubt bc her moods can be all over. Im not sure what normal is. Im not sure it this is stable. I need help figuring out where we stand and whats going on",1,1752222365.0,asktransgender,2,1.0,False

Was going down a rabbit hole on GitHub and found something pretty cool I had to share. It's a pair of open-source projects from the same team (TEN-framework) that seem to tackle two of the biggest reasons why talking to AI still feels so clunky.

For those who don't know, TEN has a whole open-source framework for building voice agents, and it looks like they're now adding these killer components specifically to solve the 'human interaction' part of the problem.

The first is the **awkward silence**. You know, that half-second lag after you stop talking that just kills the flow. They built a tool called **TEN VAD** to solve this. It's a Voice Activity Detector that's incredibly fast and lightweight (the model is just 306KB). This also makes interruptions feel completely natural. It hears you the instant you open your mouth, so you can cut the AI off mid-thought, just like you would with a friend.

But then there's the second, even trickier problem: the AI interrupting you, or not knowing when it's actually your turn to talk. This is where their other project, **TEN Turn Detection**, comes in.

This isn't just about detecting sound; it's about understanding intent. It uses a language model to figure out if you've actually **finished** a thought (""Where can I find a good coffee shop?""), if you've **paused** but want to continue (""I have a question about... uh...""), or if you've told it to just **wait** (""Hold on a sec"").

This lets the AI be a much better listener, it can handle interruptions gracefully and knows when to wait for you to finish your sentence.

The best part? Both projects are well-documented, and seem built to work together. The VAD handles the ""when,"" and the Turn Detection handles the ""what now?""

It feels like a really smart, layered approach to making human-AI conversations feel less like a transaction and more like, well, a conversation.

Feeling a little lonely I hope someone reads this out there


Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

Reach out. I’d really love to hear from you.",1,1752222266.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

In the fifth year of our marriage, Damon Austin set his sights on an ice-cold goddess.

To win her favor, my husband started giving me pure gold roses.

With each rose he gave me, my love for him would be drained away and transferred to her, making her fall deeper in love with him.

But he didn't know that once all my love was extracted, my feelings for him would disappear completely.

So when he gave me the ninety-ninth rose, I asked for a divorce.

He scoffed dismissively. ""You want to divorce me just because I gave you roses?""

I looked at him with a blank expression, like I was staring at a stranger, and said flatly, ""No. It's because I don't love you anymore.""

When I said this, Damon Austin acted like he'd heard the world's biggest joke.

The contempt in his eyes deepened. ""Scarlett, I've told you before—I just enjoy the thrill of bringing down women who think they're above everyone else. I don't love her. I'll get bored of her soon enough.""

""I was planning to dump her and come back to our family in a month, but since you're being unreasonable again today, I'll extend it another three months. If you keep making a scene, I'll keep extending the time I spend with her.""

After half a year, hearing his shameless words again, my heart felt nothing—not even a ripple.

Half a year ago, when Damon gave me the first pure gold rose, he and Amara Clark barely knew each other.

Back then, she was proud and alluring, looking down on everyone.

Women like that always triggered men's desire to conquer them.

So when I found out Damon was giving me love-transferring golden roses to win her favor, I went completely insane and smashed our entire house.

I cried desperately, asking him over and over: ""Damon, is being faithful really that hard for you?""

Faced with my breakdown, Damon remained like a detached spectator, his eyes showing no emotion.

After hearing my words, he stayed silent for a long time before sighing: ""Scarlett, I love you deeply, but don't you think our life is too peaceful? What's the difference between a life without excitement and being dead?""

He earnestly promised me, saying firmly: ""Scarlett, don't worry. No matter how I play around with other women, you'll always be my number one. You're the only one I love.""

The second time he gave me a rose, afraid I'd be upset, he bought me the latest designer bag.

He took me to see the first spectacular fireworks show of my life.

Back then he said: ""Scarlett, just wait a little longer. Once I'm done playing with her, we'll have a child. I'll be a good husband and father—I'll never let you suffer again.""

The third time he gave me one, he casually had his assistant deliver a randomly purchased LV necklace.

He told me: ""Work's keeping me busy, I don't have time to spend with you. If you need anything, contact my assistant directly.""

Then he turned around and took Amara to Antarctica to see the aurora, kissing her passionately under the northern lights.

But he didn't know that as his relationship with Amara heated up, my love for him was gradually fading away.

Now, Amara had fallen in love with him and couldn't live without him.

But I had forgotten what I was like when I used to love him.

At this moment, I looked up at the familiar yet strange man before me, composed myself, and said: ""I'm serious, Damon. I don't love you anymore. Let's get div—""

""Enough! Are you angry because I didn't spend your birthday with you last month? I've explained it countless times—I was too busy with work and forgot. Didn't I buy you tons of gifts to make up for it? How long are you going to keep this tantrum going?""

Before I could finish, he interrupted me with fury blazing in his voice.

But he'd forgotten that on my birthday, his trip home to meet Amara's parents had been posted online and became a trending topic.

Looking at him—full of lies without a single truthful word—I said coolly: ""Damon, don't make me regret ever knowing you.""

Chapter 2

Originally, I was the one who pursued Damon.

Back then, I was the most unremarkable among all his admirers.

Compared to his other pursuers, I was plain-looking, ordinarily capable, and from a modest family background.

Nobody around us expected that someone as picky as him would end up choosing me.

Many people said he picked me because he'd seen too many beautiful women and developed aesthetic fatigue.

But only I knew the truth.

He chose me simply because I was obedient enough, compliant enough.

He never considered that my obedience and compliance came from loving him enough to accept everything about him.

Before, when I loved him, I would unconditionally forgive him no matter what he did.

But now, I suddenly felt some regret—regret for ever knowing him in the first place.

Hearing my words, Damon's eyes flashed with bewilderment.

He seemed to have never imagined I would say such things to him.

""Scarlett, what gives you the right to say that to me? Have you forgotten that you were the one who pursued me first, and I—""

Before he could finish, Amara called.

Except it wasn't his phone ringing—it was mine.

Right in front of him, I answered the call.

The next moment, Amara's icy voice came through the phone.

""Tell Damon I'm waiting for him downstairs.""

She hung up immediately, giving me no chance to refuse.

This wasn't the first time she'd made me relay messages to Damon.

The first time she called, I didn't answer and didn't tell Damon.

That night, she got into a car accident.

Her left leg was completely shattered.

When he found out, he not only gave her the anniversary gift he'd prepared for me, but also didn't come home for half a month straight.

He didn't even send a single message.

Later, when I confronted him heartbroken, he said dismissively: ""If you'd answered her call that day, she wouldn't have gotten into the accident. You're the reason she almost lost her leg—what's wrong with giving her some gifts as compensation?""

Snapping back to reality, I relayed Amara's message to him.

""She's waiting for you downstairs now. You should hurry down—don't keep her waiting.""

I stood up indifferently and handed him his jacket from the couch.

Seeing this, Damon seemed momentarily stunned.

Usually when Amara called to summon him back, I would throw a huge tantrum.

I would threaten him dramatically.

If he walked out that door, he shouldn't bother coming back.

Though he had never once stopped for me.

Now, not knowing what he was thinking, contempt flashed in his eyes as he sneered: ""Keep up this act. Sooner or later, you'll be begging me to come back.""

With that, he roughly grabbed his jacket and walked out the door without looking back.

I paid no attention, turning to go back to the bedroom to pack my luggage.

He didn't know that the moment I decided on divorce, I had already bought a plane ticket to France.

Soon after, just as I was putting clothes into my suitcase, my best friend Lily suddenly called.

As soon as I picked up, I heard her indignant voice.

""Scarlett, Damon is such a scumbag! He's actually having car sex with someone in your car by the roadside! I just saw it and thought you were in the car, so I went to knock on the window... I can't take it—just thinking about that scene makes me want to go blind.""

As she spoke, she sent me the photos she'd taken.

In the picture, a shirtless Damon was protectively holding a woman with an unnaturally flushed face, his expression dark.

They seemed to have just reached a passionate moment, pressed together like conjoined twins.

But I noticed the car they were using was the first gift he'd given me in our first year of marriage.

I looked at it silently, my heart completely calm.

As if the people in the photo had nothing to do with me.

I looked away and said coolly to comfort her: ""Don't be angry. I'll be divorcing him soon. Whoever he's with has nothing to do with me.""

Chapter 3

After I said this, Lily was absolutely stunned, asking repeatedly: ""How did you suddenly become so enlightened? Are you serious or are you lying to me?""

""It's real. I've already asked him for a divorce.""

A marriage without love is like scattered sand—it falls apart at the slightest breeze.

So regardless of whether he agrees or not, I'm determined to get this divorce.

Realizing my resolve, Lily was overjoyed.

However, I never expected Amara to contact me again the next day.

She asked me to meet at a café outside the mall.

As soon as we met, she cut straight to the chase, brazenly saying: ""I don't want to be a mistress. You should divorce Damon.""

If this had been before, I definitely would have lashed out at her.

But now, I took a light sip of my coffee and asked calmly: ""If you don't want to be a mistress, why don't you break up with him?""

Amara laughed softly, speaking with a smug tone: ""Because I love him, and he loves me too.""

Hearing this, I laughed inappropriately.

During all these years with Damon, this was the line I'd heard most often.

Every woman who'd had a fling with him thought they were truly in love.

Including me.

I once naively thought I was different in his heart.

I did everything perfectly, taking care of him with meticulous attention.

I tried to earn his love with my sincerity, hoping to grow old together and live a loving life.

Only later did I understand that he was selfish—he loved no one but himself.

I opened my mouth, about to say something to her, when I saw Damon storm into the café from outside.

Like a protective eagle, he urgently shielded Amara behind him.

His sharp, hawk-like black eyes stared at me with vigilant warning.

""Scarlett, yesterday you threatened me with divorce, then had your friend take photos, and now you're secretly meeting with Amara behind my back. What exactly are you trying to do?""

Hearing the word ""divorce,"" Amara's eyes flashed with hidden anticipation as she asked excitedly: ""Really? Damon, are you getting divorced?""

Hearing this, Damon's body stiffened slightly.

But when he noticed my gaze, mockery appeared in his eyes as he put his arm around her waist and said softly: ""Of course. How could a woman like her—with no figure and no looks—be worthy of me?""

As he spoke, he deliberately shot me a challenging look.

I nodded in agreement.

I said sincerely: ""Yes, only someone like Miss Clark—tall, beautiful, and stunning—could be worthy of the handsome and charming Mr. Austin.""

I thought I was complimenting them both.

But I didn't understand why Damon's expression grew even darker after I said this.

He left with Amara without saying another word to me.

I wanted to ask him when we could go prepare for the divorce.

I sent the message, but received a glaring red exclamation mark.

Once again, just like before, whenever he got upset, he would block me and delete all my contact information.

Every time, I would swallow my pride and beg him to remove me from his blacklist.

Now, I quietly followed his example and deleted all his contact information.

From the moment I stopped loving him, I would never coax him again.

If he cared about me even a little bit, he would have noticed when he gave me the tenth golden rose that I had long stopped caring about him.",1,1752221932.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I am 24 M looking to find like minded people.

I’ve spent most of my life in boarding schools, followed by my undergraduate, studying abroad. As a result, I’ve become really good at starting friendships… and equally bad at sustaining them. Add to that the fact that a few close friends recently moved away, and I’m now on a mission (trying and failing) to actually build something consistent — friendships, community, or just a familiar face to rant about TV shows, Movies, Sports or Politics with.

A little about me:

I’m a big pop culture nerd. Currently watching Daredevil: Born Again and White Lotus.

I’m always exploring new music; I’ll go from jazz to techno to moody indie in the same playlist. Books, poetry and  literature, is something that I can’t get enough of. These days I am also exploring museums and art galleries.

I also love walking and running around Delhi. Nehru Park and Lodhi Gardens are my go to places. If you see someone running at ungodly hours that would be me. I play tennis and I am trying to get into more strength training.

If any of this resonates with you and you are also looking for new people to hang out with, let’s connect.

It doesn’t have to be anything formal, a walk followed by coffee (can be replaced by beer given the time of the day).

Looking forward to hearing from and hopefully meeting some amazing people.",1,1752221927.0,southdelhi,1,0.67,False

When I told Daxon Sterling I wanted to break up, he was still fiddling with his camera, taking photos of me.

""Just because I posted her on my Instagram?""

""Yeah.""

He squinted through the viewfinder, smiling as he asked:

""How long this time? A week or two? Don't drag it out too long, or I might actually forget about you.""

Eleven years of knowing each other, and he didn't believe for a second that I'd actually leave him.

But this time, I'd really made up my mind.

So, when he was assuming I'd go to NYU with him, I chose somewhere as far away as possible—Stanford University.

From here on out, we were to live completely separate lives, never crossing paths again.

...

In the coffee shop, the camera shutter clicked crisply. Daxon looked down at the screen, checking the shot he'd just taken of me, and chuckled softly.

""I'm gonna use these photos at our wedding someday. Already got the album title picked out: 'My Hot-Tempered Wife Who Broke Up with Me a Hundred Times.'""

I kept my face stone-cold, not in the mood for his jokes.

""Ugh, why can't I ever capture that vibe when I shoot you? The other day I casually snapped a few pics of Aria and they looked like magazine covers.""

He clearly wasn't taking my breakup seriously.

""I'm being serious this time.""

He looked up at me, the smile fading from his face.

""You're really gonna break up with me just because I posted her on Instagram? Come on, Skylar, isn't that a bit much?""

""No, it's not.""

Of course it wasn't too much.

Daxon had used the $3,000 Canon R6 I'd bought him to shoot graduation photos for our classmates, then posted them on Instagram—a whole carousel of nothing but Aria's close-ups.

Everyone was gushing about how he'd captured Aria looking so pure and ethereal, and he even hyped up her ""unique aura"" in the comments.

My photos? He didn't save a single raw file.

All because he thought I didn't have good camera presence, that I couldn't produce any standout shots.

""Okay, jealous much? How about I take a bunch more of you and post those on my Instagram too?""

His tone was like he was pacifying some unreasonable kid.

I took a deep breath.

""You don't get it. I don't want your Instagram posts.""

""Got it, got it. Look, I'll delete the post, okay? Problem solved?""

I shook my head, done with his whole ""playing dumb"" act.

""You're deleting the post? Could you maybe send me the raw files first?"" Aria had appeared out of nowhere at our coffee shop table, sliding into the seat next to us without even asking.

She immediately picked up on the weird tension and asked, ""What's wrong? Daxon, did you piss off Skylar again?""

Daxon pursed his lips but didn't say anything.

Aria jumped right into damage control mode.

""Skylar, don't be mad at him. It's totally my fault—I was the one who asked Daxon to take extra shots of me that day. I haven't had a proper photo shoot in forever.""

She tugged at Daxon's sleeve.

""You know what? Keep the raw files. Delete the Instagram post too, dude. No point in upsetting your girlfriend over something this small.""

I let out a bitter laugh. ""Something small? Having my boyfriend photograph you is small? Using matching phone cases with my boyfriend is small? Sneaking around and changing my boyfriend's wallpaper to your photo is also small? Aria, I seriously don't get it—how is it that every single 'small thing' that pisses me off has you right in the middle of it?""

""Since you're so into my boyfriend, he's all yours.""

Aria bit her lip, tears welling up in her eyes.

""I'm sorry,"" she said, reluctantly taking off her phone case. ""You're misunderstanding Daxon. We're really not what you think. I don't have parents anymore, no family left. Daxon's family is all I have.""

She set down the phone case as tears started streaming down her face.

Daxon shot me a reproachful look.

""If you've got beef with me, take it up with me. She didn't do anything wrong. Why are you taking it out on her?""

Looking at him pick up the phone case and stuff it back into Aria's hands, even reluctantly giving her hand a little squeeze—

I suddenly felt completely over it all.

Chapter 2

I got up and left the coffee shop. I didn't want to stick around and listen to Daxon comfort her.

Never thought there'd come a day when even our breakup would feel this half-assed.

That night, friends had organized a murder mystery game. I didn't want to make things awkward for everyone because of the breakup, so I sucked it up and went.

When I got to the door, I was a few minutes late. I could hear my friends inside complaining about me.

""Is Skylar gonna bail because she's pissed again? What did you guys even fight about this time?""

""Same old thing—that Instagram post.""

Someone laughed dismissively. ""She's seriously mad about that? You're president of the photography club at our school. What's the big deal about taking some photos and posting them? Skylar's being way too petty.""

""Right? Last time we played murder mystery, Daxon got paired with someone else for the couple's storyline and she got so pissed we couldn't even finish the game.""

""If I were looking for a girlfriend, I'd want someone sweet and chill, not someone who's always blowing up. Like, Aria's perfect.""

Daxon sighed.

""Can't help it, that's just how she is. Guess I've been spoiling her too much.""

Someone laughed. ""You keep spoiling her like that, and she'll get so bratty no one else will want her. Then she'll be stuck with you forever. Let's see how you handle that.""

A soft, gentle voice drifted from inside the room.

""Skylar's so lucky though. If someone pampered me like that, I'd never want to fight with them.""

So Aria was there too.

Daxon's friends immediately started egging them on. ""Well then, let's give you two the couple's storyline tonight.""

""Really? Can I pick one where Daxon confesses to me and we have all those cute interactions?"" she asked playfully.

Then I heard Daxon respond with a laugh in his voice.

""Alright!""

Then Daxon warned everyone:

""You guys better not go blabbing about this, or my little jealousy queen will throw another fit.""

I let go of the door handle and walked away.

The laughter from the room behind me sounded so sharp and piercing.

Daxon knew perfectly well that I had a problem with him playing romantic storylines with other girls.

He'd pay lip service to worrying about me getting mad, but he never actually turned other girls down. Simply because he was dead certain that no matter how angry I got, I'd never actually break up with him.

This time though, he was wrong.

That night, Aria posted on Instagram.

\[First time playing murder mystery—turns out growing old together is such a romantic thing. Thanks for healing me tonight with just one evening. I used to think there was nothing left in this world worth living for, but now I have a dream I want to chase.\]

The photo was a group shot—in an inconspicuous corner, two hands were interlocked.

I scrolled through the screen and saw Daxon's comment.

\[Don't be so pessimistic. There's still so much beauty in this world waiting for us.\]

I locked my phone and knocked on my dad's office door.

""Dad, I want to apply to Stanford University.""

He stopped working, closed his laptop, and gestured for me to sit down and talk.

""What made you suddenly change your mind? I thought you were set on going to NYU with that Sterling boy.""

""Dad, isn't your firm expanding to Palo Alto? I want to be closer to you. Also, I really love beaches there.""

Dad could see the disappointment written all over my face, but he didn't call me out on it.

""I support you completely. Putting your future first is never wrong. I was actually worried about you being so far from me for the first time in your life—wasn't sure I could handle it. Now I'm totally at peace with it.""

Looking at my dad's adoring expression, I knew I was making the right choice.

Chapter 3

The day after SATs results came out, I submitted my application online and quickly got an interview notification for the end of the month.

It wasn't until I got the text reminder that I remembered I'd bought tickets to the Daido Moriyama photography exhibition—Daxon's favorite photographer.

He hadn't managed to snag tickets when they went on sale, so I'd quietly bought two at marked-up prices online.

I'd planned to surprise him after graduation, but now there was no point.

So I took a photo and posted on Instagram: \[One ticket to give away, first come first serve.\]

An avatar I'd never talked to before popped up.

""These tickets were so hard to get! Could I have it?""

It took me a while to remember that it was Kieran Wilde from Daxon's photography club. He had a great physique and was always being used as a model by the club members.

An hour later, I met Kieran in person at the exhibition entrance—he was really tall, with deep brown eyes and curly hair, looking pretty sweet.

Several girls walking by kept turning back to look at him, some clearly working up the courage to ask for his number.

He didn't talk much, but when he encountered pieces he liked, he couldn't help sharing insights about Moriyama's style and the background of various works.

Listening to him explain everything, I realized for the first time how fascinating photography could be.

""Can I take a photo of you?"" he suddenly asked. ""This lighting and angle—it's perfect for you!""

I felt kinda shy but didn't want to kill his vibe.

""Look!"" He held the camera up to my face. ""Isn't this so moody?""

""Your profile's gorgeous. Can I try a front-facing shot? Let me find the right lighting.""

The second he picked up that camera, he got all serious.

And I loved every single shot he took.

Something suddenly hit me—Daxon hadn't been this patient with my photos in forever.

After we finished the exhibition, I asked him to send me the photos. Before we parted ways, I asked, ""Can I post these on Instagram?""

""Of course,"" he grinned, his whole face lighting up. ""Can I post them too?""

""Totally.""

As I was turning to leave, he suddenly called out, ""Hey, thanks for bringing me today. Let me take you to dinner next time, yeah?""

I nodded without even thinking.

One the way home, I picked out a few photos to post on Instagram.

I remembered the first time I met Daxon—he had a camera in his hands too.

Back then, I was only seven, Mom had just passed away, and Dad was drowning in grief. Sometimes he'd just sit at home all day, completely zoned out, no bandwidth for me at all.

I didn't dare cry at home—I was afraid it would make Dad even more heartbroken. I could only squat alone in the neighborhood garden, watching ants move while wiping away my tears.

Daxon poked his head out from behind his kiddie camera and handed me a candy.

""Don't cry, okay? You look way prettier when you smile.""

From then on, he'd always drag me along to photograph dewdrops and flowers.

When Dad couldn't deal with me, he'd bring me to his house for dinner.

Seven-year-old Daxon asked me, ""Skylar, will you be my exclusive model? When I grow up, I'll throw you your own exhibition.""

I nodded like I sort of got it, letting him pull me around for photos.

From then on, every birthday, he'd take commemorative photos of me.

But on my 17th birthday, he didn't—

That day, Daxon's mom's best friend died in a car accident. Before she passed, she'd entrusted her teenage daughter to her.

From that same day on, I lost my annual birthday photos and lost all the special treatment I used to get from Daxon.

The phone ringing snapped me back to reality.

Daxon's voice was pissed off.

""Skylar, enough already. Kieran posted all those photos of you—what do you think that makes me look like?""

""What?""

""Don't play dumb. I gotta hand it to him though, he's really playing along with your little act. Guy's literally the campus heartthrob—who's gonna believe he's actually into you?""

I had no clue what Daxon was talking about. I put him on speaker and scrolled through Instagram.

Turns out Kieran had posted nine photos of me with the caption:

\[In light and time, you are the most special existence.\]

""It's just a few photos on Instagram. Daxon, isn't that a bit much?""

Listening to the long silence on the other end of the phone, I just felt like it was ridiculous—guess he finally knew how it felt.

""Daxon, can you help me with my dress zipper? I can't reach it."" A sweet female voice came from the other end of the phone.

I chuckled. ""Better go—can't let Aria catch cold.""",2,1752221884.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

At 2 a.m., with the final clip loading, it froze. My heart sank. I closed my eyes, sighed, and gently tapped the keyboard—like you’d pat a friend’s shoulder. “C’mon, just a little longer,” I muttered. And weirdly? It unfroze.

Seven years into their marriage, Jessica Rolando discovered her husband Quentin Atlante had a six-year-old son.

She crouched behind the slides at the kindergarten, watching Quentin bend down to scoop up a little boy, playing with him cheerfully.

""Daddy, you haven't come to see me in sooooo long,"" the child complained.

Quentin ruffled the boy's hair. ""Sorry, buddy. Daddy's been swamped at work. Be good for Mommy, alright?""

Jessica froze on the spot instantly, her mind went completely blank.

Daddy? Mommy?

Quentin and child stood there together, their faces strikingly similar.

Everything screamed the brutal truth: the man who'd sworn he'd love her forever had been cheating on her all along.

They'd been childhood sweethearts, together for over a decade. Jessica had once taken a knife to the stomach saving Quentin's life, the attack leaving her not only childless but unable to ever have kids.

Back then, Quentin had knelt beside her hospital bed, eyes red with tears: ""Screw having kids—I don't want anyone else. You're everything I need, Jess!""

His trembling voice still echoed in her memory, yet the scene before her now shattered that promise into a million pieces.

Jessica stumbled backward, her heart feeling like it was being carved up by razor blades, torn into countless bleeding fragments.

She couldn't bear to watch anymore. She was terrified she'd march over there and confront Quentin, even more terrified of breaking down like some pathetic fool and being rejected.

She turned and fled.

At the kindergarten entrance, her best friend Betty Laiperze had been waiting by her SUV. Seeing Jessica's ashen face, Betty immediately jumped out. ""Jesus, Jess! What's wrong?""

""Nosh said you forgot something and went back to get it. What the hell happened?""

Nosh was Betty's son, and it was Betty who had dragged Jessica along to today's parent-teacher conference.

Jessica's face was chalk-white, tears burning behind her eyes. ""Betty, I need you to run a background check on someone.""

""Who?""

""Quentin Atlante..."" Her throat constricted as she forced out the words in a hoarse whisper. ""He has a son.""

...

【Baby, just one more week and I'll be home. Missing me yet?】

Jessica stared at Quentin's text, tears streaming down her face like a dam had burst.

Every July for the past six years, he'd disappear for two weeks on some ""business trip"" to check on their overseas branches.

Six whole years, and she'd never questioned it. Not once.

Reality had just bitch-slapped her hard, laughing at what a complete idiot she'd been.

Quentin wasn't on any damn business trip—he was playing house with his mistress and their kid!

If she hadn't stumbled onto this nightmare today, she'd probably still be living in la-la land.

Jessica kept torturing herself, flipping through the photos on her phone. Rain pounded against the windows while lightning lit up the sky, casting shadows across her ghostly pale face.

Maybe she should've seen this coming.

The Atlante family was old-school traditional—no way in hell would they let some barren woman hold the title of Mrs. Atlante.

Unless they'd orchestrated this whole thing from the start.

So what role had her so-called devoted husband been playing all along?

Jessica felt like her heart was being fed through a paper shredder. She and Quentin had been inseparable since childhood—everyone always said they were meant to be together forever.

When she was eight, she'd fallen out of their backyard oak tree. He'd thrown himself underneath her, breaking his arm, then smiled through the pain saying it was ""no big deal.""

At twelve, when she got her first period and stained her dress, even though he knew what was happening, he'd still freaked out and sobbed that he'd ""die if anything happened to her.""

At eighteen, he'd secretly entered some underground street race, nearly getting himself killed to win a ring just to propose to her.

He'd said: ""Jess, I'm gonna love you forever.""

Teenage love burns so pure and fierce—it had completely captured her heart.

Then just right before their wedding, his enemies had kidnapped her, holding her for three hellish days. When they found her, she was barely breathing.

Quentin had gotten three ribs broken trying to save her, and that's when she'd taken a knife meant for him, losing her chance to ever be a mother.

When Quentin's mother Laurel Flores found out, she'd definitely tried to break them up.

But Quentin, still covered in bruises, had knelt in the family chapel for three days on a hunger strike, declaring: ""I'd rather lose the Atlante name than lose Jess."" Finally forcing his mother to back down.

After they healed, they'd gotten married quickly. All of New York had witnessed their epic love story.

But in the end, he'd still betrayed her.

Her phone buzzed. The screen read ""Hubby""—how fucking ironic.

Jessica numbly swiped to answer. His warm voice came through: ""Hey babe, you eating real meals while I'm gone? Missing me?""

Before, she would've melted into those sweet words, desperate to tell him how much she missed him.

But now... she was terrified that if she spoke, she'd break down completely.

""Babe? Something wrong? Don't be scared—I'll catch the next flight home to be with you right now!""

Quentin's voice turned frantic—she could hear him moving around, probably grabbing his wallet and keys.

But Jessica couldn't bear to see him right now.

""I'm fine."" She was fighting to keep it together, but her voice came out rough and broken. ""Seriously, don't ditch work for me. Just fighting off a cold or something.""

This was the first time she'd ever lied to Quentin.

He didn't seem to notice, apparently distracted by something on his end, but still fussed over her: ""Alright, but get some sleep, yeah? Call me if you need anything, okay? Don't make me worry.""

Jessica managed a weak ""Mm-hmm.""

She was about to hang up when she heard a woman's sultry voice in the background: ""Quentin, Carter's finally asleep. Now we can...""

She caught the sharp intake of his breath before the line went dead.

Jessica's knuckles went white as she gripped the phone, ice spreading through her veins.

He was with that bitch right now... She couldn't let herself think about what they were doing.

A broken whimper escaped her throat—a sound completely beyond her control, like someone had reached into her chest and was crushing her heart with their bare hands.

She'd tried to convince herself maybe Quentin was just trapped in this impossible situation because of the kid.

But now it was crystal clear—he was a willing participant.

Betty must have heard her losing it because she burst through the door, then froze when she saw Jessica's hollow expression. For once, Betty—who never hesitated about anything—didn't know what to do.

""Jess, no man is worth destroying yourself over.""

Tears splashed onto the photos in Jessica's lap, each drop echoing in the silence.

Betty's heart shattered. She pulled Jessica into her arms, voice shaking with rage: ""That son of a bitch! Quentin is such a piece of shit!""

""All those pretty promises when he proposed to you, and now he's got the balls to keep a side chick and bastard behind your back.""

Jessica closed her eyes, letting the tears fall freely. She'd already made her decision about what came next...

Chapter 2

The next morning dawned bright and clear after the storm.

Jessica hadn't slept a damn minute.

She'd spent the entire night thinking—she'd experienced love in its purest form, so how could she settle for this fake bullshit?

She was Jessica Rolando who loved Quentin with everything she had, but she was also Jessica Rolando, daughter of the Rolando family. And she didn't play second fiddle to anyone.

Mind made up, she called her father Dexter: ""Dad, remember how you wanted to expand into the UK market? Betty's husband has ties to British royalty, and she's taking Nosh back there in two weeks. I want to go with them and scope things out.""

Dexter sounded confused: ""Quentin put you up to this?""

""Nope, this is my call."" Jessica let out a bitter laugh. Everyone automatically assumed she and Quentin were joined at the hip—even her own father.

Dexter was clearly surprised. His daughter had never wanted to be away from that Atlante boy for more than a day, so why the sudden interest in traveling halfway around the world?

""Jessie, did that bastard do something to hurt you?"" Dexter's voice turned deadly serious.

Jessica pressed her lips together, then decided to keep things vague for now: ""Dad, don't ask questions yet. I'll tell you everything once I'm in London.""

The Rolandos and Atlantes had been business partners for decades, and the marriage had tangled things up even more. She didn't want her family caught in the crossfire.

Her father finally gave in: ""Alright, but come by the office today. You'll need to get up to speed on the European operations.""

Jessica nodded and hung up. She dragged herself to the bathroom, wincing at her reflection—her eyes were swollen like she'd gone ten rounds with a boxer.

The divorce papers were already sitting on her nightstand, delivered by her lawyer that morning. But she still had no clue how to bring this up to Quentin. Seven years didn't just disappear overnight.

She caked on concealer to hide the evidence of her breakdown, threw on a sharp business suit and headed downstairs.

Betty was in the kitchen with Nosh, probably trying to act normal after yesterday's shitshow.

""Aunt Jess is awake!"" Nosh came running over on his little legs, grabbing her hand and blowing on it gently. ""Mommy said your heart was hurting yesterday. My magic breath will make it better!""

Six-year-olds were so damn innocent. Jessica ruffled his hair. ""You're such a sweet boy, Nosh. Aunt Jess feels much better now. Go finish your breakfast with Mommy.""

Nosh nodded seriously and scampered back to Betty.

Jessica's mind drifted to yesterday—Quentin laughing and playing with that little boy.

If their baby had survived, he'd probably be older than Carter by now.

Jessica took a shaky breath, shoving down the pain threatening to surface again. She grabbed her purse and headed out the door.

But the second she stepped out of Betty's townhouse, she spotted a figure leaning against a black Mercedes in the distance.

Quentin looked exhausted, a cigarette dangling from his lips, smoke curling around him like a shield.

Jessica froze. According to Betty's intel, both Carrie Versta and her son had July birthdays. Carrie's had already passed, but Carter's was still coming up—so why the hell was Quentin back early?

Her stare must've been intense because he suddenly looked up. And the moment their eyes met, his dull eyes completely lit up.

He strode over and pulled her into his arms.

His embrace was still warm, but now it felt like it was burning her alive.

""How's that cold? You sounded awful on the phone, so I caught a red-eye back.""

""Got to the house and you weren't there—figured you'd be at Betty's.""

Quentin's voice was thick with concern, and he looked genuinely worried.

Jessica still couldn't wrap her head around it—how could the man who claimed to love her more than life itself be playing house with another woman and their kid?

Her lips trembled as she swallowed the bile rising in her throat. She wanted to scream at him, demand answers, but instead she managed: ""I'm fine now. Was just heading home.""

Quentin's shoulders sagged with relief: ""Next time you're sick, call me immediately, okay? I was losing my mind worrying about you.""

His voice was so gentle, so caring—for a split second, she almost believed they were still that perfect couple.

But then she caught sight of a slim figure hovering near the street corner.

Carrie stood under a tree with phone pressed to her ear, saying something. A second later, Quentin's phone started buzzing.

He glanced at the screen and his face shifted: ""Shit, emergency at the office. I gotta handle this.""

Jessica's breath caught. She wasn't blind—she'd seen that name flash across his screen. Carrie Versta.

The bitterness was about to choke her, but she forced herself to say: ""Of course, go handle your business. Work comes first.""

Quentin looked genuinely guilty as he kissed her forehead before jumping in his car and speeding off.

The moment Quentin drove away, Carrie ended her call and sauntered over with a predatory smile: ""Hello there, you must be Jessica. I'm Carrie Versta, I'm...""

She trailed off meaningfully, taking in Jessica's tight expression and realizing something.

""Oh, looks like Miss. Rolando already know about me and Carter. Well then, just sit back and enjoy the show.""

Chapter 3

Jessica hailed a cab and tailed Carrie to the hospital.

Standing outside the room, she watched everything unfold, feeling like a knife was twisting in her chest.

She bit down hard on her lip to keep from making a sound.

Quentin's son was hooked up to an IV, his little face pale and exhausted—he looked so fragile.

Quentin was completely freaking out, pacing the room and absolutely losing his shit:

""Are you kidding me right now? Can't even treat a kid's fever properly!""

The attending physician was Wayne Cortes—Jessica recognized him as one of Quentin's best buddies from college.

""Your kid's running a fever because he caught a cold. Maybe focus on being a better parent instead of screaming at my residents!""

""Jesus, Quentin, I don't know what's gotten into you. Didn't you say you'd pay that woman off after she had the baby? Now you're calling me over every damn cold. What happens if Jessica finds out?""

After a long pause, Quentin's voice came out tired and defeated: ""What am I supposed to do, Wayne? The kid loses his mind every time I try to send Carrie away. He won't stop crying. I can't just let him suffer like that.""

""Oh please, we both know this isn't about the kid,"" Wayne snorted. ""You're getting attached to playing house.""

That set Quentin off even more. He rubbed his temples hard: ""That's bullshit and you know it. Jessica's the only woman I've ever loved—that hasn't changed. But the Atlante family needs an heir, and you need to help me keep this from her. I can't stand the thought of hurting her.""

""As for Carrie, she gave me a son. I owe her that much.""

Right on cue, Carrie pushed through the door, tears streaming down her face: ""Oh God, Quentin, this is all my fault. I should've taken better care of Carter. He spiked a fever right after you left last night, crying for his daddy, but I didn't want to interrupt your time with your wife...""

Quentin touched the kid's burning forehead and sighed, his heart finally softened.

He pulled Carrie into his arms: ""Shh, don't cry. I'm not blaming you. Carter's our son—I'm the one who's been a shitty father.""

Carrie clutched at his shirt, her fingers trailing across his chest: ""Quentin, I know I'll never measure up to Jessica, but I just can't stand watching our boy suffer...""

Quentin's expression hardened with determination: ""Nobody's gonna dare to make my son suffer. But you need to take care of yourself too. Look at you, you're a mess.""

He reached up and gently wiped away a tear from her cheek, the intimate gesture slicing through Jessica's chest like a blade.

Jessica clenched her fists so hard her nails drew blood, leaving crescent-shaped marks on her palms. She couldn't even feel the physical pain anymore.

Nothing could compete with the agony tearing through her heart.

Rain started pouring down again as Jessica left the hospital.

She walked through the downpour, completely numb. Rain mixed with tears on her face, blurring her vision, but it couldn't wash away the devastation inside her.

By the time she reached the Rolando Group headquarters, her heels had rubbed her ankles raw and bloody.

The receptionist nearly jumped out of her skin when she saw Jessica's condition: ""Ms. Rolando! Oh my God, what happened? Should I call Mr. Atlante? He's going to be so worried when he sees you like this!""

Jessica's heart had gone completely numb. Yeah, everyone just assumed Quentin loved her—no exceptions.

But they never knew how much lies and betrayal were mixed into that so-called love.

She gently pushed away the receptionist's helping hands, her voice hoarse: ""I'm fine. Just got caught in the rain. Can you grab me some clean clothes?""

She handed over her card and locked herself in the nearest conference room.

The moment the door closed, Jessica completely fell apart. She'd thought seeing those photos had prepared her for reality.

But watching that perfect little family unit up close had ripped open her deepest wounds all over again, leaving her raw and bleeding.

Her heartbroken sobs echoed through the empty conference room.

She wanted to scream at Quentin—why was he the one making all those promises back then, and now he was the one playing happy family with someone else?

A knock at the door finally pulled her back to reality.

By the time she pulled herself together and opened the door, whoever it was had already left. Just a fresh outfit and her credit card sitting there, plus a steaming cup of coffee.

A handwritten note was tucked under the mug: ""Don't worry, Ms. Rolando. I didn't call Mr. Atlante. Figured you wouldn't want him to worry.""

A storm of emotions churned in Jessica's heart. But in the end she tore up the note and tossed it in the trash.

She grabbed the clothes and hit the bathroom to change. Within minutes, she was back to being the untouchable Rolando heiress—nothing could touch her now.

She spent the rest of the day buried in work, her heels clicking authoritatively across the executive floor.

Quentin had been texting her nonstop. She didn't even glance at her phone.

That evening, she dragged herself exhausted ass home, planning to pack and catch the first flight out of JFK in the morning.

But the moment she opened the front door, she heard a child's giggles echoing through the living room.

The sex was good—it always was.

But as Nathan Harrison rolled off her and reached for his cigarettes, Amelia knew something was coming.

She could feel it in the way he wouldn't look at her, in the tension radiating from his shoulders.

""We need to get divorced.""

Just like that. No buildup, no explanation. Like he was asking her to pass the salt.

Amelia was still trying to catch her breath, her skin flushed and damp. She turned toward him, confused. ""What?""

Nathan lit his cigarette, the flame briefly illuminating his sharp features before darkness settled between them again. ""She's got stomach cancer. Six months, maybe less.""

She. Always she. Never a name, like saying it out loud would make it too real.

""Dying as my wife—that's all she wants."" He took a long drag, exhaling slowly. ""It would mean everything to her.""

The bedroom went quiet except for the distant hum of traffic from the city below. Their shadows stretched across the wall from the bedside lamp, and Amelia stared at them—two people who should be close but felt like strangers.

""It's not permanent,"" Nathan continued when she didn't respond. ""Just until... you know. Then we'll get back together.""

""Amelia, she's dying.""

His voice was so calm, so reasonable. Like he was discussing weekend plans instead of asking her to give up her marriage.

Amelia studied his profile—the same face she'd been in love with since she was seventeen. God, had it really been seven years? Seven years of following him around like a lost puppy, taking whatever scraps of attention he threw her way.

She remembered the night that started it all. Rain pouring down, her stepfather's fist connecting with her ribs for the third time that week. Then Nathan appeared out of nowhere, soaking wet, gripping a broken piece of fence like a weapon.

""Back off!"" he'd shouted, stepping between them. ""You touch her again, I swear to God—""

He'd saved her that night. Seventeen-year-old Amelia had fallen so hard she never got back up.

For seven years, she'd done everything he asked. Followed him to college, changed her major to match his interests, even turned down job offers in other cities just to stay close. And every time she succeeded, every time she made him proud, he'd ruffle her hair and say, ""Good job, Mia.""

It was never enough, but she'd convinced herself it was just how he showed love. Quiet. Reserved. Even when people called her pathetic for chasing him, she didn't care. He was Nathan Harrison, and somehow, impossibly, he'd chosen her.

When his grandfather got sick last year and the family decided a wedding might bring good luck, Nathan had asked her almost casually: ""Want to make it official?"" She'd thought all those years of waiting had finally paid off.

But marriage hadn't changed anything. If anything, he seemed more distant than ever.

""Are you even listening to me?"" Nathan's voice cut through her thoughts, sharp with irritation.

""Yeah, I'm listening."" Amelia sat up, pulling the sheet around herself. ""You want to divorce me so you can marry your dying girlfriend.""

""She's not my girlfriend."" The words came out too quick, too defensive. ""Look, she's going through hell, okay? And she's never tried to break us up or anything. She could've easily made a move, but she didn't because she respects our marriage.""

Amelia almost laughed. Respects our marriage. Right.

""Every time I try to help her, she says no because she doesn't want to hurt you."" Nathan's voice took on that self-righteous tone she'd grown to hate. ""She's a good person, Mia. She doesn't deserve to die alone.""

""And what about me?"" The question slipped out before she could stop it.

Nathan's jaw tightened. For a moment, he looked almost annoyed that she'd asked. ""She's dying, Amelia.""

""I get that, but—""

""She loves me, okay?"" The admission hung in the air between them. ""And yeah, maybe I have feelings for her too. But we've never done anything about it because of you. We've never even kissed.""

Because of me. Like she was some obstacle they'd heroically overcome.

""She's kind and selfless, and she's running out of time."" Nathan's voice went cold. ""Don't make me think you're the kind of person who'd deny a dying woman her last wish.""

There it was. The trap, perfectly set. Be the good wife and step aside, or be the heartless bitch who wouldn't let a cancer patient die happy.

Amelia looked at him—really looked at him. When had he become this stranger? When had the boy who'd saved her turned into someone who could ask her to break her own heart and call it kindness?

She knew exactly when. The day Vivian Hope walked into their lives.

""You're sure about this?"" she asked quietly. ""The divorce?""

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line. He stared at the wall, not meeting her eyes. ""Yeah. Look, you—""

""Okay.""

The word stopped him mid-sentence. His head snapped toward her, eyes narrowing like he was trying to figure out her angle.

""Just like that?""

""Just like that.""

Something flickered across his face—surprise, maybe suspicion. ""You're up to something.""

""I'm not up to anything, Nathan.""

""Bullshit. You're playing some game, trying to guilt me or—""

""I said okay."" Amelia's voice was steady, almost eerily calm. ""What else do you want?""

Nathan studied her for a long moment, then stubbed out his cigarette harder than necessary. ""Fine. Whatever."" He grabbed his clothes from the floor, pulling them on with sharp, angry movements. ""I'll have my lawyer draw up the papers.""

He headed for the door without another word, like her feelings didn't matter at all. Like asking your wife to divorce you so you could marry someone else was just another Tuesday night conversation.

The door slammed behind him, leaving Amelia alone in the sudden quiet.

Her phone buzzed against the nightstand. A text from a contact she'd labeled ""Vivian's Fake Account.""

He stopped by again tonight. ?

Attached was a photo taken through a glass door—Nathan's reflection, smiling in a way Amelia had never seen. Soft. Tender. Like he was looking at something precious.

She scrolled up through months of messages:

He told me he's falling for me.

Rainy night but I'm not cold. He's keeping me warm. ☔❤️

The real mistress is the one who isn't loved, Amelia. You're just his convenient wife for the family. I'm the one in his heart.

Message after message, each one a small knife twisting deeper. Proof of every suspicion she'd tried to ignore.

She'd never seen Nathan look the way he did in these photos. Never heard his voice go soft like it apparently did when he talked to Vivian. With Amelia, he was always controlled, distant. With Vivian, he was alive.

The first message was from eight months ago: You know who this is. Did you like the flowers I sent for your living room? Nathan said they were perfect.

Vivian Hope. Instagram darling, Manhattan's go-to floral designer for the wealthy elite. Amelia had shown Nathan these messages before, but he'd dismissed them.

""Could be anyone,"" he'd said. ""Where's your proof it's actually her? You probably sent these to yourself.""

Most of the photos were generic—shots anyone could take from outside a building or across a restaurant. But tonight's was different. Clear. Undeniable.

Would it matter? Would showing him change anything?

Amelia set the phone aside and opened the bottom drawer of her nightstand. Hidden under old magazines was a manila folder containing the pregnancy test she'd taken that morning.

Positive.

She was carrying Nathan's baby, and he wanted to divorce her to marry another woman.

Her tears hit the paper, smearing the medical print. She picked up Nathan's lighter from the ashtray and held the flame to the corner of the document, watching it curl and burn.

He'd never know. This divorce would be the last favor she'd ever do for him.

Seven years. Seven years of her life spent loving someone who'd never really loved her back.

But she was done now. Done chasing, done hoping, done being grateful for scraps.

Nathan Harrison had saved her once when she was seventeen and broken. Now, at twenty-four, she was going to save herself.

Chapter 2

Nathan drummed his fingers against the steering wheel of his Maybach, parked outside the Manhattan Family Court. His phone lit up with an incoming call.

""Nathan, sweetheart!"" His grandmother's voice was bright but pointed. ""You and Amelia have been married a whole year. When am I getting some great-grandbabies?""

Nathan's face softened despite himself. ""Grandma, we're still figuring things out. No need to rush."" He shifted in his seat. ""How's Grandpa doing? Is he—""

""Oh, don't you try to change the subject on me,"" she interrupted with a laugh. ""Your grandfather's doing much better, thank the Lord, but honey, we're not spring chickens anymore. We want to see those babies before we're too old to spoil them rotten.""

""Grandma...""

Her tone turned serious. ""And Nathan? I've been hearing things around town. Gossip. You better be treating that sweet girl right, you hear me?""

Nathan went silent for a beat too long.

""Nathan James Harrison, are you listening to me?""

He rubbed his temples. ""Yeah, Grandma. I hear you loud and clear.""

After another few minutes of her gentle but persistent questioning, Nathan finally managed to end the call. He stared at the courthouse entrance, his jaw working.

He pulled up his messages, thumb hovering over Vivian's contact—the heart emoji next to her name, the photo of her laughing in golden sunlight. He scrolled past it and tapped Amelia's name instead. Their last exchange was just logistics: time, place, what to bring.

She was ten minutes late. Not like her at all.

Where are you?

A tap on his window made him look up. Amelia stood there looking washed out, dark circles under her eyes. She slid into the passenger seat without a word.

She was wearing the same clothes from yesterday—a cream blazer and black pants she'd bought for him last month. ""You look good in earth tones,"" she'd said, holding the jacket up to his chest.

For seven years, she'd dressed him, fed him, organized his entire life down to his dentist appointments.

""You're late,"" he said.

""By ten minutes."" Her voice was flat. No apology, no excuse. The old Amelia would've shown up an hour early with coffee and an explanation for every minute of delay.

Nathan's drumming stopped. He studied her profile—pale, distant, like she wasn't really there.

""My grandmother just called."" He looked straight ahead. ""We can't tell them about any of this. The divorce, I mean. It would kill them.""

Amelia didn't nod or agree like she usually did. Instead: ""What did she say?""

""Wants grandkids. The usual."" Nathan's voice tightened with irritation. ""She's been hearing rumors about us.""

The silence stretched between them. After what felt like forever, Amelia let out a short, bitter laugh.

Nathan's hands clenched. He kept his eyes on the courthouse steps, watching couples come and go.

He'd thought about kids before. Late at night, after sex, he'd sometimes trace circles on Amelia's stomach and murmur, ""Maybe we should start trying soon."" It was always someday, eventually, when things settled down.

But Vivian only had six months. After that, everything would go back to normal. There'd be plenty of time for babies then.

""Last chance to back out,"" Amelia said quietly. ""Do you really want to do this?""

""Are you kidding me right now?"" The anger in his voice was sharp, real. ""Vivian's at home waiting for an answer. Don't start playing games.""

Instead of responding, Amelia pulled out a thick manila envelope and handed it to him.

Nathan frowned as he opened it. Property division agreement. Legal letterhead, official seals, the works.

""Since we're doing this, we might as well do it right,"" she said, her tone businesslike. ""I'm only taking what's legally mine. Everything else stays with your family.""

She placed a pen on the center console. ""The cooling-off period starts once we sign. Whatever money we make during the separation belongs to each of us individually.""

Nathan scanned the document. It was thorough, professional, and surprisingly generous to him. Her signature was already there in careful script.

""What's this about?"" He looked up at her. ""It's just temporary. Six months, then we're back to normal.""

""Maybe. Maybe not.""

Something cold settled in his stomach. ""What's that supposed to mean?""

""Just sign it, Nathan.""

He studied her face, looking for the crack, the tell that would reveal her angle. Amelia always had an angle—some way to make him feel guilty or sorry for her. She'd tried it before with those fake messages she claimed were from Vivian.

But her expression was unreadable.

Fine. Let her play whatever game this is.

Nathan grabbed the pen and signed with sharp, aggressive strokes. No one manipulated him. Not anymore.

Two copies. Amelia folded hers neatly and slipped it into her purse.

The actual filing was bureaucratic and cold. Take a number, submit paperwork, fill out forms. The clerk explained the thirty-day waiting period with the enthusiasm of someone reading a grocery list. They each got a receipt with a return date circled in red ink.

Outside, the September sun was surprisingly warm. Nathan watched a young couple emerge from the building, both grinning, the woman showing off her ring to anyone who'd look.

He remembered Amelia doing the same thing a year ago. Practically glowing as she called her friends to share the news.

Now she stood beside him like she was waiting for a bus.

""I'll keep your account funded during the separation,"" he said, not looking at her. ""And remember what I said about my grandparents.""

He started walking toward his car, then stopped. ""Amelia.""

She looked at him, eyebrows raised.

""This is temporary. You get that, right?""

""Sure, Nathan.""

Something about the way she said it bothered him, but Vivian was waiting. He got in his car and drove away without looking back.

Amelia watched his Maybach disappear into traffic. When her Uber arrived, she climbed in and gave the driver an address on the Upper East Side.

Two cars. Two different destinations.

Nathan pulled up outside Vivian's design studio, a trendy space in SoHo with floor-to-ceiling windows and Instagram-worthy displays. She was waiting by the door, wearing a soft yellow dress that made her look fragile and beautiful.

""How did it go?"" she asked, searching his face.

Nathan pulled out his receipt and showed her. ""All taken care of. She signed everything without a fight.""

Forty blocks away, Amelia sat in an exam room at Mount Sinai, staring at the motivational posters on the walls. The paper crinkled under her as she shifted on the table.

""Mia, honey, are you absolutely sure about this?"" Dr. Harper Lopez pulled up a stool, her face creased with concern. ""You've been trying to get pregnant for months. Just last year you were asking me about fertility supplements.""

Amelia placed the courthouse receipt on the small table beside her, right next to the positive pregnancy test she'd taken yesterday morning.

""I'm sure,"" she said, her voice steady as stone.

""I want it gone.""

Chapter 3

Harper stared at the divorce paperwork like it might bite her.

She'd known Amelia for fifteen years, watched her completely lose herself over Nathan Harrison. The girl had literally restructured her entire life around that man—changed colleges, switched majors, turned down jobs in other cities. Harper had watched her best friend shrink into someone she barely recognized.

When they got married last year, Harper thought maybe it would finally be enough. Maybe Nathan would actually see what he had.

Apparently not.

""I'm done with him."" Amelia's voice was steady, matter-of-fact.

She smiled then—not the sad, hopeful smile Harper had gotten used to, but something real. For just a second, Harper saw a flash of the old Amelia. The girl who used to own every room she walked into, back when her dad was alive and the Visconti name still meant something in this city.

""Good,"" Harper said simply. ""About damn time.""

""Nathan doesn't know about the baby."" Amelia's fingers traced the edge of the exam table. ""There's a thirty-day waiting period for the divorce. I can't risk him finding out and trying to use it against me.""

Harper nodded. Made perfect sense. During the cooling-off period, either spouse could withdraw the petition. If Nathan knew about the pregnancy, he'd probably try to guilt her into staying.

""Okay, so here's the thing,"" Harper said, pulling up Amelia's file. ""We can't do the procedure right away. You're type AB-negative, which means we need to special-order blood just in case. It'll take about a week.""

Amelia's face went tight. AB-negative—her father's blood type. One more reminder of everything she'd lost.

""And Mia?"" Harper's voice went gentle. ""You're showing signs of threatened miscarriage. You need to be really careful the next few days. No stress, lots of rest.""

""What does that mean exactly?""

""Cramping, some spotting. Your body's... well, it's under a lot of stress right now. Just take it easy, okay?""

Harper squeezed her friend's shoulder. ""I'm off in like an hour. Want me to drive you home?""

""Yeah, that'd be great.""

Amelia headed to the waiting room, one hand instinctively pressed to her stomach. Was her body already making the decision for her?

Her phone buzzed. Bank alert—deposit from the new account she'd opened that morning. A text followed immediately.

Hey! Royalty check just went through. You should see it in your account now.

Before Nathan, Amelia had been a songwriter. Not the kind who performed—the kind who stayed in the background and crafted hits for other people. Her father had encouraged her music when she was young, back when money wasn't an issue. After he died and everything went to hell, those piano lessons became her survival.

Got it, thanks.

You know, you've written some of our biggest songs. Ever think about stepping into the spotlight? There's this new singing competition—all original material. I could get you an audition.

Amelia scrolled through the email her manager had sent. A reality show, basically, but focused on songwriting and original music instead of covers.

Maybe. Let me think about it.

She set her phone down as a sharp cramp hit her lower abdomen.

God, she missed her dad. If he could see her now...

Meanwhile, social media was having a field day:

\#VivianHopeCancer trending #1

\#FloralDesignerDying trending #3

\#TerminalDiagnosis trending #8

The top video had already hit two million views:

Celebrity floral designer Vivian Hope, known for her work with Manhattan's elite, revealed today that she has terminal stomach cancer and only six months to live. Instead of stepping away from public life, Hope plans to document her final months online.

In the video, Vivian looked ethereal—pale but beautiful, like some tragic heroine. ""I want to share this journey with everyone who might be going through something similar. To show that even when you're dying, you can still choose hope.""

The reporter's voice continued over B-roll footage: ""Hope has been romantically linked to Harrison Industries CEO Nathan Harrison, though Harrison recently married. Sources close to the situation say this could be a real-life tragedy worthy of Hollywood.""

Vivian stepped back into frame, interrupting with practiced grace. ""I'm not going to lie about my feelings. Nathan is... he's an incredible man. But he's married, and I respect that completely. I would never try to come between them.""

She walked away from the cameras, leaving the reporter to wrap up the segment.

The moment she was out of sight, Vivian slipped into a waiting Town Car. A woman in scrubs handed her a water bottle, looking nervous as hell.

""Spit it out,"" Vivian said without looking up from her phone.

The woman glanced at the driver, then leaned closer. ""Miss Hope, your actual diagnosis is just gastritis. Having us falsify medical records is already illegal, but now you're going public with it? What happens when people start digging?""

Vivian's smile was ice-cold. ""Is your clinic a licensed medical facility?""

""Yes, but—""

""Are my records stored independently?""

""Yes.""

""And what do those records say?""

The woman swallowed hard. ""Terminal stomach cancer. Six-month prognosis.""

""Exactly. So if anyone investigates, that's what they'll find."" Vivian's voice turned dangerous. ""And if complications arise later, we have options. Either I make a miraculous recovery thanks to some experimental treatment, or your clinic made a massive diagnostic error that put me through months of unnecessary trauma. Which scenario sounds better for your malpractice insurance?""

The fake nurse went white. ""I understand, Miss Hope. I'm sorry for questioning you.""

""Good. Now, we're going to New York Presbyterian.""

""Is that... safe?""

""I need to pick up some legitimate pain medication. Doctor's orders."" Vivian fired off a quick text to Nathan: At the hospital picking up meds. Can you meet me?

His response was instant: Already on my way.

Two floors up, Amelia sat in a bathroom stall, staring at the bright red blood on the tissue paper. Her hand pressed against her cramping stomach.
