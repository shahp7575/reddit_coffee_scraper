I know being pregnant can cause some intense dreams, but still! 

In this dream, I had a cute little pet rat. This pet rat was a boy, white and grey. He was a particularly beautiful rat because of the way the grey splotches were placed on his little body. We had a bond so close that I could take him to the park without worry he would run away, because he always came back to me when I called. 

So we were at the park playing around on the playground. My little boy cousin was about 3 in my dream and also playing around, but not with us. Once we were all done, we went inside. Inside, my mother and aunt (grandmother of little cousin) were sitting on the couch. I didn‚Äôt know my aunt brought her big black dog, which scared my rat under the coffee table. I tried to get my rat to come to me but he instead scurried up my pant leg and ran INTO MY VAGINA. I nonchalantly pulled my pants down, grabbed the rat tail and pulled him safely out of my vagina. My mom and aunt started laughing and clapping, I felt proud? 

I then got all my things together to go home. My husband and I were sitting in the car before leaving, watching a whole flock of black birds fly away from the top of a building. When all of a sudden one of the birds got into our car and we panicked. The bird, wings fully spread, thumped into my chest so hard it knocked me awake.

1i1quq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmployeeExperience/comments/1i1quq1/is_priya_alone_stressed_being_in_corporate/,Is Priya alone stressed being in corporate?,"My friend Priya (28F) was what you‚Äôd call a go-getter. She thrived on challenges, always taking on more than she could handle, because, well, she could handle it. At least, that‚Äôs what she believed.
But earlier this year, something changed. Priya started feeling‚Ä¶ off. The once-enthusiastic professional who loved her work began waking up with a pit in her stomach. She described it to me one day over coffee:
‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm just existing, not living. I wake up, work, sleep‚Äîrepeat. I don‚Äôt even know who I am anymore.‚Äù
It wasn‚Äôt just work stress. She started losing weight, stopped sleeping well, and the smallest tasks‚Äîlike replying to an email‚Äîfelt insurmountable. The worst part? She thought she had to power through it because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what everyone does in corporate life,‚Äù right?
On 12th December, she broke down completely. Tears, frustration, hopelessness. I didn‚Äôt know what to say, but I listened. Then, in the middle of her venting, she said something that stuck with me:
‚ÄúI just want to feel okay again. Is that too much to ask?‚Äù
That‚Äôs when I encouraged her to talk to her HR team.
Now, Priya is not the kind of person to admit she needs help. She‚Äôs the type to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this,‚Äù even when she doesn‚Äôt. But she did it. She told her HR about what she and others in her team were feeling and suggested they consider bringing in some support for employees. To her surprise, they actually took her seriously.
A month later, the company introduced counselling services. Priya hesitated at first‚Äîtherapy felt like uncharted territory‚Äîbut she booked a session.
And let me tell you, it changed her life.
She started unpacking the layers of stress she‚Äôd been carrying for years. Her counsellor helped her understand why she felt so stuck and taught her how to set boundaries. For the first time, Priya began saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to unreasonable demands and taking time for herself without guilt.
Slowly, things started to shift.
But the best part? It wasn‚Äôt just her. The entire company felt the ripple effects. Teams began communicating better. Managers started being more empathetic. The workplace didn‚Äôt magically turn into a utopia, but it became a space where people could breathe, speak up, and feel supported.
Today, Priya is thriving. She‚Äôs not ‚Äújust existing‚Äù anymore‚Äîshe‚Äôs living. She‚Äôs rediscovered hobbies, reconnected with friends, and, most importantly, found herself again.
Her story taught me something I‚Äôll never forget: It‚Äôs okay to admit you‚Äôre not okay. It‚Äôs okay to ask for help. And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is speak up‚Äînot just for yourself, but for others who might be struggling silently.
If you‚Äôre feeling like Priya did, please know this: You‚Äôre not alone. And it‚Äôs never too late to take that first step toward feeling okay again. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Have you ever experienced burnout like this? How did you get through it? Or are you still figuring it out? Let‚Äôs talk‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear your story.

","A few years ago, I felt stuck in a dark place. I was battling loneliness, and it felt like no one really understood what I was going through. My days were spent going through the motions‚Äîwork, home, sleep‚Äîwithout any real connection or joy. I‚Äôd watch others laugh with friends, share their lives, and enjoy themselves, while I felt like I was invisible.

One day, I realized something: loneliness is not a permanent condition. It‚Äôs a feeling, and feelings can change with action. I didn‚Äôt know where to start, but I promised myself I‚Äôd try.

I began with **small steps**:

* I joined a local class to learn something new (photography, in my case). It was terrifying at first, but being around people who shared my interest gave me something to look forward to.
* I started **volunteering** at a local shelter. The act of helping others‚Äîwhether it was walking dogs or packing meals‚Äîmade me feel purposeful and connected.
* I made an effort to be kinder to myself. I journaled about the little things I appreciated each day, even if it was just a good cup of coffee or a sunset.

At first, the changes felt insignificant. But over time, they added up. I started forming friendships, learning to enjoy my own company, and feeling more grounded. I realized that while the world won‚Äôt always come to you, you can take small steps to reach out to it.

Today, I‚Äôm in a much better place. Loneliness still visits me sometimes, but I‚Äôve learned how to manage it, how to seek connection, and how to cherish my own company.

To anyone who feels like I did, I want to say this: **It‚Äôs okay to feel lonely, but don‚Äôt let it define you. Take one small step today, no matter how tiny it feels. Over time, those steps will lead you to a brighter place.**

I‚Äôm sharing this because if I could change my life, I believe anyone can. You‚Äôve got this. üåü",1,1736919498.0,GetMotivatedBuddies,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm high functioning and I was dependent on caffeine. I always had afternoon slump 3pm.

I don‚Äôt get energy from food, is this normal?

I noticed I had sharp pain in my body and spine from eating larger amounts of cabbage - like a cabbage-based salad. I notice sensitivities to gluten - bread.¬†

In general I‚Äôve felt best when I withhold from food as along as possible. I generally wake at 6am, one coffee at 7.30am and then I eat at 12.30pm. I try to make my first meal lighter and then have my second and final meal at 6.30pm and sleep at 9.30pm.

I eat mostly beef, and some eggs. I sometimes use butter, and sometimes if I get a craving for raw honey I‚Äôll have a scoop.

Some days it‚Äôs harder to do. Particularly if I work from the computer, writing, I can easily think about food. Some tasks just make me hungrier and get me thinking about food more. The easiest days are when I‚Äôm out and about, on my feet, and running errands.¬†

They have their own A√ßai blend, their own blueberry granola. everything is chopped fresh and simply amazing 9.4/10

my exact order is the moonlight bowl, no banana, add coconut, add cocoa nibs -> $12 out the door

image 2 is favorite pizza in Orange County from Folks's Pizzeria in The Camp. I order the Margherita, no cheese. Very respectful staff, this john is enough for 2. i am sure they can add more sauce for a charge, i always get it as is, just my preference. 9.1/10 about $30ish out the door

if i had to be biased, i'd say that the crust/dough is worth every penny. alternative here is getting dough @ rye goods (go on friday, saturday, sunday -> check the fridge or ask). all organic ingredients and makes 2 individual 12 inch pies + ingredients + bake time + clean up. again idk the price but probably ~$30 OTD. 

image 3 is from Boil & Bake in Costa Mesa. for $20 OTD you have to sub in the Ardent Vegan Almond Spread, its garlic flavored. Leavened dough with farm fresh ingredients. it's brother bagel, Bob & Larry, is the sandwich version. both equally as phenomenal. yes, i know, with this economy, but the spread is simply so out of this world, i went to meet the women who owns the company and she is a real life unicorn. truly a miracle bagel for OC.

my order pictured is Through The Garden, the vegan way on everything. Drizzle Zab's Original Hot Sauce and remember to grab maybe 7 napkins. I always get the OJ bc it's fresh pressed and also the sprinkler system for my mouth. yes, they offer complimentary water. 9.4/10

Will keep adding more paragraphs- It would just be nice if someone could listen to me vent and rant. But also take the time to respond and offer advice. I feel so lost and alone. It seems no one cares, they don‚Äôt listen or seem to hear me, they don‚Äôt seem to want to help me. I currently live with my father and stepmother. It‚Äôs not terrible but it also isn‚Äôt great either. I moved in over a year ago after I got kicked out of my last place. It‚Äôs a small town bed, one bath, one floor house. 

They gave up their room for me while they sleep out on the futon in the living room. My father is retired with some health problems and bad eye sight. He hardly ever drive anymore but he has two cars and a truck in his name. My stepmother drives the cars but she has to ask permission to drive places.

I don‚Äôt exactly have access to the kitchen. It‚Äôs a small and narrow kitchen with appliances on either side. My stepmother doesn‚Äôt like it when others are in the kitchen. Or when others come in while she‚Äôs in there. If I‚Äôm in the kitchen then she‚Äôll literally sit in silence and wait for me to come out. When she‚Äôs in the kitchen which she spends a lot of time in. She‚Äôs either redecorating, organizing, cleaning, cooking. There‚Äôs not a lot of space in the fridge for me to put my food if get some. 

The bathroom is the first room you see in the narrow hallway and it‚Äôs right in front of the kitchen table. It‚Äôs hard for me to use the bathroom because when I use the bathroom they don‚Äôt seem to like it. They have this thing about people going number 2, especially when they‚Äôre eating. They also have a 13 year old son who literally showers nearly every single day. Him and I both have to be someplace at 8 am. He use to take showers in the morning which conflicted with my own morning showers. Mostly showers at night but will sometimes shower in the morning when I need to.  

I have a day job that doesn‚Äôt pay much. I also have a leaners permit but no car. They give me rides to work in the morning. I don‚Äôt particularly like it. Then my father calls me back to back when it‚Äôs about time to get off work. I avoid going home right away, by going to other places. Like the coffee shop, book store, gym, etc.. they time how long I‚Äôve been gone. It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter how many times I reassure them. By telling them I‚Äôm fine, I‚Äôm okay, I‚Äôm not hungry, I‚Äôm full, I don‚Äôt need a ride, I‚Äôm not a child /baby etc.. but they don‚Äôt seem to listen or stop.

I had tried some locally roasted beans, and noticed that what they called ""dark"" roasts seemed to be significantly lighter, and I was having trouble pulling anything other than bitter shots despite having the correct ratio and timing. I also noticed that the washed beans had less oils and less of a body. I had decided it was a waste to even buy these specialty beans because I could never pull an enjoyable shot with them. After reading some on this subreddit, I messed around with pulling a 1:1 ""ristretto"" ratio and 1:3 ""lungo"" ratio, and found that for these ""lighter"" beans a shorter \~1:1.5 ratio comes out amazing and completely different than a 1:2 or 1:3 pull. I was shocked how much different the flavor and mouthfeel could be and was finally tasting the notes described on the bag. All that to echo what I've read in a few other places on here - if you're having trouble with flavor profile despite hitting the ""ideal"" ratio and timing with your shot, mess around with the dose and ratio and you might be surprised!

I have been unemployed for a few months, taking care of my grandparents for my mom because paying for caregivers has proven to be VERY expensive. I ride horses and have 11 years of experience with horses in general. I come from a low-middle class where I had to watch my mom go through bankruptcy and multiple vehicle repo's. My boyfriend works for his parents who own a jewelry store and are very well off. He loves video games and lives in the city. I don't. We live about an hour and 30 mins apart, I usually make the drive over since he hates the long drive, Which he made known the first time he drove down and was a sour asshole. It has been toxic since month one and we both agreed to work on it. My friends hated him from the start but didn't meet him until about 3 months in. We both have childhood trauma and I have triggers that i have been open with him about...he hardly respects them and i have a hard time bringing it up when i am triggered. I just deal with it, like the majority of this relationship. I have been wanting to plan for the future, because it is the new year and i need to set some goals, and I tried to include him but every time I do, it turns into a misunderstanding of some sort. Recently I have decided to give myself two goals to shoot for: (1) Sell my youngest horse (7yr Mare) who is able to ride, just needs some bulking up since i haven't ridden her in a while, use the money form the sale and open a small coffee shop/ Library. And (2) Don't sell my Mare and breed her and train her babies and sell them instead for an income. I told my boyfriend this and his response was ""Why are you telling me this?"" He has came over to my house and voiced his dislike for manure and Hair. I have 11 animals total....there's gonna be hair. Overall I am completely done with him emotionally and the only thing that is saving this relationship right now is the sex and how nice he acts in person. I have tried to break up with him multiple times and on one occasion he stated that he wanted to place a boundary around threatening the relationship when things get hard. And he is currently baiting me with moving out together. Which he decided to try to surprise me with it on our anniversary. I was pissed. not only had he excluded me from the process, he didn't tell me anything (bc its a surprise). The last time I tried to break up with him I was basically begging him to let me go, and to let me leave. I am done, and I have no interest in moving forward with someone so emotionally immature who is OLDER THAN ME.

No apology was ever show. No sense of guilt was shown from this man's side.

Chahats mom also ignored him when he was trying to apologize. 

She said she's she's cp mom. Who js he and she doesn't want anything from him.
So when did he apologize. Does anyone know or remember a live feed clip. 

Because he made fun of her mom as well and showed no remorse.

He also said a bunch of times chahat never we  out for coffee with him. They had no relationship. But she put her bf on the phone and he spoke to him????

How?????

Wouldn't u do that with ur friends only.

He said it's manas. I don't think so. Manas was pretty clear in his interview. And showed proof pics were morphed.

Said they know chahat for a lot longer how would avi know she has bf and they didn't know?

When I was 19 I got together with my then girlfriend who was 17 at the time. That feels weird to write down but whatever. When I was 20 I joined the military and we got married when I was 21 and she was 19 after 2 years. When I got stationed in Washington she told me a week before moving that she didn‚Äôt want to come but she still wanted to continue the relationship. After 7 months by myself and coming back from a deployment she surprised me by being there when I got back which was awesome and then a month later she said that she didn‚Äôt want to do this anymore. I was devastated and negotiated a 3 month break after which she said that she was still not interested. The weird thing is I wasn‚Äôt really happy in the relationship either and don‚Äôt really understand why it hurt so bad. I‚Äôve thought about this every day since then which was May of 2022. We never spoke of the process of getting divorced which I suppose I liked because I could continue to fantasize that we‚Äôd get back together. I‚Äôve had one serious relationship since then which ended a month ago and it was kind of the same phenomena. I had my reservations during the relationship but when she broke up with me I was devastated again even though it had only been 5 months. The day after I contacted my technically wife who I had not been in contact with since May of 2022 apologizing for all of the things I had felt guilty for the past year and a half and asking how we can wrap this up. When I met her the next day for coffee I was floored. She looked absolutely stunning and I was sucked right back in. She invited me over and I got to see my old dog. We started the paperwork to file on our own and I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm fucked up for wanting to ask if she wants to give it another shot. At the same time I have very similar feelings towards my ex girlfriend who I obviously didn‚Äôt tell I was married. I think this points to a personal flaw of extreme codependency and mental instability which has led me to not even be able to trust my own emotions. I have a crippling fear of being alone and I hate myself. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do. Do I just retire from being with people forever because I‚Äôm a psycho? I have no idea what to do.

But what if I told you that you don‚Äôt need a PhD in computer science or endless hours glued to your screen to harness the power of AI for your marketing efforts?

The truth is, the world of AI is evolving so rapidly that even the ""gurus"" are often scrambling to keep up. The good news is, you don‚Äôt need to become an AI coding wizard. You just need to know where to find the right tools and how to make them work for *you.* Think of it as getting a super-powered assistant who is always ready to help, and never complains about the work! üòâ



# From Overwhelmed to Empowered: Your First Step

Let's be honest, AI can feel like a massive, intimidating beast at first. It's like looking at a block of marble and thinking, ""How am I ever going to turn *that* into art?"" But here's the secret: you don't have to. You just need the right tools and a bit of guidance. You've been doing things a certain way for years, you‚Äôve built up your skills, but now everything seems to be shifting. That feeling of being out of place, like you‚Äôre trying to decipher an ancient language -I get it.

‚Ä¢

**Pro Tip:** Start small. Just like you wouldn‚Äôt dive into a massive project on day one, don't try to master all of AI at once. Begin with simple tasks like automating your email follow-ups, or generating social media posts. ***Little steps lead to big gains!*** You don't need to learn a bunch of new skills or be a prompt engineering expert, there are ways to leverage AI that are incredibly user-friendly.

There are even systems out there that are ""done for you"". Imagine having a system that does all the selling for you! What would that free up in your time?

‚ó¶

**Solution:** Look for AI tools that offer ready-made templates for various marketing tasks**. This way, you can see results without having to learn how to code or spend hours on the tech side of things**. There are even tools that can summarize blog posts and YouTube videos into lead magnets, making content creation a breeze\*\*.

There are people making a full time income and creating content using AI that they don't even have to show their face for! **It's like having a secret agent working for you behind the scenes**. The key is finding AI tools that understand *your* needs**.** You‚Äôre in good company if you feel like everyone is speaking a language that you just don't understand.



# The Time Crunch Solution: AI as Your Marketing Power Tool

Okay, so you‚Äôre busy, I get it. You‚Äôve got a lot on your plate and the last thing you need is another thing that takes up time. Let's say you've been trying to build your business. You've been grinding away every day to make it work. Now people are saying you have to learn about AI, too? That's like adding another item to the mile-long ""to-do"" list. The struggle is real!

‚Ä¢

**Pro Tip:** Time is money, and AI can save you a boatload of both! If you find yourself spending hours on content creation, setting up landing pages, or trying to make heads or tails of data, then you are going to love this, because there are AI tools designed to make these tasks a whole lot faster and easier. Don't get bogged down in the time-consuming stuff. ‚è≥

‚ó¶

**Solution:** Look for tools that offer automated lead capture pages **and can create content for you, like emails, blog posts, or social media content**. Forget spending hours or even days writing copy. There are tools that use AI to create content in a fraction of the time. You could produce emails, blog posts, reviews, and social media posts so quickly that it will be mind-boggling**. You could have content ready to use by filling in a few blanks!** Imagine what you can do with all that time, you could even go spend some time gardening or watching a movie. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

***It‚Äôs like having an intern that actually gets things done‚Ä¶ and without needing coffee breaks or a paycheck!*** Some may say that it's crazy if you‚Äôre not using AI to boost your marketing game**.** Well, I‚Äôm just going to say this: **It's like having a marketing guru in your pocket, 24/7, ready to work when you are.**



# The Art of AI-Assisted Creativity and Growth

So, you've taken the first step, you've saved some time, now it's time to actually grow with AI. One of the biggest misconceptions about AI is that it's going to replace human creativity. That's like saying a hammer will replace a carpenter. AI is a tool, and like any tool, it's how *you* use it that matters. The secret here is that AI can actually *enhance* your creativity\*\*.

‚Ä¢

**Pro Tip**: Think of AI as a brainstorming buddy, not a competitor. There are AI tools that can help you generate new ideas, draft outlines, and refine your written content. Don't be afraid to experiment. Try different prompts and see what happens! üß™ If you're feeling lost, remember that it's OK, just like when you were learning to ride a bike. It's all about the journey, not being perfect on the first try**. The world is now realizing that AI isn't just for tech wizards. It's for** ***everyone*** **who wants to do things better, smarter, and faster**.

‚ó¶

**Solution:** Explore tools that offer features like blog post summarizers, YouTube transcript converters, and ebook creators**. These tools can help you repurpose your existing content or get new content ideas quickly. Also, make sure you are using social media to boost your sign-ups**.

***This is your chance to get ahead. You can use AI to your advantage, and not the other way around.*** **And there are plenty of AI resources out there that can help you with content creation, lead generation, and follow-up systems**. One of the biggest breakthroughs in AI is that you don't need to know the technical side of things to benefit from it. It's about using your human intelligence with this artificial intelligence\*\*. There are tools out there to help you do everything from generating leads, to managing customer service. ü§Ø

It‚Äôs time to take the plunge! ü§ø Don't let the fear of the unknown hold you back. The future is here, and you have a unique opportunity to be a part of it. ü•≥ Just remember that you don't need to be a tech guru to make AI work for you.

Iced tea, Herr's sour cream & onion family size, hoagies‚Ä¶ but the one thing that was a staple of my childhood that I can‚Äôt seem to find anywhere online is a picture of what Wawa used to give away which was Courtesy Cups. 

These, from what I remember were light blue 16 oz cups with yellow and red accents. They actually said ‚Äúcourtesy cup‚Äù in a sort of cursive writing. They were of a similar size and shape to the Wawa coffee cups of today. We used to grab about 8 of them to pour half-gallon drinks into; probably part of the reason the company had to stop providing these free cups.

1i1pw18,https://www.reddit.com/r/DOG/comments/1i1pw18/do_dogs_feel_guilt/,Do dogs feel guilt?,"TL;DR: I'm trying to figure out when, how, and why a dog decides that calming signs and appeasement behaviors are needed.¬†

I read a few articles on dogs feeling guilt ([AKC](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/do-dogs-feel-guilt/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CA%20better%20description%20of%20the,Horowitz%20concludes) and [VCA](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/guilty-or-innocent-do-pets-know-they-have-done-something-wrong-when-they-act-guilty#:~:text=WRONG!,postures%20misinterpreted%20as%20'remorse') articles). The consensus seems to be that ""no, dogs are not feeling guilty‚Äîjust reacting to your behavior or past experiences.""

My personal experience is very different, and although I wish I could be 100% sure, I'm finding it hard to come to terms with that position. I got my Munk when she was 4 or 5 months old, and I believe that she had been sold and returned before me and that the former owners had attempted to train her with violence. I say that because the first time she had an accident in the living room, she cowered as soon as I walked in, even before I had seen it. And because she also went hiding the first time I walked in from the mailbox, carrying rolled-up magazines and newspaper. She is now 3.5 years old and has long lost those fears.

What led me to those articles and this post was something that happened a few days ago. I ate some BBQ ribs and used a paper towel to clean my face. I put the paper on the side table and washed my face and hands in the bathroom. I returned about 5 minutes later, and she had chewed up the paper towel but not touched the plate with the rib bones and sauce that were resting on the coffee table. As soon as I walked in and before I said anything, she was clearly avoiding eye contact, and when I called her to me (I wanted to check if she was about to swallow paper), she cowered down, avoided direct eye contact, wagged the tip of her tail, etc. - all the little ""I got caught"" signs. I have never yelled at her, and all the training, including ""leave plates and garbage alone"", was done through positive reinforcement.

So I'm sitting here wondering what is happening:

1. Is this still trauma leftovers from 3 years ago?
2. Is my behavior changing so subtly that I cannot notice it? I was not upset, but I got worried about her swallowing a paper towel.
3. I never trained with paper towels specifically, but has her mind rationalized from the training that:
   1. I do not want her to take food from plates, countertops, garbage, and the other usual suspects.
   2. The paper towel seemed like a safe bet to ""break the rules"".

Also, during crate training, I could swear that she often intentionally slept with half her body in the crate and half outside, as if ""trying to get away with it"". I had dismissed that as me anthropomorphizing her simply wanting to be next to me vs. the crate, and it just so happened that she would fall asleep in that position.

I recall that, for the longest time, the scientific consensus was that dogs and other animals do not have feelings. And it wasn't long ago that what people now call ""balanced training"" and ""alpha theory"" were considered facts. There is no need to argue those points here. I'm just referring to the changing positions. I'm more concerned about whether it is really that easy to anthropomorphize my dog's behavior. It actually makes me feel very gaslighted and makes me question my own perceptions and sanity, sometimes.",2,1736916513.0,DOG,2,1.0,False

1i1pu6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppBusiness/comments/1i1pu6e/how_you_can_get_more_in_app_purchases_in_2025/,How you can get more in app purchases in 2025 with the help of google ads and meta ads,"Hey app entrepreneurs, hope you‚Äôre doing great! This is going to be another long post (yes, grab a coffee) on how you can boost your in-app purchases (IAPs) effectively in 2025 using both Google Ads and Meta Ads. I want to share my personal experience after working with 300+ apps (including ad-supported and IAP-based ones) and highlight the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts that will help you supercharge your revenue.

# 1. First Things First: App Quality & User Flow

Before you even consider ads, make sure your app is at least decent. Shitty apps with messy UI or confusing user flows rarely see long-term success. People might buy something once, but they definitely won‚Äôt keep purchasing if your app experience is bad.

* **Ensure smooth navigation**: The path from app launch ‚Üí product page ‚Üí checkout (IAP) should be quick, intuitive, and free of bloat.
* **Build trust**: Display transparent pricing, highlight features, and ensure no weird popups or forced ads.
* **Track everything**: Integrate Firebase events, so you know exactly when users open your purchase screen and what triggers them to complete (or abandon) a purchase.

# 2. ASO & Targeted Keywords: Your Foundation

Yes, we‚Äôre focusing on Google Ads and Meta Ads for conversions (IAP sales), but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should ignore organic traffic. Good ASO helps reduce your paid user acquisition cost over time because you rank for relevant keywords.

* **Keyword research**: Use Google Keyword Planner, ChatGPT (long-tail KW ideas), or ASO tools like AppFollow.
* **Low-competition KWs**: Start targeting lower-competition, lower-traffic keywords until you get stable installs. Then gradually move toward high-competition, high-traffic KWs.
* **A/B Test Store Assets**: Change your icon, screenshots, and short descriptions to see which combination yields higher conversion rates (or boosts your IAP funnel).

# 3. Google Ads: Tactics for More IAPs

If you‚Äôre focusing on Android (and even if you‚Äôre on iOS), Google Ads can be a goldmine. Let‚Äôs break down the key considerations:

# 3.1 Start with Universal App Campaigns (UAC)

* **Set a target cost-per-action (CPA)** if you already have some data. If you don‚Äôt have data, start with install campaigns, gather data for a month, and then switch to a target ROAS or CPA campaign.
* **tROAS**: Once you have 50+ or 100+ purchase events, you can launch a tROAS campaign.
   * Start with 100‚Äì120% target ROAS. If you‚Äôre not getting enough revenue or purchases, gradually lower the target by 10% every week until you see conversions.
   * As soon as you start seeing consistent IAP revenue, begin increasing your target ROAS again.

# 3.2 Add High-Quality Creatives

* Google Ads allows up to 20 videos and 20 images in each ad group‚Äîuse them!
* Use **various aspect ratios**: 1:1, 16:9, 4:5, etc. The more variety, the better machine learning can figure out which creative resonates with different user segments.

# 3.3 Audience Targeting

* **Custom Audiences**: Create them based on relevant keywords, competitor app names, or user interests.
* **Retargeting**: If you already have an install base, set up remarketing campaigns for existing users to push them toward IAPs. Make sure your app is sending the right purchase event data to Firebase (and thus to Google Ads).

# 3.4 Location Targeting

* Remember to select ‚Äú**People in or regularly in your target location**‚Äù (not the default ‚Äòinterest in target location‚Äô) to avoid wasted ad spend from irrelevant regions.
* If your budget is global, segment your campaigns by region to analyze which countries yield higher IAPs and cut down on unprofitable ones.

# 3.5 Ad Revenue + IAP Tracking (If You Also Have Ads in Your App)

* Even if you‚Äôre focusing mainly on in-app purchases, some apps also generate revenue from ads.
* Link AdMob or other ad platforms with Firebase so you can see which campaigns yield better combined ROI (in-app purchases + ad revenue).

# 4. Meta Ads: Powerhouse for Specific Audiences

Meta Ads (Facebook + Instagram) can also yield a ton of IAP revenue if you know how to handle them. However, they can be trickier due to frequent policy changes and potential account suspensions. Here‚Äôs what you need to do:

# 4.1 Account Security

* **Enable two-factor authentication** and never share your admin login.
* Avoid suspicious plugins or extensions.
* Always verify your business so you have fewer chances of sudden bans.

# 4.2 Proper Campaign Setup

* **Objective**: Choose ‚ÄúConversions‚Äù and select your in-app purchase event (tracked via Facebook SDK or events).
* **CBO vs ABO**: If your daily budget is on the lower side (say under $50), try CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization). If you have a decent budget ($100+ daily), ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization) is better for testing multiple audiences separately.

# 4.3 Creative Testing

* **Don‚Äôt edit ads frequently**: Let them learn for at least a week before making changes. Frequent changes reset the learning phase.
* **Use Lookalike Audiences**: Once you have about 100‚Äì500 purchase events, create a 1‚Äì3% lookalike for best results. This can be a game-changer.
* **Remarketing**: Show dynamic or specialized ads to users who have installed but haven‚Äôt purchased in a while. Offer them a discount or show them new features/levels.

# 4.4 Budget Scaling

* Increase budgets gradually (20‚Äì25% increments) once you find a winning ad set.
* Keep a close eye on your cost per purchase metric‚Äîif it starts rising, revert changes or try a new creative approach.

# 5. UI/UX Matters: The Purchase Page

You can run the best ads in the world, but if your purchase flow is cumbersome or not enticing, you‚Äôll still see a huge drop-off. Some tips:

* **Highlight offers**: Show limited-time discounts, seasonal bundles, or exclusive content behind a paywall.
* **CTA Animations**: Use subtle animations that direct users‚Äô attention to the ‚ÄòBuy Now‚Äô or ‚ÄòUpgrade‚Äô button.
* **Simplified Payment Flow**: Fewer clicks, better clarity. Consider supporting multiple payment methods.

# 6. Leverage AI for Copy & Creative Ideas

You can always tap into ChatGPT or other AI tools to generate headlines, ad text, or even visual ideas. For example:

For my app ‚Äúapp name‚Äù about app ‚Äúapp description‚Äù and keywords (keywords list) create 10 ad headlines and 10 ad descriptions where headlines should be less than 30 chars and descriptions less than 90 chars. Do not use special characters in headlines and descriptions. Make every headlines unique and interesting and add cta in each description end. You can mention features in some ads

Use these AI-generated assets in both Google and Meta Ads to keep your creatives fresh and relevant.

# 7. Don‚Äôt Give Up Too Soon

This is a big one. Many indie devs stop promotions after 1 or 2 months because they don‚Äôt see immediate ROI. You need data, and data needs time. Keep refining your targeting, replacing low-performing keywords and creatives, and continuously analyzing your funnel.

# 8. Out-of-the-Box Ideas

1. **Influencer Collabs**: Partner with micro-influencers who match your target audience. This can drive high-quality installs more likely to convert to IAPs.
2. **Gamification**: If possible, create a referral system inside your app. Reward users who invite their friends with extra points or in-app credits.
3. **Seasonal Bundles**: Launch special holiday or event bundles. You can time your Google and Meta Ads to align with these seasonal offers.
4. **Communities & Groups**: Build a small community (Discord, Reddit, Facebook groups) for your app. Loyal users might spread the word and encourage new players to purchase premium features.

# 9. Final Thoughts

* App success in 2025 is not about just ASO or just ads‚Äîit‚Äôs the synergy of both.
* Track your metrics, optimize relentlessly, and invest in quality user experience.
* Paid ads won‚Äôt fix a weak product. Improve your UI, game mechanics (if it‚Äôs a game), and core functionality first.

The new flareup is a louder and higher frequency sound. It seems to get worse after I lie down . I am really worried and depressed at this unexpected outcome. 

Can anyone please shed some light on this situation ? If you had a tinnitus flareup while fasting, how long did it take to subside?  Thank you in advance for your help!",1,1736915984.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

LO is almost 4 months old and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what is causing the blood. He poops during almost every feeding during the day, but the blood will only appear maybe once a day and it‚Äôs only a small streak. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs CMPA related or maybe a fissure. I‚Äôll be talking with our ped about it, but just curious what others have noticed.

Long backstory of what we are dealing with: 
I‚Äôm exclusively breastfeeding with the occasional bottle of pumped milk. After his two month vaccines, he was having explosive, really liquidy poops. I chalked it up to the vaccines, but after a week of that our pediatrician said it shouldn‚Äôt be from the vaccines. I read a lot about rotavirus messing up babies, but my office said it wouldn‚Äôt last that long. I‚Äôm unsure who I believe at this point. They tested a diaper and found some microscopic blood, so they had me cut dairy for 2 weeks. LO was happy otherwise and had no other CMPA symptoms from what I could tell. During the 2 week dairy free period I noticed visible blood in his diaper. The day I noticed the blood, I had had an energy drink, but didn‚Äôt think anything of it. No blood for the next couple of days, but the next time I had something with a lot of caffeine, there was blood. I typically drink decaf coffee, but some days needed something more. I also stopped giving him vitamin D drops because the explosive, liquid poop would always be during the feeding that I gave him the drops. The explosions stopped, but his diapers continued to be have mucus. My ped isn‚Äôt too concerned about mucus by itself. After two and half weeks dairy free (and a diaper check by the ped that was blood free), I reintroduced a bottle of frozen milk that contained dairy for a few days. He seemed fine so I added dairy back into my diet. His diapers continued to have mucus, but there wasn‚Äôt any blood. At the start of the year, I had a cold brew and that day there was blood in his stool. I decided to cut caffeine, including decaf coffee. Something in the back of my head was also telling me it could still be CMPA related. I decided to full send it with dairy and have a glass of milk two mornings in a row to see how he would react. Overall, still a happy baby, but when he would poop he seemed in pain. Totally fine afterwards, but seeing the pain made me cut dairy again and see what happens. For the past couple of days he has had a little bit of blood, but pain free poops. If I wasn‚Äôt fully inspecting each diaper, I wouldn‚Äôt notice the blood. We have our 4 month visit at the end of the month so I‚Äôm planning on staying dairy free until then and talking with our ped, but I‚Äôm kind of at a loss. 

TLDR; I would make a horrible scientist, because I change too many things at once and I‚Äôm not sure what is causing the blood. ",2,1736915860.0,MSPI,1,1.0,False

I have since completed that, gone through a couple of industry related jobs while slowly building a network of very valuable people, with connections that could change my life (emphasis on COULD). They have been in the industry for decades, and they are starting to introduce me to others for work opportunities and it makes me very happy and proud to have this now growing network.

 Since visiting the UK a few years ago, I have gone back many times and every time I go I fall more and more in love with the city of London, the people, the culture, it‚Äôs hard to explain but I love the person I am when I‚Äôm there. People are kinder to me, therefore I become a nicer, happier person. I feel safer. Just happier. 

So, I‚Äôve been considering moving to London. But, I‚Äôm only in the first 4ish years of my career and I have dreams that don‚Äôt sleep (sometimes I wish I didn‚Äôt). My goal is to eventually score studio films and really gain a signature sound here in the industry, but I feel like moving to the UK may hinder that, in addition to the valuable growing network I have here. 

It may seem like an easy answer to some.. ‚Äúgo move if that makes you happy‚Äù but my dreams make me happy too. They are what wakes me up every single day. And I just fear wasted potential.. moving and disrupting my chances. Missing the coffee chats, the industry events, the spontaneous networking lunches. 

London is a big hub for film, but not in the same way LA is. Many people would to anything to trade places with me.

Die ,"Growing up, my family had a little black cat, who is now 14 years old. Once my sister and I moved out of the house, it was up to my dad to take care of the pets. He is an alcoholic and a narc, and I can‚Äôt classify my mom and sister as narcs but I would say they live in a similar headspace as him. None of these people are good with responsibility or proactively addressing problems. 

About 1.5 years ago, I was talking to my dad and he mentioned the ‚Äúfunniest thing,‚Äù he noticed that our cat had lost one of her front fangs. Like literally her big front tooth. This upset me of course, because it was apparent that my dad wasn‚Äôt taking good care of our cat. Who on earth would see their cat lose their front tooth and not take them to the vet? My dad is not receptive to advice, and our relationship is weak and very delicate. He‚Äôs a grown man, I cannot force him to do anything, and he will have to live with the consequences. 

Fast forward to today. My mom calls me, sniffling and groggy from crying, and tells me that we have to put the cat down because she has tumors in her mouth that have invaded into her jawbone. Immediately I am mad. This kitty has been living for years in pain, and I feel like while yes of course, she didn‚Äôt get cancer BECAUSE of my dad, she was not taken care of like she needed to be. My family are all completely surprised and shocked that our kitty has cancer, and are totally wrecked by the news, wishing they could ‚Äúdo anything to make her better.‚Äù  I am flabbergasted. A choice was made when no one took her to the vet many years ago. These are the repercussions. 

My sister is disgusted when I suggest to her that our cat has been sick for some time, she is immediately defensive and says how DARE I blame our dad, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what we need right now.‚Äù My dad is a lonely man who has pushed many away and barely sees anyone, other than a single friend, and me, when I meet up with him for a 1hr coffee approx 2x a month. The animals in our home are his only community, and I do understand this. But then why would he not take care of them and tend to their needs, when they needed it, and not when it‚Äôs too late? 

I think this is especially upsetting because I feel like growing up, I was the cat. I was seen as an important entity in my dad‚Äôs life, but not important enough to want to make sure I was good on the inside. Like the cat, there was never a thought given to my needs until it was too late. ",8,1736915743.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,0.9,False

My younger brother has been increasingly erratic, lying about anything and everything. He's recently had several violent episodes towards me, threatening to harm me and spouting crazy lies and I don't feel safe around him anymore. He begged my mom to host his new wifes birthday party here this last Sunday, i was never told and my mom surprised me that morning and i was mad but tried to be cool about it. It went fair until the end where he started lying to his son about how he got a Masters degree in only 2 years (hes never gone to college), then when i asked him when he did it he then told his son that i had memory problems because of my ""drug addict days"" (i never used anything harder than whiskey and weed) and how i was always violent towards him and our mom (never happened). How i should be careful what I say to him as our dad (a green beret) taught him how to kill (obviously it didn't happen). At that point our mom excused herself and i asked him to leave, he got loud and i asked if i had to involve the police. He dumped his cup of coffee on the floor and left without a word.

My nephew let me know he said i had been beating our mom and even our dad (long passed) never loved me. That i was a thief growing up, that i stole from everyone and never helped out the family. Well.. that was what my brother had done, he was the thief, he was the violent but charismatic one. Im the one who stayed at home and paid my parents bills. I was the one who had to get a job at 17, who never had a social life, who never owned nice things because we needed groceries and bills needed to be paid. I gave up my late teens and 20s to take care of our parents. He fucked off and never contributed 1 cent.

I refuse to allow him over, i love him but i hate him and dont want him to be around anymore. I dont know why his behavior has gotten so bad but i cant tolerate it anymore. My mom thinks im over reacting, that i should just allow it to happen and words cant hurt me. Well... its hurting me, people think i beat my mom, that i was a drug addict. It baffles me how his obvious lies are believed by some and tolerated by others, it really is a big deal.

so, our mom says I am the asshole. That i just need to tolerate it and allow him to visit again and that hes forgiven by her because hes stressed out (recently got fired and took a lower paying job). She says she mentioned to him that he needs to see a psychiatrist and maybe get on some pills, he refuses. I think im 100% justified in saying he cant come over until he apologizes and explains why hes lying about me. Our mom cares about HIS stress but not about MY stress.

I understand that most everyone would say im not the asshole but i just really needed to type out my rant. I miss the guy my brother was, when we were actual brothers. I dont understand why hes been attacking me with such crazy lies and why hes been lying about everything.

edit- this is MY home, 5 years ago i could no longer afford to pay her rent so i asked her to move in with me. Yes its a crappy little 2 bed and 2 bath but its mine.",22,1736915301.0,AITAH,38,0.93,False
