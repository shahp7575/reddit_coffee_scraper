I’m an Asian guy, 5’10”, pretty chill, and just looking to meet someone cool to vibe with. I’m not here for anything super serious right away — just want to see where things go.

I’m the type who enjoys late-night talks, spontaneous food runs, and probably overthinks movie endings more than I should. Bonus points if you can recommend good coffee spots or don’t mind a sarcastic sense of humor.

If you’re laid-back, open-minded, and like a mix of deep talks and dumb memes, we’ll probably get along just fine. Drop a message — let’s see what happens.

A few years ago, I didn’t think I’d ever make it out.  
I was the person pretending everything was fine — holding down a job, cracking jokes with friends, while quietly unraveling inside.  
The truth? Addiction had its claws deep in me.  

The real turning point didn’t come with a dramatic rock bottom moment — it came the first time I walked into a counseling session and *told the truth*. I remember sitting there, hands shaking, saying, *“I can’t keep doing this.”* And for the first time, I didn’t feel judged. I felt seen.  

That hour changed the direction of my entire life.  

---

Counseling wasn’t a magic fix. It was messy, emotional, and occasionally involved ugly crying over bad coffee. But it gave me tools — emotional armor to rebuild the version of me I had lost.  

Here are a few lessons that stuck:  

- **Recovery isn’t linear.** Some days I felt unstoppable, other days I questioned everything. Progress isn’t always about perfection — sometimes it’s about persistence.  
- **Honesty heals more than anything.** The walls I built to protect myself were the same walls keeping me trapped. Real freedom started the moment I stopped lying to myself.  
- **Support systems > Willpower.** White-knuckling recovery alone never works. Finding people who understand you — and holding them close — is what sustains long-term change.  

---

Once I saw how deeply counseling reshaped me, I knew I couldn’t keep that experience to myself. That’s why I created **Addiction Counseling: A Path to Recovery and Healing** — to share the lessons, exercises, and mindset shifts that actually worked for me.  

If you’re just starting your journey, or even if you’ve tripped a few times (we all have), this guide might give you the structure and encouragement you need:  
👉 [Grab the ebook here](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/3d4461955f)  

Recovery shouldn’t feel like a solo expedition.  
You deserve a roadmap — and a cheerleader who’s actually been there.  

---

A few chapters from the guide that readers are loving:  
- **“The Myth of Control”** — learning that surrender is strength, not weakness.  
- **“The Emotional Gym”** — where you build resilience like a muscle.  
- **“Reconnecting With Joy”** — because recovery isn’t just about quitting something; it’s about rediscovering who you are without the substance.  

If that kind of guidance speaks to you, I’ve made it easy to access:

I don’t have all the answers.  
But I have a story of falling down, getting back up, and trying again — and if that gives just one person hope, then everything I went through was worth it.

1ov1d07,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1ov1d07/i_finally_discovered_the_secret_to_beating/,I finally discovered the secret to beating procrastination and it was stupidly simple,"Alright, I have a confession to make. For the longest time, my ""study method"" was a brutal cycle of blissful ignorance for weeks, followed by a frantic, anxiety-fueled all-nighter fueled by cheap coffee and pure regret. I’d stare at a blank document for hours, convincing myself I ""worked better under pressure."" Sound familiar?

My breaking point was last semester. I had a 4000-word research paper looming for a month. I did everything except that paper. I reorganized my entire bookshelf by color. I deep-cleaned my kitchen. I even watched a three-hour documentary on the history of concrete. Anything to avoid starting.

Then, out of desperation, I tried something I saw on a random forum. It was so simple I almost dismissed it. The rule was: just work on it for 15 minutes. That’s it. No commitment to finishing, no pressure to write a masterpiece. Just 15 lousy minutes.

So I set a timer. And you know what? The hardest part was literally just opening the file and writing the title. Once I started, the momentum carried me. I found a source, then wrote a terrible first sentence, then a slightly less terrible second one. When the timer went off, I didn't stop. I kept going for another hour.

The psychology behind it is everything. ""Write a 4000-word paper"" is a monumental, terrifying task. ""Work on this for 15 minutes"" is a trivial, almost laughably easy one. It tricks your brain into starting, and starting is 90% of the battle.

I’ve been doing this for a few months now, and it has genuinely changed my academic life. The crushing guilt is gone. My grades are better. I even have more free time because I’m not constantly mentally weighed down by the things I should be doing.

The lesson I learned? Don't wait for motivation. It's a myth. Just do the stupid 15 minutes. Just start.

Route: Dartmoor → Exmoor → New Forest → South Downs → The Broads → North York Moors → Northumberland → Lake District → Yorkshire Dales → Peak District

Why it slaps for a week or two:

* Mix of cliffs, moorland, lakes and limestone so the scenery changes daily
* Short walks with huge payoffs: Seven Sisters, Buttermere, Mam Tor, Roseberry Topping
* Dark sky bangers in Northumberland and Exmoor
* Scenic drives like Buttertubs Pass and coastal lanes near Lynton
* Plenty of picnic spots and village coffee fixes

Quick trip facts: \~960 miles, 10 to 14 days feels right, May to September for long days, winter is great for stargazing.

I noticed that in the older episodes there was still some sense of respect... But in the newer ones (for example, **T23E03 · Treehouse of Horror XXII**, October 30, 2011), they literally show God serving coffee to the devil.

Of course, it’s not quite on the level of *Family Guy* or *South Park*, but it’s still curious how all these “dark humor” shows never make jokes about, say, the prophet Muhammad. In *The Simpsons* itself, as far as I could find, there’s nothing like that.

*Rick and Morty* even features an episode where they kill and profane the Lord... Yet, after a search as quick as the one I did for “Jesus episode Rick and Morty,” I couldn’t find any equivalent mockery involving the prophet Muhammad.

It’s disgusting how there seems to be a cultural tendency to specifically mock the name of Christ.  
Sure, not all the examples I mentioned focus solely on Christianity, but the frequency and intensity toward Christ are far greater.

May God have mercy on us.

If you’re planning to explore the magic of the **Abu Dhabi desert**, choosing the **right tour operator** can make all the difference.  
A great safari company ensures your trip is **safe, enjoyable, and truly unforgettable** — while a poor one can leave you disappointed.

To help you make the best choice, here are some **practical tips** to consider before booking your desert adventure.



# Check Their Experience and Reputation

When it comes to desert safaris, **experience matters**.  
A tour operator with years of expertise knows the desert terrain, safety rules, and the best scenic spots for sunrise or sunset views.

**Tip:** Look for companies that have been operating for several years and have strong reviews on **Google**, **TripAdvisor**, or **social media**.  
Reputation is often the best proof of reliability.

# Prioritize Safety Standards

The desert is beautiful — but it also demands **professional handling**.  
Your chosen operator should provide:

* **Well-maintained 4x4 vehicles** (like Toyota Land Cruisers)
* **Licensed and trained drivers**
* **Safety briefings** before dune bashing
* **Insurance coverage** for guests

**Tip:** Never book a desert safari that skips safety information or uses unmarked vehicles.



# Understand What’s Included in the Package

Not all desert safaris are the same — some include full camp experiences with dinner and shows, while others focus only on dune adventures.

Common inclusions to check for:

* Pick-up & drop-off from Abu Dhabi city
* Dune bashing & camel rides
* Sandboarding & photography stops
* Refreshments, BBQ dinner, and cultural performances

**Tip:** Read the package details carefully so you know exactly what you’re paying for.



# Look for Authentic Cultural Experiences

A good desert safari isn’t just about thrill rides — it’s also about **experiencing Emirati culture**.  
Choose a tour operator that offers:

* Traditional **Arabic coffee & dates**
* [Henna painting](https://www.abudhabi-desert-safari.com/henna-painting-in-abudhabi/), **falcon photography**, and **Tanoura dance**
* Opportunities to wear **traditional Arabic attire**

**Tip:** Operators who focus on culture as well as adventure create more meaningful travel experiences.



# Choose the Right Timing: Morning, Evening, or Overnight?

Each safari has its own charm:

* **Morning Safari** – Best for sunrise lovers and photographers.
* **Evening Safari** – Ideal for sunset views, BBQ dinner & entertainment.
* **Overnight Safari** – Perfect for stargazers and those wanting the full desert camp experience.

**Tip:** Discuss your preferences with the operator so they can suggest the best option for your schedule and comfort.



# Read Reviews and Real Experiences

Before confirming your booking, take a few minutes to check **customer reviews**.  
Honest feedback gives you real insight into the company’s service quality, punctuality, and hospitality.

**Tip:** Reviews that mention **driver behavior, food quality, and comfort** are the most helpful.



# Compare Prices — But Don’t Go for the Cheapest

It’s tempting to choose the lowest price, but in the desert safari world, **you get what you pay for**.  
Ultra-cheap packages often cut corners on **vehicle safety**, **staff training**, or **camp quality**.

**Tip:** Look for a fair, mid-range price with clear inclusions — that’s usually the best value for your money.



# Check for Licensed and Registered Operators

Always book with a company licensed by Abu Dhabi’s **Department of Tourism and Culture**.  
This ensures the operator follows safety, legal, and quality standards.

**Tip:** Licensed companies usually display their **permit number** or **tourism license** on the website or vehicle.



# Verify Pickup and Drop-off Details

A professional operator will clearly mention **pickup points**, **timing**, and **vehicle type** before your tour.  
Miscommunication can lead to delays or confusion, especially if you’re new to the city.

**Tip:** Always confirm pickup time and driver contact details a day before your safari.



# Customer Service and Communication

Good communication is a sign of professionalism.  
If a company responds quickly, explains details clearly, and helps you choose the right package — you’re in good hands.

**Tip:** Avoid operators who give vague answers or push for quick payments without clarity.



# Bonus Tip: Go Local!

Local operators in Abu Dhabi understand the desert better than anyone else.  
They know the safest routes, the best photo spots, and the real Emirati traditions — giving you a **genuine desert experience** that large corporate tour agencies can’t match.



# Final Thoughts

Choosing the right **desert safari tour operator in Abu Dhabi** is the first step toward a once-in-a-lifetime adventure.  
Focus on **safety, authenticity, and professionalism** — not just price.  
When you travel with the right team, the desert isn’t just a landscape… it’s a story you’ll remember forever.



# Plan Your Desert Adventure Today!

At [Abu Dhabi Desert Safari](https://www.abudhabi-desert-safari.com/), we combine **local expertise, safety, and warm hospitality** to create experiences you’ll never forget.  
Whether you want a **sunrise safari**, **sundown dune adventure**, or **overnight camp under the stars**, we’ve got the perfect package for you.

1ov14cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ov14cu/i_22f_am_not_sure_how_to_pursue_my_emotion/,I (22F) am not sure how to pursue my emotion towards my boyfriend (25M) early in our relationship,"I have been in a few relationships, that were all, for the most part, very messy. Almost all of them have been abusive emotionally or physically. My last “relationship” was on and off for a year. He was a 29M and it was definitely a weird situation to say the least. He was an alcoholic addicted to coke. I felt obligated to help him in whatever way I could, and it became normal to me. Eventually I came to my senses and ended things. My next pursuit( a year later) got me pregnant then ghosted me, I decided to terminate after the fact, this absolutely destroyed me. Months later I met someone, spent an exciting and passionate month with him to find out he had a girlfriend of 2 years.

Shortly after this I met my tooth ache-ingly sweet, lovely(very handsome) boyfriend. He respects my boundaries, makes me feel so comfortable being simply myself, and has never once made me feel less than and to some extent eager to hear/ learn about my past. Also is not an alcoholic, addict, does NOT have girlfriend( other than me hehe) and is pro choice, the bar is below hell, I know. It may seem small but he knows how I like my coffee, and is determined to make me a cup in the morning. He plans dates so specific to my likes it’s terrifying. We never run of things to say, he brings me little gifts that I wouldn’t have even thought to get for myself even though they’re perfect. If I want more than one thing at a restaurant he orders what I want so I can have both, same goes for literally everything. He’s patient. He’s soft. He’s in touch with his emotions. He’s silly with me. He’s thoughtful and kind to every person he meets. We share music taste and humor. We could enjoy sitting in a mud puddle in the middle of storm together. He’s open minded, and has a moral compass of gold. He’s the deepest most fresh of breath air. I started dreaming about him when I was 13. 

Although I’ve started to notice some self-destructive behavior from myself. I don’t clean up my apartment or clean up after myself. I can’t stop shopping or having the urge to spend money. I am constantly staring at my skin and picking at it. I don’t focus at work( I recently just got a big promotion so this extremely inconvenient). I hardly do laundry or even remember to eat. It doesn’t feel healthy for me to act this way. I feel like I’m being swallowed by this relationship and I’m having a hard time balancing my life. I have never felt so swept off my feet by a person and felt so strongly about a person. He feels like a piece of me I had no idea I was missing. I can see a life with him. I  see growing old with him. I want absolutely everything about him, even the flaws I can’t seem to find. 
It feels way good to be to true, I feel like the walls are going to crumble any minute now, I’ve expressed this to him a few times and he’s always very patient, very supportive and assures that he’s in it for “however long you’ll have me, a day longer or forever. Either way, it’s worth it and a privilege”

So how do I go about being more relaxed? How do I not let my previous experiences affect something so wonderful? How do I know if what I am feeling for him isn’t the burning desire of being seen and accepted for who I truly am, and being in love with the thought of it all or actually him( I feel very very much in love with him but I have asked myself this question more than once)?

I met “Sam” during my recovery from heart surgery and brain tumour recovery. He was my PT at my gym and we got on well. He then became my partner and his daughter’s PT also. We went to their wedding, kids party’s etc. There has never been any intimacy, mention of, or thoughts of during my 8-9 years of friendships with “Sam”. He played a very important role in my recovery and I feel I owe him a lot. We have minimal in common apart from the gym and both having young kids - so there’s absolutely no desire for more than friendship from ether of us. In fact, he’s the polar opposite of “my type”.

Lost a bit of contact the last couple of years with us moving away, not going to the gym, having a baby etc. 

Had planned to grab a coffee with “Sam” much to my partners horror. He says it’s a “date” and changes the rules of our relationship with regard to cheating and monogamy. I said he could come too but it’s feels a bit controlling.

During the course of our research, we took about 170 of the 200 photos in the book, which show examples of transparency, pigmentation, iridescence, bioluminescence, and fluorescence. Some things that make the book unique are that it draws upon the latest research, the photos show live animals (not preserved or damaged specimens), many of the displays — especially bioluminescence and fluorescence — have never been shown before. Along the way, we try to provide the chemistry and physics behind the photos, and dispel some misconceptions about ocean optics.

I feel like I'm wasting so much food at home now, because I'll prepare something, take a few bites of it, feel full and disgusted by the food, and then the rest gets tossed because I can't imagine any scenario where I would want to finish it. About the only thing that I've been able to enjoy with any amount of consistency is canned beef ravioli, which I'll eat out of a coffee mug. Doctor says that this is normal, and I admit that I'm still learning how to eat in a Zepbound world, especially as I'm still working through foods that I had bought prior to getting on Zepbound.

Even though I feel like I’m already sleeping enough, I often feel tired during the day. For example, even when I sleep 7 hours, wake up at 7 a.m., have breakfast, and drink a cup of coffee, I still feel exhausted and sometimes want to go back to bed.

Drinking coffee doesn’t always help, sometimes it even makes me feel worse. I get this weird queasy feeling in my stomach and a bit dizzy, which makes it harder to stay focused. I’ve also tried energy drinks like Red Bull or Monster, but honestly, they don’t feel good for my body, and I know they’re not healthy in the long term. I feel like sleeping 7 hours per day should be enough, and sleeping more would be a waste of time. But no matter what I do, I still feel a bit drained during the day.

In my country, because of the climate and lifestyle, we have a culture of taking a nap at noon, a short afternoon sleep. Almost everyone does it, and I’ve been used to it since I was a kid. Normally, I take a nap for about an hour, but sometimes I end up sleeping for two or even three hours. It’s a habit deeply rooted in our daily life.

However, I’ve started to feel that sleeping one or two hours in the middle of the day is quite a waste of time. My body seems to be used to this habit, and whenever I try to skip my nap, I feel extremely sleepy in the late afternoon and can’t concentrate on anything. On the other hand, when I do take a nap, I sometimes wake up feeling thirsty, dizzy, and even more tired than before.

I’m 20 years old now, and I really want to make better use of my time instead of spending so much of it sleeping. I also struggle with poor concentration and often waste hours doing random, unimportant things. I don’t want to let sleepiness control me anymore.

Lately, I’ve been trying to stick to sleeping around 7 hours a night. In the past, I used to sleep quite a lot , about 8 to 10 hours every day, but I would still feel sleepy in the afternoon.

I’m also taking medication to treat depression. Even though one of the side effects is difficulty falling asleep or having light, restless sleep, somehow I still manage to sleep very well. I’ve been making an effort to limit my phone use before bed and get a full 7 hours of sleep, but in the morning, I still don’t feel completely alert. lol. what's wrong w me?

So, I’m wondering that how can I maintain a 7-hour night sleep and reduce or even skip my afternoon nap while still staying alert and productive? Has anyone here experienced the same problem or found ways to break the habit of long naps without feeling exhausted?

Any advice, personal experiences, or tips would be greatly appreciated!",1,1762940157.0,sleep,2,1.0,False

Context: This was way back 2022. We’ve known each other for 3 years already. This started when my ex broke up with me after 4 months because she had sex with her ex. I met this amazing girl sa yellow app from an 8 years relationship. 8 years (boses ni Paulo Avelino sa IDILY hahaha) She’s really a nice person, wala akong masabi kundi I felt like when I met her I found my soulmate. She has a good sense of humor (like me), the way she dress, the way how she shows up, she’s a yapper but also a good listener. We dated for almost 4 months, she would take me to places I’ve never been, sunduin ko siya pagbaba ng bus galing Manila kasi nag rereview center siya for boards, go to our favorite coffee shop which is Tim Horton’s kaya nagustuhan ko ang Iced Double Double French Vanilla, it’s because of her. At madami pang car parked conversations that we considered as a date. But it didn’t worked out kasi alam kong ako yung gago during that time. I am not okay mentally and medyo magulo choices ko sa buhay. I also have a problem with my family because my mom was sick. I wasn’t at my best and she is. I know na na-fall na ako sakanya pero wala naman aayos sakin kundi sarili ko lang. Also, natatakot din ako during that time kasi shet 8 years yon nakakatakot teh. Nung natauhan ako na shet I want her mahal ko talaga siya, I was already too late. She didn’t reply to my messages kahit nag hahabol ako, wala. Then I saw from her ig story na nag soft launch na siya huhu sabi ko okay talagang game over na. Few months lang, bumalik ex ko asking to fix things. Pumayag ako sa hindi rin maintindihan na dahilan sa sarili ko??? Na up until today pinagsisihan ko siya kasi I could’ve fixed myself before when I was with the other girl.

I saw that she removed me from her socials so I just had to accept na lang talaga and move on from everything that happened. After a year of no contact nag reach out ako sakanya because I wanted to say sorry for everything she went through with me. She asked me out for a coffee to catch up, I said yes. Btw, this was year 2023. When I saw her tangina meron pa din. May kirot pa din kasi alam kong kahit kailan hindi magiging kami nito. Sayang na sayang ako. It was a good catch up naman kasi we’re talking about life after I graduated from college, tapos siya nag rereview pa ulit. I said sorry and she forgave me. We kept on saying na we’re better off as friends. So, natapos yung pagkikita na yon hindi na nasundan for that year. However, madaming beses na we would reconnect sa chats, not romantically naman but as friends. Most of the time siya yung nag rereach out to check on me or if ano na ganap sa buhay ko. Alam kong as friends lang yon. Pinipilit ko din naman sa sarili ko na as friends lang yon kahit may feelings pa din.

Year 2024 eto yung time na I was struggling with work and had to look for another job sa Makati. I was on night shift pa that time and had breakfast plans with HS friends sa isang mall. Natapos na yung kainan, nag stroll lang ako sa mall and I saw her. Kahit nakatalikod kilala ko siya. Nag panic ako kaya lumabas ako and she saw me pala when she was in her car. Of course she had to message me to confirm if ako ba yung nakita niya. She asked me out for lunch to catch up ulit and so we did. I was ranting sakanya about my work and relationship. Tapos during that conversation na-ungkat yung nakaraan namin, ang sakit pa din kapag napag-uusapan namin. Pero walang nag papakita samin na nasasaktan kami. So, ayun we’re okay naman as friends since pareho din naman committed. Napa-dalas ang pagkikita that year to bond and yap about life. There’s this one time we decided to meet again kasi parehong fed up sa work, I’m working sa corporate tapos siya sa construction firm since engineer siya. Na sa parking lang kami during that time and had a quick dinner lang din sa kotse, we’re talking and laughing the whole time. We kissed. I don’t know how it happened and why it happened. Pareho kaming nagulat. Her lips was the softest thing that I felt in this world. The next day she decided to stop talking to me and I agreed kasi we both made a mistake for doing that. That was September 2024.

January 2025, someone messaged me from an unknown number saying “Happy Birthday, I’m sorry. I hope life is treating you well” with a freakin’ yellow heart. Siya lang kilala ko na nag memessage sakin using that emoji. My guess was right. We talked again and she said she’s working in Ortigas, and that time I was in Makati na. May times na nag sasabay kami uwi riding a bus. Hanggang sa na-cut na ulit yung usapan kasi we had an argument. Palaging she’s finding reasons to cut me off. Nag reconnect again nung August just to catch up. Nabalitaan ko break na sila, inaya niya ko magkita ulit. October this year nabalitaan na niya from me na we broke up. Umamin na ko sakanya na I still have feelings for her and if there would be a chance for us hindi ko na sasayangin. She was overwhelmed during that time nung umamin ako. So, we dated several times. Even went to my home to meet my parents and cousins. That was the first time we did it, in my freakin’ bed. Tatlong taon ko nang mahal yung taong to and she also feels the same way.

I told her that I really want to pursue her, dun na niya sinabi na yung ex niya is asking her na bumalik sa bahay nila kasi they were living together before. Her mom also wants that girl to come home kasi naging belong na sa family nila. So technically they weren’t really over. The reason why they broke up is she told me na ayaw maghanap ng work and asa pa din sa parents. Meaning parang walang pangarap sa life. Tangina eto na eh invested na ko ng feelings at time sa taong to. Gustong gusto ko talaga yung taong to. Sabi ko sige I’ll give her time since she’s thinking about dun sa feelings ng family niya if bibiglain niyang iwanan yung isa. We’ve been going out weekly, palihim. Ang sakit pero nag tiis ako kasi nafifeel ko baka this time piliin na ko. I asked her after making love ""do you love me?"" and she said ""three years na kitang mahal"". Just this Monday lang, nung may typhoon nag work kami sa café aksidente ko nabuksan yung bumble app and nakita niya. Nagalit siya ng sobra kasi she thought ginagago ko siya. Wala naman talaga akong kausap sa bumble. I downloaded that app nung tinatry na naman niya icut yung samin and naiinis ako so I said what if itry ko idistract sarili ko.

Sobrang lala ng away namin. She found another reason to cut me off. I explained to her na wala naman talaga akong kausap pero sarado na talaga utak niya. She’s saying na sapat na yung nakita niya yung app. Ang sakin naman she’s not even dating me exclusively, sino ba committed diba? Umay. I wanted to hear some advice from you guys if this person is worth waiting pa ba? Kasi there’s a part of me na nag hohope pa din na ma-aayos yung samin. Pero at the same time takot din ako na baka gawin lang din niya sakin yung cheating na ginawa niya sa partner niya. I don’t know what to do.",1,1762940091.0,WLW_PH,4,1.0,False

I don’t have nausea, or anxiety (I didn’t have anxiety issues before), I have been drinking A LOT more water than I used to and I get bad dry mouth, I do feel my heart beating a lot faster in the evenings sometimes, and it was hard to fall asleep during the first week/week and a half.

I’ve been managing a local café’s Instagram account for about a month now. At first, engagement and likes were quite low — until I ran a breakfast giveaway post and boosted it with ads.

That giveaway post performed *really* well: lots of views, likes, and comments (though many comments were spam from the same people). After that, the account grew quickly — from 34 to 950 followers in about a month.  
A few posts after the giveaway also performed better than usual.

When I announced the giveaway results, I lost around 100 followers in a single day, which I expected — totally normal.  
But here’s the real problem: over the past week, my engagement and like rates have dropped by almost **50%**, and the account keeps slowly losing followers.

Nothing about my posting routine has changed:

* I post one story every day around 1–2 PM,
* And one feed post every night at 8 PM. I’ve been consistent with this schedule since day one. I use only 2–3 different hashtags per post, always varying them. The content is mainly coffee and food — high-quality, aesthetic photos and short videos that show the preparation process.

I haven’t changed posting times.  
Since I know how punishing Instagram’s shadowbans can be, I’ve been very careful not to do anything that could trigger it.

Now I’m stuck trying to figure out what’s happening.  
Could Instagram be penalizing me for the giveaway or the sudden follower spike?  
Maybe the algorithm has temporarily limited my reach?

I’m trying to stay consistent and post quality content, but it feels like I’ve hit a wall.

1ov0ckc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ov0ckc,AIO about a sticker my bf had of his ex ?? he broke up with me…,"!! very long read, it’s like 14 screenshots🥴 !!

I’ve never posted on Reddit before and honestly just wanted to rant, but I’m also wondering if I overreacted about the sticker**

My bf (28) and I (f 25) have only been dating for a few months. We used to be really active with dates and fun hangouts in the first couple weeks but now for the past 2 months we’ve hardly done anything but sit in bed all night and day watching tv or he’s gaming. He has been working overtime nearly everyday, been exhausted from it, and had to pay off some big bills. I am always very understanding of he’s too tired to go or can’t afford dates.

He promised me a date on Monday and I was stoked. His friend from back home came out to visit and my bf spent the weekend with him at the hotel. Because of that he was tired, spent a crazy amount of money, and due to Veterans Day he also didn’t receive his direct deposit. Therefore, come Monday, no date and another day spent bedrotting.

After I left his place we talked about it more over text.

**context about the sticker, I noticed it this morning and brought it up, he was kinda weird at first but took it off and I didn’t press into it. It was still bothering me later since she’s already come up way too many times in our relationship and it’s always been weird. I wasn’t going to bring it up but when he added the comment about the coffee shop I figured I’ll just say it to get it off my chest, next thing you know, he  breaks up with me! 

I know he’s not like obsessively staring at it or daydreaming about it but I just thought it was kinda strange that he sees it all the time when he’s doing homework and never thinks to take it off?? It’s right by the little mouse pad so it’s not like he only sees it when he opens and closes his laptop, it’s by his fingers the whole time? And it’s a full body pic of her sitting on the ground sucking a lollipop ?? There’s no other stickers on the laptop…just seemed a lil funny to me…his immediate shift in energy was even weirder tho. 

We had a 29 second phone call where I asked if he broke up with me over text, he said yes, I hung up and we haven’t spoken since(,:

I had this deep sense of intuition it wasn’t right but damn I still feel bothered about it. I had even wrote in my journal a few days ago I thought we might need to breakup. I tried to ignore it and give benefit of the doubt and make it work. Im not necessarily heartbroken, I’m a little sad and angry but I’m just stunned. My ego is so annoyed because I thought there’s no way he’s not gonna reach out to me again. But it’s 9 hours later and still not text…

Okay, let’s talk about something that *completely* shifted my energy game these past 30 days — the **Fit To Be Pregnant Plan**. I’ll be honest: I wasn’t expecting much. I’ve tried my fair share of digital guides that promise glow-up results and end up just… sitting in my downloads folder, judging me quietly from afar 😅.  

But this one? It actually delivered.  

From the first week, I noticed my mornings felt different — no crashes, no dragging myself to start the day. I was *awake*, like genuinely awake. By week two, my energy felt *limitless*. By week three, I started calling it my daily recharge ritual.  

Here’s *exactly* what surprised me:  

- 🌿 **Simplicity.** The plan wasn’t about overhauling everything I eat. It focused on nourishment that felt achievable (and realistic — hello, chocolate cravings).  
- 💪 **No gym guilt.** There’s an emphasis on movement, not punishing workouts. I loved the flexibility to adjust based on my day.  
- 🧘‍♀️ **Energy over aesthetics.** Most programs preach “bounce back fast.” This one’s about feeling your best *now*. That mindset shift alone was powerful.  
- 🧠 **Science meets sanity.** It explains the *why* behind every step — no weird miracle promises, just evidence-based tips that actually make sense.  

Thirty days later? My energy has *literally tripled.* I thought I was imagining it, but even my friends pointed it out — the “you’re glowing but not in a sweat way” vibe. 😂  

If you’re on the fence, I’d say it’s one of those few digital finds that’s worth adding to your wellness toolkit. I found my copy here 👉 [Get the Fit To Be Pregnant Plan](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b) — and seriously, it’s a game changer.  

Also, I loved how it’s not only for expecting moms. It’s optimized for *anyone* craving more balance, steady energy, and clarity — whether you’re juggling work, family, or just trying to stop feeling like a walking coffee cup. ☕  

**A few favorite takeaways:**  
- Hydration isn’t optional. You’re 80% water, act like it.  
- Morning sun is your new best friend.  
- Sleep isn’t lazy — it’s the upgrade you’ve been ignoring.  
- Eating clean doesn’t mean eating boring. (They have pancake recipes that’ll make you cry happy tears.)

Hey everyone,

My wife and I recently took the plunge and started our own café — Nukkad Farms and Café, tucked away in the beautiful Leopard Trail, Gurgaon.

It’s our first entrepreneurial venture, something we’ve been dreaming about for a while. We wanted to create a cozy, welcoming space where people can unwind, chat, and enjoy good food and coffee without burning a hole in their pocket — so we’ve kept the prices as nominal as possible.

Would love for anyone around Gurgaon to drop by, give us a try, and share your feedback. We’re learning as we go, and every bit of encouragement or suggestion helps. 🙌

All big things have humble beginnings — and this is ours. 💛

Sometime at the begging of this year I started noticing he had bad breath, but yk, that sort of thing happens sometimes in the morning, like I understand even if you brush your teeth sometimes the smell stays, or if you had strong coffee like you might be able to smell it sometimes. So normally I would just brush it off. However, it’s been about a year and it got to a point that whenever he talks near me I subconsciously back off bc it’s the first thing I can smell. Like it’s bad. Like chronic bad. And he would have it like all the time, even if he didn’t ear that day, or if he just ate, even if he just came from his house or whatever. I genuinely thought I was going insane because no one else would mention anything or no one seemed to mind. But recently I asked one of my best friends (that happens to be her ex, long story) and she said that yeah that she realized it too but they only dated for like a week so nothing really came out of it. 
My biggest thing here is, should I tell him? 
He has a new girlfriend now and I have no clue how his gf has not mentioned anything, like this isn’t a faint smell. Also he’s a nursing major he’s bound to talk to people and I don’t know how no one has brought it up, not even his family or other friends. And I know I am not going insane bc his ex realized it too. 

It might be something abt his liver maybe or like a medical condition but he didn’t have that before, like I just recently realized it sometime this year. 

Also I am really apprehensive abt saying anything bc he’s EXTREMELY emotional. Like he’s the type of guy that can’t take a joke, or doesn’t like to talk anything bad abt people, and if he’s in a room where a lot of people are talking ar once he has to go out to “decompress” so I know this is something he wouldn’t take well, and I don’t think I’ll be able to handle the conversation delicately or maybe he wouldn’t take it well from me. 

I was considering telling one of our mutual friends that’s also a guy cuz maybe he can say something, but I still don’t understand how no one has said anything up to this point. Like it’s so bad I don’t want to hang out with him sometimes and I don’t know if that makes me a bad person but it’s the truth.

Any ideas on what to do? Or should I just leave it and wait till someone else steps up?

I’ve noticed that I sleep quite a lot, usually around 6–7 hours at night, plus a 1.5-hour nap during the day. Even though I feel like I’m already sleeping enough, I often feel tired during the day. For example, even when I sleep 7 hours, wake up at 7 a.m., have breakfast, and drink a cup of coffee, I still feel exhausted and sometimes want to go back to bed.

Drinking coffee doesn’t always help,  sometimes it even makes me feel worse. I get this weird queasy feeling in my stomach and a bit dizzy, which makes it harder to stay focused. I’ve also tried energy drinks like Red Bull or Monster, but honestly, they don’t feel good for my body, and I know they’re not healthy in the long term. I feel like sleeping 7 hours per day should be enough, and sleeping more would be a waste of time. But no matter what I do, I still feel a bit drained during the day.

In my country, because of the climate and lifestyle, we have a culture of taking a nap at noon, a short afternoon sleep. Almost everyone does it, and I’ve been used to it since I was a kid. Normally, I take a nap for about an hour, but sometimes I end up sleeping for two or even three hours. It’s a habit deeply rooted in our daily life.

However, I’ve started to feel that sleeping one or two hours in the middle of the day is quite a waste of time. My body seems to be used to this habit, and whenever I try to skip my nap, I feel extremely sleepy in the late afternoon and can’t concentrate on anything. On the other hand, when I do take a nap, I sometimes wake up feeling thirsty, dizzy, and even more tired than before.

I’m 20 years old now, and I really want to make better use of my time instead of spending so much of it sleeping. I also struggle with poor concentration and often waste hours doing random, unimportant things. I don’t want to let sleepiness control me anymore.

So, I’m wondering that how can I maintain a 7-hour night sleep and reduce or even skip my afternoon nap while still staying alert and productive? Has anyone here experienced the same problem or found ways to break the habit of long naps without feeling exhausted? 

Any advice, personal experiences, or tips would be greatly appreciated!

A lil background - I was drinking quite a lot, especially when I was younger, later on in life I would gradually reduce frequency but still booze was present in my life 1-2 times a week, but I also had episodes of drinking every day for a week or so ( holidays etc ). Last two years and some I was on and off, say 2-3 weeks sober then one weekend completely wasted, however those hangovers became  terrible, and lasted for 2-3 days, also mentally I felt like shit and I think I started having some mild mental issues like paranoia, anxiety, depressing thoughts and the notion that I will not handle my life to the standards I would like. 
So basically I restricted drinking again because those hangovers were so painful and unbearable that it simply wasn't worth it anymore. I am about a month sober and I would love it to remain this way, but also I am sleepy,  tired, weak phisically and kinda unenthusiastic, my life so far didn't seem to improve as I hoped. 
Thought after a month my energy, optimism and happy mood will return, brain fog clear and all those magic things happen, but they didn't so far so a bit disappointed about that. Maybe it's worth adding I also quit coffee and cigarettes at the very same day which I was using way too much ( 2packs a day + 10-15 espressos a day ).

1. In that one little infodump-bit in I think it was ""Chutes And Murders"" (iirc the one where people were mad at her-Watsonianly-and-the-show-Doylistically for seemingly forgetting Turkey's on the Mediterranean sea given...Oz) was that part about the little Greek girl feeling bad about celebrating Easter a month apart from her friends or w/e supposed to imply Morgan's Greek and speaking from experience as on the one hand it's kinda oddlyspecific otherwise on the other hand there's nothing the show seems to have done so far otherwise to get the idea across of her being Greek (I understand if it might not want to touch the family's relationship to religion but at least it could be something like her wanting to share some aspects of that culture with her kids to help Ava feel less like a misfit as though Ava's part-Hispanic because Roman and Elliott and Chloe are part-[some-sort-of-Eastern-European] because Ludo since she's their common parent it'd be their common culture (and also maybe a joke or two snuck in somewhere about talking about it with [whichever of the non-baby siblings is most likely to have read Percy Jackson] meaning reminding them being part-Greek doesn't mean part-Greek-god))

2. What the hell is Karadec's heritage even supposed to be? I've never seen that last name crop up in my real-life before this show (but sometimes I've got too much anxiety to look things up about certain characters to see where it comes from) and the show hasn't really given us anything much on his past and doesn't seem likely to until the-S3-I'm-trying-to-make-double-sure-the-show-gets (someone high-up the show said something about exploring more character depth/past stuff for various characters in the too-long-back-half-though-I'm-happy-this-season's-this-long of S2 but Karadec was curiously the only one left off their list) so all I have to go on maybe is the actor's last name alluding to *his* ethnicity being Indian or similar (but there's nothing that could indicate Karadec's that way)

Not saying this show has to, well, treat all the character's heritages like how Jewish representation is done when badly written (iykyk) but if we know sorta the character's heritages is it too much to ask for some ways for them to be plot-important-in-ways-unconnected-to-racism so viewers who share that heritage could feel more connected?",2,1762936548.0,HighPotentialTVSeries,1,0.75,False

He responds that he met a coworker on this trip and has been anxious about having a conversation with me about her because he wants to be friends and doesn’t know how to be friends with a woman where it doesn’t develop into feelings. 

This man cheated on his first wife with a coworker. 

I say this to him and slowly over the course of the evening, the truth comes out. He was with this woman before the flight, ignoring my messages to have coffee and then he booked them both massages at a spa. The type where you get into robes and sit together in a communal area before and after going to a treatment room. He also claims to have picked up her phone number from work and has been texting her to play him in those VR headset games. 

I’m at a loss. He says it’s nothing and is embarrassed about my reaction. I’m basically having a meltdown because this feels like an emotional affair. He says he strictly just thinks this is a friendship. I have never had a reason not to trust him before but now that is all dissolving. He has lied to me, omitted key facts, still isn’t admitting to any sort of emotional wrongdoing. 

So am I over reacting? ",4,1762936271.0,Marriage,10,0.84,False

1. Last I was going to pune and was waiting for my bus on bus stand and suddenly one boy out of nowhere asks me about bus and after that he started asking me about myself like where you live and all (obviously I lied to him) then he asks for my instagram and I didn't know what I should do so I just gave him cause I thought he'll leave me alone then he looked at my pfp on insta and said that I look hot😭 and was asking for number then he was like teri bus ko time hai chal tuze coffee pilata hu gaadi h mere paas , fir maine bola meri bus agayi h muze jana padega he was literally following me around in bus stand 

2. fifteen days after this incident another guy near McDonald's came and started asking personal questions and then suddenly asks for my number I refused and left.

3. Just yesterday I was with my girlfriend we went to cafe and just left the cafe and were going to home and one guy comes on scooty and asks for address i didn't know and said search on google maps and he was like where are you from you don't look from here cause you don't know the address and he was asking for wine shop I told him about which I knew he said not that and suddenly asks for my number😭 my girlfriend was standing far but listening everything 😭😭. I refused to give number then he was like don't take this wrong way then my girlfriend couldn't watch what was happening and took me away from him.

My girlfriend and I were waiting in line when this random dude cut in front of us. I politely told him there was a line, and he turned around, looked at me up and down, and said loudly  
“Relax, bro. Be a man. You look like you couldn’t fight your way out of a paper bag.

Everyone around turned their heads. My girlfriend grabbed my arm and whispered, “Don’t say anything, let’s just leave.”

But honestly? That burned. Every guy knows that feeling when your ego screams to react, but your logic tells you not to.

I took a deep breath, looked him straight in the eye, and said, “Being a man isn’t about yelling in cafés. Enjoy your coffee, champ.”

The barista literally smiled and gave me our drinks first. The guy left red-faced. My girlfriend later told me that was the most attractive thing I’d done all week 😂

I used to think standing your ground meant fighting. Now I think it’s knowing **when not to**.

I don’t have a ton of counter or cabinet space to begin with, so I’ve been looking at under-cabinet wine racks as a possible solution. They look neat in photos, but I’m not sure if they actually save much space in practice or if they just make things look more “aesthetic.”

I’m not a big collector or anything, I usually have 4–6 bottles around at a time, mostly for dinners or when friends come over. My cabinets are the standard height, nothing fancy, and I’m a little worried about bumping into bottles or losing usable space underneath the cabinets for things like the coffee maker or toaster.

Has anyone installed one of these in a small or medium kitchen? Do they genuinely free up space, or do they end up being more for looks than function?",1,1762936098.0,HomeGear,0,1.0,False

I was reading that when you are in love it releases certain chemicals in our brain like dopamine, norepinephrine, etc. I noticed with this girl I was dating when I was with her I felt much more awake and present. It almost felt like I drank a coffee or something. At the same time I go for people that are low key kind of toxic or intense. I never understood why because it doesn’t seem rational but when the relationship is easy and there’s no push/pull type emotions then I get so bored. When I get bored I get tired so could it be possible that I look for these chaotic relationships because there’s a much higher reward for them since it’s “harder” or requires more effort. 

Considering orexin is involved in pleasure, motivation, wakefulness, could it be that being in love it elicits some sort of wakefulness? Can anyone share their personal experiences or thoughts on whether this is valid?",3,1762935578.0,Narcolepsy,0,0.81,False

**TL;DR:** Started cleaning my house before my son was born → accidentally discovered I love detailing → built a $1.7k setup and started a small business → now wondering if I should just go all-in or slow down and study first.

  
Everything started this spring when I began prepping our home and storage before our baby arrived. I made this plan to throw out, sort, and organize everything so it *actually made sense.* You know that kind of storage room that’s just a dumping ground for “maybe I’ll need this someday” stuff, mixed with childhood memories and random tools? Yeah, that was ours.  


Then I wanted to declutter the whole apartment—every drawer, every cabinet, every little corner. The goal: make life easier and calmer for my wife while she’s home with the baby, and also just improve our quality of life.  


I wasn’t hyped about it at all. It felt like a job. Checklists, planning, coffee… and for God’s sake, don’t forget your Vyvanse (Swedish version: Elvanse). Otherwise, what’s supposed to be a quick dump run ends with me fishing in a lake because I saw water on the way there.  


But once I started, something clicked. I felt good. Sweating, body aching, forgot to eat (thanks Vyvanse), but still felt great. Thought it was just dopamine. But it didn’t go away—I started craving it. Finding better solutions, optimizing workflows, getting nerdy about efficiency. Next thing I know, I’m on ChatGPT and YouTube, learning how to make things even smoother.  


What started as a boring prep project turned into… an actual hobby. What the hell? I *liked* it. It was therapeutic. It was interesting.  


Fast-forward to now: I’ve made my own cleaning chemicals (APC, fabric cleaner), bought around $1.7k worth of gear, and started a small hobby business. I do simple interior/exterior car detailing, sofas, mattresses—you name it. It started just to pay off my tools, but once they were paid for… I just kept going.  


Now I’m planning to expand—patios, tiles, facades, graffiti, trash bins, machinery, garage floors, the works. My goal is to save up for a van with everything installed. Right now, I’m running this from a sedan… which means every job includes 45 minutes of loading and unloading gear. And no, I can’t keep it in the car—baby stroller doesn’t fit if I do, haha.  


Then a friend asked: “Do you actually have experience or training in this?” And yeah… I’m self-taught. Just passion and curiosity. That question messed with my confidence a bit. I don’t have official proof that I’m good, just happy clients and before-after photos.  


If I mess something up (like when I used the wrong microfiber cloth and scratched a steering wheel recently), I always take full responsibility and fix it. I’ve worked in sales for over a decade, so I’m good with people and customer service.  


But sales never really fit me. I’m too emotionally tuned in. I want to *work with my hands.* I want to *see* that smile when someone looks at their freshly cleaned car or couch. That’s when I feel needed and respected. Sales just made me feel tolerated, at best, haha.  


Now I’m at this crossroads:  
I know I want to work for myself. I know I love this. But I also know I don’t have formal experience like others in the industry.  


So what would you do?
