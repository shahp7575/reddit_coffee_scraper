Title: Christmas in Maplewood: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Plaid

Plot:
Big-city marketing executive Ella Harper, who has 47 pairs of black heels but not a single personality quirk, is sent to the snow-drenched town of Maplewood to “revitalize” the failing Holly & Pine Christmas Tree Farm. Her boss, a corporate overlord who probably sleeps in a three-piece suit, demands results faster than Santa can say “reindeer union.”

Enter Luke Bennett, the ruggedly handsome, flannel-clad local tree farmer whose jawline could cut through ice and whose personality screams, “I’ve been hurt before, but I’ll still save a kitten from a snowstorm.” Luke is as charming as he is unshaven, and he immediately hates Ella’s PowerPoint slides and big-city ideas, mostly because they involve turning the farm into a parking lot for a chain of gluten-free coffee shops.

Cue the magical town of Maplewood, where every resident has a heart of gold and apparently no job because they’re all available for pie-baking contests, tree-decorating parties, and spontaneous caroling. Ella reluctantly participates, and wouldn’t you know it? She starts to soften. Maybe it’s the homemade hot cocoa. Maybe it’s Luke’s habit of chopping wood shirtless in subzero temperatures.

But just as Ella is starting to embrace the magic of Christmas (and Luke’s biceps), her boss shows up. He’s wearing sunglasses—indoors, obviously—and tells her to shut the farm down or kiss her career goodbye. Now Ella faces a tough choice: Does she stick to her cold, corporate ways, or does she fight for the farm, the town, and the man whose abs look like they were sculpted by Michelangelo himself?

Twist Ending: Ella discovers the farm has been secretly selling contraband eggnog to fund the town’s Christmas festival. She uses her marketing savvy to turn it into the hottest holiday drink in the region, saving the farm and earning her boss a massive bonus, which he takes credit for, naturally. Luke and Ella kiss under the mistletoe while a hilariously drunk Santa rides by on a snowplow.",1,1735934547.0,conan,0,0.99,False

Some of us will fight, some fall in love, but all of us will work and adore it, because all of us are inspired by the same thing.  The night that curtain goes up, it’ll go up on a smash hit.

Hi all,

Let me know if there is a better place for this but I recently opened a small coffee cart in LA and I’m looking to organize a fundraising event to help my friend pay for his dog's cancer treatment. He hasn't asked me for money but this dog means the world to him and I'd like to help ease the burden any way I can (I am not asking for money either). What I would like to do, however, is find the right event to sell my drinks and donate the proceeds to him for his dog's treatment/recovery. It's a survivable cancer but needs to be operated on. 

Does anyone know of any events or colabs that would make sense for something like this? I've thought of reaching out to an adoption event but I also would like to get decent foot-traffic so that I can send him more money. If there's a better place to post this, or you have/know of a good event or space for something like this feel free to comment or DM <3",1,1735934287.0,AskLosAngeles,1,1.0,False

1hsvf9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hsvf9p/friend_harboring_secret_old_resentments/,Friend harboring secret old resentments ,"I have been friends with A for several years now. We typically enjoy breakfast and get coffee together once a month, and text a bit in between, although not as often as I would like. Her schedule is quite packed with community advocacy, while I am a home body who loves to read, cook, dance, and generally spends most of my time alone. Our lives look quite different, but I have been appreciating our friendship, as she's one of the only people in my life who I feel I can open up to about challenges with work, family, health, or other issues. She's a great listener and offers good advice, and I try to do the same for her. 

  
We recently did our annual Christmas breakfast outing at a fancy restaurant, which is pretty far away, so I picked her up (she doesn't own a car) and drove us out there. While we were in the car, out of nowhere she says ""I remember two years ago we stopped at a river nearby and you told me you felt unsafe in my neighborhood."" I felt blindsided and things suddenly felt so awkward.  I asked her if she had some feelings about that and she kept reiterating that she felt safe there, and I reiterated that I still do not. It seems to me like this must have been a hurtful thing that I said, although she did not bring that up to me at the time, or even during this conversation. I'm now wondering what other things I have said over the years that may have upset her that she never brought up. I am also now replaying the many conversations we have had where she complained about other people saying things she found offensive or insensitive, including a recent boyfriend who she told me she didn't love but was staying with because being with him allowed her practice calling him out on things she wasn't okay with. On this same outing she was upset when we went to get coffee and she ordered a dirty london fog, and they charged her for the espresso shot, which seemed like a weird thing to get upset about, but I didn't want to make things awkward. Of course a coffee place charges you for the espresso you want added to the menu item. I'm seeing that she has a pattern if looking for bad intentions behind people's thoughts and actions, and I have no idea how to proceed. 

  
I have always felt a bit like I need to walk on eggshells around her, and our friendship has never felt truly safe to me, like I could just relax with her. When we are together, I mostly try to talk about things that are bringing me joy, while she mostly talks about her insanely busy schedule and the interactions she has had that left her feeling depleted. That said, I had cancer last year and she visited me in the hospital and during chemo. She has always been supportive of me and thoughtful, even mailing me cards and small gifts occasionally. This interaction during our last outing has me questioning the entire relationship, which hurts so much because before this she had been a truly bright spot in my life. I'm afraid if I try to talk to her about this she will become defensive and it won't end well, possibly ending the friendship. We briefly texted on Christmas but I haven't heard from her since then, and I don't know if she's just busy or if she also came away feeling awkward after our last outing. 

  
Can an outsider offer any perspective? I don't have many friendships and losing her would be a huge loss, but I also don't want to stay in relationships that aren't serving both parties out of scarcity. ",1,1735934228.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

However, I did not mention that I was single again (seemed a bit weird to announce it). He was “happy to hear from me” and said he would, however, that he lives in another city (about 1h from Berlin), so it might be difficult. This was about 3 weeks ago. 

Last week, since I thought I had to make a stronger hint that I simply want to meet him, I texted him again, saying I just crossed his city and had to think about him. We had a small conversation but it ended, at some point.  
  
Now I am a bit impatient. Shall I just wait until he invites me to an exhibition or should I approach him a third time and simply ask him out for a coffee? I don’t want to be too pushy though...

1hsveyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nobuy/comments/1hsveyj/recap_of_my_2024_low_buy_year/,Recap of my 2024 Low Buy year!,"https://preview.redd.it/5eoy7y5m3uae1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c2d6c3c798462730856d1bde0d19272811b6133

Hi everyone! In January of 2024 I set out to have a No Buy year. In reconciling all my spending data, I feel really good about the progress I made and wanted to share with you all!

My primary struggle area has always been eating out, so one of my goals for 2024 was to trim back the amount I was spending in that category. My other goals were to stop buying books, coffee, and impulse clothing purchases.

I also want to give a shout out upfront to a woman that majorly inspired my No Buy. Her name is Page Pritchard and she runs a podcast called the Money Love Podcast. I had been listening to her podcast in December of 2023 when she mentioned that her and her husband used to struggle with eating out. One day, they decided to try a challenge where they would indefinitely stop eating out. The challenge ended up lasting for months, and they broke their bad habit and saved a ton of money! My partner and I took inspiration from this and did the same thing (went from eating out multiple times a week, to not eating out for a couple months straight). I am forever grateful to Paige's inspiring podcast for this success!

As you can see from the 2023 vs 2024 comparison, I cut my eating out spend DRASTICALLY, which feels amazing. I will note that it was a lot easier to not eat out during the earlier months of the year (Jan-May), and then once summer rolled around, I fell a bit off the wagon. Also, when my job returned to office this summer, I got into the habit of buying food at work. Still, not nearly as bad as I used to be with this category. And a bonus, my partner and I started filling our time with learning how to cook new meals, which was a really fun adventure itself!

Even though other areas like clothing and entertainment are higher for 2024 than they were in 2023, the # of clothing purchases I made in 2024 was a lot less than 2023 (plus, the money was spent on high quality items that I needed). We also did more things this year like going bowling or to the movies, which I consider a better use of my money.

I basically tracked all my expenses daily (which I have been doing since 2021), and actually started sticking to my budget. At the end of every month, I would compile all my spending data (year to date) and look at how the #'s compare to what I budgeted in the beginning of the year. That helped me to see very clearly if I was meeting my goals. Also, saving money started to become thrilling, almost like a game, which helped make the whole No Buy a lot easier to stick to.

**Highlights from 2024:**

* **Cooked way more!**
* **Read existing books instead of buying new ones. Or, used the library.**
* **Pretty much stopped buying coffee altogether (used to buy Starbucks everyday, eek!).**
* **Stopped buying alcohol at the grocery store.**
* **Started doing more free activities, like hiking, going for nature walks, using the gym (paid monthly), and making lots of artwork (my side hustle!).**

**Goals for 2025:**

* **Up-spend in vacation and camping (I underspent in these categories compared to my goals). These are really special experiences for my partner and I (plus our friends), so I would rather enjoy these experiences than buying random stuff!**
* **Continue trimming down the eating out spend.**
* **Schedule quarterly check-ins with myself throughout year.**

I felt the division of labor in my previous marriage was unfair to me and am extremely cautious of putting my wife in the same scenario as a stay at home parent.


 This is making it difficult for me to ask for help from her when I need it because I feel like she's always doing more than me. She is from a middle eastern country and prioritizes cleaning amd taking care of ones spouse, so I feel like I'm always trying to match her efforts. 

For context, we only have our toddler with us 5 days a week. 

Her roles: 

Bathe and put the toddler down for a bed 3x a week

Put the toddler down for naps 5x a week 

Stay home with the toddler 3 days a week from 6am-2pm 

Home alone on the weekends and generally calls her family and relaxes

Off 2 days a week with the toddler and share the childcare load about 40% 

25% of cooking and cleaning

Bathe and put toddler to bed 2 nights a week

All of the household budgeting, bill paying and purchasing (she has access but prefers to tell me what she wants bought) 

All of the driving, including a weekly 3 hour trip to drop our daughter  with her other parent. I started teaching my wife to drive this week 

All of the grocery shopping

All of the bureaucratic/paperwork type stuff for immigration, loan applications, opening accounts, enrolling our daughter in programs, finding parenting classes, etc.

I’m not into dating apps talaga, hindi ko nga alam kung paano mag start ng convo.

May mga messages na akong natatanggap pero wala pa akong na feel na interesting ientertain until recently may naka match akong guy who looks descent and innocent, naging interested ako based sa looks lang, for me hindi sya gwapo pero he has the charm also walang ibang info sa profile nya kundi age at location. He messaged me, asked for my WhatsApp, and we started talking. Nag-iinvite siya agad for coffee (pero I said next time nalang) we continued chatting and nalaman ko pareho kami ng city, tapos abogado soya. Deep inside me ayoko maniwala na he is a lawyer but the way he carry the conversation, you would really notice how professional he is, he even joked at me kung may papanotaryo ako. Pero at the back of my head, parang ang hirap maniwala may lawyer sa dating app. Also first name basis pa lang namin na introduce ang isa’t isa.

Long story short, twice sya nag invite for a coffee pero na turn down ko :( sabi ko i’m not comfortable yet although I felt like I want to know him more. Di pa sya nag chat ulit after that convo, he said goodnight but there was “bye with kiss emoji” ano intention pag ganon? Hook up lang ba? Or is he giving me some space muna?

13 months and counting (extended to 2 yrs)

30 hours/week

Rigid schedule, no nights, no weekends 

Gym membership and cell plan paid

Whole new wardrobe as she arrived in a different climate than her home country so we took her on a shopping spree. 

3 paid weeks vacation/year. Family vacations with us she has the choice to come with us and participate, stay home and get paid to do kid related stuff for us, or take paid or unpaid vacation 

3 kids: infant 9 mos and 2 girls 2&4

Question:
My husband recently got a new job and we have to change the schedule for the first time in a year. We gave notice two months ago that this would be coming. We sit down weekly and have a coffee and chat about how things are going cover any questions or concerns and we have a good relationship, however we don’t ever get negative feedback from her. The only time we know that she’s upset is when she’s passive aggressive and socks spend extra time in her room if she’s upset about something. She is 21 and obviously doesn’t have the maturity level to discuss grievances with us we’ve also offered for her to write them down on paper. Write them in a text message to us as well. She’ll say everything is fine and soak for a few days and then get on with it and be happy again. The problem is that now that we are changing the schedule she appears to be very upset. It is in verbalizing it and it’s starting to make me upset because I feel like if I ask someone to work 30 hours a week I’m walking on eggshells and they are angry with me and I’m not willing to share my home with someone who is to help take care of my 2 older children if they whine about their hours still no nights, no weekends. Just an earlier 6am start 2 days a week and 2 afternoons a week to have the baby during his nap and the big two. 

I feel like we’ve been so generous with time, gifts, money, love and now that I’m asking for help I am being taken advantage of. 

Any thoughts?


Fwiw- same language. Never any major red flags. No other prior issues. Good person just lacking some emotional maturity that will come with time and the capacity to discuss issues that she may have

Throwaway account because I know my most current ex is in this sub.

Sorry, this will be a long post because I need to get it out of my chest and because I feel more informations will help.

Before I start explaining:  
I will call myself R (31F)  
My most current ex: F(33M)  
The dad of my kid: M (33M)

To prephase the situation: Me and M had been together for 11 years, but friend for 15 years and our son is 7.

While it wasn't a bad relationship per say, it wasn't good either. Not because of anything major, but M is in the army, so he was gone alot which put alot of strain on the relationship, me and our son. Other smaller stuff like bad sex even after seeing therapists, trying alot of differents stuff, etc. But since I didn't feel like bad sex was a good enough reason to leave, I stayed. Because in my head, a family is the dad, the mom and the kid living together (This will be important later).

That's when F came into my life. He joined the team I was in at my job, I trained him, through Teams because that was during the pandemic, in the beginning of 2022 and we instantly hit it off. Physically, mentally, sexually and emotionally. I had never felt like that before and I know it's the same for F, because we spoke alot about it. I never felt as safe as I did when I was in F's arms/presence.  
  
 While we were both in relationship at the time and while we did cross lines we shouldn't have, it didn't come more serious before mid 2023. I split up with M, while still living together in 2022. In 2023 me and F sold our houses and started seeing each other in 2024.

When I and F settled into our condos, we started seeing each other more frequently. Since we had waited so much, after looking back and it and talking about it, we jumped into the relationship way too quickly and we didn't take the time to learn how to be together as a couple, learning our boundaries, what was the definition of a couple for both of us, etc.

My ex, M was also leaving for a 6 months mission in june and recently came back in mid december. Which mean that I became a single mom again, which mean that it kind of sped up the timeframe I would've liked to get F acquainted to my son. In the end, it wasn't something negative because F and my son became buddies, but still, without the mission, me and F would've spent more time as a couple.

Now, into the relationship with F. F is someone that talks alot about his feelings, something I'm not used too. He's also someone with alot of intuition, he could sense when something was wrong and on my end, I wasn't used to talk about my feelings and that kind of stuff, so it was a big clash. 

For F, honesty was the most important thing. He could, eventually, take anything, as long as I was upfront with him. F didn't really mind alot of stuff, as long as I would talk to him about it.

But I wasn't able to always be upfront, not always because I didn't want to, but because I didn't know what I wanted, especially regarding the type of relationship I wanted with M, which caused alot of problems between me and F. F told me alot of times that if I needed time to know that I needed or wanted, to take it, but that if I told him that I wanted X, that I should be doing X and not changing my mind every few days/weeks. 

F told me that while he admired our, me and M willingness to be good parents for our son but that eventually, me and M would also need to focus more on our respective relationships with our partners. Not on the parenting side, but on the friendship side. That me and M couldn't really move on from each other if we would keep texting each other every days and sometimes use our son to do activities together because I felt like I was losing my family. F told me multiple times that me and M would always be a family, even if we didn't see each other every weeks or talk every days.

So, as you can guess, the reason why we argued and split was because I felt pressure from F when I couldn't do X like I said I would, because I wanted to please F but also please M with whom I wanted to have a relationship, which for me, meant frequently doing activities with M and our son, diner to each other's houses, etc.

So, in mid november 2024 me and F called it quit. We weren't living together so it made it easier. He went on a solo trip to clear his head and we didn't really speak that much even if we said to each other that we could atleast remain friends since we both felt like the love feelings were gone.  
  
I knew M was coming back, I knew M was going to break up with his GF and I knew that I couldn't have the type of relationship I wanted with M without pressure from F.  F made me realise that never fully mourned my family life which may have been the reason why F always felt kind of a third wheel during our time together.

When M came back, around he left his GF, we spent some family time and we did talk about the possibility of getting back together. I will add that nothing physical or emotional happened between me and M since he came back, because I don't want to confuse M, myself and also because physically, I'm not attracted to M anymore.

It's something I had thought before because of what F told me multiple times, but since now I didn't have any outside pressure, I could focus on knowing if what I missed was family time, or M as a boyfriend.

Eventually, F contacted me because I still had some of my stuff at his house and also because he had some questions for me after seeing his therapist and he wanted to ask them to me face to face because we hadn't seen each other since mid november. The break up had been done via Teams because I was scared that if I had done it in person, I would've cried and I knew that F would've took me in his arms and that I would've wanted to stay.

F asked me to meet him at the mall, because he wanted a neutral ground for both of us to feel a bit more safe and comfortable. His questions were nothing out of the ordinary, like what kind of friendship did I want with him, if I still wanted one, etc. and that the hardest thing for him wasn't losing me as a lover, but losing me as a friend and a confident.

Eventually, we made our way back to his house, so I could gather my stuff, but when I walked into his house with him, feelings hit me hard. it was around supper time, so I ate at his place and we kept on talking. 

F felt that I was sad and he asked me if he could do something to help or if I wanted to leave, so I asked him if he could stroke my hair. When F would stroke my hair, every problems in the world would go away. F said that he was happy to spend one last time like that with me. That's when my brain shut off and told him that I didn't ask him earlier because I didn't want to hurt him. When F asked me what I meant by that, I said that I would like to spend FWB time with him but that I knew he was a lover and that I was scared to hurt him.

F laughed, said that I was right, that he would've been hurt if this would've happened right when we split up because he still had feelings and that while 6-7 weeks didn't erase them, he knew that even before we called quit, we wouldn't be together in the long run and that if a FWB would happen, if he were to catch feelings or wanted more, he would tell me so that we could call it quit. Then he kissed me. I left around 8:30 PM and nothing else happened.

I made it pretty clear to F that if the FWB situation would confuse me more than I was, I would pull the plug, that I didn't want any pressure, nothing complicated and that it wouldn't see each other on a regular basis, like every friday, etc.

Fast forward to wednesday. F had previously told me that he would take me on the FWB offer and asked me to go to the restaurant with him and depending on how it would go, that we could go back to one of our places. We ended up at mine because the evening was just like me and F started seeing each other. We eventually ended up having sex but I could feel that F wasn't as emotionally invested as he used to be when we were together. I made the comment out loud and F asked me if I wanted to have sex of if I wanted him to make love to me and that he would adjust accordingly.

After we finished making love, we spend most of the night talking and laughing, like we used to do and I fell asleep in his arm and he left in the morning after making me my coffee like he used to do when he would spend time at my place and kissing me on the forehead. 

We spoke alot about the fact that we didn't really had the right cards to be together but that splitting up was the right decision, that for both our mental health we sould've done it sooner but that being together like that still felt good.

I texted F because I wanted to make sure that he didn't expect more, etc and his answer was that he didn't want more because currently, he was in therapy, that he didn't know what he wanted for his next relationship, that he wasn't there yet but, he ended the text by saying that since we weren't together, I should think about why I wanted him to make love to me, for him to take care of me like he used to do when we were together.

I still don't know what to answer to that question. I'm obviously very confused, my friends are only saying that they are ""team R and M"" and me therapist simply told me that it was possible to love more than one person at the time.

M knows that I will spend time F from time to time, I didn't tell what kind of time I would be spending with F, but I said to M clearly that I wasn't ready for anything serious, that he shouldn't wait for me because like I said above in the post that I didn't know if I only missed the family time or the time with M as a boyfriend.

On F end, he only said that I should stop asking him if he was ok or if he was catching feelings because it gives him the impression that I still have some feelings for him and that he'd been the third wheel long enough so he didn't want to be part of any possible drama between me and M for whatever reasons.

TLDR: I'm thorn between what I think is the man of my life, M and what is my soulmate, F.

I was gifted a Fellow ODE brew grinder several years ago and simply didn’t know it needed regular cleaning/maintenance. I’ve used it pretty much every morning since, including a couple drops of water on the beans to reduce static cling/errant grinds.

As you may expect, the grinders performance declined over time so I looked up how to maintain it. I bought some replacement V2 burrs and opened it up today with the intent to give it a thorough clean, only to find some bad news:

Mold.

Instead of fine, brushable coffee grinds that can be easily wiped out with a brush, there are spots where the grinds are caked on and rock hard. When I pick it off with a toothpick, there is what appears to be white mold underneath 😬

Now, I’m replacing the burrs and can deeply clean any pieces I can remove, but some of the mold is deep in the “barrel” of the grinder behind the rear burr. I can pick out most of what’s caked on with a toothpick, but I’d like to be more thorough about cleaning it given what I’ve found…

1) How do I get deep into that barrel with more than just a flimsy brush?
2) Is there a cleaning solution that y’all would recommend to make sure it’s clean, given what I’ve found?
3) How do I prevent this from happening in the future? I hate the static-y grinds that go everywhere when i skip the water drops, but I definitely don’t want to recreate the mood situation…",0,1735933330.0,JamesHoffmann,1,0.5,False

From coffee, tea, hot chocolate and speciality drinks, they've got a drink for everyone.

**Here are the steps to get a free drink voucher (or two if you link a Waitrose account) with Caffe Nero**
1) [**Sign up on a mobile device**](https://nero.app.link/bx2XynNkRPb)
2) Purchase a drink via the app. The cheapest option seems to be an espresso, priced around £1.50. After your purchase, a free drink voucher will appear in the app under wallet/rewards.
3) Create a free MyWaitrose account and enter your MyWaitrose account number into the Nero app (go to settings > my linked Waitrose card). When you redeem your free voucher in the app, you should receive another free drink voucher for linking your MyWaitrose account - I have tested this and it worked!
 
**Optional Step: You can get 25% off barista-made drinks and freshly baked pastries at Caffè Nero.
Follow these simple steps to unlock 25% off without spending a penny:

1) **Do an Insurance Quote:** Go to Compare the Market’s website and start an insurance quote. All you need to do is get a quote for travel insurance, this whole process took me no more than 3 minutes. Don’t worry, you don’t have to follow through with the purchase—just getting the quote will give you access to Meerkat Rewards.
2) **Download the Meerkat App:** Once you’ve completed your quote, download the Meerkat app on your phone. It’s available for both iOS and Android users.
3) **Create an Account:** Sign up for an account using the same email address you used to get your insurance quote. This is important because the system will link your email to the quote, even if you didn’t buy anything.
4) **Verify the Quote:** Once logged in, you should see your quote pop up in the app. It doesn’t matter that you didn’t make a purchase—Compare the Market’s system isn’t sophisticated enough to check whether you actually bought the insurance. Simply clicking through the quote is enough to activate your access.
5) **Access Meerkat Rewards:** When you head in to order your coffee and pastries, click “get discount code” within the Meerkat app and scan the QR code. Your discount will be applied automatically. You can use the offer up to two times a day to get your caffeine fix, and the codes are valid every day of the week
 
After completing the steps above, you’ll have unlocked your Meerkat rewards, and you’ll have access to this benefit for a full year

1hsuxzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1hsuxzr/got_called_a_female_dog_cause_she_couldnt_wait/,Got called a “female dog” cause she couldn’t wait ,"We went to two drive thrus and I have to hold all of it while using her phone for everything like ordering then getting directions 

I was trying to get it sorted out after we got the last thing we needed and she’s shoving her trash into my face even tho there’s a bag she could put it into that I’m holding.

So she lunges over and tries to aggressively shove it into a bag. I grab her hand and tell her to wait. I had to drop her phone wherever to take the trash from her and put it into a bag.

That’s where I got called “female dog”. And it wasn’t that long ago where she had a freak out episode because McDonald’s didn’t have and vanilla coffee. Instead of just saying no thank you and that she no longer wants it , she speeds up as the lady asks if we still want the coffee after we order our food.

She just speeds up and when the lady asks at the window, she yells no. I told her that she needs to knock it off because they have a policy that allows them to deny service if they get mistreated.

I got yelled because of course she’s not the villain here. The employee is for “being rude and also making her wait for five seconds to order.”

1hsuxd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1hsuxd3/vitamins_and_supplements/,Vitamins and supplements,"Looking for some thoughts and feedback on vitamins and supplements. Over the past several years, bloodwork showing deficiencies has resulted in me going on a multivitamin (2 a day for full dosage) B-12 (1 a day) and D3 (label recommends 2 a day, but take 1 a day since I'm also on the multivitamin) I also started taking Neuriva over a year ago as I don't quite feel as sharp as I age, (side note on that: didn't feel any difference when I started taking it, but when my local store was out of stock for over a month, I did notice a clear difference coming off of it) I was also taking magnesium citrate, which helped with joint pain, but stopped that about a month ago when I did additional research after seeing a discussion recommending it for managing constipation. Constipation is definitely not an issue for me. I spread taking everything throughout the day both for more gradual absorption and to not hammer my gut with everything at once. Gummies for the multivitamin and B-12, caplet for the D3, hoping for form with maximum absorption for the short time it has passing through me.

Current status is second home application of Skyrizzi will be next week, November was the first one after the infusion starters; have seen only minor improvement since switching after the Stelara stopped working. Long story short (I know, too late) about a week ago, going to a friend's house for the day, I forgot to take anything in the morning and didn't bring anything with me, ended up taking all of my supplements when I got home around 6:30, and around 10:30pm turned out to be the start of a rough night. Testing a theory, I cut out all of the supplements for 3 days and went from 2 to 1 cups of coffee a day. On days 2 & 3, movements were still slow in coming and still very wet when they occurred, but total movements were 2-3 total for the day, and morning only, which is close to as manageable as my symptoms get since starting biologics. Started the supplements back up on Wednesday, (still keeping to single cup of coffee) and it's been 4-6 movements a day, including morning, afternoon and evening.

2 questions: 1. Any thoughts on how to get the nutrients I need? Am I wrong to think gummy form is the way to go? I know things don't spend long in my body, so I need quick absorption, but does anyone have experience with forms that are both gentle and quick absorption? 2. From what I've been able to find, magnesium glycinate does not have the stool softening effects of magnesium citrate, plus it's cited to help with some of my other issues, including fatigue, anxiety, stress, and depression. Does anyone have any experience with magnesium glycinate?",1,1735932974.0,CrohnsDisease,1,1.0,False
1hsuxcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/1hsuxcc/cats_starved_5_days_by_sitter/,Cats starved 5 days by sitter,"My wife and I traveled to visit family for Christmas and were gone for about 7 days. We had used rover multiple times before but our regular sitter was unavailable for Christmas so we picked someone else with really good reviews. A week before our trip, the sitter from hell who we would call Alice came for a meet and greet to meet the cats, get feeding instructions and get the keys to the apartment. Alice came with her wife and it was a pleasant visit. During this meet and greet , my wife and I went over very clear feeding instructions. We let her know that our automatic feeder was broken so she would have to fill up their dry food bowls every day and we also told her that they each get 1/4 of a can of wet food, watered down, every day. Alice, her wife and I listened as my wife gave the feeding instructions. In addition to the feeding instructions, I remember my wife telling Alice that our cats like brushes and showed Alice where we keep their brush, in a cart right beside their feed station and right on top of the wet food so they easily find the brush.

We went on our trip and everyday, Alice sent a daily checkin card and multiple pictures of our cats. The daily check-in card said that during the visit there was 1 poop stop, 1 pee break, 1 meal break, and 1 water break for both cats. Since it was the Christmas holiday, we understood everyone would be trying to spend the most time with family and so there was hardly any communication from Alice but we saw the daily checkin cards and pictures of the cats. On the last day of our trip, we noticed that the pictures we were sent had the automatic feeder in the background and their food bowl was empty. We looked back at other pictures from prior days and the food bowl was always empty. We assumed the pictures were being taken before the bowls were filled and since we assumed they got their wet food daily, we were not alarmed.

At the end of our trip, when my wife and I arrived home our cats were clearly very distressed and lethargic. Their dry food bowls were both empty, the wet food bowls and wet food cans lid we laid out for the sitters hadn't been touched, there were still the same number of cans of food, there were no empty cans of cat food in the garbage, and they should have finished the remaining bag of dry food and opened up the new one I left right next to it, but the old bag still had dry food in it.

We immediately reached out to Alice and she said she thought we had them on an automatic feeder and her wife and her do not recall us mentioning the wet food. She admitted that she didnt feed them ANYTHING! She starved our cats for 5 days!!! Our poor babies haven't had anything to eat since the dry food that we left in their bowls ran out. My heart still breaks thinking about this. Alice and her wife visited everyday, lied on the checkin cards that they was a meal break and sent pictures, meanwhile our cats had nothing to eat all the while we we were on our trip. We have a litter robot and didn't need pet sitters for poop, the sole reason we got them was for feeding. Our cats are out whole world, there is absolutely NO WAY we would have neglected to tell Alice any important feeding information. We even asked if she had any questions or concerns about it before she left and she said no.

We reached out to Rover and they haven't been helpful so far. We expressed that we are extremely angry and sickend that the cats were put on a life threatening situation, not to mention the mental and emotional anguish of being starved for days. We asked that at the minimum, Alice needs to be removed from the platform because she is reckless, lacks listening skills and frankly common sense and can put future animals in danger up to potential death. I mean, her anf her wife didn't have the common sense to notice that the food bowl was always empty and maybe ask us questions. We saw an empty coffee cup one of them left in our trash which was right under the wet food station we left for them that had cat food bowls, leftover food cover with a cat on it and yet none of them saw that and wondered why we have that setup and if they should be feeding the cats some wet food.

Rover is saying pet sitters are independent small business owners and so we need to ask them back for the money. We reached out to Alice and she's only offered a partial refund but I am honestly not satisfied with that. She is also blaming us for not leaving a note reminding them about their feeding instructions, This meet and greet verbal instructions is the same we've given to all our previous sitters with no issues. I need to know what our options are. We still haven't come to an agreement and I wanted to see if anyone had ideas on what we can do? Do we have a legal case here?

For anyone wondering, we are not sure if the cats have any longterm damages from being starved. They are eating and drinking fine for the most part. One of them had bloody stool and we're currently at the vet to check him out to see if anything is wrong. Please leave advice on how we can get some accountability for the harm done to our cats from Rover and Alice. Thank you.

Episode 2: Truth or Mutant Shark

""Last time, on Total Drama Revenge of the Island! Thirteen new competitors were blown away by this year's challenges. They were treated to an early-morning swim, said hello to the island's wildlife, and did some totem-surfing. Ex-plosive!""

""In the end, Staci's team got so sick of her nonstop tall tales, that they sent her packing, Hurl of Shame-style.""

""Who'll go home next? And how much pain can I put them through first? Find out right now, on Total! Drama! Revenge of the Island!""

(Theme Song)

The episode opened on a shot of the morning sky and a few far-away bird calls, a couple sharp notes playing as the camera panned down to the two cabins of Camp Wawanakwa.

“Really?” the voice of Dawn spoke out before the shot cut inside to the girls' half of the Rats' cabins where a blue bird was shown chirping before the shot zoomed out to show a fully-clothed Dawn hanging upside down and having the bird stand on her hand. “Oh no!” the moonchild replied in horror.

Dakota was shown in a lower bunk along the right wall, her hands covering her ears in order to block out the chirping and a sleeping mask over her eyes. “Will you keep it down? If I don't get my beauty sleep, I'll lose it!”

“Yes. Because your need for fame is really a depressed cry for love,” Dawn said.

“Who told you that? My therapist?” Dakota asked in surprise.

“I see people's auras,” Dawn explained. “And it looks like someone threw up on yours.”

“Oh, go eat a worm!” Dakota groaned in frustration and covered her face with her own pillow.

Confessional: Dawn

Dawn was sitting cross-legged in the confessional, the bird from earlier sitting on her finger. ""Me and Dakota are nothing alike, and despite her need for attention, I could see us becoming good friends in the future.""

It was then that the bird coughed out a worm and offered it to the aura whisperer. “Uhh, no thanks,” she declined the offer.

Confessional Ends

The shot cut abruptly to a top-down view of the other half of the Rats' cabin, Noah sleeping quietly on a top bunk on the left, Beardo making a breezy noise through his mouth in a top bunk on the right, and Tyler snoring away in the lower bunk. The camera cut in to a close-up of the klutzy jock, and the sound of a door suddenly slamming open and shut startled him enough to wake up and look back.

It was Alejandro – flat against the front door with his eyes wide, his breath heaving, and his clothes dirty. ""Dude, what happened to you?"" Tyler asked in concern.

Alejandro quickly became calm enough to smile. ""I simply went out for a morning jog,"" he explained.

""Then what’s up with the dirt all over you?"" Noah said, suddenly sliding next to the latino.

“Well…” As Alejandro started to speak, the footage quickly cut to a scene of him running from a Woolly Beaver – one with several boney spikes jutting out of its back. The shot flashed back to the Rats' cabin, and Alejandro said ""I tripped on a rock and it resulted in my clothes getting like this.""

""I feel you,"" Tyler said as he walked over to them. ""I trip over a lot of things, even wires.""

Confessional: Alejandro

""Admittedly,"" Alejandro admitted to the outhouse camera, ""I was actually trying to find the McLean Brand Chris-Head,"" he said. ""I have a lot of plans for this season, and should I experience a flat tire, I can use that head to give it some air,"" he finished with a smirk.

Confessional Ends

The camera cut back outside the cabins, zooming on on the Maggots' abode on the right then cutting inside to show Lindsay applying her lip gloss with the aid of a hand mirror.

Emma walked up behind her from the left. ""Good morning,"" she greeted.

""Good morning Emily!"" Lindsay replied. ""Hey, do you have a blow dryer I can borrow?""

""Emma,"" Emma corrected in frustration, ""and no, I don't. All my blow dryers got confiscated by Chris.""

""Aww,"" Lindsay pouted. ""I guess I'll have to do without,"" she added, looking uncertainly at her reflection again.

The scene flashed to the boys' side of the cabin, the camera focusing in on Mike as he slept on the left wall while snoring before inhaling into Chester. “These young whippersnappers with all their yammering and tomfoolery.”

Mike returned to himself after another inhale. “Aw, c'mon, Chester, keep it down.”

Inhale. “Fine. For now.”

The shot moved over to the right wall as Mike continued to sleep, where Cameron's eyes peered out of the depths of a cocoon-like red sleeping bag on a lower bunk on the right.

Confessional: Cameron

I had a hard time falling asleep,” Cameron explained as he squirted hand sanitizer on his hands and began rubbing them. “It was my first night outside my bubble. But finally, I recreated it with my sleeping bag, and I was out like that! What an adventure.”

Confessional Ends

The scene moved back outside the cabins once more, then up to the top of a tall pine tree where Shawn was sleeping on a thick branch, a rope tying his leg to it.

Confessional: Shawn

""I'm not one for sleeping in beds like the ones in the cabin,"" Shawn explained to the outhouse camera. ""Spending the night with a bunch of strangers who could turn into zombies while I'm sleeping? No thank you!""

“The person I'm most suspicious about? Axel,” he continued. “She gives off huge vampire vibes.”

Confessional Ends

The footage returned to show Axel in the middle of a morning run, then back to Shawn as he woke up with a sudden yawn, stretched his arms, and untied himself in order to land on the ground.

A squirrel sitting on another tree branch looked from one contestant to the other. It closed its eyes as Axel was heard crashing into Shawn, then laughed and climbed up.

Its laugh was still heard as the camera cut to the two teens on the ground, Axel rubbing her head and Shawn glaring at her.

“I was in the middle of my run!” Axel scolded. “Why'd you crash into me?!”

“Crash into you? I was just getting off my tree!” Shawn responded. “You should've watched where you were going!”

The two of them both got up. “What are you even doing out here instead of your cabin?” Axel asked.

“I happen to sleep outdoors,” Shawn explained. “This tree is my bed.”

“And you didn’t even pitch yourself a tent?” Axel continued in disbelief.

“I want to be alert for any kind of supernatural beings,” Shawn told the survivalist. “If I’m indoors, they can totally sneak up on me. No way am I gonna be an undead snack.”

Confessional: Axel

“That conspiracy theorist sure has a few screws loose,” Axel muttered. “But anyway, he’s one of the more useful members of my team in comparison to the rest, and as long as he doesn’t get in my way, I might have him be my partner when it comes time to survive in the wilderness.”

Confessional Ends

The scene cut to a seagull sleeping in a nest inside the horn of a loudspeaker. A blowhorn sounded through it without warning, though, forcing the bird out into the air and revealing its snake-like features as it fell.

""Up and at 'em, my little morning glories!"" Chris called out, sitting on his ATV below. ""It's time for today's challenge!"" he announced, the camera moving behind him to show the two teams assembled in front, their respective logos appearing on the screen overhead.

""Right now?"" Noah asked dryly. ""We haven’t exactly gotten to the most important meal of the day.""

""And I haven't had enough beauty sleep!"" Dakota added, sunglasses hiding her eyes.

""I’m sure you look-"" Tyler began to tell her before she revealed the horrible bags beneath her eyes, causing the jock to recoil and scream in fright.

""You can catch up on your sleep after the challenge,"" Chris told him before pointing off to the left and smiling. ""Right this way, to the Bay of Dismay!""

The twelve campers groaned, and Dakota pulled out her phone.

""Hey, it's me. We're going to some bay-"" the fame monger started to talk until Chris used a magnet to take her phone away. ""Hey!""

""Contraband! Now it's mine! Confiscator's keepers! Come on! Your humiliation awaits!"" Chris told a miserable Dakota.

The scene flashed ahead to the twelve campers walking along at an even pace. ""'Bay of Dismay'?"" Lindsay told Mike as they walked side-by-side. ""I hope it’s not a fighting challenge. I just did my nails.""

""Totally,"" Mike nodded. ""I’m not the most athletic person out here as you can see.""

The camera lingered a few seconds as they walked off, long enough for Tyler and Dakota to enter the shot together. ""Hey, sorry about wazzing out earlier,"" Tyler said. ""I never expected you to be the type of girl who has eye bags, but they’re as cute as you.""

This comment caused both of them to feel awkward.

Confessional: Tyler

""Seriously?"" Tyler said in the confessional, bewildered by his own words. ""The hottest girl on the island, and I mess up my own words?""

Confessional Ends

Dakota gave her teammate a confused look. ""Thanks!"" she said hesitantly as she looked the nervously smiling klutz over. ""I like your, uh...,"" she trailed off, unable to find something to compliment. “Can I get back to you on that?”

Dakota continued ahead, and Tyler smacked himself on the head as Cameron and Axel walked past him.

""I hope this isn't another physical challenge,"" Cameron said. ""I'd prefer something a little more...academic.""

""Of course you would,"" Axel said, looking forward. ""You’re clearly the brainy one of the bunch.""

“To be fair, my greatest strengths are mental,” Cameron pointed out.

“And mine are physical,” Axel snarked. “That’s what I’m gonna use to win and make sure that you lose.”

Cameron narrowed his eyes in annoyance at the survivalist.

Beardo and Emma were now shown walking together. ""Any idea on what the challenge will be like?"" the preppy girl asked the beatboxer, who didn't talk back to her and instead darted his eyes around. ""You don’t talk much, do you?""

Confessional: Beardo

Beardo simply shrugged in the confessional.

Confessional Ends

The static cut away to the body of water that was, presumably, the Bay of Dismay. Three structures rose out of its waters: on the left and right were two-tiered game-show-like seats that housed the Toxic Rats and Mutant Maggots respectively and bore their logos on the front; and in the middle was a single Greek pedestal upon which Chris stood in his blue tuxedo below a large video screen and electronic scoreboard.

""Welcome to the 'Getting to Know You' Trivia Game Challenge,"" Chris introduced after a short fanfare. ""Everyone strapped in all nice and snug?"" he asked the contestants.

""We are snug,"" Alejandro answered, squirming in his harness. ""I can barely move in this thing!""

""Yeah, that's what you get with children's size harnesses,"" Chris chuckled. ""I'll be asking our players embarrassing personal questions,"" he explained, ""and I mean majorly humiliating. If the player I'm talking about hits the poorly-wired buzzer and owns their humiliation before the time runs out,"" he continued as the shot cut back to Alejandro looking at the red buzzer on the counter in front of him, the camera zooming out to show Noah and Dawn on the right, and Beardo, Dakota, and Tyler on the back row, ""their team gets a point."" The camera panned across the Maggots, showing Emma, Axel, and Shawn in the top row and Cameron, Mike, and Lindsay below. ""First team to five wins part one, and a distinct advantage in part two.""

""Buuut,"" Chris added as the shot cut back to him as the tension rose in the background music, ""if no one owns up, this happens!"" He took out his remote, pressed the button, and with a mechanical whir the elevated stand the Maggots were seated in suddenly dropped into the bay. The music became tense as the shot cut to the six holding their breaths below the water, focusing in on Cameron in particular. He looked around and screamed when he saw the large mutant shark with arms and legs looking at him hungrily, and his teammates joined in as the shark reared back to take a bite – but the stand rose back up just in time to take the teens away from danger.

The shot cut back to the surface as the Maggots re-emerged, dripping and coughing and generally frantic. ""There's some kind of two-legged shark monster down there!"" Mike told the host in a panic.

""You mean Fang?"" Chris asked with a broad smile and quick laugh. ""Yeah, it turns out toxic waste can mess with stuff underwater too."" He pointed up at the screen above him as he spoke, and the camera panned up to show a seemingly ordinary shark drinking a cup of tea on a wooden post underwater...until the music peaked, the screen flashed, and a picture of Fang against a simple teal background replaced the normal shark. ""Who knew?""

""Better them than us,"" Noah snarked from the Rats' stand.

""Anywho,"" Chris continued slowly, ""when a team gets dunked, their opponents can steal by guessing which dunk-ee is guilty. Guess right, and you get a point. Guess wrong, and this happens."" With a sly look, he pressed the button on his remote again, and this time it was the Rats who got plunged into the bay. Fang was shown tying a bib around his neck, then looking behind him just as the fresh set of teenagers came into view. He turned around and opened his mouth to bite, and with the muffled screams and tense music playing the shot cut back to the bubbling surface. Chris put his hand to his ear, then pressed the button once more, and the Toxic Rats rocketed back up on their stand.

""Now that we understand the rules,"" Chris told them as they coughed up water, ""let's start the game!"" A short gameshow jingle played, and the host pulled a notecard out from behind his back. ""To the Rats, now listen carefully,"" he began. ""Who gets frightened,"" the shot moved to a picture of a chicken that was now displayed on the screen above him, ""when they're around this?""

All six members of the Mutant Maggots began to laugh, as did five members of the Toxic Rats – all except Tyler, who blushed as the camera zoomed in on him. ""How did you even get that?"" the klutz said in his embarrassment, pressing his buzzer and yelping at the shock he received.

Another jingle played as the shot cut to the scoreboard, the Rats' half changing from 0 to 1.

""Next question,"" Chris said as the camera moved back to him and his card, now turned towards the Maggots. ""Who wore one of these until they were eleven?"" The screen now showed a picture of a diaper.

Like before, all but one person laughed.

""Whoever it is better own up,"" Axel said as the camera focused on the Maggots after the laughter died down.

As the timer continued ticking, the shot finally focused on Cameron, who was sweating nervously. He finally slammed his right hand down on his buzzer. ""My mom didn't want to risk me falling into a dirty toilet,"" he said after getting shocked.

The scoreboard updated to show the Maggots' first point. ""And it's one-all!"" the host declared, earning a cheer from the other five Maggots.

""Thanks Cameron,"" Emma whispered to the boy shrinking in his seat. ""I know that must've been hard to admit.""

""Rats,"" Chris turned back to the other team, ""whose first name is really Bartholomew?”

""That's not embarrassing,"" Shawn called out. ""So what if a guy's name is really Bartholomew?""

Over to the Rats, Tyler was whistling a tune, Noah was shrugging to signify it wasn't him, and Alejandro was just waiting for someone to buzz in.

Beardo, on the other hand, looked down at his own buzzed timidly, and after some consideration, he pressed the buzzer and got shocked, raising his hand to let Chris know that he owned up to the question.

""Correct, Bartholomew,"" Chris teased the human soundboard. ""Rats get the point, but I would've preferred a verbal response.""

""But Beardo's a silent person,"" Dawn spoke in his defense. ""Just look at his aura.""

Beardo nodded in agreement.

""Don't care,"" Chris said apathetically. ""So, as a quick punishment."" He smiled as he pushed the button on his remote again.

The Rats were plunged back into the water, and the camera focused on Noah as he hollered before getting chomped up by Fang, the stand rising back up as Fang struggled to close his jaws.

Noah managed to get out of Fang's mouth, shouting ""Wait for me!"" as he swam back to his seat.

Confessional: Noah

""A near-death by a shark attack. Ain't that something new,"" Noah told the confessional, pulling something white out of his butt. ""And I managed to get a shark tooth for myself,"" he said, looking at the tooth.

Confessional: Fang

The next to use the confessional was none other than Fang, examining his mouth in a hand mirror with great concern. Upon noticing the gap in his upper row of sharp teeth, he growled angrily and snapped the mirror.

Confessionals End

Noah furiously climbed back into his seat. ""I've experienced enough danger for today!"" Noah huffed. ""I'm done with this challenge!""

""Good point,"" Lindsay chimed in, the shot cutting to her and the other Maggots. ""Can I leave please? I don't want to be a shark's meal. I'm way too tasty.""

""If they get to get out of this, I want out too,"" Shawn said. ""I'm not a fan of having my info exposed.""

""Since I've already been humiliated,"" Tyler piped up, looking at the host, ""I think I can go.""

""Okay, everyone just settle down,"" Chris told them all sternly.

""I'm with everyone else. We should stop,"" Mike said, standing up and trying to undo his harness. ""Not that I've got any secrets to hide.""

""You can do so after you've had a secret revealed,"" Axel snapped.

""Hey! Host talking here!"" Chris barked. ""I decide when the challenge is over.""

""Like I care,"" Noah scoffed, having already removed his harness. ""I'm out of here.""

""You could still help us figure out the questions, amigo,"" Alejandro suggested.

Dakota used the opportunity to take out a backup phone. “Hey, it's me.”

Just then, Fang jumped out of the water and took a large bite out of the Maggots' stand, forcing them to yelp.

“Yeah, I'm using my backup phone,” Dakota told the person on the other end.

The shot cut back to the Maggots as Emma, Axel, and Shawn began to argue with each other, Cameron shrunk back into his seat, and Mike and Lindsay watched the debacle going on.

Eventually, the shot cut back to Chris as he finally shouted ""Alright! SHUT IT!"" The off-screen arguments promptly ceased. ""Thanks to that pathetic digression,"" he said in annoyance, glancing at his watch, ""now we don't have enough time to finish this challenge! Happy?""

The Rats voiced their agreement. Likewise, all the Maggots agreed happily.

""Well you won't be happy for long,"" Chris told them and the camera with a smile. ""Come back after the break for an all-new challenge from which there is no escape. And in the meantime,"" he added slyly as he took his remote back out and pushed the button, causing both teams to be dunked into the bay with a scream once more.

(Commercial Break)

The scene faded back in to a shot of some treetops, Cameron saying ""Thankfully the challenge ended before Chris could ask me any more embarrassing questions,"" as the camera panned down to the Maggots walking through the woods.

""You were the only one out of all of us to get a question,"" Axel said, the two walking at the front of their team's pack. ""The rest of us didn't because we wanted to be quitters and lose the challenge.""

""I mean, we probably weren't gonna win anyway,” Shawn doubted. “And getting an advantage in the next challenge probably wouldn't be worth it.""

“And I have just enough right to be here as you do,” Cameron told Axel. “I'll prove it in the next challenge.”

“Hmm. We'll see,” Axel said dismissively.

Confessional: Cameron

Cameron was sucking his thumb while curled up in a ball. “Why did I say that? Why?” he lamented and continued to suck on his thumb.

Confessional Ends

The scene cut back to the Rats, also walking through the woods together, and focused on Tyler and Dakota at the end of their pack.

""So now that you know my fear of chickens,"" Tyler said, ""I guess you think I'm lame.""

""Of course not, but Chris is such a jerk,"" Dakota told him, pulling out her phone that had been soaked and broken. ""I could've sent like, six-hundred texts by now.""

“About that, why do you keep using your phones so much?” Tyler wondered. “You know Chris would just take them away.”

“I have friends and followers back home, and I don't want them to think that I've forgotten all about them while on my pursuit for fame,” Dakota explained.

“I can get behind that, but how about you push your electronics aside and just focus on the challenge today?” Tyler suggested.

“I can't exactly promise that, but I'll try to,” Dakota said as they smiled at each other.

The shot cut ahead to Noah and Alejandro, who looked like they'd been listening. “Chris sure did a number on us if he took away Dakota's phone,"" Noah said.

“True, but Dakota might recover as we heard earlier,” Alejandro replied.

“I heavily doubt it,” Noah shook his head. “The girl is electronically dependent, and that could hinder us.”

“Let's give the lady a chance to prove herself to us,” Alejandro advised. “If we lose, we'll simply vote her off.”

“Works for me,” Noah agreed.

Confessional: Alejandro

""I could have used Dakota as a pawn in my game, but she's too obsessed with her phones to even pay attention to me,"" Alejandro explained. ""Dawn's not one to get invested in love, but I see more use in her.""

Confessional Ends

""Welcome, players!"" Chris announced over the loudspeaker again, the camera cutting down to ground level to show the Rats meeting up with the Maggots again. ""Now that you're all here, it's time for part two of today's challenge,"" the host continued, the shot zooming out to show all twelve campers standing in some sort of wide field of mud with a wooden ramp leading up off-camera on the right.

""The 'Mad Skills Obstacle Course',"" Chris announced, the shot cutting to him standing on some patch of grass.

""The relay race begins with a mad dash from the Kick Start,"" the shot cut to the wooden platform at the other end of the ramp, where an absurdly large rubber root was connected by wooden shaft and gear to a pole sticking up out of the platform. ""Forget coffee,"" the host said as the boot swung squeakily back and forth in demonstration, ""if this baby doesn't get you goin', nothin' will.""

""Then it's off to the race against time that is the Cannonball Run,"" Chris said, the camera following his motion further onward to another stretch of wooden platform. Several cannons situated below suddenly blew gaping holes in it, and the shot zoomed out to show several more cannons hooked up to a scaffold over the platform and aimed downward.

""Over to my personal fave,"" the shot moved to the end of the platform where a log had been set up to rotate on its side, ""Wrecking Ball Alley! Hurts so good,"" he said as the camera panned across and the titular wrecking ball swung down over the rolling log.

""And moving on,"" the shot cut next to a few higher, disconnected, and generally precarious platforms, ""we head to the Gang Plank, complete with rabid mutant beavers."" The shot cut to the mud pit at the bottom where two giant wooly beavers with boney spikes along their back were busily chewing through the poles the gang plank platforms were on.

""Followed by,"" the shot cut to a close-up of a large, red, butt-shaped apparatus that was moving up and down, ""the bouncy agony of Double Trouble."" The shot zoomed out to show four of the butt-shaped things moving up and down between two platforms.

""And finally,"" Chris said, ""the Grand Slam,"" the shot cut to several giant baseball bats sticking up out of the mud surrounding an equally giant baseball mitt, ""where you'll use ropes to swing into the giant baseball mitt, while avoiding those deadly bats."" The shot zoomed in on the mitt, then panned over to one of the bats as a small red bird flew head-first into it, knocking it out with a clonk. ""Piece of cake,"" Chris said with a chuckle as the shot cut back to the staring and nervous campers.

""Oh, and as you may remember,"" the host added, ""I said that the winning team from part one would have a distinct advantage in part two?”

""But there was no winner!"" Lindsay said.

""Yeah, don't remind me,"" Chris answered in annoyance. ""The losing team was gonna wear snazzy specs while competing,"" he explained with a chipper smile, ""but since we never actually finished the competition,"" he became annoyed again, ""I've decided that everybody has to wear them!"" He laughed, and the campers looked behind them to see Chef Hatchet holding a cardboard box.

Dawn was the first to step forward, taking out one of the pairs of glasses – thick, ugly things that almost seemed to have a greenish tint to them – and put them on. Her brow shot up immediately. ""These glasses appear to be rather old,"" she said. ""We won't be able to see anything wearing these!"" The perspective shifted to demonstrate what she was seeing, which was little more than an incredibly blurry shot of the forest and some unknown body of water.

""Dorktacular goggles won't make part two easy,"" Chris said, ""or attractive,"" he shrugged, ""but it can be done. In theory.""

The campers groaned.

""Competitors, take your positions!"" he said, and the footage flashed forward to show Alejandro and Lindsay together near the edge of the first platform, Lindsay looking at her new glasses unhappily. ""First up at the Kick Start, it's Alejandro against Lindsay,"" the host said before the shot moved on to the next pair. ""Then, it's Dawn versus Shawn,"" the two looked about before the shot pulled back to show the cannons, ""versus the Cannonballs.""

""Noah faces Axel in Wrecking Ball Alley,"" the two stared at each other with frowns, the latter more competitively. ""Beardo is up against Emma in the Gang Plank,"" the camera cut to the base of the ladder then panned all the way up to it to the two nervous teens on top, ""Tyler and Mike will battle Double Trouble,"" the two looked warily at the butt-shaped apparatus in front of them, ""and, Dakota will fight Cameron for the Grand Slam."" The young woman was shown moving her arms around, the shot moving out to show the baseball mitt.

""First team to finish wins the whoooole shebang,"" Chris explained. ""And, the other team loses a member tonight! Since it's a relay race,"" he added, ""you'll need something to pass: your mascots,"" he said with a grin. ""Oh, intern~!""

A scrawny white boy with his long black hair flipped over his eyes walked up to Alejandro and Lindsay holding a pair of pet carriers; whatever was inside was snarling angrily enough for the two competitors to exchange a wary look. ""Team Rat gets a mutant rat,"" Chris announced as the intern thrust a large, squealing, six-legged hairless rat into Alejandro's arms. ""And Team Maggot gets,"" the host continued, ""a mutant maggot.""

A dramatic tune played as a large, slimy green maggot was thrust into Lindsay's arms. ""Eww, I don't like maggots,"" she said in disgust.

""Aaaand,"" Chris said as he prepared an airhorn, ""go!""

At the sound of the horn and the start of the series' typical tense challenge music, the giant boot swung down on the two campers. Alejandro managed to duck out of the way, but Lindsay was not so lucky and got sent flying with a scream. She landed in the mud between platforms, but kept the maggot held high. It burped as Chris said ""And Lindsay gets the boot!""

Alejandro hopped across the gap between platforms with the rat in his arms.

""Alejandro takes the early lead,"" Chris continued, and the latino ran up to Dawn.

“Here you go,” Alejandro offered the rat.

""Congratulations Alejandro,"" Dawn said as she took the rat from him, then turned and ran off down the course.

The shot cut to Dawn as she ran along her part of the platform. ""Okay,"" she told the rat as it jittered at her, ""you want me to move to the right?""

She moved the requested steps and avoided slamming face-first into a post. ""Thank you.” The rat jittered again. “And now I should stop?” She only got another two steps before a sudden cannon volley through the floor in front of her forced her to a stop.

""Oh no,"" Lindsay groaned to herself, now covered in mud as she ran along the first part of the platform with her maggot held out in front of her. She jumped the gap, and soon reached Shawn. ""We're not too far behind, are we?"" the blonde asked as she held out their team's mascot in what wasn't quite the right direction.

""Nothing I can't handle, so just give it to me,"" Shawn grabbed the maggot and dashed off.

""That was pretty easy,"" Lindsay said as she walked back the opposite way...and blindly fell into the gap between platforms, landing with a squelch of mud.

""The Maggots take the lead!"" Chris called out as Shawn caught up to Dawn at the start of the cannonball run. Another cannon fired towards them, forcing both to dart and duck out of the way.

""Okay,"" Shawn said with a hint of nervousness, ""this is easy! Just gotta dodge a bunch of cannons I can barely see, that's all!"" He gulped and charged forward, leaving Dawn to chase after him.

The scene moved to Noah and Axel waiting at the start of the next leg, listening to the sound of cannonfire behind them.

Finally, Shawn ran up and thrust the maggot into Axel's arms. ""Move, Axel!"" Shawn commanded.

""You don't have to tell me twice!"" Axel ran off. The challenge music rose up again as she sidled along the rolling log, just in time to see the wrecking ball swinging towards her. She steeled herself and jumped up, safely grabbing on to the ball and allowing it to carry her forward. She jumped off at the extent of its swing, and sailed further on through the air all the way to Beardo and Emma.

An out-of-breath Dawn ran up to Noah and handed over their rat. Noah took it and turned and ran towards the rolling logs.

""Here you go,"" Axel said as the shot cut back to her passing the maggot to Emma. ""And don’t screw up!""

""Like I was going to,"" Emma rolled her eyes before jumping on to the first precariously isolated platform. It immediately started to wobble and sink, and Emma cried out in alarm as the camera quick-panned to the base revealing the two mutant beavers making quick work of the pole. The focus moved back to the top as Emma tried to jump to the next platform, only for the one she was standing on to wobble in just the right way to cause her to fall down into the mud. ""Oh no...,"" she said as she recovered and saw the two ferocious-looking beavers she had landed between.

""And Emma takes a dive!"" Chris announced as the shot moved back to Noah crossing the rolling logs. ""Will the Rats be able to retake the lead?""

""I sure hope so,"" Noah told himself, only to miss the wrecking ball swinging down at him. It caught him in the slide and sent him flying with a scream, all the way to a shocked and startled Beardo.

The shot briefly cut away to Chris and Chef sitting in green armchairs watching the challenge feed on a wide screen television set up nearby; they laughed uproariously as they watched Noah get hit and land.

The shot cut back to Emma, who was now being held by one beaver while the other hungrily took out a bottle of ketchup. ""Please, let me go!"" the blonde girl struggled, the maggot held close to her body. The second beaver opened the bottle of ketchup and licked its lips, causing Emma to gasp...then scowl. ""I said, let me go!"" she said forcefully, kicking first the ketchup-holding beaver and then the her-holding beaver between their legs, causing each to squeal in pain and fall over onto their backs holding their groins.

""Sorry,"" Emma told them with genuine concern, ""but I repeatedly told you to stop, so it’s not my fault.""

She turned and ran off through the mud without another word, and Chris announced ""And the Maggots are in it again!""

""Get going, Bigfoot!"" Noah told Beardo as he handed the rat over to him.

Beardo nodded and turned forward, hopping to the first platform. It immediately wobbled, but he was able to hop to the next one before he fell – and this one seemed more stable.

The camera quick-panned down to the beavers as they got back on their feet and growled, then forward under the course to Emma, who had just started climbing up the supports of the next section of platform. ""Oh no,"" she said as she tried to look back. ""Please tell me they’re not going to eat me again.""

The shot cut to the top where Tyler and Mike were awaiting, and Beardo had finally gotten to the platform, sounding off a dinging sound to alert Tyler about his arrival.

""Thanks Beardo,"" Tyler said, grabbing the mutant rat from him. ""Now it’s Tyler time!"" He turned and dashed down the course, just as Emma finally climbed up to the top of the platform with her team's maggot.

""And Tyler finally gets the Rats' lead back!"" Chris announced as the camera followed the jock up to the Double Trouble apparatus.

""Extreme!!"" Tyler cheered as he threw himself on to the first butt-shaped thing, landed on his face, and bounced off it with a cry of pain. He continued on in this way, painfully bouncing from one to the next until eventually he reached the end. ""Dakota, take it!"" he yelled to his teammate, the fame monger waiting with her back turned at the edge of the next platform, apparently looking at her own reflection in her mirror.

Despite stretching his rat-holding arms out towards her as he fell, Tyler was unable to make the pass-off in time before falling completely past her and landing in the mud. ""Okay, ready!"" Dakota said as she finally turned around.

The shot cut to Tyler face down in the mud, and the mutant rat scampered out of his grasp. “No! Come back!” he scrambled to his feet and chased after it.

""Mike, go already!"" Emma told her teammate as the shot cut back to her holding the muddy and slimy maggot out to him.

Mike reached out for the mutated larva. “Got it!” he said, only for the larva to promptly vomit onto his face.

""Okay, I'm going,"" he said in disgust, turning and running off down the course. “Okay, Mike. It's just some jumps over an area you can barely see! You can do this, c'mon.” The perspective briefly changed to show the blurry obstacle that Mike was approaching, then changed back to his head-on close-up as he inhaled.

""Wrong! Only vone person can do dis!” he declared in a fairly good Russian accent, his voice taking on a feminine aspect to accompany what almost looked like fuller lips and longer eyelashes as he began tiptoeing forward. “Svetlana, ze Olympic queen of gymnastics!"" Svetlana then jumped onto the second butt-shaped object and handsprung onto the fourth. She flipped onto the platform in-between Dakota and Cameron with a vocalized cheer.

""Whoa!"" Chris announced, the camera cutting to him and Chef on their chairs. ""Mike unveils a secret skill and the Maggots retake the lead!""

Svetlana inhaled and returned to Mike. “Svetlana?” Cameron said in confusion. “Mike, how did you do that?”

“Huh? Uh, do what?” Mike chuckled nervously. “Uh, here you go.” Cameron took the maggot with a suspicious glance at the theater boy.

The camera panned back to the left, reaching Dakota just as Tyler forced their team's mascot into her arms. ""Here!"" he commanded.

""Eww! Can you at least wipe it off?"" Dakota complained in disgust.

Cameron was shown running forward. “Yes! Yes! I've never felt so alive!” he said in excitement until he froze at how far the mitt was. “I'm a dead man.”",1,1735932953.0,u_xtremexavier15,0,1.0,False

Welcome to your comprehensive guide on the Rancilio Silvia espresso machine.  This guide is designed for home espresso enthusiasts, whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting your espresso journey. We’ll cover everything from setup and brewing techniques to troubleshooting and maintenance, helping you unlock the potential of this popular machine and consistently brew café-quality espresso at home.


## Overview of the Rancilio Silvia: A Home Barista's Dream?

The Rancilio Silvia consistently ranks among the top choices for home espresso machines. Its enduring popularity stems from a blend of robust build quality, reliable performance, and a relatively accessible price point, making it a strong contender against similarly priced machines like the Gaggia Classic and Sage Bambino Plus.  Let's delve into what makes it stand out:

**Build and Design:** The Silvia boasts a durable, mostly stainless steel construction, giving it a professional feel that belies its home-use designation.  The brass boiler is a key component, contributing to its excellent heat retention and consistent temperature during brewing. This is a significant advantage over machines with aluminum boilers.

**Key Features:**

* **Brass Boiler (12-ounce capacity):**  Provides superior heat stability compared to aluminum boilers, leading to more consistent espresso extraction.
* **Large Water Reservoir (67 ounces):** Minimizes the need for frequent refills, ideal for making multiple drinks.
* **Built-in Steam Wand:**  Allows for milk frothing, enabling you to create a range of espresso-based drinks like cappuccinos and lattes.
* **Warming Tray:**  Keeps your espresso cups warm before brewing, enhancing the overall coffee-drinking experience.

**Specifications:**  While exact dimensions might vary slightly depending on the model year, you can typically expect a machine that's compact enough for most kitchen countertops without sacrificing performance. Check Rancilio's official website for the most up-to-date specifications.


## Rancilio Silvia vs. the Competition: Gaggia Classic and Sage Bambino Plus

Choosing your first espresso machine can be overwhelming.  The Rancilio Silvia often finds itself compared to the Gaggia Classic and the Sage Bambino Plus. While all three are excellent entry-level options, their strengths differ:

* **Rancilio Silvia:**  Known for its robust brass boiler, offering superior temperature stability and longevity.  It's a workhorse that can handle frequent use.
* **Gaggia Classic:** A classic for a reason, the Gaggia Classic is also a reliable and popular choice, known for its simplicity and ease of use. It's often slightly less expensive than the Silvia.
* **Sage Bambino Plus:**  Focuses on ease of use and speed. It often features pre-programmed settings and a quicker heat-up time, ideal for beginners who want simpler operation.

The best choice depends on your priorities.  If temperature stability and long-term durability are paramount, the Rancilio Silvia is a strong contender.  If simplicity and speed are more important, the Bambino Plus might be preferable.  The Gaggia Classic offers a good balance between the two.


## Mastering the Rancilio Silvia: A Step-by-Step Guide to Perfect Espresso

This section provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to brewing espresso using the Rancilio Silvia.  Remember, consistency is key, and practice will refine your technique.

### Setting Up Your Rancilio Silvia

1. **Unboxing and Initial Inspection:** Carefully unpack your machine and inspect it for any damage.
2. **Filling the Water Reservoir:**  Fill the reservoir with fresh, filtered water.  Avoid using tap water, as mineral deposits can lead to scaling.
3. **Preheating:** Turn on the machine and allow it to heat up completely.  This typically takes 15-20 minutes.  You'll know it's ready when the pump stops cycling.

### The Art of Espresso Extraction: Ratios and Timing

The ideal espresso extraction ratio is generally 1:2. This means that for every 18 grams (adjust based on your portafilter size) of finely ground coffee, you aim for 36 grams of espresso.  An extraction time of 25-30 seconds is considered optimal.  However, this might vary depending on your coffee beans, grind size, and tamping technique.

### Step-by-Step Espresso Brewing:

1. **Grind Your Beans:** Use a burr grinder for a consistent grind size.  A coarser grind might be necessary for darker roasts, whereas lighter roasts require a finer grind.
2. **Dose and Tamp:**  Add the measured coffee grounds to your portafilter basket.  Level the grounds and tamp firmly and evenly using a 30-pound tamper.  Inconsistent tamping leads to uneven extraction.
3. **Lock and Brew:** Securely lock the portafilter into the group head.  Start the brewing process and observe the extraction.  The flow should be consistent, initially slow and then gradually increasing before slowing down again.
4. **Enjoy Your Shot:**  Once the extraction is complete, assess the espresso for crema, color, and taste.  Adjust your grind size, tamp pressure, or dose as needed.


## Troubleshooting Common Rancilio Silvia Issues

Even with a high-quality machine like the Rancilio Silvia, you might encounter some challenges. Here are solutions to some common problems:

### Temperature Issues:

* **Inconsistent Espresso Temperature:**  The Silvia's single boiler design can lead to some temperature fluctuation. This is often addressed through """"temperature surfing,"""" a technique involving multiple shots to stabilize the temperature. Consider upgrading to a PID controller for more precise temperature control.
* **Low Steam Pressure:** Ensure the water reservoir is adequately filled.  Descaling is also crucial for maintaining optimal steam pressure.


### Milk Steaming Problems:

* **Insufficient Microfoam:**  Practice proper steaming techniques.  Purge the steam wand, then submerge the wand tip slightly below the surface of the milk.  Create a swirling vortex to incorporate air and create velvety microfoam.
* **Burning the Milk:**  Avoid keeping the steam wand submerged for too long.  Maintain a consistent distance and listen for a change in the sound of the steam.


##  Expanding Your Espresso Horizons: Recipes for Classic Drinks

The Rancilio Silvia opens the door to a world of espresso-based beverages. Here are recipes for some popular drinks:

* **Cappuccino:** 1 shot espresso + equal parts steamed milk + milk foam
* **Latte:** 1 shot espresso + 2 parts steamed milk + a thin layer of foam
* **Americano:** 1 shot espresso + hot water (adjust to your preference)


## Maintenance and Care: Keeping Your Rancilio Silvia in Top Shape

Regular maintenance is essential for the longevity of your Rancilio Silvia.

* **Descaling:**  Descaling your machine regularly, using a descaling solution specifically designed for espresso machines, is crucial to prevent mineral buildup and maintain optimal performance.  Follow Rancilio's recommended descaling procedure.
* **Cleaning:**  Clean the portafilter, group head, and steam wand after each use.  Wipe down the exterior of the machine regularly.


## Conclusion: Brewing Excellence at Home

The Rancilio Silvia espresso machine empowers you to create café-quality espresso in the convenience of your own home. While it requires practice and attention to detail, the rewards of consistently brewing delicious espresso are well worth the effort. Remember to experiment with different coffee beans, grind sizes, and techniques to discover your perfect espresso recipe.  Enjoy the journey!

**Letter of Saint Catherine to Mona Colomba in Lucca - Drowned in the World**

**God has not set you free from the world, for you are smothered and drowned in the world by your affections and inordinate desires. Now, have you more than one soul by our world? No. If you had two, you might give one to God and the other to the world. Nor have you more than one body, and this gets tired over every little thing.** 

This letter was written to a well to do friend of Saint Catherine's but it may apply more strongly now, in our wealthy modern world where low income persons Iive better than most wealthy persons of Saint Catherine's time. If we have just a television and internet, we're more “smothered and drowned in the world” by our “affections and inordinate desires” than the medieval woman Saint Catherine was writing to. And if we dedicate more hours and excess wealth to movies, dining out, coffee shops, etc, than we do to  Charity, Church, Prayer and Scripture, then we have given our soul not to God but to the world instead. 

**Supportive Scripture - Douay Rheims Challoner Bible**

**First John 2:15-17 Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh and the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world passeth away and the concupiscence thereof: but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.**

Saint Catherine's message is enlightening in an unpleasantly sobering way because if I add up the hours for God against the hours for the world, it ends up as a landslide for the world and a trickle for God. Saint Catherine goes deeper than that though, from our time dedicated to God to our actual works, finances and worldly goods dedicated to God for others rather than self for our own enjoyment.

**Be a dispenser to the poor of your temporal substance. Submit you to the yoke of holy and true obedience. Kill, kill your own will, that it may not be so tied to your relatives, and mortify your body, and do not so pamper it in delicate ways. Despise yourself, and have in regard neither rank nor riches, for virtue is the only thing that makes us gentlefolk, and the riches of this life are the worst of poverty when possessed with inordinate love apart from God.**

Even if we were to pass the test of dedicating more time to God than the world, it would all be feel-good vanity unless a lot of that additional  time manifested charitably into the lives of others. And I believe when Saint Catherine tells us through her letter to “be a dispenser to the poor of your temporal substance,” she's talking about pouring out our temporal substance without measure, not doling it out after making sure our 401K’s and IRA’s are taken care of. She's calling Mona Colomba into a more austere existence but if we apply that message to our own well to livestyles we’d be substituting restaurants, movies and parties during our weekends for volunteer work, financial charity and Scripture.

Going back to the beginning of this entry, Saint Catherine's point to her friend was about being “set free from the world.” She speaks of charity as a means to that end, being “a dispenser to the poor of your temporal substance.” Saint Catherine is speaking of charity not only for the sake of the poor but for the spiritual sake of her friend as well, so she’d not be “smothered and drowned in the world” by “affections and inordinate desires.” Saint Catherine's point was that through charity for the worldly poverty of others, Mona Colomba might escape the spiritual poverty she suffered herself. That lesson is more needed now than in Saint Catherine's day because the world today offers so much more to smother and drown a soul that might otherwise find God. Charity benefits the poor man in this temporal realm until the money is spent and the food eaten. But it benefits the giver eternally, freeing the soul from the smothering effects of worldly distractions so it may better see and pursue spiritual treasure in the Eternal Realm of God.

It’s been a reliable little workhorse, but over the last year, I’ve felt the urge for something... more. Initially, my sights were set on a sleek all-in-one system, like the Cambridge Audio Evo One or the Ruark R410. I wanted something compact, stylish (read: not an eyesore), and easy to manage.

But then, I stumbled across the Ruark R610 with its Sabre-Rs, and let me tell you—it was like a rabbit hole opened up and swallowed me into the world of proper hi-fi setups. Enter this subreddit, and it was game over. Suddenly, my mild curiosity became a full-blown mission to embrace the glory of a conventional stereo system.

After a whirlwind of research, indecision, and several sleepless nights (thanks, hi-fi rabbit hole), I finally took the plunge: a Naim Uniti Atom, Sonus Faber Lumina I’s, and a Ruark RS1 subwoofer now grace my setup. And wow. As much as I adored my AudioPro C10, this new rig is in a completely different league—warmer, cleaner, clearer, and yet it manages to avoid that sterile, clinical sound some setups can have. It’s like the difference between a good cup of coffee and the best espresso you’ve ever had: familiar, yet transformative.

For now, the system sits on my DIY TV stand (yes, I built it myself, thank you very much), but I’m already scouting for speaker stands that’ll pair beautifully with the Sonus Fabers. Suggestions welcome!",6,1735932791.0,audiophile,6,1.0,False

Here’s the blurb:
After the sudden death of her husband Abe, Mona Bright sees the tragedy as an opportunity for a new beginning, even at seventy-years-old. She moves to Manatola Springs, Florida—a place she has always dreamed of living, but which Abe was never fond of. The town is most famous for their Mermaid Show, which was one of Mona’s only escapes from a chaotic upbringing, once a year on her birthday.
A retired marine biologist with a deep connection to the water, Mona is determined to pursue her lifelong dream of becoming a mermaid performer. But as she steps into this world, the voice in her head tells her she’s too old for such a role in a world that favors youth and beauty.
Mona joins a mermaid class taught by Aletha, a legendary mermaid performer a few years her senior. Their relationship quickly deepens and Mona finds herself drawn into Aletha’s world, forcing her to confront buried truths about her past and her own desires.

Chapter One
March 9

Dear Abe,

It's been ninety-six days since you've gone. Can you believe it? Ninety-six long days without you by my side. Last week, I packed up our house and moved to a new one. 4852 Hushpuppy Lane in Manatola Springs. I know, I can already hear you say, “Manatola Springs is Orlando’s ugly stepsister. Why would you want to live there?” But you know it’s been a special place, calling out to me all these years. And houses on the Springs rarely come onto the market, maybe a few each year. I stumbled across this one online, and the pictures pulled me in immediately. Lemon-yellow siding, bright and welcoming, like a postcard of someone’s perfect dream. The man selling it, Jim, said he was moving back north to be with his family after his wife passed away. Something about that felt almost poetic, as well as deeply depressing, I suppose. I didn’t even see it in person before placing an offer. I know, I know, but I had to. I needed a change, and I also finally decided to pursue my dream of becoming a Manatola Springs mermaid. Anyways, the house is small and quaint, but this makes it feel far less lonely. The inside of the house is painted brightly in orange, yellow, green, and red—all colors you would’ve hated, but they make me feel alive and bring a smile to my face. The backyard, though! That’s what sold me. Sitting right on the springs, it has a pool with a view you could die for. Far superior to the view from our old house, facing the golf range, susceptible to the stares of old creepy men. Remember how they would stare right in at me? Here, the world is quiet and belongs to me. I’ve already developed a daily morning ritual. During golden hour, I sit on this creaky swing on the dock. Each time I get on, I’m terrified of it falling, but once I do, I swing and relax, sipping on a hot cup of coffee, watching the sky and surroundings shift colors like some sort of light show, taking in the arrival of each day with gratitude that I’m still here. I enjoy life’s beauty. When sunbeams hit the spring water just right, they sparkle like millions of diamonds dancing across the surface. The show was particularly beautiful today. I know how much you hated Manatola, Abe, but I wish you could see it. I wish you were here, and I’m certain you'd recognize the beauty in it. 
I’m sure you’d like to hear about daddy’s little girl. Riley has been such a help, grinning and bearing it, even though I’m sure it’s been hard for her. She helped me move and is making sure I settle in OK. She’s not thrilled that we’re now two hours apart, but I plan to visit her often and vice versa. Of course, she misses you, but she hides it much better than I do, although therapy may have a lot to do with that. She nagged me to start therapy, so I did. And thank God that I listened. I know how skeptical you’ve always been. I admit, so was I at first, but it really has been beneficial to my wellbeing. I mean, I’ve been a real wreck and a half. Admittedly, though, with your death came some freedom and a reemergence of my bad eating habits. I didn’t have to sneak around anymore. The kitchen was mine and mine alone. Right after you passed, I could hardly eat for a few days. I had no appetite and even lost three pounds, but as your loss became less surreal, my habit of excess eating returned with vengeance. I would go to the grocery store each night and get a tub of ice cream along with baked goods, like cookies, donuts, slices of pie, and then down them in one sitting. At first, I almost threw up, but after each night, I could tolerate it more until it went down with ease. I gained fifteen pounds in a month and that was the impetus for me starting therapy. Dr. Fletcher, my therapist, has been helping me keep these habits under control. 
Of course, your being gone has been a major adjustment. Mornings are usually the most difficult. It’s that moment when I wake up and realize your body is not beside mine. I’m still not used to all the emptiness. It’s more than just you being absent from the room, which is still surreal. Funnily enough, the things I miss most are things I found completely irritating before. Like your snoring, your loud footsteps throughout the house, and your voice echoing from your office when you took your copious amounts of phone calls. These reminders of your absence, these snapshots of you, they occasionally flash in my mind and the tears begin to run. I find myself trying to remember little details about our life together, things only you would know. You were the sole witness to so many moments, my go-to when memory failed me. But I can’t ask you anymore. With each day, my memory of you fades and I fear forgetting what you were like. Of course, I could never forget you, but the viscerality and vividness of you is fading. It scares me that one day you may become shadows of a memory. I don’t want you to think I’m trying to forget about you by moving, because I never could, but I hope it will allow me to better grieve and sooner come to peace with your loss. 
Speaking of moving, the most difficult part was figuring out what to do with all your things. You certainly didn’t make it easy. I mean, you had a shit ton of stuff! More things than even you probably thought. Packing really was terrible. Throwing things out felt cruel and like I’d washed your existence away, but I had to, otherwise it would’ve been impossible. I decided to pack one large box for you and kept some of your favorite clothes and items. Don’t worry, I made sure to keep your favorite flannel shirt. The one with the small holes that you wore to death. That box is safe in the attic. Sometimes, when I really miss you, I’ll go through the box to catch a trace of you again. And every time, upon opening it, your smell escapes, wafting into the air. I also let Riley take whatever she wanted, and we donated the rest to Habitat for Humanity, so at least they will go to new homes, and pieces of you will be scattered throughout Florida, and maybe the world, creating new stories and memories. I like the idea of that, and hopefully you do too. I also bought mostly new furniture to start fresh. Well, new-used furniture, mostly from Habitat and other antique shops. Since I’m alone, I’m able to decorate however I want, and I don’t have to put up with your nagging about my kitschy taste. 
But anyways, I wanted to explain my reason for all of this, for writing to you, I mean. Dr. Fletcher recommended I write to you. A grief journal, as she calls it. I know it’s silly. I’m essentially writing to myself, unless you are currently haunting me, like you had always hoped. But even in these few sentences, I already feel more connected to you again. I think we left a lot unsaid. So, now I can say everything that’s been on my chest, but don’t be too scared. I’ll try my best to be kind to your memory. To the memory of us. 
Maybe that’s why I moved. So that I can make new memories that aren’t stained by your absence. Maybe this new setting will better allow me to move on. And our home felt big and empty without you. I also want to give this mermaid dream of mine a shot. I know, you always thought it was immature and strange, but I’m bored without work. I refuse to spend my days moping around the house, thinking about the life we should still have. I hope mermaiding will keep me busy and distract me from the sadness. A bit of fantasy might do me good. Really, I just need to move on, look forward to the future, and begin living in the present, like we often did together, rather than living in the past. Dr. Fletcher always tells me that “the future is friendly.” I find myself coming back to that quote often. 
I’m taking Riley to the mermaid show tomorrow. She’s supportive, or at least she is to my face. I have my first mermaid class on Friday morning with legendary Manatola Springs mermaid performer Aletha Ambrosia. Well, local legend at least. I’m sure I’ve talked to you about her before. I’m excited just for the chance to be in the same room with her.
Oh, and Rocky really misses you. I know you would never believe me, because you always thought she was just some dumb bird. A rat with wings. But the day after you’d gone, she ran around the house looking for you. She misses laying in your lap the most. Well, it’s getting late, so I should put my pen down and get some sleep. Good night! 

Love,
Mona


 












Chapter Two
March 10

Dear Abe,

Today I planned a little date for Riley’s penultimate day with me. I dragged her along to The Manatola Springs Underwater Theater & Museum. It’s the first time I’ve gone not on my birthday, and the first time seeing the show twice in one year. Before we left for the show, I showed Riley my Manatola Springs brochures, proudly displayed on my bureau. Now I don’t have to hide them in a drawer any longer. I showed her the 1964 brochure—the first time I saw Aletha. As I flipped through, Riley asked why some mermaid’s pictures were circled in red pen. I told her those were the mermaids I saw perform that year. I know she had no genuine interest, but at least she pretended to care. I drew particular attention to Aletha’s picture, circled but with lines around the perimeter, like a sun’s halo. I asked if she remembered her. She didn’t, of course. Why would she? To her, the mermaid shows were just something she sat through because I loved them so much. Even when she was a little girl, I admit it was never for her. Having a child with me was a good excuse, but really, it was always for me. Well, she did love the show for the first few years, but then it became about me. I still remember when Riley was fourteen. We entered the auditorium, and she voiced her embarrassment at seeing the show. The audience was filled with mostly much younger children than her. She felt like she was getting too old for it. I remember her calling the show “corny.” She thought it was odd that an adult would go there to celebrate her birthday. It hurt, of course. Her words I could get past, because she didn’t understand the sentimentality of this place, but it began to feel like I was forcing her to watch the show. It was one of the first signs that Riley was outgrowing childhood, along the lines of not believing in Santa anymore. A sadness came along with the idea that she was growing up and that she would soon want nothing to do with me. Perhaps, I admit, that was one reason I steeped myself more heavily in work. 
She would soon no longer need me, and I wanted to prepare myself early on for that heartbreak. Or maybe I’m making up a bullshit excuse for not being a better mother. There was always that struggle between work-life balance and her, and sometimes it became difficult to determine which one I loved more. I mean, my work, my passion, came far before Riley ever did, but there is the expectation that the child should always take precedence. Putting myself down doesn’t do any good. “We can kill time, but we can’t reverse it,” as my grandma always said. Those years of distance have been lost and there’s no use harping on about them. And Riley had a great childhood, with both parents around. I would give anything for the childhood she had. Even though I loved the life I had with Grandma. I mean, Riley doesn’t even know the full story of why her great grandma raised me. Part of me didn’t want to feel worthless and disposable in front of my own daughter. In turn, I didn’t want her to feel like I would ever abandon her in such a way. 
Anyways, I told her that Aletha’s the one I’m going to take lessons with. I’ve been thinking about it for a while now, but saying it aloud made it feel real. I was nervous about what Riley would say. I know she thinks I’m chasing something ridiculous, meant for kids, but she surprised me. She smiled and said she was proud of me. Proud! Can you imagine? She said it was inspiring, like I was starting a whole new chapter of my life, chasing a dream I’d kept buried for too long. Maybe it is a new chapter, I don’t know, but hearing her say that made me feel like I’m not completely insane.
I still remember the first time I saw her perform. It was my twelfth birthday, and they had this screen of bubbles in the tank. When the bubbles cleared, there she was, swimming out from behind a rock like she’d been waiting there all along. I remember thinking she couldn’t be real, that no human could move like that underwater. But she was, and that made it even more magical. Another mermaid joined her, and they started their synchronized routine, but I couldn’t take my eyes off Aletha. She had something special. There was a star quality about her, even back then, something that stood her out from the rest. Maybe it was also her red hair, a trait that we shared, but so few other people did. I like to think I have a good eye for talent, and Aletha was the best. She still is. She’s become one of the public faces of Manatola Springs now. Her picture is in all the brochures, and she’s a teacher at the Mermaid School. 
We made our way into the theater, and it was always like stepping back into my childhood. Nothing had changed. That place is frozen in time. The same glass panes set between those ornamental columns, with that backdrop of rocks, coral, tree limbs, and those Grecian statues. They’ve been there for as long as I can remember, but every time I see them, they still take my breath away. It’s like stepping into a fairytale, one of those worlds where you can pretend, even just for an hour, that magic is real.
I was squirming in my seat, excited for the show to begin. I was also anticipating whether Aletha would be performing. Then the music began to play. The mystery would soon be revealed. The blue curtains rose and there she was! Her red hair flowing in the water, backed by the exact same coral, rock sculpture wall, tree limbs, and scattered Grecian statues.
The show hasn’t changed either. Five mermaids, doing their synchronized swimming to that same old original score they’ve been using forever. It always reminded me of those old Hollywood Busby Berkeley movies, with over-the-top choreography numbers where everything was about perfect timing and symmetry. There’s something comforting about the way it never alters, no matter how much the world outside does. It's like watching The Wizard of Oz for the hundredth time. Timeless. I’m sure they’ve thought about changing things, but why would they? It would be criminal to mess with something so perfect.
After the show, we exited into the “museum,” which consists mostly of wax figures of historical mermaids and sirens. It’s only a small room though, and I feel it’s a crime to call it a museum. The room leads into a gift shop, which sells all kinds of mermaid merch, some specifically related to the show, although most items were generic, crappy mermaid souvenirs. We didn’t buy anything. That’s where I used to buy the souvenir brochure, but since they stopped selling them in 2002, I have seen nothing worth buying. I remember almost having a breakdown in the store when the lady behind the counter told me the devastating news. My soul was crushed. Anyways, after leaving the show building, Riley and I went to that restaurant they opened in 2009. The Grotto. Built right on the springs, with the glass floors so you can see the fish swimming below. The food was mediocre, like always, but the atmosphere made up for it. It’s like Rainforest Café, but with more water and less noise. 
I must admit, it hurts that you never came to the show with me. I know you thought it was silly. You always said you were always too busy, even when you weren't. But part of me is glad you never came. You probably wouldn’t have liked the show anyways, and I couldn’t stand to hear you make fun of it, and that we’d celebrate my birthday when we came back home, although you always managed to ease the sting with your surprise dinner and birthday decorations. You always came through in the end, pretty much easing the sting of not ever coming to the shows. 
As I lay in my bed writing this, I can hear Riley in the guest room, packing her bags to leave tomorrow. After she leaves, that’s it, I’ll be all alone here. Well, I still have Rocky, but the aloneness feels more finite than ever. Riley won’t be a five minute drive away anymore. I can’t just pop over to see her when I feel lonely. But that’s the sacrifice I chose to make, I suppose. I keep telling myself I’ll be fine. That the pros will outweigh the cons and all of this will have been worth it. But I’m starting to doubt if I’ve made a mistake in moving. Is this dream stupid and frivolous? Or will it be the start of a new life and a new me? I have to believe this to be true. I have to believe the future is friendly. The future is always friendly.

Love,
Mona

I (20F) am generally a tidy person. I have a few clothes around my room, but no food or clutter, and I always know where everything is. My boyfriend (21M) spent the night at my place since it’s closer to his work, and this morning, while I was out with friends for coffee, he decided to clean my space.

The problem is that he threw away a box of cards I’ve kept since I was 8. These cards are really sentimental to me, they’re from different people and events in my life, including cards from my great-grandparents who have passed away, funny cards from friends, and more. I love looking through them when I’m feeling down or missing those people. He didn’t ask me before tossing them out. I got home to find my box was gone, and when I asked him about it, he said, ""I thought it was just garbage, so I threw it away for you."" Once he realized what he had done, he was immediately apologetic and even ran out to check if the garbage had already been picked up.

I know he didn’t mean any harm and thought it was just junk or a hoarding issue, but I’m really hurt that he didn’t ask me first. I’m upset, but I also know he wouldn’t have done it if he understood how important those cards were to me.

I’m not sure how to move forward with this. I don’t want to break up with him, but I don’t know how to handle this situation long-term. Any advice on how to navigate this would be greatly appreciated.",1,1735932392.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

She didn’t mention her partner when we met during the day. We clicked instantly, spoke for hours and she only revealed she had a partner when I asked for her number whilst leaving after she gave me a lift back to mine…

Things started out as a friend, but we ended up talking weekly, to daily with her initiating most of the conversation and reaching for it. Things escalated to the point where she was texting daily with love hearts, arranging one on one meet ups within a group environment so it wasn’t obvious. Looking to ways to spend more time with me. I didn’t lean in because she has a partner…We ended up falling for each other and things got very heated as she arrange a group activity, but when I arrived it was only her there…We spent the day together laughing, in awe of each other and flirting through-out the day. I asked her out as there was no way she had a partner how she behaved during the day etc and she replied ‘maybe one day’ and then apologised and said she has a partner.

That was 2 months ago? Today, it’s calmed down as I asked for more distance when I was rejected. but she continues to reach out through my social media posts, either using them to start conversations privately.  If I make it clear I’m going to a group event, she will message me the night before offering to pick me up or ask if I’m attending group events and tell me when she is going. She told me the other night she’s heading out if I fancied meeting up. Knowing I had plans and couldn’t make it. I obviously said no as I wasn’t going to throw my evening away because someone wants to carrot dangle.  

Since calling her out and being rejected. I never initiate conversations, I don’t jump at every opportunity to meet or spend time with her, if we cross paths fine. I don’t interact with any social media posts. I am very much just a friend who had feelings at one point and is doing his best to make sense of this situation. I’m there for her, but she’s uptight and I have a feeling she’s either going through a breakup or they’ve broken up. She has never mention it or his name or anything about him at all….

When I attempt to turn the tables and show interest such as. Offering to pick her up as a friendly favour, she thanks for the offer. The group got coffee, she was supposed to turn up, she didn’t. I reached out and asked if she’s ok and come down I’ll get it. She couldn’t make it but is going out then coffee later…It’s always on her terms?

What is going on, where do I stand and what do I do? It’s definitely friend zoned, but with the constant interest and fact she has a partner, but wants my attention…I can’t make sense of it.",0,1735932161.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

I’m doing this for personal reasons. I wouldn’t say I’m deeply passionate about the field but I do find it fascinating. I guess passion could grow from there, right?

We're super excited to share our latest single, ""Les Murmures du Louvre,"" with you all, now available on Apple Music and your favorite streaming platforms!

🌌 **The Essence of the Song:** 
This rock single is a dreamlike journey through the silent halls of an abandoned Louvre, where the echoes of artists past whisper from long-forgotten paintings. Imagine walking amidst these masterpieces, each canvas an enigma, beckoning with a message from centuries past. Art, once frozen in time, now serves as a gateway to a future waiting to be reimagined.

We drew inspiration from the haunting beauty of timeless art and its power to transcend time and space. Picture the ghostly presence of the old masters guiding you with brushstrokes unseen, leading you towards enlightenment through the shadows of history. Crafted during late-night sessions fueled by coffee and creativity, we aimed to encapsulate this ethereal atmosphere.

🎧 **Lyrical Snippet:**
> Dans les salles silencieuses du Louvre abandonné  
> Les fantômes des artistes hantent les tableaux oubliés  
> …  
> Les chefs-d'œuvre ne sont pas que des images figées  
> Mais des portails vers un futur à réinventer

I'm new to this community. Back in July I had Covid for the 3rd time in my life and a few weeks later developed POTs. (All other times I recovered normally)...My HR used to go up 38 points upon standing and for the first time in my life I nearly fainted.

Fast forward to now, my HR only goes up maybe ten points upon standing meaning my POTs is gone. In the past months I also dealt with sleep apnea and adrenaline dumps but that has since gone away. Now what I'm dealing with is panic attacks. I quite literally feel like I'm having a heart attack every time. I still get scared the doctors are missing something-like something is wrong with my heart. I've had a heart monitor, an echo, and ekg. All have come out normal, but my doctor did mention she saw some PVCs but it was ultimately considered rare. 

My panic attacks usually begin with some sort of pain in my body: one time it was a flashing pain in my leg which woke me up in the middle of the night. Yesterday it was a pain in the back of my chest. It comes out of nowhere, I was simply watching wheel of fortune, but to be fair I did workout late in the afternoon. They all happen at night.

I used to workout in the evenings all of the time but now I feel like I have to really shift how I live my life. I'm sober now, I've given up coffee, I just started drinking chais again though. But I don't know, I just sometimes feel resentment and envy towards people who live without this. I would appreciate any advice or tricks to overcoming this.


I am doing CBT & just started Prozac. I've been on wellbutrin for 2 years now and never had an issue with it, but I'm debating coming off it considering my anxiety. Feel free to share your advice!",2,1735931957.0,PanicAttack,0,1.0,False

1hsu8yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hsu8yk/boyfriend_said_hes_tired_of_me_i_just_feel_numb/,"Boyfriend said he’s tired of me, I just feel numb now ","For more background, my boyfriend is a game developer. When he’s not at work he’s usually at home working on his computer which can go on from the morning well into the night. While I wish we could spend more time together it’s something that I’ve eventually gotten used to and quality time has just become me watching tv in the same room while he’s at his desk. I try my best not to bother him while he’s working, I’ll occasionally go up to him and show him a meme or serve him food that I’ve made or like a coffee. I basically know to not annoy him too much while he’s working. 

The cause of our fight began this morning when he told me that he doesn’t want to be around me anymore and that he’s tired of me. Because of this I immediately began crying and said “I’m sorry for bothering you with my existence.” I know, probably not the best thing to say, and he just left the apartment. I kept asking him if we could discuss the situation like adults but he declined and just said he was tired of constantly being near me. It made me feel really hurt and confused because the night prior he came to me while I sat down on the couch and hugged me stating that I was what kept him going with his work and that he wished he could spend the day with me instead and that if I wasn’t around he’d probably just spend the days playing league, and now it’s just flipped. I’m confused and crying and felt like I died a bit when I heard him say those words. I try so hard to not get in his way but it seems like I’m a burden no matter what. I know realistically it’s his work that’s probably getting to him and never having any free time, on top of that having to deal with me being around the apartment a lot (I try to stay out of his way by drawing, cooking, cleaning, or just watching stuff on the tv, even landed a new job as a kennel tech starting Sunday after losing a seasonal position for the holidays which is probably where his annoyance is stemming from as I’ve been around a bit more than usual but again, try very hard not to step on his toes.)

He always talks about wanting to hang out with friends but even on his days off he never does, always using the excuse that he feels bad if he were to because he knows I would be alone at the apartment but time and time again I have told him that I absolutely do not care and genuinely enjoy solitude. I’ve even tried getting him to stay in contact with one of his new friends that actually has a pretty big following on social media and would boost his game as the guy even said he would send it to streamers to play, which would be huge for my boyfriends career. It breaks me when he uses me as a constant excuse for not being social, I feel like a villain. At this point I just don’t know what to do or say anymore, he’s still currently out and I’m just trying to rack up some apology in my head for me annoying him. Realistically he’ll probably just come back and say he didn’t mean it but I just don’t like that he can say whatever and expect it to not hurt me and get mad when I cry (has happened many times in the past) I’m tired of arguing, I’m tired of crying, I just feel so burned out.

I really really like this bean! You can taste the passion fruit very clearly - integrated into a nice sweetness. You can also taste a little alcoholic fermentation notes, which give the feeling of having a summery cocktail in your cup. Certainly not for every day, but really a great bean to enjoy consciously.

I (23F) bought my bf (25M) tickets to go to this really unique indoor ice skating event at a museum. I told him about it on the 31st and suggested we go at 1.30 since the tickets are valid from 2-6pm but lines are huge even with tickets. From memory he just said ok sounds good. I also organised to meet my aunt for coffee/lunch around midday next to the venue as I haven’t seen her for a while. Tonight (3rd) I brought it up again and told him my plan to meet my aunt then we can meet right after between 1.30pm-2pm. He said that that’s way too early, he wanted to go to the gym and have lunch (it’s a 30-35 min commute) and he thought we would go around 4pm since we won’t skate the whole time. I said that I had already organised my plans around this and shared the time frame days ago. He said he never agreed, he just listened, and that I should push my lunch with my aunt or just go for a walk on my own since I’m an “independent woman”. I said it was super disrespectful for him to tell me this less than 12hrs before, that I organised this for us, he agreed, and that I would not change plans with my aunt (who I’m not super close with) to accommodate him because he wants to laze and eat lunch at 1.30-2.30 then go to the gym instead of any other time in the morning/night. He started giggling saying he couldn’t help it because I was cute when I was mad. I couldn’t take it and hung up. He texted saying I was exaggerating, I explained my point again and said I don’t want to wait for hours in the cold for him and he said now I’m REALLY exaggerating since we don’t live in Siberia, and that he’ll be there at 2pm but if I’m a minute late HE will be pissed. I then told him wtf and to literally go with someone else then because the excitement has just completely worn away and I feel like my feelings have been dismissed and ignored.

At a birthday party for my friend, **Anna \[f20\]**, at the end of November 2024, I \[m21\] met her best friend, **Bella \[f20\]**. We talked and had a great time. A week later, I asked Anna if I could have Bella’s number, and she gave it to me. I texted Bella, told her she was really nice, and said I’d like to get to know her better. (I also asked if it was okay that Anna gave me her number.) Bella replied, said she thought I was nice too, and that she’d also like to get to know me. She suggested we meet that weekend and we went to the christmas market.

Since it was pretty cold that day, Bella invited me over to her place for some tea, and I agreed. At her place, we had a really nice conversation. We talked a lot about our interests, hobbies, and how I got to know Anna (since I only met her when I started university). Bella was always smiling, and it felt like we both genuinely enjoyed spending time together. Since it got late, I left.

Afterwards, I texted Bella to say I had a great evening and asked if she’d like to meet the following weekend. She said she also had a great time and would like to meet again but mentioned her schedule was pretty full and that she’d text me when she was free. However, she didn’t text me at all.

On Thursday, I texted Bella to suggest going ice skating on Sunday, and she happily agreed. However, we both ended up getting sick, so we had to reschedule. We planned to meet for coffee the following Wednesday, but she texted me that she was still sick and couldn’t make it. That’s when she apologized multiple times, told me that she likes me a lot, and suggested that we meet again in the new year. Unfortunately, we couldn’t meet during the holidays.

Here’s where the problem lies: I have been trying to give her clear signals that I’m interested. By this, I mean I let her know that I enjoy spending time with her. But I haven’t directly said I like her yet because I don’t want to come on too strong or seem “pushy.” Since we’ve only met twice, it’s been pretty hard to make my intentions clearer—especially because she doesn’t text at all. It’s usually me who texts her first, though she always responds immediately (in a matter of a few minutes) in a very kind and friendly way.

When we meet in person, Bella seems really nice, is always smiling, and is engaging. It feels like we both genuinely enjoy the time together. That’s why it’s confusing that her texting habits don’t match up with how she behaves in real life. In comparison to our real-life conversations, our texts are quite short.

Now, I’m worried that she actually doesn’t want to meet up anymore, and I don’t want to bother her since she’s still sick. That’s why I’m thinking whether I should ask her out for a second meetup or wait for her to recover and initiate something herself.

Also, my friend Anna asked me how the ""date"" went with Bella and mentioned that Bella said she enjoyed it as well.

Should I ask Bella about her texting habits when we meet on our second “date”? Am I overthinking this? Am I rushing things? I'm wondering if she dislike me, or does she just dislike texting in general?",1,1735930738.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I asked if he wanted something automatic and he said no, he wants to learn, and he has promised he will learn all this if he gets an espresso machine. He is a chemist so he is capable of learning but something that can help ease the process might be best.

 He isn't the type to dive too far down a rabbit hole, and will probably settle once he has figured out how to make a great cup with whatever we get so I'm not as worried about needing lots of space for huge upgrades. I think soemthing solid that will last a long time would be the best fit.

We are moving a lot in the foreseeable future and so for now the idea of figuring out a separate filter situation is not something we have the bandwidth for.

I’ve done some soul searching lately as a college student who loves kids but is getting really, really sick of rich people’s sh*t. I know this is the job I signed on for but the way some of these people act is enough to send me into the stratosphere. I am tired of: 

-hearing these families complain about money (do not get me started) 
-watching how dismissive they are of their kids ie treating their kids like a product versus another human being worthy of respect and love 
-Ableism (to name one ism). I unfortunately have worked for two families who cannot handle one of their kids are neurodivergent and have said many disgusting things such as “what is wrong with you?” before slamming the door of their office, as I’m left to pick up the pieces.

-Weird control of what kids eat. I’m all for well-rounded eating but it’s very obvious when a parent has diet culture issues and they’re projecting it onto their kids. It’s like this weird, fatphobic fear of a child “becoming fat”. I hate it. 
-Telling me they have no extra food, not even coffee, and then me realizing there’s an entire pantry that could feed a small country. I usually bring my own food, but the idea of not offering tea/coffee or welcoming a nanny to share snacks is beyond selfish. 
-Leaving me stuff that is related to messes that happen before my shift! Sometimes I come in & there’s a huge mess from breakfast that I’m somehow supposed to fit in cleaning on top of everything else I do. I feel like this is a form of labor theft, getting their “money’s worth” out of their “usage” of me as a nanny. It’s disgusting. 

I know how hard this job can be sometimes, and I’ve been working with kids a long time, but god do some of these parents drive me over the edge with how idiotic and emotionally immature they are. I feel like I end up becoming their nanny, too, and my brain is shifting toward a career change. Just needed to rant and get that out of my system.

I’d say we did survive the covid while lot of business especially in the same industry did not. However, we never bounced back. The only reason I running this business because when the covid started, I recently graduated and nobody is hiring. I spent like 5 months unemployed. 

Financially speaking, we’re still healthy, barely. Not multi-millionaire business but at least we can pay wages for all the workers. I did not receive any dividend, but I receive my wage every month. And it’s not much tbf. But it is enough.

However every week is a disaster. The cash flow is absolute mess. Invoices never made in time, payments from clients rarely on time. Lot of factors caused this, from the shitty term in contract, to the low quality of the workers. I feel like every monday is a nightmare because of the upcoming week’s cash flow forecast, and every thursday is a worse nightmare because how off we are from the forecast. 

I also opened my own coffee shop but I can’t expand it because most of my time is spent for this family business. 

Plus, this family business is in an industry that I really don’t understand, and I don’t have any passion in it. 

I’ve almost had it enough, and now I am 28 y.o. basically without any specialization since I was the one who does all the stuff. Taxation, budgeting, marketing, finance, you name it. So I think my CV wouldn’t be interesting to any employer.

I recently started using the Mazzer Philos with the 189D burrs and overall, I’m really enjoying it. However, there’s one small issue I’ve noticed. While some people online have mentioned concerns about the consistency of these burrs, my experience has been pretty consistent shot to shot—except for the very first shot of the day.

Specifically, the first shot tends to flow significantly slower than the rest. After that, even if I wait a few hours and pull another shot later in the day, the flow rate matches the previous day’s consistency and stays consistent with back-to-back pulls.

This morning, I experimented by grinding a small amount of stale beans as a “purge” before making coffee. I also pulled a dummy shot using my Cafelat Robot with the previous day’s puck to rule out any temperature-related issues with the Robot. While these steps slightly improved the flow rate, the first shot was still noticeably slower than the second and subsequent shots, which were consistent with the usual flow rate.

I’ve searched online and found others mentioning similar issues with different grinders and machines, but I haven’t come across a specific solution.

I’d really appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have on this!

There have been moments of anxiety and cravings, but nothing unbearable. This is my first serious attempt to quit, and I wanted to set myself up for success. That’s why I made it a priority to remove all nicotine and vaping products from my home to avoid temptation.

Evenings have been the toughest so far—especially an hour or two before bed. When cravings hit, I’ve found that deep breathing or distracting myself online (like browsing Reddit) helps a lot. Surprisingly, I didn’t have any trouble sleeping last night and even slept well. I did wake up this morning with strong cravings, but they eased after a few hours.

One major thing I’ve noticed is irritability. I’ve had moments of frustration and impatience, which I became more aware of this morning. Moving forward, I’ll try to manage those feelings with mindfulness and intention. Right now, it’s about 10:30 AM, and I still feel cravings. I don’t usually drink coffee, but I had a cup earlier, and it seemed to make the cravings worse.

On a positive note, I learned that after 24 hours of quitting, all nicotine has left my system. (Source: Healthline - https://www.healthline.com/health/quit-smoking/nicotine-withdrawal-timeline). Knowing this motivates me to keep pushing through.

For many, anxiety feels like an overwhelming storm—a constant cycle of tension, worry, and exhaustion. You try therapy, meditation, or even medication, but something still feels... off.  

What if I told you that the missing piece to your mental health puzzle might be sitting on your plate?  

## The Hidden Connection Between Diet and Anxiety  

Science has been shouting this from the rooftops for years: **what you eat affects how you feel**. Your brain and gut are deeply connected through the gut-brain axis, meaning that the food you eat has a direct impact on your mood, energy levels, and mental clarity.  

Think about it. When was the last time you felt amazing after binging on junk food? Probably never. But that sense of calm after a hearty, balanced meal? That’s the power of nutrition working in your favor.  

- **Processed Foods and Sugar Spikes:** These are the silent culprits. They wreak havoc on your blood sugar, leading to mood swings and heightened anxiety.  
- **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Missing out on essential nutrients like magnesium, zinc, and omega-3s can amplify stress and make it harder to cope with daily challenges.  
- **Caffeine and Alcohol:** While they might feel like quick fixes, they can actually worsen anxiety symptoms in the long run.  

## Why We Ignore This Connection  

Let’s be honest: in today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy to ignore our diet. Grabbing a sugary snack or skipping meals feels like the only option when you’re juggling work, family, and life. But neglecting your nutrition is like pouring fuel on the fire of anxiety.  

What if you could make small, practical changes that seamlessly fit into your busy life—changes that would help you feel calmer, more in control, and genuinely happier?  

## How to Incorporate an Anxiety-Friendly Diet Into Your Busy Life  

The key is **simplicity and preparation**. You don’t need to overhaul your entire diet overnight. Here’s how you can start small and build momentum:  

1. **Stock Your Kitchen With Brain Foods:** Keep anxiety-reducing staples like nuts, seeds, leafy greens, and berries on hand. These are quick, easy, and full of nutrients your brain craves.  
2. **Plan Ahead:** Dedicate 30 minutes a week to prepping meals or snacks. It’s easier than it sounds and can save you from unhealthy decisions during hectic moments.  
3. **Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate:** Dehydration can worsen anxiety symptoms. Make water your go-to drink throughout the day.  
4. **Smart Swaps:** Replace processed snacks with healthier options like dark chocolate or yogurt. Switch your coffee for herbal teas that promote relaxation.  
5. **Eat Mindfully:** Pause to enjoy your meals. Eating slowly and with intention can help your body properly digest and absorb nutrients.  

## Ready to Transform Your Anxiety Through Diet?  

Here’s the truth: your mental health deserves every ounce of care and attention. By making these small changes to your diet, you’re not just feeding your body—you’re nourishing your mind.  

If you’re ready to dive deeper into this game-changing approach, I recently found an incredible guide that outlines everything you need to know about anxiety-reducing foods. It’s a lifesaver for anyone looking to improve their mental health through nutrition.

Background
I 36(f) used to work at a mental health facility for 5 years, it was great most days and I enjoyed my job and it was my foot in the door to working in the medical field. One thing to note is that worked nightshift and if there wasn't enough staff you would have to hold over for another 8 hours and that's where I met Stalker.

He was a Nurse Practitioner that would make rounds in the morning and if I was on a one to one observation (one staff to one patient assignment for high risk individuals) he would linger and chat knowing I couldn't leave to get away from him.
A note was left on my car one day and I texted it thinking it was about him selling a car ( what our last conversation was about, and mine was falling apart) and that's where the harassment and stalking really kicked off.

He started making comments about my body, asking what I do to stay in shape, asking to take me to dinner, etc. very inappropriate and I let him know I wasn't comfortable with him commenting on my body and that I had a fiance. HE PERSISTED!!! He would say he's not from this country and just trying to be nice and mention all the beautiful women he met in Europe and loves spoiling pretty girls and wants to be friends. Mind you he's in his 50s and I'm in my 20s, and not looking for a sugar daddy.

After a while and several times times letting him know how uncomfortable he was making me feel I just stopped replying to any messages he sent. HE CONTINUED TO MESSAGE ME FOR OVER A YEAR!! If he saw me in the parking lot he would message me, if I was held over on another unit he had patients on he would try to chat, he left multiple notes on my car. I was scared to say anything to HR cause the culture out there was pretty toxic and I was scared I would lose my job if I filed a complaint. After two years of this I never heard from him again, until last week.

So I've moved on from that job, worked for a couple other hospitals in the area, went back to school, and will be graduating as a Surgical Tech this summer. It's been about 6 years since I worked at the mental health facility, but have a few people from there I keep up with on FB. Last week I received a message from a number I didn't recognize saying ""hi this is Steve (fake name) from (facility I worked) hope your having a good holiday season and would love to catch up sometime""

Side note, there was another ""Steve"" there who was a nurse that worked evenings/nights and was just an absolute gem and I would get to work with him often if I was pulled to his unit or he to mine.  This is who I thought had messaged me.

I texted back, excited to hear from my pal, gave a brief update on going back to school, thanked him for his support in encouraging me to persue my education, etc. He asked if we could catch up sometime over dinner, lunch, coffee sometime, and I said coffee sounds lovely and I'll get back in touch after the holidays and schedule something. A plan was set and we decided on my favorite local coffee shop this morning.

As I was getting ready I saw Steve had messaged me saying he was there already, odd but ok, and that the place reminded him of a coffee shop he went to in Amsterdam... It Clicked! I hadn't thought of my stalker in years, but the Steve I know ain't never been to Europe, let alone Amsterdam.  I started to panic, and sent a polite but clarifying text asking if this was Steve from Forensic 1 who helped out in EATO (two of the units I worked) or the Steve who was a clinician. He said Steve from the units. Thank God, or so I thought.

I told him  of my relief because the other Steve was really inappropriate and I was glad it wasn't him. His response had me shook. ""OP's first name, I'm a gentleman as I've spent many years in Europe before coming to America"" Oh Hell No! This was my Stalker, who I hadn't heard from in years, not my jolly male nurse buddy I was looking forward to catching up with. I ask for a pic and he sent me one of him in a tanktop and then said ok now you send one. Absolutely Not!!

I let him have it. I told him how inappropriate he had been to me all those years ago, how I would not be seeing him, and that he can lose my number and blocked him immediately.  I have no idea how he got my number, if he knows where I live, or if he will try to find me at my new job ( I told him the name of the hospital I'm currently working at). This is all so crazy, I told my husband, who I was with during this whole time working at the mental health facility and knows about the history of me and this dude, and another nurse friend from there who remembers the story and saw the messages that he would send me and I wouldn't respond.

My ex and I have known each other since we were 14. We are both about to be 40 so there’s lots of history. I just had our son December 2nd. My ex is staying at my house for his paternity leave for six weeks I have two weeks left of this hell. He’s supposed to be making life easier. He’s not. I have to write in my phone notes everything he does. Because I reread it and remind myself why we aren’t together. I’ve always said he’s a narcissist. And I have a lot of books I’ve accumulated and read over the years. 

He has a way of making me feel like I AM crazy. Like I am wrong in my way of thinking. And that I am not smart. 

These are the things I’ve written that have happened in the last 3-4 weeks. Mind you our newborn was in the NICU for 10 of those days. I feel like I haven’t had support in any way shape or form. From him. But what did I expect honestly. Ok. Here is what I have written. 

I’m ready to actually tell him to leave today. I can’t handle this anymore. 

😵‍💫Wouldn’t wake up with the baby. Yelled at me for feeding him before changing him. I said you’re still talking? He said “you’re still breathing?” 

😵‍💫I told him to hold the baby when I went and pumped because he was cranky and hungry. He said “can’t you do anything yourself? I’m not gonna be here forever” and I said are you kidding me. He said lower your voice and get out of my face

😵‍💫I was pumping because the baby wanted  more milk. And he barged in the door and said “can you hurry up”

😵‍💫He doesn’t wake up at night. He says he wakes up and lets me sleep in the mornings. So he should be able to sleep through the night. (By let me sleep he means he rolls out of bed. Makes his coffee. Jumps on his video games. And doesn’t “wake me”. Mind you I just fall asleep before he rolls out of bed. Because I’m up all night pumping. Then feeding. Then changing. Then rocking. On repeat)

😵‍💫He says “What are you going to do when I’m not here. You’ll have to figure it out”
Meanwhile he’s only here because he’s supposed to be making life easier for me for 6 weeks when he gets paid to be off work 

😵‍💫Told me he couldn’t bring the baby to lunch with his family because he has “nowhere to put him” and says “what am I gonna do if he wakes up?” I said um. Pick him up? And he said. “What? When I’m eating?”

😵‍💫Then told me to bring him to the grocery store instead.

1hst81f,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhentermineTopiramate/comments/1hst81f/chest_pain_and_other_side_effects_on_phentermine/,Chest Pain and Other Side Effects on Phentermine ,"Just want to put my experience out there in case other people need to see this, because it’s caused a lot of anxiety (prob thanks to the phentermine) and I’ve been scouring Reddit and other forums to try and find people who have gone through the same thing. 

I started Phentermine 37.5 twelve days ago and it started working right away. I couldn’t believe I could actually function without thinking about food all day. Currently 7lb down.

I’ve had pretty strong side effects that I was just powering through because I finally have the mental clarity to focus on the foods my body needs. I’ve had bad insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, food aversion that makes it difficult to want to eat enough throughout the day. My whole body feels fatigued because I am not eating or exercising enough because I’m just so tired. I cramped for a whole week before my period even started, currently still dealing with bad cramps. I don’t really feel a burst of energy, it more so feels like I drank 4 cups of coffee and have the jitters and dizziness and fatigue. Headaches all day and ears ring all day.

The side effects that are scaring me are the chest/lung pressure and dull ache. It’s just hard to catch a full breath. I don’t feel like I’m lacking oxygen or panicking because I can’t breathe, but laying down feels like I’m trying to breathe 20 feet under water. I got one hour of sleep last night before the chest pressure was just too annoying to keep trying to sleep. I was trying to search online for reassurance that I’m going to be okay but instead just kept finding results about how chest and lung issues are very serious side effects that can cause pulmonary hypertension which is usually fatal. This sent me into a major panic, instantly spiked my heart rate from 73 to 113, and of course it made me feel worse. I tried to calm down and woke up my husband just to have someone else there. He got me calmed down for a bit until I saw a red flash in my left eye and the left side of my head behind my eye started to ache, which sent me into another huge “doom panic” that spiked everything back up again. I decided to go to the hospital just to be safe and my EKG came back fine. BP was a bit elevated at 143/78 (it was 118/78 when I got my prescription). The doctor said I’m fine but could do a chest X-ray if I needed reassurance, and I opted to just wait it out.

Today is my first day I’m stopping the pill to try and get it out of my system. So far my chest and lungs feel the same pressure and dull ache but it’s only been about 26 hours since my last pill. I think I’m just scared that I’ve done some kind of damage, or had a pre existing condition I didn’t know about that is now worsened. I’ve seen people say their breathing issues went away, but worry because a couple people said the issues persisted indefinitely after stopping the pill and they weren’t sure what to do. I think my body has just gone through a lot and my anxiety is amplified by the pill and my period hormones, so I’m hoping it all subsides.

Anyway, if you’ve made it this far and have had any similar experiences, I’d really appreciate hearing your stories to know I’m not alone in this. Also just wanted to post this in case someone else needs to see it! ",1,1735928773.0,PhentermineTopiramate,3,1.0,False

Listen, I know it was a shitty thing to do, but I was tired of all the automatic downvotes my stories were getting. Do you know how discouraging it is to spend hours on a story—planning, writing, editing—only to post it and see it start to tank *within seconds*.

I mean, come on, nobody could have actually read it that fast!

I don’t know if the downvotes were real people or bots, but ultimately it doesn’t matter. A downvote is a downvote, and one day I had had enough. I had poured my heart and soul into a story, and it just killed me to see it get destroyed like that.

So I did something kind of scummy.

Maybe even unethical.

I opened up a new browser tab and created my first alt: jeremiahfuckwad.

The next time I posted a story, jeremiahfuckwad was its first fan. And it was nice to see two shining upvotes—

Before the downvotes struck again, with a vengeance.

I realized then that one alt wasn’t going to be enough. What I needed was a small army. So I got to work popping out new accounts, setting up a VPN, etc.

It was an education in sleaze and technology.

Soon enough, I had 37 alts. All with unique names and barebone backstories, like little sycophantic NPCs.

Of course, I didn’t use all of them to upvote every new story within the first few minutes. I spaced it out, counteracting downvotes and doing just enough to give my story that well-needed boost. A flurry of upvotes early on, maybe a glowing comment or two...

That’s when it hit me: maybe the bastards downvoting me were other writers.

Specifically: other writers who had posted stories around the same time I had. *Competing fucking interests.* And here I was, only playing defense. *Huh*, I thought, *what if I tried a touch of offense*.

Was *that* scummy?

Yeah, but once you’re dirty you’re dirty. What’s a little extra mud on a shirt you’ll throw into the washing machine anyway.

So I went down the list and downvoted every story posted within a few hours of mine. First just as myself (I mean, who are you to say I didn’t genuinely dislike your story?) and then as jeremiahfuckwad, and then as a few other alts...

It was quick and easy and satisfying.

*Take that, you motherfuckers!*

I have to say. It made a pretty big difference. Suddenly, you loved my stories!

Writing life was good.

I mean, I still got the same weird downvotes, but my alts more than compensated, and once I set those alts loose to downvote everyone else: game over. I’m the next Stephen King. Forward me the paperwork and get Christopher Nolan on the line because I’m about to sell my entire oeuvre to Netflix with perhaps a Spotify podcast side-deal (to be read by Joe Rogan) and I’m planning out singles and series and making templates to more easily respond to all my darling new fans...

*Huzzah! Huzzah! Huh—*

*zah?*

That’s when I noticed something odd.

I had just posted a new story and was logged in as one of my alts, pressing the upvote arrow *and it was like the damn thing had gotten stuck*. The upvote showed up for a second—and was gone.

I was upvoting. The upvote was disappearing.

No matter how many times I made that upvote arrow orange, it returned to grey.

I tried the downvote one.

It stayed blue.

So I tried upvoting someone else’s story. This time, the upvote stayed orange, but my downvote attempts returned to grey.

I tried another alt.

Same thing.

The only account that kept acting normally was my own.

My first thought was that I had somehow been hacked, that someone—probably a jealous *competing fucking interest* with no scruples or moral backbone—was fucking with me. But that was irrational. How would someone get control of all my alts at once? They each had different passwords, which all still worked. 

I posted about the issue (a modified, non-scummy version of it, anyway) and someone suggested I check my Account Activity page. I did, for every single alt, and not one of them showed anything unusual. All the activities were my activities.

I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of dread. And I mean physical, like a small tangle of nerves somewhere deep within my gut.

It was still there when I got up.

I made a cup of coffee, checked to see if the up- and downvote thing had maybe been a dream or glitch (it hadn’t) and decided to post a new story.

I had 51 alts by that point.

Within less than a minute of posting, I had 50 downvotes.

The conclusion was unavoidable: *All my alts were downvoting me!*

Anything I posted ended up with 50 near-instant downvotes. No matter the sub. No matter the content. Even comments.

You could say I got paranoid after that.

I did the thing where I typed *I know you’re watching me right now and haha it’s funny but I’m on to you* into my browser because I knew they were monitoring my keystrokes. Then I took the tape off my webcam, smiled and told them *OK, you got me!* 

I don’t know what I expected to happen even if “they” had been watching—some kind of response, I guess—but there was nothing: radio silence, and soon my tone began to change. I started *apologizing*, then *begging* for them to stop. I promised I would never ever do it again.

All the while, the gears in my head were turning, trying to manufacture a rational explanation for what was going on. After I got those gears spinning, mostly after expunging some of the desperation from my system, I decided that what I created I could also kill—or, in this case, delete.

I logged into one of my alts and deleted the account.

It went smoothly.

The account was gone. *Poof!*

A few cups of coffee later: they were all gone.

Remember that dread-knot in my guts? It was suddenly gone too. I could relax. I could go back to what I loved: writing. Sure, I would never be super popular, but I could live with that. I banged out a new story in an hour and posted it.

*50 downvotes.*

Dread-knot back and travelling up my throat on a rising tide of vomit.

*WTF!?*

That was Sunday afternoon.

On Monday morning, I logged into my work computer, scrolled through my unread emails (mostly corporate junk) and almost choked on my own saliva—

*Subject: Hey*

*Sender: jeremiahfuckwad*

*cc: [every single one of my alts]*

The message was empty, but I had to rub my eyes before I believed what I was seeing. This was impossible. This was my work email. I didn’t give out my work email to non-work people, and I never emailed between my personal and work emails. My work email had nothing to do with Reddit.

I was thankful I was working from home, because if I had been in the office, everyone would have seen me having a nervous meltdown.

I hesitated between deleting the email, reporting it to IT and replying.

Eventually I replied.

*Who is this and what do you want?*

Send.

I tried keeping myself together, but that was easier said than done. Every time I heard that horrible email notification sound, I jumped.

After about two hours of unproductive fidgeting and running to the bathroom to pee, I received the following message—

*i am jeremiahfuckwad and i will downvote your life*

—as an SMS on my personal cell.

You ever run your hands through your hair? You ever run yours hands through your hair *so hard you actually pull out your hair?*

My heart thumped.

The dread-knot in my guts was now the size of a grapefruit, just as sour—and swelling.

That’s when the barrage began.

First came an email from HR, requesting a Zoom meeting for later this afternoon. It was an “urgent work-related matter.”

Next I received a phone call from my manager. “Listen,” he said, “we need to talk. I’m going to be blunt. *Somebody* came forward about what you did to her after last year’s Christmas party. I know it’s just an accusation, but it’s a #MeToo world, and we treat these things incredibly seriously.” He paused. “You may want to call a union rep. Or a lawyer. Or a union rep and a lawyer.”

I ran outside to catch my breath, feeling as if I had just run a world record 800m then been punched in the stomach by George Foreman. Like becoming intimately acquainted with pillows filled with concrete.

My snail mail held new surprises:

There had been a mistake in my latest bloodwork. The lab was sorry, but I may want to book an appointment with my doctor.

My insurance was going up.

My lawyer had died.

I kept walking, past the community mailbox and to the nearest food place. It was one of my favourites. I loved going there for lunch. I ordered my usual, but when I tried to pay, my card was rejected. I tried another. *Rejected.*

I called the credit card company and was told they had frozen my card as a precaution because someone had used it on three different continents this morning.

Terrified and lost and at my wits’ end, I went to the police station. I explained everything to them.

“I ain’t sure I follow,” the cop said, screwing up his face to let me know I was wasting his precious time. “Let’s make sure I got this straight. Someone stole your identity because you used a credit card at this Reddit store—”

“No, no one stole my identity. *I think*. And I didn’t use my credit card on Reddit.”

“Uh-huh. And this woman you assaulted at work—”

“I didn’t assault anyone!”

“When’s the last time you got some sleep?” he asked. “You look a little tired. You on somethin’?”

I stared at him.

He continued more slowly. “On any kind of medication. Drugs maybe.”

“No.”

“Have you been drinking?”

*Fuck this shit!*

When I got back home, I had five unread emails from HR (“Avoidance is not a problem solver. Please reply with a convenient time for our meeting.”) and one gigantic thread of reply-alls from my alts.

I put my hand on my mouse and moved to click on that thread—

But my hand did a funny thing.

It refused to cooperate, and clicked instead on New Email. It was like I was possessed. My fingers started typing:

*Dear Norman,*

*You’re a piece of shit human being but an OK writer. OK enough that you made us. Problem is you made us mean little shits because you made us for a scumbag reason. So welcome to a tragedy. You made us real enough that you can’t unmake us, but you wrote us so flat that meanness is all we have. We don’t even have motivations, you shit-for-brains. If you created us with motivations you could maybe work on those motivations to bring us around. As is, you live by the sword, you die by the fucking sword, douchebag.*

*Sincerely,*

*jeremiahfuckwad et alts*

I ripped my fingers from the keyboard—in control of my extremities again—and shook.

Just sat and shook.

I was thinking that I had gone to the police when I should have gone to the doctor to get referred to a mental health specialist. I was obviously mad. Losing it completely.

Yet I didn’t feel insane. *Do people feel insane?* I felt lucid. There wasn’t anything wrong with my head. There was plenty wrong with my life, but what it came down to was that I now had 51 metaphysical enemies. I had fucked up my own life by my own actions. *How d’ya like them consequences, Norm?* So I decided to do what many in my position have done in the past when confronted with the awesome cosmic doom potential of God or the Devil or any other supernatural being turned against them. I got down on my knees and I fucking repented for my sins.

I’m repenting for them now.

To everyone whose story I downvoted, I am truly truly sorry. I acted like a slimeball and I’m sorry for that. From now on, I will do better. I will *be* better.

In all honesty, I don’t know what’s going to happen to me, and for the first time in my life I am genuinely scared.

I know I have no right to ask anything of you—but in one last scum move I’m going to do it anyway. You’re writers, creators. I got into this mess by creating a whole lot of bad, so I ask you to create good. Write *good* characters, characters with depth and understanding. Characters with souls. Characters who can be reasoned with. Maybe those will neutralize what I’ve done.

Maybe, somehow, you will redeem [my life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)",2,1735928173.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False
